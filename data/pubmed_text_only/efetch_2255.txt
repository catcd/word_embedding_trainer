Sensitivity to cadmium (Cd)-induced testicular injury varies greatly among mouse strains. For instance, 129/SvJ (129) mice are highly sensitive while C57BL/6J (C57) mice are refractory to Cd-induced testicular injury. Metallothionein (MT), a Cd-binding protein, is thought to be responsible for the strain susceptibility to Cd toxicity. In this study, MT-I/II knockout (MT-null) and wild-type 129 mice were used to determine the role of MT in Cd-induced testicular injury. Two additional strains of mice (C57 and the C57 x 129 F1cross) were also used to help define the role of genetic background in Cd toxicity. Mice were given 5-20 micromol/kg ip CdCl(2) and testicular injury was examined 24 h later by histopathology and testicular hemoglobin concentration. Cd produced dose-dependent testicular injury in all strains of mice, except for C57 mice, in which testicular injury could not be produced. MT-null mice were more sensitive than C57 x 129 mice but were equally sensitive as 129 mice to Cd-induced testicular injury. Fourteen days after 15 micromol/kg ip Cd administration, testicular atrophy was evident in MT-null, 129, and C57 x 129 mice but was absent in C57 mice. The resistance of C57 mice to Cd-induced testicular injury could not be attributed solely to a decreased uptake of (109)Cd nor to a greater amount of testicular MT. Microarray analysis revealed a higher expression of glutathione peroxidase in the testes of C57 mice, as well as genes encoding antioxidant components and DNA damage/repair, but their significance to Cd-induced injury is not immediately clear. Thus, this study demonstrates that it is genetic strain, not MT genotype, that is mechanistically important in determining susceptibility to Cd-induced testicular injury.
A series of 3-phenyl/ethyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydrothiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-7-yl urea and thiourea derivatives were designed and synthesized. All the compounds have been evaluated for their antiparkinsonian activity in catalepsy induced by haloperidol in mice. A majority of the compounds exhibited significant antiparkinsonian activity after intraperitoneal administration. The most active compound carries methoxy group at 2-position of the phenyl ring. Some of the potent compounds were selected for biochemical estimations of malondialdehyde, glutathione, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase from brain homogenate to highlight the neuroprotective properties associated with them. The results obtained in the present study may lead to the development of a suitable approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease and may be the starting point for the future drug design.
Pterostilbene (PS), a natural dimethylated analogue of resveratrol, is known to have diverse pharmacologic activities including anticancer, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, apoptosis, antiproliferation, and analgesic potential. This paper reports the inhibitory effect of dietary administration of pterostilbene against the formation of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) preneoplastic lesions and adenomas in male ICR mice and delineates its possible molecular mechanisms. ICR mice were given two AOM injections intraperitoneal and continuously fed a 50 or 250 ppm pterostilbene diet for 6 or 23 weeks. It was found that the dietary administration of pterostilbene effectively reduced AOM-induced formation of ACF and adenomas and inhibited the transcriptional activation of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA and proteins in mouse colon stimulated by AOM. Treatment with pterostilbene resulted in the induction of apoptosis in mouse colon. Moreover, administration of pterostilbene for 23 weeks significantly suppressed AOM-induced GSK3beta phosphorylation and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. It was also found that pterostilbene significantly inhibited AOM-induced expression of VEGF, cyclin D1, and MMPs in mouse colon. Furthermore, pterostilbene markedly inhibited AOM-induced activation of Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt, and EGFR signaling pathways. All of these results revealed that pterostilbene is an effective antitumor agent as well as its inhibitory effect through the down-regulation of inflammatory iNOS and COX-2 gene expression and up-regulation of apoptosis in mouse colon, suggesting that pterostilbene is a novel functional agent capable of preventing inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis.
A hallmark of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau into fibrillar aggregates. Recent studies suggest that they accumulate because cytosolic chaperones fail to clear abnormally phosphorylated tau, preserving a pool of toxic tau intermediates within the neuron. We describe a mechanism for tau clearance involving a major cellular kinase, Akt. During stress, Akt is ubiquitinated and degraded by the tau ubiquitin ligase CHIP, and this largely depends on the Hsp90 complex. Akt also prevents CHIP-induced tau ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation, either by regulating the Hsp90/CHIP complex directly or by competing as a client protein with tau for binding. Akt levels tightly regulate the expression of CHIP, such that, as Akt levels are suppressed, CHIP levels also decrease, suggesting a potential stress response feedback mechanism between ligase and kinase activity. We also show that Akt and the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (PAR1/MARK2), a known tau kinase, interact directly. Akt enhances the activity of PAR1 to promote tau hyperphosphorylation at S262/S356, a tau species that is not recognized by the CHIP/Hsp90 complex. Moreover, Akt1 knockout mice have reduced levels of tau phosphorylated at PAR1/MARK2 consensus sites. Hence, Akt serves as a major regulator of tau biology by manipulating both tau kinases and protein quality control, providing a link to several common pathways that have demonstrated dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
Subcutaneous injection of formaldehyde into mouse hind paw elicited pain responses consisting of licking or biting of the paw, which were observed biphasically. The first and second phases were enhanced by melatonin and melatonin, naloxone, prostaglandin E2, respectively. Mice kept in the dark also exhibited hyperalgesic response. When neurotropin was injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to those treatments, hyperalgesia was suppressed to the control level. Aspirin inhibited only the second hyperalgesic phase.
Previous observations suggest that salt loading can help reverse amphotericin-B induced nephrotoxicity. Evidence is presented indicating that sodium supplements provide prophylaxis against the development of amphotericin-B nephrotoxicity. In a retrospective study at Vanderbilt University, 14/21 patients receiving amphotericin B (target dose, 25 mg/day) without salt supplements developed impaired renal function; in 10 instances amphotericin B was temporarily withdrawn. In contrast, only 2/17 patients who received amphotericin B with ticarcillin (with its obligatory sodium supplement) developed nephrotoxicity (P less than 0.01). All four patients, who were receiving the combination of amphotericin B and ticarcillin and who had their ticarcillin therapy stopped, developed nephrotoxicity in the subsequent week. In a prospective observational study at Essen, 20 patients had 24 courses of amphotericin B (target dose, 40 mg/day) with routine supplementation of 1 liter of 0.9% sodium chloride daily. Only two patients showed evidence of nephrotoxicity and no dosage modification of amphotericin B was required in any patient. Four patients with initial evidence of mildly impaired renal function received full supplements without adverse effects or the development of nephrotoxicity. These observations suggest that routine parenteral administration of sodium supplements can help minimize the nephrotoxic potential of amphotericin B.
To evaluate the suppressive effects of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) inhibitors on metastasis, three agents, pentoxifylline (PTX, 0.5% in diet), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 0.5% in diet), and aspirin (ASP, 0.5% in diet) were applied in an in vivo highly metastatic rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model in F344 male rats. Administration of NF-kappaB inhibitors for 8 weeks after induction of highly metastatic HCC by sequential treatment with diethylnitrosamine and N-nitrosomorpholine did not cause any significant change in survival rate or body weight. The incidence of HCC was 100% at week 23, regardless of treatment with NF-kappaB inhibitors. PTX, NAC, and ASP did not exert any significant effect on the development or differentiation of HCCs, although PTX tended to decrease the multiplicity of HCC. Although no lung metastasis was observed in the rats killed at the end of the period of carcinogen exposure, lung metastasis was found in 100% of animals in all the groups at the end of the experiment. Multiplicity of lung metastasis was significantly decreased by PTX and NAC, whereas ASP was without significant influence. The size of metastatic nodules was also significantly reduced in the PTX treatment group. Furthermore, the inhibitory kappa-B (IkappaB) protein level, considered to be a marker for the degree of NF-kappaB transcription, was significantly suppressed by PTX. mRNA expression in HCC for vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is considered to play a key role in attachment of cancer cells to the endothelium, was significantly suppressed by PTX. Among the splicing variants of VEGF, VEGF-A120, VEGF-A144, VEGF-A164, and VEGF-A188, suppressed mRNA expression of VEGF-A188 appeared to be correlated with suppression of lung metastasis formation. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that NF-kappaB inhibitors have the potential to inhibit lung metastasis from rat HCCs in vivo, and PTX is especially promising. Its mechanism of action may involve suppression of VCAM-1 and VEGF-A188 production.
To investigate the expression of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in rats with chronic heart failure, and to explore the effect of beta-blockers on beta(3)-adrenoceptor expression.
Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into Sham (n = 10) and heart failure (n = 22) groups. The heart failure group was treated with normal saline (Heart Failure Control, n = 6), Metoprolol (n = 8) or Carvedilol (n = 8) for 3 months.
The left ventricular end systolic pressure (LVESP) and the absolute values of maximal rate of rise and fall of left ventricular pressure (+/-dP/dt max) in the heart failure group were lower than in the Sham group (P < 0.01), whereas the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was higher (P < 0.01). The LVESP and dP/dtmax in the Carvedilol group were higher than the Metoprolol group whereas LVEDP was lower (P < 0.01). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in the Carvedilol group was less than the Metoprolol and Heart Failure Control groups (P < 0.01). The level of beta(3)-adrenoceptor expression in the study groups was significantly higher than the Sham group (P < 0.01). beta(3)-adrenoceptor expression in the Carvedilol group was lower than the Heart Failure Control and Metoprolol groups (P < 0.01).
beta(3)-adrenoceptor expression is increased in the failing ventricles in rats. Carvedilol is more effective than Metoprolol for improving the hemodynamics and in attenuating ventricular remodeling after heart failure. Carvedilol, rather than Metoprolol, diminishes beta(3)-adrenoceptor expression in the failing ventricles.
The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of using mechanical measures of stretch reflexes to monitor spasticity after intrathecal baclofen dosage changes.
Mechanical measures were made in studying six participants with cerebral palsy who were undergoing treatment for spasticity using intrathecal baclofen therapy. Mechanical measurements of stretch reflexes were made before and after pump implant in four of the six participants and after dosage changes in all participants, for a period of up to 2 yrs. The measurements comprised electromyograms and resistive torque responses to movement of the ankle, imposed with an isokinetic dynamometer. For each test session, random movements were applied to the ankle at each of four to seven speeds, repeated three or five times.
Stretch reflex excitability decreased in three of four participants after initiation of intrathecal baclofen therapy and decreased with increasing dosages in three of the six participants. Broken catheters coincided with heightened mechanical measures in two cases.
Mechanical measures of stretch reflexes change after intrathecal baclofen dosage adjustments, reflecting the clinical course of intrathecal baclofen therapy.
Desmosterol is a C27 sterol intermediate in cholesterol synthesis generated during the metabolic pathway that transforms lanosterol into cholesterol. It has become of particular interest in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the report that the activity of the gene coding for the enzyme DHCR24, which metabolizes desmosterol to cholesterol, is selectively reduced in the affected areas of the brain. Any change in the pattern of C27 sterol intermediates in cholesterol synthesis merits investigation with respect to the pathogenesis of AD, since neurosteroids such as progesterone can modulate the tissue levels. We therefore analyzed the C27 sterol composition using a metabolomics approach that preserves the proportion of the different sterol intermediates. In AD, the proportion of desmosterol was found to be less than that of age-matched controls. The findings do not directly support the focus on Seladin-1, although they could reflect different stages of a slowly progressive disease.
Lithium intoxication causes polyuria, central nervous system manifestations, and ultimately stupor progressing to coma. Moreover, polyuria leading to hypernatraemia itself can progress to convulsions and coma. We present a patient with lithium intoxication who remained polyuric, hypernatraemic and somnolent despite normal serum lithium concentrations. After institution of indomethacin orally, polyuria and hypernatraemia disappeared and patient regained consciousness.
We investigated the effect of the potentially carcinogenic psoralen plus UVA radiation (PUVA) therapy on the expression of p53 in skin of psoriatic patients. p53 antibodies DO7 and Pab240, antibodies against PCNA and Ki67 and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex method were used in the immunohistochemical staining of biopsy samples from non-lesional and lesional skin of 23 patients who received either trioxsalen bath PUVA or oral 8-methoxypsoralen PUVA. Biopsies were taken before and after a PUVA course. A modest expression of p53 was seen in psoriatic lesions in 17/21 patients before any treatment, probably as a physiological reaction to the hyperproliferation. Both p53 and the proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA followed the same pattern, being more frequent in psoriatic lesions than in non-lesional skin. Exposure to PUVA induced an increase in p53 expression in non-lesional skin in 14/19 patients, putatively as a response to DNA damage caused by PUVA. In psoriatic lesions about half of the patients showed increased and half decreased expression of p53. The latter finding might be explained by decreased proliferation activity of the healing epidermis. In conclusion, p53 nuclear positivity in non-lesional skin after PUVA treatment is likely to be induced by DNA damage caused by PUVA, while in psoriatic lesions it could be a result of the combined effect of decreasing epidermal proliferation and DNA-damage.
beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is one of the main protein components of senile plaques contributing to Alzheimer's disease and it can induce neuronal apoptosis. In this study, it was found that icariin, a flavonoid extracted from Chinese Herba-Epimedii, inhibited Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. The peak dose of icariin was 160 microg/ml. In addition, mRNA and protein expressions of cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) were increased in Abeta42-treated neurons in the presence of 80 microg/ml icariin. Moreover, CART-RNA interference was able to reverse neuroprotection of icariin on Abeta42. Furthermore, the expression of CART can be suppressed by extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor instead of p38/JNK inhibitors, suggesting that icariin may be developed into therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Autoradiography of mice injected i.p. with 14C-labelled 1,1-dichloroethylene (vinylidene chloride, VDC) in C57B1/6 mice revealed a selective covalent binding of radioactivity in the proximal tubules, in the midzonal parts of the liver lobules and in the mucosa of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Since VDC is a renal carcinogen in male mice the effects of compounds modulating biotransformation and glutathione (GSH) levels on the renal covalent binding were examined following a single i.p. dose of 14C-VDC. Most pretreatments did not influence the level of binding but treatment with buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione (GSH)-depleting agent, increased the renal covalent binding of VDC three-fold. Histopathological examination of kidneys in BSO-pretreated male mice given single i.p. injections of subtoxic doses of VDC (25 and 50 mg/kg) showed necrosis in the proximal tubules (S1 and S2 segments) 24 h following administration. In mice given VDC only, no significant lesions in the kidneys were observed. The severe renal toxicity of VDC in BSO-pretreated mice is suggested to be related to metabolic activation of VDC in the proximal tubules, resulting in further GSH depletion and covalent binding.
We studied the response of urinary protein overload on preexisting tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), which was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCBD). Five days after the development of TIN, puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) was administered to induce urinary protein overload. Urinary laminin and kallikrein were measured. Urine specimens were collected daily for 14 days and on day 21; and tissue specimens were collected on days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21. Urinalysis was correlated with the renal pathology at the light microscopic level. Laminin excretion was increased on day 4; one day before total protein, indicating damage to the basement membrane. Kallikrein levels also fell early indicating distal tubular damage. There is clear evidence that urine protein overload in a previously damaged kidney with tubulointerstitial injury leads to accelerated and more severe renal damage. Laminin and kallikrein are early and sensitive markers of renal injury.
The clinical course for a patient hospitalized with pneumonia and meningitis due to penicillin-, ceftriaxone-, and cefotaxime-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is described. The pneumonia and meningitis responded to antimicrobial therapy, but the patient died following rupture of an infected abdominal aortic aneurysm; gram-positive cocci resembling S. pneumoniae were detected within the aneurysm.
This study investigated the impact of hypertension combined with diabetic nephropathy on rat renal alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype composition.
In streptozotocin-induced diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), diabetic nephropathy developed as reflected by increased kidney index, plasma creatinine, albumin excretion, creatinine clearance and fractional excretion of Na(+) (all p < 0.05). Renal vasoconstrictions caused by electrical stimulation of renal nerves and intrarenally administered noradrenaline (alpha-adrenoceptor agonist), phenylephrine (alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist) and methoxamine (alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor agonist) were determined in the presence and absence of intrarenally administered amlodipine (Ca(2+) channel blocker), 5-methylurapidil (alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist), chloroethylclonidine (alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor antagonist) and BMY 7378 (alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist).
In diabetic nephropathy SHR, there was a significant (all p < 0.05) attenuation of all adrenergically induced vasoconstrictor responses in the antagonists, except chloroethylclonidine, which caused a significant (all p < 0.05) enhancement of the responses.
The data demonstrated that there was a functional coexistence of alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors in the renal vasculature of SHR irrespective of the presence of diabetic nephropathy. However, there was a minor contribution of pre-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors to the adrenergically mediated vasoconstrictor responses in the diabetic nephropathy SHR.
We report the case of a 2-year-old boy with seizures who developed hepatic failure shortly after commencing sodium valproate. Unexpectedly, liver function returned to normal on stopping the drug. Sequencing of the mitochondrial polymerase gamma gene (POLG1) revealed four heterozygous substitutions, two of which have been identified in cases of Alpers-Huttenlocher disease.
Manganese (Mn) is a potent neurotoxin involved in the initiation and progression of various cognitive disorders. Oxidative stress is reported as one of accepted mechanisms of Mn toxicity. The present study was designed to explore the effects of silymarin, a natural antioxidant, in attenuating the toxicity induced by Mn in rat cerebellum. In this investigation, rats were treated orally with MnCl₂ (20 mg/ml) for 30 days, subsets of these animals were treated intraperitoneally daily with silymarin (100 mg/kg) along with respective controls. Mn exposure caused a marked oxidative stress in cerebellum as indicated by a significant decrease in the activities of enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and in the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants like reduced glutathione (GSH), total thiols and vitamin C. Conversely an increase was obtained in lipid and protein markers such as thiobarbituric reactive acid substances, lipid hydroperoxide and protein carbonyl products contents. A significant increase in acetylcholinesterase and a decrease in Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activities were also shown, with a substantial rise in the expression of acetylcholinesterase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitric oxide levels. The potential effect of SIL to prevent Mn induced neurotoxicity was also reflected by histopathological observations. Rats exposed to Mn showed a reduced number and morphological alterations of cerebellar Purkinje cells. These phenomenons were completely reversed by SIL co-treatment. We concluded that silymarin may protect against Mn-induced oxidative stress in cerebellum by inhibiting both lipid and protein oxidation and by activating acetylcholinesterase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression.
Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) affects large, rural, resource-poor populations in South Asia, Africa, and Brazil. Safe, effective, and affordable new therapies are needed. We conducted a randomized, controlled, phase 3 open-label study comparing paromomycin, an aminoglycoside, with amphotericin B, the present standard of care in Bihar, India.
In four treatment centers for visceral leishmaniasis, 667 patients between 5 and 55 years of age who were negative for the human immunodeficiency virus and had parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive paromomycin (502 patients) at a dose of 11 mg per kilogram of body weight intramuscularly daily for 21 days or amphotericin B (165 patients) at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram intravenously every other day for 30 days. Final cure was assessed 6 months after the end of treatment; safety assessments included daily clinical evaluations and weekly laboratory and audiometric evaluations. Noninferiority testing was used to compare 6-month cure rates, with a chosen margin of noninferiority of 10 percentage points.
Paromomycin was shown to be noninferior to amphotericin B (final cure rate, 94.6% vs. 98.8%; difference, 4.2 percentage points; upper bound of the 97.5% confidence interval, 6.9; P<0.001). Mortality rates in the two groups were less than 1%. Adverse events, which were more common among patients receiving paromomycin than among those receiving amphotericin B (6% vs. 2%, P=0.02), included transient elevation of aspartate aminotransferase levels (>3 times the upper limit of the normal range); transient reversible ototoxicity (2% vs. 0, P=0.20); and injection-site pain (55% vs. 0, P<0.001); and in patients receiving amphotericin B, as compared with those receiving paromomycin, nephrotoxicity (4% vs. 0, P<0.001), fevers (57% vs. 3%), rigors (24% vs. 0, P<0.001), and vomiting (10% vs. <1%, P<0.001).
Paromomycin was shown to be noninferior to amphotericin B for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in India. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00216346.)
The extracellular matrix glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) inhibits angiogenesis, endothelial cell growth, motility and adhesion. Peptides from the type I repeats of TSP1 mimic the adhesive and growth inhibitory activities of the intact protein and specifically interact with heparin and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta). To define the structural basis for the antiangiogenic activities of these peptides, we prepared analogs of the TSP1 peptide KRFKQDGGWSHWSPWSSC. L-forward, L-reverse, and D-reverse (retro-inverso) analogs displayed identical activities for binding to heparin, demonstrating a lack of stereospecificity for heparin binding. The L-reverse and D-reverse peptides, however, had somewhat decreased abilities to activate latent TGF beta. Conjugation of the forward peptides through a C-terminal thioether and the reverse peptides through an N-terminal thioether to polysucrose abolished the adhesive activity of the peptides and enhanced their antiproliferative activities for endothelial and breast carcinoma cells stimulated by fibroblast growth factor-2. Their antiproliferative activities were independent of latent TGF beta activation, because substitution of an Ala residue for the essential Phe residue in the TSP1 type-1 repeat peptide increased their potency for inhibiting TSP1 binding to heparin and for inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation. Although the conjugated peptides were inactive in vivo, an unconjugated retro-inverso analog of the native TSP peptide inhibited breast tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Thus, these TSP-derived peptide analogs antagonize endothelial growth through their heparin-binding activity rather than through activation of latent TGF beta or increasing cell adhesion. These stable analogs may therefore be useful as therapeutic inhibitors of angiogenesis stimulated by fibroblast growth factor-2.
The combustion product acrolein is a key mediator of pulmonary edema in victims of smoke inhalation injury. Since studying acrolein toxicity in conventional in vitro systems is complicated by reactivity with nucleophilic culture media constituents, we explored an exposure system which delivers airborne acrolein directly to lung cell monolayers at the air-liquid interface. Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells were maintained on membrane inserts such that the basal surface was bathed in nucleophile-free media while the upper surface remained in contact with acrolein-containing air. Cells were exposed to airborne acrolein for 30 min before they were allowed to recover in fresh media, with cell sampling at defined time points to allow evaluation of toxicity and protein damage. After prior exposure to acrolein, cell ATP levels remained close to controls for 4h but decreased in an exposure-dependent manner by 24h. A loss of transepithelial electrical resistance and increased permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran preceded ATP loss. Use of antibody arrays to monitor protein expression in exposed monolayers identified strong upregulation of phospho-keratin-8 (Ser(73)) as an early consequence of acrolein exposure. These changes were accompanied by chemical damage to keratin-8 and other intermediate filament family members, while acrolein exposure also resulted in controlled ubiquitination of high mass proteins within the intermediate filament extracts. These findings confirm the usefulness of systems allowing delivery of airborne smoke constituents to lung cell monolayers during studies of the molecular basis for acute smoke intoxication injury.
Tamoxifen and raloxifene are both selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The medicines can block estrogen mediated breast cancer growth and development but will also maintain bone density in postmenopausal women and lower circulating cholesterol. Tamoxifen has remained the antihormonal therapy of choice for the treatment of ER positive breast cancer for the last 30 years. However, although adjuvant tamoxifen produces profound increases in disease-free and overall survival in patients with ER positive breast cancer, concerns about drug resistance, blood clots and endometrial cancer have resulted in a change to the use of aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of postmenopausal women. Nevertheless, tamoxifen remains the antihormonal treatment of choice for premenopausal women with ER positive breast cancer and for risk reduction in premenopausal women who are at high risk for developing breast cancer. The risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic disorders during tamoxifen therapy is not elevated in premenopausal women. It is important to note that aromatase inhibitors or raloxifene should not be used in premenopausal women. Raloxifene is used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and, unlike tamoxifen, does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer. However, raloxifene does reduce breast cancer risk by 50-70% in both low risk and high risk postmenopausal women. Comparisons of raloxifene with tamoxifen show equal efficacy as a chemopreventive for breast cancer but there is a reduction in thromboembolic disorders, fewer endometrial cancers, hysterectomies, cataracts and cataract surgeries in women taking raloxifene. Overall, SERMs continue to fulfill their promise as appropriate medicines that target specific populations for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.
Mallory bodies (MBs) are characteristic morphological features of alcoholic hepatitis and are also found in other chronic liver disorders and hepatocellular neoplasms. MBs can be produced in mouse liver by chronic administration of the porphyrinogenic drugs griseofulvin (GF) and 3,5-diethoxy-carbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC). The mechanisms causing the formation of MBs are poorly understood, and the significance of MB formation during the course of liver disease remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between the mechanisms underlying the formation of MBs and the regulation of multidrug resistance (mdr) genes and their products, the P-glycoproteins (Pgp). Immunofluorescence microscopy using the monoclonal antibody C219 revealed an increase of Pgp expression in almost all hepatocytes after 3 to 8 days of feeding mice DDC- and GF-containing diets. However, after approximately 4 weeks of DDC and approximately 8 weeks of GF feeding, when the first small MBs appeared and loosening and diminution of keratin intermediate filament (KIF) cytoskeleton occurred in some hepatocytes, a decrease or loss of Pgp staining in affected hepatocytes was observed. After feeding mice DDC for 6 weeks and GF for 12 weeks, many hepatocytes contained MBs and displayed a disruption of the immunohistochemically demonstrable KIF meshwork. Double immunofluorescence microscopy with the keratin polyclonal antibody and the mab C219 at this time point revealed a complete loss of Pgp staining in affected cells, although remaining hepatocytes with unaltered KIF meshwork showed a strong reaction with the C219 antibody. Northern blot analyses revealed a significant increase of mdr2 mRNA and, to a lesser extent, of mdr1a mRNA in the livers of DDC- and GF-fed animals.
