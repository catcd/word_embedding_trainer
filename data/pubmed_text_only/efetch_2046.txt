In the present study, we investigated the effects of lipoic acid (LA) in the brain oxidative stress caused by pilocarpine-induced seizures in adult rats. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group), lipoic acid (10 mg/kg, i.p., LA group), pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p., pilocarpine group), and the association of LA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) plus pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before the administration of LA (LA plus pilocarpine group). After the treatments, all groups were observed for 1 h. The enzyme activities [delta-aminolevulinic dehydratase (delta-ALA-D), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and Na+,K+-ATPase] as well as the glutathione-reduced (GSH) and ascorbic acid (AA) concentrations were measured using spectrophotometric methods, and the results were compared to values obtained from saline and pilocarpine-treated animals. Protective effects of LA were also evaluated on the same parameters. In pilocarpine group, no changes were observed in GPx and GR activities and AA content. Moreover, in the same group, decrease in GSH levels as well as a reduction in delta-ALA-D and Na+,K+-ATPase activities after seizures was observed. In turn, in LA plus pilocarpine group, the appearance of seizures was abolished, and the decreases in delta-ALA-D and Na+,K+-ATPase activities produced by seizures as well as increases in GSH levels and GPx activity were reversed, when compared to the pilocarpine seizing group. The results of the present study demonstrated that preadministration of LA abolished seizure episodes induced by pilocarpine in rat, probably by reducing oxidative stress in rat hippocampus caused by seizures.
To report a patient with visual loss after systemic administration of gallium nitrate.
Case report.
After receiving intravenous gallium nitrate, a 77-year-old man developed bilateral visual loss and optic neuropathy with central scotomas on visual field testing and diminished P2-wave amplitude on visual evoked potential examination. The condition worsened after oral corticosteroid therapy. Partial recovery of optic nerve function in both eyes was present after 12 months of oral ferrous sulfate administration.
Partially reversible bilateral optic neuropathy may occur after administration of gallium nitrate in the absence of other chemotherapeutic agents. Ophthalmic examinations are indicated in patients who receive gallium nitrate.
Zonisamide is a new antiepileptic drug which has a wide range of antiepileptic efficacy. This drug is becoming widely to be used for patients with refractory epilepsies. The author reports two patients who developed resting and postural hand tremor after administration of zonisamide. The tremor was confined to the upper extremities and was enhanced with the emotional stress. The tremor has 4-5 Hz frequency and was severe enough to disturb their daily activities. Mild cogwheel rigidity was seen, but neither akinesia nor gait disturbance was recognized. The symptoms disappeared completely after cessation of the drug. This side effect should always be kept in mind in the treatment with zonisamide.
A case of anaphylaxis and angioedema induced by angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), losartan is reported. A 37 years old hypertensive female presented to the Emergency Department with swelling over the face especially the lips, urticarial rash all over the body, and dyspnoea within an hour of losartan administration. She did not have any previous history of drug allergies. The patient was managed with epinephrine. Although angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis are well documented adverse effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, very few cases of these adverse reactions with ARBs have been reported in medical literature.
The endocannabinoid system plays a central role in retrograde synaptic communication, and controls both glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission via type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor. Both in sclerotic human hippocampi and in the chronic phase of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in mice with sclerosis, CB1-receptor-positive interneuron somata were preserved both in the dentate gyrus and in the CA1 area, and the density of CB1-immunostained fibers increased considerably in the dentate molecular layer. This suggests that, although CB1 receptors are known to be reduced in density on glutamatergic axons, the CB1-receptor-expressing GABAergic axons sprout, or there is an increase of CB1-receptor levels on these fibers. The changes of CB1 immunostaining in association with the GABAergic inhibitory system appear to correlate with the severity of pyramidal cell loss in the CA1 subfield. These results confirm the involvement of the endocannabinoid system associated with GABAergic transmission in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), as well as in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model in mice. Pharmacotherapy aimed at the modulation of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling should take into account the opposite change in CB1-receptor expression observed on glutamatergic versus GABAergic axon terminals.
The effects of furosemide on renal function and hemodynamics were evaluated in 54 critically ill surgical patients. Standard clearance techniques were used to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), osmolar clearance (COsm), sodium clearance (CNa), and renal blood flow (RBF). RBF distribution to outer cortex, inner cortex-outer medulla, and inner medulla was measured by the radioactive xenon disappearance technique. Furosemide produced a marked rise in urine output, COsm, and CNa; it produced no change in GFR, RPF, RBF, and RBF distribution. Twelve of the 54 patients received furosemide for therapy not related to the study; six patients developed renal failure and five became hypotensive 2 to 10 hours after administration of furosemide. These data demonstrate that furosemide does not protect against renal failure by altering or increasing RBF but may cause renal failure by producing hypovolemia.
A case of a 13 year old girl who manifested hyperprolactinaemia and galactorrhea induced by Omeprazole, a commonly used proton pump inhibitor is presented.
The efficacy of progesterone in treating patients with endometrial carcinoma is well known. The mechanism, however, has not been understood yet. In this paper, 14 cases of precancerous lesion of endometrium were treated with hydroxyprogesterone caproate and a series of hormone determination was analysed before and after treatment. Results showed that LH and LH/FSH were dramatically decreased. (LH P < 0.05, LH/FSH P < 0.01). It is suggested that the mechanism of progesterone is multiphase, one of them is influence on pituitary and selective interference of LH and LH/FSH.
The authors found that multidrug-resistant human glioblastoma GB-1 cells demonstrated significantly more resistance to cisplatin than did nondrug-resistant human glioblastoma U87-MG cells (p < 0.1). They therefore attempted to determine whether calcium channel blockers enhance the antitumor activity of cisplatin against GB-1 cells. Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, significantly enhanced the antitumor effect of cisplatin on GB-1 cells (p < 0.05). In the absence of normal extracellular Ca++, nifedipine enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. In addition, the antitumor activity of combined cisplatin and nifedipine was inhibited both by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting that such activity is dependent upon new RNA and protein synthesis. Surprisingly, DNA fragmentation assay demonstrated that synergism between cisplatin and nifedipine resulted in apoptosis (programmed cell death) at a relatively low concentration of cisplatin, which when tested alone did not induce apoptosis. In addition, it was demonstrated that nuclei from GB-1 cells lacked a Ca(++)-dependent endonuclease that degrades chromatin into nucleosomes and that calcium ionophore A 23187 did not decrease the viability of GB-1 cells. The above findings suggest the hypothesis that the noncytotoxic agent nifedipine synergistically enhances the antitumor effect of cisplatin on multidrug-resistant GB-1 cells lacking Ca(++)-dependent endonuclease, and subsequently induces apoptosis via its interaction with an as yet uncharacterized functional site other than the calcium channel on GB-1 cells.
This study examined the roles of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and ventral subiculum of the hippocampus in the expression of Pavlovian conditioned hyperactivity responses to cocaine-related stimuli. This was accomplished by pharmacologically inhibiting these regions prior to drug-free tests for conditioned hyperactivity in an environment previously associated with cocaine. The results indicate that conditioned hyperactivity could be disrupted by infusions of the GABA-B agonist, baclofen (0.2 nmol/0.5 microl/side) into the NAc, or completely blocked by infusions of the GABA-A agonist, muscimol (0.1 and 0.2 nmol/0.5 microl/side) into the medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, conditioned hyperactivity was unaffected by pharmacological inhibition of the basolateral amygdala, the ventral subiculum, or sites dorsal to the NAc or prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that the NAc and the prefrontal cortex are crucial elements of the neural circuitry underlying the expression of Pavlovian conditioned responses to cocaine-related stimuli.
1. The nonpeptide bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, FR173657 ((E)-3-(6-acetamido-3-pyridyl)-N-[N-(2, 4-dichloro-3-[(2-methyl-8-quinolinyl) oxymethyl] phenyl]-N-methylaminocarbonylmethyl] acrylamide), was tested in models involving bradykinin-induced activation of primary afferent neurones in vitro and in vivo. 2. Bradykinin-induced contractions of the rabbit isolated iris sphincter muscle mediated by tachykinin release from trigeminal afferent neurones were inhibited in a non-competitive manner by FR173657. A pKB value of 7.9 was calculated. Effects of substance P were unaffected by FR173657. 3. Nociceptive behavioural responses following intraplantar injection of bradykinin in unanaesthetized rats were reduced by 0.3 micromol kg(-1) FR173657 s.c. (P < 0.05), and completely abolished by 3 micromol kg(-1) (P < 0.05). Peroral administration of 5 micromol kg(-1) FR173657 abolished the bradykinin effects (P < 0.05); lower doses had no significant effect. 4. Shortening by intraplantar injection of bradykinin of the paw withdrawal latency in response to radiant heat was abolished by 3 micromol kg(-1) FR173657 s.c. (P < 0.05), while 300 nmol kg(-1) had an intermediate effect. Hyperalgesia induced by prostaglandin E2 remained unaffected by FR173657. 5. Blood pressure reflexes following i.p. instillation of bradykinin in anaesthetized rats were inhibited by FR173657 s.c. with an ID50 of 1.1 micromol kg(-1), while the peptidic B2 antagonist icatibant (Hoe-140; D-Arg0-[Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8]-bradykinin) caused inhibition at significantly lower doses (ID50 8.5 nmol kg(-1) P < 0.001). Responses to hydrochloric acid i.p. remained unaffected by FR173657. 6. FR173657 or similar nonpeptide compounds may be useful for the development of drugs for diseases involving pain induced by the release of endogenous kinins, i.e. especially in acute inflammatory conditions.
Seventy-two patients with duodenal (54) or prepyloric (18) ulcers have taken part in a 12-week double-blind trial. Twenty-four patients received cimetidine, 1 g/day; 24 patients received 10 ml of an antacid suspension (buffering 85 mmol acid) 1 and 3 h after every meal and at bedtime and 0.6 mg L-hyoscyamine in sustained-release tablets twice a day; and 24 patients received placebo. The healing rate after 3 weeks' treatment was 67% (p less than 0.005 compared with placebo) with cimetidine, 50% (p less than 0.01) with antacid/anticholinergic, and 13% with placebo. After 6 weeks' treatment 83% were healed with cimetidine (p less than 0.005 compared with placebo), 96% with antacid/anticholinergic (p less than 0.005), and 33% with placebo. A further 6 weeks' treatment gave healing rates of 96% for cimetidine, of 100% for antacid/anticholinergic, and of 50% for placebo. Compared with placebo, cimetidine but not antacid/anticholinergic caused a faster relief of night-time ulcer pain (p less than 0.05). There was a significant correlation between healed ulcers and complete relief of ulcer symptoms (p less than 0.05). In the placebo group the ulcers of nonsmokers healed to a higher extent than those of smokers (p less than 0.05). During 1 year of follow-up there was no difference between the two actively treated groups in number or severity of symptomatic relapses. Time to relapse was, however, significantly shorter after treatment with cimetidine than after antacid/anticholinergic (p less than 0.05). Recurrences occurred more often (p less than 0.05) after slow healing (6-12 weeks) than after fast healing (3 weeks).
Chlorine gas is a potent pulmonary irritant that affects the mucous membranes and induces severe disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange within minutes of inhalation. The present study evaluated an extraordinary type of mass inhalational exposure.
Clinical reports of 25 soldiers who were admitted to the emergency department of Maresal Cakmak Military Hospital, Erzurum were retrospectively evaluated. All patients were exposed to chlorine gas as a result of mixing sodium hypochlorite with hydrochloric acid during cleaning activities.
All patients were male and the mean age of patients was 22.04+/-2.98 years. The main symptoms were coughing and dyspnea in 18 patients (72%). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced volume capacity (FVC) ratio were found to be normal in all patients but FVC and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were below the normal range (80%) in 9 patients (36%). All patients received warmed humidified oxygen combined with nebulized salbutamol. Inhaled budesonide and nebulized sodium bicarbonate were ordered additionally for 19 patients (76%). Thirteen patients (52%) were discharged from the emergency department and 12 patients (48%) were hospitalized. No mortality was observed.
Chlorine gas is a potent pulmonary irritant that causes acute damage in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. We suggest that inhaled steroids combined with nebulized sodium bicarbonate could be a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of symptomatic patients. Education of the public about the dangers of mixing of hypochlorite bleach with acidic cleaning agents is also very important.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists have been shown to protect the cerebral vasculature, including the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone on changes in venous permeability during chronic hypertension induced by nitric oxide synthase inhibition. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were either treated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 0.5 g/l in drinking water) for 5 wk (HTN; n = 8), L-NAME for 5 wk plus the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone (20 mg/kg in food) for the last 3 wk (HTN + Rosi; n = 5), L-NAME for 5 wk plus the superoxide dismutase mimetic Tempol (1 mmol/l in drinking water) for the last 3 wk (HTN + Tempol; n = 8), or were untreated controls (n = 9). Fluid filtration (J(v)/S) and hydraulic conductivity (L(p)) of cerebral veins were compared in vitro between groups after a step increase in pressure from 10 to 25 mmHg to mimic the change in hydrostatic pressure during acute hypertension. Hypertension increased J(v)/S by 2.2-fold and L(p) by 3.2-fold. Rosiglitazone treatment after 2 wk of hypertension completely reversed the increased J(v)/S and L(p) that occurred during hypertension, whereas Tempol had no effect. These results demonstrate that rosiglitazone was effective at reversing changes in venous permeability that occurred during chronic hypertension, an effect that does not appear to be related to its antioxidant properties. Our findings suggest that PPAR-gamma may be a key regulator of blood-brain barrier permeability and a potential therapeutic target during hypertension.
Well-known adverse effects of amisulpride include nausea, insomnia or tiredness, gastrointestinal, extrapyramidal and endocrine symptoms. Cardiac disorders, however, appear to be an extremely rare complication of the drug. Only a few case reports on this complication have been published so far, which deal with QT prolongation, hypotension, hypertension and palpitations. Bradycardia has not yet been mentioned. Here, we will report on a case of asymptomatic bradycardia that developed subsequent to therapeutic doses of amisulpride in a 25-year-old male patient with chronic paranoid-hallucinatory schizophrenia. The patient had been rehospitalized for an acute exacerbation of the psychosis. When the patient failed to respond at the beginning of hospitalization, the treatment was changed from clozapine to amisulpride. After a complete switchover to amisulpride, the patient's ECG showed sinus bradycardia and QT prolongation. When the daily dose of amisulpride was reduced from 800 mg/d to 600 mg/d, the patient's ECG quickly normalized (including blood pressure and pulse rate) within a few days. The patient did not report any cardiovascular-related complaints. Since the cardiovascular-specific diagnostics did not yield any indicative results, bradycardia may be a rare complication of amisulpride treatment.
Earlier studies suggest that opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area, but not the nucleus accumbens (NAc), play a role in relapse to drug-seeking behavior. However, environmental stimuli that elicit relapse also release the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin in the NAc. Using a within-session extinction/reinstatement paradigm in rats that self-administer cocaine, we found that NAc infusions of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist DAMGO moderately reinstated responding on the cocaine-paired lever at low doses (1.0-3.0 ng/side), whereas the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonist DPDPE induced greater responding at higher doses (300-3000 ng/side) that also enhanced inactive lever responding. Using doses of either agonist that induced responding on only the cocaine-paired lever, we found that DAMGO-induced responding was blocked selectively by pretreatment with the MOR antagonist, CTAP, whereas DPDPE-induced responding was selectively blocked by the DOR antagonist, naltrindole. Cocaine-primed reinstatement was blocked by intra-NAc CTAP but not naltrindole, indicating a role for endogenous MOR-acting peptides in cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. In this regard, intra-NAc infusions of beta-endorphin (100-1000 ng/side) induced marked cocaine-seeking behavior, an effect blocked by intra-NAc pretreatment with the MOR but not DOR antagonist. Conversely, cocaine seeking elicited by the enkephalinase inhibitor thiorphan (1-10 microg/side) was blocked by naltrindole but not CTAP. MOR stimulation in more dorsal caudate-putamen sites was ineffective, whereas DPDPE infusions induced cocaine seeking. Together, these findings establish distinct roles for MOR and DOR in cocaine relapse and suggest that NAc MOR could be an important therapeutic target to neutralize the effects of endogenous beta-endorphin release on cocaine relapse.
We have investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene expression and localization and generated knockout mice to study the role of the M1 muscarinic receptor in vivo. We have used the MDCK cell system to demonstrate that different subtypes of mAChR can be targeted to different regions of polarized cells. We have also examined the developmental regulation of mAChR expression in the chick retina. Early in development, the M4 receptor is the predominant mAChR while the levels of the M2 and M3 receptors increase later in development. The level of M2 receptor is also initially very low in retinal cultures and undergoes a dramatic increase over several days in vitro. The level of M2 receptor can be increased by a potentially novel, developmentally regulated, secreted factor produced by retinal cells. The promoter for the chick M2 receptor gene has been isolated and shown to contain a site for GATA-family transcription factors which is required for high level cardiac expression. The M2 promoter also contains sites which mediate induction of transcription in neural cells by neurally active cytokines. We have generated knockout mice lacking the M1 receptor and shown that these mice do not exhibit pilocarpine-induced seizures and muscarinic agonist-induced suppression of the M-current potassium channel in sympathetic neurons.
During the brain growth spurt, the brain develops and modifies rapidly. In rodents this period is neonatal, spanning the first weeks of life, whereas in humans it begins during the third trimester and continues 2 yr. This study examined whether different anesthetic agents, alone and in combination, administered to neonate mice, can trigger apoptosis and whether behavioral deficits occur later in adulthood.
Ten-day-old mice were injected subcutaneously with ketamine (25 mg/kg), thiopental (5 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg), propofol (10 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg), a combination of ketamine (25 mg/kg) and thiopental (5 mg/kg), a combination of ketamine (25 mg/kg) and propofol (10 mg/kg), or control (saline). Fluoro-Jade staining revealed neurodegeneration 24 h after treatment. The behavioral tests--spontaneous behavior, radial arm maze, and elevated plus maze (before and after anxiolytic)--were conducted on mice aged 55-70 days.
Coadministration of ketamine plus propofol or ketamine plus thiopental or a high dose of propofol alone significantly triggered apoptosis. Mice exposed to a combination of anesthetic agents or ketamine alone displayed disrupted spontaneous activity and learning. The anxiolytic action of diazepam was less effective when given to adult mice that were neonatally exposed to propofol.
This study shows that both a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A agonist (thiopental or propofol) and an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist (ketamine) during a critical stage of brain development potentiated neonatal brain cell death and resulted in functional deficits in adulthood. The use of thiopental, propofol, and ketamine individually elicited no or only minor changes.
Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by the accumulation of much thrombi material consisting of lipoproteins at the glomerular capillary lumen. Most patients show nephrotic syndrome; nearly half progress to chronic renal failure. Intensive therapy with lipid-lowering agents reportedly engenders clinical remission with histological resolution. We report the case of a 14-year-old Japanese female patient who had been in a nephrotic condition with hematuria from 4 years old and who had been diagnosed based on pathological and molecular examination at 7 years old. We initially treated the patient with probucol, enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor: ACEI), and dipyridamole from age 7, but achieved no improvement in her nephrotic status. Subsequently, we replaced probucol with bezafibrate at age 11 and added atorvastatin calcium hydrate and valsartan (angiotensin II receptor blocker: ARB) the following year. The next 3 years' treatment improved her nephrotic status, decreased serum apolipoprotein E, and markedly decreased intraglomerular lipoprotein thrombi. Early and intensive therapy with antilipidemic drugs combined with ACEI and ARB is inferred to be effective for LPG.
Early investigations have suggested a relationship between hypertension and melatonin, a pineal hormone. The aims of this study were to evaluate the implication of the sympathetic nervous system in the acute effect of melatonin on blood pressure in conscious 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), and to determine whether the hypotensive effect of melatonin is associated with alterations in pre- or postsynaptic mechanisms. Melatonin, 10 mg/kg, produced a sustained time-dependent decrease of mean arterial pressure only in SHR without changes in heart rate in both groups. Until 20 min after melatonin administration, plasma epinephrine (EPI) levels were reduced by about 60% in both groups, but norepinephrine (NE) levels were decreased only in SHR by about 30%. The nitroprusside-induced hypotension responses and the associated increases in heart rate were similar in both groups before or after administration of melatonin. Unexpectedly, the sympathetic reactivity to nitroprusside, evaluated by the increases in NE and EPI, was markedly enhanced after melatonin treatment in both WKY and SHR. The stimulation induced [3H]-norepinephrine release from isolated atria was not altered by melatonin in SHR. In cultured aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, the basal and phenylephrine induced inositol phosphate formations were greater in SHR, and the melatonin pretreatment dose dependently attenuated the phenylephrine responses in cells from both WKY and SHR. Therefore the hypotensive action of melatonin appears to be associated with an inhibition of basal sympathoadrenal tone and could also be mediated partly by the blockade of postsynaptic alpha1-adrenergic receptor-induced inositol phosphate formation.
The statins are highly effective in lowering cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase. Recently, there has been conflicting epidemiologic data indicating that statins decrease the incidence of certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. Atorvastatin and lovastatin, statins with different lipophicilities, were administered in diet either as single agents or in combination with suboptimal doses of tamoxifen or the retinoid X receptor agonist bexarotene were evaluated for prevention of estrogen receptor-positive mammary cancers induced in the rat with methylnitrosourea. Atorvastatin (125 or 500 mg/kg diet) alone did not significantly alter cancer incidence or multiplicity. Suboptimal doses of tamoxifen (0.4 mg/kg diet) or bexarotene (80 mg/kg diet) reduced cancer multiplicity from 3.8 (control) to 2.9 and 0.9, respectively. Combining atorvastatin (500 mg/kg diet) with either of these effective agents minimally altered their efficacy. Although this dose of atorvastatin did not decrease serum triglyceride levels in control rats, it significantly decreased triglyceride levels that had been increased in bexarotene-treated rats. Experiments done with a second statin, lovastatin (100 and 400 mg/kg diet), yielded similar results: (a) limited activity when administered alone, (b) no obvious synergy with bexarotene, and (c) an ability to decrease bexarotene-induced increases in serum triglycerides. Thus, the statins had minimal activity in this model of mammary cancer in which approximately half of the cancers are mutated in the Ha Ras oncogene. Similarly, atorvastatin failed to alter the development of estrogen receptor-negative mammary carcinomas in a new animal model using bitransgenic mice (MMTV-Neu(+/-)/p53KO(+/-)), whereas bexarotene (250 mg/kg diet) was effective.
Preclinical models that accurately reproduce specific aspects of human disease etiology are invaluable for the initial development and evaluation of chemopreventive agents. We developed a novel, short-term prevention model, which is particularly useful for assessing the efficacy of a compound to prevent hormonally responsive and nonresponsive in situ carcinomas. In this model, carcinogenesis is induced by a high titer of neu-containing, replication-defective retrovirus. The multiplicity and size of the resulting in situ carcinomas are scored in whole-mounted, aluminum carmine-stained mammary glands at 15 days postinfusion. These in situ carcinomas represent a distinct biological time point in the development of neu-induced mammary cancer in the rat. They are characterized by high rates of proliferation (40.0%; P < 0.0001) and apoptosis (2.8%; P < 0.005) compared with mammary carcinomas. The majority of in situ carcinomas regress spontaneously after 20 days postinfusion. The in situ carcinomas at 15 days postinfusion exhibit hormonal responsiveness. The effects of the chemoprevention agents tamoxifen, celecoxib, and targretin on hormonally responsive and nonresponsive in situ carcinomas recapitulate those observed on mammary carcinomas at 12 and 18 weeks postinfusion for intact and ovariectomized rats, respectively. Neu-induced in situ carcinomas in the rat represent etiologically relevant intermediate time points of mammary carcinogenesis. Our prevention model represents a cost-efficient in vivo system to determine whether the preventive effects of a compound extend to hormonally nonresponsive mammary lesions, for which new chemoprevention approaches are needed.
A case of sensory neuropathy secondary to prolonged administration of metronidazole (MT) and tinidazole (TNZ) is reported. The patient received in the 6 months prior to admission, enough cumulative MT and TNZ to explain the development of a secondary neuropathy as reported in the literature. The present case is particularly interesting due to the length of evolution (38 months) which is the most prolonged reported up to now. It is also the first MT and TNZ neuropathy case reported in Spanish.
Several clinical studies have shown the beneficial cardiovascular effects of fibrates in patients with diabetes and insulin resistance. The ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in nondiabetic animals. We hypothesized that the activation of PPAR-alpha would exert cardioprotection in type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, involving mechanisms related to nitric oxide (NO) production via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. GK rats and age-matched Wistar rats (n >or= 7) were given either 1) the PPAR-alpha agonist WY-14643 (WY), 2) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 3) WY and the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA), 4) l-NNA, 5) WY and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, or 6) wortmannin alone intravenously before a 35-min period of coronary artery occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Infarct size (IS), expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inducible NO synthase, and Akt as well as nitrite/nitrate were determined. The IS was 75 +/- 3% and 72 +/- 4% of the area at risk in the Wistar and GK DMSO groups, respectively. WY reduced IS to 56 +/- 3% in Wistar (P < 0.05) and to 46 +/- 5% in GK rats (P < 0.001). The addition of either l-NNA or wortmannin reversed the cardioprotective effect of WY in both Wistar (IS, 70 +/- 5% and 65 +/- 5%, respectively) and GK (IS, 66 +/- 4% and 64 +/- 4%, P < 0.05, respectively) rats. The expression of eNOS and eNOS Ser1177 in the ischemic myocardium from both strains was increased after WY. The expression of Akt, Akt Ser473, and Akt Thr308 was also increased in the ischemic myocardium from GK rats following WY. Myocardial nitrite/nitrate levels were reduced in GK rats (P < 0.05). The results suggest that PPAR-alpha activation protects the type 2 diabetic rat myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury via the activation of the PI3K/Akt and NO pathway.
Pediatric patients undergoing anorectal manometry require ketamine anesthesia as other anesthetic agents affect the anorectal sphincter tone. The aim of this prospective observational audit was to evaluate our practice and report the occurrence of adverse events and behavioral reactions related to the use of ketamine, propofol, and midazolam combinations.
Eighty-two consecutive pediatric patients (mean age 8.06 +/- 3.43 years) undergoing anorectal manometry were audited over a 1-year period. After a routine ketamine anesthetic some children were administered midazolam 0.1 mg.kg(-1), at the discretion of the attending anesthetist. Children requiring anal stretch following manometry studies also received propofol 3-5 mg.kg(-1). Intra- and postoperative adverse events, times to spontaneous awakening and discharge from the PACU were noted. Postoperative behavioral reactions were noted in the PACU and at follow-up interviews on the first postoperative day and after a period of 1 month.
Following completion of the audit, all patients fell into one of the four groups depending on the anesthetic agents they received: K (ketamine only, n = 16), KM (ketamine and midazolam, n = 10), KP (ketamine and propofol, n = 27), and KPM (ketamine, propofol, and midazolam, n = 29). There was no difference in the occurrence of behavioral reactions between the four groups at the three stages of follow-up. Overall, five patients reported 'new onset' nightmares that had resolved completely at the 3-month follow-up. The time to spontaneous awakening was shorter for K group (17.8 min +/- 20.2) vs KPM group (61.7 min +/- 24.4; P < 0.001). The times to discharge in minutes was also shorter in the K group (54.5 min, IQR 30-75 vs 90 min IQR 78-120; P < 0.001). Administration of propofol appeared to have an antiemetic effect [odds ratio (OR) 0.1, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.02-0.58, P < 0.009] in the recovery unit.
Our study findings suggest that, besides significantly prolonging time to spontaneous awakening and PACU discharge, neither the use of midazolam, propofol, or combinations is beneficial in preventing the occurrence of behavioral reactions following ketamine anesthesia. Behavioral reactions were common but did not appear to be long-term. Drug combinations with ketamine may have other benefits such as antiemesis.
Surgical or pharmacological ablation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reduces the discriminative stimulus and reinforcing effects of cocaine in laboratory rodents. We have recently reported that attenuation of cocaine-induced increases in cortisol does not modulate the subjective effects of smoked cocaine in humans. To examine whether attenuation of HPA function at the pituitary level reduces the effects of cocaine in humans, eight 'crack' cocaine abusers were pre-treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (0 and 2 mg), 10 h before receiving cocaine. Three doses of smoked cocaine (0, 12 and 50 mg) were administered in counterbalanced order under each pre-treatment condition. Dexamethasone alone increased heart rate and blood pressure, and completely abolished cocaine-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol release. Maximal heart rate following cocaine administration was significantly increased by dexamethasone. However, the subjective effects of cocaine were not affected by dexamethasone pre-treatment. These results extend our earlier findings with humans, indicating that the role of the HPA axis in mediating the effects of cocaine is limited. These data are concordant with findings in non-human primates, but contrast with findings in laboratory rodents, thus underscoring the importance of validation of rodent models with laboratory studies in humans.
