Despite an overall decrease in incidence of and mortality from cancer, about 40% of Americans will be diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime, and around 20% will die of it. Current approaches to test carcinogenic chemicals adopt the 2-year rodent bioassay, which is costly and time-consuming. As a result, fewer than 2% of the chemicals on the market have actually been tested. However, evidence accumulated to date suggests that gene expression profiles from model organisms exposed to chemical compounds reflect underlying mechanisms of action, and that these toxicogenomic models could be used in the prediction of chemical carcinogenicity.
In this study, we used a rat-based microarray dataset from the NTP DrugMatrix Database to test the ability of toxicogenomics to model carcinogenicity. We analyzed 1,221 gene-expression profiles obtained from rats treated with 127 well-characterized compounds, including genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens. We built a classifier that predicts a chemical's carcinogenic potential with an AUC of 0.78, and validated it on an independent dataset from the Japanese Toxicogenomics Project consisting of 2,065 profiles from 72 compounds. Finally, we identified differentially expressed genes associated with chemical carcinogenesis, and developed novel data-driven approaches for the molecular characterization of the response to chemical stressors.
Here, we validate a toxicogenomic approach to predict carcinogenicity and provide strong evidence that, with a larger set of compounds, we should be able to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the predictions. We found that the prediction of carcinogenicity is tissue-dependent and that the results also confirm and expand upon previous studies implicating DNA damage, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and regenerative pathology in the response to carcinogen exposure.
To assess whether the increased risk of ibutilide-induced torsade de pointes in patients with heart failure may be due to increased ibutilide exposure, we sought to determine if the pharmacokinetics of ibutilide are altered in patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Multicenter, prospective pharmacokinetic study.
Four academic medical centers in the United States.
Sixteen adult patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring conversion to normal sinus rhythm: six patients who had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction (mean +/- SD left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 30 +/- 9%); 10 patients who did not have left ventricular dysfunction (mean +/- SD LVEF 54 +/- 5% in six of these 10 patients) served as controls.
All patients received a single dose of ibutilide 1.0 mg administered intravenously over 10 minutes. Blood samples were obtained through an indwelling catheter in the contralateral arm before ibutilide administration, at the end of the infusion, and at 5, 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 hours after the infusion.
Serum ibutilide concentrations were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. No significant differences were noted between the heart failure and normal left ventricular function groups in the following parameters: maximum serum ibutilide concentration (median [interquartile range] 3.8 [2.3-5.7] vs 5.8 [3.1-14.4] microg/L, p=0.31), area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (mean +/- SD 11.0 +/- 9.4 vs 13.2 +/- 10.6 microg*hr/L, p=0.88), steady-state volume of distribution (1380 +/- 334 vs 1390 +/- 964 L, p=0.99), systemic clearance (129 +/- 60 vs 125 +/- 81 L/hr, p=0.92), or half-life (12.5 +/- 10.7 vs 12.4 +/- 8.6 hrs, p=0.99).
The pharmacokinetics of ibutilide do not appear to be altered in patients with NYHA class II or III heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Therefore, the increased risk of ibutilide-induced torsade de pointes in patients with heart failure does not appear to be due to increased ibutilide exposure.
Camptothecin (CPT)-11 (irinotecan) has been used widely for cancer treatment, particularly metastatic colorectal cancer. However, up to 40% of treated patients suffer from severe late diarrhea, which prevents CPT-11 dose intensification and efficacy. CPT-11 is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed by hepatic and intestinal carboxylesterase to form SN-38, which in turn is detoxified primarily through UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1)-catalyzed glucuronidation. To better understand the mechanism associated with toxicity, we generated tissue-specific Ugt1 locus conditional knockout mouse models and examined the role of glucuronidation in protecting against irinotecan-induced toxicity. We targeted the deletion of the Ugt1 locus and the Ugt1a1 gene specifically in the liver (Ugt1(ΔHep)) and the intestine (Ugt1(ΔGI)). Control (Ugt1(F/F)), Ugt1(ΔHep), and Ugt1(ΔGI) adult male mice were treated with different concentrations of CPT-11 daily for four consecutive days. Toxicities were evaluated with regard to tissue glucuronidation potential. CPT-11-treated Ugt1(ΔHep) mice showed a similar lethality rate to the CPT-11-treated Ugt1(F/F) mice. However, Ugt1(ΔGI) mice were highly susceptible to CPT-11-induced diarrhea, developing severe and lethal mucositis at much lower CPT-11 doses, a result of the proliferative cell loss and inflammation in the intestinal tract. Comparative expression levels of UGT1A1 in intestinal tumors and normal surrounding tissue are dramatically different, providing for the opportunity to improve therapy by differential gene regulation. Intestinal expression of the UGT1A proteins is critical toward the detoxification of SN-38, whereas induction of the UGT1A1 gene may serve to limit toxicity and improve the efficacy associated with CPT-11 treatment.
It has been shown that cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality appear to be mediated by serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission, respectively. However, many antidepressants considered for treatment of cocaine addiction target these monoamine systems and may thus amplify these toxic effects during relapse. In this study, the authors assessed whether pretreatment with antidepressants influences cocaine-induced toxicity in mice as well as the potency of these medications at cocaine-binding sites previously shown to be associated with cocaine toxicity. Overall, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) facilitated cocaine-induced convulsions but not lethality. Dopamine uptake inhibition facilitated cocaine-induced lethality, but not convulsion. The SSRI sertraline enhanced neither convulsions nor lethality and may be unique due to its high affinity for sigma receptors. These results have important implications for safe and effective addiction treatments.
The effects of inhaled particulate matter in the workplace and outdoor environment on sensitive subpopulations are not sufficiently investigated in human and animal models. Thus, animal models for pulmonary diseases are necessary for appropriate risk assessment of toxic materials. We studied biochemical characteristics of an acute inflammatory process induced by inhalation of nickel chloride aerosols in rats. Acute bronchiolitis was induced by inhalation of nickel chloride aerosols for 5 days in Wistar rats according to the method described by Kyono et al. (1999). Deterioration and recovery from inflammatory responses were evaluated by analyzing markers of inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Experimental animals were sacrificed during and after the nickel aerosol exposure period. The number of neutrophils markedly increased to approximately 0.5 x 10(3) cells/microl BAL fluid during nickel aerosol exposure, accompanied by increase of total protein, soluble L-selectin, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant/growth-regulated gene products (CINC/GRO), elastolytic activity, trypsin inhibitory capacity, beta-glucuronidase activity, fucose, and sialic acid in BAL fluid compared with those of the control group. There was correlation between number of leukocytes and soluble L-selectin concentration. The number of pulmonary macrophages in BAL fluid decreased to approximately 15% of those of the control group on the days of nickel aerosol exposure. The level of CINC/GRO recovered to that of the control group on day 3 after cessation of the nickel aerosol exposure. However, other inflammatory markers remained at the elevated levels. Changes in the markers of inflammation during and after the nickel aerosol exposure were consistent with previously reported morphological findings. The results indicated that this animal model is potentially useful as an acute bronchiolitis model.
To compare opioid requirements in opioid-tolerant and opioid-naïve patients after total knee arthroplasty, and to compare pain scores, sedation scores, and adverse effects between the groups.
Prospective, observational study.
Academic medical center.
Twenty-nine patients aged 18 years or older who underwent elective total knee arthroplasty between October 1, 2005, and June 31, 2007.
Patients were classified on the basis of their daily opioid consumption during the week before surgery: those who required 10 mg or less of oral morphine equivalent were considered opioid naïve (20 patients), and those who required at least 30 mg of oral morphine equivalent were opioid tolerant (nine patients). Postoperative opioid consumption, pain scores, sedation scores, and adverse effects were compared between the two groups up to 48 hours after discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Postoperative opioid consumption (in intravenous morphine equivalents) was significantly greater in the opioid-tolerant group than in the opioid-naïve group in the PACU (median 56 vs 8.2 mg, p=0.0013), during the first 24 hours after discharge from the PACU (108 vs 20.5 mg, p=0.0004), and 24-48 hours after discharge from the PACU (152.3 vs 25 mg, p=0.0001). Pain scores, assessed by using a verbal numeric scale from 0-10, were significantly greater in the opioid-tolerant group than in the opioid-naïve group during the first 24 hours after discharge from the PACU (5.9 vs 4.1, p=0.03). We observed no significant difference in pain scores during the other time periods studied. Sedation scores and adverse effects were similar between groups.
After total knee arthroplasty, patients tolerant to opioids required significantly more opioids in the PACU and up to 48 hours after discharge from the PACU than did opioid-naïve patients. Opioid-tolerant patients also experienced greater pain during the first 24 hours after discharge from the PACU; however, sedation scores and adverse effects did not appear to be significantly different at any of the time periods studied. Clinicians need to be aggressive with pain management immediately after surgery and ensure that patients restart any opioid treatment at home as soon as possible.
A 59-year-old woman has been treated for 5 months with penicillamine for a rheumatoid arthritis and developed a myasthenia syndrome with ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia and asthenia. This myasthenia was slowly cured after suppression of the penicillamine and administration of Mestinon, so that after 3 months, the anticholinesterase medication could be stopped.
The middle facial necrosis is a rare pathology that can be found related to multiple processes that can provoque it: traumatic, chemical, infections, inflammatory and tumorals. So for its diagnosis we require a wide differential diagnosis. We present a clinic case of a nose aspirated cocaine female patient who came to our department with a middle-facial necrosis not telling to us in the anamnesis the cocaine use. We were obliged to do multiple diagnostic tests searching other possible causes.
1,2,3-Trichloropropane is widely used in industrial and agricultural production. However 1,2,3-trichloropropane poisoning has been rarely encountered in clinical practices. Here, a 45-year-old farmer who suffered fulminant hepatic failure due to ingestion of 1,2,3-trichloropropane has been reported and literature about 1,2,3-trichloropane poisoning has been reviewed. For this case, reduced glutathione, vitamin K, pantoprazole were infused intravenously, and transfusion of blood plasma, platelets and red blood cells were carried out. Unfortunately, the patient's family gave up treatment and they left the hospital with the patient because of the low chance of recovery 20 hr after admission. Based on blood toxicology screening, patient history and rapid deterioration of the patient, the cause of fulminant hepatic failure was determined to be acute intoxication of 1,2,3-trichloropropane by unintentional toxicity. 1,2,3-trichloropropane has histopathological toxic effects on many organs and this toxic effect occurs within a short period after ingestion, with liver as the major affected organ.
Three cases are described in which the cessation of the H2-antagonist ranitidine was followed by a rapid improvement in severe depressive symptoms. The literature concerning H2-receptor antagonists and depression is reviewed, and an alternative drug (omeprazole) for severe peptic ulceration is discussed.
Oxalate is a metabolic end product excreted by the kidney. Mild increases in urinary oxalate are most commonly associated with Nephrolithiasis. Chronically high levels of urinary oxalate, as seen in patients with primary hyperoxaluria, are driving factor for recurrent renal stones, and ultimately lead to renal failure, calcification of soft tissue and premature death. In previous studies others and we have demonstrated that high levels of oxalate promote injury of renal epithelial cells. However, methods to monitor oxalate induced renal injury are limited. In the present study we evaluated changes in expression of Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) in response to oxalate in human renal cells (HK2 cells) in culture and in renal tissue and urine samples in hyperoxaluric animals which mimic in vitro and in vivo models of hyper-oxaluria. Results presented, herein demonstrate that oxalate exposure resulted in increased expression of KIM-1 m RNA as well as protein in HK2 cells. These effects were rapid and concentration dependent. Using in vivo models of hyperoxaluria we observed elevated expression of KIM-1 in renal tissues of hyperoxaluric rats as compared to normal controls. The increase in KIM-1 was both at protein and mRNA level, suggesting transcriptional activation of KIM-1 in response to oxalate exposure. Interestingly, in addition to increased KIM-1 expression, we observed increased levels of the ectodomain of KIM-1 in urine collected from hyperoxaluric rats. To the best of our knowledge our studies are the first direct demonstration of regulation of KIM-1 in response to oxalate exposure in renal epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that detection of KIM-1 over-expression and measurement of the ectodomain of KIM-1 in urine may hold promise as a marker to monitor oxalate nephrotoxicity in hyperoxaluria.
Risperidone has been reported as a well-tolerated antipsychotic in children. The most common side effects of risperidone are anxiety, headaches, insomnia, and agitation, which frequently appear with high doses. Although it is known that risperidone affects the cardiac conduction system, symptomatic bradycardia has not been reported previously in children. We report a child who developed syncope because of sinus arrest with long pauses (>3 seconds) with therapeutic doses of risperidone. This case suggests that close monitoring is mandatory even during therapeutic treatment with risperidone.
The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the frequency of expression of the interleukin-11 receptor alpha subunit (IL-11Ralpha) and its signal transducing subunit, gp130, among primary ovarian carcinomas; (2) the frequency of expression of IL-11 in ovarian carcinomas; and (3) the potential role IL-11 might have in ovarian cancer cell biology.
An immunohistochemical assay was used to determine the expression of IL-11Ralpha and the gp130 cofactor among primary ovarian carcinomas; the expression of IL-11 in ovarian malignancies was determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The ability of IL-11 to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation in IL-11R-expressing ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3) and/or abrogate cell death mediated by apoptosis-inducing agents using an ELISA assay that quantitates DNA fragmentation was also studied.
IL-11Ralpha was expressed in the malignant epithelial cells of 45 of 48 (93.8%) primary ovarian carcinoma samples studied. In 45 primary ovarian carcinoma samples where both components of the IL-11 receptor (IL-11Ralpha and gp130) were examined, coexpression was observed in 42 (93.3%). Expression of the IL-11 receptor components was also found in the stromal layer. Coexpression of IL-11Ralpha and gp130 was commonly observed in both benign ovarian tumors and in the epithelial layer of normal ovaries. In contrast, IL-11 mRNA was expressed in only 3 of 21 malignant samples studied (14.3%). Recombinant human IL-11 was unable either to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation or to block cell death effected by paclitaxel or Fas-activating antibodies in in vitro assays using OVCAR -3 or SKOV-3 cells.
The IL-11 receptor system is commonly expressed in both malignant and nonmalignant ovarian tissues, although its function in ovarian epithelial cell biology remains unclear.
3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX) was tested without exogenous activation in L5178Y/TK+/(-)-3.7.2C mouse lymphoma cells for mutation at the thymidine kinase locus and for clastogenicity. At a concentration of 0.75 micrograms/ml, the induced mutant frequency was 1027 per 10(6) survivors (survival = 11%). A concentration-related increase of large and small colony mutants was observed, but the majority of the MX induced mutants formed small colonies, consistent with the positive clastogenic response that was observed. MX primarily induced chromatid breaks and rearrangements (30 chromatid and 4 chromosome aberrations per 100 cells) at the 0.75 microgram/ml dose. These studies indicate that MX induces a broad spectrum of genetic damage.
Guanylin and uroguanylin link intestinal and renal electrolyte and water transport. Their function in intestine is well studied, but renal actions are less understood. Uroguanylin concentrations are increased in patients with chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, or those on dialysis. Guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) is the receptor first described for these peptides. In guanylate cyclase C-deficient mice guanylin- and uroguanylin-induced renal natriuresis, kaliuresis, and diuresis are retained.
Effects of guanylin and uroguanylin on principal cells of human cortical collecting ducts (CCD) isolated from kidneys after tumor nephrectomy were investigated. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), slow whole-cell patch-clamp, and microfluorimetric analysis of intracellular Ca(2+) were used. Here we present first functional measurements of isolated human CCD.
Principal cells of CCD were identified by the amiloride-induced hyperpolarization of principal cells (-3.8 +/- 0.3 mV) (N= 52). Cells depolarized upon guanylin or uroguanylin (each 10 nmol/L) by 3.3 +/- 0.8 mV (N= 12) and 3.4 +/- 0.5 mV (N= 18), respectively, but were hyperpolarized by 8Br-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (100 micromol/L) (-3.0 +/- 0.2 mV) (N= 4). mRNA for GC-C was not detected in CCD. Effects of both peptides were inhibited by Ba(2+) (1 mmol/L) or phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibition (AACOCF(3)) (5 micromol/L).
These findings suggest a new cGMP- and GC-C-independent but PLA(2)-dependent signaling pathway for these peptides in the kidney. Most likely guanylin and uroguanylin inhibit luminal K(+) channels of principal cells of human CCD via this pathway. This depolarization of principal cells consequently reduces the driving force of Na(+) and water reabsorption, explaining natriuresis and diuresis caused by these peptides.
Oxidative stress has been associated with multiple pathologies and disease states, including those involving the cardiovascular system. Previously, we showed that pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) undergo apoptosis after acute exposure to H(2)O(2). However, the underlying mechanisms regulating this process remain unclear. Because of the prevalence of H(2)O(2) in normal physiological processes and apparent loss of regulation in disease states, the purpose of this study was to develop a more complete understanding of H(2)O(2)-mediated adverse effects on endothelial cell survival. Acute exposure of PAECs to H(2)O(2) caused a dose-dependent increase in cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase and a significant increase in production of superoxide ions, which appear to be generated within the mitochondria, as well as a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activity. Subsequent to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, PAECs exhibited significant caspase activation and apoptotic nuclei. We also observed a significant increase in intracellular free Zn(2+) after bolus exposure to H(2)O(2). To determine whether this increase in Zn(2+) was involved in the apoptotic pathway induced by acute H(2)O(2) exposure, we developed an adenoviral construct for overexpression of the Zn(2+)-binding protein metallothionein-1. Our data indicate that chelating Zn(2+), either pharmacologically with N,N,N',N-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylene diamine or by overexpression of the Zn(2+)-binding protein metallothionein-1, in PAECs conferred significant protection from induction of apoptosis and cell death associated with the effects of acute H(2)O(2) exposure. Our results show that the acute toxicity profile of H(2)O(2) can be attributed, at least in part, to liberation of Zn(2+) within PAECs. We speculate that regulation of Zn(2+) levels may represent a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease associated with acute oxidative stress.
Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1a is caused by the deficiency of D-glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the key enzyme in glucose homeostasis. Despite both a high incidence and morbidity, the molecular mechanisms underlying this deficiency have eluded characterization. In the present study, the molecular and biochemical characterization of the human G6Pase complementary DNA, its gene, and the expressed protein, which is indistinguishable from human microsomal G6Pase, are reported. Several mutations in the G6Pase gene of affected individuals that completely inactivate the enzyme have been identified. These results establish the molecular basis of this disease and open the way for future gene therapy.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the etiology of indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal damage. This study investigated ascorbic acid (vitamin C)'s protective effects against oxidative gastric mucosal damage induced by indomethacin. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant because it can donate a hydrogen atom and form a relatively stable ascorbyl free radical. We have investigated alterations in the levels of myeloperoxidase, antioxidant system enzymes (glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase), lipid peroxidation and glutathione, as markers for ulceration process following oral administration of ascorbic acid, famotidine, lansoprazole, and ranitidine in rats with indomethacin-induced ulcers. In the present study, we found that (1) ascorbic acid, famotidine, lansoprazole and ranitidine reduced the development of indomethacin-induced gastric damages; (2) the administration of indomethacin caused a significant decrease in the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione, and an increase in the lipid peroxidation level; (3) the administration of ascorbic acid reversed the trend, inducing a significant increase of these enzymes' levels and a reduction in lipid peroxidation level in tissues; and (4) catalase, glutathione reductase and myeloperoxidase activities, increased by indomethacin, were found to be lower in the ascorbic acid, famotidine, lansoprazole and ranitidine-treated groups. The results indicate that the gastroprotective properties of ascorbic acid could be related to its positive effects on the antioxidant system and myeloperoxidase activity in indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers in rats.
Reactive oxygen radicals are probably involved in the pathogenesis of human and experimental models of renal disease, yet current methods are inadequate to quantify and identify the cells producing reactive oxygen radicals.
We used the nitroblue tetrazolium reaction to determine superoxide anion production in glomerular cells in phorbol myristate-stimulated glomerular suspensions and in isolated glomeruli from rats with nephrotoxic nephritis, ureteral obstruction, and puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. We were also able to identify these nitroblue tetrazolium + cells using specific appropriate antibodies. When the technique was tested in conditions known to increase reactive oxygen radicals, as phorbol myristate-stimulated glomeruli and glomeruli from animals with nephrotoxic nephritis and ureteral obstruction, increased number of nitroblue tetrazolium + cells were found. These cells were identified as glomerular intrinsic cells (Thy-1 +) or infiltrating leukocytes (leukocyte common antigen + or antineutrophil +).
This method may be useful to determine cells participating in glomerular damage induced by reactive oxygen radicals.
We report a solitary fibrous tumor in the nasal cavity of a 48-year-old woman who presented with a history of bilateral nasal obstruction and long-standing cocaine inhalation. Physical examination revealed a large mass involving the right nasal cavity and extending into the posterior aspect of the left nasal cavity. The computed tomography scan showed opacification of airways. During surgery, the mass was found to involve the entire nasal cavity, with extension to the right maxillary sinus, posterior nasal airways, and left nasal cavity. The mass was completely excised. Pathologic examination revealed a polypoid mass 3.7 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm. This tumor was composed of spindle cells that were cytologically bland in a background of ropey and nodular collagen, giving a "patternless" pattern. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells stained for CD34 and vimentin but not for S100 protein, keratin, desmin, HMB-45, and c-Kit. This immunohistochemical pattern confirmed the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor. Although solitary fibrous tumors are usually found in the pleura, they can occur in various other locations, such as the orbit, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, mediastinum, breast, vagina, meninges, and soft tissues. This case is of interest because the tumor occurred in a patient with prolonged cocaine inhalation. Such an association has not been previously described. The exact causal relationship between cocaine inhalation and the tumor is not known.
Zalcitabine is an antiretroviral nucleoside analogue that exhibits long-term toxicity to hepatocytes by interfering with the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Uridine antagonizes this effect in vitro. In the present study we investigate the mechanisms of zalcitabine-induced hepatotoxicity in mice and explore therapeutic outcomes with oral uridine supplementation. BalbC mice (7 weeks of age, 9 mice in each group) were fed 0.36 mg/kg/d of zalcitabine (corresponding to human dosing adapted for body surface), or 13 mg/kg/d of zalcitabine. Both zalcitabine groups were treated with or without Mitocnol (0.34 g/kg/d), a dietary supplement with high bioavailability of uridine. Liver histology and mitochondrial functions were assessed after 15 weeks. One mouse exposed to high dose zalcitabine died at 19 weeks of age. Zalcitabine induced a dose dependent microvesicular steatohepatitis with abundant mitochondria. The organelles were enlarged and contained disrupted cristae. Terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays showed frequent hepatocyte apoptosis. mtDNA was depleted in liver tissue, cytochrome c-oxidase but not succinate dehydrogenase activities were decreased, superoxide and malondialdehyde were elevated. The expression of COX I, an mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunit was reduced, whereas COX IV, a nucleus-encoded subunit was preserved. Uridine supplementation normalized or attenuated all toxic abnormalities in both zalcitabine groups, but had no effects when given without zalcitabine. Uridine supplementation was without apparent side effects.
Zalcitabine induces mtDNA-depletion in murine liver with consequent respiratory chain dysfunction, up-regulated synthesis of reactive oxygen species and microvesicular steatohepatitis. Uridine supplementation attenuates this mitochondrial hepatotoxicity without apparent intrinsic effects.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects approximately 2% of the European population. Antiviral therapy with pegInterferon-alpha (PegIFN) and ribavirin (Rbv) is the standard of care, leading to HCV eradication in roughly 50% of patients. IFN-based therapy has been associated with high rates (20%) of central nervous system side effects, but only a few case reports exist on extrapyramidal side effects.
We report a 64-year-old man developing parkinsonism during PegIFN alfa-2a and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C. No improvement was observed after treatment discontinuation. Therefore, on the basis of previous clinical and experimental reports, levodopa-benserazide treatment was started. After substantial improvement, symptoms relapsed following drug tapering.
This is the first case of parkinsonism in a Caucasian patient receiving PegIFN/Rbv therapy. The rapid and significant improvement of symptoms obtained in our patient with levodopa-benserazide, suggests that this therapy could be considered as first line symptomatic treatment.
In migraineurs nitroglycerin (NTG) induces severe delayed headache, resembling spontaneous migraine attacks. The aim of the present study was to evaluate NTG laser evoked potentials (LEP) features amplitude and pain sensation to laser stimuli during NTG-induced headache. Nine patients were selected. Headache was induced by oral administration of 0.6 mg of NTG; signals were recorded through disk electrodes placed at the vertex and referred to linked earlobes. CO(2)-LEPs delivered by stimulation of the dorsum of both hands and the right and left supraorbital zones were evaluated after the onset of moderate or severe headache resembling spontaneous migraine and at least 72 h after the end of the headache phase. Patients exhibited a significant heat pain threshold reduction and an LEPs amplitude increment during headache when both the supraorbital zones were stimulated. NTG appeared to support a reliable experimental model of migraine, based on the neuronal effects on the integrative-nociceptive structures. The LEPs facilitation during NTG-induced headache may be subtended by a hyperactivity of nociceptive cortex as well as by a failure of pain-inhibitory control.
In a double-blind crossover trial, (-)-deprenyl, a fast-acting selective monoamine-oxidase-B inhibitor without a "cheese effect", was given to 41 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who were receiving maximum tolerated doses of levodopa either alone or combined with carbidopa ("Sinemet"). In a dose of 10 mg, daily or on alternate days, (-)-deprenyl prolonged the therapeutic effect of levodopa and was effective in mild "on-off" disabilities with end-of-dose akinesia; the majority of patients with nocturnal and early-morning akinesia also improved. No statistically significant improvement occurred in diurnal akinesia, and there was no improvement in patients with severe on-off disabilities with freezing and rapid oscillations ("yo-yo" effect). Levodopa-induced dyskinesias were aggravated in 14 patients. In 5 previously untreated patients, (-)-deprenyl alone gave no benefit, but when it was used with levodopa and carbidopa a mean dosage reduction of 200 mg levodopa daily was possible. Depression, present in 15 patients, was unchanged. (-)-Deprenyl in combination with smaller total daily doses of levodopa and a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor may prove useful in reducing the frequency and severity of some types of on-off effect with overall benefit comparable to that obtained with larger doses of levodopa.
A 2-hour adrenocorticotrophic-hormone (A.C.T.H.) test was given to 23 children in their first attack of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, after treatment with prednisone according to the schedule of the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children. The length of the first remission was correlated with the response to the postmedication A.C.T.H. test. In 11 children this response was subnormal, and 10 of them had the first relapse within a year. Of the 7 children who stayed in remission for more than a year, 6 had normal responses. The treatment scheme should be adjusted to prevent postmedication adrenocortical suppression.
Azadirachta indica, used in antidiabetic herbal drugs, was reported to contain α-glucosidase inhibitor. Bioassay guided purification characterized the inhibitor as nimbidiol (a diterpenoid), present in root and stem-bark of the tree. Nimbidiol inhibited intestinal (mammalian) maltase-glucoamylase, sucrase-isomaltase, lactase, trehalase and fungal α-glucosidases. Nimbidiol showed a mixed competitive inhibition on intestinal carbohydrases. IC50, Ki and Ki' (µM) were 1.35 ± 0.12, 0.08 ± 0.01, 0.25 ± 0.11, respectively, for maltase-glucoamylase (maltotetraose as substrate). Nimbidiol was more potent inhibitor of isomaltase (IC50 0.85 ± 0.035 µM), lactase (IC50 20 ± 1.33 µM) and trehalase (IC50 30 ± 1.75 µM) than acarbose, voglibose, salacinol, kotalanol and mangiferin. Ki and Ki' values (µM) for intestinal sucrase were 0.7 ± 0.12 and 1.44 ± 0.65, respectively. Development of nimbidiol as an antidiabetic drug appears to be promising because of broad inhibition spectrum of intestinal glucosidases and easy synthesis of the molecule.
The present study was designed to observe the expressions of bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) and inhibitory Smads in kidney of rats with diabetic nephropathy (DN), and explore the possible mechanism of DN. Male Wistar rats weighing 180-220 g were single injected with streptozocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg body weight) for 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks to induce DN. Blood glucose, kidney weight/body weight and 24-hour urine protein in the control and DN rats were examined; the expressions of BMP-7, Smad6 and Smad7 were detected by using immunohistochemical techniques, Western blot and real-time PCR. The results showed that blood glucose and 24-hour urine protein in DN rats were higher than that in the control rats and kidney weight/body weight was also elevated in DN rats, especially in 16-week STZ-induced rats. The expressions of BMP-7 and Smad6 proteins in DN rats were elevated, while BMP-7 mRNA expression was increased 2 weeks after STZ injection and decreased 16 weeks after STZ injection. The expressions of Smad7 protein and mRNA were elevated in DN rats 2 weeks after STZ injection and decreased 16 weeks after STZ injection. In addition, the expressions of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and collagen type I (COL-I) mRNA were increased in DN rats. These results suggest in the early stage of DN, increase in BMP-7 and inhibitory Smad expression may play a role in the feedback regulation and restrain the development of DN.
