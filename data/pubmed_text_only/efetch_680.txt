The methotrexate (MTX) rescue agent carboxypeptidase G2 (CPDG2) rapidly hydrolyses MTX to the inactive metabolite DAMPA (4-[[2,4-diamino-6-(pteridinyl)methyl]-methylamino]-benzoic acid) and glutamate in patients with MTX-induced renal failure and delayed MTX excretion. DAMPA is thought to be an inactive metabolite of MTX because it is not an effective inhibitor of the MTX target enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. DAMPA is eliminated more rapidly than MTX in these patients, which suggests a nonrenal route of elimination. In a phase II study (May 1997-March 2002), CPDG2 was administered intravenously to 82 patients at a median dose of 50 U kg(-1) (range 33-60 U kg(-1)). Eligible patients for this study had serum MTX concentrations of >10 microM at 36 h or >5 microM at 42 h after start of MTX infusion and documented renal failure (serum creatinine > or =1.5 times the upper limit of normal). Immediately before CPDG2 administration, a median MTX serum level of 11.93 microM (range 0.52-901 microM) was documented. Carboxypeptidase G2 was given at a median of 52 h (range 25-178 h) following the start of an MTX infusion of 1-12 g m(-2) 4-36 h(-1) and resulted in a rapid 97% (range 73-99%) reduction of the MTX serum level. Toxicity related to CPDG2 was not observed. Toxicity related to MTX was documented in about half the patients; four patients died despite CPDG2 administration due to severe myelosuppression and septic complications. In conclusion, administration of CPDG2 is a well-tolerated, safe and a very effective way of MTX elimination in delayed excretion due to renal failure.
Three patients were investigated due to neurological symptoms induced by amiodarone used to treat refractory cardiac arrhythmia. Chronic polineuritis was found in two and dyskinesia in one. The light and electromicroscopical studies (cases 1 and 2) of a N. Suralis (neuropathic cases) display a loss of large myelinated fibers and marked reduced unmyelinated axons associated with osmiophilic inclusions in Schwann cells and endothelial venulae. The EEG was abnormal in the case of dyskinesia (n.3). The interruption of amiodarone improved the neurological symptoms.
beta 0-Thalassemia is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with absence of beta-globin. In a survey of DNAs from patients with beta 0-thalassemia of diverse ethnic origins, a change at the splice junction at the 5' end of the large intervening sequence (IVS 2) of the human beta-globin gene has been found in one patient of Italian and another two of Iranian ethnic origins. The enzyme Hph I recognizes a change at this site and generates a large-than-normal fragment of DNA, which hybridizes specifically to a beta-globin IVS 2 probe. No other changes in beta-globin gene DNA structure or organization are detectable by extensive restriction endonuclease analysis. The enzyme HinfI which recognizes a sequence beginning three nucleotides from the 5' end of the IVS 2 splice junction, produces normal fragments and localizes the defect to a G-G-T sequence at the 5'-end IVS 2 splice junction. This sequence is known to be remarkably conserved in all globin genes from many species and in most other genes examined to date. Thus, in at least some beta 0-thalassemia patients, the beta 0-thalassemia defect is associated with a nucleotide change at a splice junction. These patients provide unique examples of naturally occurring defects in splice junctions of eukaryotic genes associated with absence of specific gene function.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy status. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy using the known AMPK activators resveratrol and AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside) in a mouse model.
C57BL/6 mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated with resveratrol orally at 50 mg/kg for 7 days or with AICAR intraperitoneally at 100 mg/kg 24 hours before death. Retinal protein levels of phosphorylated and total AMPK, phosphorylated nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were evaluated by Western blot analysis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Retinal activity of sirtuin (SIRT)1 was measured by deacetylase fluorometric assay. Leukocyte adhesion to the retinal vasculature was examined with a concanavalin A lectin perfusion-labeling technique.
Induction of diabetes in mice led to retinal AMPK dephosphorylation, which was significantly reversed by either resveratrol or AICAR. Either resveratrol or AICAR significantly reversed SIRT1 deactivation and NF-κB phosphorylation, both of which were induced in the diabetic retina. Administration of resveratrol to diabetic mice significantly reduced diabetes-induced retinal leukocyte adhesion, together with retinal expression of ICAM-1 and VEGF.
The present findings reveal that diabetes-induced retinal inflammation stems from downregulation of the AMPK pathway, leading subsequently to SIRT1 deactivation and NF-κB activation. The data also suggest the potential use of the AMPK activator resveratrol as a therapeutic agent for diabetic retinopathy.
Dopaminergic agents and carbidopa/levodopa have become the preferred treatment for both the restless legs (RL) syndrome and for periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). For once-nightly treatments with carbidopa/ levodopa, a problem with morning end-of-dose rebound increases in leg movements has been reported to occur in the about one-fourth of the patients. In our clinical studies a previously unreported but far more significant problem of markedly augmented RL symptoms occurred in the afternoon and the evening prior to taking the next nightly dose. A systematic prospective evaluation of this augmentation in 46 consecutive patients treated with carbidopa/ levodopa for RL syndrome or PLMS disorder found this augmentation to be the major adverse effect of treatment. Augmentation occurred for 31% of PLMS patients and 82% of all RL patients. It was greater for subjects with more severe RL symptoms and for patients on higher doses (> or = 50/200 mg carbidopa/levodopa) but was unrelated to gender, age or baseline severity of PLMS. This augmentation was severe enough to require medication change for 50% of the RL patients and 13% of PLMS patients. Augmentation resolved with cessation of the medication and could be minimized by keeping the dose low.
Methadone used for opioid dependence therapy is associated with increased pain sensitivity. This study aimed to investigate whether methadone administration lowers nociceptive threshold in adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and if this threshold could be altered by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Rats were implanted with osmotic pumps delivering 1mg/kg/day methadone (n=6), or saline placebo (n=6) (0.51 microl/h). A separate cohort of rats received either methadone 1mg/kg/day (n=8) or methadone 1mg/kg/day with 20mg/kg/day memantine (n=8). Nociception was measured by the Hargreave's paw withdrawal test. Baseline nociception was measured on day 0 prior to osmotic pump implantation and was measured daily for the following 21 days. Osmotic pumps were removed following nociceptive testing on day 14. Methadone only treated rats had a mean paw withdrawal latency significantly lower than the corresponding values for saline on days 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 17 (P<0.05). At all other time points the mean paw withdrawal latency was not significantly different from saline (P>0.05). Paw withdrawal latency of rats treated with methadone co-administered with memantine did not differ significantly compared to methadone only (P>0.05). This demonstrates that methadone induces hyperalgesia in the SD rat yet this hyperalgesia resolves following discontinuation of methadone administration. Furthermore, memantine does not alter the development of methadone-induced hyperalgesia.
Micropuncture studies of the distal nephron and measurements of Na,K-ATPase activity in microdissected collecting tubules have suggested that renal retention of sodium in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrotic rats originates in the collecting duct. The present study demonstrated this hypothesis by in vitro microperfusion and showed that amiloride was able to restore sodium balance. Indeed, isolated perfused cortical collecting ducts from PAN-treated rats exhibited an abnormally high transepithelial sodium reabsorption that was abolished by amiloride, and in vivo administration of amiloride fully prevented decreased urinary sodium excretion and positive sodium balance in nephrotic rats. As expected from the aldosterone independence of Na(+) retention in PAN nephrotic rats, blockade of aldosterone receptor by potassium canrenoate did not alter urinary Na(+) excretion, Na(+) balance, or ascites formation in PAN nephrotic rats.
The combination of interstitial nephritis and minimal-change nephrotic syndrome has been well described in adults receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. The association of interstitial nephritis and minimal-change nephrotic syndrome has recently been described in 1 adult patient receiving ampicillin and in 1 patient receiving rifampin. We describe an 8-month-old child who developed reversible interstitial nephritis and minimal-change nephrotic syndrome while taking antibiotics.
In a three-year follow-up study of 69 patients found that erectile dysfunction (ED) impairs many elderly men's life: up to 25% of the men aged 65 y and 80% of those aged 75 y suffer from erectile dysfunction. The most effective non-surgical treatment of ED is intracavernosal pharmacotherapy, and the most common vasoactive agent currently used is prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcome of PGE1 treatment and the patients' overall satisfaction with their sexual life. Sixty-nine patients who had started ICI therapy three years earlier were invited to a control examination. The mean age of the patients was 60.5 y. The patients filled in a questionnaire, which included questions about the use of PGE1 treatment at home. All the patients evaluated their own satisfaction with their erection, ejaculation, orgasm and libido on a visual analytical scale (VAS, 0-100%). A clinical examination was made, and the penile shaft was examined by ultrasonography. Erection with the home dose of PGE1 was estimated by Rigiscan, and the degree of erection was also estimated clinically (grades 0-5) by a doctor. The most common doses of PGE1 used at home were between 10 and 20 m (58%), 46.4% of the patients had discontinued PGE1 therapy, the mean time of using PGE1 was 23.3 months. The mean coital frequency with PGE1 was 2.8 times per month. 34.8% of the patients (24 out of 69) reported that their own spontaneous erections had improved after the beginning of PGE1 therapy. The most common problem was hematomas in 10.1% of the patients (7 out of 69), which, however, were small and did not cause discontinuation of the therapy. There were three instances of priapism (4.3%), and four patients (5.8%) had fibrosis in ultrasonography. The patients' satisfaction with their erection at home was 67.3% with PGE1. The mean coital frequency with PGE1 therapy was quite low, 2.8 times per month, even though the patients' mean age was only 60.5 y, one reason may be the high price of PGE1 injections. The rate of improvement of spontaneous erections while using PGE1 was quite high, accounting for 34.8% of the patients. Most of the patients who discontinued the PGE1 therapy had a psychogenic etiology. There were no systemic side-effects with PGE1. Only 7.2% of the patients had prolonged pain after the injection, leading to drug discontinuation. It can be concluded that treatment with intracavernous injections of PGE1 is well tolerated and involves only minor problems. The patients' satisfaction with their erections at home with PGE1 therapy was good. Precise determination of the home dose of PGE1 and the teaching of the technique of injection are important at the beginning of this treatment modality.
Reactivation of chronic hepatitis B in HBsAg carriers is a well known complication of chemo?therapy. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic hepatitis to fatal hepatic failure. Although it impairs the prognosis of cancer treatment, it may be overlooked due to other possible causes of liver damage.
The patient presented with acute liver failure after 6 cycles of rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide for low grade non-hodgkin's lymphoma. Differential diagnoses were chemotherapy-induced liver failure, autoimmune hepatitis, phenprocoumon-induced liver failure and infiltration of the liver by lymphoma. Finally, reactivation of hepatitis B with a fibrosing cholestatic pattern was identified.
This case reminds clinicians that patients receiving high-intensive chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should be screened for HBsAg. HbsAg positive patients should obtain prophylactic antiviral therapy with lamivudine or another substance active against HBV.
To account for severity of disease in patients with erectile dysfunction, we introduced a progressive treatment technique using four protocols of drug injections. The study group consisted of 452 men aged 26-85 gamma with erectile dysfunction. Protocol I. All patients began with a combination of papaverine and Regitine in doses adjusted to the estimated severity of dysfunction and to age, up to a maximum dose of 25 mg papaverine and 1.5 mg of Regitine. Protocol II. Patients who could not achieve sufficient rigidity on protocol I were switched to prostin VR, to a maximum of 25 mcg. Protocol III. Patients who failed protocol II received papaverine, Regitine and prostin VR. Protocol IV. Patients who failed protocol III received atropine sulfate (0.02-0.06 mg) in addition to papaverine, Regitine and prostin. Sufficient rigidity was achieved as follows: Protocol I=305 (67.4%) of the original cohort; Protocol II= 61 of the 147 failures with Protocol I (41.5%); Protocol III = 55 of the 86 failures with Protocol 11 (63.9%); Protocol IV = 20 of the remaining 31 patients (64.5%). Overall, sustained rigidity was achieved in 441 of the 452 patients (97.5%). Eleven patients (2.5%) failed all four protocols and were offered a penile prosthesis. Therefore, using our progressive method, by starting with the most available and inexpensive drugs, patients with erectile dysfunction can be given optimal treatment according to the severity of their disease. The success rate is high while costs are kept to a minimum.
Our previous demonstration of an antimetastatic effect of lovastatin, both in rat sarcoma and lymphoma tumor-models, as well as the fact that lovastatin and radiation are able to stop the cell cycle in different phases, suggested the feasibility of a combined treatment. We studied the effect of the in vitro combined treatment of a B-cell rat lymphoma (L-TACB) with lovastatin and irradiation. The results herein obtained provide new information about the role of statins as radiosensitizers. The antitumor effect of the combined treatment was higher than that elicited by either treatment alone. This effect could be a consequence, at least in part, of an enhanced apoptosis.
This study evaluated the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, an inhibitor of transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), in the treatment of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo.
In vitro, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed to evaluate the effect of parthenolide on growth inhibition and chemosensitization to antitumor drugs of three gastric cancer cell lines (MKN-28, MKN-45 and MKN-74). Microarray analysis was performed to identify genes which were up- or down-regulated on the treatment of parthenolide. The isobologram analysis was introduced to evaluate the synergic effect of parthenolide on antitumor drugs. In vivo, the effect of parthenolide was investigated in a mouse peritoneal dissemination model with and without chemotherapy.
Parthenolide significantly inhibited cell growth in three gastric cancer cell lines. The phosphorylation of NF-κB was down-regulated by the treatment of parthenolide. The synergic effect of parthenolide was confirmed in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin. In the peritoneal dissemination model, parthenolide significantly suppressed the disseminated nodules as a single agent and also enhanced chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. Furthermore, the combined therapy of parthenolide and paclitaxel significantly contributed to prolonging the survival duration.
The NF-κB inhibitor, parthenolide, may enhance chemosensitivity to paclitaxel in the treatment of patients with gastric cancer.
Intracranial hemorrhage is an uncommon complication of phenylpropanolamine. There is an increasing awareness of this complication in the West. However, to the best of our knowledge there have been no cases reported from India. Here we report a patient who developed Intraventricular hemorrhage following ingestion of Phenylpropanolamine, from which he made an uneventul recovery over the next two weeks.
Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but torcetrapib, the first-in-class inhibitor tested in a large outcome trial, caused an unexpected blood pressure elevation and increased cardiovascular events. Whether the hypertensive effect resulted from CETP inhibition or an off-target action of torcetrapib has been debated. We hypothesized that common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CETP gene could help distinguish mechanism-based from off-target actions of CETP inhibitors to inform on the validity of CETP as a therapeutic target.
We compared the effect of CETP single-nucleotide polymorphisms and torcetrapib treatment on lipid fractions, blood pressure, and electrolytes in up to 67 687 individuals from genetic studies and 17 911 from randomized trials. CETP single-nucleotide polymorphisms and torcetrapib treatment reduced CETP activity and had a directionally concordant effect on 8 lipid and lipoprotein traits (total, low-density lipoprotein, and HDL cholesterol; HDL2; HDL3; apolipoproteins A-I and B; and triglycerides), with the genetic effect on HDL cholesterol (0.13 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11 to 0.14 mmol/L) being consistent with that expected of a 10-mg dose of torcetrapib (0.13 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.15). In trials, 60 mg of torcetrapib elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 4.47 mm Hg (95% CI 4.10 to 4.84 mm Hg) and 2.08 mm Hg (95% CI 1.84 to 2.31 mm Hg), respectively. However, the effect of CETP single-nucleotide polymorphisms on systolic blood pressure (0.16 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.60 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (-0.04 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.28 mm Hg) was null and significantly different from that expected of 10 mg of torcetrapib.
Discordance in the effects of CETP single-nucleotide polymorphisms and torcetrapib treatment on blood pressure despite the concordant effects on lipids indicates the hypertensive action of torcetrapib is unlikely to be due to CETP inhibition or shared by chemically dissimilar CETP inhibitors. Genetic studies could find a place in drug-development programs as a new source of randomized evidence for drug-target validation in humans.
The sequential doxorubicin --> CMF (CMF=cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) regimen has never been compared to CMF in a randomised trial. The role of adding goserelin and tamoxifen after chemotherapy is unclear. In all, 466 premenopausal node-positive patients were randomised to: (a) CMF x 6 cycles (CMF); (b) doxorubicin x 4 cycles followed by CMF x 6 cycles (A --> CMF); (c) CMF x 6 cycles followed by goserelin plus tamoxifen x 2 years (CMF --> GT); and (d) doxorubicin x 4 cycles followed by CMF x 6 cycles followed by goserelin plus tamoxifen x 2 years (A --> CMF --> GT). The study used a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design to assess: (1) the effect of the chemotherapy regimens (CMF vs A --> CMF or arms a+c vs b+d) and (2) the effect of adding GT after chemotherapy (arms a+b vs c+d). At a median follow-up of 72 months, A --> CMF as compared to CMF significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) with a multivariate hazard ratio (HR)=0.740 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.556-0.986; P=0.040) and produced a nonsignificant improvement of overall survival (OS) (HR=0.764; 95% CI: 0.489-1.193). The addition of GT after chemotherapy significantly improved DFS (HR=0.74; 95% CI: 0.555-0.987; P=0.040), with a nonsignificant improvement of OS (HR=0.84; 95% CI: 0.54-1.32). A --> CMF is superior to CMF. Adding GT after chemotherapy is beneficial for premenopausal node-positive patients.
We present a case showing that intake of amphetamine can cause severe anterior myocardial infarction with acute severe pump failure. Acute angiography revealed massive proximal thrombotic occlusion of the LAD, the first diagonal branch and septal branches in a 28-year-old man. Thrombectomy, balloon dilation and stenting were performed. Spasm thrombus interplay was found to be the likely mechanism. Due to the massive infarction, extremely depressed left ventricular performance and hemodynamic instability, the patient underwent successful heart transplantation. The patient was readmitted to hospital six months later due to chronic vascular rejection of the heart, which lead to the death of the young man.
Only 10% of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) have normal coronary arteriograms. It is well known that cocaine and amphetamines may induce myocardial infarction and stroke. A 24-year-old male was admitted after intake of a so-called amphetamine bomb. He had no chest pain. NSTEMI was confirmed by ECG and troponin-T outflow. The coronary arteriogram on day 6 was normal. It is suggested that all patients, even young persons, who are admitted for amphetamine intoxication should be evaluated for acute coronary syndrome, independent of chest pain status.
Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disorder which is characterized by reversible airway obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. Oxidative stress has been shown to be strongly associated with most of the features of asthma and leads to accumulation of phosphatidyl inositol (3,4) bis-phosphate {PtdIns(3,4)P2} which is the major substrate for inositol polyphosphate 4 phosphatase (INPP4A). PtdIns(3,4)P2 in turn activates PI3K pathway and contributes to oxidative stress. Thus, there exists a vicious loop between oxidative stress and lipid phosphatase signaling. In this context, we have recently shown that INPP4A, a crucial molecular checkpoint in controlling PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, is downregulated in allergic airway inflammation. Resveratrol, a potent antioxidant found in red wines, has been shown to attenuate asthma features in murine model of allergic airway inflammation (AAI), however the underlying mode of its action was not completely understood. In this study, the effect of resveratrol on mitochondrial dysfunction, PI3K-Akt signaling and inositol polyphosphate 4 phosphatase was studied in murine model of allergic airway inflammation. We observed that resveratrol treatment of allergic mice was found to significantly downregulate oxidative stress and restore mitochondrial function. It also decreased calpain activity and restored the expression of INPP4A in lungs which in turn reduced Akt kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation. These results suggest a novel mechanism of action of resveratrol in attenuating asthma phenotype by downregulating PI3K-Akt pathway via upregulating INPP4A.
We report the case of a 42-year-old man who developed biopsy-confirmed acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) after cocaine sniffing. He required a few hemodialysis sessions but fully recovered within 3 weeks after cocaine withdrawal and a short course of corticosteroids. AIN should be recognized as a potential cause of acute renal failure in cocaine users, and a history of cocaine use should be carefully elicited in patients with unexplained AIN.
Many etiologies lead to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), amongst which are antineoplastic chemotherapies. Gemcitabine, a nucleoside analogue, has been approved for the treatment ofbladder and advanced non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). The reported incidence of gemcitabine-associated TMA in the literature is low, ranging from 0.015-0.31%.
Herein, we describe the first reported case of gemcitabine-induced TMA in a renal transplant patient. This occurred in a 54-year-old male transplant recipient undergoing sirolimus-based immunosuppression. In February 2005, he was diagnosed to have NSCLC, for which he received dual chemotherapy, including carboplatin and gemcitabine. After the third cycle he developed TMA.
On admission, he presented with weakness, edema, normal blood pressure, leucopenia (2440/mm3), thrombopenia (11,000/mm3), hemolytic anemia with hemoglobin at 8 g/dl, schistocytes between 18-33% per hundred, increase in lactate dehydrogenase at 600 IU/l (N <380), and decreased haptoglobin at 0.29 g/l. Renal function was stable: serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dl, albuminemia 30 g/l, proteinuria was present at 3 g/l in association with microscopic hematuria, and sirolimus trough level was 6.4 ng/ml. Treatment included infusions of fresh frozen plasma, withdrawal of sirolimus, which was replaced by mycophenolate mofetil, and suspension of chemotherapy. He fully recovered from TMA within 4 weeks. The concomitant use of sirolimus, which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor, plus gemcitabine may have resulted in TMA.
We report on a psychosis caused by application of a transdermal scopolamine patch for over 15 days. In the literature there is no mention of a case in which scopolamine had such an influence nor are any cases reported in which paranoid-hallucinatory symptoms continued 11 days after removing the patch.
Burning pain was induced in healthy human subjects by intracutaneous injections of capsaicin (20 microl, 0.1%) in the innervation territory of the cutaneous branch of the peroneal nerve and the pain responses were compared with the activation patterns of afferent C-fibres recorded by microneurography. Responsiveness of single units to mechanical or heat stimuli or to sympathetic reflex provocation tests was determined by transient slowing of conduction velocity following activation (marking technique). Capsaicin activated each of 12 mechano-responsive and 17 of 20 mechano-insensitive C-units. However, the duration of the responses to capsaicin was significantly longer in mechano-insensitive C-units (median 170 s; quartiles 80-390) compared with mechano-responsive C-units (8 s; 4-10). The activation times of mechano-insensitive C-units closely matched the duration of capsaicin-induced pain responses, whereas activation of mechano-responsive C-units was too short to account for the duration of the burning pain. The latter generally were desensitized to mechanical stimulation at the injection site, whereas 8 of 17 of the originally mechano-insensitive C-units became responsive to mechanical probing at the injection site after capsaicin. Responses typically started several seconds after the onset of the mechanical stimulus in parallel with pain sensations. We did not observe sensitization to brushing or to punctate stimuli in uninjured parts of the innervation territory. Differential capsaicin sensitivity adds to the cumulating evidence for the existence of two categories of functionally different nociceptors in human skin, with a special role for mechano-insensitive fibres in sensitization and hyperalgesia. Possible structural differences between these two categories are discussed, including the role of tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels.
Moderate consumption of natural dietary polyphenolic compounds can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Here we investigated the protective effects of delphinidin against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The MTT assay showed that 2h pre-incubation with delphinidin markedly restored the oxLDL-induced viability loss in HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was accompanied by a significant decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species. Moreover, delphinidin imposed preventive effects on suppressing the production of lipid peroxidation, restoring the activities of endogenous antioxidants, and increasing the level of nitric oxide. Pre-incubation of delphinidin with HUVECs led to the reduction of apoptosis. Finally, delphinidin can efficiently prevent the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein and up-regulation of Bax protein. Together, our findings suggest that delphinidin can effectively protect HUVECs against oxidative stress induced by oxLDL, which may be important for preventing both plaque development and stability in atherosclerosis.
