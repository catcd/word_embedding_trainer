1. The nitric oxide (NO) system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various forms of experimental hypertension. We studied nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity as a possible indicator of NO production in adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH)-induced hypertension in the rat. 2. Haemodynamic, metabolic and biochemical parameters were examined in sham (saline)- and ACTH (100 microg/kg per day)-treated male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 20). 3. Adrenocorticotrophin treatment increased systolic blood pressure, serum corticosterone, adrenal NOS activity and adrenal nitrate and nitrite concentrations and decreased bodyweight and plasma nitrate/nitrite. 4. Previous observations of diminished NO production in ACTH- and corticosterone-induced hypertension in the rat were confirmed, but could not be explained by reduced NOS activity in the present study.
The chlorinated impurities of 1-methylcyclopropene possess weak mutagenicity and are carcinogenic in rodent bioassays. Dose-response modelling of the data for 1-chloro-2-methylpropene gave a BMDL10 for nasal carcinomas in male rats of 11 mg/kg-bw/day (after correction for the 5 days/week dosage schedule). No human exposure data are available and theoretical estimates had to be used to calculate the MoE. The MoEs ranged from 40,000 to 100,000,000 depending on the assumptions used in the exposure estimation.
Ginkgo biloba has been used for many thousand years as a traditional herbal remedy and its extract has been consumed for many decades as a dietary supplement. Ginkgo biloba leaf extract is a complex mixture with many constituents, including flavonol glycosides and terpene lactones. The National Toxicology Program 2-year cancer bioassay found that G. biloba leaf extract targets the liver, thyroid gland, and nose of rodents; however, the mechanism of G. biloba leaf extract-associated carcinogenicity remains unclear. In the current study, the in vitro genotoxicity of G. biloba leaf extract and its eight constituents was evaluated using the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) and Comet assay. The underlying mechanisms of G. biloba leaf extract-associated genotoxicity were explored. Ginkgo biloba leaf extract, quercetin, and kaempferol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the mutant frequency and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Western blot analysis confirmed that G. biloba leaf extract, quercetin, and kaempferol activated the DNA damage signaling pathway with increased expression of γ-H2AX and phosphorylated Chk2 and Chk1. In addition, G. biloba leaf extract produced reactive oxygen species and decreased glutathione levels in L5178Y cells. Loss of heterozygosity analysis of mutants indicated that G. biloba leaf extract, quercetin, and kaempferol treatments resulted in extensive chromosomal damage. These results indicate that G. biloba leaf extract and its two constituents, quercetin and kaempferol, are mutagenic to the mouse L5178Y cells and induce DSBs. Quercetin and kaempferol likely are major contributors to G. biloba leaf extract-induced genotoxicity.
The mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is an iron-sulfur flavoenzyme linking the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mutations in the human SDHB, SDHC and SDHD genes are responsible for the development of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma, tumors of the head and neck or the adrenal medulla, respectively. In recent years, SDH has become recognized as a source of reactive oxygen species, which may contribute to tumorigenesis. We have developed a Caenorhabditis elegans model to investigate the molecular and catalytic effects of mutations in the sdhb-1 gene, which encodes the SDH iron-sulfur subunit. We created mutations in Pro211; this residue is located near the site of ubiquinone reduction and is conserved in human SDHB (Pro197), where it is associated with tumorigenesis. Mutant phenotypes ranged from relatively benign to lethal and were characterized by hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, a shortened life span, impaired respiration and overproduction of superoxide. Our data suggest that the SDH ubiquinone-binding site can become a source of superoxide and that the pathological consequences of SDH mutations can be mitigated with antioxidants, such as ascorbate and N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Our work leads to a better understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in respiratory chain mutations and of the mechanisms of aging and tumorigenesis.
To document the effectiveness and vicissitudes of treating 14 bipolar patients with lithium carbonate over a combined 300 years, and an average of 21 years/patient.
Chart review of the narrative and laboratory studies of these 14 patients ranging in duration from 12 to 29 years.
Lithium stabilized these bipolar patients over these periods. Only three patients required hospitalization, one because lithium was slowly tapered at her request after 6 years of mood stability, another because of non-compliance, and a third because of co-morbid alcohol abuse. One patient attempted suicide after lithium was tapered off. However, in some patients, there were serious side-effects necessitating lithium discontinuation.
Controlled studies in psychopharmacology are obviously preferred to open-label or naturalistic case studies. However, controlled studies are rarely conducted over long periods, and practice-related naturalistic research can be of value, albeit anecdotal and without the use of structured rating scales. In this paper, we are reporting on 14 patients seen consistently by one psychiatrist. These patients were functional and productive at work and in family life. The patients suffered brief hypomanic or depressive episodes. Although several patients experienced serious side-effects, lithium was continued with stable mood, while the side-effects were managed in collaboration with other specialists.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a demyelinating polyneuropathy of probable autoimmune pathogenesis characterized by rapidly progressive symmetric paralysis. In the literature some cases of GBS associated with anticancer chemotherapy are reported. We present a case of a 55-year old woman who complained of progressive motor deficit in four limbs, areflexia in lower limbs and facial nerve paralysis one week after beginning cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy for metastatic lung cancer. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a strong positive Pandy reaction with 435 mg/dl total protein. The electromyography and the electroneuronography established the diagnosis of inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Specific therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin 25 g/day in 5 administrations for 5 days was started with complete benefit.
To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive bupropion sustained-release (SR) on male sexual dysfunction (SD) induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as SD is a common side-effect of SSRIs and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined.
The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of SSRI. The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR (150 mg twice daily, 117) or placebo (twice daily, 117) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF; the primary outcome measure), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) (secondary outcome measures). Participants were followed biweekly during study period.
After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean (sd) scores for CGI-SF were significantly lower, i.e. better, in patients on bupropion SR, at 2.4 (1.2), than in the placebo group, at 3.9 (1.1) (P= 0.01). Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score (54.4% vs 1.2%; P= 0.003), and in the five different domains of the IIEF. Total ASEX scores were significantly lower, i.e. better, among men who received bupropion than placebo, at 15.5 (4.3) vs 21.5 (4.7) (P= 0.002). The EDITS scores were 67.4 (10.2) for the bupropion and 36.3 (11.7) for the placebo group (P= 0.001). The ASEX score and CGI-SF score were correlated (P= 0.003). In linear regression analyses the CGI-SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD, type of SSRI used and age.
Bupropion is an effective treatment for male SD induced by SSRIs. These results provide empirical support for conducting a further study of bupropion.
The efficacy and optimum dose of beta-blockers have not been established in Japanese patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The efficacy and safety of two doses of carvedilol, a beta-blocker with vasodilator and antioxidant actions, were investigated in Japanese patients with CHF.
After screening and a carvedilol challenge phase, 174 patients with mild to moderate CHF were randomly assigned (double-blinded) to placebo, 2.5 mg of carvedilol twice daily, or 10 mg of carvedilol twice daily. After a 2- to 4-week uptitration phase, maintenance treatment was continued for 24 to 48 weeks. The primary end point was improvement of the global assessment of CHF by the attending physician. Secondary end points were death or hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular hospitalization, hospitalization for heart failure, change of left ventricular ejection fraction, and change in New York Heart Association class.
Carvedilol therapy achieved dose-dependent improvement of all end points (P for linear trend, range.002 to <.001). Both carvedilol groups showed marked risk reduction (71% to 91%) for cardiovascular and CHF hospitalization and for death or cardiovascular hospitalization (P range,.024 to <.001 for pairwise comparisons with placebo). No significant differences were observed for noncardiovascular hospitalization or adverse events.
In Japanese patients with mild or moderate CHF, carvedilol achieved dose-related improvement of CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction; cardiovascular hospitalization was markedly reduced. At 5 mg/d, carvedilol conferred an important patient benefit, less than at 20 mg/d.
The popular over-the counter analgesic drug diclofenac has recently been associated with increased rates of myocardial infarction among patients with cardiovascular risk as well as among healthy populations. Although other traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAID) have also been accused to exert this risk, literature data at present gives reason to believe that the hazard of myocardial infarction is mainly associated with diclofenac. Large retrospective analyses of clinical data have repeatedly shown that diclofenac, similar as some selective COX-2 inhibitors, increases the propensity to experience adverse cardiovascular and atherothrombotic events. These associations cannot be explained with the deteriorating effect of NSAID on arterial hypertension, as the statistical associations only have been found conclusively for diclofenac and not for other tNSAID. The reasons for this novel side-effect of diclofenac may be based on the specific pharmacology of diclofenac, which, similar to selective COX-2 inhibitors, alters vascular levels of platelet active prostaglandins in a way that favours arterial thrombosis. In this review, we summarize the clinical evidence about adverse atherothrombotic events associated with diclofenac and dissect the pharmacological reasons beyond this phenomenon in comparison to other tNSAID.
Patients who present with acute neuropsychiatric syndromes pose difficult diagnostic and treatment challenges. A history of psychiatric illness and treatment with psychotropic medication may be valuable clues to diagnosis and management of such patients. However, this information may also tempt a clinician to focus on a premature diagnosis, excluding other important possibilities. A case of a 42-year-old male with recurrent psychotic illness who developed an abrupt deterioration in mental and physical status is presented. Despite an initial good response to physostigmine, he was diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome and did not receive subsequent treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors. The patient expired within hours of arriving in the emergency room. The postmortem benztropine level was elevated, leading to the attribution of death to anticholinergic toxicity. This case serves to illustrate the difficulties in distinguishing features of anticholinergic toxicity and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Resistance to tamoxifen treatment occurs in approximately 50% of the estrogen receptor (ER)alpha-positive breast cancer patients. Resistant patients would benefit from treatment with other available antiestrogens. Arzoxifene is an effective growth inhibitor of ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells, including tamoxifen-resistant tumors. In this study, we show that overexpression of a regular component of the ERalpha transcription factor complex, cyclin D1, which occurs in approximately 40% of breast cancer patients, renders cells resistant to the new promising antiestrogen, arzoxifene. Overexpression of cyclin D1 alters the conformation of ERalpha in the presence of arzoxifene. In this altered conformation, ERalpha still recruits RNA polymerase II to an estrogen response element-containing promoter, inducing transcription of an ERalpha-dependent reporter gene and of endogenous pS2, and promoting arzoxifene-stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells. Arzoxifene is then converted from an ERalpha antagonist into an agonist. This can be explained by a stabilization of the ERalpha/steroid receptor coactivator-1 complex in the presence of arzoxifene, only when cyclin D1 is overexpressed. These results indicate that subtle changes in the conformation of ERalpha upon binding to antiestrogen are at the basis of resistance to antiestrogens.
Beta-blockade consistently improves myocardial systolic function in patients with both nonischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The effects of beta-blockade on Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy (ACM), however, are unknown. We retrospectively evaluated the effects of beta-blockade on patients with ACM by using a case-controlled design. The control group consisted of 16 consecutively chosen age- and sex-matched patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) who were treated with beta-blockers. Patients with ACM had a baseline mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 28%, which improved to 41% (P = .041) after treatment with beta-blockers. The control group had a baseline mean LVEF of 26%, which improved to 32% (P = .015) after treatment. The mean duration of beta-blocker therapy in the Adriamycin and control groups was 8 and 9 months, respectively. The degree of improvement between the 2 groups was not significantly different. Beta-blockers have a beneficial effect on cardiac function in patients with ACM, which is at least comparable with other forms of heart failure with systolic dysfunction.
Membrane-initiated androgen actions have now been acknowledged, even though a specific binding site has not been biochemically characterized yet. Recent data indicate that testosterone-BSA, a non-permeable testosterone analog, can exert specific actions in breast cancer cell lines, including proper transcriptional effects, independent of the intracellular androgen sites. In the present work we explore the effects of testosterone-BSA in two specifically modified pathways, revealed by early trascriptome analysis, namely the non-genotropic androgen signaling and the HIF1alpha pathway. We provide evidence that p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt/NFkappaB and/or Rho/Actin pathways are directly involved in testosterone-induced apoptosis, while the JNK/c-JUN pathway is involved in membrane site-initiated transcription. Furthermore we show that membrane-acting androgens modify the transcription of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), leading to erythropoietin-initiated actions. Interestingly, association of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) together with testosterone-BSA protects cells from apoptosis, through discrete signaling events. The effect of testosterone-BSA is exerted through the classical erythropoietin promoter, while rHuEPO decreases the transcription of EPOR acting on a newly identified regulatory/promoter region, upstream of its known promoter. These results suggest a new interaction of membrane-acting androgen with EPOR and should be taken into account in the pharmaceutical manipulations of breast cancer patients.
Nitroglycerin (NTG) administration occasionally leads to syncope due to severe hypotension and bradycardia. This reaction resembles neurocardiogenic syncope but it may occur when the patient is in the supine position. To address the possible role of prevailing autonomic tone and baroreflex control in precipitation of NTG induced syncope, continuous noninvasive blood pressure and an ECG were taken shortly before NTG application in the supine position. Frequency-domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) and noninvasive indices of baroreflex were compared between subjects who did (n = 6) and did not (n = 41) develop syncope after NTG. Both groups differed only in the phase shift (P(CR)) between oscillations of blood pressure and heart rate during controlled respiration (0.1 Hz). P(CR) was significantly delayed in subjects who developed syncope than in controls (- 99.3+/-14.1 vs -65.5+/-27.0 degrees, P = 0.002). Thus, subjects with prolonged P(CR) are prone to NTG induced syncope because of increased lagging and, consequently, less stable baroreflex control.
The Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial (MDPIT) reported no consistent diltiazem effect on new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) during 12-52 months' follow-up after acute myocardial infarction. This was puzzling in light of the observation that patients with findings suggesting left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) at baseline on diltiazem had more cardiac events (cardiac mortality or recurrent nonfatal infarction) than such patients on placebo. We hypothesized that diltiazem increased the frequency of late CHF as well as of cardiac events, but only in patients predisposed by LVD. Using the same characterizing variables as the primary MDPIT analysis, we found that patients with pulmonary congestion, anterolateral Q wave infarction, or reduced ejection fraction (EF) at baseline were more likely to have CHF during follow-up than those without these markers of LVD. CHF was particularly frequent in the patients with LVD who were randomized to diltiazem. Among those with a baseline EF of less than 0.40, late CHF appeared in 12% (39/326) receiving placebo and 21% (61/297) receiving diltiazem (p = 0.004). Life table analysis in patients with an EF of less than 0.40 confirmed more frequent late CHF in those taking diltiazem (p = 0.0017). In addition, the diltiazem-associated rise in the frequency of late CHF was progressively greater with increasingly severe decrements in baseline EF. This diltiazem effect was absent in patients with pulmonary congestion at baseline but an EF of 0.40 or more, suggesting a unique association between diltiazem-related late CHF and systolic LVD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Effects of acute exposure to organophosphorous pesticides (OPs), chlorphenvinphos (CVP) or chlorphyriphos (CPF) on amphetamine (AMPH)- or scopolamine (SCOP)-induced open-field locomotion were compared in rats.
CVP and CPF were administered intraperitoneally, both at doses resulting in about 50% inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (rbcAChE). The pesticide groups did not differ one from another in the magnitude of the acute behavioral effects.
Three weeks after the exposure, i.e. when AChE activity returned to normal level, the behavioral response to AMPH and SCOP was significantly reduced in CVP-, but not in CPF-pretreated rats.
These results confirm that a single exposure to organophosphorous pesticides may result in neurobehavioral effects detectable after restitution of AChE. They also show that CVP and CPF differ in respect of long lasting functional consequences of exposure, which suggests a difference in the mechanism of toxicity.
Adverse drug reactions can vary from a simple rash to anaphylactic shock. While certain medications including the penicillins are well known to cause such reactions, other drugs are not as commonly recognized. Azathioprine hypersensitivity reactions tend to be benign and self-limiting with cessation of drug ingestion. We report a patient who had a hypersensitivity reaction to azathioprine, which manifested as distributive shock that mimicked sepsis. We also reviewed the English language literature for risk factors for a hypersensitivity reaction to azathioprine and its possible mechanism.
The effects of long-term diltiazem treatment on hemodynamic and cardiovascular characteristics were investigated in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and their respective untreated controls. The drug was administered to treated rats over a period of 24 weeks. Body weight, left ventricular weight, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, max dp/dt or maximum velocity of the contractile element (Vmax) were not significantly different in diltiazem-treated SHR and untreated SHR. In diltiazem-treated SHR, cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SI) were significantly increased and total peripheral resistance and the index of left ventricular compliance (delta P/delta V) were significantly decreased compared with untreated SHR. Left ventricular pumping ability in treated SHR was higher than that in untreated SHR, despite the low dose of diltiazem given. However, there was no significant difference between treated and untreated WKY. Long-term diltiazem treatment did not affect left ventricular function or biochemical properties in SHR and WKY. These data suggest that long-term diltiazem treatment improves pump function in SHR without changing blood pressure.
We report a patient with primary hypothyroidism, who developed hepatocellular injury due to levothyroxine, synthetic thyroxine. A 63-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to elevation of liver enzymes. The patient was diagnosed as having hypothyroidism and had been treated with levothyroxine for almost two months until admission. Drug-induced liver injury induced due to levothyroxine was suspected and liver enzymes were rapidly decreased after discontinuation of levothyroxine and dried thyroid powder, also containing thyroxine. Synthetic triiodothyronine, the deiodinated form of levothyroxine was administered instead, and was well tolerated by the patient. The drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) using levothyroxine was negative. Since triiodothyronine which structurally resembles levothyroxine did not cause liver injury, and DLST using levothyroxine was negative, it is unlikely that levothyroxine itself was targeted by the immune system. Rather, we assume that the complex of levothyroxine as the hapten and liver-related macromolecules in the body as the carrier might have acquired antigenicity in this patient and subsequently resulted in liver injury.
The thiazolidinedione compound troglitazone, which is used to treat non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in man, is also effective in the adipogenic NIDDM of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. To test the "lipotoxicity hypothesis," which attributes the beta cell dysfunction of adipogenic NIDDM to an excessive accumulation of fat in the pancreatic islets, we sought to determine if troglitazone-mediated amelioration of beta cell function in islets of ZDF rats might be associated with a reduction in their elevated triglyceride (TG) content. Troglitazone (10 microM) in the culture medium reduced the TG content of ZDF rats by 52%; this was reflected by decreased esterification and increased oxidation of [3H]palmitate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase mRNA fell by 57% and acyl-CoA synthetase mRNA by 67% (brain isoform) and 38% (liver isoform), all consistent with the effects of troglitazone on TG metabolism. The 52% decrease in islet TG was accompanied by >30- and 2-fold improvements in glucose- and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion, respectively. We conclude that troglitazone exerts direct lipopenic activity in normal islets and in islets of obese prediabetic ZDF rats; in the latter, this correlated with improvement in beta cell function. The results are consistent with the lipotoxicity hypothesis for adipogenic diabetes.
Several similarities exist between the alterations observed in the chronic pilocarpine model of recurrent seizures in the rat and those found in human temporal lobe epilepsy. The present studies are focused on changes in the GABA system in this model. Following the initial pilocarpine-induced seizures, a substantial loss of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-containing neurons has been found in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (Obenaus et al., J. Neurosci., 13 (1993) 4470-4485), and, recently, a loss of GAD mRNA-labeled neurons has also been found in stratum oriens of CA1. Yet numerous other GABA neurons remain within the hippocampal formation, and there appear to be multiple compensatory changes in these neurons. Labeling for GAD65 mRNA and associated protein is substantially increased in the remaining GABA neurons at 2-4 months after the initial seizure episode. Such increased labeling suggests that the remaining GABA neurons are part of a functional circuit and may be responding to the need for increased activity. Alterations also occur in at least one subunit of the GABA-A receptor. Labeling for the alpha(5) subunit mRNA is substantially decreased in CA1 and CA2 of pilocarpine-treated rats during the chronic, seizure-prone period. These findings emphasize the complexity of changes in the GABA system and indicate a need for evaluating the functional consequences of each of the changes. The initial loss of specific groups of GABA neurons could be a critical first step in the gradual development of epileptiform activity. While many of the subsequent changes in the GABA system may be considered to be compensatory, significant deficits of GABAergic function could remain.
To investigate the effect of beta(3)-adrenoceptor (beta(3)-AR) antagonist (SR59230A) on the cardiac function and left ventricular remodeling in a rat model of heart failure induced by isoproterenol (ISO), and to probe into its mechanism.
Eight rats were randomly selected to serve as controls from 85 male adult Wistar rats. After a heart failure model was reproduced, twenty remain rats were randomly divided into ISO group (n = 10) and SR59230A group (SR group, n = 10). ISO group received intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml saline twice a day; SR group received intraperitoneal injection of 85 nmol SR59230A in 1 ml saline twice a day; control group received no treatment. The parameters determined included echocardiogram, the expression of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) of left ventricle by the technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the ratio of left ventricular weight and body weight (LVW/BW), and the ratio of lung weight and body weight (PW/BW).
Compared with control group, the left ventricular end systolic pressure (LVESP), the maximum and minimum first derivative of left ventricular pressure (+/-dp/dtmax) were significantly decreased (all P<0.01), while heart rate (HR) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were significantly increased (both P<0.01) in ISO group. Compared with ISO group, LVESP, +/-dp/dtmax were markedly higher (P<0.05 or P<0.01) respectively, whereas HR and LVEDP were markedly lower (P<0.05 and P<0.01) in SR group, and there was no difference in HR between SR group and control group (P>0.05), while LVEDP was higher in RS group than control group (P<0.01). The levels of eNOS mRNA, protein and cGMP were significantly lower in SR group compared with ISO group (all P<0.01). In addition, when compared with ISO group, LVW/BW ratio and PW/BW ratio in SR group were also decreased (both P<0.05).
beta(3)-AR antagonist SR59230A can block the beta(3)-AR-NOS-cGMP pathway and improve cardiac function in heart failure in rat when if is administered for a long term. SR59230A can also improve left ventricular remodeling in a certain degree.
The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of the rs9939609 (T/A) gene variant in fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) on body weight changes after 3 years and its modification by a randomized nutritional intervention with a Mediterranean-style diet in a population of subjects at high cardiovascular risk.
A substudy of PREDIMED, which is a randomized trial aimed at assessing the effect of the Mediterranean diet (MD) for primary cardiovascular disease prevention. There were three nutritional intervention groups: two of them with a Mediterranean-style diet and the third was a control group advised to follow a conventional low-fat diet.
A total of 776 high cardiovascular risk subjects aged 55-80 years.
Anthropometric measurements were recorded at baseline and at 3 years. The participants were genotyped by RT-PCR, followed by allelic discrimination.
Homozygous subjects had the highest baseline body weight. The dominant model showed that subjects carrying the A allele had the lowest body weight gain (B=-0.685; P=0.022) after 3 years of nutritional intervention compared with nonmutated subjects (TT genotype) regardless of the nutritional intervention. Moreover, this effect was statistically significant in carriers of the A allele only among those allocated to the MD groups (B=-0.830; P=0.018), but it was not significant among those allocated to the control group (P for interaction=0.649).
This study confirmed the association between body weight and the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism. Interestingly, our results showed that, although at baseline the A allele was associated with higher body weight, after 3 years of nutritional intervention with a Mediterranean-style-diet, A-allele carriers had lower body weight gain than wild type subjects. No interaction between nutritional intervention and the polymorphism was found.
Somatic alterations of the lymphoid transcription factor gene PAX5 (also known as BSAP) are a hallmark of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), but inherited mutations of PAX5 have not previously been described. Here we report a new heterozygous germline variant, c.547G>A (p.Gly183Ser), affecting the octapeptide domain of PAX5 that was found to segregate with disease in two unrelated kindreds with autosomal dominant B-ALL. Leukemic cells from all affected individuals in both families exhibited 9p deletion, with loss of heterozygosity and retention of the mutant PAX5 allele at 9p13. Two additional sporadic ALL cases with 9p loss harbored somatic PAX5 substitutions affecting Gly183. Functional and gene expression analysis of the PAX5 mutation demonstrated that it had significantly reduced transcriptional activity. These data extend the role of PAX5 alterations in the pathogenesis of pre-B cell ALL and implicate PAX5 in a new syndrome of susceptibility to pre-B cell neoplasia.
One of the distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) paradigms used to study cochlear function is DPOAE (2f1-f2) ipsilateral suppression. Newborns do not have adultlike DPOAE suppression. At 6000 Hz, infants show excessively narrow DPOAE suppression tuning and shallow growth of suppression for low-frequency suppressor tones. The source of this immaturity is not known but the outer hair cell (OHC) is one possible locus. In the present study, DPOAE suppression was measured at f2 = 1500 and 6000 Hz from two groups with impaired OHC function in an attempt to model the observed immaturity in neonates: adults with aspirin-induced OHC dysfunction and subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Their DPOAE suppression results were compared to those obtained from a group of term newborns to address whether infant DPOAE suppression resembles suppression from individuals with known OHC dysfunction. Results indicate that aspirin systematically alters DPOAE suppression in adults at f2 = 6000 Hz, but not 1500 Hz. However, neither aspirin-induced OHC dysfunction nor naturally occurring SNHL produces "neonatal-like" DPOAE suppression at either test frequency. This finding does not support the hypothesis that non-adultlike DPOAE suppression characterizing newborns can be explained by minor impairments or alterations of OHC function.
Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) disorders are the most prevalent inborn metabolic diseases and remain without effective treatment to date. Up-regulation of residual enzyme activity has been proposed as a possible therapeutic approach in this group of disorders. As resveratrol (RSV), a natural compound, was proposed to stimulate mitochondrial metabolism in rodents, we tested the effect of this compound on mitochondrial functions in control or in Complex I (CI)- or Complex IV (CIV)-deficient patients' fibroblasts. We show that RSV stimulates the expression of a panel of proteins representing structural subunits or assembly factors of the five RC complexes, in control fibroblasts. In moderate RC-deficient patients' cells, RSV treatment increases the amount of mutated proteins and stimulates residual enzyme activities. In these patients' cells, we establish that up-regulation of RC enzyme activities induced by RSV translates into increased cellular O2 consumption rates and results in the correction of RC deficiencies. Importantly, RSV also prevents the accumulation of lactate that occurred in RC-deficient fibroblasts. Different complementary approaches demonstrate that RSV induces a mitochondrial biogenesis that might underlie the increase in mitochondrial capacities. Finally, we showed that, in human fibroblasts, RSV stimulated mitochondrial functions mainly in a SIRT1- and AMPK-independent manner and that its effects rather involved the estrogen receptor (ER) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) signaling pathways. These results represent the first demonstration that RSV could have a beneficial effect on inborn CI and CIV deficiencies from nuclear origin, in human fibroblasts and might be clinically relevant for the treatment of some RC deficiencies.
Quinine is widely used for nocturnal leg cramps, despite limited evidence of its clinical efficacy in this condition. Accidental overdose is associated with serious ocular complications and can potentially be fatal. We report the case of a 57-year-old man who presented with acute confusion and bilateral blindness after consuming approximately 7.2 g quinine sulphate along with an unknown quantity of alcohol. He was treated with general supportive measures and nitrates, with an apparent initial recovery, but visual field defects persisted. This case highlights the potential toxic effects of quinine, the dangers of its bulk prescription, and the lack of strict guidelines with regard to its prescription. We suggest that restricted prescribing for leg cramps, better patient education about the toxic nature of the drug, and clear labelling of this hazard on the dispensing bottles might lead to a reduction in the cases of quinine poisoning.
The use of azathioprine (AZA) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is limited by toxicity, which occurs in up to 20% of treated patients. Mutations in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) genes have been associated with the occurrence of AZA-related toxicity. The aim of our study was to determine the relative contribution of ITPA and TPMT mutations to the development of toxicity induced by AZA treatment in IBD patients.
ITPA(94C>A, IVS2+21A>C) and TPMT (238G>C, 460G>A, and 719A>G) genotypes were assessed in 262 IBD patients (159 females, 103 males; 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, 195 patients with Crohn's disease) treated with AZA and were correlated with the development of leukopenia and hepatotoxicity.
Leukopenia (leukocyte count, <3.0 x 10(9)/L) was observed in 4.6% of treated patients. The frequencies of mutant ITPA 94C>A and TPMT alleles were significantly higher in the leukopenic population compared with patients without leukopenia (16.7% and 5.4%, respectively, for ITPA 94C>A, and 20.8% and 4%, respectively, for TPMT). Moreover, the ITPA 94C>A and TPMT mutations predicted leukopenia: ITPA 94C>A odds ratio, 3.504; 95% confidence interval, 1.119-10.971 (P = .046); TPMT odds ratio, 6.316; 95% confidence interval, 2.141-18.634 (P = .004). Neither TPMT nor ITPA genotype predicted hepatotoxicity.
ITPA 94C>A and TPMT polymorphisms are associated with AZA-related leukopenia in IBD patients.
