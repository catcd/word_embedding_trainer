A pesticide patch test series was tested in 200 subjects, 50 of whom were agricultural workers. Positive reactions to fungicides were found in 24, almost all to thiophthalimides, especially captan, difolatan and folpet. Reactions to bis-dithiocarbamates and benomyl were rare, and to other pesticides not significant.
To report a patient who developed a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) related with amantadine therapy.
A 66-year-old woman, diagnosed with Parkinson disease, developed asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, lethargy and feeling of muscle weakness, and severe hyponatremia, with diagnostic criteria for SIADH, after exposure to amantadine. After amantadine withdrawal, these symptoms disappeared, and sodium levels reached normal values gradually.
The SIADH should be taken into account among the possible side effects of amantadine.
The retrospective study presented here reports clinical, electrophysiological and CT-data from 21 patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation for leukemia or aplastic anemia between 1980 and 1985. The aim of the investigation, which was performed at the end of 1986, was to elucidate whether antineoplastic drugs and radiation can result in long-term damage of the central nervous system. In 9 patients we observed neurological signs (1 leukencephalopathy, 5 cerebellar symptoms). Seven patients revealed dysrhythmia in the EEG and five had delayed latencies of visual evoked potentials. Eight patients exhibited pathological changes in CT (3 atrophy of supratentorial structures, 3 periventricular lucencies, 2 a combination of both). The results indicate that long-term damage to the CNS may be encountered after successful bone marrow transplantation.
Because of their better side-effect profile, atypical antipsychotic agents have replaced conventional antipsychotic agents as the first-line treatment for schizophrenia. Although atypical agents are less likely to be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms, such symptoms sometimes do occur in patients treated with atypical agents. The authors report the cases of two patients who developed akathisia after treatment with quetiapine for insomnia, consider previously reported cases of akathisia induced by atypical antipsychotic agents, discuss other medications that can induce similar symptoms, discuss treatments for akathisia, and examine issues in the use of quetiapine as a soporific agent.
In utero exposure to arsenic is known to adversely affect reproductive outcomes. Evidence of arsenic teratogenicity varies widely and depends on individual genotypic differences in sensitivity to As. In this study, we investigated the potential interaction between 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr) genotype and arsenic embryotoxicity using the Mthfr knockout mouse model.
Pregnant dams were treated with sodium arsenate, and reproductive outcomes including: implantation, resorption, congenital malformation and fetal birth weight were recorded at E18.5.
When the dams in Mthfr(+/-)×Mthfr(+/-) matings were treated with 7.2 mg/kg As, the resorption rate increased to 43.4%, from a background frequency of 7.2%. The As treatment also induced external malformations (40.9%) and significantly lowered the average fetal birth weight among fetuses, without any obvious toxic effect on the dam. When comparing the pregnancy outcomes resulting from different mating scenarios (Mthfr(+/+)×Mthfr(+/-), Mthfr(+/-)×Mthfr(+/-) and Mthfr(-/-)×(Mthfr+/-)) and arsenic exposure; the resorption rate showed a linear relationship with the number of null alleles (0, 1 or 2) in the Mthfr dams. Fetuses from nullizygous dams had the highest rate of external malformations (43%) and lowest average birth weight. When comparing the outcomes of reciprocal matings (nullizygote×wild-type versus wild-type×nullizygote) after As treatment, the null dams showed significantly higher rates of resorptions and malformations, along with lower fetal birth weights.
Maternal genotype contributes to the sensitivity of As embryotoxicity in the Mthfr mouse model. The fetal genotype, however, does not appear to affect the reproductive outcome after in utero As exposure.
The type I transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor and two follistatin motifs 2 (TMEFF2), is expressed mainly in brain and prostate. Expression of TMEFF2 is deregulated in prostate cancer, suggesting a role in this disease, but the molecular mechanism(s) involved in this effect are not clear. Although androgens promote tmeff2 transcription, androgen delivery to castrated animals carrying CWR22 xenografts increases TMEFF2 protein levels in the absence of mRNA changes, suggesting that TMEFF2 may also be post-transcriptionally regulated. Here we show that translation of TMEFF2 is regulated by androgens. Addition of physiological concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to prostate cancer cell lines increases translation of endogenous TMEFF2 or transfected TMEFF2-Luciferase fusions, and this effect requires the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of TMEFF2. Using chemical and siRNA inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR), we show that the androgen effect on TMEFF2 translation is mediated by the AR. Importantly, DHT also promotes phosphorylation of the α subunit of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) in an AR-dependent manner, paralleling the effect on TMEFF2 translation. Moreover, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, which promote eIF2α phosphorylation, also stimulate TMEFF2 translation. These results indicate that androgen signaling promotes eIF2α phosphorylation and subsequent translation of TMEFF2 via a mechanism that requires uORFs in the 5'-UTR of TMEFF2.
Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is associated with an approximately 3.7 Mb common deletion in 17p11.2 and characterized by its craniofacial and neurobehavioral abnormalities. The reciprocal duplication leads to dup(17)(p11.2p11.2) associated with the Potocki-Lupski syndrome (PLS), a neurological disorder whose features include autism. Retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1) appears to be responsible for the majority of clinical features in both SMS and PLS. Mouse models of these syndromes harboring an approximately 2 Mb chromosome engineered deletion and duplication, respectively, displayed abnormal locomotor activity and/or learning deficits. To determine the contribution of RAI1 in the neurobehavioral traits in SMS, we performed a battery of behavioral tests on Rai1 mutant mice and the Df(11)17-1/+ mice that have a small deletion of approximately 590 kb. The mice with the small deletion were hypoactive like the large deletion mice and they also showed learning deficits. The Rai1+/- mice exhibited normal locomotor activity. However, they had an abnormal electroencephalogram with overt seizure observed in a subset of mice. The few surviving Rai1-/- mice displayed more severe neurobehavioral abnormalities including hind limb clasping, overt seizures, motor impairment and context- and tone-dependant learning deficits. X-gal staining of the Rai1+/- mice suggests that Rai1 is predominantly expressed in neurons of the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Our results suggest that Rai1 is a critical gene in the central nervous system functioning in a dosage sensitive manner and that the neurobehavioral phenotype is modified by regulator(s) in the approximately 590 kb genomic interval, wherein the major modifier affecting the craniofacial penetrance resides.
Pulmonary vasodilation is mediated through the activation of protein kinase G (PKG) via a signaling pathway involving nitric oxide (NO), natriuretic peptides (NP), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In pulmonary hypertension secondary to congenital heart disease, this pathway is endogenously activated by an early vascular upregulation of NO and increased myocardial B-type NP expression and release. In the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, this pathway is exogenously activated using inhaled NO or other pharmacological agents. Despite this activation of cGMP, vascular dysfunction is present, suggesting that NO-cGMP independent mechanisms are involved and were the focus of this study. Exposure of pulmonary artery endothelial or smooth muscle cells to the NO donor, Spermine NONOate (SpNONOate), increased peroxynitrite (ONOO(-) ) generation and PKG-1α nitration, while PKG-1α activity was decreased. These changes were prevented by superoxide dismutase (SOD) or manganese(III)tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP) and mimicked by the ONOO(-) donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine N-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1). Peripheral lung extracts from 4-week old lambs with increased pulmonary blood flow and pulmonary hypertension (Shunt lambs with endogenous activation of cGMP) or juvenile lambs treated with inhaled NO for 24 h (with exogenous activation of cGMP) revealed increased ONOO(-) levels, elevated PKG-1α nitration, and decreased kinase activity without changes in PKG-1α protein levels. However, in Shunt lambs treated with L-arginine or lambs administered polyethylene glycol conjugated-SOD (PEG-SOD) during inhaled NO exposure, ONOO(-) and PKG-1α nitration were diminished and kinase activity was preserved. Together our data reveal that vascular dysfunction can occur, despite elevated levels of cGMP, due to PKG-1α nitration and subsequent attenuation of activity.
Lack of appropriate animal models simulating core behavioural aspects of human psychosis is a major limitation in schizophrenia research. The use of drugs, that is believed to act through N-methyl d-aspartate receptor, has been demonstrated to mimic relatively broader range of behavioural symptoms in putative animal models. Our goal in this study has been to further evaluate one such drug, ketamine in mice and characterize some selective behavioural phenotypes associated with the drug dosage, treatment period and withdrawal effects to extend the understanding of this model. Our results indicate that acute treatment of ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) induced hyperlocomotory response and reduced the 'transfer-latency time' in passive avoidance test but did not have any effect in the forced swim test (negative symptoms). In contrast, chronic administration of ketamine not only produced significant 'hyperactivity' response but also enhanced the immobility period in animals during the forced swim test and reduced the latency period in the passive avoidance test. Further, these behavioural alterations persisted at least for 10 days after the withdrawal of ketamine treatment. These observations were substantiated by using standard typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.), clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and risperidone (0.025 mg/kg, i.p.). Therefore, the present study suggests that the chronic treatment with ketamine has the potential of exhibiting changes in broader range of behavioural domains than the acute treatment. Hence, animals chronically treated with ketamine might serve as a useful tool to study the underlying pathogenic mechanisms associated with some symptoms in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.
STI571, or imatinib, selectively inhibits BCR/ABL, PDGFR and c-kit kinase activity. It has been reported that a large proportion of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and tumors express c-kit and that STI571 inhibits tumor cell growth. We therefore investigated the therapeutic efficacy of STI571, alone or combined with chemotherapy, in human SCLC cells or tumors xenografted into nude mice. The level of c-kit mRNA expression was variable in SCLC tumors (positive for 2 of 4 xenografts), and c-kit protein was not detected by immunohistochemistry. On the 4 xenografted tumors, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta were not detected by immunohistochemistry. STI571 induced inhibition of proliferation of the SCLC6 cell line without inducing apoptosis; in contrast, in combination with etoposide or topotecan, the growth inhibition of SCLC6 cells induced by STI571 was increased, with apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Four human SCLC xenografts (SCLC6, SCLC61, SCLC74 and SCLC108) were transplanted into mice. After intraperitoneal injection of STI571, we observed 80%, 40% and 78% growth inhibition of SCLC6, SCLC61 and SCLC108 tumors, respectively, without any significant inhibition of SCLC74 tumor growth. In mice bearing responsive SCLC tumors, we observed an increase of growth inhibition induced by chemotherapy (etoposide + ifosfamide or topotecan) by concomitant and continuous administration of STI571, associated with an increase of toxic deaths. In SCLC6-bearing mice receiving sequential treatments, we observed a reduction of toxic deaths but a decrease of synergistic antitumor efficacy. In conclusion, the efficacy of STI571 alone in SCLC xenografted tumors was variable and did not depend on c-kit expression. Moreover, a significant increase of chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition was obtained by concomitant administration of STI571 that should be carefully investigated in SCLC patients.
Propofol infusion syndrome has been increasingly recognized as a syndrome of unexplained myocardial failure, metabolic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis with renal failure. It has been described only with acute neurologic injury or acute inflammatory diseases complicated by severe infections or sepsis. It appears to develop in the context of high-dose, prolonged propofol (100 microg/kg/min) treatment in combination with catecholamines and/or steroids. This was first noted in children but is increasingly recognized in adults. This is a case report of 2 patients (a 42-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl) who had acute renal failure associated with use of propofol in the appropriate clinical setting. It examines the pathophysiology and the possible mechanisms of this condition and illustrates the need to consider it as the cause of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure in critically ill patients.
Sixty-three mainly male alcoholics were randomly assigned to placebo or lofexidine treatment for 48 hr shortly after admission to the hospital. Their starting points were similar regarding their semiquantitative estimates of alcohol withdrawal symptoms (AWS). Their demographics, histories of past alcohol use, physical findings, and laboratory abnormalities usually associated with alcoholism were similar. Starting 3 hr after 0.4 mg of oral lofexidine, which was given every 6 hr as eight doses, the AWS scores were significantly lower than those of the placebo group. Hypotension was the strongest finding. Six placebo recipients had to be prematurely interrupted due to increasing or intolerable alcohol withdrawal symptoms and switched to a benzodiazepine. Only one lofexidine recipient was prematurely interrupted, due to transient hallucinations. The study has a large placebo effect, as both groups of patients rated the treatment process very highly. Lofexidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, was superior to placebo in alcohol withdrawal. This drug, as with its analogue clonidine, may represent a new and important pharmacological treatment for alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
The exact pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remain unclear. Recent studies have shown that mucosal immune and inflammatory responses, characterized by specific cytokine and chemokine profiles, may underlie the diverse esophageal phenotypes of GERD. Interleukin 8 (IL-8), a representative chemokine, mediates neutrophil trafficking via its receptors, mainly CXCR-1. The IL-8 mRNA and protein levels are increased in the esophageal mucosa, not only in reflux esophagitis (RE), but also in endoscopy-negative GERD (NERD), through activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which is a pivotal transcription factor. Mucosal IL-8 concentrations have been found to parallel the endoscopic severity of RE, implying that this cytokine is a key player in the development of GERD. The mucosal levels of the C-C chemokines, macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and regulated on activation normal T-cell-expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES), which primarily attract monocytes and lymphocytes to the site of inflammation, respectively, are also elevated in RE. The secreted levels of IL-8 and IL-1beta, a prototype of proinflammatory cytokine, are maximal at the proximal segment within Barrett esophagus (BE) tissue. The expression of the two pleiotrophic proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, is enhanced in the intestinal epithelium of BE, which places this epithelium at a higher risk for developing malignancy. BE is characterized by a distinct Th-2 predominant cytokine profile (IL-4 and -10), compared to the proinflammatory nature of RE (interferone-gamma). Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole reduces the mucosal levels of IL-8 mRNA and protein in GERD, including RE and NERD. This may occur in part through an anti-inflammatory action of proton pump inhibitors beyond gastric acid inhibition.
Many researches show that traditional Indonesian diet is good for physical health. The present study examines the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic potentials of aqueous extract of tempe (fermented soya-beans) and Curcuma domestica in an experimental photochemical thrombogenesis model using rat femoral artery. A total of 15 male Wistar rats weighing 250 g were used, and divided into three groups: control (group-1, n = 5), animals, treated orally with 0.25 ml aqueous extracts of 50 g tempe (fermented soybean cake) once daily for 7 consecutive days (group-2, n = 5) and animals treated orally with 0.25 ml aqueous extracts of 10 g roots of Curcuma domestica once daily for 5 consecutive days (group-3, n = 5). All animals were anesthetized, and Sn-pyrophosphate and Tc99m solutions were injected intravenously for in vivo red cell radioactive labeling. Femoral arterial occlusion was observed, using a gamma camera. Induction of femoral arterial thrombosis was effected following an endothelial injury by free radicals produced by green light-irradiated Rose Bengal (10 mg/kg). The results showed that in the control group arterial total flow occlusion was seen in 15 min of irradiation. The results of MDA absorbency was 0.3700 +/- 1.7 nmol/ml in control group-1, 0.0520 +/- 0.025 in group-2 (significant p < 0.05 in comparison to control group) and 0.2780 +/- 0.027 in group-3 (non-significant). Interleukin-1alpha plasma level was 14.44 +/- 2.3 in control group-1, 8.93 +/- 2.4 in group-2 (significant p < 0.05), and 6.21 +/- 2.5 in group-3 (significant p < 0.05). Plasma thromboxane B2 plasma level was 20.31 +/- 2.4 in control group-1, 14.32 +/- 2.2 in group-2 (significant p < 0.05), and 19.41 +/- 2.1 in group-3 (significant). This study suggests the potential antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effect that the dietary aqueous extracts has in rat femoral artery.
Localization of dural fistulas in the region of the anterior or lateral skull base may be difficult. For many years, a sodium fluorescein solution of 0.5 to 5% (2.5-50 mg) has been administered intrathecally by way of the lumbar space. However, fluorescein is not commercially available for this stated purpose in either Germany or the United States.
Retrospectively, 420 fluorescein applications by the authors were retrospectively analyzed. Under the Freedom of Information Act, the United States Federal Drug Administration and the manufactures of fluorescein were queried for adverse reaction reports.
Four hundred twenty fluorescein applications in 305 patients could be evaluated. Mean age of recipients was 46.9 years, ranging from 1 to 82 years. At a concentration of 5% fluorescein, 26 patients on the day of surgery and 69, 37, 34, and 14 patients on days 2 through 4 suffered from minor side effects that may or may not have been related to this drug. Two of these patients had grand mal seizures, which were attributable to simultaneous intrathecal application of contrast medium. All other side effects were thought to be the result of a postspinal headache and related lumbar puncture. At a concentration of 0.5%, the intraoperative intrathecal administration of 0.5 to 2 mL of fluorescein followed by 4 to 5 days of lumbar drainage resulted in some degree of spinal headache without other complications. In both groups, no patient had sequelae longer than 4 weeks. An additional seven complications were reported to the Federal Drug Administration and the fluorescein manufacturers at doses of 100 to 700 mg.
Complications from intrathecal application of fluorescein appears to be dose dependent. At concentrations of 5%, or preferably lower, side effects are transient. A grand mal seizure can be minimized when following the general cautions of lumbar puncture and dose. The patient should be supervised for 24 hours. A written informed consent from patients for use of fluorescein is recommended.
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of aggression, agitation, and psychosis in elderly nursing-home patients with dementia.
Elderly patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type, vascular dementia, or a combination of the 2 (i.e., mixed dementia) and significant aggressive behaviors were randomized to receive, for a period of 12 weeks, a flexible dose of either placebo or risperidone solution up to a maximum of 2 mg/day. Outcome measures were the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale, and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and of Change (CGI-C) scales.
A total of 345 patients were randomized to treatment with risperidone or placebo, and 337 patients received at least one dose of study drug. The trial was completed by 67% of patients in the placebo group and 73% of patients in the risperidone group. The mean +/- SE dose of risperidone was 0.95 +/- 0.03 mg/day. The primary endpoint of the study, the difference from baseline to endpoint in CMAI total aggression score, showed a significant reduction in aggressive behavior for risperidone versus placebo (p <.001). A similar improvement was also seen for the CMAI total non-aggression subscale (p <.002) and for the BEHAVE-AD total (p <.001) and psychotic symptoms subscale (p =.004). At endpoint, the CGI-S and the CGI-C scores indicated a significantly greater improvement with risperidone compared with placebo (p <.001). Overall, 94% and 92% of the risperidone and placebo groups, respectively, reported at least 1 adverse event. Somnolence and urinary tract infection were more common with risperidone treatment, whereas agitation was more common with placebo. There was no significant difference in the number of patients who reported extrapyramidal symptoms between the risperidone (23%) and placebo (16%) groups.
Treatment with low-dose (mean = 0.95 mg/day) risperidone resulted in significant improvement in aggression, agitation, and psychosis associated with dementia.
Because of the significant morbidity and lethality caused by alcoholic liver disease (ALD), there remains a need to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that can be targeted to prevent and treat ALD. Toward this goal, minimally invasive biomarker discovery represents an outstanding approach for these purposes. The mechanisms underlying ALD include hepatic lipid accumulation. As the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) has been shown to inhibit steatosis, the present study examined the role of PPARβ/δ in ALD coupling metabolomic, biochemical and molecular biological analyses. Wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null mice were fed either a control or 4% ethanol diet and examined after 4-7 months of treatment. Ethanol fed Pparβ/δ-null mice exhibited steatosis after short-term treatment compared to controls, the latter effect appeared to be due to increased activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). The wild-type and Pparβ/δ-null mice fed the control diet showed clear differences in their urinary metabolomic profiles. In particular, metabolites associated with arginine and proline metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism, were markedly different between genotypes suggesting a constitutive role for PPARβ/δ in the metabolism of these amino acids. Interestingly, urinary excretion of taurine was present in ethanol-fed wild-type mice but markedly lower in similarly treated Pparβ/δ-null mice. Evidence suggests that PPARβ/δ modulates pyridoxal kinase activity by altering Km, consistent with the observed decreased in urinary taurine excretion. These data collectively suggest that PPARβ/δ prevents ethanol-induced hepatic effects by inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis, modulation of amino acid metabolism, and altering pyridoxal kinase activity.
The authors report on their experiences gained during follow-up studies in 3 children, who as neonates had had renal venous thrombosis, and had been treated with heparin. On the basis of the relevant literature and their own observations, the authors suggest heparinisation during the acute stage.
Danazol, an inhibitor of pituitary gonadotropin with weak androgenic effect, is currently being used for the treatment of endometriosis. In contrast to other C17 alkylated anabolic steroids, it has been rarely associated with the occurrence of primary liver tumors. We present the case of a patient with endometriosis in whom a hepatocellular adenoma was discovered after 14 years of treatment with danazol for endometriosis. The patient showed no clinical signs of a liver tumor and it was only detected by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When long-term danazol therapy is required, regular ultrasonography for monitoring and early tumor detection is recommended.
Haematological anomalies are frequent during HIV infection, and can be the fact of virus and or bone marrow toxicity of antiretroviral drugs. In order to analyze the evolution of the haematological parameters during HAART this work was carried out in the internal medicine department of the national teaching hospital Yalgado-Ouédraogo in Ouagadougou. So 107 patients receiving for the first time HAART and followed regularly were retained. The immunological efficacy at the end of the first six months was 60, 75% with an average gain of 119 CD4/mm3. The haematological changes at the end of these first six months showed: --an anaemia in 51.4% of the cases at month 6 versus 80.3% at baseline (p=0.0001). The average rate of haemoglobin was 11.8 versus 11.2 g/dl at baseline in the AZT containing HAART regimen (p=0.014) and 12.2 versus 10.7 g/dl at baseline in the group without AZT (p=0.00006). --a neutropenia in 35.5% of the cases at month 6 versus 31.7% at baseline (p=0.6). The average rate of neutrophil was 1908/mm3 versus 2267.1/mm3 at baseline in the AZT containing HAART regimen and 2150.7/mm3 versus 2001.9/mm3 at baseline in the group without AZT These results show that the therapeutic efficacy measured on the immunological answer is accompanied by a reduction of haematological anomalies. They also suggest the necessity to evaluate the cotrimoxazole impact before deciding the interruption of AZT.
Some types of cosmetic products such as hand soaps and creams are commonly used several times a day, especially in occupational use situations. Little has experimentally been shown of how the daily frequency of the application of an allergen in a product influences the allergic response. This study investigates the allergic responses elicited in presensitized individuals when exposed to a specific amount of allergen applied either in 1 application per day or distributed over 4 applications per day. As model allergen, the cosmetic preservative methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN) is used. 19 contact allergic individuals and 12 controls participated in a double-blind, randomized use test. To areas on the forearms were applied 2 drops either once daily of a solution containing 0.04% MDBGN or 4 times a day of a solution containing 0.01% MDBGN. 14 of 19 patients developed dermatitis following the application of approximately equal amounts of MDBGN on both arms. Controls were negative. In this experiment, applications of 0.04% MDBGN once daily or 0.01% MDBGN 4 times daily had, in a use test, approximately equal capabilities of provoking allergic contact dermatitis. This adds new knowledge to the risk assessment and regulation of cosmetic allergens. However, these results may be highly allergen dependent, and further studies are needed before more general conclusions can be made.
