Described are the susceptibility of the Indian langur (Presbytis entellus) to Leishmania donovani and the consequent haematological and serum biochemical changes. The host response to antileishmanial chemotherapy and the immunological profile were also examined. Each langur was inoculated intravenously with 1 x 10(8) amastigotes; a spleen biopsy carried out on day 35 post-infection (p.i.) revealed 10-13 L. donovani bodies per 500 cell nuclei, which reached a maximum of 130-195 at death (day 105-110 p.i.). The infected monkeys lost body weight, developed severe anaemia, lymphocytosis, hyperproteinaemia, hypergammaglobulinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and an increase in the level of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase (AAT). Treatment with sodium stibogluconate (60 mg Sb5+ per kg body weight intramuscularly for 10 days) reduced the number of spleen parasites (0-1 amastigotes per 500 cell nuclei) but after the therapy the parasites appeared in the skin, which had previously been free of infection. Relapse occurred on day 30 post-treatment (10-24 amastigotes per 500 cell nuclei) and the parasites were resistant to repeat intensive therapy (120 mg Sb5+ per kg per day x 30 days). The stibogluconate treatment caused a proportionate reduction in the haematological and biochemical parameters to normal values except for alkaline phosphatase and AAT, which remained elevated. The level of IgG antibodies, which rose during the infection, rapidly fell to the pretreatment value following the first therapeutic schedule and then increased a second time coinciding with relapse. Our findings suggest that langurs could serve as acceptable models for human visceral leishmaniasis.
Several epidemiological studies have reported an association between arsenic exposure and increased rates of psychiatric disorders, including depression, in exposed populations. We have previously demonstrated that developmental exposure to low amounts of arsenic induces depression in adulthood along with several morphological and molecular aberrations, particularly associated with the hippocampus and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The extent and potential reversibility of this toxin-induced damage has not been characterized to date. In this study, we assessed the effects of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, on adult animals exposed to arsenic during development. Perinatal arsenic exposure (PAE) induced depressive-like symptoms in a mild learned helplessness task and in the forced swim task after acute exposure to a predator odor (2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, TMT). Chronic fluoxetine treatment prevented these behaviors in both tasks in arsenic-exposed animals and ameliorated arsenic-induced blunted stress responses, as measured by corticosterone (CORT) levels before and after TMT exposure. Morphologically, chronic fluoxetine treatment reversed deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) after PAE, specifically differentiation and survival of neural progenitor cells. Protein expression of BDNF, CREB, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and HDAC2 was significantly increased in the dentate gyrus of arsenic animals after fluoxetine treatment. This study demonstrates that damage induced by perinatal arsenic exposure is reversible with chronic fluoxetine treatment resulting in restored resiliency to depression via a neurogenic mechanism.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used cancer chemotherapeutic agent. However, it generates free oxygen radicals that result in serious dose-limiting cardiotoxicity. Supplementations with berries were proven effective in reducing oxidative stress associated with several ailments. The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential protective effect of cranberry extract (CRAN) against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. CRAN was given orally to rats (100mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days) and DOX (15mg/kg; i.p.) was administered on the seventh day. CRAN protected against DOX-induced increased mortality and ECG changes. It significantly inhibited DOX-provoked glutathione (GSH) depletion and accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyls in cardiac tissues. The reductions of cardiac activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GR) were significantly mitigated. Elevation of cardiac myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in response to DOX treatment was significantly hampered. Pretreatment of CRAN significantly guarded against DOX-induced rise of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) as well as troponin I level. CRAN alleviated histopathological changes in rats' hearts treated with DOX. In conclusion, CRAN protects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. This can be attributed, at least in part, to CRAN's antioxidant activity.
Treatment efficacy, oto- and nephrotoxicity, and aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a prospective, comparative, randomized clinical study of aminoglycosides given once a day or three times a day for severe infections. Sixty patients were treated with netilmicin or gentamicin 4.5 mg/kg bodyweight/day, either once a day or divided into three doses a day. The patients were allocated randomly to the different groups. The clinical effect was difficult to compare in the different groups, because of the small numbers of patients. Therapeutic failures were seen in seven patients (three after one and four after three doses per day). Two patients, one with Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis and one with streptococcal endocarditis, on netilmicin once daily and conventional high-dose therapy with a penicillin had positive blood cultures after five and seven days of treatment, respectively. Vestibular function and hearing acuity were examined by serial audiograms and electronystagmograms. In spite of extensive diagnostic evaluation, only two cases of ototoxicity were detected. One patient treated with gentamicin three times a day developed vertigo and a severe abnormality of her electronystagmogram. One young patient treated with gentamicin once daily had a slight bilateral reduction of hearing. Nephrotoxicity was mild and did not differ in the four treatment groups. This was the first investigation of a once-daily dosing regimen conducted in seriously ill patients with systemic infections. We could not demonstrate any evidence that aminoglycoside treatment once daily has greater oto- or nephrotoxicity than the traditional three times daily regimen.
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder believed to be exclusively caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene coding for the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. Common findings in CTX are tendon xanthomas, cataracts and progressive neurological dysfunction. Here, we characterize an adult female patient with tendon xanthomas and classic biochemical findings of CTX (i.e. high levels of bile alcohols and cholestanol and extremely low levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in plasma). Additionally, sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in cultured monocyte-derived macrophages from this patient was <5% of normal. Sequencing the CYP27A1 gene uncovered that the patient is heterozygous for two previously undescribed base substitutions in exon 8, C478A and C479A, which are expected to affect the haeme-binding domain of the enzyme. When expressed in HEK293 cells, the corresponding protein had only 8% of normal enzymatic activity. No other mutation was found in the open reading frame of the CYP27A1 gene, intron-exon boundaries or in the 5'-untranslated region up to 5000 bp distal to the translational start site. Sequencing mRNA isolated from leucocytes from the patient revealed a 1 : 1 ratio of mutated and nonmutated species, with total mRNA levels that were not significantly different from the controls. It is concluded that the patient is heterozygous for two mutations affecting one allele of the CYP27A1 gene and with at least one additional yet undefined gene that is of critical importance for the activity of sterol 27-hydroxylase.
We reviewed 116 consecutive adults hospitalized for hematuria (92 with gross and 24 with microscopic hematuria). The cause of hematuria (that is neoplasia, stones, infection and inflammation) was recognized in approximately 79 per cent of the 116 patients (group 1), while 21 per cent (group 2) had idiopathic hematuria. Review of drug history in these 2 groups revealed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used in 1 per cent of the patients in group 1 compared to 54 per cent in group 2. To confirm these findings we reviewed a control group of 60 patients without hematuria hospitalized for benign prostatic hyperplasia and followup of bladder tumors, and found a 3.3 per cent prevalence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These findings implicate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use as a potential cause of idiopathic hematuria.
Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare autosomal recessive disease that manifests as an inability of the affected individual to absorb intestinal zinc, and therefore patients have nutritional zinc deficiency. Without zinc therapy, this condition is fatal. Mutations in the SLC39A4 gene are responsible for acrodermatitis enteropathica. This gene encodes one member of a human zinc/iron-regulated transporter-like protein, also known as ZIP4, and consists of 12 exons and spans about 4.7 kb. We describe a novel mutation in a Tunisian family in which a chain termination codon in exon 3 yielded a truncated ZIP4 zinc transporter protein.
In the current study our objective was to develop a murine model of human hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS) and severe mevalonic aciduria (MA), autoinflammatory disorders associated with mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD). Deletion of one Mvk allele (Mvk (+/-)) yielded viable mice with significantly reduced liver Mvk enzyme activity; multiple matings failed to produce Mvk (-/-) mice. Cholesterol levels in tissues and blood, and isoprene end-products (ubiquinone, dolichol) in tissues were normal in Mvk (+/-) mice; conversely, mevalonate concentrations were increased in spleen, heart, and kidney yet normal in brain and liver. While the trend was for higher IgA levels in Mvk (+/-) sera, IgD levels were significantly increased (9-12-fold) in comparison to Mvk (+/+) littermates, in both young (<15 weeks) and older (>15 weeks) mice. Mvk (+/-) animals manifested increased serum TNF-alpha as compared to wild-type littermates, but due to wide variation in levels between individual Mvk (+/-) mice the difference in means was not statistically significant. Mvk (+/-) mice represent the first animal model of HIDS, and should prove useful for examining pathophysiology associated with this disorder.
The roles of glutathione (GSH), cysteine, vitamin C, liposome-encapsulated superoxide dismutase (L-SOD) and vitamin E in preventing oxidative DNA damage and cytotoxicity in the rat kidney after administration of potassium bromate (KBrO3) to male F344 rats were investigated by measuring 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), an oxidative DNA product, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and relative kidney weight (RKW). Combined pre- and posttreatment of animals with 2 x 800 mg/kg GSH i.p. inhibited the increase of 8-OH-dG, LPO levels and RKW caused by 80 mg/kg KBrO3 i.p. administration. In contrast, pretreatment with 0.3 ml/kg diethylmaleate (DEM) i.p., a depletor of tissue GSH, was associated with elevation of 8-OH-dG, LPO levels and RKW after a 20 mg/kg KBrO3 i.p. treatment, which itself caused no change. Administration of KBrO3 itself reduced renal non-protein thiol levels, but this was inhibited by the two doses of exogenous GSH. Combined treatment with DEM and KBrO3 lowered the non-protein thiol level in the kidney more than did DEM treatment alone. Protective effects against the oxidative damage caused by KBrO3 were also observed for pre- and posttreatment with 400 mg/kg cysteine i.p., another sulfhydryl compound, and daily i.g. application of 200 mg/kg vitamin C for 5 days. However, no influence was evident after pre- and posttreatment with 18,000 U/kg L-SOD i.p. or daily i.g. 100 mg/kg of vitamin E for 5 days. The results suggest that intracellular GSH plays an essential protective role against renal oxidative DNA damage and nephrotoxicity caused by KBrO3.
ACE-inhibitors prevent the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The tumor suppressor gene p53 up-regulates the cellular renin-angiotensin system, resulting in ANG II synthesis, which activates p53 creating a positive feedback loop. One hundred and fourteen rabbits were separated into groups A (control), B (sham-operated), C and D. In groups C and D, an aortic stenosis was performed, and in group D the animals were treated with enalapril. For p53 determination, LV specimens were examined by Western blot analysis and an immunohistochemical study was performed, except for samples from group D. In conclusion, LVH was significantly induced at 7 and 28 days after aortic stenosis with no difference between the two periods, while enalapril prevented hypertrophy in these two groups. p53 was transcriptionally activated and immunoreactively present after acute pressure overload as well as in the sham-operated group. Enalapril decreased the p53 expression at 180 min, 7 and 28 days following aortic stenosis.
We present clinical and molecular findings of three patients with an EDS VIB phenotype from two consanguineous families. The clinical findings of EDS kyphoscoliotic type (EDS type VIA and B) comprise kyphoscoliosis, muscular hypotonia, hyperextensible, thin and bruisable skin, atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility and variable ocular involvement. Distinct craniofacial abnormalities, joint contractures, wrinkled palms, and normal urinary pyridinoline ratios distinguish EDS VIB from EDS VIA. A genome-wide SNP scan and sequence analyses identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (NM_130468.2:c.145delG, NP_569735.1:p.Val49*) in CHST14, encoding dermatan-4-sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST-1), in two Turkish siblings. Subsequent sequence analysis of CHST14 identified a homozygous 20-bp duplication (NM_130468.2:c.981_1000dup, NP_569735.1:p.Glu334Glyfs*107) in an Indian patient. Loss-of-function mutations in CHST14 were recently reported in adducted thumb–clubfoot syndrome (ATCS). Patients with ATCS present similar craniofacial and musculoskeletal features as the EDS VIB patients reported here, but lack the severe skin manifestations. By identifying an identical mutation in patients with EDS VIB and ATCS, we show that both conditions form a phenotypic continuum. Our findings confirm that the EDS-variant associated with CHST14 mutations forms a clinical spectrum, which we propose to coin as “musculocontractural EDS” and which results from a defect in dermatan sulfate biosynthesis, perturbing collagen assembly.
In order to define the means of prevention of the ocular toxicity of ethambutol (EMB), 72 patients under treatment with EMB-INH-Rifampicin combination were subjected to systematic analysis of plasma, blood and urinary zinc levels together with a full ophthalmic examination. Comparison of the results from 12 patients sustaining ocular damage at the time of treatment with the results of 60 others: 1) demonstrates the existence of a correlation between plasma zinc levels before treatment and the probability of ocular damage from EMB (high risk for zinc is less than 0.70 mg/l - almost no risk for zinc greater than 1 mg/l); 2) confirms that dyschromatopsia is one of the first signs of ocular damage through EMB and thus constitutes an alarm signal; 3) suggests that the ocular toxicity of EMB might appear in the retina before the optic nerve.
Pain threshold for thermal stimulus was studied in male albino rats before and after three days of treatment with testosterone. It was also determined 15 days after castration and three days after testosterone treatment of castrated rats. There was a significant reduction in pain threshold after testosterone treatment and a marked increase in pain threshold after castration. This increase disappeared after administration of testosterone to the castrated rats.
The advanced glycation end-product (AGE) hypothesis proposes that accelerated chemical modification of proteins by glucose during hyperglycemia contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. The two most commonly measured AGEs, N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine and pentosidine, are glycoxidation products, formed from glucose by sequential glycation and autoxidation reactions. Although several compounds have been developed as AGE inhibitors and are being tested in animal models of diabetes and in clinical trials, the mechanism of action of these inhibitors is poorly understood. In general, they are thought to function as nucleophilic traps for reactive carbonyl intermediates in the formation of AGEs; however alternative mechanisms of actions, such as chelation, have not been rigorously examined. To distinguish between the carbonyl trapping and antioxidant activity of AGE inhibitors, we have measured the chelating activity of the inhibitors by determining the concentration required for 50% inhibition of the rate of copper-catalyzed autoxidation of ascorbic acid in phosphate buffer. All AGE inhibitors studied were chelators of copper, as measured by inhibition of metal-catalyzed autoxidation of ascorbate. Apparent binding constants for copper ranged from approximately 2 mm for aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine, to 10-100 microm for carnosine, phenazinediamine, OPB-9195 and tenilsetam. The AGE-breakers, phenacylthiazolium and phenacyldimethylthiazolium bromide, and their hydrolysis products, were among the most potent inhibitors of ascorbate oxidation. We conclude that, at millimolar concentrations of AGE inhibitors used in many in vitro studies, inhibition of AGE formation results primarily from the chelating or antioxidant activity of the AGE inhibitors, rather than their carbonyl trapping activity. Further, at therapeutic concentrations, the chelating activity of AGE inhibitors and AGE-breakers may contribute to their inhibition of AGE formation and protection against development of diabetic complications.
An association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in serum of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has been suggested. We conducted a prospective study in CHC patients complicated with hyperlipidaemia, to examine whether bezafibrate, which is commonly used for treatment of hyperlipidaemia, reduces serum HCV-RNA titre and improves liver dysfunction. Fifteen patients received daily oral bezafibrate treatment (400 mg/day) for 8 weeks, and its effects on serum lipids, transaminases, HCV-RNA titres, and HCV-RNA titres bound to LDL were evaluated. Fifteen untreated patients with CHC and hyperlipidaemia were used as controls. The mean serum alanine aminotransferase levels and HCV-RNA titres significantly decreased at the end of bezafibrate therapy in the treated group (105 +/- 34 to 80 +/- 32 IU/L, P = 0.02 and 2.23 +/- 2.71 to 1.78 +/- 2.38 x 10(7) copies/mL, P < 0.01 respectively), but no changes were observed in the control group. Serum HCV-RNA titres bound to LDL, as quantified by immunoprecipitation using anti-LDL antibody, also decreased in all 15 treated patients [5.55 +/- 6.59 to 1.07 +/- 1.58 x 10(6) copies/ml, P < 0.01 (mean reduction rate was -78.5 +/- 17.0%)]. Sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation study revealed that HCV-RNA-decreased density fractions after the bezafibrate were identical to LDL-density fractions (1.015-1.062 g/mL). Eight CHC patients were treated with bezafibrate, interferon, and ribavirin triple therapy for 32 weeks, and four patients achieved sustained virological response to therapy. This pilot study provides further evidence of an association between HCV and LDL in serum and suggests the potential usefulness of bezafibrate as an anti-HCV reagent for the treatment of CHC patients.
Myocardial dysfunction and coronary macro/microvascular alterations are the hallmarks of diabetic cardiomyopathy and are ascribed to increased oxidative stress and altered nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. We hypothesize that pre-treatment by cobalt-protoporphyrin IX (CoPP) ameliorates both myocardial function and coronary circulation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Isolated hearts from diabetic rats in Langendorff configuration displayed lower left ventricular function and higher coronary resistance (CR) compared to hearts from control animals. CoPP treatment of diabetic animals (0.3 mg/100 g body weight i.p., once a week for 3 weeks) significantly increased all the contractile/relaxation indexes (p < 0.01), while decreasing CR (p < 0.01). CoPP enhanced HO-1 protein levels and reduced oxidative stress in diabetic animals, as indicated by the significant (p < 0.05) decrease in heart % GSSG, [Formula: see text] and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. CoPP increased adiponectin levels and phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK and reversed the eNOS/iNOS expression imbalance observed in the untreated diabetic heart. Furthermore, after CoPP treatment, a rise in malonyl-CoA as well as a decrease in acetyl-CoA was observed in diabetic hearts. In this experimental model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, CoPP treatment improved both cardiac function and coronary flow by blunting oxidative stress, restoring eNOS/iNOS expression balance and increasing HO-1 levels, thereby favoring improvement in both endothelial function and insulin sensitivity.
Thrombolytic therapy is used in many cardiovascular diseases other than myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. In unstable angina, the results of trials have rather been disappointing. In prosthetic valve thrombosis, the role of thrombolytic therapy is increasing. In peripheral arterial thrombosis, intravenous thrombolysis was practically abandonned and local administration has been tried but no systematic attitude can be deduced. In cerebral arterial thrombosis intravenous alteplase thrombolytic treatment is effective and relatively safe in a well defined subgroup of stroke patients with moderate to severe neurologic deficit and without extended infarct signs on the initial CT scan.
To characterize the two forms of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, we examined renal function in the immediate and late postoperative periods after cardiac transplantation. Moderate azotemia occurred during the first postoperative week in 58% of 43 cyclosporine-treated recipients, but in only 34% of 41 azathioprine-treated recipients, and 4% of 25 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for nontransplant surgery (both P less than .01 v cyclosporine). Acute renal failure developed in an additional 12% of the cyclosporine-treated group. Late postoperative renal dysfunction also occurred with a high prevalence. Life-table analysis indicated that at 6 months 55%, at 12 months 17%, at 24 months 4%, and at 36 months no cyclosporine-treated recipients retained normal renal function. Three renal biopsies performed in subjects with late nephrotoxicity demonstrated prominent interstitial fibrosis. Although one patient subsequently required chronic dialysis, reduction of cyclosporine dosage from a mean of 5.3 +/- 0.7 mg/kg/d to a mean of 2.3 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/d 9 to 21 months after transplantation with concurrent initiation of azathioprine therapy to prevent rejection led to an improvement of renal function in the five patients so treated. These data indicate that there are two distinct forms of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Although both occur with high prevalence, the early form does not appear to be a specific risk factor for the late form.
Dyslipidaemia is a major risk factor in the development of atherosclerosis, and lipid lowering is achieved clinically using fibrate drugs and statins. Fibrate drugs are ligands for the fatty acid receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha, and the lipid-lowering effects of this class of drugs are mediated by the control of lipid metabolism, as directed by PPARalpha. PPARalpha ligands also mediate potentially protective changes in the expression of several proteins that are not involved in lipid metabolism, but are implicated in the pathogenesis of heart disease. Clinical studies with bezafibrate and gemfibrozil support the hypothesis that these drugs may have a significant protective effect against cardiovascular disease. The thiazolidinedione group of insulin-sensitising drugs are PPARgamma ligands, and these have beneficial effects on serum lipids in diabetic patients and have also been shown to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models. However, their efficacy in the prevention of cardiovascular-associated mortality has yet to be determined. Recent studies have found that PPARdelta is also a regulator of serum lipids. However, there are currently no drugs in clinical use that selectively activate this receptor. It is clear that all three forms of PPARs have mechanistically different modes of lipid lowering and that drugs currently available have not been optimised on the basis of PPAR biology. A new generation of rationally designed PPAR ligands may provide substantially improved drugs for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder with a prevalence of 1-2% in people over the age of 50. It has a world-wide distribution and has no gender preference. The neurological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies and is characterized by the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The causes of PD are unknown but considerable evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology involving genetic and environmental factors. A molecular genetic approach identified three genes and at least two additional loci in rare familial forms of PD. Two of these genes are involved in the ubiquitin mediated pathway of protein degradation and the third one is a highly expressed protein in the synaptic terminal and is called alpha-synuclein. In animal models, it has been shown that use of the household pesticide which is known to contain rotenone, causes PD. Thus, a combined action of genetic and environmental factors is responsible for the pathogenesis of PD. Although use of levodopa or dopamine agonists can substantially reduce clinical symptoms, and transplantation of fetal nerve tissue still remains as an alternative therapy (although it has been recently shown to be having no overall benefit), directed delivery of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (known to have trophic effects on dopaminergic neurons) may also be a beneficial therapeutic option for PD patients.
PC-1/PrLZ gene overexpression has been identified to be associated with prostate cancer progression. Previous studies have revealed that PC-1 possesses transforming activity and confers malignant phenotypes to mouse NIH3T3 cells. However, the functional relevance of PC-1 expression changes during prostate cancer development and progression remains to be evaluated. In this study, gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, respectively, were implemented. Experimental data showed that PC-1 expression was in positive correlation with prostate cancer cell growth and anchor-independent colony formation in vitro, as well as tumorigenicity in athymic BALB/c mice. Moreover, PC-1 expression was also found to promote androgen-independent progression and androgen antagonist Casodex resistance in prostate cancer cells. These results indicate that PC-1 contributes to androgen-independent progression and malignant phenotypes in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, molecular evidence revealed that PC-1 expression stimulated Akt/protein kinase B signaling pathway, which has been implicated to play important roles in promoting androgen refractory progression in prostate cancer. Increased PC-1 levels in C4-2 cells may represent an adaptive response in prostate cancer, mediating androgen-independent growth and malignant progression. Inhibiting PC-1 expression may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to delay prostate cancer progression.
Ototoxicity and general toxicity of cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (ii), a compound with antitumor activity, were evaluated in four rhesus monkeys. Audiometry was performed with shock avoidance to donditioned stimuli of pure tones at frequencies from 0.25 to 18 kHz. Histopathologic lesions of the inner ear were identified with phase-contrast microscopy of surface preparations from the organ of Corti. The monkeys were also submitted to physical examinations, hematologic and blood chemical determinations, necropsies, and histopathologic evaluations. Cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II) was injected intravenously in one monkey in five daily doses of 1.25 mg/kg (LD50) and in three monkeys in ten to 26 doses of 0.625 mg/kg five times per week. Transient hearing loss occurred in the monkey treated with the largest dose and in one of the three animals treated at the lower dose. In both monkeys apparently normal hearing reappeared after 120 and 200 days. No hearing loss was detectable in the other two animals. All four monkeys, however, had loss of hair cells in the organ of Corti and lesions were most severe among the outer hair cells of the lower turns. Other effects in all four monkeys included severe chronic glomerulonephritis with intermittent azotemia. Two monkeys (positive controls) injected intramuscularly with ten or 25 daily doses of neomycin sulfate (50 mg/kg) responded with delayed permanent hearing loss that appeared 3 months after the start of treatment. Deafness was substantiated by a total loss of inner hair cells in the upper turns, by a severe loss in the lower turns, and by a moderate or severe loss of outer hair cells in the lower turns. The above observations indicated that cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II), at a treatment regimen which caused more severe organ toxicity, caused less severe ototoxicity than neomycin sulfate and destroyed hair cells at different sites than neomycin sulfate.
A comparative study of Norinyl 1/35 and Brevicon was conducted at the APLAFA clinic in Panama City, Panama. The study sought to evaluate the differences in continuation rates and the frequency of selected side effects which might contribute to method discontinuation. The 300 subjects were randomly allocated to one of the two oral contraceptives. Women in the Brevicon group reported significantly more (p less than 0.05) intermenstrual bleeding, nausea, headaches, dizziness and vaginal discharge than women in the Norinyl 1/35 group. The total discontinuation rate at 12 months was 28.0 for the Norinyl 1/35 group and 46.7 for the Brevicon group, and this difference was significant (p less than .01). Also, significantly more women (p less than .01) in the Brevicon group discontinued for menstrual problems than women in the Norinyl 1/35 group. No pregnancies were reported during this study. While both oral contraceptives appear safe and effective, Norinyl 1/35 was more acceptable to this group of Panamanian women.
