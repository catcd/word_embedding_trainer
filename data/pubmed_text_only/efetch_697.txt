Bacillus thuringiensis strains C-4, C-9, GM-7, and GM-10, isolated from northeast Mexico and selected for their high toxicity against lepidopteran and coleopteran pests, were characterized following United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s guidelines. Flagellar serotyping revealed that GM-7 and GM-10 belonged to serotype aizawai, whereas C-4, C-9 corresponded to the kumamotoensis serotype. GM-10 and C-9 were also shown to be the most effective against lepidoptera and coleoptera larvae, respectively. None of the tested strains produced beta-exotoxin or showed activity against mosquitoes. GM-7 and GM-10 were sensitive to R-41 and CP-51 phages. All strains synthesized crystal proteins of 130-140 kDa. PCR analysis showed that C-4, GM-7, and GM-10 strains expressed cry1 genes, and C-9 expressed cry3 and cry7/8 genes, but not cry1. However, the C-9 strain had no cross-reaction with antisera raised against Cry3A and Cry7A proteins. GM-7 and GM-10 were sensitive to R-41 and CP-51 phages. When the delta-endotoxin (crystal) from the four strains was subcutaneously injected to Balb/c mice, alone or in combination with spores, only C-4 and C-9 provoked tissue necrosis similar to that caused by the beta-exotoxin producer HD-41. Tissue necrosis was prevented with the injection of pentoxifylline, an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production, suggesting a role of this cytokine in the observed effect. Our results demonstrated that GM-7 and GM-10 strains are effective and suitable for control of lepidopteran pests and safe for mammals under EPA regulations. The potential of the C-9 strain for the control of several coleopteran pests, and the induction of tissue necrosis in mice by C-4 and C-9 strains, are discussed.
Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is activated by oxidative stress such as that induced by transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). Whether NF-kappaB has a role in cell survival or death in stroke is a matter of debate. We proposed that the status of oxidative stress may determine its role in cell death or survival after focal ischemia. To characterize the coordinated expression of genes in NF-kappaB signaling after mild cerebral ischemia, we investigated the temporal profile of a NF-kappaB-pathway-focused DNA array after 30 mins of tFCI in wild-type (WT) mice and human copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase transgenic (SOD1 Tg) mice that had a significantly reduced level of superoxide. Differentially expressed genes among 96 NF-kappaB-related genes were further confirmed and compared in the WT and SOD1 Tg mice using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Persistent upregulation of NF-kappaB seen at 7 days in the WT mice was decreased in the SOD1 Tg mice. Lymphocytotrophic cytokine genes such as interleukin-2, interleukin-12, and interferon-alpha1 were increased in the SOD1 Tg mice compared with the WT mice after tFCI. In addition, antiapoptosis factors bcl-2 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 rapidly increased in the SOD1 Tg mice compared with the WT mice. This study indicates that reduced oxidative stress by SOD1 overexpression increased NF-kappaB-related rapid defenses, such as immune response and antiapoptosis factors, and prevented brain damage after tFCI-induced oxidative stress.
Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is thought to produce analgesic and possibly also antipruritic effects when applied topically. Capsaicin 0.05% was applied three times daily over a 5-day period to the same infrascapular region. The effects of the pretreatment upon the pruritogenic and wheal and flare reactions to subsequent histamine iontophoresis (20 mC) were evaluated on the following day. The antipruritic effects of the pretreatment were compared with the effects of placebo pretreatment and no pretreatment. Wheal and flare areas were evaluated planimetrically. Itch or pain were rated every minute over a 24-min period. The areas of alloknesis, i.e. the induction of perifocal itch sensation by usually nonitching (e.g. mechanical) stimuli, were also evaluated. In control subjects, but not in atopic eczema (AE) patients, capsaicin pretreatment significantly reduced the flare area. Compared with control subjects, AE patients showed a lack of alloknesis or significantly smaller areas of alloknesis in pretreated and nonpretreated skin. In control subjects, capsaicin pretreatment significantly reduced itch sensations compared with nonpretreated skin, whereas in AE patients no differences were seen. Itch sensations in capsaicin-pretreated skin were significantly lower in control subjects than in AE patients. We conclude that capsaicin does effectively suppress histamine-induced itching in healthy skin but has less effect in AE. The diminished itch sensations and the absence of alloknesis in atopic individuals indicate that histamine is not the key factor in itching in AE.
This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of zidovudine administered intravenously and orally to infants born to women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Thirty-two symptom-free infants were enrolled before 3 months of age. The pharmacokinetics of zidovudine were evaluated in each infant after single intravenously and orally administered doses of zidovudine on consecutive days, and during long-term oral administration of the drug for 4 to 6 weeks. As new patients were enrolled, doses of zidovudine were progressively increased from 2 to 4 mg/kg. Therapy was continued for up to 12 months in 7 of the infants proved to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Zidovudine was generally well tolerated; 20 children (62.5%) had anemia (hemoglobin level < 10.0 gm/dl) during therapy and 9 (28.1%) had neutropenia (neutrophil count < or = 750 cells/mm3); these hematologic abnormalities usually resolved spontaneously. The total body clearance of zidovudine increased significantly with age, from an average of 10.9 ml/min per kilogram in infants < or = 14 days of age to 19.0 ml/min per kilogram in older infants (p < 0.0001). Concurrently, there was a significant decrease in serum half-life from 3.12 hours in infants < or = 14 days to 1.87 hours in older infants (p = 0.0002). Oral absorption was satisfactory and bioavailability decreased significantly with age, from 89% in infants < or = 14 days to 61% in those > 14 days of age (p = 0.0002). Plasma concentrations of zidovudine were calculated to be in excess of 1 mumol/L (0.267 micrograms/ml) for 4.12 +/- 1.86 hours and 2.25 +/- 0.78 hours after oral doses of 2 mg/kg in infants younger than 2 weeks and 3 mg/kg in older infants, respectively. We conclude that zidovudine administered at oral doses of 2 mg/kg every 6 hours to infants aged less than 2 weeks and 3 mg/kg every 6 hours to infants older than 2 weeks resulted in plasma concentrations that are considered virustatic against human immunodeficiency virus. Zidovudine was well tolerated by infants at these doses.
The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that, in the presence of high circulating catecholamines, ACTH decreases renal excretory capability and that its natriuretic effects are caused by increased renal arterial pressure (RAP). In six conscious dogs, norepinephrine (NE, 0.4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) alone for 5 days caused a small but significant rise in arterial pressure (AP) from 102 +/- 6 to 115 +/- 8 mmHg. An infusion of ACTH (600 micrograms/day) for 7 days, superimposed upon the NE, caused a further rise in AP to a plateau of 143 +/- 9 mmHg after 5 days while cumulative sodium balance fell to -149 +/- 41 meq by the 7th day. Cumulative water balance fell to -660 +/- 232 ml by the 3rd day and then increased slightly. In contrast, when ACTH infusion was repeated during NE infusion while RAP was prevented from increasing using a servo-controlled aortic occluder, cumulative sodium balance increased to 197 +/- 35 meq and AP rose from 108 +/- 5 to 168 +/- 5 mmHg after 7 days and did not plateau. Cumulative water balance rose to 2,325 +/- 445 ml. Thus, in dogs receiving a background infusion of NE, ACTH causes moderate hypertension and natriuresis. However, when RAP is not allowed to rise, ACTH is associated with sodium retention and severe systemic hypertension, suggesting that the natriuretic effects of ACTH are caused by increased RAP and that the natriuresis blunts the chronic hypertensive effects of ACTH.
General toxicity and genetic materials damage of formaldehyde on germ cells in different stages was studied. In order to discover the toxicity mechanism of formaldehyde on germ cells and the biomarkers of effect after the presence of damage in germ cells and the estimation index, the relationships between the damage of germ cells and the MDA, SDH activity and Cu and Zn. in testicle tissue were investigated. Male mice exposed to formaldehyde by i.p. for 5 days. Formaldehyde doses were: 0.20 mg/kg, 2.00 mg/kg, 20.00 mg/kg. Mice were killed at the 6th day and the 14th day. HE staining was used to study the pathological changes happened in testicle tissue. In order to study the changes in sperm, the sperms and the abnormality of the sperm's heads were observed. In order to study the damage of the genetic material in the germ cells, the frequencies of sister chromosome exchanges and the frequencies of MN cells were studied. MDA was measured by MDA diagnosis box. Copper and zinc were determined by FAAS. US was used to determine the SDH activity in serum and testicle tissue. The results showed that: The main pathological changes in testicle tissue of formaldehyde groups were degeneration; The sperm quantity was decreased and the sperm heads deformation ratio was increased in all formaldehyde groups; There were a significant increase of MN ratio in early spermatogenic cells and SCE ratio in medial and high dose groups; The MDA in testicle tissue significant increased in high dose group. The SDH activity in testicle tissue was declined in all formaldehyde groups; There were a significant decline of copper and zinc in testicle tissue in high dose group. It is suggested that: Formaldehyde could induce genetic materials in spermatogone, primary spermatocyte and caused degeneration and necrosis in secondary spermatocyte, spermatogenic cell, sperm; The damage of LPO, decline of copper and zinc and SDH activity in mice's testicle tissue could be caused by formaldehyde; The effect of lipid peroxidation may be one of the toxicity mechanisms of formaldehyde on genetic materials; SDH is the biomarkers of effect after the toxicity effects induced by formaldehyde on germ cells appeared; Testing the sperm heads deformation ratio is the estimation index that can be used to judge the general toxicity of germ cells and the damage on their genetic materials of formaldehyde.
Most of the bone, cartilage and connective tissue of the lower jaw is derived from cranial neural crest cells (NCCs) arising from the posterior midbrain and hindbrain. Multiple factors direct the patterning of these NCCs, including endothelin-1-mediated endothelin A receptor (Edn1/Ednra) signaling. Loss of Ednra signaling results in multiple defects in lower jaw and neck structures, including homeotic transformation of lower jaw structures into upper jaw-like structures. However, since the Ednra gene is expressed by both migrating and post-migrating NCCs, the actual function of Ednra in cranial NCC development is not clear. Ednra signaling could be required for normal migration or guidance of NCCs to the pharyngeal arches or in subsequent events in post-migratory NCCs, including proliferation and survival. To address this question, we performed a fate analysis of cranial NCCs in Ednra-/- embryos using the R26R;Wnt1-Cre reporter system, in which Cre expression within NCCs results in permanent beta-galactosidase activity in NCCs and their derivatives. We find that loss of Ednra does not detectably alter either migration of most cranial NCCs into the mandibular first arch and second arch or their subsequent proliferation. However, mesenchymal cell apoptosis is increased two fold in both E9.5 and E10.5 Ednra-/- embryos, with apoptotic cells being present in and just proximal to the pharyngeal arches. Based on these studies, Ednra signaling appears to be required by most cranial NCCs after they reach the pharyngeal arches. However, a subset of NCCs appear to require Ednra signaling earlier, with loss of Ednra signaling likely leading to premature cessation of migration into or within the arches and subsequent cell death.
Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway has been implicated recently in the pathogenesis of leukemia. We studied the function of epigenetic regulation of the Wnt pathway and its prognostic relevance in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We used a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction approach to analyze the promoter methylation status of a panel of Wnt antagonists including sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP4, sFRP5, DKK1 and DKK3. Aberrant methylation of Wnt antagonists was detected in four AML cell lines and in up to 64% of AML marrow samples. Treatment of the cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced reexpression of methylated Wnt antagonists and inactivation of the Wnt pathway by downregulating the Wnt pathway genes cyclin D1, TCF1 and LEF1 and reducing nuclear localization of beta-catenin. In a subgroup of patients 60 years and younger with newly diagnosed AML and intermediate-risk cytogenetics, abnormal methylation of Wnt antagonists was associated with decreased 4-year relapse-free survival (28 vs 61%, respectively, P=0.03). Our results indicate a function of the epigenetic regulation of the Wnt pathway in predicting relapse in a subgroup of AML patients.
Potential risk factors responsible for development of doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure were examined through retrospective analysis of 4018 patient records. The overall incidence of drug-induced congestive heart failure was 2.2% (88 cases). The probability of incurring doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure was related to the total dose of doxorubicin administered. There was a continuum of increasing risk as the cumulative amount of administered drug increased. A weekly dose schedule of doxorubicin was associated with a significantly lower incidence of congestive heart failure than was the usually employed every 3-week schedule. An increase in drug-related congestive heart failure was also seen with advancing patient age. Performance status, sex, race, and tumor type were not risk factors. These data will enable clinicians to better estimate the risk/benefit ratio in individual patients receiving prolonged administration of doxorubicin. They also provide a basis for the investigation of less cardiotoxic anthracycline analogues or for designing measures to prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
We report the first case of lethal intracranial haemorrhage complicating a treatment by rt-PA in a patient presenting with a simultaneous staphylococcal septicemia with meningoencephalitis and an acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. The presence of microvascular lesions in the central nervous system seems to be important risk factor for intracranial haemorrhage and we recommend extreme caution in the use of thrombolytic treatment in septicemic patients with acute myocardial infarction, particularly when neurological symptoms are present.
Effect of carvedilol on lipid peroxidation was investigated in patients with stable angina. The study comprised 30 patients (20 men and 10 women), aged 38-55 years (mean 48.3 years) with stable angina. The patients were administered carvedilol in increasing every four weeks doses: 12.5 mg/day, 25 mg/day, 50 mg/day. The control group consisted of 12 healthy subjects aged 39-49 years (mean 45.7 years). Blood samples were collected before and 4,8 and 12 weeks after therapy in patients and once in control group. Our study has been approved by the local Ethics Committee. MDA concentration in plasma and erythrocytes, which is a recognised indicator of tissue injury caused by reactive oxygen species, was measured according to Placer et al. MDA concentration was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with stable angina than in control group. After 4, 8 and 12 weeks of carvedilol therapy, decrease in MDA concentration was observed in comparison to the initial values. MDA concentration did not differ in patients from that observed in healthy subjects after 8 and 12 weeks of therapy The results of our study have shown that carvedilol inhibits lipid peroxidation in patients with stable angina.
Azelaic acid (AZA) has been used successfully in the treatment of lentigo maligna melanoma. Since it is generally accepted that the fibrinolytic potential of tumour cells is related to their malignant phenotype, it was the aim of this study to investigate the effect of AZA on the fibrinolytic potential of three different human melanoma cell lines (Bowes, GUBSB and MJZJ). Melanoma cells were incubated with AZA in doses ranging from 10(-2) M to 4 x 10(-2) M for 5, 8 and 24 h. The expression of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase-type PA (u-PA) and PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in such treated cells was investigated by specific ELISAs on the protein level and by Northern blotting on the mRNA level. AZA caused a time and dose dependent decrease in the fibrinolytic potential of all three cell lines investigated by decreasing t-PA antigen in Bowes, by decreasing u-PA antigen in GUBSB and by increasing PAI-1 antigen in MJZJ cells, respectively. There was no significant difference between the viability of cells in control cultures and those treated with AZA. The effect of AZA on specific mRNA for t-PA in Bowes cells, u-PA in GUBSB and PAI-1 in MJZJ was consistent with its effect on the secretion of these fibrinolytic proteins by the respective cells. The results show that AZA decreases the fibrinolytic potential of the three human melanoma cell lines in vitro. This decrease may be operative in the mechanism by which AZA has been shown to affect malignant melanoma in vivo.
We studied calcitriol metabolism in white patients with chronic renal failure and in age- and sex-matched normal subjects. The plasma levels of calcitriol (21.9 +/- 1.6 pg/mL, n = 7, v control, 37.4 +/- 2.9 pg/mL, P less than 0.001), metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of calcitriol (0.45 +/- .01 mL/min/kg v control, 0.58 +/- .02 mL/min/kg, P less than 0.001), and production rate (PR) of calcitriol (14.2 +/- 1.0 ng/kg/d v control, 31.8 +/- 3.2 ng/kg/d, P less than 0.001) were significantly lower in patients with moderate renal failure (average creatinine clearance, 0.59 +/- 0.01 mL/s [35.1 +/- 6.1 mL/min]) when compared with the respective values of normal control subjects. The MCR of calcitriol was determined again in patients with renal failure after they received calcitriol, 1 microgram/d, for 1 week. The MCR remained unchanged (0.46 +/- .04 mL/min/kg, n = 7) and plasma levels of calcitriol were increased to 34.6 +/- 2.77 pg/mL. The mechanism by which the MCR of calcitriol decreases in renal failure is partly due to the presence of inhibitory factors of degradation enzymes in uremic plasma. When the ultrafiltrates of uremic plasma obtained from hemodialysis patients were infused to normal Sprague-Dawley rats, the MCRs of calcitriol (0.20 +/- .01 mL/min/kg, n = 6) were markedly suppressed in comparison to those of rats infused with the ultrafiltrates of normal plasma (0.37 +/- .01 mL/min/kg, n = 6, P less than 0.001). The uremic plasma also contained factors that inhibit the synthesis of calcitriol. We conclude that metabolic degradation of calcitriol is decreased in patients with renal failure, and uremic plasma contains inhibitory factors that suppress the synthesis and degradation of calcitriol.
Heparin is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patients. Recently, a number of commercial lots of heparin products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) derivative that could elicit a hypotensive response in pigs following a single high-dose infusion. Using both contaminated heparin products and the synthetically produced derivative, we showed that the OSCS produces dose-dependent hypotension in pigs. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1mg/kg, corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3%. We also demonstrated that OSCS can be identified in heparin products using a simple, inexpensive, commercially available heparin enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit that has a limit of detection of approximately 0.1%, well below the NOEL. This kit may provide a useful method to test heparin products for contamination with oversulfated GAG derivatives.
We encountered a renal transplant recipient who developed an unexplained 0.09 decrease in hematocrit value while taking enalapril for hypertension, which reversed when the drug was stopped. This experience, and a previous similar case report, prompted a review of all our 27 transplant patients treated with enalapril. Of these, 10 patients (37%) had developed an otherwise unaccounted for anemia: the pre-enalapril hematocrit value was 0.42 +/- 0.01 and it decreased to the nadir value of 0.33 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001) within 12.3 +/- 0.9 weeks after initiation of 9 +/- 2.4 mg of enalapril daily; enalapril was stopped in seven patients and their anemia resolved within 9.1 +/- 0.7 weeks to a final hematocrit value of 0.40 +/- 0.01. The remaining three patients were maintained on enalapril at their physicians' discretion, without further decrease in hematocrit values. No appreciable changes in drug regimens, clinical course, or other laboratory parameters were noted during this period. A causal relationship between enalapril and anemia was suggested by the effect of drug withdrawal and rechallenge on hematocrit in one of the patients. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics between those patients who did (group I) and those who did not (group II) develop enalapril-associated anemia, with the exception of a normal hematocrit value of 0.42 +/- 0.01 in group I versus a lower hematocrit value of 0.36 +/- 0.02 in group II (P less than 0.05). We conclude that enalapril should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia following renal transplantation. Susceptibility to this effect might emanate from the immunosuppressed state.
Methotrexate (MTX) treatment at high doses may cause renal failure. The effects of treatment with low MTX doses on kidney function are, however, unknown. The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of low MTX doses on kidney function.
The glomerular filtration rate was measured as the plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA and the clearance of 99mTc-dimercaptoacetyl-triglycine (correction of triglycerine) (99mTc-MAG3), a new renal tubular function agent, was used to measure tubular effects of MTX.
Significant decrease of both 51Cr-EDTA clearance from 92 +/- 7 to 83 +/- 5 ml/min x 1.73 m2 (mean +/- SEM) and of the 99mTc-MAG3 clearance from 360 +/- 18 to 309 +/- 15 ml/min x 1.73 m2 (p < 0.05) was observed.
Our results indicate that low dose MTX treatment (15 mg weekly) may significantly impair kidney function which has to be considered particularly in situations with combined treatment with other potentially nephrotoxic substances.
In this article, we demonstrate the expression of functional progesterone binding sites at the cell membrane in murine mammary carcinomas that are stimulated by progestins and inhibited by antiprogestins. Using confocal immunofluorescence, ligand binding and cell compartment-specific western blots, we were able to identify the presence of the classical progesterone receptors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and RU-486 (1 × 10(-11) and 1 × 10(-8) M) behaved as agonists activating extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and progestin-regulated proteins, except for Cyclin D1 and Tissue factor which failed to increase with 1 × 10(-8) M RU-486, an experimental condition that allows PR to bind DNA. These results predicted a full agonist effect at low concentrations of RU-486. Accordingly, at concentrations lower than 1 × 10(-11) M, RU-486 increased cell proliferation in vitro. This effect was abolished by incubation with the ERK kinase inhibitor PD 98059 or by OH-tamoxifen. In vivo, at a daily dose of 1.2 μg/kg body weight RU-486 increased tumor growth, whereas at 12 mg/kg induces tumor regression. Our results indicate that low concentrations of MPA and RU-486 induce similar agonistic non-genomic effects, whereas RU-486 at higher concentrations may inhibit cell proliferation by genomic-induced effects. This suggests that RU-486 should be therapeutically administered at doses high enough to guarantee its genomic inhibitory effect.
