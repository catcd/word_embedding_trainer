The ontogeny of functional sympathetic neural, adrenal medullary, and extra-adrenal components of adrenergic control of heart rate was examined in neonatal rats using a combination of pharmacological and surgical approaches. In the first experiment, bradycardia (-54 beat/min) was observed in unrestrained 2-day Sprague-Dawley rat pups 2.5 h after treatment with the adrenergic neuron blocking agent bretylium tosylate, indicating that sympathetic neural control of basal heart rate is functional in newborn rats. (Two additional experiments examined the possibility that bretylium reduced heart rate through a nonspecific cardiodepressant action.) Heart rate decreased further after administration of the ganglionic blocking agent hexamethonium to 2-, 5-, 8-, and 24-day pups pretreated with bretylium and methylatropine, indicating that neurally controlled release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla contributes to maintenance of basal heart rate in preweanling rats. In pups pretreated with bretylium, methylatropine, and hexamethonium, additional bradycardia was observed after administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent atenolol, suggesting that circulating catecholamines from extra-adrenal sources (e.g., organ of Zuckerkandl) are important in control of heart rate during the neonatal period. A second experiment using adrenalectomized 2-, 8-, and 24-day rats confirmed the relative contribution of adrenal catecholamines to sympathetic control of neonatal heart rate. These results suggest that sympathetic innervation of both the heart and adrenal exerts significant functional control of cardiac rate in newborn rats. Circulating catecholamines released from extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue may also provide significant adrenergic stimulation to the heart during the neonatal period.
A case of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES) observed during a 120-h infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is presented. This syndrome has been described in the literature after protracted infusion chemotherapy of over 30 days. The agent most frequently associated with this syndrome was 5-FU. A 53-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the retromolar trigone. The patient received 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin on day 1 and 120-h continuous infusion of 1000 mg/m2 of 5-FU every 3 weeks. After the second course, the patient developed clinical features consistent with PPES. This side effect has not been previously reported with short-term (5-day or 120-h) continuous infusion of 5-FU. Less frequently, the syndrome has also been described with 10-day continuous infusion. The etiopathogenesis of PPES is unclear, but it seems to be dose-dependent and probably related to cutaneous drug accumulation.
Neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (DH) die of pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension. We used immunohistochemical localization of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1, thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1, surfactant protein (SP) A, SP-C, and competitive RT-PCR quantitation of TTF-1, SP-A, SP-C, and alpha-SMA mRNA expression to characterize the epithelial and vascular phenotype of lungs from ICR fetal mice with a nitrofen-induced DH. Nitrofen (25 mg) was gavage fed to pregnant mice on day 8 of gestation. Fetal mice were delivered on day 17. The diaphragm was examined for a defect, and the lungs were either fixed, sectioned, and immunostained or processed for mRNA isolation. In comparison with control lungs, DH lungs showed increased expression of alpha-SMA mRNA, fewer and more muscular arterioles (alpha-SMA), less well-developed capillary networks (PECAM-1), delayed epithelial development marked by a persistence of TTF-1 in the periphery, and decreased SP-A mRNA and SP-A expression. These data suggest that in the murine nitrofen-induced DH, as in human congenital DH, pulmonary insufficiency is due to an inhibition of peripheral pulmonary development including terminal airway and vascular morphogenesis.
Although thalidomide (Thd) is being extensively investigated for its effects on cytokine production and T cell costimulation, it is poorly understood whether it is capable of modulating the activities of natural killer (NK) cells. In this study, Thd effects on NK cell activity were examined with a murine model of melanoma, which is mostly rejected by NK cell-dependent mechanism. Administration of Thd significantly (p<0.01 on Day 21) suppressed the growth of subcutaneous B16F1 melanoma. In Thd-treated mice, marked splenomegaly and augmented splenocyte count were observed. Additionally, the percentage of splenic NK1.1+ cells was elevated to approximately 2.5-fold within 10 days after Thd treatment. The expression of interferon inducible protein (IP)-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18 was remarkably upregulated. Production of the cytotoxic molecule perforin was also augmented. These data suggest that Thd strongly activates NK cell activity in mice, possibly resulting in enhanced tumor surveillance defense.
The treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with documented cocaine abuse has always presented significant challenges. Issues related to medication compliance, the potential risks of beta adrenergic blockade, and possible continued cocaine abuse postmyocardial infarction necessitate a unique, individualized approach to these patients. Recent data in the era of extensive percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and intracoronary stent (ICS) implantation have raised questions regarding the safety of ICS in patients who may revert to cocaine abuse postacute coronary syndrome as a result of the potentially higher risk of stent thrombosis in these patients. While the precise reason as to why cocaine use may increase the risk of stent thrombosis is not fully understood, it is likely the result of a confluence of factors, including coronary vessel vasoconstriction, impaired vascular compliance, as well as the platelet-activating effect of cocaine. We present the case a 46-year-old male with a history of cocaine abuse who presented with an acute stent thrombosis 2 days post-PCI likely as a result of cocaine abuse on the day of discharge following initial stent implantation for a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). We also review the literature regarding the safety of PCI in cocaine abusers.
The precise molecular mechanism of Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy (ADR-CM) is still unknown. We address the demonstration of apoptotic myocardial cell death and the apoptosis-inducing molecules in ADR-CM induced in rats.
Until 8 weeks after the first administration of ADR, there was no increase in the number of labeled cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay (TUNEL method). Apoptotic indices increased significantly at weeks 9 and 10 in hearts of the ADR-treated group but not in those of the control group (0.42+/-0.12% versus 0.10+/-0.02% and 0.86+/-0.11% versus 0.09+/-0.04% at weeks 9 and 10, respectively). DNA ladder formation was also observed in the myocardial tissues during the late stages of the ADR-CM of rats. There was no significant difference in expression of p53 gene between the ADR group and the control group at either the message or the protein level. An overexpression of Fas antigen was shown in myocardial cells of ADR-treated hearts at weeks 9 and 10 by both Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Furthermore, we confirmed that neutralization of anti-Fas ligand antibody inhibited ADR-induced apoptosis.
Apoptotic cell death was observed in the hearts of ADR-CM rats, and the number of apoptotic myocardial cells increased with the deterioration of morphological findings and cardiac function, indicating that apoptosis may be an important mechanism of loss of myocardial cells and cardiac dysfunction in ADR-CM. Apoptosis in ADR-CM rats is not p53-dependent but rather is executed through a Fas-mediated pathway.
Reduced activity of ferrochelatase in erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) results in protoporphyrin (PP) accumulation in erythrocytes and liver. Liver disease may occur in patients with EPP, some of whom develop progressive liver failure that necessitates transplantation. We investigated the mechanisms underlying EPP-associated liver disease in a mouse model of EPP.
Liver histology, indicators of lipid peroxidation, plasma parameters of liver function, and bile composition were studied in mice homozygous (fch/fch) for a point mutation in the ferrochelatase gene and in heterozygous (fch/+) and wild-type (+/+) mice.
Microscopic examination showed bile duct proliferation and biliary fibrosis with portoportal bridging in fch/fch mice. PP content was 130-fold increased, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (+30%) and conjugated dienes (+75%) were slightly higher in fch/fch than in fch/+ and +/+ livers. Levels of hepatic thiols (-12%) and iron (-52%) were reduced in fch/fch livers. Liver enzymes and plasma bilirubin were markedly increased in the homozygotes. Plasma bile salt levels were 80 times higher in fch/fch than in fch/+ and +/+ mice, probably related to the absence of the Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting protein (Ntcp) in fch/fch liver. Paradoxically, bile flow was not impaired and biliary bile salt secretion was 4 times higher in fch/fch mice than in controls. Up-regulation of the intestinal Na(+)-dependent bile salt transport system in fch/fch mice may enhance efficiency of bile salt reabsorption. The bile salt/lipid ratio and PP content of fch/fch bile were increased 2-fold and 85-fold, respectively, compared with +/+, whereas biliary glutathione was reduced by 90%. Similar effects on bile formation were caused by griseofulvin-induced inhibition of ferrochelatase activity in control mice.
Bile formation is strongly affected in mice with impaired ferrochelatase activity. Rather than peroxidative processes, formation of cytotoxic bile with high concentrations of bile salts and PP may cause biliary fibrosis in fch/fch mice by damaging bile duct epithelium.
Melanoma rates continue to increase; however, few risk factors other than sun sensitivity and ultraviolet radiation (including sun exposure) have been identified. Although studies of farmers have shown an excess risk of melanoma and other skin cancers, it is unclear how much of this is related to sun exposure compared with other agricultural exposures.
We examined dose-response relationships for 50 agricultural pesticides and cutaneous melanoma incidence in the Agricultural Health Study cohort of licensed pesticide applicators, along with ever use of older pesticides that contain arsenic. Logistic regression was used to examine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with pesticide exposure adjusted for age, sex, and other potential confounders.
We found significant associations between cutaneous melanoma and maneb/mancozeb (>or= 63 exposure days: OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.9; trend p = 0.006), parathion (>or= 56 exposure days: OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4; trend p = 0.003), and carbaryl (>or= 56 exposure days: OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5; trend p = 0.013). Other associations with benomyl and ever use of arsenical pesticides were also suggested.
Most previous melanoma literature has focused on host factors and sun exposure. Our research shows an association between several pesticides and melanoma, providing support for the hypotheses that agricultural chemicals may be another important source of melanoma risk.
Development of the frontonasal mass (FNM), branchial arches, heart, and limbs depends on neural crest-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal (E-M) interactions. Teratogenesis by retinoic acid (RA) or blockade of serotonergic (5-HT) signaling by the pan-5-HT(2) receptor antagonist, ritanserin, perturbs development of these embryonic structures. In both cases, resulting phenotypes include forebrain and olfactory placode anomalies, malformations of the face, eye and lens, as well as posterior neural tube and cardiac defects. Similar sites of malformations, together with the presence of RA response elements in the 5-HT(2B) receptor promoter, have led to the suggestion that a negative regulatory relationship may exist between RA and 5-HT(2)-mediated 5-HT signaling at sites of E-M interaction (Choi et al. 1997); however, another possibility is that RA and 5-HT act independently as opposing signals to regulate development of common embryonic targets. Together with recent evidence for opposite effects on chondrogenic differentiation in hindlimb micromass cultures (Bhasin et al. 2003a), results of the present study raise the possibility that these pathways may act as opposing signals for common targets in the mouse embryo. The RA receptors, co-factors and metabolic enzymes, and 5-HT(2B) receptors were found to be are coordinately expressed at sites of E-M interaction, including the FNM, in the embryonic day (E)10.5 mouse. Cell proliferation experiments using [(3)H]thymidine incorporation demonstrated that RA or activation of 5-HT(2B) receptors caused opposite effects in FNM explants, namely stimulation or inhibition of cell proliferation, respectively, 5-HT(2B) receptor activation did not appreciably alter patterning in FNM explants. While RA has been shown to regulate lateral patterning in the FNM (LaMantia et al. 2000), 5-HT(2B) receptor activation did not alter patterning in FNM explants. Quantification of 5-HT(2B) receptor transcripts by real-time PCR provided no evidence of negative regulation of 5-HT(2B) receptor expression by RA in FNM explants, although preliminary studies using in situ hybridization had suggested that this was a possibility in both explants and RA teratogenized embryos. Future studies using quantitative PCR may still show this to be the case in teratogenized embryos. Together with the finding of coordinate expression of 5-HT(2B )receptors and RA signaling molecules, results of the present study suggest that RA, and 5-HT mediated by 5-HT(2B )receptors, may act as opposing signals to regulate cell proliferation during craniofacial development in the mouse embryo.
Spatial analyses of case-control data have suggested a possible link between breast cancer and groundwater plumes in upper Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
We integrated residential histories, public water distribution systems, and groundwater modeling within geographic information systems (GIS) to examine the association between exposure to drinking water that has been contaminated by wastewater effluent and breast cancer.
Exposure was assessed from 1947 to 1993 for 638 breast cancer cases who were diagnosed from 1983 to 1993 and 842 controls; we took into account residential mobility and drinking water source. To estimate the historical impact of effluent on drinking water wells, we modified a modular three-dimensional finite-difference groundwater model (MODFLOW) from the U.S. Geological Survey. The analyses included latency and exposure duration.
Wastewater effluent impacted the drinking water wells of study participants as early as 1966. For > 0-5 years of exposure (versus no exposure), associations were generally null. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for > 10 years of exposure were slightly increased, assuming latency periods of 0 or 10 years [AOR = 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-1.9 and AOR = 1.6; 95% CI, 0.8-3.2, respectively]. Statistically significant associations were estimated for ever-exposed versus never-exposed women when a 20-year latency period was assumed (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.4). A sensitivity analysis that classified exposures assuming lower well-pumping rates showed similar results.
We investigated the hypothesis generated by earlier spatial analyses that exposure to drinking water contaminated by wastewater effluent may be associated with breast cancer. Using a detailed exposure assessment, we found an association with breast cancer that increased with longer latency and greater exposure duration.
A 53-year-old man and a 76-year-old woman were treated with the cytotoxic drug capecitabine as palliative treatment and adjuvant treatment, respectively, because of colorectal carcinoma. Both developed myocardial ischaemia within a few days. In the man, the capecitabine dosage was reduced and metoprolol was prescribed, while in the woman the capecitabine was stopped. According to the literature, the risk of myocardial ischaemia during treatment with capecitabine is approximately 0.4%, irrespective of the patient's medical history. Except in clinical trials, a history of coronary disease is not considered a contraindication for capecitabine treatment. In case stable angina pectoris develops during treatment, continuation of treatment with a reduced dosage of capecitabine can be considered. A switch to treatment with an alternative fluoropyrimidine, such as fluorouracil or raltitrexed, also appears to be safe. However, raltitrexed is no longer available in The Netherlands.
To identify genetic susceptibility loci for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a genome-wide association study was performed using 464,328 autosomal SNPs in 1,583 NPC affected individuals (cases) and 1,894 controls of southern Chinese descent. The top 49 SNPs from the genome-wide association study were genotyped in 3,507 cases and 3,063 controls of southern Chinese descent from Guangdong and Guangxi. The seven supportive SNPs were further confirmed by transmission disequilibrium test analysis in 279 trios from Guangdong. We identified three new susceptibility loci, TNFRSF19 on 13q12 (rs9510787, Pcombined=1.53x10(-9), odds ratio (OR)=1.20), MDS1-EVI1 on 3q26 (rs6774494, Pcombined=1.34x10(-8), OR=0.84) and the CDKN2A-CDKN2B gene cluster on 9p21 (rs1412829, Pcombined=4.84x10(-7), OR=0.78). Furthermore, we confirmed the role of HLA by revealing independent associations at rs2860580 (Pcombined=4.88x10(-67), OR=0.58), rs2894207 (Pcombined=3.42x10(-33), OR=0.61) and rs28421666 (Pcombined=2.49x10(-18), OR=0.67). Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of NPC by highlighting the involvement of pathways related to TNFRSF19 and MDS1-EVI1 in addition to HLA molecules.
Isoniazid and pyrazinamide are well-known hepatotoxic drugs, often used in combination. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic influence of pyrazinamide on the outcome of fulminant or subfulminant liver failure caused by antituberculous therapy. Eighteen patients with fulminant or subfulminant liver failure due to antituberculous therapy were studied. Nine patients received isoniazid and rifampicin without pyrazinamide (group 1), and nine patients received isoniazid and rifampicin together with pyrazinamide (group 2). The severity of fulminant and subfulminant liver failure, as judged by the prevalence of coma and the lowest level of factor V, was similar in the two groups. Spontaneous survival was greater in group 1 (eight of nine) than in group 2 (two of nine) (P < .02). The authors conclude that pyrazinamide co-administration was associated with an increased mortality in patients with fulminant or subfulminant hepatitis occurring during antituberculous therapy. In these patients, pyrazinamide administration and an interval of more than 15 days between the onset of antituberculous treatment and jaundice, combined with grade III encephalopathy and factor V below 20%, predicted death without liver transplantation.
Dopamine (DA) has been implicated as an endogenous neurotoxin to explain selective neurodegeneration, as observed for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, previous work demonstrated that 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) was more toxic than DA. DOPAL is generated as a part of DA catabolism via the activity of monoamine oxidase, and the mechanism of DOPAL toxicity is proposed to involve protein modification. Previous studies have demonstrated protein reactivity via the aldehyde moiety; however, DOPAL contains two reactive functional groups (catechol and aldehyde), both with the potential for protein adduction. The goal of this work was to determine whether protein modification by DOPAL occurs via a thiol-reactive quinone generated from oxidation of the catechol, which is known to occur for DA, or if the aldehyde forms adducts with amine nucleophiles. To accomplish this objective, the reactivity of DOPAL toward N-acetyl-lysine (NAL), N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), and two model proteins was determined. In addition, several DOPAL analogues were obtained and used for comparison of reactivity. Results demonstrate that at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C, the order of DOPAL reactivity is NAL > NAC and the product of NAL and DOPAL is stable in the absence of reducing agent. Moreover, DOPAL will react with model proteins, but in the presence of amine-selective modifiers citraconic anhydride and 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride, the reactivity of DOPAL toward the proteins is diminished. In addition, DOPAL-mediated protein cross-linking is observed when a model protein or a protein mixture (i.e., mitochondria lysate) is treated with DOPAL at concentrations of 5-100 microM. Protein cross-linking was diminished in the presence of ascorbate, suggesting the involvement of a quinone in DOPAL-mediated protein modification. These data indicate that DOPAL is highly reactive toward protein nucleophiles with the potential for protein cross-linking.
Cardiotoxicity is a recognized complication of doxorubicin therapy, but the long-term effects of doxorubicin are not well documented. We therefore assessed the cardiac status of 115 children who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with doxorubicin 1 to 15 years earlier in whom the disease was in continuous remission.
Eighteen patients received one dose of doxorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area), and 97 received multiple doses totaling 228 to 550 mg per square meter (median, 360). The median interval between the end of treatment and the cardiac evaluation was 6.4 years. Our evaluation consisted of a history, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, and echocardiography.
Fifty-seven percent of the patients had abnormalities of left ventricular afterload (measured as end-systolic wall stress) or contractility (measured as the stress-velocity index). The cumulative dose of doxorubicin was the most significant predictor of abnormal cardiac function (P less than 0.002). Seventeen percent of patients who received one dose of doxorubicin had slightly elevated age-adjusted afterload, and none had decreased contractility. In contrast, 65 percent of patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter had increased afterload (59 percent of patients), decreased contractility (23 percent), or both. Increased afterload was due to reduced ventricular wall thickness, not to hypertension or ventricular dilatation. In multivariate analyses restricted to patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, the only significant predictive factors were a higher cumulative dose (P = 0.01), which predicted decreased contractility, and an age of less than four years at treatment (P = 0.003), which predicted increased afterload. Afterload increased progressively in 24 of 34 patients evaluated serially (71 percent). Reported symptoms correlated poorly with indexes of exercise tolerance or ventricular function. Eleven patients had congestive heart failure within one year of treatment with doxorubicin; five of them had recurrent heart failure 3.7 to 10.3 years after completing doxorubicin treatment, and two required heart transplantation. No patient had late heart failure as a new event.
Doxorubicin therapy in childhood impairs myocardial growth in a dose-related fashion and results in a progressive increase in left ventricular afterload sometimes accompanied by reduced contractility. We hypothesize that the loss of myocytes during doxorubicin therapy in childhood might result in inadequate left ventricular mass and clinically important heart disease in later years.
We report the case of a 10 year-old girl who had Stevens-Johnson syndrome and cholestasis after ibuprofen therapy. Liver histology was compatible with vanishing bile duct syndrome. She received ursodeoxycholic acid, and liver tests normalized within 7 months. This report confirms that ibuprofen may induce acute vanishing bile duct syndrome.
In a rheumatism clinic study in Brisbane, the consumption of aspirin and phenacetin compounds (APC) containing more than one kilogram of aspirin and phenacetin was significantly associated with overt renal papillary necrosis (RPN) and with a renal score, but when more than one kilogram of aspirin was taken without phenacetin there was no such association. Analysis and comparison with the parallel New Zealand study showed an overall risk of RPN of at least 10-6% when more than one kilogram of aspirin was taken in APC form, and 0-3% when aspirin was taken without phenacetin. An additive interaction of phenacetin and aspirin is postulated. It is concluded that phenacetin use should be severely restricted.
Sulfated portions of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains in heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) are thought to play an important role in charge-dependent selectivity of glomerular filtration against plasma proteins. Heparan sulfate N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate: unsubstituted glucosamine N-sulfotransferase (NDST) is the key enzyme regulating sulfation of GAG chains. In this study we investigated transcriptional expression of NDST-1, 1 of 4 isozymes of NDST, in glomeruli of rats with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis. Nephrosis was induced in rats with a single intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg PAN. On days 10 and 35, expression of NDST-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in glomeruli was analyzed with the use of Northern-blot analysis. Immunohistochemical studies were also performed with the use of monoclonal antibodies that react specifically with the N-sulfated portion of the GAG chain of HSPG and agrin, a major core protein of HSPG in glomerular basement membrane (GBM). In addition, we studied the expression of NDST-1 mRNA in cultured glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) and glomerular mesangial cells in the presence of PAN. On day 10, when significant proteinuria developed, the ratios of glomerular expression of NDST-1 mRNA against glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in PAN-treated rats were decreased to 48% +/- 6% of those in controls (P<.05). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that staining for N-sulfated GAG chains of HSPG on GBM was markedly reduced on day 10 in PAN-treated rats but that staining for agrin was unchanged. In contrast, on day 35, when PAN-treated rats recovered from proteinuria, we noted no differences in glomerular expression of NDST-1 mRNA and staining intensity for N-sulfated GAG chains on GBM between PAN-treated rats and controls. Incubation of GECs for 24 hours in the presence of 50 ng/mL PAN resulted in the reduction of the expression of NDST-1 mRNA (67% +/- 12% of those in controls, P<.05). In summary, we found alteration of the expression of NDST-1 mRNA, accompanying a loss of N-sulfated GAG chains of HSPG on GBM without changes in the core protein agrin, in the course of PAN nephrosis. These data suggest an important role for this enzyme in heparan sulfate assembly in GBM and GEC and in the pathogenesis of proteinuria in PAN nephrosis.
Although vasodilators improve cardiac output in severe left ventricular (LV) failure, the degree to which reduction in mitral regurgitation (MR) contributes to this response is unknown. In the present study, nitroprusside-induced changes in forward cardiac output were compared with simultaneous radionuclide LV output in 14 patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction in the absence of known primary valvular disease. Regurgitant output was estimated as LV output minus forward output and regurgitant fraction was calculated as regurgitant output/LV output. At rest, LV ejection fraction averaged 0.16 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- standard deviation). Patients were classified into 2 groups based on regurgitant fraction at rest. Group I (n = 5) had little or no detectable valvular regurgitation, with regurgitant fraction less than 0.10; group II (n = 9) had evidence of MR with regurgitant fraction greater than 0.30. Nitroprusside increased forward cardiac output in all patients in both groups, but this effect was significantly greater in group II (64 +/- 34%) than in group I (31 +/- 17%) (p less than 0.01). Nitroprusside decreased regurgitant fraction in all group II patients, with mean regurgitant fraction decreasing from 0.44 +/- 0.12 to 0.26 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.005). Thus, a large percentage of patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction have clinically relevant MR, defined as a regurgitant fraction greater than 0.30. Nitroprusside has a greater effect on forward cardiac output in patients with LV failure and MR than in patients with comparable ventricular dysfunction in the absence of detectable MR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
We report the cases of two women who began to experience urinary hesitancy and retention after starting treatment with sertraline for depression. Discontinuation of the drug resulted in complete symptom relief. Serotonergic neurons are involved at several levels in control of the lower urinary tract. Retention is apparently an uncommon complication of sertraline. Discontinuation should be considered for patients presenting with voiding difficulties.
Cholinesterase inhibitor-based reversal agents, given in the absence of neuromuscular block, evoke a partial upper airway obstruction by decreasing skeletal upper airway muscle function. Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular block by encapsulating rocuronium. However, its effects on upper airway integrity and breathing are unknown.
Fifty-one adult male rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane, tracheostomized, and a femoral artery and vein were cannulated. First, we compared the efficacy of sugammadex 15 mg kg(-1) and neostigmine 0.06 mg kg(-1) to reverse respiratory effects of rocuronium-induced partial paralysis [train-of-four ratio (T4/T1)=0.5]. Subsequently, we compared the safety of sugammadex and neostigmine given after recovery of the T4/T1 to 1, by measuring phasic genioglossus activity and breathing.
During partial paralysis (T4/T1=0.5), time to recovery of minute volume to baseline values was 10.9 (2), 75.8 (18), and 153 (54) s with sugammadex, neostigmine, and placebo, respectively (sugammadex was significantly faster than neostigmine and placebo, P<0.05). Recovery of T4/T1 was also faster for sugammadex than neostigmine and placebo. Neostigmine administration after complete recovery of T4/T1 decreased upper airway dilator muscle activity to 64 (30)% of baseline and decreased tidal volume (P<0.05 for both variables), whereas sugammadex had no effect on either variable.
In contrast to neostigmine, which significantly impairs upper airway dilator muscle activity when given after recovery from neuromuscular block, a reversal dose of sugammadex given under the same conditions does not affect genioglossus muscle activity and normal breathing. Human studies will be required to evaluate the clinical relevance of our findings.
To investigate the possible relation between certain HLA antigens and toxicity during treatment with sodium aurothiomalate of D-penicillamine, we studied 91 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Seventy-one had toxic reactions to either drug or both drugs; the remaining 20 took one of the drugs for at least six months, without toxicity. Nineteen of 24 patients in whom proteinuria developed were positive for HLA-B8 and HLA-DRW3 antigens; 14 of 15 episodes of aurothiomalate-induced proteinura and nine of 13 episodes of penicillamine-induced proteinura occurred in patients with these antigens. All 13 episodes of proteinuria in which urinary protein exceeded 2 g in 24 hours occurred in patients with DRw3. The relative risk of proteinuria during treatment with aurothiomalate is increased 32 times in patients who are HLA-DRw3 positive. No significant associations were found between any HLA antigen and development of skin rashes or hematologic complications. Toxicity during aurothiomalate or penicillamine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis may be under genetic control.
