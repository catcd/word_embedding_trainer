Eleven patients with systemic mycotic infections were treated with amphotericin B, 1 mg/kg, on alternate days. Five patients also received mannitol (M), 1 g/kg, in the amphotericin infusion, while six served as controls (C). Renal function studies prior to therapy were repeated at a total cumulative amphotericin B dosage of 25 mg/kg; renal biopsies were obtained from 10 patients. Inulin and creatinine clearances decreased in both the C and M groups, significantly so in the latter. Urinary concentrating ability of five patients (2C, 3M) decreased as did the capacity of three (1C, 2M) to acidify urine after an acid load. Neither the peak and valley levels of amphotericin B in serum nor the urinary excretion thereof differed between the C and M groups. Striking vacuolization of smooth muscle cells, previously unrecognized, was observed in the media of arterioles and arteries in all renal biopsies. Tubular calcification was present in both groups. In summary, M therapy (1 g/kg) did not protect against the nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B. A unique lesion of the renal vasculature secondary to amphotericin B is described.
A double-blind study with volunteers was performed to determine the incidence and severity of thrombophlebitis associated with cephalothin, cephapirin, cefamandole, and a water control. Although there were no statistical differences in the incidence of thrombophlebitis, cephalothin resulted in significantly more severe thrombophlebitis compared with the other agents.
The efficacy of different antibiotics was compared in an experimental model of aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits, using a serotype 19 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin (MIC 12 mg/L) and ceftriaxone (MIC 12 mg/L). The results were compared with those of a control group, which received no treatment. One hundred and nineteen animals were treated with one of the following antibiotic regimens: im procaine penicillin G at a dosage of 300,000 U/kg weight/12 h (16 animals); iv trovafloxacin, 13.3 mg/kg/12 h (31 animals); iv ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/24 h (21 animals); iv vancomycin, 20 mg/kg/12 h (15 animals) and im quinupristin-dalfopristin, 30 mg/kg/8 h (20 animals). All the antibiotics used in this study proved to be efficient in reducing numbers of S. pneumoniae and in increasing the percentage of aortic vegetations that were rendered sterile compared with the control group. Penicillin at the dosage used in our study was capable of achieving serum concentrations two or three times greater than the MIC, thus demonstrating its effectiveness as an antibiotic for this endocarditis model. No significant difference was observed between the effects of vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and penicillin. Vancomycin proved to be more efficient than trovofloxacin in reducing the bacterial load and increasing the numbers sterilized. There was also a tendency for this antibiotic to be more effective than ceftriaxone in reducing the bacterial load of the vegetations. There was a statistically significant correlation between the weight of the vegetations and their bacterial load. In the light of these results, vancomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin may be considered suitable alternatives to penicillin for the treatment of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae endocarditis.
The use of propofol compared with isoflurane is associated with improved patient comfort and decreased costs. However, as the cost saving, the quicker recovery time and patient comfort may not be evident if sevoflurane is substituted for isoflurane; these two anaesthetic agents were analysed in elderly patients.
In a prospective randomized study, 96 patients undergoing elective ophthalmic surgery received either total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol (Group P), propofol for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance (Group P/S) or sevoflurane for inhalation induction and maintenance (Group S). Analyses focussed on haemodynamics, the quality of recovery, and the costs for the anaesthetic and the entire procedure.
Bradycardia or hypotension, mainly registered in Groups P and P/S, did not influence patients' recovery. In Group S, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurred frequently, and 50% of patients complained of discomfort during induction. In Group P/S, the costs for anaesthetics and total costs were lower than those in Groups P and S.
Propofol- and sevoflurane-based maintenance of anaesthesia were similar with regard to patient comfort and recovery in the elderly. Cost analysis revealed that it was less expensive to use propofol for induction and sevoflurane for maintenance than to use either propofol or sevoflurane as sole agents for anaesthesia.
To report a case of terbinafine-induced autoimmune hepatitis in a patient with chronic hepatitis B infection.
A 57-year-old Taiwanese male with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) began an oral regimen of terbinafine 250 mg once daily for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis, despite the manufacturer's recommendation not to use the drug in patients with liver dysfunction. The patient's liver enzyme levels were within normal limits at initiation of therapy. Immediately prior to concluding the 12 week treatment course, he became anorexic with malaise and subsequently developed ascites and jaundice. After a visit to an outside emergency department and positively trending liver function test levels, he was referred to our liver clinic. The patient was taking no other medications or herbal supplements, did not drink alcohol, and did not appear to suffer a flare of HBV infection. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of transient autoantibodies and a liver biopsy consistent with acute autoimmune drug injury. Three weeks after terbinafine was discontinued, peak levels of aspartate aminotransferase (1282 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (1044 IU/L), and bilirubin (5.9 mg/dL) were noted; his platelet level had decreased to 77 x 10(3)/mm3. He was treated with supportive care that included vitamin K for coagulopathy, diuretics for ascites, and adefovir to prevent hepatitis B exacerbation. The patient's liver function studies began to normalize 6 weeks after terbinafine was discontinued.
Terbinafine-induced hepatobiliary dysfunction, due to hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, or mixed form, has been reported, but this is the first case of autoimmune hepatitis supported by serologic, biochemical, and biopsy results. Use of the Naranjo probability scale revealed a probable relationship between the patient's hepatitis and terbinafine. Furthermore, the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method, a scoring system that specifically assesses the likelihood of drug-induced elevated levels of liver-associated enzymes, also supported a probable relationship. The pathogenesis of most drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis remains speculative, likely involving hapten-carrier complex and the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. In this patient, his chronic HBV carrier state may have predisposed him to this autoimmune reaction.
Healthcare practitioners should heed the manufacturer's warning that terbinafine not be used in patients with underlying hepatic disease.
Present knowledge suggests that cocaine is almost always used by snorting, injecting, or smoking. During a recent treatment study, we encountered 2 cases who reported active cocaine use by the sublingual route exclusively. We describe here 1) the method of sublingual use, 2) its attraction for cocaine dependent individuals, especially those who wish to conceal use, and 3) concerns regarding the medical consequences of sublingual cocaine use. Sublingual cocaine use may cause unique medical symptoms and may easily evade detection by medical personnel.
Following gastrectomy for locally advanced adenocarcinomas, three patients developed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and renal failure shortly after completing courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with mitomycin and 5-FU. These complications progressed despite cessation of chemotherapy, and all three patients died of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema precipitated in two cases by blood transfusions. At autopsy, two patients had no residual carcinoma and all had a diffuse microangiopathy involving mainly the kidneys and lungs. There was intimal hyperplasia of many arterioles sometimes associated with complete occlusion of the lumen, prominent nuclear atypia in many capillary cells, and numerous capillary fibrin thrombi. Direct immunofluorescence studies revealed extensive fibrinogen-fibrin deposits in the vascular lesions. Chemotherapy-induced microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and renal failure may predispose patients to fatal episodes of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that can be triggered by blood transfusions.
Mitomycin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a life-threatening complication of this therapy, and increased levels of circulating immune complexes and hypocomplementemia have been found in some patients. We further characterize the role of immune complexes in mitomycin-HUS by showing that removal of these complexes by immunoadsorption with staphylococcal protein A columns correlates with temporal improvement in the microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in this disorder. Two immune complexes bound to the protein A column were identified: an 11S platelet-aggregating protein and a 15S non-platelet-aggregating protein. In addition, the patient had anaphylactoid reactions at the onset of immunoadsorption similar to first-use dialysis reactions that correlated with increases in complement 3a and 5a, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor levels. This case suggests that platelet-aggregating and complement-fixing circulating immune complexes are, in part, a proximate cause for mitomycin C-induced HUS. Therapy for mitomycin (HUS) with protein A columns should continue until circulating immune complexes reach undetectable levels and serum complement levels return to the normal range.
Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is a common type of mastocytosis. Current treatment of CM is generally symptomatic. Pimecrolimus has been demonstrated as an effective anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, but whether it treats CM remains unknown.
The murine model of CM was induced by subcutaneous injection of 100 μg/kg recombinant murine stem cell factor (rmSCF) for a total of 17 days in Balb/c mice. Beginning on the 8th day, treatment with pimecrolimus 1% cream or vehicle was performed topically and daily for 10 days. The clinical signs of CM were scored, and pathological analysis was performed with toluidine blue staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The in situ apoptotic mast cells (MCs) were studied by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. The cutaneous histamine level was measured by ELISA.
In the rmSCF-treated mice, the clinical signs of CM, including erythema, wheal after rubbing lesion skins, and increased thickness of skin, were obvious compared to control mice, and were reduced after pimecrolimus treatment. The numbers of cutaneous MCs and neutrophils were significantly greater in mice with CM than in control mice, and pimecrolimus treatment decreased the numbers of MCs but not neutrophils. Extensive apoptosis of cutaneous MCs was observed in pimecrolimus-treated mice. The cutaneous histamine level was elevated in the mice with CM compared with healthy controls, and was lowered after treatment with pimecrolimus.
Pimecrolimus effectively treats CM by reducing the density of cutaneous MCs and the subsequent histamine production through inducing MCs apoptosis.
To evaluate the risk of idiopathic venous thromboembolism associated with antidepressant use and to further assess the risk by class of antidepressant and by individual antidepressant drug.
Nested case-control study.
United Kingdom General Practice Research Database.
Seven hundred eighty-two case patients with a confirmed diagnosis of venous thromboembolism who were taking an antidepressant drug and 3085 matched control subjects.
We identified all people in the database aged 70 years or younger with venous thromboembolism who had filled at least one prescription for an antidepressant drug between 1990 and 2005; up to four control subjects were matched to each case patient by age, sex, practice attended, index date, and duration of computerized medical record. We compared the risks of current and recent use of antidepressant drugs with nonuse of an antidepressant before the index date (date of diagnosis of venous thromboembolism) by using conditional logistic regression. Current exposure to tricyclic antidepressants was associated with a small increased risk of idiopathic venous thromboembolism compared with nonuse (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.8), whereas we found no increased risk among users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or other antidepressant drugs. When we evaluated individual drugs, we found that amitriptyline conferred an increased risk of thromboembolism (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4) that increased with increasing dose (> 25 mg/day). No other individual antidepressant drug was associated with an increase in risk of venous thromboembolism.
Current exposure to amitriptyline, particularly at high doses, was associated with an increased risk of idiopathic venous thromboembolism.
Aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of interferon and ribavirin combination therapy on liver histopathological outcomes.
Pre-treatment and post 24-week treatment liver biopsy specimens were available in 68 naive patients, 37 nonresponders and 18 relapsers after interferon monotherapy. For all patients paired liver biopsies (6-month interval) were assessed for necroinflammation (according to the method by K. Ishak), fibrosis (according to METAVIR score) and steatosis at the end of 24-week treatment.
Virological end-of-treatment response was: 36.8% in naive patients, 24.3% in nonresponders and 22.2% in relapsers. Out of 38 patients, who achieved virological end-of-treatment response, sustained virological response was in 65.8%. There was obvious drop of histological activity features scores in all treated patients at the end of 24-week treatment period. According to the baseline findings, only confluent necrosis was found to be significantly lower in patients, who achieved virological end-of- treatment response (p<0.05). The fibrosis and steatosis has not been influenced at least by 24-week treatment success. But in patients, who achieved sustained virological response, fibrosis was lower at baseline and after 24-week of interferon and ribavirin therapy (p<0.001). In conclusion, assessment of liver histopathology has real value in the evaluation of therapeutic response. Grade of pre-treatment confluent necrosis could predict virological end-of-treatment response. Lower stage of fibrosis both at baseline and after 24-week treatment period seems to be a predictor of sustained virological response.
Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is expressed in brain structures involved in cognition, but the effect of selective BuChE inhibitors on human cognitive function is unknown. We report a patient whose cognitive function deteriorated following a reduction and improved following reinstitution of ethopropazine, a selective BuChE inhibitor. We suggest that, because neurons expressing BuChE may be involved in cognition, there is merit to further evaluation of selective BuChE inhibitors in treating cognitive dysfunction.
Acebutolol is a unique beta blocker that possesses cardioselectivity, partial agonist activity, and membrane stabilizing activity. Sodium bicarbonate is used to reverse the cardiotoxic effects of other drugs with membrane stabilizing activity. There have been no reported cases of acebutolol-induced ventricular dysrhythmias treated successfully with bolus sodium bicarbonate.
A 48-year-old man ingested approximately 6.4 g of acebutolol with ethanol (blood ethanol 61 mmol/L). There were no other coingestants identified. One hour after presentation, the patient had a cardiac arrest with the monitor showing ventricular tachycardia. Sodium bicarbonate 50 mEq intravenous push converted the patient to sinus rhythm and the blood pressure improved to 129/90 mm Hg.
This case demonstrates a temporal relationship between bolus sodium bicarbonate administration and the termination of acebutolol-induced ventricular tachycardia.
Despite extensive clinical experience the role of digoxin is still not well defined. In patients with atrial fibrillation digoxin is beneficial for ventricular rate control. For patients in sinus rhythm and heart failure the situation is less clear. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs. Also, digoxin has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands, and causing arrhythmias. There is a paucity of data from well-designed trials. The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit. More convincing evidence is required showing that digoxin improves symptoms or exercise capacity. Furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality. Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that digoxin may increase mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used first as they are safer, do not require blood level monitoring, modify progression of disease, relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality. Caution should be exercised in using digoxin until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm. Until then digoxin should be considered a third-line therapy.
The administration of high doses of sodium penthiobarbital in intensive resuscitation sometimes results in venous and cutaneous lesions in the form of phlebitis associated with major necrosis. Histological analysis demonstrates that these are essentially intimal lesions and the authors suggest various hypotheses to explain the origin of such clinical signs.
Aldosterone excess or "escape" can occur after treatment with medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or in undiagnosed primary aldosteronism. Spironolactone is thought to be an important addition to resistant hypertension (RH) treatment. In this study, resistant (RH) and controlled (CH) hypertensives and normotensive patients were submitted to echocardiography, flow-mediated vasodilation, carotid intima-media wall thickness studies, renin plasma activity, and aldosterone plasma levels and plasma and urinary sodium and potassium concentrations at baseline (pre-spironolactone phase). Subsequently, for only RH and CH groups, 25 mg/d spironolactone was added to preexisting treatments over 6 months. Afterwards, these parameters were reassessed (post-spironolactone phase). The RH and CH groups achieved reductions in blood pressure (P<.001), decreases in left ventricular hypertrophy (P<.001), improved diastolic function (Kappa index RH: 0.219 and Kappa index CH: 0.392) and increases in aldosterone concentrations (P<.05). The RH group attained improved endothelium-dependent (P<.001) and independent (P=.007) function. Optimized RH treatment with spironolactone reduces blood pressure and improves endothelial and diastolic function and left ventricular hypertrophy despite the presence of aldosterone excess or escape.
During cytostatic combination treatment with five different anti-tumor agents two female patients suffered from cardiac failure which proved fatal. This was mainly due to doxorubicine (adriamycin) and daunorubicine. In an 8-year-old patient the cumulative dose was reached after 14 months of treatment (total dose of adriamycin 420 mg/m2, of daunorubicine 280 mg/m2) and in a 7-year-old patient after 16 months (total dose of adriamycin 480 mg/m2, of daunorubicine 280 mg/m2). Cardiac failure which occurred 12 months after the onset of treatment in a 12-year-old girl (total dose of adriamycin 310 mg/m2 and of daunorubicine 280 mg/m2) could be brought under control. The cumulative dose of adriamycin should be limited to 500 mg/m2 in children without risk factors.
One-third of all primary central nervous system tumors in adults are meningiomas. Rarely, meningiomas occur at multiple sites, usually occurring in individuals with type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2). We sequenced the exomes of three unrelated individuals with familial multiple spinal meningiomas without NF2 mutations. We identified two individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex subunit gene SMARCE1. Sequencing of SMARCE1 in six further individuals with spinal meningiomas identified two additional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Tumors from individuals with SMARCE1 mutations were of clear-cell histological subtype, and all had loss of SMARCE1 protein, consistent with a tumor suppressor mechanism. Our findings identify multiple-spinal-meningioma disease as a new discrete entity and establish a key role for the SWI/SNF complex in the pathogenesis of both meningiomas and tumors with clear-cell histology.
Relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carries a poor prognosis, despite intensive retreatment, owing to intrinsic drug resistance. The biological pathways that mediate resistance are unknown. Here, we report the transcriptome profiles of matched diagnosis and relapse bone marrow specimens from ten individuals with pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia using RNA sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing identified 20 newly acquired, novel nonsynonymous mutations not present at initial diagnosis, with 2 individuals harboring relapse-specific mutations in the same gene, NT5C2, encoding a 5'-nucleotidase. Full-exon sequencing of NT5C2 was completed in 61 further relapse specimens, identifying additional mutations in 5 cases. Enzymatic analysis of mutant proteins showed that base substitutions conferred increased enzymatic activity and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies. Clinically, all individuals who harbored NT5C2 mutations relapsed early, within 36 months of initial diagnosis (P = 0.03). These results suggest that mutations in NT5C2 are associated with the outgrowth of drug-resistant clones in ALL.
A case of infective endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was successfully treated with a combination therapy with cefmetazole (CMZ) and fosfomycin (FOM). A 55 year old man was admitted to the Keio Hospital because of fever of unknown origin. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 132/62 mmHg, heart rate of 118/min and body temperature of 39.8 degrees C. Diastolic regurgitant murmur (Levine II/VI) was heard at the left sternal border on the third intercostal space. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly. Two dimensional echocardiography and color flow mapping demonstrated mildly dilated and hyperkinetic left ventricle, redundant aortic valve, giant vegetation from the aortic valve and severe aortic regurgitation. MRSA was isolated from the blood of this patient. Bacteriostatic synergism between CMZ and FOM against S. aureus isolated from the blood of this patient was detected both by the Kirby-Bauer method and by the checker-board method. The combination therapy with CMZ and FOM cleared the clinical symptoms and normalized the inflammatory reactions. No relapse was observed for at least 10 months. We concluded that the combination therapy with CMZ and FOM was invaluable for the treatment of infections endocarditis by MRSA.
To evaluate the hemodynamic effects of calcium chloride in a canine model of acute propranolol toxicity.
Two minutes after the completion of a propranolol infusion (10 mg/kg), a bolus of .125 mL/kg 10% CaCl solution followed by an infusion of .375 mL/kg over the next 30 minutes or a bolus and subsequent infusion of an equivalent volume of normal saline solution was administered to each dog.
CaCl yielded significant improvements in propranolol-induced decreases in cardiac index and stroke volume compared with saline solution-treated control animals (overall alpha = .05). Furthermore, CaCl administration resulted in earlier improvement in propranolol-induced alterations in mean arterial pressure, maximal left ventricular pressure change over time, and peripheral vascular resistance compared with saline solution (overall alpha = .05). We observed no difference between treatment groups in response to propranolol-induced bradycardia or QRS-interval prolongation.
In this model of acute propranolol toxicity, CaCl therapy improved depressed hemodynamic status, mainly by a positive inotropic action.
Negram-Citrat (0.66 g nalidixic acid plus 4 g sodium citrate, NAC) twice daily for five days was evaluated in 257 women with symptoms of acute lower urinary tract infection and nalidixic acid sensitive bacteriuria. At two days post-treatment 85% of the patients were abacteriuric while nalidixic acid resistant Escherichia coli bacteriuria was present in five %. Side effects of NAC were usually mild and transient and resulted in interruption of medication in three % of the patients and visual disturbances were volunteered by 1.6%. At follow-up one month after treatment bacteriuria had recurred in 18% of the patients immediately cured, thus resulting in an overall success rate of 70%. Of the 35 recurring strains three (1 E. coli, 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis) were nalidixic acid resistant.
Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is a well-known clinical entity that complicates the course of infectious diseases treated under this antibiotic regime. Recently, a new administration form of tobramycin, inhaled tobramycin (TOBI), has been approved to improve the antibacterial activity and reduce nephrotoxicity. We describe the clinical case of a 73-year-old woman with chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who developed acute renal failure (ARF) after using TOBI. Clinical presentation and biochemical parameters were compatible with aminoglycoside-induced renal failure. Based on the clinical findings presented here, a surveillance program should be established to monitor the presence of factors predisposing to renal failure, and to measure serum levels of tobramycin.
