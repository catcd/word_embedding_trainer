The serum-digoxin level was measured by radio-immunoassay (Immutope) on 245 patients in a coronary care unit. Cardiac arrhythmias were assumed to be digoxin-induced if they disappeared after the drug had been stopped. Patients who had received digitoxin or spironolactone were excluded. The results indicated a normal digoxin range of 1.52 +/- 0.2 ng/ml and a toxic one of 2.78 +/- 0.38 ng/ml. First degree A-V block, atrial ectopic beats and ventricular ectopics with variable coupling intervals were frequently associated with serum-digoxin levels of 1.5-2.5 ng/ml, while higher grade A-V block, atrial tachycardia, bigeminy and atrial tachycardia with block were more frequent with higher serum-digoxin levels (greater than 3.0 ng/ml). Atrial arrhythmias were especially frequent with serum levels above 3.0 ng/ml. This suggests different sensitivities of atrial and ventricular myocardium. Atrial arrhythmias thus in general indicate a higher degree of toxicity at high serum levels, while ventricular ectopic beats occur both with high serum levels and also with increased digoxin sensitivity of the ventricles.
On the 3rd day after a cesarean section, because of pre-eclampsia, blood pressure was still high, oral labetalol 100 mg with an 8-hour interval was given, followed by 50 mg i.v. administered over 10 min, twice with a 5-hour interval. The last injection was immediately followed by an atrio-ventricular tachycardia with massive decrease in blood pressure. The reason for this is discussed.
Adverse drug reactions (ADR), especially intravenous hemolysis, have largely limited the application of puerarin injections in clinics. This study investigated the underlying mechanisms of puerarin-induced hemolysis. Our results show that puerarin induced concentration-dependent and time-dependent hemolysis when human erythrocytes were incubated in saline solution with more than 2mM puerarin for over 2h. However, incubation in PBS or addition of 1mM of lidocaine to the saline solution completely abolished the hemolysis. Providing materials that could start ATP synthesis did not reverse the hemolysis, and puerarin did not affect Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. In addition, puerarin (0.1-2mM) did not cause calcium influx or exhibited pro-oxidant activity in erythrocytes. Puerarin exhibited different influences on the membrane microviscosity of erythrocytes in saline and PBS. Moreover, 1mM lidocaine inhibited 8mM puerarin-induced reduction of membrane microviscosity in saline solution. SDS-PAGE analysis of membrane proteins revealed that 2mM puerarin treatment induced the appearance of several new protein bands but attenuated the expression of protein bands 2.1, 3, 4.1, 4.2 and 5. These results suggest that high concentrations of puerarin-induced hemolysis were associated with the changes of membrane lipids and of the composition of erythrocytes membrane proteins but not with ATP depletion, pro-oxidation and calcium influx. These changes could be related to the intercalation of amphiphilic puerarin at high concentration into the erythrocyte membrane in certain media, resulting in membrane disorganization and, eventually, cytolysis. Hence, in clinics, determining the optimal dose of puerarin is critical to avoid overdosing and ADR.
Chromosome region 1q21.1 contains extensive and complex low-copy repeats, and copy number variants (CNVs) in this region have recently been reported in association with congenital heart defects, developmental delay, schizophrenia and related psychoses. We describe 21 probands with the 1q21.1 microdeletion and 15 probands with the 1q21.1 microduplication. These CNVs were inherited in most of the cases in which parental studies were available. Consistent and statistically significant features of microcephaly and macrocephaly were found in individuals with microdeletion and microduplication, respectively. Notably, a paralog of the HYDIN gene located on 16q22.2 and implicated in autosomal recessive hydrocephalus was inserted into the 1q21.1 region during the evolution of Homo sapiens; we found this locus to be deleted or duplicated in the individuals we studied, making it a probable candidate for the head size abnormalities observed. We propose that recurrent reciprocal microdeletions and microduplications within 1q21.1 represent previously unknown genomic disorders characterized by abnormal head size along with a spectrum of developmental delay, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, dysmorphic features and congenital anomalies. These phenotypes are subject to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.
Neural cross-sensitization has been postulated as a mechanism underlying overlaps of chronic pelvic pain disorders such as bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Animals with experimental colitis have been used to study the underlying mechanisms for overlapped pelvic pain symptoms, and shown to exhibit bladder overactivity evidenced by frequent voiding; however, it has not directly been evaluated whether pain sensation derived from the lower urinary tract is enhanced in colitis models. Also, the cross-sensitization between the colon and urethra has not been studied previously. In the present study, we therefore investigated pain behaviors induced by nociceptive stimuli in the lower urinary tract and the involvement of C-fiber afferent pathways using rats with colitis induced by intracolonic application of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). In TNBS-induced colitis rats at 10 days, intravesical application of resiniferatoxin (RTx) induced a significantly greater number of episodes of both licking and freezing behaviors, which were reduced by capsaicin-sensitive C-fiber afferent desensitization. Histochemical studies using fluorescent dye tracers injected into the colon, bladder or urethra showed that dichotomized afferent neurons comprised 6.9-14.5% of L1, L6 and S1 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating the colon or the lower urinary tract. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) mRNA expression was significantly increased in, the bladder, urethra and S1 DRG in colitis rats. An increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was found in the colon, but not in the bladder or urethra after intracolonic TNBS treatment. These results indicate that TNBS-induced colitis increased pain sensitivity in the bladder and urethra via activation of C-fiber afferent pathways due to colon-to-bladder and colon-to-urethral cross-sensitization, suggesting the contribution of pelvic organ cross-sensitization mechanisms to overlapped pain symptoms in BPS/IC and IBS.
Colon cancer is the major health hazard related with high mortality and it is a pathological consequence of persistent oxidative stress and inflammation. Farnesol, an isoprenoid alcohol, has been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties. The present study was performed to evaluate the protective efficacy of farnesol against 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) induced oxidative stress, inflammatory response and apoptotic tissue damage. Farnesol was administered once daily for seven consecutive days at the doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight in corn oil. On day 7, a single injection of DMH was given subcutaneously in the groin at the dose of 40 mg/kg body weight. Protective effects of farnesol were assessed by using caspase-3 activity, tissue lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antioxidant status as end point markers. Further strengthening was evident on histopathological observations used to assess the protective efficacy of farnesol. Prophylactic treatment with farnesol significantly ameliorates DMH induced oxidative damage by diminishing the tissue LPO accompanied by increase in enzymatic viz., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and quinone reductase (QR) and non-enzymatic viz., reduced glutathione (GSH) antioxidant status. Farnesol supplementation significantly decreased caspase-3 activity in colonic tissue. Histological findings also revealed that pretreatment with farnesol significantly reduced the severity of submucosal edema, regional destruction of the mucosal layer and intense infiltration of the inflammatory cells in mucosal and submucosal layers of the colon. The data of the present study suggest that farnesol effectively suppress DMH induced colonic mucosal damage by ameliorating oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic responses.
This study examined depressive symptoms in acute schizophrenic episodes and their relationship to neuroleptic treatment. Sixty-three depressed and 62 non-depressed acutely exacerbated schizophrenic patients were evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, the Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Scale, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Subjects were then randomly assigned to different haloperidol plasma levels and followed for 3 weeks. Overall, depression improved with treatment of the acute psychosis, but a positive association between extrapyramidal side effects and depressive symptoms emerged over time. Depressive symptoms tended to be positively related to haloperidol plasma levels. The results suggest that depressive symptoms in schizophrenia are heterogeneous in origin; while neuroleptics can ameliorate depressive symptoms inherent in the acute schizophrenic episode, they can also contribute to depression.
Recent studies have shown that the polyol pathway is involved in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced myocardial infarction, but the mechanism is unclear. We previously found that lack of aldose reductase (AR), the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, attenuated the increase in transferrin (Tf) level in I/R brain, suggesting that AR contributes to iron-catalyzed free radical-induced damage. We therefore investigated if this mechanism occurs in I/R hearts. We found that inhibition of AR or sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), the second enzyme of the polyol pathway, both attenuated the I/R-mediated increases in HIF-1alpha, Tf, TfR, and intracellular iron content and reduced the I/R-induced infarct area of the heart. Further, administration of niacin, which replenishes NAD+, the cofactor for SDH, also normalized TfR and HIF-1alpha levels in I/R hearts. These results suggest that during I/R polyol pathway activity increases the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio. This activates HIF-1alpha that induces the expression of TfR, which in turn increases Tf uptake and iron accumulation and exacerbates oxidative damage that increases the lipid peroxidation. This was confirmed by the fact that administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine attenuated the I/R-induced myocardial infarction.
Pyrethroid insecticides are one of the most commonly used residential and agricultural insecticides. Based on the increased use of pyrethroids and recent studies showing that pregnant women and children are exposed to pyrethroids, there are concerns over the potential for developmental neurotoxicity. However, there have been relatively few studies on the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. In this study, we sought to investigate the developmental toxicity of six common pyrethroids, three type I compounds (permethrin, resmethrin, and bifenthrin) and three type II compounds (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin), and to determine whether zebrafish embryos may be an appropriate model for studying the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to pyrethroids caused a dose-dependent increase in mortality and pericardial edema, with type II compounds being the most potent. At doses approaching the LC(50), permethrin and deltamethrin caused craniofacial abnormalities. These findings are consistent with mammalian studies demonstrating that pyrethroids are mildly teratogenic at very high doses. However, at lower doses, body axis curvature and spasms were observed, which were reminiscent of the classic syndromes observed with pyrethroid toxicity. Treatment with diazepam ameliorated the spasms, while treatment with the sodium channel antagonist MS-222 ameliorated both spasms and body curvature, suggesting that pyrethroid-induced neurotoxicity is similar in zebrafish and mammals. Taken in concert, these data suggest that zebrafish may be an appropriate alternative model to study the mechanism(s) responsible for the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroid insecticides and aid in identification of compounds that should be further tested in mammalian systems.
Spirulina platensis, used worldwide as a food supplement, is a natural source of protein, vitamins, carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fatty acids. C-Phycocyanin (C-Pc), its major biliprotein, is known to possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and radical scavenging properties. Our present study showed that treatment with C-Pc protects the rats from Tributyltin (TBT) induced thymic atrophy. The results reveal TBT-induced oxidative stress mediated apoptosis in rat thymocytes in vivo and its attenuation by C-Pc. This ameliorative effect could be attributed to antioxidant activity of the biliprotein. C-Pc also increased TBTC reduced thymic weight and cellularity as well. TBTC-induced ROS generation and lowered GSH levels were restored by C-Pc, suggesting its radical scavenging properties. The various apoptotic determinants such as mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-3 activity and apoptotic cell population were effectively modulated by C-Pc treatment. We make this first observation to illustrate the effectiveness of C-Pc in reducing TBTC-induced thymic atrophy. The morphology of thymic tissue was restored to near normal by this biliprotein. The present study, therefore, suggests that C-Pc could serve as an effective natural antioxidant for efficient management of TBTC induced oxidative damage.
We hypothesized that aspirin (ASA) might alter the beneficial effect of beta-blockers on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure.
Aspirin blunts the vasodilation caused by both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers in hypertensive patients and in patients with heart failure. Several studies suggest that ASA also blunts some of beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on mortality in patients with heart failure. To our knowledge, there have been no data evaluating the possible interaction of ASA and beta-blockers on left ventricular remodeling in patients with heart failure.
We retrospectively evaluated patients entered into the Multicenter Oral Carvedilol Heart failure Assessment (MOCHA) trial, a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-response evaluation of carvedilol in patients with chronic stable symptomatic heart failure. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine if aspirin independently influenced the improvement in LVEF.
Over all randomized patients (n = 293), LVEF improved 8.2 +/- 0.8 ejection fraction (EF) units in ASA nonusers and 4.5 +/- 0.7 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.005). In subjects randomized to treatment with carvedilol (n = 231), LVEF improved 9.5 +/- 0.9 EF units in ASA nonusers and 5.8 +/- 0.8 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.02). In subjects randomized to treatment with placebo (n = 62), LVEF improved 2.8 +/- 1.2 EF units in ASA nonusers and 0.5 +/- 1.4 EF units in ASA users (p = 0.20). Aspirin did not significantly affect the heart rate or systolic blood pressure response in either the placebo or carvedilol groups. The effect of ASA became more significant on multivariate analysis. The change in LVEF was also influenced by carvedilol dose, etiology of heart failure, baseline heart rate, EF and coumadin use. The detrimental effect of ASA on the improvement in LVEF was dose-related and was present in both placebo and carvedilol groups, although the effect was statistically significant only in the much larger carvedilol group.
Aspirin significantly affects the changes in LVEF over time in patients with heart failure and systolic dysfunction treated with carvedilol. The specific mechanism(s) underlying this interaction are unknown and further studies are needed to provide additional understanding of the molecular basis of factors influencing reverse remodeling in patients with heart failure.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cardiac effects of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL35135, and determine whether beta 3-receptors are involved in mediating chronotropic or inotropic responses in man. Eight normal males received single oral doses of BRL35135 8 mg (BRL) or the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol 8 mg (SAL), after pretreatment with either placebo (PL), bisoprolol 5 mg (B5) as a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, or nadolol 20 mg (N20) to block beta 1- and beta 2- but not beta 3-receptors. Both BRL and SAL produced a significant increase in postural finger tremor in keeping with beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation, and this response was totally abolished by pretreatment with N20. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and Doppler stroke distance occurred with BRL and SAL which were unaffected by pretreatment with B5 and completely blocked by N20, in keeping with beta 2-mediated effects. BRL and SAL produced significant chronotropic and minute distance responses which were unaffected by beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. However, whereas N20 blocked these responses to SAL, a small but significant response occurred with BRL in comparison with placebo despite complete blockade of co-existing beta 2-mediated effects. Compared with PL, the mean responses to N20/BRL, and the 95% confidence interval for the differences between the means were 7.4 beats min-1 [3.2 to 11.6] (P = 0.002) for heart rate, and 208.8 cm [38.3 to 379.3] (P = 0.02) for minute distance responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Aspirin therapy for stroke prophylaxis in low risk patients has paradoxically demonstrated an increased risk of ischemic stroke in several studies. Moreover, the MAST-Italy trial reported a near doubling of mortality with the addition of aspirin to thrombolytics while experimentally, we have noted that aspirin antagonizes t-PA-mediated clot lysis. The mechanisms responsible for these observations is unclear. Of interest, few studies have examined the effect of aspirin on cerebral blood flow (CBF). The objective of this study was to examine the acute effect of high dose aspirin on CBF in a rabbit model. Mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gases, and core and brain temperature were controlled throughout the protocol. CBF, measured by the technique of hydrogen clearance using Platinum-Iridium flow probes, was measured before and 20 min following aspirin administration (20 mg kg-1 i.v.) in a cohort of 50 rabbits and compared to rabbits receiving vehicle (n = 19). Following aspirin therapy, CBF (cc/100 g-1 min-1) was reduced from 80.8 +/- 27.4 to 65.1 +/- 31.7 (mean +/- SD), a reduction to 80.4 +/- 21.3% of baseline (p < 0.00001, t-test), whereas CBF in the control group remained unchanged (81.0 +/- 25.4 vs. 77.5 +/- 24.0, mean +/- SD). Thus aspirin acutely reduced CBF by approximately 20% in a rabbit model, perhaps related to inhibitory effects on prostacyclin and/or nitric oxide. This result may help explain the possible increase in ischemic stroke seen in low risk patients on aspirin therapy. A reduction in CBF by aspirin may also assist in understanding the antagonism of t-PA-mediated clot lysis by aspirin seen in our rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke, particularly since all agents which share the ability to reverse this antagonism (nitric oxide donors, beta blockers, hydralazine, prostacyclin) also increase CBF by approximately 20%. Future strategies for 'antiplatelet' therapy may benefit from using agents which do not adversely affect CBF.
Neuropsychiatric symptoms related to aciclovir or valaciclovir treatment have been a problem since aciclovir was introduced in the early 1980s. We have previously found that subjects with aciclovir-related neuropsychiatric symptoms have increased serum concentrations of aciclovir's main metabolite, 9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine (CMMG). The aim of this study was to investigate whether CMMG was present in the CSF of aciclovir- or valaciclovir-treated subjects with or without neuropsychiatric side effects that appeared during therapy.
We investigated retrospectively CSF collected from 21 aciclovir- or valaciclovir-treated subjects. Of these, 9 were subjects with neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms and 12 were asymptomatic subjects, including 10 subjects from a valaciclovir multiple sclerosis trial and 2 subjects with recurrent herpes encephalitis.
CMMG could only be detected in the CSF of subjects with neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs (median CMMG concentration 1.0 micromol/L, range 0.6-7.0). The concentration of CMMG was below the limit of quantification (<0.5 micromol/L) in asymptomatic subjects (P < 0.001). All patients with neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, except one, had acute renal function impairment or chronic renal failure.
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CMMG is involved in the development of neuropsychiatric side effects in aciclovir- or valaciclovir-treated patients. Measurement of CMMG in CSF and/or serum is a promising tool in the diagnostic procedure for aciclovir- or valaciclovir-treated patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms and may help to differentiate between side effects and herpes encephalitis.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the basal ganglia motor circuitry is a highly effective treatment for the debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, recent findings have indicated promising potential for PD therapy with DBS in brain structures outside the basal ganglia. For example, high frequency stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PH) can reverse haloperidol-induced akinesia in rats [Jackson J, Young CK, Hu B, Bland BH (2008) High frequency stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus restores movement and reinstates hippocampal-striatal theta coherence following haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Exp Neurol 213:210-219]. In the current study, we used the bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of Parkinsonian akinesia in male Long-Evans rats to further explore the efficacy of PH DBS. The application of PH DBS in lesioned animals reversed akinesia in an active avoidance paradigm with increased latency compared to pre-lesion performance. The dramatic reversal of akinesia in two models of rodent Parkinsonism by PH DBS warrants further exploration of its therapeutic potential.
Cervical cancer is the second most common female cancer worldwide, and it remains a challenge to manage preinvasive and invasive lesions. Fruit-based cancer prevention entities, such as flavonoid and their derivatives, have demonstrated a marked ability to inhibit preclinical models of epithelial cancer cell growth and tumor formation. Here, we extend the role of naringin-mediated chemoprevention to that of cervical carcinogenesis. The present study sought to investigate the therapeutic potential effect of naringin on apoptosis in human cervical SiHa cancer cells. Viability of SiHa cells was evaluated by the MTT assay, apoptosis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential by flow cytometry, and pro-apoptotic related genes by Real-time quantitative PCR. Naringin showed a 50% inhibition of SiHa human cervical cancer cells at a concentration of 750μM. SiHa cells exhibited apoptotic cell death, intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation, morphological changes and decline in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In addition, administration of naringin increased the expression of caspases, p53 and Bax, Fas death receptor and its adaptor protein FADD. These results suggest that the induction of apoptosis by naringin is through both death-receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Taken together, our results suggest that naringin might be an effective agent to treat human cervical cancer.
Obliterative bronchiolitis after lung transplantation is characterized by airway inflammation leading to obliteration of small airways. Statins are known to have lipid-independent immunomodulatory properties. We investigated the effect of simvastatin treatment on innate and adaptive immune responses and the development of obliterative airway disease (OAD).
In fully MHC-mismatched rat tracheal allograft recipients, we used simvastatin at different doses (0.1 to 20 mg/kg/day orally) to assess its effect on OAD development. No immunosuppressive treatment was administered. Histologic, immunohistochemical and real-time RT-PCR analyses were performed 3, 10 and 30 days after transplantation.
Simvastatin treatment with doses ranging from 0.5 to 20 mg/kg/day significantly enhanced early epithelial recovery and reduced the development of OAD. No dose response was observed. Simvastatin treatment markedly reduced IL-23 mRNA and lymphocyte chemokine CCL20 production, and the infiltration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells into allografts already at 3 days. At 10 days, simvastatin significantly attenuated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, TNF-α, MCP-1 and IP-10, and Th17-polarizing cytokines, IL-6 and IL-17e, and inhibited allograft infiltration by inflammatory cells. The protective effects of simvastatin on inflammation and OAD were partially mediated through nitric oxide synthase.
Simvastatin treatment inhibited adaptive T-cell alloimmune activation as depicted by reduced expression of lymphocyte chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and reduced allograft infiltration by inflammatory cells. Importantly, simvastatin inhibits the development of OAD and this effect is partially mediated by increased nitric oxide activity. These results suggest a role for simvastatin in the prevention of obliterative bronchiolitis.
Intrathecal morphine is a widely used method for postoperative pain relief after major abdominal surgery. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded study was to compare intrathecal morphine and intravenous PCA morphine for postoperative analgesia and recovery course after major colorectal surgery in elderly patients.
After written informed consent, patients >70 years of age were prospectively and randomly assigned to receive either preoperative intrathecal morphine (0.3 mg) and postoperative patient-controlled (PCA) intravenous morphine (IT morphine) or PCA alone (group control). Results are presented as mean +/- SD (95% confidence interval).
Twenty-six patients successfully completed the study in each group. In the IT morphine group, rate of awakening was delayed. Pain intensity and daily intravenous morphine consumption were significantly reduced 1 and 2 days after surgery in the IT morphine group (P < .01). Mental function (assessed by Mini Mental State and Digit Symbol Substitution Test) was similar in both groups. Episodes of postoperative delirium/confusion occurred similarly in both groups. Time to ileus resolution and time to ambulation without assistance did not differ between the 2 groups. The duration of hospitalization was 8.4 +/- 1.7 (7-11) days and 7.9 +/- 2.0 (6-9.9) days for control and IT morphine, respectively (nonstatistical difference). Patients in the IT morphine group had longer time to awakening from anesthesia and experienced more sedation.
Intrathecal morphine, as compared with intravenous PCA morphine alone, improves immediate postoperative pain and reduces parenteral morphine consumption but does not improve postoperative recovery in elderly patients after major colorectal surgery.
Antidepressants are generally used for treatment of various mood and anxiety disorders. Several studies have shown the anti-tumor and cytotoxic activities of some antidepressants, but the underlying mechanisms were unclear. Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant and possesses a highly selective norepinephrine reuptake ability. We found that maprotiline decreased cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in Neuro-2a cells. Maprotiline induced apoptosis and increased caspase-3 activation. The activation of caspase-3 by maprotiline appears to depend on the activation of JNK and the inactivation of ERK. Maprotiline also induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases which involved the mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stored in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pretreatment with BAPTA/AM, a Ca(2+) chelator, suppressed maprotiline-induced ERK phosphorylation, enhanced caspase-3 activation and increased maprotiline-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, maprotiline induced apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells through activation of JNK-associated caspase-3 pathways. Maprotiline also evoked an anti-apoptotic response that was both Ca(2+)- and ERK-dependent.
The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of latent perhexiline-induced neuropathy in man. Several electrophysiological parameters were recorded and compared between a control group and a group of treated patients, without clinical evidence of neuropathy. The Hmax/Mmax amplitude ratio of the soleus H reflex was decreased in 2/3 of the patients. The H reflex latency was increased in 1/3 of them. The distal motor latencies of ulnar and popliteal nerves were increased in 1/4 of them. Only 1/3 of the patients treated did not show any electrophysiological abnormality. The validity of these results and the possible mechanisms involved are discussed.
Citrinin (CTN) and patulin (PAT) are fungal secondary metabolites which are found in food and feed and showed organotoxicity in mature animals. In this study zebrafish embryos were applied to investigate the developmental toxicity of CTN and PAT on embryonic kidney. In the presence of CTN and PAT, the gross morphology of kidneys from embryos with green fluorescent kidney (wt1b:GFP) was not apparently altered. Histological analysis of CTN-treated embryos indicated cystic glomerular and tubular lesions; a disorganized arrangement of renal cells was also found in the PAT-treated group. From the view point of renal function, dextran clearance abilities of embryos exposed to CTN and PAT were significantly reduced. The damaged renal function caused by CTN could be partially rescued by the administration of pentoxifylline, suggesting the reduction of glomerular blood flow contributes to CTN-induced renal dysfunction. Additionally, CTN induced the expression of proinflammation genes, including COX2a, TNF-α and IL-1β, but failed to modify the levels and distribution of wt1a transcript and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein. In summary, CTN and PAT caused profound nephrotoxicity in histological structure and biological function of zebrafish embryos; the inflammatory pathway and blood rheology may involve in CTN-induced renal impairment.
The toxicity of aminoglycosides including gentamicin (GEN), the most widely used drug in this category, is believed to be related to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney. Aminoguanidine (AG) is known as an effective antioxidant and its free radical scavenger effects may protect GEN-induced acute renal failure (ARF). Therefore, this study was focused on investigating the possible protective effect of AG against GEN-induced nephrotoxicity in an in vivo rat model. We investigated the effects of AG on GEN-induced changes in renal tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; nitric oxide (NO) generation; glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities; glutathione (GSH) content; serum creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Morphological changes in the kidney were also examined using light microscopy. GEN administration to control group rats increased renal MDA and NO levels but decreased GSH-Px, SOD, CAT activities and GSH content. AG administration with GEN injection resulted in significantly decreased MDA, NO generation and increased GSH-Px, SOD, CAT activities and GSH content when compared with GEN alone. Serum levels of Cr and BUN significantly increased as a result of nephrotoxicity. Also, AG significantly decreased Cr and BUN levels. Morphological changes in the kidney, including tubular necrosis, intracellular edema, glomerular and basement membrane alterations were evaluated qualitatively. Both biochemical findings and histopathological evidence showed that administration of AG reduced the GEN-induced kidney damage. We propose that AG acts in the kidney as a potent scavenger of free radicals to prevent the toxic effects of GEN both at the biochemical and histological level.
