The relation between the arteriolar diameters and hypertensive glomerulosclerosis was studied by using microvascular casts and histological evaluation. Spontaneously hypertensive rats 4 weeks of age were divided into three groups: nontreated, captopril (40 mg/kg/day)-treated, and trichlormethiazide (1 mg/kg/day) with hydralazine (20 mg/kg/day)-treated. Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. At 6 weeks old, the captopril-treated rats showed a lower blood pressure and a larger afferent arteriolar diameter compared with the control rats. At 20 weeks old, the nontreated group exhibited hypertension and a lower arteriolar diameter ratio (afferent to efferent, 0.89 versus 1.22 in control group) because of afferent constriction and efferent dilatation, seen equally in the outer and inner cortexes. Glomerulosclerosis was accentuated only in the inner cortex of the nontreated group (score, 63 versus 29 in control group). In the two treated rat groups, the blood pressure was reduced and arteriolar diameter ratios were similar to those in the control group (1.18 and 1.26). The sclerosis score in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats (score, 26) was lower than in the nontreated rats but not the captopril-treated rats (score, 36). These results indicated that 1) in the hypertensive rats, despite a reduced diameter ratio, glomerulosclerosis was more severe in the inner cortex; 2) two therapies reduced blood pressure and reversed the arteriolar changes, but a decrease in glomerulosclerosis was seen only in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats; and 3) for development of glomerulosclerosis, factors other than hemodynamics may be important in addition to intraglomerular pressure.
A 69 year old female with history of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation suffered from occipital apoplexy. Under treatment with amiodarone 600 mg daily and concomitant medication with beta-acetyldigoxine (0.1 mg daily) and bisoprolole (1.25 mg daily), significant QT-prolongation (max. 700 ms; QTc: 614 ms) could be documented. Out of normofrequent sinus rhythm but as well out of bradycardia, the patient developed repetitive short-lasting "torsade de pointes" tachycardias (320 bpm) which terminated spontaneously. Serum electrolytes, plasma levels of digoxine (1.76 ng/ml) and amiodarone (1.9 mcg/ml) were within therapeutic range. This case report is the first to describe induction of amiodarone-associated "torsade de pointes" tachycardia during concomitant beta-blocker and digitalis medication in a patient with atrial fibrillation and structural heart disease. This points towards an elevated risk for proarrhythmia under this triple therapy.
The purpose of this study was to report recurrent optic disc and retinal vasculitis in a patient with drug-induced urticarial vasculitis. Complete ophthalmological examination including fluorescein angiography and visual field examination were done. A 53-year-old woman with recurrent painful urticarial skin lesions following trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole usage had the clinical and histopathological diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis. Two years after cutaneous manifestations, she began to notice visual disturbances in both eyes that recurred at 1-year intervals. Her ophthalmological findings were consistent with recurrent vasculitis of the optic nerve and retina. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine resulted in the resolution of cutaneous and ocular manifestations. This patient demonstrates that recurrent occlusive vasculitis of the optic nerve and retina can occur in this rare disease. These patients should be examined periodically by ophthalmologists.
Paclitaxel (Taxol), a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat breast and ovarian tumors, has been reported to induce a predominantly sensory neuropathy. Co-treatment with neurotrophic factors and paclitaxel has been proposed for preventing or reversing paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. Prosaposin, the precursor of saposins A, B, C and D was recently identified as a neurotrophic factor and was reported to facilitate nerve regeneration in vivo. Peptides (prosaptides) encompassing the neurotrophic sequence located in the saposin C domain, have neurotrophic activity similar to the holoprotein (O'Brien et al. 1995). In the present study, we investigated the effect of a 14-mer prosaptide, TX14(A), or a 22-mer prosaptide, 769P, on paclitaxel-induced neutrotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Paclitaxel treatment (1 microM) decreased cell viability of both PC12 and Schwann cells. TX14(A) (10 nM) prevented paclitaxel-induced loss of cell viability in PC12 cells but not in Schwann cells. Systemic injections (i.p.) of paclitaxel (1.2 mg/kg/day) given five times per week for three weeks (cumulative dose 18 mg/kg) or given every third day (25, 12.5 and 12.5 mg/kg) for 10 ten days (cumulative dose 50 mg/kg) in adult rats induced thermal hypoalgesia that was not accompanied by morphological changes in the sciatic nerve or changes of nerve conduction velocity. Co-administration of paclitaxel with prosaptides (cumulative dose 3 or 10 mg/kg) prevented paclitaxel-induced thermal hypoalgesia. In the short-term high dose study, paclitaxel treated rats lost 10% of their body weight, had reduced erythrocyte counts, hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations which were not prevented by treatment with prosaptide. TX14(A) did not diminish paclitaxel cytotoxicity of breast cancer cells in vitro. These findings suggest that prosaptide prevents the neurotoxic effects of paclitaxel while not interfering with its anti-tumor activity.
Systemic vasodilators represent a new approach in the treatment of the acute and chronic heart failure, as they reduce the afterload acting on the aortic impedance and/or the venous return to the heart. Vasodilators have been classified as venodilators (nitrates), which reduce left ventricular filling pressure and relieve pulmonary congestion; arteriolar dilators (hydralazine, phentolamine) which enhance cardiac output; and balanced vasodilator (nitroprusside, prazosin), which dilate both resistance and capacitance vessels. While nitroprusside and phentolamine are used in the treatment of the acute myocardial infarction, nitrates, hydralazine and prazosin are used in the long term treatment of the chronic congestive heart failure. Presumably, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in increasing peripheric vascular resistance in congestive heart failure. For this reason the inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, such as captopril and teprotide, are also used. The treatment with vasodilators, recommended to patients with severe heart failure, is not an alternative to that with digitalis and diuretics: such a combination may in fact result as a very useful one.
The chloroform extract (active components from the exotic weed Trianthema portulacastrum L. of Aizoaceae, showed remarkable effect in the reduction of DENA-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatocarcinogenesis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by a single intraperitonial injection of diethylnitrosoamine (DENA) at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight. Chloroform extract of T. portulacastrum at a dose of 100 mg/kg/body wt. to the basal medium/per animal once daily was administered following DENA injection. Morphometric evaluation revealed that the fraction reduced the incidence, numerical preponderance, multiplicity and size distribution of visible pre-neoplastic nodules. Further focal lesions showed a reduction of altered liver cell foci/cm2 and a reduction of average focal area. A decrease in the percentage of liver parenchyma occupied by foci all seem to suggest the anticarcinogenic potential of Trianthema portulacastrum in DENA-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a critical mediator of many intracellular signaling systems. The activity of GSK3 is regulated by several kinases, with inactivation occurring via phosphorylation of the inhibitory serine-21 (alpha-isoform) and serine-9 (beta-isoform) residues. Here, we investigated whether acute cocaine administration regulates GSK3 activity and if inhibition of GSK3 by valproate or the selective GSK3 inhibitor SB 216763 would attenuate cocaine-induced behaviors in mice. Mice injected with cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) showed a reduction in the phosphorylation of GSK3beta in the caudate putamen, reflecting an increase in the activity of the kinase. To assess the role of GSK3 in cocaine-induced hyperactivity, mice were pretreated with valproate (50-300 mg/kg, i.p.), SB 216763 (0.25-7.5 mg/kg, i.p.), or the appropriate vehicle prior to saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Valproate or SB 216763 produced significant dose-dependent reductions in cocaine-induced ambulatory and stereotypic activity. Repeated administration of cocaine can result in an augmentation of the locomotor-stimulatory effects of the drug, a phenomenon referred to as sensitization. Mice pretreated with SB 216763 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to daily cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 days showed a significant attenuation of the development of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization following a cocaine challenge on day 13. These results indicate that cocaine activated GSK3beta in the caudate putamen and that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 reduced both the acute behavioral responses to cocaine and the long-term neuroadaptations produced by repeated cocaine, therefore suggesting a role for GSK3 in the behavioral and neurochemical manifestations associated with cocaine exposure.
This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of vancomycin serum concentration monitoring in patients with hematologic malignancies.
The study was designed as a prospective randomized study. Seventy immunocompromised febrile patients with hematologic malignancies were randomly assigned to either a vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring group (TDM group; n = 37) or to a control group (n = 33). Intervention in the TDM group involved patient follow-up by a clinical pharmacist to obtain and pharmacokinetically interpret serum vancomycin concentrations for dosage individualization.
Evaluation of all patients included global clinical response and nephrotoxicity, as well as the economic costs and effectiveness derived from the vancomycin monitoring program. There were no significant differences between the TDM and control groups in the outcome measures, except for the incidence of nephrotoxicity: the rates of minor nephrotoxicity were 33.3% and 13.5% in the control and TDM groups, respectively. The corresponding figures for moderate nephrotoxicity were 9.1% and 0%. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that TDM independently reduced the incidence of nephrotoxicity in this patient population. On the basis of this reduced nephrotoxicity, a incremental cost of $435 per case of nephrotoxicity prevented was found for vancomycin serum concentration monitoring.
A decreased incidence of nephrotoxicity provides evidence of a real clinical benefit to patient management in patients with hematologic malignancies. The TDM for vancomycin therapy in this high-risk population has been shown to be a cost-effective procedure.
To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist, valsartan, with a reference therapy, amlodipine.
One hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy. Patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks. Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates.
Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed. For the primary variable the difference was 0.5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan (p = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 1.7). Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66.7% for valsartan and 60.2% for amlodipine (p = 0.39). Both treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of drug-related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg valsartan; 3.6% for 5 mg amlodipine; 0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine; 14.3% for 10 mg amlodipine).
The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. The results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.
A deficiency of the muscle isoform of the enzyme, phosphofructokinase (PFK, EC 2.7.1.11), leads to an illness (glycogenosis, Type VII) characterized by myopathy and hemolysis. A patient with this disease and an affected sister were found to have a G to A substitution at the 5' donor site of intron 5 of the PFK-M gene. This mutation led to a splicing defect: a complete deletion of the preceding exon in the patient's mRNA. The patient, an affected sister, and related and unrelated family members, who were of Ashkenazic Jewish background, were screened for the mutation by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and by allele specific hybridization of genomic DNA. The affected sisters are homozygous for the mutation, and their children, who are unaffected, are heterozygous. The only previously characterized genetic defect in this disease, found in a Japanese patient, was a G to T mutation at the beginning of intron 15 with splicing to a cryptic site within exon 15 (1). Both mutations lead to inframe deletions, but of different parts of the protein. The differences between the two aberrant proteins may account for clinical differences between our patients and the Japanese patient.
Skeletal muscle tremor is the most common side effect when giving the relatively selective beta2-adrenergic-stimulators. Tachycardia is a side effect which limits dosage in a few patients only. Dose-reponse relation was tested on ventilatory capacity, heart rate, blood pressure and skeletal muscle tremor after terbutaline was given intravenously and as an aerosol. Terbutaline infusions in doses exceeding the recommended therapeutic level did not produce maximal relaxation of the bronchial muscle in patients with endogenous asthma, but increased the heart rate by 25 beats per minute and more than doubled the tremor. The tachycardia is mainly due to peripheral vasodilation and reflexogenic heart stimulation. Terbutaline given by inhalation produced the same bronchial relaxation without any effect on heart rate, blood pressure of tremor, indicating a local effect. The acute margin of safety was notable; the increase of pulse after 63 inhalations of this long-acting substance being only 16 beats per minutes.
It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients. Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction, such as fasting, may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period. Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms. Of those, 13 (26%) developed biliary pathology. Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age, sex, duration of the treatment and starvation variables. After cessation of the treatment, pseudolithiasis resolved spontaneously within a short period. The incidence of pseudolithiasis is not affected by fasting.
Desferrioxamine (DFO) is the most important drug in the treatment of thalassemia major and other hematological diseases requiring regular transfusion. It eliminates excessive ferritin by building up chelate complexes. Different mechanisms of possible DFO toxicity are induction of oxidation, damage of the blood-retina barrier, or reduction in other metalloions (Cu2+, Zn2+). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ocular side effects of DFO treatment. We prospectively examined 17 patients aged 5 to 25 years, all of them treated with DFO. Visual acuity, pupillary reaction, anterior segment, lens and fundus were checked. If possible, visual fields, color vision, dark adaptation, stereoscopic vision, and contrast sensitivity were investigated. Lens opacities were found in 41% (7/17), changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in 35% (6/17), tortuosity of retinal vessels in 24% (4/17), dilation and sheathing of the retinal vessels in 18% (3/17), defects in color vision in 29% (5/17), and abnormal dark adaptation in 18% (3/17) of the patients. The oculotoxicity of DFO is dose-dependent. Major side effects like depression of the visual acuity are partially reversible after discontinuing the therapy. Regular ophthalmological check-ups are therefore necessary.
The study deals with the development of increased resistance of the rat myocardium to ISO-induced injury after pretreatment with the same drug. Reduced sensitivity already developed after the first dose of ISO, whose effect was only slightly increased by subsequent repeated doses. The development of myocardial injury was completed significantly sooner in pretreated animals, and this resulted in a decrease of the extent of the lesion. The reduction of cardiotoxic effect of ISO could be achieved by pretreatment with very small doses of ISO (0.01 mg/kg). An increase in the pretreatment dose augmented the protective effect and, in particular, prolonged the duration of reduced sensitivity. The effect of pretreatment in older animals, which responded to ISO by greater damage, was more pronounced.
We measured the effective renal plasma flow, the glomerular filtration rate and the fractional excretion of sodium under low and high sodium intakes in the normotensive offspring of hypertensives and in essential hypertensive patients. During the high sodium intake, 57% of the offspring and 42% of the hypertensive patients showed an increase in effective renal plasma flow and fractional excretion of sodium. In the remaining hypertensives, enalapril improved the renal haemodynamic and sodium-handling responses. Enalapril also reduced the blood pressure in all hypertensives, whether they showed a normal or an abnormal response to a high sodium intake. In the hypertensive patients with an abnormal response to a high sodium intake, the intra-erythrocyte sodium content was higher than in the normal responders. Thus, abnormal renal haemodynamic and sodium-handling responses to a high sodium intake were observed in 50% of the hypertensive patients and the offspring. The high intra-erythrocyte sodium content observed in the hypertensive patients suggests that extrarenal alterations in sodium handling were present.
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when genetically altered by mutation, amplification, chromosomal translocation or inversion, has been shown to play an oncogenic role in certain cancers. Small molecule inhibitors targeting the kinase activity of ALK have proven to be effective therapies in certain ALK-driven malignancies and one such inhibitor, crizotinib, is now approved for the treatment of EML4-ALK-driven, non-small cell lung cancer. In neuroblastoma, activating point mutations in the ALK kinase domain can drive disease progression, with the two most common mutations being F1174L and R1275Q. We report here crystal structures of the ALK kinase domain containing the F1174L and R1275Q mutations. Also included are crystal structures of ALK in complex with novel small molecule ALK inhibitors, including a classic type II inhibitor, that stabilize previously unobserved conformations of the ALK activation loop. Collectively, these structures illustrate a different series of activation loop conformations than has been observed in previous ALK crystal structures and provide insight into the activating nature of the R1275Q mutation. The novel active site topologies presented here may also aid the structure-based drug design of a new generation of ALK inhibitors.
We investigated the possible therapeutic effect of irreversible proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib against hepatocellular carcinoma induced chemically by chronic administration of diethylnitrosoamines (DENA). Hepatocellular carcinoma induced by DENA in male Wistar rats was manifested biochemically by significant elevation of serum α-feto protein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). In addition, hepatic cancer was further confirmed by a significant increase in hepatic tissue growth factors; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Moreover a marked increase in matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) content were also observed, along with a profound decrease in hepatic endostatin and metallothionein level. Treatment of rats with the selected doses of carfilzomib produced a significant protection against hepatic cancer. The present results claimed that chosen doses of carfilzomib succeeded in suppressing serum tumor markers level AFP and CEA. Furthermore, the drug reduced the elevated level of hepatic growth factors, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 induced by the carcinogen. The antitumor effect of carfilzomib was also accompanied by augmentation of hepatic content of endostatin and metallothionein. Histopathological examination of liver tissues also correlated with the biochemical observations. It could be concluded that treatment with carfilzomib confers a possible antitumor effect against hepatocellular carcinoma induced by DENA model in rats.
Captopril inhibits the metabolism of endogenous opioids in vitro and potentiates their effects in vivo. We examined the hypothesis that endogenous opioids contribute to the actions of captopril in man. The acute cardiovascular and autonomic effects of oral captopril, intravenous naloxone, and their combination were examined in eight healthy men with normotension in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a Latin squares design. Naloxone altered neither blood pressure nor heart rate. There were significant falls in systolic blood pressure during captopril dosing alone, but there was no fall in blood pressure during combination therapy. Heart rates were higher during the combination than during captopril alone. The combination caused sedation, but neither captopril nor naloxone alone had any behavioral effects. Modification of the acute circulatory effects of captopril by naloxone suggests a role for endogenous opioids in the responses to converting enzyme inhibition. The sedation caused by the combination raises the possibility that captopril may exert central nervous actions in man.
A greater MAC fraction of nitrous oxide than isoflurane is required to prevent response to verbal commands and suppress the capacity to learn. Speculating that this difference between these agents may be caused by nitrous oxide's capacity to increase sympathetic activity, we tested the hypothesis that nitrous oxide may antagonize the suppression of learning found with isoflurane.
We administered a combination of isoflurane and nitrous oxide at three subanesthetic test concentrations (0.43, 0.56, and 0.68 MAC) to 24 healthy male volunteers. Assuming additivity of the anesthetics, the first test concentration was selected to suppress learning of new information by 50% (ED50 for suppression of learning); the second concentration, to suppress the ability to respond appropriately to verbal command by 50% (MAC-awake); and the third, to provide 1.4 times MAC-awake. Three tests of learning were applied. At each test concentration, we provided 7 answers to "trivial pursuit"-type questions, resulting in a set of 21 answered questions for each volunteer; an additional 7 unanswered questions served as controls. At the highest test concentration, each volunteer also heard two examples from each of two categories (4 words) repeated 30 times (the category-example task), and a message instructing them to touch either their nose or their ear during a specified interval in the postanesthetic interview (the behavior task).
The MAC-awake value for the combination of isoflurane and nitrous oxide was 118 +/- 4% of the expected value (i.e., the two anesthetics were antagonistic for this effect). Consistent with antagonism, the anesthetic concentration predicted to suppress learning by 50% permitted significantly more learning, and the ED50 was 105 +/- 2% of that predicted. Neither the category task nor the behavior task demonstrated evidence of learning at 1.4 times MAC-awake.
Our results are consistent with an antagonism between nitrous oxide and isoflurane; however, the degree of antagonism is small.
We present a 53-year-old female with pulmonary embolism (PE), who had been taking oral contraceptive for 13 years. She was admitted to our hospital with upper abdominal pain and was found to be in shock. The diagnosis of PE was made from chest X-ray examination, electrocardiogram and pulmonary angiography. Pulmonary hypertension was observed on right heart catheterization, and an anticoagulant was administered. Multiple defects of the right pulmonary artery were detected on lung perfusion scan, and there were no significant findings on leg phlebogram. Home oxygen therapy was effective for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and chronic hypoxemia which still persisted after her recovery from the acute stage. We are concerned that wide spread use of oral contraceptives will increase the incidence of PE in the near future in this country. We conclude that contraceptive users should be warned of their higher risk of PE, and that they should visit a clinic for examination.
We investigated the distribution of nephrin by immunofluorescence microscopy in renal biopsies of patients with nephrotic syndrome: 13 with membranous glomerulonephritis (GN), 10 with minimal change GN, and seven with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. As control, six patients with IgA GN without nephrotic syndrome and 10 normal controls were studied. We found an extensive loss of staining for nephrin and a shift from a podocyte-staining pattern to a granular pattern in patients with nephrotic syndrome, irrespective of the primary disease. In membranous GN, nephrin was co-localized with IgG immune deposits. In the attempt to explain these results, we investigated in vitro whether stimuli acting on the cell cytoskeleton, known to be involved in the pathogenesis of GN, may induce redistribution of nephrin on the surface of human cultured podocytes. Aggregated but not disaggregated human IgG(4), plasmalemmal insertion of membrane attack complex of complement, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and puromycin, induced the shedding of nephrin with a loss of surface expression. This phenomenon was abrogated by cytochalasin and sodium azide. These results suggest that the activation of cell cytoskeleton may modify surface expression of nephrin allowing a dislocation from plasma membrane to an extracellular site.
AKXD recombinant inbred strains of mice have proven to be very useful in the identification of potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors involved in the development of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. In these tumors, the hematopoietic insertion of an active AKV murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is associated with the onset of disease. Common sites of retroviral insertion (CIS) identify genes causally associated with the development or initiation of lymphoma.
In the present study, we analyzed a previously uncharacterized CIS, Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 32 (Evi32), which is located on mouse chromosome 1. We analyzed candidate genes in the region to identify those involved in Evi32 mediated oncogenesis.
Here we show that proviral insertion at Evi32 correlates with significant overexpression of a putative transcription factor, PR-domain containing 14 (Prdm14). Tumors with insertions at Evi32 are consistently lymphoid in nature. Prdm14 is normally expressed early in embryonic development with the highest expression in undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells. This study implicates Prdm14 as a proto-oncogene involved in lymphoblastic lymphoma formation.
Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), an aggressive and mostly lethal malignancy, is known to be resistant to a number of drug stimuli. Here, we demonstrated that arsenic trioxide inhibited the proliferation of gallbladder carcinoma in vivo and in vitro as well as the transcription of cell cycle-related protein Cyclin D1. And, Cyclin D1 overexpression inhibited the negative role of arsenic trioxide in cell cycle progression. We further explored the mechanisms by which arsenic trioxide affected Cyclin D1 transcription and found that the Sp1 transcription factor was down-regulated by arsenic trioxide, with a corresponding decrease in Cyclin D1 promoter activity. Taken together, these results suggested that arsenic trioxide inhibited gallbladder carcinoma cell proliferation via down-regulation of Cyclin D1 transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner, which provided a new mechanism of arsenic trioxide-involved cell proliferation and may have important therapeutic implications in gallbladder carcinoma patients.
The influence of some noradrenergic, 5-hydroxytryptaminergic and cholinergic agents on imipramine-induced seizures were investigated in mice. DL-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS) and pargyline significantly potentiated imipramine-induced seizures. Phentolamine and prazosin significantly attenuated seizures elicited by imipramine and significantly attenuated the seizure-enhancing effect of DOPs. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine and reserpine significantly attenuated seizures induced by imipramine. Disulfiram significantly protected mice against imipramine-induced seizures. However, DOPS significantly potentiated seizures induced by imipramine in disulfiram-pretreated animals. Clonidine effectively protected mice against imipramine-induced seizures. Idazoxan, on the other hand, significantly potentiated seizures induced by imipramine and significantly antagonised the protective effect of clonidine against the seizures. 5-HTP, PCPA, cyproheptadine, mianserin, ketanserin and trazodone did not affect imipramine-induced seizures to any significant extent. Physostigmine antagonised seizures induced by imipramine while atropine significantly potentiated the seizures, and significantly attenuated the protective effect of physostigmine against the seizures. These data suggest that enhancement and attenuation of central noradrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmissions respectively, and not 5-HT mechanisms, may underlie imipramine-induced seizures in mice.
