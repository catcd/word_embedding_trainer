Mesangial cell proliferation is found in many forms of progressive renal disease. This proliferation may be due to dysregulation of mesangial cell growth. The studies presented here test the hypothesis that the normal glomerulus produces a regulator of mesangial cell growth. Conditioned media (CM) from primary glomerular cultures were able to inhibit rat mesangial cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, from 30.0 +/- 3.8 to 86.6 +/- 3.9% growth inhibition. The growth inhibitor in glomerular CM appears to have a molecular weight of less than 3,000. Glomerular CM caused significantly more growth inhibition than did 3T3 fibroblast CM, 77.9 +/- 2.8% growth inhibition by 10% glomerular CM versus 21.2 +/- 5.4% by 10% 3T3 CM (P < 0.001). The growth inhibition was completely reversible. Glomerular CM had no effect on the growth of 3T3 fibroblasts. Treatment of the glomerular CM with either trypsin or neutral protease had no effect on its growth inhibitory activity. Glomerular CM obtained from rats with puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis caused significantly less growth inhibition than did control glomerular CM; at a concentration of 10% CM, control glomerular CM had 65.1 +/- 1.9% growth inhibition and puromycin had 45.4 +/- 2.1% (P < 0.001). Thus, the rat glomerulus produces a small, nonprotein inhibitor of rat mesangial cell growth and the activity of this inhibitor is reduced in puromycin nephrosis. Impairment of mesangial cell growth regulation may be important in the pathogenesis of progressive renal disease.
We present magnetic resonance imaging findings of a 5-year-old girl who had a rapidly installing hemolytic anemia crisis induced by trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole, resulting in cerebral anoxia leading to permanent damage. Magnetic Resonance imaging revealed cortical laminar necrosis in arterial border zones in both cerebral hemispheres, ischemic changes in subcortical white matter of left cerebral hemisphere, and in the left putamen. Although cortical laminar necrosis is a classic entity in adulthood related to conditions of energy depletions, there are few reports available in children. A wide review of the literature is also presented.
Several drugs and techniques have been used to reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). However PONV continues to be a common postoperative complication. Midazolam premedication in pediatric patients has been reported to reduce the incidence of PONV. In the present study the effect of intravenous midazolam premedication on the incidence and severity of PONV was investigated in a sample of adult patients undergoing anesthesia for cholecystectomy.
Eighty-two adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for cholecystectomy were randomly divided into two groups to receive either midazolam 75 microg/kg or a same volume of normal saline intravenously fifteen minutes prior to induction of anesthesia. Incidence and severity of PONV together with the total amount of administered metoclopramide during the first postoperative day were compared between two groups.
Severity of nausea was significantly lightened in midazolam group during the first six hours after recovery period compared with placebo group (3.7 +/- 1.6 of a ten point visual analog scale vs. 4.9 +/- 2.2 in placebo group; P < 0.05). Mean number of vomiting episodes was significantly lower in midazolam group (0.4 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.1 +/- 1.4 in placebo group; P < 0.05). Midazolam group received a significantly less amount of metoclopramide during the first postoperative day (2.1 +/- 3.7 mg vs. 5.3 +/- 6.8 mg in placebo group; P < 0.05).
The results of this study suggest the effectiveness of prophylactic intravenous midazolam premedication to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Possible mechanisms for this effect of midazolam may be GABA receptor antagonism, inhibition of dopamine release, and anxiolytic effects.
The inducible nitric oxide synthase isoform (iNOS) is upregulated by cytokines and endotoxins in many types of cells, including cardiac myocytes. Nitric oxide (NO) induced by cytokines can be cytotoxic, and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and septic shock. To examine the role of iNOS in the ischemic myocardium, we studied: 1) the time course of expression of iNOS mRNA after myocardial infarction (MI) in male Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and expression of iNOS protein in the infarcted region; 2) whether hypoxia in vitro is a potential mediator of the induction of iNOS mRNA; and 3) whether inhibition of iNOS by two different selective inhibitors (aminoguanidine and S-methylisothiourea sulfate) in vivo influences infarct size. Myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and tissue was collected at selected times thereafter from both ligated and sham-operated rats. iNOS mRNA was induced in the infarcted region of the left ventricle for 7 days; iNOS protein was also detected in the infarcted area. We next tested whether hypoxia would induce iNOS in vitro. In cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes, iNOS mRNA was slightly induced by 6 to 24 h of hypoxia; however, iNOS protein was only detected when the cytokine interleukin-1beta was present. To study whether iNOS activity contributed to myocardial damage (eg, infarct size), we administered the first dose of the NOS inhibitors 24 h before LAD occlusion and then a second dose after surgery. Inhibition of iNOS activity with aminoguanidine reduced infarct size by 20% but had no effect on infiltration by neutrophils, whereas the more selective inhibitor S-methylisothiourea sulfate reduced infarct size by 41%. These data suggest that NO derived from the iNOS isoform contributes to some of the myocardial injury following MI, possibly by causing myocardial cell death in areas bordering the ischemic region of the heart.
During autopsy, an 11-year-old girl with acute lymphocytic leukemia was found to have hepatic fibrosis with a 2.5-cm nodule of hepatocarcinoma. For 5 1/2 of the six years of treatment, chemotherapy consisted of daily orally administered methotrexate with monthly doses of vincristine sulfate and prednisone. The cumulative dose of methotrexate was 2.5 g. To our knowledge, this report constitutes the first association of hepatoma with methotrexate-induced hepatic fibrosis. A careful follow-up of patients receiving methotrexate for malignant neoplasms is urged; caution is suggested in the prolonged use of methotrexate when treating benign disease.
A plasma acetaminophen (INN, paracetamol) half-life of more than 4 hours has been correlated with hepatotoxicity in acetaminophen overdosing not treated with an antidote. Acetaminophen half-life has not been studied in patients receiving the antidote N -acetylcysteine.
Prospectively, 112 patients with acetaminophen overdosage all treated with intravenous N -acetylcysteine were studied. A minimum of 2 plasma acetaminophen values >20 micromol/L were available for calculation of acetaminophen half-life, assuming first-order kinetics.
Overall, the median acetaminophen half-life was 5.4 hours (range, 0.8-119.7 hours). Forty-eight patients with no or little hepatotoxicity (ALT <1000 U/L), 43 patients with hepatotoxicity without encephalopathy, and 21 patients with hepatotoxicity and encephalopathy had acetaminophen half-lives of 3.0 hours (range, 0.8-10.0 hours), 6.4 hours (range, 1.3-19.0 hours), and 18.4 hours (range, 4.6-119.7 hours), respectively (P <.001). An acetaminophen half-life >4 hours was observed in 71 patients, and 56 of those (79%) had hepatotoxicity (ALT >1000 U/L or coma). Thirty-three of 41 patients (81%) with an acetaminophen half-life <4 hours had no hepatotoxicity. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that an acetaminophen half-life of 5.5 hours provided better discrimination; hepatotoxicity was therefore present in 49 of 54 patients with an acetaminophen half-life >5.5 hours (positive predictive value, 91%) and in 15 of 58 patients with a half-life below this limit (negative predictive value, 74%) despite treatment with N -acetylcysteine.
Acetaminophen half-life correlates well with the degree of liver damage in patients treated with the antidote N-acetylcysteine. Longer half-lives reflect a greater toxic effect on the liver.
Many cyanobacterial species are able to produce cyanotoxins as secondary metabolites. Among them, microcystins (MC) are a group of around 80 congeners of toxic cyclic heptapeptides. MC-LR is the most studied MC congener, in view of its high acute hepatotoxicity and tumor promoting activity. Humans may be exposed to cyanotoxins through several routes, the oral one being the most important. The accepted pathway for MC-LR detoxication and excretion in the urine is GSH conjugation. The GSH adduct (GS-MCLR) formation has been shown to occur spontaneously and enzymatically, catalyzed by glutathione transferases (GSTs). The enzymatic reaction has been reported but not characterized both in vitro and in vivo in animal and plant species. No data are available on humans. In the present work, the MC-LR conjugation with GSH catalyzed by five recombinant human GSTs (A1-1, A3-3, M1-1, P1-1, and T1-1) has been characterized for the first time. All GSTs are able to catalyze the reaction; kinetic parameters K(m), k(cat), and their relative specific activities to form GS-MCLR were derived (T1-1 > A1-1 > M1-1 > A3-3 ≫ P1-1). In the range of MC tested concentrations used (0.25-50 μM) GSTT1-1 and A1-1 showed a typical saturation curve with similar affinity for MC-LR (≈80 μM; k(cat) values 0.18 and 0.10 min(-1), respectively), A3-3 and M1-1 were linear, whereas GSTP1-1 showed a temperature-dependent sigmoidal allosteric curve with a k(cat) = 0.11 min(-1). The enzymes mainly expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, GSTA1-1, T1-1, and M1-1, seemed to be mainly involved in the MC-LR detoxification after oral exposure, whereas P1-1 kinetics and location in the skin suggest a role related to dermal exposure. Considering the high frequency of some GST polymorphism, especially M1 and T1 gene deletion, with complete loss in activity, this information could be the first step to identify groups of individual at higher risk associated with MC exposure.
1. Regional haemodynamic responses to i.v. bolus injections of low doses (4 pmol and 40 pmol) of endothelin-1, -2, -3 and sarafotoxin-S6b were assessed in conscious, Long Evans rats in the absence and presence of indomethacin. 2. Both doses of endothelin-3 and sarafotoxin-S6b caused early renal vasodilatations that were not affected by indomethacin. Endothelin-1 caused an initial renal vasodilatation only in the presence of indomethacin, indicating that this peptide produced concurrent release of cyclo-oxygenase products that caused renal vasoconstriction. Neither dose of endothelin-2 produced an increase in renal conductance. 3. The 4 pmol dose of all four peptides caused mesenteric vasoconstrictions only. With the 40 pmol dose of the peptides, none caused early mesenteric vasoconstriction except in the presence of indomethacin. Thus, in this vascular bed the primary vasoconstrictor effects of the peptides (seen with the 4 pmol dose) were offset, following the 40 pmol dose, by release of vasodilator cyclo-oxygenase products. Indomethacin alone caused significant vasoconstriction only in the mesenteric vascular bed, indicating that in this region of the circulation, vasodilator prostanoids might be involved also in the tonic control of vascular conductance. 4. All four peptides at both doses caused early hindquarters vasodilatation. However, only the initial hypotensive and hindquarters vasodilator effects of the 40 pmol dose of sarafotoxin-S6b were attenuated by indomethacin. Under these conditions the hindquarters vasodilator effects of sarafotoxin-S6b were similar to those of the other peptides, indicating that the more marked effects of sarafotoxin-S6b in the absence of indomethacin were contributed to by vasodilator cyclo-oxygenase products in the hindquarters.
Depression is an extremely common illness in the elderly, and is, at times, refractory to the usual therapies. The elderly are also particularly prone to develop toxic side effects from standard antidepressive agents. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are rarely used in this population, although much evidence and clinical experience would indicate that they can be extremely effective and non-toxic. This paper outlines the indications and precautions for use and side effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the treatment of depression in elderly patients.
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) are related lymphomas sharing pathological, molecular and clinical characteristics. Here we discovered by whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing recurrent somatic coding-sequence mutations in the PTPN1 gene. Mutations were found in 6 of 30 (20%) Hodgkin lymphoma cases, in 6 of 9 (67%) Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cell lines, in 17 of 77 (22%) PMBCL cases and in 1 of 3 (33%) PMBCL-derived cell lines, consisting of nonsense, missense and frameshift mutations. We demonstrate that PTPN1 mutations lead to reduced phosphatase activity and increased phosphorylation of JAK-STAT pathway members. Moreover, silencing of PTPN1 by RNA interference in Hodgkin lymphoma cell line KM-H2 resulted in hyperphosphorylation and overexpression of downstream oncogenic targets. Our data establish PTPN1 mutations as new drivers in lymphomagenesis.
The involvement of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent neurons in cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis has been investigated in rats. CYP (150 mg/kg) was administered 48 h before testing in both vehicle- and capsaicin- (50 mg/kg s.c., 4 days before) treated rats. Some experiments were also performed 96 h after bilateral removal of pelvic ganglia to produce bladder denervation. CYP administration produced a marked detrusor hyperreflexia which was abolished by capsaicin pretreatment, demonstrating that it is mediated through stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons. CYP administration was followed by a marked increase in bladder weight and plasma protein extravasation (measured by the Evans blue leakage technique). The latter effect was largely prevented by ganglionectomy but was aggravated by capsaicin pretreatment. The effect of capsaicin was suppressed by ganglionectomy. Isolated strips of detrusor muscle from CYP-treated animals developed less tension in response to various stimuli as compared to strips from vehicle-treated animals; however, when contractile responses were expressed as percentage of an internal standard (carbachol-induced contraction) no difference was evident between the two groups. The bladder content of calcitonin gene-related peptide, used as a marker of the bladder afferent fibres that are capsaicin-sensitive in adult rats, was slightly reduced as compared to controls, but the difference can be accounted for by the increased bladder weight. We conclude that CYP-induced cystitis is not accompanied by a toxic effect on bladder nerves and that the decrease in bladder capacity is entirely mediated through stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibres, presumably linked to the formation of the irritant metabolite of CYP, acrolein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The outcome of the respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function tests and bronchial hyperresponsiveness was studied in forty-seven workers with respiratory disease due to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (twenty-seven asthmatic and twenty non-asthmatic subjects) after about 2 years from the first examination. Eight of twelve asthmatic subjects who left the industry after the first examination complained at the follow-up of dyspnoea and wheezing, but pulmonary function tests were unchanged; bronchial hyperresponsiveness decreased in three, but most were still positive to challenge test with bethanechol at the follow-up. Fifteen subjects who continued their exposure to TDI showed at the follow-up a significant decrease of the spirometric parameters and an increase of the bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and symptoms of chronic bronchitis were more frequent at the second examination. Non-asthmatic subjects, both exposed and non-exposed to TDI at the second examination, showed a significant decrease of the pulmonary function tests but no relevant changes in bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Our data suggest that stopping occupational exposure to TDI frequently did not produce an improvement of the TDI bronchial asthma, and persistence of the occupational exposure causes a more rapid decline in the respiratory function.
A specific IgE-mediated response was evaluated in twenty-eight workers exposed to TDI or MDI, with diagnosis of occupational asthma and positive to bronchial provocative challenge. The presence of anti-diisocyanate IgE was observed in 27% of subjects exposed to TDI and 83% of those exposed to MDI, particularly in individuals who experienced an acute massive exposure. An immediate-type response to bronchial provocative test was found in 66% of individuals with specific antibodies. Specific IgE are prevalent (91%) in subjects who developed symptoms before 6 years of exposure to isocyanates. The results suggest an association between the presence of specific IgE, early asthmatic symptoms and heavy episodic exposure.
Despite the high heritability of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, a genetic diagnosis can be established in only a minority of patients. Known genetic causes include chromosomal aberrations, such as the duplication of the 15q11-13 region, and monogenic causes, as in Rett and fragile-X syndromes. The genetic heterogeneity within ASD is striking, with even the most frequent causes responsible for only 1% of cases at the most. Even with the recent developments in next-generation sequencing, for the large majority of cases no molecular diagnosis can be established. Here, we report ten patients with ASD and other shared clinical characteristics, including intellectual disability and facial dysmorphisms caused by a mutation in ADNP, a transcription factor involved in the SWI/SNF remodeling complex. We estimate this gene to be mutated in at least 0.17% of ASD cases, making it one of the most frequent ASD-associated genes known to date.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease. To elucidate the molecular basis of NAFLD, we performed an exome-wide association study of liver fat content. Three variants were associated with higher liver fat levels at the exome-wide significance level of 3.6 × 10(-7): two in PNPLA3, an established locus for NAFLD, and one (encoding p.Glu167Lys) in TM6SF2, a gene of unknown function. The TM6SF2 variant encoding p.Glu167Lys was also associated with higher circulating levels of alanine transaminase, a marker of liver injury, and with lower levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides and alkaline phosphatase in 3 independent populations (n > 80,000). When recombinant protein was expressed in cultured hepatocytes, 50% less Glu167Lys TM6SF2 protein was produced relative to wild-type TM6SF2. Adeno-associated virus-mediated short hairpin RNA knockdown of Tm6sf2 in mice increased liver triglyceride content by threefold and decreased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion by 50%. Taken together, these data indicate that TM6SF2 activity is required for normal VLDL secretion and that impaired TM6SF2 function causally contributes to NAFLD.
Magnesium (Mg) has been proposed to take part in biochemical dysregulation contributing to psychiatric disorders. The aims of this study was to estimate acute behavioural responses to clonidine (0.1 mg/kg i.p.), d-amphetamine (5 mg/kg, i.p), arecoline (15 mg/kg i.p), nicotine (6 mg/kg i.p.), apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg i.p.) and L-5-hydroxytryptophan (300 mg/kg i.p.) in rats fed with Mg-deprivated diet for 49 days and then treated with organic and inorganic Mg salts (50 mg Mg per kg) ether alone or in combination with pyridoxine (5 mg vitamin B6 per kg). In our study Mg-deficient rats were more sensitive to d-amphetamine-induced motor stereotypes compared with control rats; time of onset of the stereotypies insignificantly decreased by 14.89% and duration of the stereotypies significantly increased by 19.44% (320.36 +/- 19.90 vs. 268.23 +/- 8.17 minutes; p = 0.043). Mg deficiency did not modulate sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizure. The time between nicotine injection and emergence of clonic seizure (seizure latency) in the controls and Mg-deficient rats were 0.80 +/- 0.26 and 0.96 +/- 0.21 minutes respectively. Duration of the seizures in the controls and Mg-deficient rats were 64.93 +/- 7.20 and 79.32 +/- 8.13 minutes. In our study, Mg deficiency did not affect on clonidine- and apomorphine-induced hypothermia. Clonidine produced similar decreases in rectal temperature in controls and Mg-deficient group. In experiments using apomorphine, values of hypothermia were similar to those observed with clonidine. Mg deficiency antagonized 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head-twitch response. The number of head twitches produced by 5-hydroxytryptophan was significantly (p = 0.49) decreased: twofold in magnesium-deficient rats (1.23 +/- 0.44 per minute) as compared with controls (2.42 +/- 0.52 per minute). Arecoline-induced tremor was comparably less expressed in Mg-deficient rats than in controls. The time between arecoline injection and time of onset of the tremor in the controls and Mg-deficient rats were 92.75 +/- 19.35 and 245.17 +/- 121.86 seconds respectively (p < or = 0.035). Duration of the tremors in the controls and Mg-deficient rats were 1175.58 +/- 127.87 and 703.83 +/- 89.33 seconds (p = 0.015). Magnesium salts (Mg chloride, Mg L-aspartate alone and in combination with B6) were administered through gastric tube during twenty days up to complete compensation oferythrocyte and plasma Mg levels in all experimental groups. In our study administration of Mg salts resulted in normalization of acute behavioural responses in Mg-deficient rats to d-amphetamine, arecoline, and L-5-hydroxytryptophan. Behavioural responses in rats treated with both Mg chloride and Mg L-aspartate in combinations with B6 were comparable with those observed in MagneB6 treatment.
The two major hypotheses for the pathogenesis of amphotericin nephrotoxicity are direct interaction with epithelial cell membranes and vasoconstriction. Studies indicating the special vulnerability of the medullary ray and medulla to hypoxia led to a reexamination of amphotericin nephrotoxicity. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups: amphotericin injection (5 mg/kg daily for 3 wk), amphotericin plus salt depletion, vehicle, and salt depletion and vehicle. The amphotericin group had polyuria (P < 0.01) but normal serum creatinine. In contrast, amphotericin plus salt depletion rats exhibited renal failure (creatinine of 1.49 +/- 0.05 versus amphotericin alone 0.98 +/- 0.01; P < 0.01). Semiquantitative histologic analysis of cortical and medullary injury correlated with functional impairment. Cortical changes in the amphotericin group were largely restricted to the medullary ray, where focal rupture and calcification of thick ascending limbs were noted. The S2/S3 tubules in the medullary rays showed focally diminished cell complexity with histiocytic/lymphocytic infiltration. However, calcification was also seen in the area of the macula densa. Morphometry revealed that the thick ascending limbs in the medulla were hypertrophied (1,420 +/- 63 versus 1,195 +/- 48 microns 2 for vehicle; P < 0.05). In contrast, in the amphotericin and salt depletion group, the changes in the medullary ray extended to the labyrinth and the thick ascending limbs in the inner stripe showed atrophic changes (772 +/- 23 microns 2; P < 0.01 versus vehicle). Thus, changes as a result of amphotericin toxicity take place both in areas known to be most vulnerable to hypoxia (medullary ray and medulla), and in areas rich in oxygen (adjacent to glomerulus). Salt depletion potentiates the cortical changes and converts medullary hypertrophy to atrophy. These findings support a dual pathogenesis for amphotericin nephropathy (direct toxicity and vasoconstriction).
Heparan sulfate (HS) in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is important for regulation of the charge-dependent permeability. Heparanase has been implicated in HS degradation in several proteinuric diseases. This study analyzed the role of heparanase in HS degradation in Adriamycin nephropathy (AN), a model of chronic proteinuria-induced renal damage. Expression of heparanase, HS, and the core protein of agrin (to which HS is attached) was determined on kidney sections from rats with AN in different experiments. First, expression was examined in a model of unilateral AN in a time-course study at 6-wk intervals until week 30. Second, rats were treated with the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea (DMTU) during bilateral AN induction. Finally, 6 wk after AN induction, rats were treated with angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonist (AT1A) or vehicle for 2 wk. Heparanase expression was increased in glomeruli of rats with AN, which correlated with HS reduction at all time points and in all experiments. Treatment with DMTU prevented the increased heparanase expression, the loss of GBM HS, and reduced albuminuria. Finally, treatment of established proteinuria with AT1A significantly reduced heparanase expression and restored glomerular HS. In conclusion, an association between heparanase expression and reduction of glomerular HS in AN was observed. The effects of DMTU suggest a role for reactive oxygen species in upregulation of heparanase. Antiproteinuric treatment by AT1A decreased heparanase expression and restored HS expression. These results suggest involvement of radicals and angiotensin II in the modulation of GBM permeability through HS and heparanase expression.
A previously healthy young man experienced several episodes of syncope while being treated with tenofovir, emtricitabine and nevirapine initiated during primary HIV-1 infection. Symptoms disappeared after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy and we suggest that syncope may be a side effect to one of the three antiretroviral drugs that has not been described previously.
Initial treatment of atrial fibrillation often involves pharmacological therapy to control ventricular response. While verapamil is usually safe and effective when used for this purpose, we report a proarrhythmic response. In this report a 30-year-old female presented with palpitations associated with atrial fibrillation and a ventricular response of 145 beats/min. Soon after she was given 5 mg of intravenous verapamil her ECG documented a regular wide QRS tachycardia at 290 beats/min. After 7 seconds the rhythm returned to an irregularly irregular narrow QRS tachycardia at 125-150 beats/min. At a later electrophysiology study there was neither evidence of preexcitation nor inducible supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia. These data suggest that verapamil may have been associated with acceleration of the heart rate. The mechanism of proarrhythmia may be related to an alteration in the atrial rhythm from atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter, with additional factors as well.
A case of acute immune haemolytic anaemia and renal failure induced by streptomycin, is reported. The clinical features are similar to those in a case previously reported in which no in vitro proof of antibodies was obtained. In this case, streptomycin-specific IgG antibodies, with both k and lambda light chains, could be demonstrated. The streptomycin bound strongly to the red cell membrane, apparently through chemical groups related to the M antigen and possibly also to the D antigen. Complement-fixation by the drug-specific IgG antibodies, after reaction with the streptomycin-coated red cells, could also be demonstrated. On the basis of these findings, our conclusion is that a complement-fixing hapten-cell mechanism was the main cause of the intravascular haemolytic episode suffered by the patient on exposure to streptomycin. This drug had been prescribed 15 years earlier for pulmonary tuberculosis and he had since injected himself with it whenever he felt "flu" symptoms, without harmful effects, until now.
Because the risk of chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity increases with age, the effect of chronic daunorubicin was compared in young (6-9 mo) and senescent (24-26 mo) Fischer 344 rats in cumulative doses of 12 or 18 mg/kg. Senescent rats treated using 18 mg/kg of daunorubicin did not survive because of daunorubicin toxicity. Rats were euthanized 1 wk after the last dose of daunorubicin and ex vivo studies of isometric cardiac contractile function were done in left ventricular trabeculae carneae. In senescent rats given 12 mg/kg of daunorubicin, it caused significant impairment of contractility (dS/dt at 15 cpm; p = 0.001) that was not observed in either young adult group. In addition, the effect of 12 mg/kg of daunorubicin on contractility in senescent rats was significantly reduced compared to that in young rats administered 12 mg/kg of daunorubicin (p < 0.001), although the effect was similar to that in young rats given 18 mg/kg of daunorubicin. In rats receiving 12 mg/kg of daunorubicin, there was an age-dependent effect of daunorubicin on rate-related contractility and on Ca2+-induced contractility. Daunorubicinol, but not daunorubicin, concentrations were increased in the senescent rat heart tissue. This suggests that chronic daunorubicin cardiotoxicity increases with age, at least partly resulting from sarcoplasmic reticulum dysfunction caused by increased anthracycline exposure.
Both all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) have proven to be very effective in obtaining high clinical complete remission (CR) rates in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
In this study, 73 newly diagnosed APL subjects were treated with an ATRA and As(2)O(3) combination treatment in remission induction and post remission therapy. Tumor burden was examined with PCR of the PML-RAR fusion transcripts, and side effects were evaluated by means of clinical examination.
The results showed that ATRA/As(2)O(3) combination therapy yielded a CR rate of 94.5% (69/73) with a shorter time to enter CR (median: 27 days; range: 21-43 days). Four cases failed to enter CR; three of these died of cerebral hemorrhage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) within 72 hours of starting induction therapy, one older patient died of severe pulmonary infection. The early death rate was 5.5% (4/73). All 69 cases that obtained CR remained in good clinical remission after a follow-up of 35-74 months (median: 52 months).The drug toxicity profile with the use of As(2)O(3) showed mainly hepatotoxicity. Liver dysfunction was slight in most cases. There were no severe side effects in long term follow-up.
We conclude that APL patients may benefit from the use of the combination of ATRA and As(2)O(3) in either remission induction or consolidation/maintenance.
Nine delirious patients suffering from lithium intoxication were examined with the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMS) to describe the clinical course of the disorder. Serial serum lithium levels were also obtained. Serum lithium levels fell rapidly, but the cognitive impairment associated with the delirium typically persisted for another week or two. Late-developing but self-limiting neuropsychiatric complications occurred in four patients. The basis of the temporal dissociation of serum lithium levels from the clinical manifestations of lithium intoxication remains uncertain.
Polyuria, thirst and polydipsia due to renal diabetes insipidus (RDI) are common side effects of long-term lithium treatment. In a man aged 56 years, the polyuria could be reduced considerably by diuretics. However, as shown in the case of a 49-year-old man, such treatment carries the risk of acute lithium intoxication due to volume depletion and reduced renal lithium clearance. A reduction in the dose of lithium prior to diuretic treatment is therefore mandatory. Although polyuria and polydipsia are generally mainly a nuisance, the condition may become life-threatening when free access to fluids is impossible. This is demonstrated by the case of a 46-year-old man who was on chronic lithium treatment with probable RDI and who developed fatal severe dehydration and hypernatraemia after traumatic brain injury. Awareness of the possibility of RDI in patients on chronic lithium treatment is therefore important.
Werner syndrome is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in a RecQ-like DNA helicase. Mice lacking the helicase domain of the WRN homologue exhibit many features of Werner syndrome, including a pro-oxidant status and a shorter mean life span. Here, we show that resveratrol supplementation improved the hyperglycemia and the insulin resistance phenotype in these Wrn mutant mice. In addition, resveratrol reversed liver steatosis, lipid peroxidaton, and the defenestration phenotypes observed in such mice. Resveratrol, however, did not improve the hypertriglyceridemia, inflammatory stress, nor extend the mean life span of these mutant mice. Microarray and biologic pathway enrichment analyses on liver tissues revealed that resveratrol mainly decreased lipidogenesis and increased genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway and the glutathione metabolism in Wrn mutant mice. Finally, resveratrol-treated mutant mice exhibited an increase in the frequency of lymphoma and of several solid tumors. These results indicate that resveratrol supplementation might exert at least metabolic benefits for Werner syndrome patients.
Patched (Ptch) heterozygous mice develop medulloblastoma (MB) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) resembling the corresponding human tumors. We have previously shown that epigenetic silencing of the intact Ptch allele contributes to tumor formation in this model. Here, we investigated whether targeting of epigenetic silencing mechanisms could be useful in the treatment of Ptch-associated cancers. A reduction of endogenous DNA methyltransferase1 (Dnmt1) activity significantly reduced tumor incidence in heterozygous Ptch knockout mice. A combined treatment with the Dnmt inhibitor 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and the histone deacetlyase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) efficiently prevented MB and RMS formation, whereas monotherapies with either drug were less effective. Wild-type Ptch expression was efficiently reactivated in tumors by 5-aza-dC/VPA combination therapy. This was associated with reduced methylation of the Ptch promoter and induction of histone hyperacetylation suggesting inhibition of HDACs in vivo. However, the treatment was not effective in clinically overt, advanced stage tumors. This is a first in vivo demonstration that targeting of Dnmt and HDAC activities is highly effective in preventing formation of Ptch-associated tumors. The results suggest a novel clinical strategy for consolidation therapy of corresponding tumors in humans after completion of conventional treatment. Our data also suggest that epigenetic therapy may be less effective in treating advanced stages of tumors, at least in this tumor model.
The frequency and characteristics of the long term sequelae of herpes simplex encephalitis were assessed after treatment with acyclovir.
Patients were included if they were treated with acyclovir and the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis was confirmed by culture of herpes simplex virus (HSV) from the brain, an increase in the CSF HSV antibody titre, or detection of HSV deoxyribonucleic acid in the CSF. Each patient's medical records were reviewed and surviving patients were interviewed and examined.
A diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis was confirmed in 42 patients. Five patients (12%) died in the first month. Three patients (7%) had severe neurological sequelae and died after a longer interval. All but one of the 34 surviving patients had neurological symptoms, an abnormal neurological examination, or both. Twenty patients (48%) performed everyday activities as well as before herpes simplex encephalitis; nine patients (21%) were living independently, but were functioning at a lower level than before the illness; and five patients (12%) had a severe neurological deficit. Twenty nine of the 34 survivors were assessed six months to 11 years after herpes simplex encephalitis. The most common long term symptoms were memory impairment (69%), personality and behavioural abnormalities (45%), and epilepsy (24%). Short term memory impairment (70%), anosmia (65%), and dysphasia (41%) were the most common signs.
Although acyclovir has reduced the mortality of herpes simplex encephalitis, 30% of this group of patients either died or had a severe neurological deficit. The other 70% of the patients regained independence in activities of daily living, but most of these people had persistent neurological symptoms, signs, or both.
Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) induce the clinical and biochemical manifestations of a metabolic syndrome by as yet unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that incubation (1 h) of rat hepatoma Fao cells with the SSRIs paroxetine and sertraline, but not with the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine, inhibited the insulin-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with half-maximal effects at approximately 10 microM. This inhibition correlated with a rapid phosphorylation and activation of a number of Ser/Thr IRS-1 kinases including JNK, S6K1, ERK and p38 MAPK, but not PKB (Akt). JNK appears as a key player activated by SSRIs because specific JNK inhibitors partially eliminated the effects of these drugs. The SSRIs induced the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on S307 and S408, which inhibits IRS-1 function and insulin signaling. These results implicate selected SSRIs as inhibitors of insulin signaling and as potential inducers of cellular insulin resistance.
