The identification of SPG7 as the gene defective in a recessive form of spastic paraplegia has drawn attention to the yeast protein family of ATP-dependent zinc metalloproteases. The protein encoded by SPG7, paraplegin, shows high homology to members of this protein family. Recently, many mammalian ATP-dependent zinc metalloproteases have been identified and considered as possible candidates for defects in other forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders. So far only a partial sequence has been available for one of those genes, ATPase family gene-3, yeast-like-1 (AFG3L1). We have carried out detailed molecular analysis of this gene and identified and characterized its mouse orthologue, Afg3l1. Our data indicate that AFG3L1 is transcribed into four mRNA isoforms that are not translated in humans. Afg3l1 encodes a protein with high homology to paraplegin and the other members of the ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease family. Like the other ATP-dependent zinc metalloproteases, Afg3l1 localizes to the mitochondria.
Within a period of four years 35 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with tamoxifen. One third had objective remissions, average duration of complete remission being 30.6 months and of partial remission 13.7 months. Mean survival time from start of tamoxifen treatment in five patients with complete remission was 30.6 months while in seven with partial remission it was 20.4 months. Nine patients with unresponsive metastases had a mean survival time of 24.3 months, the remaining 14 patients who deteriorated surviving for 11.7 months. Ten of the 12 patients who responded well were over 60 years old. Lymph-node and lung or pleural metastases were significantly reduced by treatment in four of eight and six of 15 cases, respectively. Satisfactory regression of bony metastases was never seen. Because of this, combined tamoxifen (10 mg twice daily) and methandrostenolone (1 mg twice daily) was given to an additional five patients, with one of them responding. Side effects included thrombocytopenia and hypercalcaemia.
The diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is based on the triad of: (1) papilledema, (2) elevated intracranial pressure with a normal cerebrospinal constituency and (3) normal central nervous system imaging studies. It is an uncommon complication of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy in children treated for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Its occurrence is rare among adult patients with APL and treated with ATRA . We report a case of an adult with APL who developed PC during induction therapy with ATRA-PC was managed with repeated lumbar punctures and corticotherapy.
A total of 841 febrile neutropenic patients from 20 centers were randomized to receive carbenicillin (or ticarcillin) plus amikacin or these antibiotics plus cefazolin to compare outcome and incidence of nephrotoxicity. Infection with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus aureus accounted for most of the microbiologically documented febrile episodes. The response to therapy was similar in the two treatment groups for all infections and for bacteremia. Improvement occurred in 35 (64%) of 55 bacteremic patients treated with two antibiotics and 39 (65%) of 60 treated with three antibiotics. An increase in serum creatinine to 2 mg/dL over baseline occurred in eight (2.1%) of 381 patients in the former and in 50 (2.4%) of 364 patients in the latter group. Thus, the two antibiotic regimens were equal in efficacy and in nephrotoxicity. Although not the primary focus of this study, a significant decrease in incidence of infection, including bacteremias, was found in neutropenic patients treated with any oral intestine decontamination regimen.
This study was designed to assess the involvement of D1 dopamine actions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on intravenous cocaine self-administration. Rats were trained to self-administer intravenous injections of cocaine (1.0 mg/kg per injection) on a fixed-ratio 1 (FR-1) schedule or a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement and then were tested under the influence of bilateral VTA injections of the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 or the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin. SCH 23390 increased cocaine self-administration on the FR-1 schedule but decreased it on the PR schedule. Injections of ketanserin were ineffective, as were injections of SCH 23390 in a site 1 mm dorsal or 1 mm rostral to the effective VTA site. These data suggest a role for dendritically released dopamine, presumably acting through D1 receptors located on the axons of GABAergic or glutamatergic inputs to the VTA, in the effectiveness of cocaine reward.
Long-term motor complications of dopamine replacement, such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) and reduced quality of L-DOPA action, remain obstacles in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems have been observed in both the untreated parkinsonian and dyskinetic states and represent novel targets for treatment. Here, we assess the pharmacokinetic profile and corresponding pharmacodynamic effects on behavior of the orally active, selective metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGlu5) antagonist, 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) (as the hydrochloride salt) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned macaque. Six parkinsonian, MPTP-lesioned cynomolgus monkeys, with established LID, were administered acute challenges with MTEP (4.5-36 mg/kg p.o.) or vehicle, either alone or in combination with L-DOPA (33 +/- 1 mg/kg p.o.). Motor activity, parkinsonian disability, and dyskinesia were assessed for a 6-h period. Plasma drug levels were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. MTEP had no antiparkinsonian action as monotherapy. However, administration of L-DOPA in combination with MTEP (36 mg/kg) reduced peak dose LID by 96%. Moreover, although total on-time (duration for which L-DOPA exerted an antiparkinsonian effect) was not significantly reduced, MTEP (36 mg/kg) reduced the duration of on-time with disabling LID by 70% compared with that for L-DOPA alone. These effects were associated with a peak plasma concentration of 20.9 microM and an area under the curve from 0 to 24 h of 136.1 h x microM (36 mg/kg). Although total on-time was not reduced, the peak antiparkinsonian benefit of l-DOPA/MTEP (36 mg/kg) was less than that with L-DOPA alone. Selective mGlu5 inhibitors may have significant potential to ameliorate dyskinesia, but care should be taken to ensure that such effects do not come at the expense of the peak antiparkinsonian benefit of L-DOPA.
Olmesartan is a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist. In pentobarbital-anesthetized open-chest dogs, ischemia/reperfusion was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 20 min and releasing it for 60 min, respectively. The myocardial contraction in the ischemic area decreased and returned towards its pre-ischemic level during reperfusion but incompletely. Olmesartan improved the recovery of myocardial contraction during reperfusion associated with restoration of myocardial ATP. Angiotensin II repelled by AT1 receptors occupied by olmesartan can reach and stimulate the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors, resulting in some beneficial effects on the ischemic myocardium. In fact, AT2 receptor mRNA was found in the adult dog myocardium. In addition, the plasma level of angiotensin II was significantly increased by olmesartan. PD123319, a selective AT2 receptor antagonist, however, did not modify the effect of olmesartan on the cardiac contraction. The hypertensive response to exogenous angiotensin II was completely inhibited by olmesartan, whereas PD123319 did not abolish the effect of olmesartan. In conclusion, olmesartan protects the ischemic/reperfused heart against ischemic injury through inhibition of AT1 receptors but not indirect activation of AT2 receptors.
A prospective, randomized study was performed to compare syrup of ipecac to apomorphine as the emetic of choice in poisoning cases. Of the 28 adults studied, 15 patients (54%) received 30 ml of ipecac orally and 13 received 0.1 mg/kg apomorphine subcutaneously. Emesis was successfully induced with initial therapy in 13 of 15 (87%) ipecac-treated patients and 10 of 13 (77%) apomorphine-treated patients. In the ipecac group the mean latency period before onset of vomiting was 11.6 minutes (range 4 to 26 min) and in the apomorphine group, 5.3 minutes (range 2 to 13 min) (P less than .01). In the ipecac group, one patient suffered moderate central nervous system (CNS) depression. No hypotension or respiratory depression was observed in this group. In the apomorphine group significant CNS depression developed in eight patients (62%), hypotension developed in five (38%) and respiratory depression in one. There was no consistent relationship between type of poison ingested and occurrence of side effects.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an analogue of pyrimidine nucleosides that is widely used in the treatment of head and neck, breast, ovarian, and colon cancer. Stomatitis, diarrhea, dermatitis, and myelosuppression are the main toxicities of 5-FU. A less frequent side effect that is becoming more recognized is neurologic toxicity. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of 5-FU. DPD deficiency follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, and its prevalence is estimated to be 3%. Cancer patients who are receiving 5-FU treatment and are DPD deficient can develop severe side effects. The neurologic toxicity can vary from being mild to severe and prolonged. We describe the side effects of 5-FU in a colon cancer patient who suffered severe mucositis, desquamating dermatitis, prolonged myelosuppression, and neurologic toxicity that required admission to the intensive care unit. The patient remained hospitalized for 3 months. Recovery from the side effects was complete 4 months after the last 5-FU treatment. Subsequent testing revealed that this patient has an extremely low level of DPD activity (0.015 nmol/min/mg protein; mean, 0.189 nmol/min/mg protein). Because neurologic toxicity is becoming more recognized and DPD affects the catabolism of 5-FU, we discuss management issues and the use of new DPD inhibitors. We also discuss whether screening for DPD deficiency is warranted to identify patients at risk for severe toxicities from 5-FU treatment.
Between 1975 and 1988, 92 pediatric patients have undergone bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at our institution for malignant or immune deficiency disease. We evaluated in a retrospective fashion 64 of these patients who survived beyond the first 60 days post-BMT. The clinical course was divided into: less than 60 days post-BMT (early) and greater than 60 days post-BMT (late). The presence or absence of renal insufficiency was noted as well as all known potential factors predisposing to insufficiency. Step-wise regression analysis was then performed to determine which of the factors were most significantly associated with renal dysfunction during the two periods. The follow-up period was 2 months to 11 years (mean 17.5 months). The mean age of the patients was 7.6 years (1 month-18 years). Fifty percent of the patients had renal insufficiency during the early period and 28% of the patients had insufficiency after the initial 60 days. Three major predictors of renal insufficiency were discovered. Cyclosporin A or amphotericin B early or late post-BMT was independently predictive of developing insufficiency during the same period. Conditioning with total body irradiation was a predictor for insufficiency in both periods. Early insufficiency was not predictive of late insufficiency. Hypertension was present in 31% of patients during the early period and in 16% during the late period. Hypertension was strongly associated with cyclosporin use and renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency is a frequent sequela in children following BMT and likely results from a combination of radiation injury and drug toxicity.
Three cases of D-penicillamine (DPA) induced myasthenia gravis (MG) and one case of DPA-induced polymyositis (PM) are reported among four patients suffering from seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. The cumulative doses responsible for the three DPA-induced MG cases amounted respectively to 73, 117 and 467 g. The cumulative dose responsible for the DPA-induced PM case amounted to 465 g. All the patients were HLA DR1. All four cases healed completely after withdrawal of DPA. The aetiology of the cases is discussed and the literature is reviewed. These cases represent further instances of DPA-induced neuromuscular disorders.
Three cases of busulfan-associated convulsions in 28 bone marrow transplant recipients are reported. Convulsions occurred in spite of anticonvulsant prophylaxis in two of the three cases. Fits were generalized; no neurological deficit was found after the episodes and there were no recurrences. Although conditioning regimens including busulfan are used increasingly only rare cases have been reported and little mention of this side effect is made. We emphasize that convulsions are not infrequent side effect of conditioning regimens including high dose busulfan, and efficient anticonvulsant prophylactic regimens should be used.
The intraperitoneal administration of cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg, 48 h before cystometry) induced detrusor hyperreflexia in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Intrathecal administration of the selective tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, GR 82,334 ([D-Pro9(spiro-gamma-lactam)Leu10,Trp11]physalaemin-(1-11)) (1 nmol/rat i.t.) had no significant effect on micturition in normal rats but increased the volume threshold In cyclophosphamide-treated rats. Another tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, RP 67,580 ((3aR,7aR)-7,7-diphenyl-2-[1-imino-2(2-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]+ ++perhydroisoindol -4-one) (10 nmol/rat i.t.) increased the volume threshold to a similar extent in both vehicle- and cyclophosphamide-treated animals. The tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist, SR 48,968 (S7-N-methyl-N[4-(acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3,4- dichlorophenyl)butyl]benzamide hydrochloride (10 nmol/rat i.t.) did not modify micturition parameters in normal rats but antagonized bladder hyperreflexia in cyclophosphamide-treated animals; SR 48,968 restored the volume threshold for the micturition reflex to values close to control values. SR 48,965 (R7-N-methyl-N[4-(acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3,4- dichlorophenyl)butyl]benzamide hydrochloride) (10 nmol/rat i.t.), the enantiomer of SR 48,968 devoid of affinity for tachykinin NK2 receptors, was inactive. 2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (25 and 250 nmol/rat i.t.), a selective antagonist of NMDA receptors, augmented the volume threshold both in controls and in rats with detrusor hyperreflexia; after administration of this antagonist, however, the volume threshold in cyclophosphamide-treated animals was still lower than in controls. Intravenous administration of SR 48,968, RP 67,580, or the combined administration of SR 48,968 and RP 67,580 had no effect on cystometry variables either in rats with detrusor hyperreflexia or in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Myocardial inflammation andfibrosis are common autopsyfindings in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and, although symptomatic cardiac involvement occurs less often, current therapies remain empiric and do not prevent or modify its course. In this open, uncontrolled study we assessed the short-term effects of glucocorticoid administration on myocardial performance in patients with SSc in the absence of clinically overt cardiac disease.
Resting radionuclide ventriculography with 99mTc was performed before and 20 days after the administration of prednisolone, 20 mg daily, in 32 patients with SSc without clinically evident myocardial dysfunction at rest; 13 and 19 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), respectively, were studied in parallel as controls.
The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) value at baseline was 59% in the SSc group; similar values were found for the SLE (61%) and RA (59%) groups. An impaired LVEF (i.e., <50%) was found in 6 patients with SSc and in 1 patient with SLE. Prednisolone administration resulted in a significant percent improvement in the baseline LVEF (mean 18%, p = 0.0001) in the SSc group; this improvement was greater in the patients with diffuse SSc than in those with limited skin disease (27% vs 10%, p = 0.02). The improvement was most prominent in the 6 patients with an initial impaired LVEF No significant improvement was observed in the SLE or RA control groups. The linear trend betveen the individual baseline LVEF values in patients with SSc and their percent changes after treatment (r2 = 0.55, p: 0.00001) showed that the lower the initial LVEF the greater the improvement caused by prednisolone. The degree of LVEF improvement was also associated with the individual erythrocvte sedimentation rate values and serum IgG concentrations at baseline. Prednisolone-induced changes in LVEF were not associated with any changes in blood pressure, heart rate, blood, plasma, or red cell volumes.
Glucocorticoid administration may improve myocardial performance in some patients with SSc. Although further double-blind controlled studies of the long-term effects are warranted, such treatment may be useful in those patients with SSc and documented low LVEF if they are kept under careful observation for objective improvement.
The effects of the selective histamine H3 receptor agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine and antagonist thioperamide on stimulant-induced locomotor activity in the mouse were examined. Amphetamine (1 mg.kg-1 s.c.), apomorphine (2 mg.kg-1 s.c.) or cocaine (5 mg.kg-1 s.c.) increased locomotor activity. Neither thioperamide (10 mg.kg-1 i.p.) nor (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (20 mg.kg-1 i.p.) affected spontaneous locomotor activity in their own right. (R)-alpha-Methylhistamine (0.3, 3 or 20 mg.kg-1 i.p.) also had no effect on amphetamine (1 mg.kg-1 s.c.)-induced locomotor activity. In contrast, thioperamide (0.2-10 mg.kg-1 i.p. or 0.3-20 micrograms i.c.v.) inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the hyperactivity response induced by amphetamine (1 mg.kg-1 s.c.). (R)-alpha-Methylhistamine (20 mg.kg-1 i.p.) completely reversed the inhibitory response to thioperamide (2 mg.kg-1 i.p.). Thioperamide (2 or 10 mg.kg-1 i.p.) also inhibited apomorphine (2 mg.kg-1 s.c.)- and, to a lesser extent, cocaine (5 mg.kg-1 s.c.)-induced hyperactivity. We therefore conclude that antagonism of the central histamine H3 receptor inhibits, to a varying degree, the effects of locomotor stimulants.
In various kinds of hypertension clonidine induced a decrease in urinary catecholamines, plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone, concommitant with a fall in blood pressure and pulse rate in both short term and chronic studies. Furthermore, clonidine lowered the plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline but a postural increase in upright position still occurred. The capacity to increase renin during salt restriction seemed mainatined. When clonidine was withdrawn all parameters returned to pretreatment levels but in some cases a marked rebound increase in catecholamine production was seen. --During clonidine the increase in catecholamines and renin after insulin induced hypoglycemia was largely abolished. Under basal conditions oral penbutolol induced a decrease of pule rate and blood pressure but no change in plasma or urinary catecholamines. During treatment plasma renin was suppressed at rest and after exercise. A work load, which led to only minor changes in blood catecholamines before treatment, was associated with a marked increase during penbutolol. Medication with penbutolol reduced the response in plasma catecholamines after hypoglycemia and renin activity remained low. Clonidine seems to act mainly by central inhibtion of symapthetic tone. Penbutolol probably acts mainly peripherally but may also have a central effect.
A 32-year-old, very slightly overweight woman (body mass index of 25) without any cardiovascular risk factors presented with acute chest pain. She reported taking the appetite suppressant sibutramine daily for three months. She was not pregnant and did not remember episodes of serious mental stress or infection during the last few weeks. Physical examination was unsuspicious.
Laboratory results revealed an elevation of serum markers of myocardial ischemia. The electrocardiogram showed ST segment depressions and T wave inversions in leads II, III and aVF, indicating a nontransmural inferior myocardial infarction.
Coronary angiography showed patent coronary arteries with inferior wall hypokinesia. There were no signs of a coronary dissection. Assuming that the acute coronary syndrome had been induced by coronary spasms, the patient was treated with amlodipine and ramipril.
It seemed reasonable to suspect that the intake of sibutramine had induced coronary spasms. However, this is a diagnosis of exclusion. Three case reports have previously been published about acute myocardial infarctions, possibly related to sibutramin intake, in young patients with a negligible cardiovascular risk profile. The European Medicines Agency has questioned the marketing authorisations for sibutramine (January 2010). In patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes which can not be clearly related to cardiovascular risk factors, it is crucial to obtain a complete drug history. Some patients might continue to take sibutramine.
Thirty patients undergoing epirubicin therapy for primary lung cancer were studied by echocardiography and Doppler echocardiography. 2 D ejection fraction (EF) and Doppler left ventricular filling parameters (peak E, peak A, E/A ratio) were calculated before and after the completion of therapy. No differences in the mean values of these parameters were observed. However, 6 out of 30 patients (20%) showed left ventricular filling abnormalities; in 2 of them a slight reduction of EF was also noted. These abnormalities seem to be dose related. A longer term prospective study will be required to evaluate whether these findings are irreversible and to establish the clinical implications of our observations.
Chronic synovitis affects about 10% of patients with severe haemophilia in India. This disease has some features in common with ankylosing spondylitis, which has been linked to HLA B27. We therefore aimed to test whether there is an association between HLA B27 and chronic synovitis. We studied 473 patients with severe haemophilia (33 of whom had chronic synovitis), and 1175 healthy controls using a standard serological technique and the reverse line strip assay. 64% (21 of 33) of patients with haemophilia and chronic synovitis were positive for HLA B27, compared with 5% (23 of 440) of those with severe haemophilia, but not chronic synovitis (odds ratio 31.6 [95% CI 9.28-39.38], p<0.0001), and 9% (100 of 1175) of healthy controls (18.81 [9.6-27.7], p<0.0001). We conclude that there is a strong association between HLA B27 and chronic synovitis in Indian patients with severe haemophilia and screening in this population could allow treatment and prevention of the complication.
A quantitative autoradiographic technique that utilizes carbon-14-aminoisobutyric acid (14C-AIB) as a tracer was used to study alterations in cerebral microvascular permeability in 15 rats. Five were "sham-operated" controls and 10 underwent microsurgical, unilateral occlusion of the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA). Histological changes indicative of focal cerebral ischemia were observed in only the latter 10 animals. These changes were confined to tissue normally perfused by the occluded MCA. After MCA occlusion, five animals were also subjected to transient halothane-induced hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure 50 mm Hg) for 20 to 30 minutes. Only in these five animals were blood-to-brain transfer constants (ki) significantly increased (by approximately 100%) at 4 hours after MCA occlusion. The topographical distribution of this alteration in cerebral microvascular permeability corresponded closely with the histological changes. Neither proximal MCA occlusion nor halothane-induced hypotension alone was associated with any focal or diffuse increase in ki after 4 hours.
Although empirical regimens of parenteral chloroquine have been used extensively to treat severe malaria for 40 years, recent recommendations state that parenteral chloroquine should no longer be used because of potential toxicity. We studied prospectively the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of seven chloroquine regimens in 58 Gambian children with severe chloroquine-sensitive falciparum malaria. In all regimens the total cumulative dose was 25 mg of chloroquine base per kilogram of body weight. Chloroquine was rapidly absorbed after either intramuscular or subcutaneous administration (5 mg of base per kilogram every 12 hours), producing high peak blood concentrations but transient hypotension in 5 of 18 patients (28 percent). Intermittent intravenous infusion (5 mg of base per kilogram over 4 hours, repeated every 12 hours) also produced wide fluctuations in chloroquine levels, suggesting incomplete distribution from a small central compartment. Continuous infusion (0.83 mg of base per kilogram per hour for 30 hours) and smaller, more frequent intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of chloroquine (3.5 mg of base per kilogram every 6 hours) produced smoother blood-concentration profiles with lower early peak levels and no adverse cardiovascular or neurologic effects. Chloroquine given by nasogastric tube (initial dose, 10 mg of base per kilogram) was absorbed well, even in comatose children. We conclude that simple alterations in dosage and frequency of administration can give parenteral chloroquine an acceptable therapeutic ratio and reinstate it as the treatment of choice for severe malaria in areas where chloroquine resistance is not a major problem.
Aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or at high risk for cardiovascular disease. However, many individuals suffer a stroke or other cardiovascular event despite aspirin therapy. Data suggest that heritability contributes importantly to the antiplatelet and clinical responses to aspirin. Candidate genes for influencing aspirin response include those involved in platelet aggregation and in modulating cardiovascular disease risk and progression. Although several studies have examined genetic determinants of platelet responsiveness to aspirin, the results are largely inconsistent. Few studies have examined genetic association with clinical outcomes, including reductions in stroke risk, with aspirin. In perhaps the most significant pharmacogenomic study with aspirin to date, a large primary prevention trial showed that the apolipoprotein A genotype was associated with risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events in women and that aspirin eliminated this risk. These data suggest that ultimately, it may be possible to tailor aspirin therapy based on an individual's genotype, at least for primary prevention of stroke and cardiovascular events in women. Data on genetic determinants of response to aspirin in secondary stroke prevention are far less advanced. Future pharmacogenomic studies should focus on elucidating the role of genotyping in choosing appropriate antiplatelet therapy (ie, aspirin alone versus a thienopyridine or combination antiplatelet therapy) for secondary disease prevention.
Breast cancer has recently been linked to cadmium exposure. Although not uniformly supported, it is hypothesized that cadmium acts as a metalloestrogenic carcinogen via the estrogen receptor (ER). Thus, we studied the effects of chronic exposure to cadmium on the normal human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A, which is ER-negative but can convert to ER-positive during malignant transformation.
Cells were continuously exposed to low-level cadmium (2.5 muM) and checked in vitro and by xenograft study for signs of malignant transformation. Transformant cells were molecularly characterized by protein and transcript analysis of key genes in breast cancer.
Over 40 weeks of cadmium exposure, cells showed increasing secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9, loss of contact inhibition, increased colony formation, and increasing invasion, all typical for cancer cells. Inoculation of cadmium-treated cells into mice produced invasive, metastatic anaplastic carcinoma with myoepithelial components. These cadmium-transformed breast epithelial (CTBE) cells displayed characteristics of basal-like breast carcinoma, including ER-alpha negativity and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) negativity, reduced expression of BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1), and increased CK5 (cytokeratin 5) and p63 expression. CK5 and p63, both breast stem cell markers, were prominently overexpressed in CTBE cell mounds, indicative of persistent proliferation. CTBE cells showed global DNA hypomethylation and c-myc and k-ras overexpression, typical in aggressive breast cancers. CTBE cell xenograft tumors were also ER-alpha negative.
Cadmium malignantly transforms normal human breast epithelial cells-through a mechanism not requiring ER-alpha-into a basal-like cancer phenotype. Direct cadmium induction of a malignant phenotype in human breast epithelial cells strongly fortifies a potential role in breast cancer.
The aim of this study was to present the clinical characteristics of and the evaluation methods for the motor complications sometimes observed in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, differentiating motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The most common forms of motor fluctuations are the predictable end-of-dose deterioration (wearing off), the early-morning akinesia, and the on-off phenomenon. Non-motor fluctuations are often associated with different symptoms: dysautonomia, pain, psychic or cognitive signs during off periods and sometimes also during on periods. Levodopa-induced dyskinesias are classified according to their temporal profile after drug administration, namely peak-dose dyskinesias (mainly choreic movements), biphasic dyskinesias--onset and end-of-dose--(mainly dystonic and ballic movements), and finally off-period dyskinesias (dystonic movements). Clinical evaluation of motor complications must be performed precisely to establish the best therapeutic strategy.
The effects of different regimens of 40 mg aspirin on platelet thromboxane A2 synthesis and vascular prostacyclin synthesis were determined in patients who were undergoing elective surgery for removal of varicose veins. Aspirin 40 mg taken at intervals of 48 hours consistently reduced platelet thromboxane A2 synthesis to a level at which it failed to support platelet aggregation and the associated release reaction. This effect lasted for at least 36 hours. In contrast, aspirin 40 mg every 72 hours did not have the same consistent effect. Both dose regimens led to a reduction in vascular prostacyclin synthesis 12 hours after the last dose, but 36 or 72 hours after the last dose prostacyclin synthesis was not reduced; thus the inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis was short lived. If the balance between platelet thromboxane A2 and vascular prostacyclin synthesis is important in thrombosis 40 mg aspirin every 48 hours may have the maximum antithrombotic effect.
By disrupting the action of androgens during gestation, certain chemicals present in food, consumer products, and the environment can induce irreversible demasculinization and malformations of sex organs among male offspring. However, the consequences of simultaneous exposure to such chemicals are not well described, especially when they exert their actions by differing molecular mechanisms.
To fill this gap, we investigated the effects of mixtures of a widely used plasticizer, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP); two fungicides present in food, vinclozolin and prochloraz; and a pharmaceutical, finasteride, on landmarks of male sexual development in the rat, including changes in anogenital distance (AGD), retained nipples, sex organ weights, and malformations of genitalia. These chemicals were chosen because they disrupt androgen action with differing mechanisms of action.
Strikingly, the effect of combined exposure to the selected chemicals on malformations of external sex organs was synergistic, and the observed responses were greater than would be predicted from the toxicities of the individual chemicals. In relation to other hallmarks of disrupted male sexual development, including changes in AGD, retained nipples, and sex organ weights, the combined effects were dose additive. When the four chemicals were combined at doses equal to no observed adverse effect levels estimated for nipple retention, significant reductions in AGD were observed in male offspring.
Because unhindered androgen action is essential for human male development in fetal life, these findings are highly relevant to human risk assessment. Evaluations that ignore the possibility of combination effects may lead to considerable underestimations of risks associated with exposures to chemicals that disrupt male sexual differentiation.
