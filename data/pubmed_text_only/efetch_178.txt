A boy with delayed psychomotor development, attention deficit disorder, and therapy-resistant epilepsy was treated with valproate. The patient died of liver failure after 4 months of valproate treatment. Postmortem investigation of cultured fibroblasts suggested medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, an unexpected finding since the boy had not presented typical manifestations of this disease. Because medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is an important enzyme in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, our patient probably had a genetically reduced tolerance to valproate. This drug should be omitted in the treatment of seizures in patients with possible medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.
To compare the safety and efficacy of the ocular hypotensive lipid AGN 192024 (Lumigan) with those of timolol.
A 30-day, randomized, investigator-masked, clinical trial involving 100 patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Study medications were instilled topically. Doses of 0.003%, 0.01%, or 0.03% AGN 192024 were given once daily for 3 weeks then twice daily for 1 week, and vehicle control or 0.5% timolol was given twice daily for 4 weeks. Mean change in IOP from baseline was the primary efficacy variable. Safety parameters included adverse events, hyperemia grading, laser flare meter analysis, heart rate, and blood pressure.
Timolol and all 3 concentrations of AGN 192024 lowered IOP from baseline (P < .001). A dosage of 0.03% AGN 192024 once daily lowered IOP significantly more than timolol (P < or = .02) at every study visit except day 21 (P = .053) and provided better diurnal IOP control. Twice-daily dosing of AGN 192024 provided no clinically significant benefit over once-daily dosing. All treatment regimens were safe and well tolerated, with no clinically significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure and no between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events. The only significant ocular safety finding with AGN 192024 was a dose-related mild increase in conjunctival hyperemia.
Of the 3 concentrations tested, 0.03% AGN 192024 once daily had the best therapeutic profile. AGN 192024 was safe and well tolerated, and it provided superior ocular hypotensive efficacy and diurnal IOP control compared with timolol in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma.
1. Plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were measured in rats following exposure to anaesthetic agents, after stimulation of peripheral sensory nerves, and during psychological stress. 2. In rats, kept in their home cages, the i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbitone did not cause an increase in plasma ACTH, whereas injection of urethane increased plasma ACTH several times. In rats transferred to a glass dessicator and inhaling oxygen, plasma ACTH was more than 3 fold higher than in rats in their home cage. Exposure to nitrous oxide, halothane or ether in a glass dessicator produced significantly higher plasma ACTH concentrations when compared to exposure in the home cage. 3. In rats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, the electrical stimulation of large myelinated afferents in the sciatic nerve did not trigger a measurable increase in ACTH secretion, whereas stimulation of afferent A delta- and C-fibres significantly elevated plasma ACTH concentrations. Rats treated as neonates with capsaicin showed an attenuated ACTH response to A and C-fibre stimulation. 4. Similarly, capsaicin pretreatment reduced the increase in ACTH secretion during morphine withdrawal; a similar effect was produced by clonidine. 5. ACTH secretion following open field exposure, ether stress or hypoglycaemia was not changed by capsaicin pretreatment. 6. It was concluded that capsaicin-sensitive afferents are involved in the secretion of ACTH elicited by somatosensory forms of stress. Centrally evoked ACTH release is not affected by capsaicin pretreatment.
Exposure to carcinogens through diet, the atmosphere and other means is generally regarded as influencing human cancer risk, but the impact of specific environmental carcinogens on human breast cancer incidence is still unknown. We examined whether distinct chemical carcinogens induce a unique transcriptional profile in mammary gland cancer that is characteristic of the etiologic agent. Rat mammary gland cancers (n = 34) were generated by various carcinogens, including the food-derived heterocyclic amines 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, N-nitrosomethylurea and 4-aminobiphenyl. The histopathology of the carcinomas was graded using a modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson scheme and the gene expression profiles in the carcinomas were evaluated on a 10K cDNA microarray. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two major clusters of carcinomas irrespective of the carcinogenic agent that distinguished two groups with different histopathological parameters (degree of differentiation, nuclear grade, mitotic activity, epithelial cell growth pattern and necrosis). Using class comparison analysis and hierarchical clustering of all carcinomas irrespective of histopathology, gene expression profiles were further shown to be statistically differentially expressed according to the carcinogenic agent. These findings indicate that the transcriptional program in carcinomas is unique to the etiologic agent and can be observed among a diverse set of carcinogens despite variations in carcinoma histopathology. The ability to use microarray analysis to discern an etiology-specific profile among a pathologically heterogeneous group of breast carcinomas may ultimately be valuable in determining the role of environmental chemical carcinogens in human breast cancer risk.
Opioid treatment of chronic rheumatic disease pain is controversial because of concerns regarding efficacy, toxicity, tolerance, dependence, and abuse. This study examined opioid use in a cohort of patients with pain due to defined rheumatic diseases.
Opioid use was studied retrospectively in a cohort of 644 rheumatology clinic patients. Computerized pharmacy records identified patients who had been prescribed opioids during the previous 3 years. Medical records were reviewed to determine reasons for opioid dosage escalations. Patients were interviewed to determine efficacy, frequency and types of side effects, and history of alcohol or street-drug abuse.
Opioid prescriptions were found in the 3-year pharmacy database for 290 of 644 clinic patients: 153 for <3 consecutive months and 137 for > or =3 months. All opioid-treated patients received codeine and/or oxycodone. In this cohort, 133 patients in each opioid-treated group and 76 of the 354 non-opioid-treated control patients were studied. Opioids significantly reduced rheumatic disease pain severity scores from 8.2 to 3.6 (on a 0-10 scale) (P < 0.001). Mild side effects were reported in 38%; nausea, dyspepsia, constipation, and sedation were the most common. The mean +/-SD initial dosage was 2.1+/-1.7 30-mg codeine equivalents/day, the mean peak was 3.4+/-3.3 per day, and the mean current dose was 2.7+/-2.0 per day. Dosage escalations occurred in 32 patients and were attributable to worsening of the underlying painful condition or a medical complication thereof in all but 4 patients, who also displayed other abuse behaviors. Abuse behaviors were not more frequent in those with or without a history of abuse/ addiction.
Prolonged treatment of rheumatic disease pain with codeine or oxycodone was effective in reducing pain severity and was associated with only mild toxicity. Doses were stable for prolonged periods of time, with escalations of the opioid dose almost always related to worsening of the painful condition or a complication thereof, rather than the development of tolerance to opioids. Doubts or concerns about opioid efficacy, toxicity, tolerance, and abuse or addiction should no longer be used to justify withholding opioids from patients with well-defined rheumatic disease pain.
Urinary retention, overflow incontinence, and subsequent detrusor atony were observed following surgery in which a morphine with bupivacaine epidural injection was used for perioperative analgesia. The premise that the urinary retention may have been due to the effects of the morphine component of the epidural is discussed, along with other possible causes.
In the present report 15day-old Wistar rats were injected with 0.3μmol of diphenyl ditelluride (PhTe)(2)/kg body weight and parameters of neurodegeneration were analyzed in slices from striatum 6days afterwards. We found hyperphosphorylation of intermediate filament (IF) proteins from astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein-GFAP and vimentin) and from neuron (low-, medium- and high molecular weight neurofilament subunits: NF-L, NF-M and NF-H, respectively) and increased MAPK (Erk, JNK and p38MAPK) as well as PKA activities. The treatment induced reactive astrogliosis in the striatum, evidenced by increased GFAP and vimentin immunocontent as well as their mRNA overexpression. Also, (PhTe)(2) significantly increased the propidium iodide (PI) positive cells in NeuN positive population without altering PI incorporation into GFAP positive cells, indicating that in vivo exposure to (PhTe)(2) provoked neuronal damage. Immunohistochemistry showed a dramatic increase of GFAP staining characteristic of reactive astrogliosis. Moreover, increased caspase 3 in (PhTe)(2) treated striatal slices suggested apoptotic cell death. (PhTe)(2) exposure decreased Akt immunoreactivity, however phospho-GSK-3-β (Ser9) was unaltered, suggesting that this kinase is not directly implicated in the neurotoxicity of this compound. Therefore, the present results shed light into the mechanisms of (PhTe)(2)-induced neurodegeneration in rat striatum, evidencing a critical role for the MAPK and Akt signaling pathways and disruption of cytoskeletal homeostasis, which could be related with apoptotic neuronal death and astrogliosis.
One of the major adverse effects of vancomycin (VAN) is nephrotoxicity, which the mechanism is not fully understood. However, there is some evidence that oxidative injury could be involved in its pathogenesis. In this study, we examined two antioxidants 4-hydroxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (tempol) a superoxide dismutase mimetic and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) an iron chelator in VAN-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. DHB at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg and tempol at doses of 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg were administered subcutaneously to rats 30 min prior to intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg VAN. Drug administrations were done every 12 h for 7 days. In animals which received only VAN, the activity of urinary gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) decreased and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in urine increased significantly compared to controls. Serum urea and creatinine (Cr) concentrations and the weight of animals' kidneys increased and body weights were decreased significantly in this group compared to controls. DHB at both doses normalized the GGT activity, but only at the higher dose restore the LDH activity. Both doses of DHB ameliorated the rise in serum urea and Cr concentrations and improved the changes in kidney and body weights significantly. Tempol did not show any beneficial effects at all. There were marked pathologic changes in tubules of kidneys of VAN treated animals. The tissue injury was prevented by both doses of DHB and there was almost no sign of tubular injury in 100 mg/kg treated group. Tempol in any doses could not prevent the tissue injury and there were significant differences in tissue injury in all tempol treated rats with controls. It seems that VAN-induced nephrotoxicity is at least partly due to free radical formation. Hydroxyl radicals might play a major role in VAN-induced nephrotoxicity, since an iron chelator (DHB) could reverse the adverse effects. However, production of other radicals such as superoxide is also probable.
The possibility that enalapril might damage renal function was investigated in 1098 deaths recorded in a prescription-event monitoring study. Case notes for 913 patients were examined. In seventy five there was a rise in the urea or creatinine concentration of 50% or more above pretreatment values. Enalapril appeared to have contributed to a decline in renal function and subsequent death in 10 of these patients. Several characteristics were identified among these patients, including old age, the use of high dose or potassium sparing diuretics, and pre-existing renal disease. Adding a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was also associated with a deterioration in patients with previously stable renal function. No death was encountered of a patient with uncomplicated hypertension. Enalapril infrequently contributed to a substantial decline in renal function in certain vulnerable patients, especially those receiving other drugs known to be capable of adversely affecting renal function. Awareness of the characteristics of these patients and of their concomitant treatment may serve to reduce the risk.
To identify and measure the incidence of adverse effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril 13,713 patients were studied for one year by prescription-event monitoring. Precise information about the duration of treatment was available for 12,543 patients. The frequency of many events was calculated, including dizziness (483 patients; 3.9%), persistent dry cough (360; 2.9%), headache (310; 2.5%) hypotension (218; 1.7%), and syncope (155; 1.2%). Less common reactions included angioedema, urticaria, and muscle cramps. Altogether 1098 (8%) patients died and the notes of 913 of them (83%) were obtained for detailed scrutiny. With the exception of a few patients with renal failure who deteriorated during treatment (reported on separately), no death was attributed to enalapril. Enalapril was considered to be effective, even in patients with advanced cardiac failure. These results for enalapril are reassuring and provide further evidence of the value of prescription-event monitoring.
Fundamental processes influencing human growth can be revealed by studying extreme short stature. Using genetic linkage analysis, we find that biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the centrosomal pericentrin (PCNT) gene on chromosome 21q22.3 cause microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II) in 25 patients. Adults with this rare inherited condition have an average height of 100 centimeters and a brain size comparable to that of a 3-month-old baby, but are of near-normal intelligence. Absence of PCNT results in disorganized mitotic spindles and missegregation of chromosomes. Mutations in related genes are known to cause primary microcephaly (MCPH1, CDK5RAP2, ASPM, and CENPJ).
Perinatal di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure was examined in time-mated Wistar rats gavaged from gestation day 7 to postnatal day 16 with doses from 3 to 900 mg/kg-d. These doses covered the whole dose-response curve for the demasculinizing effects of DEHP including low-dose effects. At a relatively low dose of 10 mg/kg-d, DEHP caused adverse anti-androgenic effects on male rat development as male anogenital distance was decreased, the incidence of nipple retention was increased, weight of levator ani/bulbocavernosus muscles and prostate was reduced and mild external genitalia dysgenesis was observed. Higher doses of DEHP induced histopathological effects on the testes, reduced testis weight, and expression of androgen-regulated genes in the prostate. The results provide new evidence of low-dose effects of DEHP and are consistent with the EU NOAEL of 5 mg/kg for DEHP. Our results also indicate a reason for concern about human exposure to DEHP.
Osteopontin (OPN) is an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)- containing glycoprotein encoded by the gene secreted phosphoprotein 1 (spp1). spp1 is expressed during embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumorigenesis; however, its in vivo functions are not well understood. Therefore, OPN null mutant mice were generated by targeted mutagenesis in embryonic stem cells. In OPN mutant mice, embryogenesis occurred normally, and mice were fertile. Since OPN shares receptors with vitronectin (VN), we tested for compensation by creating mice lacking both OPN and VN. The double mutants were also viable, suggesting that other RGD-containing ligands replace the embryonic loss of both proteins. We tested the healing of OPN mutants after skin incisions, where spp1 was upregulated as early as 6 h after wounding. Although the tensile properties of the wounds were unchanged, ultrastructural analysis showed a significantly decreased level of debridement, greater disorganization of matrix, and an alteration of collagen fibrillogenesis leading to small diameter collagen fibrils in the OPN mutant mice. These data indicate a role for OPN in tissue remodeling in vivo, and suggest physiological functions during matrix reorganization after injury.
A 45-year-old woman with prosthetic valves replacement, was admitted with severe headache and vomiting one month after starting danazol treatment at 300 mg per day. She was receiving long-term anticoagulation with warfarin and dipyridamole, taking 3.5 mg and 300 mg per day respectively. The patient's thrombotest value was less than 6% at the time of admission. Cranial CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Warfarin and danazol treatment ware discontinued with replenishment of vitamin K. Recovery was uneventful. Danazol is 2, 3 isoxazol derivative of 17-alpha-ethinyl testosterone. As such, it shares the property of C 17 alkylated steroids in potentiating the action of coumarin. It is suggested that danazol affects the turnover of vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors, an impairment of synthesis being a likely mechanism. The possible hazard of the potentiating effect of danazol on warfarin should be widely appreciated.
Given that prolonged exposure to estrogen and increased telomerase activity are associated with endometrial carcinogenesis, our objective was to evaluate the interaction between the MAPK pathway and estrogen induction of telomerase activity in endometrial cancer cells. Estradiol (E2) induced telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA expression in the estrogen receptor (ER)-α positive, Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell line. UO126, a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, inhibited telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA expression induced by E2. Similar results were also found after transfection with ERK 1/2-specific siRNA. Treatment with E2 resulted in rapid phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and increased MAPK activity which was abolished by UO126. The hTERT promoter contains two estrogen response elements (EREs), and luciferase assays demonstrate that these EREs are activated by E2. Exposure to UO126 or ERK 1/2-specific siRNA in combination with E2 counteracted the stimulatory effect of E2 on luciferase activity from these EREs. These findings suggest that E2-induction of telomerase activity is mediated via the MAPK pathway in human endometrial cancer cells.
Studies of acute cocaine cardiotoxicity are often confounded by the effects of cocaine on peripheral hemodynamics and an intact sympathetic nervous system. To study the direct effects of an acute dose of cocaine on heart, we used Langendorff-perfused isolated rabbit hearts. The hearts were attached to a Langendorff perfusion system through the aorta and were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. In nonpaced hearts, cocaine in concentrations of 10, 25, and 50 microM (reported to be in the range of drug concentrations lethal for humans) caused dose-dependent deterioration in heart contractility (decrease in +dP/dt, -dP/dt, and developed pressure) and coronary flow, when measured at 10, 20, and 30 min of the protocol. Cocaine 25 and 50 microM also caused a decrease in heart rate (HR). In paced hearts treated with cocaine 50 microM, early events included a progressive decrease in +dP/dt (by 15% vs. baseline at 20 s of perfusion and by 26% vs. baseline and 19% vs. control group at 30 s of perfusion; p < 0.05) and in -dP/dt (by 20% vs. baseline at 30 s of perfusion and by 25% vs. baseline and 15% vs. control group at 40 s of perfusion, p < 0.05). Decrease in HR (failure to pace) was observed only at 60 s of perfusion and averaged 20% versus both baseline and control group (p < 0.05). No changes in coronary flow were observed during the first 60 s after onset of cocaine administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Diabetic nephropathy management should include the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker with additional antihypertensive medications to reduce proteinuria and cardiovascular events. Some studies suggest that adding a nondihydropyridine rather than a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) may more effectively lower proteinuria. We hypothesized that a trandolapril/verapamil SR (T/V) fixed-dose combination (FDC) was superior to a benazepril/amlodipine (B/A) FDC for reducing albuminuria in 304 hypertensive diabetic nephropathy patients when treated for 36 weeks. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups in the primary end point; adjusted percentage change in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), which increased (mean T/V, 29.29%; mean B/A, 8.49%; difference, 20.80%; P=.34); or in change in absolute UACR, which decreased (mean [g/g] T/V, -0.11; mean [g/g] B/A, -0.08; difference -0.03; P=.78). There were significant reductions in log UACR (mean change in T/V, -0.28; P<.01; mean change in B/A, -0.31; P<.001) and diastolic blood pressure in both groups and in systolic blood pressure in the B/A group. T/V was not superior to B/A for reducing UACR. Both ACEI/CCB FDCs may reduce albuminuria; in the case of T/V, this appears to be independent of systolic blood pressure reduction in patients who had previously been treated and had baseline blood pressure levels of 142/77 mm Hg.
Netobimin (NTB) is a prodrug of albendazole (ABZ) and is used as a broad-spectrum anthelmintic both in human and veterinary medicine. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated po with 50, 59.5 and 70.7 mg/kg of NTB on Gestational Day (GD) 10. The results, observed on GD 20, demonstrated that NTB induced a significant increase of resorptions. Moreover, decreased fetal body weight and an increase in skeletal malformations were observed in treated groups. We report the first study in which vascular malformations are described in rats after the administration of a benzimidazole compound. An interesting relationship between intercostal vessel and rib malformations was found.
Prochlorperazine, a piperazine phenothiazine, is a commonly used anti-emetic that blocks dopamine receptors in the central nervous system. Prochlorperazine causes various extrapyramidal syndromes, with the incidence in the inpatient population estimated to be 0.5 to 0.8%. These side effects are typically manifested by motor dysfunction and easily observed on physical examination. We report the case of an 18-year-old male with C4 complete quadriplegia who developed an acute dystonic reaction isolated to the tongue during short-term treatment with prochlorperazine. This case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion in the spinal cord population, considering that many key physical findings may be absent below the level of function.
Isoniazid is an effective and widely used drug in tuberculosis treatment. The administration of toxic amounts of INH causes recurrent seizures, profound metabolic acidosis, coma and even death but therapeutic dose of isoniazid is a very rare cause of seizures. We present a case of 44-year-old HIV positive African-American female who was recently started on a preventive dose of INH after being found purified protein derivative (PPD) positive. She developed status-epilepticus that did not respond to most of the antiepileptics. As soon as she received intravenous pyridoxine, the seizures terminated abruptly.
Human multiple myeloma is a presently incurable hematologic malignancy, and novel biologically based therapies are urgently needed. GCS-100 is a polysaccharide derived from citrus pectin in clinical development for the treatment of cancer. Here we show that GCS-100 induces apoptosis in various multiple myeloma cell lines, including those resistant to dexamethasone, melphalan, or doxorubicin. Examination of purified patient multiple myeloma cells showed similar results. Specifically, GCS-100 decreases viability of bortezomib/PS-341-resistant multiple myeloma patient cells. Importantly, GCS-100 inhibits multiple myeloma cell growth induced by adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells; overcome the growth advantage conferred by antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, heat shock protein-27, and nuclear factor-kappaB; and blocks vascular endothelial growth factor-induced migration of multiple myeloma cells. GCS-100-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 followed by proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme. Combined with dexamethasone, GCS-100 induces additive anti-multiple myeloma cytotoxicity associated with mitochondrial apoptotic signaling via release of cytochrome c and Smac followed by activation of caspase-3. Moreover, GCS-100 + dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells is accompanied by a marked inhibition of an antiapoptotic protein Galectin-3, without significant alteration in Bcl-2 expression. Collectively, these findings provide the framework for clinical evaluation of GCS-100, either alone or in combination with dexamethasone, to inhibit tumor growth, overcome drug resistance, and improve outcome for patients with this universally fatal hematologic malignancy.
The toxicity mechanisms of mercury and tin organic derivatives are still under debate. Generally the presence of organic moieties in their molecules makes these compounds lipophilic and membrane active species. The recent results suggest that Hg and Sn compounds deplete HS-groups in proteins, glutathione and glutathione-dependent enzymatic systems; this process also results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the enhancement of membrane lipids peroxidation and damage of the antioxidative defence system. The goal of this review is to present recent results in the studies oriented towards the role of organomercury and organotin compounds in the xenobiotic-mediated enhancement of radical production and hence in the promotion of cell damage as a result of enhanced lipids peroxidation. Moreover the conception of the carbon to metal bond cleavage that leads to the generation of reactive organic radicals is discussed as one of the mechanisms of mercury and tin organic derivatives toxicity. The possible use of natural and synthetic antioxidants as detoxification agents is described. The data collected recently and presented here are fundamentally important to recognizing the difference between the role of metal center and of organic fragments in the biochemical behavior of organomercury and organotin compounds in their interaction with primary biological targets when entering a living organism.
Ritodrine, terbutaline, and magnesium sulfate have all been used in the United States as tocolytic drugs. Studies have shown each of these drugs to be effective in suppressing preterm labor. The current study was undertaken in order to compare their relative safety and efficacy and to evaluate the effectiveness of a second drug when the first-used drug failed to stop contractions. No differences in efficacy could be demonstrated between the drugs; however, there was a marked difference in the incidence of maternal side effects. Because of an unacceptable level of side effects, we have stopped the use of terbutaline at our institution.
The objective of the present investigation was to prevent cancer of the lung by use of chemopreventive agents. Administrations of diets containing added myo-inositol or dexamethasone singly or in combination (the latter being the most potent) are being studied for this purpose. In previous work, the two compounds were shown to inhibit benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced pulmonary adenoma formation in female A/J mice when fed during the postinitiation period [ie., starting 1 week after the last of three administrations of B(a)P by oral intubation]. In the present investigation, a longer administration schedule was used, which encompasses both the initiation and the postinitiation stages of carcinogenesis. The feeding of the test compounds was started 2 weeks prior to the first dose of carcinogen and continued for the duration of the experiment. Under these conditions, reductions in tumor formation were: myo-inositol, 64%; dexamethasone, 56%; and both together, 86% (P < 0.001 for all three). Addition of both compounds resulted in the largest inhibition that has been achieved with this experimental model as used in these investigations. Studies have begun of inhibition of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone-induced pulmonary adenoma formation by myo-inositol and dexamethasone. The two compounds inhibit pulmonary carcinogenesis when fed singly or in combination. When fed throughout the entire protocol, reductions in tumor formation were: myo-inositol, 46%; dexamethasone, 41%; and both together, 71% (P < 0.001 for all three). The results of these investigations demonstrate that myo-inositol and dexamethasone inhibit pulmonary adenoma formation resulting from exposures to two major pulmonary carcinogens, B(a)P and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone.
To describe the clinical features of five patients who developed nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) after ingestion of sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY).
Retrospective observational case series.
Five patients with NAION who reported the use of sildenafil citrate before the onset of ocular symptoms.
The symptoms presented, history, ophthalmic examination, and visual field examination of each patient.
Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy developed in one eye within minutes to hours after ingestion of sildenafil. Four of the five patients had no vascular risk factors for ischemic optic neuropathy. The patients all developed unilateral blurry vision, altitudinal visual field defects, and optic disc edema. Each of the patients was noted to have a small cup-to-disc ratio in the unaffected optic nerve.
Sildenafil citrate may be associated with NAION. A small cup-to-disc ratio may be a risk factor for development of NAION in association with the use of sildenafil.
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is currently an important drug for treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and for elderly patients. However, cells from some patients show resistance to bortezomib. We have evaluated the possibility of improving bortezomib therapy with Apo2L/TRAIL, a death ligand that induces apoptosis in MM but not in normal cells. Results indicate that cotreatment with low doses of bortezomib significantly increased apoptosis of MM cells showing partial sensitivity to Apo2L/TRAIL. Bortezomib treatment did not significantly alter plasma membrane amount of DR4 and DR5 but increased Apo2L/TRAIL-induced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. Apo2L/TRAIL reverted bortezomib-induced up-regulation of beta-catenin, Mcl-1 and FLIP, associated with the enhanced cytotoxicity of combined treatment. More important, some cell lines displaying resistance to bortezomib were sensitive to Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. A cell line made resistant by continuous culture of RPMI 8226 cells in the presence of bortezomib (8226/7B) was highly sensitive to Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, RPMI 8226 cells overexpressing Mcl-1 (8226/Mcl-1) or Bcl-x(L) (8226/Bcl-x(L)) also showed enhanced resistance to bortezomib, but co-treatment with Apo2L/TRAIL reverted this resistance. These results indicate that Apo2L/TRAIL can cooperate with bortezomib to induce apoptosis in myeloma cells and can be an useful adjunct for MM therapy.
Natural killer cells have an intrinsic ability to recognize and attack some tumor cells and infected cells. Natural killer cell cytotoxicity is depressed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In particular, cell-mediated immunity is impaired after transcatheter arterial embolization, which is an effective therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. There have been reports that cimetidine can activate cellular immunity and increase the survival time in patients with some cancers. Therefore, we investigated whether cimetidine could improve cellular immunity after transcatheter arterial embolization, especially in relation to natural killer activity.
Thirty-four patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis who underwent transcatheter arterial embolization at our hospital were studied prospectively after giving informed consent. The patients were divided into three groups. In group A, 14 patients were administered 800 mg of cimetidine a day. In group-B, 13 patients were administered 40 mg of famotidine or 300 mg of nizatidine a day. In group-C 7 patients did not receive histamine 2 receptor antagonists. Natural killer cell activity in peripheral blood was measured before transcatheter arterial embolization and on days 1 and 7.
The % natural killer cell activity on day 1 was 74 in group A, 52 in group B, and 52 in group. The % activity on day 7 was 98 in group A, 71 in group B, and 82 in group C. Cimetidine group showed the significant higher % natural killer cell activity on day 1 (p = 0.032).
Our study raises the possibility that cimetidine has the effect to preserve cell-mediated immune response during transcatheter arterial embolization.
A systematic virtual screening (VS) experiment, consisting of the development of 3D-pharmacophore, screening of virtual library, synthesis, and pharmacology, is reported. The predictive pharmacophore model (correlation = 0.955) with one H-bond donor and three hydrophobic features was developed using HypoGen on a training set of 24 carbamates as AChE inhibitors. The model was validated on a test set of 40 carbamates (correlation = 0.844). The pharmacophore-based VS of virtual library led to the identification of novel carbamates as potent AChE inhibitors. The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of nine carbamates against three diverse assay systems, namely (i) in vitro Ellman method, (ii) in vivo passive avoidance test, and (iii) aldicarb-sensitivity assay, led to the discovery of orally active novel AChE inhibitors which improved scopolamine-induce cognition impairment in Swiss male mice. Finally, two novel lead compounds 85 and 86 are selected as candidate molecules for further optimization.
The toxicological relevance of effects observed at molecular stage, which occur at dose levels well below classical no-observed adverse effect levels is currently subject to controversial scientific debate. While the importance of molecular effects for the identification of a mode of action or an adverse outcome pathway is undisputed, their impact for other regulatory purposes remains uncertain. Here, we report the results of a 28-day rat-feeding study including three widely used hepatotoxic (tri)azole fungicides (cyproconazole, epoxiconazole and prochloraz) administered individually at five dose levels, ranging from slightly above the reference values to a clear toxic effect dose. Parameters analysed included pathology, histopathology, clinical chemistry and particularly effects on the molecular level. Since azole fungicides are considered to cause liver toxicity by a mechanism involving the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a known CAR activator (phenobarbital, PB) was administered to investigate potential similarities between triazoles and PB-mediated liver toxicity by pathway-focused gene expression analysis. Our results show an increase in liver weights and additionally histopathological changes (hepatocellular hypertrophy) for all substances at the top dose levels. The effects on liver weight were most pronounced for cyproconazole by which also the animals receiving the next lower dose were affected. In addition, vacuolisation of hepatocytes was observed at the top dose level. No such findings were obtained with any substance at lower doses to which consumers and operators might be exposed to. In contrast, the expression of sensitive marker genes (like some cytochrome-P-450 isoforms) was significantly affected also at the lower dose levels. While some of these changes, like the induction of genes related to fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism (e.g. Fasn, Fat/Cd36, Ppargc1a) or xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp1a1, Cyp2b1, Cyp3a2), could be associated with high dose effects like hepatocellular vacuolisation or hypertrophy, a histopathological correlate was lacking for others.
Breast cancer disease and as well as CMF-chemotherapy are associated with an increased risk for thromboembolic complications. There is evidence that effects on the hemostatic system may play an important role. To minimize the impact of tumor associated hypercoagulability, we choose to study CMF-associated effects on the hemostatic system within an adjuvant setting. Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were examined before and 24 hours after intravenous application of CMF-therapy at 17 patients with breast cancer. 16 parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis were studied. In a longitudinal analysis covering the complete 6 month treatment period we found a decrease of thromboplastin time (TPZ) factor VII (FVII) and protein C antigen (PC Ag) and activity (PC Act). Clinically relevant pathological results and cumulative effects were observed only for PC Ag and Act, while the mean values of TPZ and FVII returned to pre-treatment levels after each course of treatment. These data suggest a potential impact of CMF-chemotherapy on synthesis and activation of vitamin-K-dependent coagulation factors thus providing a possible explanation for the increased risk for thrombosis during CMF-chemotherapy.
