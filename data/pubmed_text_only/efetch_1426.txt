Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) has been associated with increased prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance abuse in exposed children and adolescents. Whether these syndromes are caused by nicotine exposure, or genetic and psychosocial adversities associated with maternal smoking is not completely clear. Animal models suggest a direct impact of PNE. However, the fact that nicotine is forcefully administrated in these paradigms raises some questions about the specificity of these findings. Pregnant C57BI/6J mice were allowed to choose drinking saccharin/nicotine solutions or pure water. Controls could choose saccharin solutions or pure water. Offspring were tested in spontaneous locomotion, fear-associated learning (trace conditioning), addictive (conditioned place preference), and depression-like (learned helplessness) behaviors. There was no significant difference in weight or pup number between the prenatal treatment groups. A significant effect of PNE was observed on spontaneous locomotion, preference for a cocaine-associated place, and latency to escape in the learned helplessness paradigm. Surprisingly, PNE mice exhibited an increased learning of trace-conditioned fear-associated cues. The hyperlocomotive behavior reported in animal models of PNE is not likely an artifact of forceful nicotine administration. The increased prevalence of ADHD, MDD and substance abuse observed in PNE children and adolescents is probably caused by direct behavioral teratogenic effects of PNE. The role of PNE as a risk factor of syndromes associated to increased learning of fear-associated cues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) warrants further evaluation.
The debate on tungsten (W) is fostered by its continuous usage in military munitions. Reports demonstrate W solubilizes in soil and can migrate into drinking water supplies and, therefore, is a potential health risk to humans. This study evaluated the reproductive, systemic and neurobehavioral effects of sodium tungstate (NaW) in rats following 70 days of daily pre-and postnatal exposure via oral gavage to 5, 62.5 and 125 mg/kg/day of NaW through mating, gestation and weaning (PND 0-20). Daily administration of NaW produced no overt evidence of toxicity and had no apparent effect on mating success or offspring physical development. Distress vocalizations were elevated in F(1) offspring from the high dose group, whereas righting reflex showed unexpected sex differences where males demonstrated faster righting than females; however, the effects were not dose-dependent. Locomotor activity was affected in both low and high-dose groups of F(1) females. Low-dose group showed increased distance traveled, more time in ambulatory movements and less time in stereotypic behavior than controls or high dose animals. The high-dose group had more time in stereotypical movements than controls, and less time resting than controls and the lowest exposure group. Maternal retrieval was not affected by NaW exposure. Tungsten analysis showed a systemic distribution of NaW in both parents and offspring, with preferential uptake within the immune organs, including the femur, spleen and thymus. Histopathological evidence suggested no severe chronic injury or loss of function in these organs. However, the heart showed histological lesions, histiocytic inflammation from minimal to mild with cardiomyocyte degeneration and necrosis in several P(0) animals of 125 mg NaW dose group. The result of this study suggests that pre and postnatal exposure to NaW may produce subtle neurobehavioral effects in offspring related to motor activity and emotionality.
Addictive use of the stimulant drug pemoline caused a delusional disorder in a middle-aged man. Discontinuance of use of the drug promptly reversed the psychosis, which subsequently recurred when pemoline was again used. Pemoline seems to be an addictive drug and has an additional property that heretofore has been attributed mainly to amphetamines--precipitation of a paranoid psychosis.
Among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), warfarin use before onset leads to greater mortality. In a retrospective study, we sought to determine whether warfarin use is associated with larger initial hematoma volume, one determinant of mortality after ICH.
We identified all patients hospitalized with ICH in the Greater Cincinnati region from January through December 2005. ICH volumes were measured on the first available brain scan by using the abc/2 method. Univariable analyses and a multivariable generalized linear model were used to determine whether international normalized ratio (INR) influenced initial ICH volume after adjusting for other factors, including age, race, sex, antiplatelet use, hemorrhage location, and time from stroke onset to scan.
There were 258 patients with ICH, including 51 patients taking warfarin. In univariable comparison, when INR was stratified, there was a trend toward a difference in hematoma volume by INR category (INR <1.2, 13.4 mL; INR 1.2-2.0, 9.3 mL; INR 2.1-3.0, 14.0 mL; INR >3.0, 33.2 mL; p = 0.10). In the model, compared with patients with INR <1.2, there was no difference in hematoma size for patients with INR 1.2-2.0 (p = 0.25) or INR 2.1-3.0 (p = 0.36), but patients with INR >3.0 had greater hematoma volume (p = 0.02). Other predictors of larger hematoma size were ICH location (lobar compared with deep cerebral, p = 0.02) and shorter time from stroke onset to scan (p < 0.001).
Warfarin use was associated with larger initial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) volume, but this effect was only observed for INR values >3.0. Larger ICH volume among warfarin users likely accounts for part of the excess mortality in this group.
Baicalein may act on the benzodiazepine binding sites to exert an anxiolytic-like effect in mice. Since many benzodiazepine drugs have amnesic side-effect and baicalein can protect cultured cortical neurons from beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced toxicity, this study examined the amnesic effect of baicalein and its effects on beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35) (3 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.)-induced amnesia in mice. Using the step-through passive avoidance test, the results showed that baicalein (10-100 mg/kg, i.p.), unlike the benzodiazepine drug chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, i.p.), had no significant amnesic effect. Baicalein (10-50 mg/kg, i.p.) also had no facilitating effect on the learning and memory. However, one dosage pretreatment, but not post-treatment, of baicalein (5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia. Interestingly, post-treatment for 7 or 13 days of baicalein (10-15 mg/kg/day, i.p.), like melatonin (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.), also attenuated beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia. Therefore, this study demonstrated that baicalein has protective effect on beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia.
A comparison was made of the severity of chronic doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in genetically related normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Groups of SHR and WKY were given 12 weekly iv injections of doxorubicin at 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg. When the study was concluded, mean arterial pressure was 127 to 161 nm Hg in doxorubicin-treated SHR compared with 74 to 87 mm Hg in similarly treated WKY. Lesions, consisting mainly of cytoplasmic vacuolization and myofibrillar loss, were noted in the hearts from both types of rats given the 1.0-mg/kg dose and were considerably more severe in SHR than in WKY (average scores 3.8 and 2.0). Renal lesions (glomerular vacuolization and dilatation of tubules with accumulations of proteinaceous material) were of comparable severity in both types of rats at the 9- and 12-mg/kg cumulative doses; however, they were more severe in SHR at the 6-mg/kg cumulative dose. Moderate cardiac alterations were present in all SHR (average score 1.6) given 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg; at the same dose, lesions were minimal in two and absent in three WKY. In a second study, groups of rats were killed 1 week after 3,6,9, or 12 weekly iv injections of doxorubicin (1.0 mg/kg). Myocardial lesions were noted initially in SHR after six doses and in WKY after nine doses. Three of five SHR were dead by the 12th dose. These results indicate that spontaneously hypertensive rats are much more sensitive than normotensive rats to the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin.
We have previously shown that phosgene markedly increases lung weight gain and pulmonary vascular permeability in rabbits. The current experiments were designed to determine whether cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived mediators contribute to the phosgene induced lung injury. We exposed rabbits to phosgene (1,500 ppm/min), killed the animals 30 min later, and then perfused the lungs with a saline buffer for 90 min. Phosgene markedly increased lung weight gain, did not appear to increase the synthesis of cyclooxygenase metabolites, but increased 10-fold the synthesis of lipoxygenase products. Pre- or posttreatment with indomethacin decreased thromboxane and prostacyclin levels without affecting leukotriene synthesis and partially reduced the lung weight gain caused by phosgene. Methylprednisolone pretreatment completely blocked the increase in leukotriene synthesis and lung weight gain. Posttreatment with 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), a nonmetabolized competitive inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism, or the leukotriene receptor blockers, FPL 55712 and LY 171883, also dramatically reduced the lung weight gain caused by phosgene. These results suggest that lipoxygenase products contribute to the phosgene-induced lung damage. Because phosgene exposure did not increase cyclooxygenase synthesis or pulmonary arterial pressure, we tested whether phosgene affects the lung's ability to generate or to react to thromboxane. Infusing arachidonic acid increased thromboxane synthesis to the same extent in phosgene-exposed lungs as in control lungs; however, phosgene exposure significantly reduced pulmonary vascular reactivity to thromboxane but not to angiotension II and KCl.
Previous studies of intrathecal ketamine use in humans have documented the clinical effects of its administration without reference to local central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (Reich and Silvay, 1989). Although several post-mortem studies in small groups of rabbits, monkeys, and baboons have largely shown no significant CNS damage after intrathecal ketamine use, a study in rats reported vacuolation of dorsal root ganglia (Ahuja, 1983). We report post-mortem CNS histopathological changes of subpial spinal cord vacuolation in a terminally ill cancer patient who received continuous infusion intrathecal ketamine at a rate of 5 mg/day for a duration of 3 weeks.
The concentrations of cyclic 3', 5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic 3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the cerebellar and cerebral cortex were measured during lidocaine infusion and during bicuculline-induced seizures in rats. The rats were divided into three groups: control, lidocaine (0.74 mg/min) and bicuculline (1.2 mg/kg). The lidocaine group was divided into four stages according to the EEG pattern; desynchronized, synchronized, seizure and recovery. At the desynchronized and synchronized stages, cGMP and cAMP concentrations in both cerebellar and cerebral cortex remained unchanged except for a modest decrease in cerebral cGMP at the desynchronized stage. At the seizure stage, cerebellar cGMP increased from 5.2 +/- 0.9 to 9.2 +/- 1.4 pmol/mg protein and cerebellar cAMP decreased from 8.9 +/- 0.6 to 6.9 +/- 0.6 pmol/mg protein. These changes in concentrations at the seizure stage returned to the control at the recovery stage. During bicuculline-induced seizures, cGMP and cAMP concentrations increased strikingly in both cerebellar and cerebral cortex. These results indicated that lidocaine-induced seizures were accompanied by significant changes in cerebellar cyclic nucleotide concentrations in rats.
A 64-year-old man developed a severe generalized pruritic morbilliform skin eruption, fever, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis, and liver dysfunction 30 days after ingestion of mexiletine, a sodium channel blocker, prescribed to treat postherpetic neuralgia. Following intravenous dexamethasone, body temperature normalized the next day. However, the skin eruption did not disappear completely for 4 weeks. The patch test was positive for mexiletine. Clinical features and the result of patch test indicated that the patient developed hypersensitivity syndrome, a severe adverse cutaneous drug reaction, caused by mexiletine. We propose that mexiletine be added to the list of drugs that can cause severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions and that patients receiving mexiletine be warned to stop taking the drug immediately if a skin eruption occurs.
Trandolapril is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has been extensively investigated in vitro, in animals, in normal volunteers, and in hypertensive patients. It has been shown to exert all the effects typical for the class of ACE inhibitors, and has a marked impact on the reversal of structural hypertrophy of the myocardium and the arterial wall. Trandolapril is a prodrug that must be hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, trandolaprilat. This latter compound exhibits a particularly high affinity for converting enzyme, which results in a slow dissociation and one of the longest durations of action of any converting enzyme inhibitor known so far. Trandolapril reduces blood pressure consistently throughout the 24-hour period following intake. Accordingly, trandolapril, more than any other drug of its class, can be considered a true, once-a-day antihypertensive drug.
The Aalpha-fibrinogen Thr312Ala polymorphism, which occurs in a region involved in factor XIII (FXIII)-dependent cross-linking processes, is associated with poststroke mortality in subjects with atrial fibrillation, suggesting an influence either on intraatrial clot formation or embolization. We have determined the association of Thr312Ala with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and have assessed the interaction of Thr312Ala with the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism in 122 patients with DVT, 99 patients with PE, and 254 healthy control subjects. The genotype distribution of patients with PE (TT = 49%, TA = 36%, AA = 15%), but not DVT (TT = 50%, TA = 42%, AA = 8%), differed significantly from healthy control subjects (TT = 60%, TA = 34%, AA = 6%, P =.02). A significant interaction of Thr312Ala and Val34Leu was also identified (P =.01), indicating an inverse association between Leu34 and Ala312. These results support the hypothesis that Thr312Ala alters FXIII-dependent cross-linking, making formed fibrin clot more susceptible to embolization.
Vigabatrin (VGB) is a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug designed to inhibit GABA-transaminase, effectively halting seizures. Unfortunately, VGB treatment is also associated with the highest frequencies of peripheral visual field constriction of any of the antiepileptic drugs and the mechanisms that lead to these visual field defects are uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated light exposure exacerbates vigabatrin-induced retinal toxicity. We further assessed this relationship by examining the effects of vigabatrin treatment on the retinal structures of mice with genetically altered photoreception. In keeping with previous studies, we detected increased toxicity in mice exposed to continuous light. To study whether cone or rod photoreceptor function was involved in the pathway to toxicity, we tested mice with mutations in the cone-specific Gnat2 or rod-specific Pde6g genes, and found the mutations significantly reduced VGB toxicity. Our results confirm light is a significant enhancer of vigabatrin toxicity and that a portion of this is mediated, directly or indirectly, by phototransduction signaling in rod and cone photoreceptors.
The experiment was carried out on Wistar rat males weighing about 200 g. Animals from the control group received water and standard granulated fodder ad libitum. Animals from control group II received 20% ethanol ad libitum instead of water. Animals from experimental group I received cephalexin in the single dose of 42 mg/24h, Animals from experimental group II received cephalexin in the dose of 42 mg/24h and 20% ethanol ad libitum. After 10 days animals were decapitated. Histological examinations (H+E staining and PAS reaction) were made on 7 micro thick paraffin slices. It was stated that ethanol causes hyperemia of the renal parenchyma and cephalexin stimulates diuresis. However, concomitant administration of ethanol and cephalexin causes functional changes (inhibition of diuresis) and degenerative changes in capillary loops of some renal corpuscles apart from hyperemia.
Ventricular fibrillation during coronary angiography with Renografin-76 has been attributed to the high osmolar ionic and calcium binding additive properties. Isovue-370 is a new low osmolar nonionic contrast medium lacking calcium binding additives. The present investigation compared the incidence of contrast media-induced ventricular fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary angiography with Renografin-76 to that with Isovue-370. Group I consisted of 2,000 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography with Renografin-76, and group II consisted of 2,000 subsequent consecutive patients in whom Isovue-370 was employed as the contrast medium. There was no significant difference between groups I and II with respect to volume of contrast media used per patient (125 +/- 35 vs. 140 +/- 45 ml), age (63.5 +/- 15 vs. 60 +/- 17 years), sex (74% male vs. 76% male), ejection fraction (55% vs. 55%), valvular heart disease (8% vs. 9%), prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (5.8% vs. 5%), or extent of coronary artery disease. Contrast media-induced ventricular fibrillation occurred in 20 patients in group I (incidence 1%), whereas eight episodes occurred in group II (incidence 0.4%) (P less than 0.03). Thus the present investigation suggests that the incidence of ventricular fibrillation during coronary angiography can be significantly decreased by using low osmolar nonionic contrast media lacking calcium binding additives.
Although cocaine use is a significant public health problem, there is a paucity of scientific data on long-term neurobehavioral effects. This study examined the dose-related association between chronic cocaine use and neurobehavioral performance. A battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to 30 abstinent chronic cocaine abusers and 21 non-drug-using control subjects matched for age, education, and intelligence. After controlling for age, education, and intellectual ability, greater use of cocaine (grams per week) was associated with larger decrements on tests measuring executive functioning, visuoperception, psychomotor speed, and manual dexterity. These results suggest that chronic cocaine use is associated with persistent decrements in cognitive function that are most pronounced in heavy users. Knowledge of specific cognitive processing deficits in chronic cocaine users would be useful for designing individually tailored drug treatment programs.
Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a neurotrophic factor with important effects in survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons that has been suggested to play important roles in drug of abuse-induced neurotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we have studied the effects of amphetamine (10 mg/kg, four times, every 2 h) on the nigrostriatal pathway of PTN genetically deficient (PTN-/-) mice. We found that amphetamine causes a significantly enhanced loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum of PTN-/- mice compared to wild type (WT+/+) mice. In addition, we found a significant decrease ( approximately 20%) of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons only in the substantia nigra of amphetamine-treated PTN-/- mice, whereas this area of WT+/+ animals remained unaffected after amphetamine treatment. This effect was accompanied by enhanced amphetamine-induced astrocytosis in the substantia nigra of PTN-/- mice. Interestingly, we found a significant decrease in the phosphorylation levels of p42 extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK2) in both saline- and amphetamine-treated PTN-/- mice, whereas phosphorylation of p44 ERK (ERK1) was almost abolished in the striatum of PTN-/- mice compared to WT+/+ mice, suggesting that basal deficiencies in the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 could underlie the higher vulnerability of PTN-/- mice to amphetamine-induced neurotoxic effects. The data suggest an important role of PTN in the protection of nigrostriatal pathways against amphetamine insult.
A 40-year-old woman presented with 3 episodes of abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated edema of the small bowel. Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) showed diffuse swelling of the small intestine, petechial bleeding in the jejunum, and focal inflammation of the ileum. Pain and small bowel edema resolved spontaneously within 48 h during each episode. Review of the patient's history revealed that she had been started on enalapril for arterial hypertension two weeks before her first episode. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema of the small bowel was suspected and enalapril was discontinued. The patient remained symptom-free after discontinuing the ACE inhibitor. Review of the literature reveals only 11 similar cases with this case being the first to apply DBE to visualize macroscopic alterations to the small intestine. Angioedema of the intestine is a diagnostic pitfall frequently leading to prolonged diagnostic procedures and is a potential cause for abdominal pain in patients taking ACE inhibitors.
Amantadine hydrochloride and rimantadine hydrochloride are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for prophylaxis of influenza A. While data suggest that rimantadine is better tolerated, there are no data examining the rate of adverse reactions in elderly patients who receive amantadine vs rimantadine. Our objective was to assess the adverse reaction rate in elderly nursing home patients receiving sequential amantadine and rimantadine for influenza A prophylaxis.
Data were collected in 156 nursing home patients (70% women; mean+/-SD age, 83.7+/-10.1 years) in a single care setting who received sequential therapy with amantadine and rimantadine during the 1997-1998 influenza season. Patients were assessed for central nervous system adverse effects and therapy discontinuation occurring with each agent.
Twenty-nine (18.6%) of the 156 patients experienced an adverse effect when receiving amantadine compared with 3 patients (1.9%) when rimantadine was given (P<.01). Drug use was discontinued due to adverse events in 17.3% (n = 27) of the amantadine courses and 1.9% (n=3) of the rimantadine courses (P<.001). Confusion was the most frequently observed adverse event (amantadine, 10.6%; rimantadine, 0.6%; P<.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that significant risk factors for central nervous system adverse events included male sex (odds ratio, 3.65), reduced calculated creatinine clearance (odds ratio, 1.78), and use of amantadine (odds ratio, 12.73).
Amantadine use was associated with a significantly higher incidence of central nervous system adverse events than rimantadine use in this elderly population receiving influenza prophylaxis. In addition, the discontinuation rate of amantadine was significantly higher than that with rimantadine.
Deoxycorticosterone acetate-induced hypertension is a volume overload and human primary aldosteronism model characterized by severe cardiac lesions attributed to elevated inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. An important cytoprotective pathway that counteracts tissue insults is the heme oxygenase (HO) system. Although the HO-1 gene promoter contains consensus binding sites for proinflammatory/oxidative transcription factors like nuclear factor-kappaB, activating protein (AP)-1, and AP-2, the effects of HO inducers on these transcription factors in cardiac lesions of deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertension are not fully understood. Hemin therapy normalized systolic blood pressure and markedly reduced the left:right ventricular ratio, left ventricular wall thickness, and left ventricle:body weight ratio, whereas the HO blocker, chromium mesoporphyrin, exacerbated cardiac fibrosis/hypertrophy in deoxycorticosterone acetate-hypertensive rats. The cardioprotection by hemin was accompanied by increased HO-1, HO activity, cGMP, superoxide dismutase, catalase, the total antioxidant capacity alongside the reduction of 8-isoprostane, AP-1, AP-2, nuclear factor-kappaB, and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase, whereas chromium mesoporphyrin abolished the hemin effects. Furthermore, hemin therapy attenuated transforming growth factor-beta(1) and extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin and collagen, with a corresponding reduction of histopathologic lesions, including longitudinal/cross-sectional muscle fiber thickness, scarring, muscular hypertrophy, coronary arteriolar thickening, and collagen deposition. The suppression of AP-1, AP-2, nuclear factor-kappaB, and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase proinflammatory/oxidative mediators in the left ventricle of hemin-treated animals is a novel observation that may account for cardioprotection in deoxycorticosterone acetate hypertension. By concomitantly upregulating HO activity and cGMP and potentiating the total antioxidant status, hemin therapy reduced hypertension, suppressed oxidative stress, and attenuated extracellular matrix and remodeling proteins, with a reduction of histopathologic lesions that characterize cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and end-stage organ damage.
In this study, we have examined the role of glutamine derivatives in reducing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced epithelial damage in an undifferentiated crypt intestinal cell line, IEC-6. In this model, we have investigated proliferation indirectly by detecting the enzyme-derived formazan dye from the tetrazolium salt WST-1 in viable cells at 24 and 48 h after 5-FU treatment. Migration was measured at 12 and 24 h after razor scraping of the cell monolayer. Cell death was measured by quantifying the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic figures by flow cytometry at 12 and 24 h following 5-FU challenge. Neither glutamine nor alanyl-glutamine prevented 5-FU-induced apoptosis and necrosis in IEC-6 cells at 12 and 24 h after 5-FU challenge. However, glutamine and alanyl-glutamine enhanced migration and proliferation when compared with 5-FU-treated controls (P < 0.05). These new findings support our earlier study on the benefit of oral glutamine in enhancing epithelial recovery after 5-FU challenge.
Reflex modification is a versatile procedure for the assessment of sensory function because it can provide information about the responses of several sensory systems to both weak and intense stimuli. The procedure has two elements: The elicitation of some reflex, such as the acoustic startle reflex, and the modification of that reflex by preliminary stimuli. In these experiments we used reflex modification and reflex elicitation procedures to examine the normal development of auditory function in rats and to evaluate alterations in auditory function produced by physical and toxic insult. Adult rats exposed to octave bands of noise demonstrated frequency-specific deficits on a test of reflex modification, but not reflex elicitation. In the studies of developing rats, reflex elicitation appeared by postnatal day 12 and modification around day 14. Frequency-specific increases in both measures suggested that the phenomena were sensitive to auditory development and, not simply, motor development. Exposure to kanamycin on postnatal days 8 to 16 produced dose-related deficits in the ability to detect stimuli at 32 and 16 kHz, but not 4 and 0.8 kHz. These effects were observed in the absence of changes in reflex elicitation. The results demonstrate that reflex modification procedures provide more sensitive and specific information than that provided by the use of reflex elicitation alone.
The healing of gastric ulcers requires not only the complete epithelial covering but also the restitution of connective tissue. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and its downstream mediator, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), are potent stimulators for connective tissue formation during wound healing. The expression of TGF-beta, CTGF and type III collagen mRNA in indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers in rat, was investigated by Northern blot analysis. We also examined the localization of CTGF producing cells by in situ hybridization. Northern blot analysis showed expression of TGF-beta mRNA on days 1 and 3 after indomethacin administration, expression of CTGF mRNA on days 1, 3 and 7 and type III collagen mRNA expression on days 1, 3, 7 and 12, respectively. Control animals showed no expression of TGF-beta, CTGF or type III collagen mRNA. In situ hybridization showed CTGF mRNA positive cells on days 1, 3 and 7 after ulcer induction in fibroblast-like cells and in some of the blood vessels. Thus our findings indicate that growth factor CTGF, together with TGF-beta, participates in gastric ulcer healing by regulating connective tissue formation and angiogenesis. These results are compatible with the role of CTGF as a downstream mediator of TGF-beta effects.
Single dose intravenous amiodarone has been widely used and shown to be effective to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythemias in cardiac surgery. We, herein, report a 60-year-old female patient, sustaining cardiogenic shock in the course of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for unstable angina unrelieved by medication including nitroglycerin, succumbed to a life-saving emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operation at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) following a 180 mg bolus dose of amiodarone (3 mg/kg) directed at the ventricular arrhythmias, triggered by protamine and unresponsive to lidocaine treatment. Amiodaroneinduced asystole and vasoplegia were thought to be the causation of the failure of resuscitation. The causes of the development of these complications, the potential hazards of its use and the management relative to the consequential complications are reviewed and discussed.
