To evaluate whether imidazole salicylate, a recently developed NSAID, can interfere with the antihypertensive effect of atenolol and to compare its action with that of indomethacin, 9 essential hypertensives, while on prolonged (more than 1 month) treatment with atenolol (100 mg qd) received, according to a double-blind cross-over study, imidazole salicylate (750 mg t.i.d.) or indomethacin (50 mg b.i.d. plus a placebo tablet) for 1 week, reverting the treatment after a 2-week wash-out period. While indomethacin addition significantly increased blood pressure, when compared to atenolol alone, imidazole salicylate did not change it. These data show that imidazole salicylate, unlike indomethacin, does not reduce the antihypertensive effect of atenolol.
Mutations in the gene coding for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) cause Rett syndrome (RTT) and have also been reported in a number of X-linked mental retardation syndromes. Furthermore, putative mutations recently have been described in a few autistic patients and a boy with language disorder and schizophrenia. In this study, DNA samples from individuals with schizophrenia and other psychiatric diseases were scanned in order to explore whether the phenotypic spectrum of mutations in the MECP2 gene can extend beyond the traditional diagnoses of RTT in females and severe neonatal encephalopathy in males. The coding regions, adjacent splicing junctions, and highly conserved segments of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) were examined in 214 patients, including 106 with schizophrenia, 24 with autism, and 84 patients with other psychiatric diseases by detection of virtually all mutations-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (DOVAM-S). To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of variants in conserved regions of the 3'-UTR of this gene. A total of 5.2 kb per haploid gene was analyzed (1.5 Mb for 214 patients). A higher frequency of missense and 3'-UTR variants was found in autism. One missense and two 3'-UTR variants were found in 24 patients with autism versus one patient with a missense change in 144 ethnically similar individuals without autism (P = 0.009). These mutations suggest that a possible association between MECP2 mutations and autism may warrant further study.
Rapid cycling affective disorder (RC) is defined as the presence of at least four affective episodes per year. We report two RC patients whose first manic episodes were considered to be induced by clomipramine. The first case, a 61-year-old female, suffered from RC after a manic episode with respect to oral administration of clomipramine. The second case, a 45-year-old female, showed cycle acceleration after a manic episode regarding intravenous drip infusion treatment with clomipramine. They had no manic or hypomanic episodes before the administration of clomipramine. We discuss the possible induction and worsening of RC through clomipramine-induced mania.
This naturalistic study examined the admissions and re-admissions of 341 intravenous (IV) and non-IV cocaine abusers over a 3-year period to an inpatient, hospital-based drug-and-alcohol detoxification treatment program. IV cocaine abusers reported higher rates of residential instability, unemployment, Hepatitis C, HIV and cirrhosis than non-IV cocaine abusers. In addition, IV cocaine abusers were administered more medical evaluative tests during treatment and accessed inpatient detoxification treatment more often during the 3-year study period. A Cox regression model demonstrated that residential instability and IV route of cocaine administration were significant predictors of inpatient detoxification re-admission. In light of the important differences between IV and non-IV cocaine-abusing groups, detoxification services should view route of cocaine administration as a key topic in treatment delivery and residential stability as an important topic in the discharge-and-referral process.
Twenty-nine patients with bladder carcinoma treated with intravesical thiotepa administration were reviewed to assess hematologic toxicity. Ten of 25 consecutive patients had at least one episode of acute myelosuppression. Thrombocytopenia was the most common abnormality; anemia was uncommon. Acute suppression occurred most often within the first three months of therapy and was dose related. One of the 25 patients and four additional patients had chronic myelosuppression; all were male. They were older and had received more thiotepa over a longer period than those patients without chronic myelosuppression. Thrombocytopenia was again the most common abnormality. Anemia was nearly as frequent in this subpopulation and may herald chronic blood dyscrasia. One patient had refractory anemia with an excess of blast forms; another had smoldering leukemia. Acute and chronic forms of myelosuppression were not related. Thiotepa treatments should be limited to 90 mg/mo and protracted therapy avoided in elderly men.
Fifteen patients with relapsed (10) or primarily refractory (5) acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were treated with a combination of cytosine arabinoside (3 g/m2 i.v. every 12 h, 12 doses, days 1-6), 6-thioguanine (100 mg/m2 orally every 12 h, 12 doses, days 1-6) and daunomycin (60 mg/m2 i.v. on days 5 and 6 only). Complete remission was achieved in 11 patients. Eight of 10 relapsed patients and 3 of 5 primarily refractory patients entered remission. Median remission duration was 7.5 months (2-36+ months). Ten of the 11 remissions resulted from a single induction course. The time to hematologic recovery was comparable to that seen with 'standard'-dose cytosine arabinoside regimens. Nonhematologic toxicity, although considerable, was not greater than that seen with high-dose cytosine arabinoside alone. The most significant problem was gastrointestinal toxicity with diarrhea occurring in the majority of patients. Mild neurologic toxicity (reversible cerebellar dysfunction) occurred in 2 patients.
To evaluate the peripheral mechanisms of erectile dysfunction (ED) in a rat model of triple-binge cocaine administration.
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=24) were divided into two groups: group 1, control rats receiving vehicle (saline); group 2, rats receiving binge cocaine injections. After completion of triple-binge cocaine or saline injections, both groups underwent an in vivo, neurogenic-mediated erectile response protocol to assess intracavernosal pressure (ICP). Penile endothelin-A and -B receptors (ET(A)R and ET(B)R), plasma levels of big endothelin-1 (big-ET-1), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression were assessed. To analyze nitric oxide (NO) production, we measured plasma nitrate-nitrite levels and quantitated myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in cavernosal tissues to determine reactive oxygen species generation. Endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation responses were evaluated in vitro. Data were analyzed with Student t test.
Triple-binge cocaine administration caused significantly decreased erectile responses as measured by ICP in vivo. Plasma big-ET-1 levels were significantly increased in the triple-binge cocaine treatment group compared with control animals. In the penis, triple-binge cocaine administration significantly increased ET(A)R expression compared with saline controls, while ET(B)R expression was not altered. Cocaine-treated rats had significantly decreased eNOS expression and NO production. The activity of tissue MPO was significantly increased in the cocaine group compared with control rats. Organ bath studies demonstrated that triple-binge cocaine resulted in a 64% reduction in maximal relaxation compared with the control group.
This study demonstrates that triple-binge cocaine administration significantly reduces erectile function in rats. The pathophysiologic mechanisms that are likely involved include increased plasma big-ET-1 levels, increased penile ET(A)R expression, increased penile MPO activity, and reduced penile eNOS expression.
In the present study, the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NMDA receptor agonist and antagonist on impairment of memory formation and the state-dependent learning by morphine have been investigated in mice. Pretraining administration of morphine (5 mg/kg; s.c.) decreased the learning of one-trial passive avoidance task. Pretest administration of morphine (5 mg/kg) induced state-dependent learning acquired under pretraining morphine influence. Pretest administration of NMDA receptor agonist, L-glutamate (0.00001 and 0.0001 and 0.001 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) following pretraining saline treatment did not affect retention. Amnesia induced by pretraining morphine was significantly reversed by pretest administration of L-glutamate (0.0001 and 0.001 microg/mouse, i.c.v.). Pretest administration of noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (0.5, 1, and 2 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) significantly impaired memory formation. Amnesia induced by pretraining morphine was increased by pretest administration of MK-801 (2 microg/mouse, i.c.v.). Pretest coadministration of L-glutamate (0.0001 and 0.001 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) or MK-801 (0.5, 1, and 2 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) with morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) increased and decreased morphine state-dependent learning, respectively. The results suggest that NMDA receptors are involved in morphine state-dependent learning in mice.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of propranolol intoxication on the QT and QTc intervals in a canine model. Lead II surface electrocardiograms were retrospectively evaluated from a previous study performed in this laboratory. Thirteen pentobarbital-anesthetized and instrumented animals, after a 30-min baseline period, were given 10 mg/kg dl-propranolol i.v. over 10 min. The electrocardiogram was printed continuously. Average heart rate and QT interval were measured and QTc was calculated at baseline and again 1 min after propranolol infusion was complete. Data for hemodynamic parameters have been previously reported demonstrating significant cardiovascular depression in all animals and one death with the administration of propranol. The QT interval was significantly prolonged by propranolol administration from baseline at 0.257 +/- 0.039 to 0.295 +/- 0.035 s. There was no significant difference in the QTc between baseline (0.371 +/- 0.026 s) and postpropranolol (0.366 +/- 0.021 s) measurements. In this canine model of propranolol intoxication, QT interval prolongation appears to be the result of associated bradycardia. Cardiovascular depression does not appear to include a significant direct effect on ventricular repolarization, as judged by the QTc interval.
Although pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can hardly be eradicated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common genetic disease among Caucasians), these patients are mainly treated with intravenous and nebulized tobramycin. Long-term treatment with tobramycin, however, may induce ototoxic effects. We assessed the clinical histories and postmortem temporal bones of six patients with CF for signs of this ototoxicity. Four bones showed typical manifestations of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides (AGs): loss of hair cells in the lower turns, and degeneration of ganglion cells. Six bones revealed no loss or scattered loss of hair cells, however, degeneration of the spiral ganglion cells was observed. This suggests that degeneration of the spiral ganglion may occur as a primary manifestation in some cases of ototoxicity due to aminoglycosides. Recent reports have shown that trophic factors (neurotrophins and acidic fibroblast growth factor) interacting with hair cells and the spiral ganglion protect the inner ear from damage. It may be that disturbances in supply of such trophic factors caused degeneration of ganglion cells without loss of hair cells in the cases we studied.
The present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between occupational chemical exposure and incidence of cholangiocarcinoma among workers in the offset colour proof-printing section of a small printing company in Osaka, Japan.
We identified 51 men who had worked in the proof-printing room, and 11 men who had worked in the front room for at least 1 year between 1991 and 2006. We interviewed them about the chemicals they used, and estimated their levels of exposure to chemicals. We also investigated the medical records of 11 cholangiocarcinoma patients, and calculated the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) from 1991 to 2011.
Workers used 1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-DCP) from approximately 1985 to 2006, and dichloromethane (DCM) from approximately 1985 to 1997/1998. Exposure concentrations were estimated to be 100-670 ppm for 1,2-DCP and 80-540 ppm for DCM among the proof-printing workers. All 11 patients were pathologically diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. Ages at diagnosis were 25-45 years, and ages at death were 27-46 years among the six deceased individuals. The primary cancer site was the intrahepatic bile duct for five patients, and the extrahepatic bile ducts for six. All patients were exposed to 1,2-DCP for 7-17 years and diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma 7-20 years after their first exposure. Ten patients were also exposed to DCM for 1-13 years. The SMR for cholangiocarcinoma was 2900 (expected deaths: 0.00204, 95% CI 1100 to 6400) for all workers combined.
These findings suggest that 1,2-DCP and/or DCM may cause cholangiocarcinoma in humans.
Phytoestrogens are nonsteroidal plant compounds that are able to exert estrogenic effects. Soybean is a rich source of phytoestrogens, especially isoflavones. Soy isoflavones are utilized for estrogen replacement therapy. Estrogen is reported to influence several areas of brain that are involved in cognition and behavior. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine whether dietary supplementation with soybean improves the cognitive function of mice. Soybean was administered in three different concentrations (2%, 5% and 10% [wt/wt]) in the normal diet to young and mature mice for 60 successive days. The passive avoidance paradigm and the elevated plus maze served as the exteroceptive behavioral models, whereas scopolamine (1.4 mg/kg, i.p.) served as the interoceptive behavioral model. The brain acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) activity, brain thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), and total blood cholesterol levels were also measured in the present study. The administration of soybean for 60 consecutive days protected (P < .05) the animals from developing memory impairment. Soybean administration also resulted in diminished brain AChE activity, decrease in brain TBARS, and increase in GSH levels, thereby indicating facilitated cholinergic transmission, reduced free radical generation, and enhanced scavenging of free radicals. Thus, soybean appears to be a useful remedy for improving memory and for the management of cognitive deficits owing to its pro-estrogenic, antioxidant, procholinergic, and/or neuroprotective properties.
The oral anti-inflammatory activity of 4,4'-dihydroxy-alpha-truxillic acid (1) was compared with that of two other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, loxoprofen sodium (LOX) and diclofenac sodium (DIC). The activity of 1 against the inflammatory pain response induced by formalin was comparable to that of LOX, but weaker than that of DIC. In the monosodium urate (MSU)-induced acute inflammatory model, 1 showed stronger anti-inflammatory activity than both LOX and DIC. The ED50 value for 1 was 4.5 micromol/kg, while the values for LOX and DIC were 65 and 25 micromol/kg, respectively. Otherwise, the oral single-dose toxicity of 1 was investigated in both sexes of Sprague-Dawley rats administered once at a dose of 2000 mg/kg. 1 showed no death, clinical signs, changes in body weight or pathological findings related to the treatment. In addition, no mutagenicity was observed in the reverse mutation assay. Furthermore, 1 did not show any ulcerogenic activity at doses ranging from 30 to 300 mg/kg in rat. Thus, 1 might be considered to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent with no deleterious adverse effect.
To report treatment and outcome in patients with malignant and benign pheochromocytoma and abdominal paraganglioma.
Review of clinical and therapeutic features in 85 patients with pheochromocytoma or abdominal paraganglioma between 1976 and 1999.
Thirty-nine of 85 patients presented with symptoms other than classical paroxysmal attacks. Paragangliomas were more often malignant (7/15) than pheochromocytomas (7/70). No recurrences have occurred in 71 patients with tumours initially classified as benign after a median follow-up time of 144 months (range 7-287). Nine of 14 patients with tumours classified as malignant have developed metastasis and/or local recurrence. Treatment of malignant tumours with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and dacarbazine (CVD) improved or stabilised the disease in three of four patients.
Life long follow-up of patients with benign pheochromocytoma is not necessary. Combination chemotherapy (CVD) is a valid option in the treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas and abdominal paragangliomas.
The endocrine disrupting compound bisphenol-A (BPA) has been reported to act as an obesogen in rodents exposed perinatally. In this study, we investigated the effects of early-life BPA exposure on adult metabolic phenotype and hypothalamic energy balance circuitry. Pregnant and lactating CD-1 dams were exposed, via specially prepared diets, to 2 environmentally relevant doses of BPA. Dams consumed an average of 0.19 and 3.49 μg/kg per day of BPA in the low and high BPA treatments prenatally and an average of 0.36 and 7.2 μg/kg per day of BPA postnatally. Offspring were weaned initially onto a normal (AIN93G) diet, then as adults exposed to either a normal or high-fat diet (HFD). Males exposed to the high dose of BPA showed impaired glucose tolerance on both diets. They also showed reduced proopiomelanocortin fiber innervation into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and when exposed to HFD, they demonstrated increased neuropeptide Y and Agouti-related peptide expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Females exposed to the high BPA dose were heavier, ate more, and had increased adiposity and leptin concentrations with reduced proopiomelanocortin mRNA expression in the ARC when consuming a HFD. BPA-exposed females showed ARC estrogen receptor α expression patterns similar to those seen in males, suggesting a masculinizing effect of BPA. These results demonstrate that early-life exposure to the obesogen BPA leads to sexually dimorphic alterations in the structure of hypothalamic energy balance circuitry, leading to increased vulnerability for developing diet-induced obesity and metabolic impairments, such as glucose intolerance.
Heterocyclic derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are often significant components of environmental contaminant mixtures; however, their contribution to the toxicity of these mixtures is not well characterized. These heterocycles commonly co-occur in PAH mixtures, which contain agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Our goal for these studies was to explore the effects of two PAH heterocycles, carbazole (CB) and dibenzothiophene (DBT), alone and in combination with a PAH-type agonist for the AHR (beta-naphthoflavone [BNF]) on AHR-mediated cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) activity and on fish embryotoxicity. Embryos of Fundulus heteroclitus were exposed to CB or DBT, with and without coexposure to BNE Carbazole alone slightly induced, whereas DBT alone slightly reduced, in ovo CYP1A-mediated ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity compared to control values. However, exposure to CB or DBT reduced in ovo EROD activity in embryos coexposed to BNE Carbazole and DBT were characterized in vitro as noncompetitive CYP1A inhibitors. Carbazole and DBT enhanced the embryotoxicity of BNF, although neither compound was embryotoxic by itself. The co-occurrence of CB and DBT with PAH-type AHR inducers in contaminated ecosystems may increase the toxicity of PAH-type AHR agonists in these settings and may need to be considered when estimating the embryotoxicity of PAH mixtures.
Glutamate receptors are well-known actors in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and altered glutamate signaling is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. It is increasingly recognized that such receptors may also have a role in tumor growth. Here we provide direct evidence of aberrant glutamate signaling in the development of a locally aggressive bone tumor, chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF). We subjected a series of CMFs to whole-genome mate-pair sequencing and RNA sequencing and found that the glutamate receptor gene GRM1 recombines with several partner genes through promoter swapping and gene fusion events. The GRM1 coding region remains intact, and 18 of 20 CMFs (90%) showed a more than 100-fold and up to 1,400-fold increase in GRM1 expression levels compared to control tissues. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that direct targeting of GRM1 is a necessary and highly specific driver event for CMF development.
Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is the most common undifferentiated ovarian malignancy in women under 40 years of age. We sequenced the exomes of six individuals from three families with SCCOHT. After discovering segregating deleterious germline mutations in SMARCA4 in all three families, we tested DNA from a fourth affected family, which also carried a segregating SMARCA4 germline mutation. All the familial tumors sequenced harbored either a somatic mutation or loss of the wild-type allele. Immunohistochemical analysis of these cases and additional familial and non-familial cases showed loss of SMARCA4 (BRG1) protein in 38 of 40 tumors overall. Sequencing of cases with available DNA identified at least one germline or somatic deleterious SMARCA4 mutation in 30 of 32 cases. Additionally, the SCCOHT cell line BIN-67 had biallelic deleterious mutations in SMARCA4. Our findings identify alterations in SMARCA4 as the major cause of SCCOHT, which could lead to improvements in genetic counseling and new treatment approaches.
Small cell carcinoma of the ovary of hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is an extremely rare, aggressive cancer affecting children and young women. We identified germline and somatic inactivating mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling gene SMARCA4 in 75% (9/12) of SCCOHT cases in addition to SMARCA4 protein loss in 82% (14/17) of SCCOHT tumors but in only 0.4% (2/485) of other primary ovarian tumors. These data implicate SMARCA4 in SCCOHT oncogenesis.
Methotrexate (MTX) is a most commonly used anti-metabolite in cancer treatment and as an anti-rheumatic drug. While MTX chemotherapy at a high dose is known to cause bone growth defects in growing bones, effects of its chronic use at a low dose on growing skeleton remain less clear. Here, we examined effects on bone growth of long-term MTX chemotherapy at a low dose in young rats, and potential protective effects of supplementary treatment with antidote folinic acid (given ip at 1 mg/kg 6 h after MTX). After two cycles of 5 once-daily MTX injections (at 0.75 mg/kg, 5 days on/9 days off/5 days on), histological analysis showed that MTX at this dose caused significant reduction in heights of growth plate and primary spongiosa bone on day 22 compared to controls (P<0.05). In contrast, a similar dosing regimen but at a lower dose (0.4 mg/kg) caused only slight or no reduction in heights of both regions. However, after the induction phase at this 0.4 mg/kg dosing, continued use of MTX at a low dose (once weekly at 0.2 mg/kg) caused a reduction in primary spongiosa height and bone volume on weeks 9 and 14, which was associated with an increased osteoclast formation and their bone surface density as well as a decreased osteoblast bone surface density in the primary spongiosa. Folinic acid supplementation was shown able to prevent the MTX effects in the primary spongiosa. These results suggest that acute use of MTX can damage growth plate and primary bone at a high dose, but not at a low dose. However, long-term use of MTX at a low dose can reduce primary bone formation probably due to decreased osteoblastic function but increased osteoclastic formation and function, and supplementary treatment with folinic acid may be potentially useful in protecting bone growth during long-term low-dose MTX chemotherapy.
Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare, highly aggressive form of ovarian cancer primarily diagnosed in young women. We identified inactivating biallelic SMARCA4 mutations in 100% of the 12 SCCOHT tumors examined. Protein studies confirmed loss of SMARCA4 expression, suggesting a key role for the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex in SCCOHT.
Lipid ratios are clinically useful markers of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The effects of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin on lipid ratios were investigated in the Measuring Effective Reductions in Cholesterol Using Rosuvastatin TherapY (MERCURY) I trial.
This trial was conducted in 3140 hypercholesterolemic patients with CAD, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or a 20% 10-year risk for CAD. Patients were randomized to rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 40 mg for 8 weeks; all patients except those receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg either were switched to rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg or remained on initial treatment for 8 more weeks.
At 8 weeks, reductions in total cholesterol (TC):high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:HDL-C, non-HDL-C:HDL-C, and apolipoprotein (apo) B:apo A-I ratios with rosuvastatin 10 mg were significantly greater than those with atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and pravastatin 40 mg (P<0.0001 for all). At week 16, switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg from atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and pravastatin 40 mg and to rosuvastatin 20 mg from atorvastatin 20 mg produced significantly greater reductions in all lipid ratios (P< or =0.0001 for all). Switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg from atorvastatin 20 mg produced significantly greater reductions in TC:HDL-C (P<0.025) and apo B:apo A-I (P<0.01).
Rosuvastatin 10 mg reduces lipid ratios more than equivalent and higher doses of other statins; switching to equal or lower doses of rosuvastatin produces significantly improved reductions in lipid ratios.
The objective of the study was to assess acute neurotoxicity associated with triple intrathecal therapy (TIT)+/-high-dose methotrexate (HD MTX) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 1395 children were enrolled on FRALLE 93 protocol from 1993 to 1999. Lower-risk group (LR, n=182) were randomized to weekly low-dose MTX at 25 mg/m(2)/week (LD MTX, n=81) or HD MTX at 1.5 g/m(2)/2 weeks x 6 (n=77). Intermediate-risk group (IR, n=672) were randomized to LD MTX (n=290) or HD MTX at 8 g/m(2)/2 weeks x 4 (n=316). Higher-risk group (HR, n=541) prednisone-responder patients received LD MTX and cranial radiotherapy. HR group steroid resistant cases were grafted (autologous or allogenic). TIT (MTX, cytarabine and methylprednisolone) was given every 2 weeks during 16-18 weeks and every 3 months during maintenance therapy in LR and IR patients. 52 patients (3.7%) developed neurotoxicity. Isolated seizures: n=15 (1.1%), peripheral and spinal neuropathy: n=17 (1.2%) and encephalopathy: n=20 (1.4%). Age >10 years was significantly associated with neurotoxicity (P=0.01) and use of HD MTX is associated with encephalopathy (P=0.03). Sequels are reported respectively in 60 and 33% of spinal neuropathy and encephalopathy cases. Current strategies tailoring risk of neurological sequels has to be defined.
We show here that clozapine, a beneficial antipsychotic, down-regulates the expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the rat cerebral cortex, thereby reducing glutamate transport and raising extracellular glutamate levels. Clozapine treatment (25--35 mg kg(-1) day(-1) orally) reduced GLT-1 immunoreactivity in several brain regions after 3 weeks; this effect was most prominent after 9 weeks and most evident in the frontal cortex. GLT-1 protein levels were reduced in the cerebral cortex of treated rats compared with controls and were more severely affected in the anterior (71.9 +/- 4.5%) than in the posterior (53.2 +/- 15.4%) cortex. L-[(3)H]-glutamate uptake in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with mRNA extracted from the anterior cerebral cortex of rats treated for 9 weeks was remarkably reduced (to 30.6 +/- 8.6%) as compared to controls. In addition, electrophysiological recordings from oocytes following application of glutamate revealed a strong reduction in glutamate uptake currents (46.3 +/- 10.2%) as compared to controls. Finally, clozapine treatment led to increases in both the mean basal (8.1 +/- 0.7 microM) and the KCl-evoked (28.7 +/- 7.7 microM) output of glutamate that were 3.1 and 3.5, respectively, higher than in control rats. These findings indicate that clozapine may potentiate glutamatergic synaptic transmission by regulating glutamate transport.
