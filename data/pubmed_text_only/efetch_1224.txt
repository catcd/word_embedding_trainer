Recent preclinical evidence indicates that the neuropeptide oxytocin may have potential in the treatment of drug dependence and drug withdrawal. Oxytocin reduces methamphetamine self-administration, conditioned place preference and hyperactivity in rodents. However, it is unclear how oxytocin acts in the brain to produce such effects. The present study examined how patterns of neural activation produced by methamphetamine were modified by co-administered oxytocin. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with either 2 mg/kg oxytocin (IP) or saline and then injected with either 2 mg/kg methamphetamine (IP) or saline. After injection, locomotor activity was measured for 80 minutes prior to perfusion. As in previous studies, co-administered oxytocin significantly reduced methamphetamine-induced behaviors. Strikingly, oxytocin significantly reduced methamphetamine-induced Fos expression in two regions of the basal ganglia: the subthalamic nucleus and the nucleus accumbens core. The subthalamic nucleus is of particular interest given emerging evidence for this structure in compulsive, addiction-relevant behaviors. When administered alone, oxytocin increased Fos expression in several regions, most notably in the oxytocin-synthesizing neurons of the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. This provides new evidence for central actions of peripheral oxytocin and suggests a self-stimulation effect of exogenous oxytocin on its own hypothalamic circuitry. Overall, these results give further insight into the way in which oxytocin might moderate compulsive behaviors and demonstrate the capacity of peripherally administered oxytocin to induce widespread central effects.
Thymidylate synthase (TS), a critical target in fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, is a prognostic marker in colon carcinomas and a predictor of response to treatment. Tumor RNA has been detected in plasma from cancer patients and is associated with poor prognosis. This is the first study to examine extracellular TS mRNA in plasma from patients with colon carcinoma, and its possible relation with TS promoter enhancer region (TSER) polymorphism.
TS expression was measured in plasma from 88 patients and 26 controls, and in a tumor subgroup of this series by quantitative PCR. Genotyping for TSER polymorphism was done in 60 patients. Clinicopathologic variables were correlated with these molecular changes.
TS mRNA was detected in plasma in 47% of patients, showing significant differences from healthy controls. Patients with TS mRNA in plasma had higher levels of TS in tumor tissue than patients without. The presence of TS mRNA was associated with lymph node metastases and more advanced stages. Polymorphism TSER 3/3 was found in 38% of cases, and was significantly correlated with high amounts of TS mRNA in plasma.
Our results suggest that TS mRNA in plasma originated from tumors, it may indicate poor prognosis and might help to classify tumors in Dukes' stages B and C. The TSER genotype may influence TS mRNA expression in plasma.
The neuroendocrine properties and the beneficial effects of cyproheptadine in tardive dyskinesia led to the testing of this drug in levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Cyproheptadine administered to 6 parkinsonian patients in doses of up to 42 mg/day was of no significant benefit in either dyskinesia or symptom control. Improvement in appetite was reported by 3 patients. These observations suggested that different mechanisms may be responsible in the pathogenesis of phenothiazine and amine-induced dyskinesia. The failure to control levodopa-induced dyskinesia selectively with serotonin agonists and antagonists and the accentuation of the dyskinesia in the presence of anticholinergic agents further suggest that substances that increase directly central cholinergic activity may be effective in the control of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.
Gene-environment interactions are important determinants of cancer risk. Traditionally, gene-environment interactions are thought to contribute to tumor-suppressor-gene penetrance by facilitating or inhibiting the acquisition of additional somatic mutations required for tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate that a distinctive type of gene-environment interaction can occur during development to enhance the penetrance of a tumor-suppressor-gene defect in the adult. Using rats carrying a germ-line defect in the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc-2) tumor-suppressor gene predisposed to uterine leiomyomas, we show that an early-life exposure to diethylstilbestrol during development of the uterus increased tumor-suppressor-gene penetrance from 65% to >90% and tumor multiplicity and size in genetically predisposed animals, but it failed to induce tumors in wild-type rats. This exposure was shown to impart a hormonal imprint on the developing uterine myometrium, causing an increase in expression of estrogen-responsive genes before the onset of tumors. Loss of function of the normal Tsc-2 allele remained the rate-limiting event for tumorigenesis; however, tumors that developed in exposed animals displayed an enhanced proliferative response to steroid hormones relative to tumors that developed in unexposed animals. These data suggest that exposure to environmental factors during development can permanently reprogram normal physiological tissue responses and thus lead to increased tumor-suppressor-gene penetrance in genetically susceptible individuals.
An experimental study in female rats demonstrated that hyperestrogenemia (unlike hypoestrogenemia or hyperthyroidism) enhanced the myocardial necrotic effect of isoprenaline. There was no clear-cut correlation between the extent of myocardial damage and cAMP phosphodiesterase activity.
A diagnosis of adverse extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) was reached in a 14-year-old female blue and gold macaw (Ara ararauna) that presented with disseminated dystonia (manifesting as pacing, head bobbing, and circling), intermittent ataxia, and coarse-muscle tremors of 60 hours duration. The patient had been treated 23 days previously with haloperidol decanoate (1.7 mg/kg IM once), and for 3 days before hospitalization with clomipramine HCl at a prescribed dosage of 3.9 mg/kg PO q12h. The patient was treated with supportive care, a gradual reduction in the clomipramine dose, and intramuscular and oral diphenhydramine (2 mg/kg q12h). As commonly observed in human patients with drug-induced EPS, a dramatic resolution of clinical signs was observed within 2 hours after the first intramuscular administration of diphenhydramine. It is recommended that EPS be considered in macaws experiencing neurologic signs secondary to clomipramine administration and, in particular, in those treated concurrently or previously with haloperidol.
Rapid intravenous (i.v.) injections of high doses (16-128 mumol/kg) of cimetidine induced a short-lasting (5-15 min) hypotension in anaesthetized rats. Diastolic pressure was reduced more than systolic pressure, suggesting vasodilatation. Heart rate was not affected. Diphenhydramine pretreatment (100 mumol/kg i.v.) did not antagonize the hypotensive effect of cimetidine. However, in the presence of diphenhydramine, cimetidine induced bradycardia. Intracerebroventricular administration of cimetidine or metiamide (2 mumol/rat) increased the blood pressure and heart rate. It is concluded that the hypotension after i.v. cimetidine is mediated by peripheral mechanisms. Since diphenhydramine pretreatment had no antagonistic effect cimetidine-induced hypotension could not be due to indirect H1-receptor stimulation caused by histamine liberation.
In coronary heart disease, beta-blockers are beneficial because they limit the increase in heart rate and blood pressure during exercise, and calcium antagonists are useful because they reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Many different pharmacological combinations of a beta-blocker and a calcium antagonist are possible, and beta-blockade may ameliorate reflex tachycardia induced by peripheral vasodilatation due to calcium antagonists, therefore enhancing the benefit. Studies have shown that combination therapy with propranolol and nifedipine, verapamil or diltiazem has greater antianginal efficacy based on symptomatic and objective assessment than either agent alone. A similar result has been reported for nifedipine or verapamil combined with atenolol. In combination, atenolol and nifedipine did not depress cardiac output or change the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest. During exercise atenolol alone resulted in a reduced LVEF response in most patients but the combination did not adversely affect left ventricular function. Nifedipine alone did not significantly change LVEF. When verapamil was combined with atenolol, resting ejection fraction fell, indicating a deterioration in cardiac function. Nifedipine and propranolol combined do not change heart rate significantly. Verapamil and atenolol both reduce resting heart rate and their combination has a greater effect; a combination of propranolol and diltiazem also reduces heart rate to a similar extent. Caution is therefore warranted when prescribing the latter 2 combinations. An increase in side effects can be expected with combination regimens compared with monotherapy; but with the nifedipine-atenolol combination the calcium antagonist can alleviate beta-blocker-induced effects by its vasodilator effect, and beta-blockers may ameliorate nifedipine-induced palpitations and flushing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Proper chromosome segregation in eukaryotes is driven by a complex superstructure called the mitotic spindle. Assembly, maintenance, and function of the spindle depend on centrosome migration, organization of microtubule arrays, and force generation by microtubule motors. Spindle pole migration and elongation are controlled by the unique balance of forces generated by antagonistic molecular motors that act upon microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Defects in components of this complex structure have been shown to lead to chromosome missegregation and genomic instability. Here, we show that overexpression of Eg5, a member of the Bim-C class of kinesin-related proteins, leads to disruption of normal spindle development, as we observe both monopolar and multipolar spindles in Eg5 transgenic mice. Our findings show that perturbation of the mitotic spindle leads to chromosomal missegregation and the accumulation of tetraploid cells. Aging of these mice revealed a higher incidence of tumor formation with a mixed array of tumor types appearing in mice ages 3 to 30 months with the mean age of 20 months. Analysis of the tumors revealed widespread aneuploidy and genetic instability, both hallmarks of nearly all solid tumors. Together with previous findings, our results indicate that Eg5 overexpression disrupts the unique balance of forces associated with normal spindle assembly and function, and thereby leads to the development of spindle defects, genetic instability, and tumors.
Barrel rotation is a unique motor response observed in rats in which, following an intracerebral injection, the animal develops a twist about the long axis and rolls laterally repeatedly. The response was first described following injection of somatostatin. We have previously shown that 'experimental dystonia' in rats induced by intraventricular chlorpromazine methiodide (CPZMI) is identical to barrel rotation, and that it is due to an antimuscarinic effect. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the neuroanatomical basis of CPZMI-induced rotation. We injected CPZMI in 3 microliters into right lateral and IVth ventricle and found that IVth ventricle injections were significantly more likely to induce rotation. Nuclear groups adjacent to the IVth ventricle, which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic receptors, include locus coeruleus and vestibular nuclear complex (VNC). We found that only VNC injections induced rotation. Only certain control compounds injected into VNC elicited the response. We conclude that barrel rotation has a specific neuroanatomical basis, involving central vestibular mechanisms, and that it has a specific pharmacologic basis.
This study was designed to examine the influence of combined therapy with bezafibrate and cholestyramine on plasma lipids and on the metabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Twenty-one type II hyperlipidemic subjects were treated with bezafibrate alone or in combination with cholestyramine. A 17% fall in plasma cholesterol was seen with bezafibrate, and addition of cholestyramine produced an additional 9% reduction in this lipid. The effectiveness of the combination therapy was mediated through a 47% decrement in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, a 37% reduction in LDL cholesterol, and a 15% increase in the level of that lipid in high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Plasma triglyceride fell 43% when bezafibrate was given alone, and did not change further when cholestyramine was added. The metabolism of LDL was examined in nine individuals to determine the mechanism underlying these changes. No significant modification in LDL synthetic rate was incurred with either drug regimen, whereas the fractional catabolic rate of LDL via the receptor pathway rose by 66% with bezafibrate alone and by 79% (compared to baseline) following the addition of cholestyramine. Plasma HDL rose during bezafibrate therapy due to an increase in the HDL3 subfraction. Compositional analysis of LDL showed a reduction in cholesterol ester and an increase in triglyceride and phospholipid during combined drug therapy. These results demonstrate that combined therapy with bezafibrate and cholestyramine markedly improves the lipoprotein profile in type II hyperlipidemia. The drugs appear to be complementary in their actions upon the LDL receptor pathway.
To investigate whether the nasal route for fentanyl administration in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) provides as effective postoperative analgesia as intravenous PCA.
Patient-controlled intranasal or intravenous analgesia with fentanyl was investigated in 48 patients (ASA I-III) on the day of surgery (orthopedic, abdominal or thyroid) in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study. Fentanyl was given in a bolus of 25 microg for intranasal and 17.5 microg for i.v. PCA, lockout interval six minutes. The first requested dose was doubled in both groups. Pain intensity (101-point numerical rating scale) and vital parameters were observed at 11 measurement points during the 240 min study. Patients were asked for side effects at every measurement point and for their satisfaction at the end of the study by the same investigator (J.M.).
Onset of analgesia, the first reduction in pain intensity on the numerical rating scale, was 21 +/- 11 min (range 15-45 min) in intranasal and 22 +/- 16 min (range 15-90 min) in i.v. PCA. Pain intensity was reduced from 55 +/- 11 to 11 +/- 10 in the intranasal group and from 53 +/- 8 to 11 +/- 6 in the i.v. PCA group. Vital parameters remained stable and side effects were comparable in both groups. The judgement "excellent" or "good" was given by 21 of 23 patients treated intranasally and 24 of 25 patients treated intravenously.
Intranasal PCA with fentanyl was an effective alternative to i.v. PCA in postoperative patients.
After major depression was diagnosed in a 83-year-old woman, fluoxetine was prescribed. Six days later she became delirious and weak, necessitating hospitalization. She was found to have hyponatremia secondary to fluoxetine-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Recovery was complete after discontinuation of the medication.
The effects of morphine on natural killer (NK) cell activity were investigated in patients who underwent hysterectomy.
Forty patients were divided into four groups of ten. The groups received intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine (Group IT0.5), intrathecal 0.1 mg morphine (Group IT0.1) or 10 mg morphine i.v. (Group IV). The remaining ten patients served as controls and received inhalation anesthesia alone (Group C). Blood samples were withdrawn before and two hours after surgery and on postoperative days one and two to determine the blood NK cell activity using a chromium release assay with K562 cells as targets, plasma catecholamines and cortisol levels. The postoperative pain score and side effects were studied in the four groups.
In Group IT0.5, the NK cell activity was lower on postoperative day 1 (23.9 +/- 8.4%) than the baseline level (45.7 +/- 13%) before surgery, and recovered on postoperative day 2. In Groups IT0.1, C and IV, the NK cell activities showed no significant changes. In all four groups, neither plasma adrenaline nor noradrenaline concentrations changed. In all four groups, the plasma cortisol levels increased after surgery, on postoperative days 1 and 2. The pain score was lower two hours after surgery and on postoperative day 1 in Group IT0.5 than in the other groups.
These results suggest that long-lasting analgesic effects of intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine suppress the immune response following abdominal surgery.
To determine the Influence of peroperative titrated morphine on postoperative pain control.
Forty patients received general anesthesia for total hip arthroplasty (THA) and were divided into two groups of 20. In the Peroperative group (Perop group;) morphine was titrated at the end of surgery (3 mg i.v. every 5 or 10 min) in spontaneously breathing intubated patients, until the respiratory rate (RR) decreased. No morphine was administered to Postop group. In the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) patients in Perop and Postop groups received morphine until adequate pain relief VAS < or = 30 mm. Patients used patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for the next 24 hr. In the PACU, the delay for analgesia, doses of morphine used and incidence of side effects were recorded.
In the Perop group, patients received 10.3 +/- 1.3 mg (2-20 mg) as peroperative titration and had achieved adequate analgesia more rapidly than in the Postop group (42 +/- 7 min vs 76 +/- 7 min); P = 0.0026). Analgesia in the PACU in the Postop group required larger doses of morphine (15.4 +/- 1.5 mg;) than in the Perop group (7.3 +/- 1.3 mg; P = 0.0004). The respiratory rate decrease during peroperative morphine titration was correlated to the morphine dose needed in the PACU (P = 0.035). Respiratory depression in the PACU was more common in the Postop group than in the Perop group (five patients vs no patient P = 0.017).
This study demonstrated that the peroperative administration of morphine can facilitate immediate postoperative pain management.
Poisoning with flecainide acetate is rare and associated with a high mortality. This usually occurs after massive ingestion but can also be observed during therapeutic overdose in patients with renal failure or with amiodarone therapy. The prognostic depends on the haemodynamic and rhythmic effects of the overdose one sign of which is widening of the QRS complexes. Major sodium bicarbonate or lactate infusion is the generally prescribed treatment. The authors report one case of a patient with renal failure on amiodarone who survived a severe flecainide acetate overdose.
The authors treated 51 patients with solid tumours with vindesine 4 mg/m2, generally every third week, in combination chemotherapy protocols scheduled according to diurnal variability of kinetics. No dose-related sensory disorders were observed: On the contrary, motor toxicity appeared cumulative: 1) Early depression of osteotendinous reflexes from the first course onward, with progressive deterioration. No more normal reflexes could be evoked after 55 mg; 2) Early appearance of neurogenic pattern in the electromyograph after 5-10 mg. Progressive alteration with no normal detection recordings after 45 mg; 3) Late slowing down of conduction speeds (normal in 50% of cases up to 55-60 mg). Improvement or even complete recovery of neuropathy was documented following reduction of the unit dose, increased time interval between doses, or discontinuation of the treatment. The drug had to be withheld in only three patients: in two cases a low dosage related to individual sensitivity was being used.
The toxic effects of mercury are known to be complex with specific enzyme inhibitions and subsequent oxidative stress adding to the damaging effects. There are likely other factors involved, such as the development of impaired metal ion homeostasis and depletion of thiol and selenium based metabolites such as cysteine and selenium. Much of the toxicity of mercury occurs at the intracellular level via binding of Hg(2+) to thiol groups in specific proteins. Therefore, amelioration of mercury toxicity by the use of chelation would likely be enhanced by the use of a chelator that could cross the cell membrane and the blood brain barrier. It would be most favorable if this compound was of low toxicity, had appropriate pharmacokinetics, bound and rendered mercury cation non-toxic and had antioxidant properties. Herein we report on such a chelator, N,N'-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide (NBMI), and, using an animal model, show that it prevented the toxic effects associated with acute exposure induced by injected mercury chloride.
Endralazine and hydralazine were compared in a randomized double-blind, parallel group study lasting 1 year in 30 patients with essential hypertension inadequately controlled by a beta-blocker and a diuretic. Dosage ranged from 10 mg to 30 mg endralazine per day and from 75 mg to 200 mg hydralazine per day according to patient response. The results showed that endralazine was at least as effective as hydralazine in reducing blood pressure. Patients' tolerance, assessed by drop-out rate, was significantly better (p less than 0.05) in the endralazine group. No cases were found of drug-induced lupus-like syndrome on endralazine as opposed to 2 cases with hydralazine. The dose of endralazine required much less adjustment than that of hydralazine.
Endothelin (ET)-1 is a potent inducer of peptic ulcers. The roles of ET-1 in ulcer healing, however, have remained unclear, and these were investigated in mice. Gastric ulcers were induced in mice by serosal application of acetic acid. Three days later, mice were given a neutralizing ET-1 antibody or nonimmunized serum. The ulcer size, amount of fibrosis and myofibroblasts, and localization of ET-1 and ET(A/B) receptors were analyzed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of ET-1, we examined the proliferation, migration, and release of growth and angiogenic factors in gastric myofibroblasts with or without ET-1. The expression of prepro-ET-1 (an ET-1 precursor) and ET-converting enzyme-1 was examined in gastric myofibroblasts using RT-PCR. Immunoneutralization of ET-1 delayed gastric ulcer healing. The areas of fibrosis and myofibroblasts were smaller in the anti-ET-1 antibody group than in the control. ET-1 was expressed in the gastric epithelium, myofibroblasts, and other cell types. ET(A) receptors, but not ET(B) receptors, were present in myofibroblasts. ET-1 increased proliferation and migration of gastric myofibroblasts. ET-1 stimulated the release of hepatocyte growth factor, VEGF, PGE(2), and IL-6 from gastric myofibroblasts. mRNA for prepro-ET-1 and ET-converting enzyme-1 was also expressed. ET-1 promotes the accumulation of gastric myofibroblasts and collagen fibrils at gastric ulcers. ET-1 also stimulates migration and proliferation of gastric myofibroblasts and enhances the release of growth factors, angiogenic factors, and PGE(2). Thus ET-1 has important roles not only in ulcer formation but also in ulcer healing via mobilizing myofibroblasts and inducing production of stroma-derived factors.
Whereas most inbred mouse strains mount a protective Th1 helper T-cell response following infection with Leishmania major, an ineffective Th2 response develops in BALB/c mice, leading to the development of disseminated, ultimately fatal disease. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) production is required for the initiation of the Th2 response, though little is known about the requirements for the long-term maintenance of this response. In order to investigate the role of the expanding parasite population on the Th2 response, mice infected for 2 weeks with L. major, which exhibited a Th2-like cytokine profile, were treated with a leishmanicidal agent (Pentostam) and/or various doses of anti-IL-4 antibody. Untreated mice, mice treated with Pentostam alone, or mice treated with 2.5 mg of anti-IL-4 antibody given at days 13 and 21 of infection developed progressive disease. However, in 8 of 10 mice treated with this dose of anti-IL-4 antibody plus Pentostam lesion development was arrested and lesions were either controlled or eventually healed. Healing was associated with the production of high levels of gamma interferon by spleen cells, and low levels of immunoglobulin E in serum compared with levels for control animals, indicating that a Th1-like response had developed in mice receiving both treatments. Thus, depletion of IL-4 only in combination with a reduction in the parasite burden allowed the expression of a Th1 response. When the dose of anti-IL-4 antibody was increased to 5 mg per injection, all mice treated with this dose of antibody, with or without Pentostam therapy, healed. However, combined therapy with Pentostam in mice treated with this dose of antibody had an additional protective effect. As expected, a Th1 response developed in mice treated with this dose of anti-IL-4 antibody with or without combined therapy with Pentostam, whereas a Th2 response developed in control mice. Thus, a significant effect on the course of disease is noted when mice with established L. major infections are treated with anti-IL-4 antibody in combination with Pentostam, suggesting that the combined effect of inhibiting IL-4 and reducing the parasite burden has a dramatic effect on the development of resistance to L. major.
Serum thymic factor (FTS), a thymic peptide hormone, has been reported to attenuate the bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury and also experimental pancreatitis and diabetes. In the present study, we investigated the effect of FTS on cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (cisplatin)-induced nephrotoxicity. We have already demonstrated that cephaloridine, a nephrotoxic antibiotic, leads to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation in the rat kidney, which probably contributes to cephaloridine-induced renal dysfunction. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of cisplatin on ERK activation in the rat kidney and also the effect of FTS on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. In vitro treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with FTS significantly ameliorated cisplatin-induced cell injury. Treatment of rats with intravenous cisplatin for 3 days markedly induced renal dysfunction and increased platinum contents in the kidney cortex. An increase in pERK was detected in the nuclear fraction prepared from the rat kidney cortex from days 1 to 3 after injection of cisplatin. FTS suppressed cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction and ERK activation in the kidney. FTS did not influence any Pt contents in the kidney after cisplatin administration. FTS has been shown to enhance the in vivo expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in the kidney cortex. The beneficial role of FTS against cisplatin nephrotoxicity may be mediated in part by HSP70, as suggested by its up-regulation in the kidney cortex treated with FTS alone. Our results suggest that FTS participates in protection from cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by suppressing ERK activation caused by cisplatin.
