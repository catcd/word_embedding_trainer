The SHEAF study (Self measurement of blood pressure at Home in the Elderly: Assessment and Follow-up) is a 3-year prospective cohort study of French elderly (> or =60 years) hypertensive patients designed to assess whether home blood pressure (HBP) measurement provides additional prognostic information over office blood pressure (OBP) in terms of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The objective of the present work is to describe the baseline data of the population enrolled in the SHEAF study with special emphasis on blood pressure control in treated hypertensives.
During the 2-week initial inclusion phase, baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, antihypertensive treatments as well as office and home blood pressure were recorded. Baseline OBP was assessed using a mercury sphygmomanometer (three consecutive measurements during two visits performed 2 weeks apart). HBP was performed over a 4-day period (three consecutive measurements in the morning and in the evening).
A total of 4939 (95%) of the 5211 patients included in the SHEAF study were treated with at least one antihypertensive drug. Their ages ranged from 60 to 99 years (mean age 70 +/- 7 years); 49% were men, 12% had a previous history of coronary artery disease, 14% diabetes and 43% a treated dyslipidaemia. A total of 45% of the treated patients received a single antihypertensive drug, 34% two drugs, 21% three drugs or more. Overall 23% of treated hypertensives were normalised at the doctor's office (systolic BP <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP <90 mm Hg) and 27% at home (home systolic BP <135 mm Hg and home diastolic BP <85 mm Hg). Poor blood pressure control was associated with age, an increasing presence of diabetes and prescription of several antihypertensives. The proportion of subjects with controlled blood pressure decrease with age from 26% (60-69 years) to 21% (> or =80 years). Blood pressure control of diabetic patients was particularly poor as only 19% had an OBP <140/90 mm Hg and 6% a blood pressure <130/85 mm Hg. The percentage of patients with controlled OBP decreased from 26% when receiving a single antihypertensive drug to 11% when receiving four antihypertensives or more.
In the SHEAF study, less than one-third of the patients had an OBP adequately controlled thus confirming previous studies performed in younger populations. Presence of associated cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes did not give rise to a better blood pressure control. When blood pressure control was assessed using HBP measurement similar results were found. As the beneficial effect of antihypertensive treatment has been particularly well established in the elderly, the data of this study underlines the need for a closer and more rigorous management of elderly hypertensives.
The present study investigated whether an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (atipamezole) can influence hyperactivity induced by the systemic administration of scopolamine. In the water maze (WM) task, scopolamine (scop) 0.25 mg/kg treatment significantly increased swimming speed during the acquisition phase of this task. Atipamezole (ati) 30 micrograms/kg slightly reduced swimming speed both in saline- and in scop-treated rats. Ati 300 micrograms/kg slightly reduced swimming speed in saline-treated rats, and it prevented the scop-induced increase in swimming speed, because ati300-scop treated rats swam more slowly than the saline-saline group. In addition, ati 300 micrograms/kg reduced the total distance swum in scop-treated rats during a free swim trial (the platform was removed from the pool) performed 1 day after the acquisition phase of the WM test, even though it did not affect this parameter when administered alone. In the open arena task, which assessed the ambulation of rats when the pool was covered with a solid floor, scopolamine dose-dependently increased locomotor activity. The rats ambulated more when treated with scop 0.50 mg/kg compared to vehicle treatment, whereas the effect of scop 0.25 mg/kg treatment did not reach significance. In a test investigating the effects of ati 300 micrograms/kg and scop 0.50 mg/kg given singly or combined, the rats ambulated more during both ati 300 micrograms/kg and scop 0.50 mg/kg treatments given alone, but when combined, the rats ambulated less than during scop-saline treatment even though this was more than during control (saline-saline) treatment. These results indicate that the systemic administration of an alpha 2-antagonist can reduce hyperactivity induced by scopolamine.
We describe the case of an 83-year-old man with a family history of pulmonary hypertension (PH) who presented with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and later tested positive for a novel bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) gene mutation. To our knowledge, this may be the oldest reported patient with PAH in whom a BMPR2 mutation was initially identified.
We report a case of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode. There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier. The patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism.
In a 70-year-old patient with sotalol-induced torsade de pointes, QT-dispersion in the 12-lead surface ECG was determined in an attempt to evaluate the role of this method in determining risk factors for the development of proarrhythmic effects. After recovery from torsade, the patient was successfully treated with amiodarone over a 3-month follow-up period. Whereas the degree of QT prolongation was comparable during amiodarone therapy to that observed with sotalol, QT dispersion was markedly less (47 ms) than during previous treatment with sotalol (77 ms). During drug-free control, QT dispersion was 43 ms. This case-report indicates that determination of QT dispersion can provide information with respect to identification of patients prone to class III antiarrhythmic drug-induced proarrhythmic effects.
Endogenous copper can play an important role in postischemic reperfusion injury, a condition associated with endothelial cell activation and increased interleukin 8 (IL-8) production. Excessive endothelial IL-8 secreted during trauma, major surgery, and sepsis may contribute to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure (MOF). No previous reports have indicated that copper has a direct role in stimulating human endothelial IL-8 secretion. Increased IL-8 in the culture medium of human umbilical vein (HUVEC), lung microvascular, and iliac artery endothelial cells was observed 24 h after the addition of 10 to 50 microM CuCl2 (cupric ions). HUVEC IL-8 induction by copper was higher than by 50 pg/mL tumor necrosis factor-alpha, whereas 50 pg/mL IL-1beta and 1 ng/mL platelet-activating factor did not stimulate IL-8 production or release. HUVEC IL-8 mRNA increased 3 h after CuCl2 stimulation and remained elevated after 24 h, implying sustained transcriptional activation. Copper did not stimulate HUVECs to secrete other cytokines. Cu(II) appeared to be the primary copper ion responsible for the observed increase in IL-8 because a specific high-affinity Cu(II)-binding peptide, d-Asp-d-Ala-d-His-d-Lys (d-DAHK), completely abolished this effect in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that Cu(II) may induce endothelial IL-8 by a mechanism independent of known Cu(I) generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, in vivo studies are warranted to determine if copper is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammation and if Cu(II) chelation can reduce this IL-8-induced endothelial inflammatory response.
The pathophysiology of spontaneous abortion is complex and may involve the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. We evaluated the predictors of spontaneous abortion in Brazilian pregnant women. The effects of age, gestational age, body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, alcohol ingestion, use of multivitamins and concentrations of vitamins (folate, cobalamin and vitamin B6) and vitamin-dependent metabolites were analyzed.
Study population included 100 healthy women that attended pre-natal care in 2 health centers of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and in whom pregnancy outcome was known. Folate and cobalamin status was measured in blood specimens collected between 4 and 16 weeks. The genotypes for 8 gene polymorphisms were evaluated by PCR-RFLP.
Eighty-eight women had normal pregnancy outcome (Group 1), while 12 experienced a miscarriage after blood collection (Group 2). Increased methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations were found in Group 2 (median [25th-75th percentile]=274 [149-425] nmol/l) relative to Group 1 (138 [98-185]) (P<0.01). No differences between the groups were observed for serum cobalamin, serum or red cell folate, and serum total homocysteine or allele frequencies for 8 polymorphisms. In a conditional logistic regression analysis including age, gestational age, serum creatinine, MMA, cystathionine, body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, alcohol ingestion and use of multivitamins the risk of abortion was significantly associated with MMA (OR [95% CI]=3.80 [1.36, 10.62] per quartile increase in MMA), BMI (OR [95% CI]=5.49 [1.29, 23.39] per quartile) and gestational age (OR [95% CI]=0.10 [0.01, 0.77] per increase of interval in gestational age).
Increased serum MMA and BMI concentrations are associated with spontaneous abortion in Brazilian women.
Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are a common presentation of coronary artery disease, accounting for more than one million hospital admissions in the US annually. Owing to high rates of mortality and reinfarction, ACS represent a major public health concern. The following review discusses the pathogenesis of ACS and optimal approaches for the management of patients with ACS, with special focus on new antithrombotic strategies, including the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin. Bivalirudin has several notable mechanistic advantages compared with unfractionated heparin, including activity against clot-bound thrombin, inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet activation, short plasma half-life in patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function (25 minutes), and linear pharmacokinetics less affected by plasma proteins and renal insufficiency. These properties provide a more predictable inhibition of coagulant activity than unfractionated heparin, with less degree of inter-patient variability in anticoagulation response. The findings from the several clinical trials assessing safety and efficacy of bivalirudin are analyzed in detail, including the recent randomized controlled Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial. Based on the results of the ACUITY trial, a newer streamlined strategy for the invasive treatment of moderate- and high-risk patients with ACS is discussed.
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a potent hepatocarcinogen and peroxisome proliferator (PP) in rodents. Humans are not susceptible to peroxisome proliferation and are considered refractory to carcinogenesis by PPs. Previous studies with rainbow trout indicate they are also insensitive to peroxisome proliferation by the PP dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), but are still susceptible to enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis after chronic exposure.
In this study, we used trout as a unique in vivo tumor model to study the potential for PFOA carcinogenesis in the absence of peroxisome proliferation compared with the structurally diverse PPs clofibrate (CLOF) and DHEA. Mechanisms of carcinogenesis were identified from hepatic gene expression profiles phenotypically anchored to tumor outcome.
We fed aflatoxin B(1) or sham-initiated animals 200-1,800 ppm PFOA in the diet for 30 weeks for tumor analysis. We subsequently examined gene expression by cDNA array in animals fed PFOA, DHEA, CLOF, or 5 ppm 17beta-estradiol (E(2), a known tumor promoter) in the diet for 14 days.
PFOA (1,800 ppm or 50 mg/kg/day) and DHEA treatments resulted in enhanced liver tumor incidence and multiplicity (p < 0.0001), whereas CLOF showed no effect. Carcinogenesis was independent of peroxisome proliferation, measured by lack of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and catalase activity. Alternately, both tumor promoters, PFOA and DHEA, resulted in estrogenic gene signatures with strong correlation to E(2) by Pearson correlation (R = 0.81 and 0.78, respectively), whereas CLOF regulated no genes in common with E(2).
These data suggest that the tumor-promoting activities of PFOA in trout are due to novel mechanisms involving estrogenic signaling and are independent of peroxisome proliferation.
Nuclear hormone receptors are thought to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression in the hippocampus. We report here the isolation of an additional member of this superfamily, HZF-3, which is expressed preferentially in the rat brain and therein within the hippocampus. HZF-3 cDNA encodes a 66.6-kDa protein with high homology to the inducible nuclear orphan receptors NURR1/NOT and NGFI-B. Like NURR1/NOT and NGFI-B, HZF-3 mRNA accumulates in PC12 cells subsequent to membrane depolarization. In the rat brain, HZF-3 expression is induced following seizures elicited by the chlorinated insecticide lindane. The time course of HZF-3 induction by membrane depolarization in PC12 cells and seizures in animals is more prolonged than that observed for other immediate-early genes, such as NGFI-B. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated HZF-3 to interact specifically with the same DNA target element as NGFI-B: NBRE. These results suggest HZF-3 is a member of a distinct family of inducible orphan receptors which are likely to display synergistic and/or antagonistic regulatory functions in mediating signal-induced transcriptional responses in the nervous system.
Preoperative oral treatment with lactulose is used to prevent complications after surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice. The effect is perhaps the result of an inactivation of gut derived endotoxins but the exact mechanism of action is, however, unknown. Tumour necrosis factor is an important mediator of endotoxin toxicity. The cytokine tumour necrosis factor is mainly produced by mononuclear phagocytes. In this study, the effect of lactulose on the endotoxin induced tumour necrosis factor release by monocytes was investigated. The direct effect of lactulose on endotoxin was tested in a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Polymyxin B a known inactivator of endotoxin was used as control in both experiments. Lactulose has a limited capacity to inactivate endotoxin as measured in the endotoxin assay. In contrast lactulose significantly reduced endotoxin induced tumour necrosis factor production by monocytes. In conclusion lactulose inhibits tumour necrosis factor production by a direct inhibitory effect on monocytes, rather than by inactivation of endotoxin. Because tumour necrosis factor is an important mediator of endotoxin toxicity, this inhibitory effect could explain the beneficial effect of lactulose in obstructive jaundice.
This experiment examines the effect of access to a running-wheel on intravenous cocaine self-administration in male and female rats. Rats maintained at 85% of their free-feeding body weight were first exposed to the running-wheel alone during the 6-h sessions until behavior stabilized for 14 days. Intravenous cannulae were then implanted, and the rats were trained to self-administer a low dose of cocaine (0.2 mg/kg) under a fixed-ratio (FR 1) schedule during the 6-h sessions, while the wheel remained inactive and cocaine self-administration stabilized (cocaine-only condition). Next, the wheel access and cocaine self-administration were concurrently available followed by a period of cocaine-only. Behavior was allowed to stabilize for 10 days at each phase. During wheel access, cocaine infusions decreased by 21.9% in males and 70.6% in females compared to the cocaine-only condition; the effect was statistically significant in females. Infusions increased to baseline levels when wheel access was terminated. When cocaine infusions were concurrently available, wheel revolutions were reduced by 63.7% and 61.5% in males and females, respectively, compared to the wheel-only condition. This result did not differ due to sex, but it was statistically significant when data from males and females were combined. These results indicate that wheel-running activity had a greater suppressant effect on cocaine self-administration in females than in males, and in females, wheel-running and cocaine self-administration are substitutable as reinforcers.
A new rat model for multifocal cerebral thrombosis has recently been reported (Tani et al., 1994; 1995). Ultrastructural changes in the cerebral neocortex in the acute phase were investigated in order to characterize the early pathological events in this model. A bolus injection of alkaline phenytoin solution (pH 10.8) into one internal carotid artery in the rat caused severe endothelial injury accompanied by thrombosis in the cerebral vasculature within 5 minutes, and severe oedema of the ipsilateral hemisphere within an hour. Cerebral water content was measured by the simple dry-wet method, and cerebral surface area and the surface area and volume of the ischaemic zone were measured using computer-aided image analysis. Good correlations were demonstrated between cerebral water content and cerebral surface area, and between the surface area and volume of the ischaemic zone. We report here that quantitative evaluation of acute cerebral damage induced by phenytoin solution is possible with high reliability using simple image analysis.
High-dose cisplatin regimens have been shown to be highly active in advanced melanoma patients but are associated with unacceptable side effects. In order to increase the platinum dose but avoid severe side effects, we treated 15 dacarbazine (DTIC)-resistant metastatic melanoma patients with a combination regimen of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) and carboplatin (200 mg/m2), two platinum analogues with a similar mode of action but a different toxicity pattern. After a mean follow-up period of 10.7 months (range 4-18 months), two patients (13.3%) achieved complete remission and two patients (13.3%) showed partial remission, giving an overall response rate of 26.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2-49%). Furthermore, three patients (20%; 95% CI 0-40.2%) experienced stable disease. The median duration of response was 7.1 months (95% CI 4.2-10.0 months), and the median overall survival was 12.5 months (95% CI 5.8-19.2 months), with eight patients still alive. The main side effects were haematological (leukopenia/thrombocytopenia World Health Organization [WHO] grade I-IV; anaemia WHO grade I-III), gastrointestinal (WHO grade I-III), neurological (WHO grade I-II) and renal (WHO grade I) toxicity. Nevertheless, except in one patient, side effects did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Despite the small number of patients treated in this preliminary study, we believe that combining cisplatin and carboplatin represents a novel, active and well-tolerated therapeutic option as second-line chemotherapy in DTIC-resistant advanced melanoma patients.
The present study examined the effect of the highly potent and selective MAO B inhibitor PF9601N on L-DOPA-induced rotational behavior in unilateral nigrostriatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats. Three doses of PF9601N (20, 40 and 60mg/kg) were administered 30 min before an injection of L-DOPA (25mg/kg), and both contralateral and ipsilateral rotational behavior was measured. In addition, we also studied the effect produced by another MAO B inhibitor, deprenyl (20mg/kg), the MAO A inhibitor, clorgyline (20mg/kg), and the dopamine reuptake inhibitor, GBR2909 (7.5 mg/kg) on L-DOPA-induced rotational behavior. The results showed that PF9601N plus L-DOPA significantly enhanced the duration of contralateral rotational behavior with respect to L-DOPA plus vehicle in a dose-related manner. At the dose of 40 and 60mg/kg, PF9601N produced significantly more overall contralateral turning than L-DOPA plus vehicle, and at the dose of 60mg/kg, PF9601N produced significantly more turning behavior than L-DOPA plus deprenyl. These results suggest that PF9601N may be used as a novel tool in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Stent thrombosis is potentially lethal complication with huge economic burden. The role of insufficient response to antiplatelet therapy is still unclear reason for its occurrence.
We presented 54-year-old man with recurrent stent thrombosis on the 4th, 9th and 12th day after the primary percutaneous coronary intervention in spite of double antiaggregation therapy (aspirin+clopidogrel). All possible procedural causes were excluded and reimplantation of intracoronary stent was insufficient to resolve the problem, so four platelet tests were performed: flow cytometry, Platelet Function Analyzer-100 test, aggregometry, and determination of gene polymorphism for P2Y12 receptor (directly involved in the mechanism of thienopyridine), and GPIIbIIIa receptor (final receptor in aggregation). The patient was the carrier of the major haplotype H1H1 for P2Y12 receptor and minor A1A2 for GPIIbIIIa receptor. The results of all the performed tests showed insufficient antiplatelet effect of aspirin and sufficient response to thienopyridin (not to clopidogrel, but to ticlopidine).
Performance of platelet function tests is necessary in the case of major adverse cardiac events especially stent thrombosis, after implantation of intracoronary stent.
We studied the effect of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists on colonic function stimulated by water-avoidance stress, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), bethanechol and castor oil by comparison with the effects of atropine and a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, ondansetron. Yohimbine, idazoxan and atropine, but not ondansetron, significantly inhibited water-avoidance stress-stimulated faecal excretion. Yohimbine and idazoxan inhibited neither 5-HT- nor bethanechol-stimulated faecal excretion. In contrast, atropine inhibited both 5-HT- and bethanechol-stimulated faecal excretion and ondansetron inhibited 5-HT-stimulated faecal excretion. Yohimbine did not inhibit the incidence of diarrhoea induced by castor oil, but idazoxan significantly inhibited diarrhoea observed during a 1-h period after the administration of castor oil. Both atropine and ondansetron inhibited diarrhoea during a 2-h period after the administration of castor oil. These findings suggest that alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists specifically inhibit colonic motor function stimulated by stress in rats.
The abuse of cocaine has dramatically increased in the recent decade. Cocaine obtained on the illegal market is rarely found in pure form. Most often it is adulterated with various substances, especially other local anesthetics. Lidocaine is one of the most common local anesthetics employed for adulteration of illicit cocaine. Toxicity due to the simultaneous ingestion of cocaine and lidocaine has been reported. Acute toxicity to cocaine and other local anesthetics is manifested in central nervous system aberrations, such as seizures and convulsions. This study investigated the convulsant potency of cocaine and lidocaine alone and in combination. Rats were administered intravenous injections of 5 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of cocaine or lidocaine alone and in combination in equal proportion. Seizure activity and intensity were evaluated. The plasma concentration and brain content of each agent was also determined at the time of toxicity. The administration of 5 mg/kg of each drug alone did not yield seizure activity. However, the concomitant administration of 5 mg/kg of both cocaine and lidocaine produced a seizure response nearly equal to that produced after administration of 20 mg/kg of cocaine alone. Diazepam pre-treatment successfully antagonized the seizures induced by cocaine and lidocaine and raised the seizure threshold dose for the combination treatment by approximately four fold. The results suggest that cocaine and lidocaine interact synergistically to increase seizure activity and that the nature of this response occurs in part through a depression of inhibitory neuronal transmission.
The purpose of this double-blind, randomised trial with a 4-week placebo run-in period followed by an active treatment period using either spirapril 3 mg or 6 mg once a day was to clarify the existence of hypotensive episodes in elderly hypertensive patients treated by an ACE-inhibitor. Forty hypertensive patients aged 60-76 years underwent 24-h ABPM at the end of the run-in (week 4) and active treatment (week 9) periods. The mean 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 161.9 (26.7) mm Hg to 150.6 (29.9) mm Hg (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 91.70 (14.7) mm Hg to 84.2 (17.3) mm Hg (P < 0.001). No episodes of mean arterial pressure (MAP) <50 mm Hg were seen during the placebo period. Instead 11 episodes were observed during the antihypertensive treatment (one in the 3 mg group and 10 in the 6 mg group, P < 0.01 between the two treatment groups). Fifty-four episodes of MAP <70 mm Hg were observed during the placebo period and 117 during the treatment period (P < 0.001). During the placebo period low MAPs were observed only during night time. During the treatment period they were seen also from 11 am to 4 pm. In conclusion, ACE-inhibitor therapy with spirapril significantly increased hypotensive episodes in elderly hypertensive patients which may worsen their cerebral and myocardial circulation.
The effects of hyperdynamic therapy with colloidal volume expansion and pharmacological augmentation of cardiac function with dobutamine on local cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the size of ischemic injury were investigated in rats subjected to 6 h of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. At 45 min after MCA occlusion, each rat was randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: (1) control; (2) hetastarch infusion (HES); and (3) hetastarch plus dobutamine (12 micrograms/kg/min) infusion (HES/DOB). In both the HES and HES/DOB groups, cardiac output and local CBF in ischemic brain markedly increased after treatment and infarction volumes were significantly reduced as compared to the control group. There were, however, no significant differences between both groups apart from a dobutamine-induced tachycardia. Colloidal volume expansion augmented cardiac output, increased CBF in ischemic brain, and substantially modified the extent of ischemic injury. However, the addition of dobutamine did not bring about adjunctive beneficial effects of cardiac performance, CBF, or the degree of ischemic brain damage in the rat focal ischemic model.
The aim of this study was to characterise the arrhythmogenic mechanisms involved in hypokalaemia-induced sustained ventricular fibrillation (SVF), in hypertensive rats. The hearts from rats with hypertension induced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, and age-matched normotensive controls, were perfused in Langendorff mode with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution followed by a K(+)-deficient solution. In additional experiments, free intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was measured using fura-2 in conjunction with an epicardial optical probe. The epicardial electrocardiogram was continuously monitored during all experiments. The gap junction protein connexin-43 and the ultrastructure of the cardiomyocytes were examined, and selected enzyme activities were measured in situ. There was a higher incidence of low-K(+)-induced SVF in the hearts of hypertensive compared to normotensive rats (83 % vs. 33 %, P < 0.05). Perfusion with a low-K(+)-containing solution lead to elevation of diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) that was accompanied by premature beats, bigeminy, ventricular tachycardia and transient ventricular fibrillation. These events occurred earlier with increased incidence and duration in the hearts of hypertensive rats (arrhythmia scores: hypertensive, 4.9 +/- 0.7; normotensive, 3.1 +/- 0.1; P < 0.05), which exhibited apparent remodelling accompanied by a significant decrease in the density of connexin-43-positive gap junctions. Moreover, low-K(+)-related myocardial changes, including local impairment of intermyocyte junctions, ultrastructural alterations due to Ca(2+) overload and intercellular uncoupling, and decreased enzyme activities were more pronounced and more dispersed in hypertensive than normotensive rats. In conclusion, nitric oxide-deficient hypertension is associated with decreased myocardial coupling at gap junctions. The further localised deterioration of junctional coupling, due to low-K(+)-induced Ca(2+) disturbances, as well as spatial heterogeneity of myocardial alterations including interstitial fibrosis, probably provide the mechanisms for re-entry and sustaining ventricular fibrillation.
A 3-year-old boy with nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma with a four-month history of scabies was treated with a single dose of lindane cream. In a 48-hour period, he developed nausea and vomiting and also suffered from an epileptiform convulsion and muscular spasms. Seventy-two hours after application of the cream, his blood lindane level was 54 ng/mL. Caution should be exercised when using lindane in patients with compromised epidermal barrier function.
Two cases of pituitary apoplexy occurring in the course of long-term bromocriptine therapy for active acromegaly are described. Although bromocriptine was effective in lowering serum growth hormone levels and concomitant clinical improvement was achieved, both patients developed an acute episode suggesting pituitary apoplexy when the therapy was continued for 6 and 24 months, respectively. Surgery verified marked haemorrhage and necrosis of an eosinophilic pituitary adenoma in each case. Bromocriptine may have suppressed the growth of these pituitary adenomas resulting in necrosis of the tumour, followed by haemorrhage into the adenoma. Pituitary apoplexy has not been documented as a complication of bromocriptine therapy. This report points out a possible role of bromocriptine in the development of this catastrophe and that careful follow-up is required when long-term treatment with bromocriptine is attempted.
