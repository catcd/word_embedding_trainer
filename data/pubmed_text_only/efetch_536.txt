Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that are related to retinoid, steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. The PPAR-gamma receptor subtype appears to play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and inflammation. The thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone (Avandia) is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of rosiglitazone in animal models of acute inflammation (carrageenan-induced paw oedema and carrageenan-induced pleurisy). We report here for the first time that rosiglitazone (given at 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg i.p. concomitantly with carrageenan injection in the paw oedema model, or at 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg i.p. 15 min before carrageenan administration in the pleurisy model) exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects (e.g. inhibition of paw oedema, pleural exudate formation, mononuclear cell infiltration and histological injury) in vivo. Furthermore, rosiglitazone reduced: (1) the increase in the staining (immunohistochemistry) for nitrotyrosine and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), (2) the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), intercellular adhesion molecules-1 (ICAM-1) and P-selectin in the lungs of carrageenan-treated rats. In order to elucidate whether the protective effect of rosiglitazone is related to activation of the PPAR-gamma receptor, we also investigated the effect of a PPAR-gamma antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), on the protective effects of rosiglitazone. BADGE (30 mg/kg i.p.) administered 30 min prior to treatment with rosiglitazone significantly antagonized the effect of the PPAR-gamma agonist and thus abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of rosiglitazone. We propose that rosiglitazone and other potent PPAR-gamma agonists may be useful in the therapy of inflammation.
Ventricular extrastimulation was performed in 11 patients evaluated for chronic recurrent ventricular tachycardia, before and after a 1-gm procainamide infusion. Extrastimulation caused only nonsustained extra beats (less than 4) in 3 patients. Sustained tachycardia was induced in 7 patients in the basal state, of which 6 continued to have inducible tachycardia after procainamide was given (5.2 to 9.8 mg/L). The zone of coupling intervals that initiated tachycardia was unchanged or widened in these 6 patients because ventricular refractoriness was unchanged or because the tachycardia zone shifted to later diastole by an interval at least equivalent to the prolongation of ventricular refractoriness. Post-procainamide tachycardia cycle length was prolonged in all patients, by an average 51 msec. The one patient who responded to procainamide had a shortened ventricular refractory period, but the greatest slowing of tachycardia. Finally, sustained ventricular tachycardia could be induced in the eleventh patient only following procainamide administration, consistent with his clinical history. These results suggest that procainamide often may be ineffective in preventing sustained ventricular tachycardia, and that slowed conduction, rather than prolonged refractoriness, is the basis for the procainamide antiarrhythmic effect. Our data emphasize that antiarrhythmic drug effectiveness be evaluated in terms of effect on sustained arrhythmia rather than suppression of isolated ectopic beats.
The teratogenic potential of valproic acid has been well established both in experimental models and in human clinical studies. As with all human teratogens, there are genetically determined differences in individual susceptibility to the induction of congenital defects. Using a mouse model of valproate-induced neural tube defects, a study was undertaken to examine differential changes in gene expression for selected transcription factor (Pax-3, Emx-1, Emx-2, c-fos, c-jun, creb) and cell cycle checkpoint genes (bcl-2, p53, wee-1) during neural tube closure. In general, exposure to teratogenic concentrations of valproic acid elicited GD 9:12 control levels of transcription factor mRNA expression in GD 9:0 embryos of both strains. This accelerated developmental profile is marked by significant elevation of Emx-1, Emx-2, c-fos, c-jun, and creb expression. There was also a significant over expression of the cell cycle genes p53 and bcl-2 in the LM/Bc embryos in response to the teratogenic insult. Examination of the ratio of expression of these genes clearly favored bcl-2, which supports the hypothesis that altered neuroepithelial cell proliferation rates, rather than increased apoptosis, is the underlying mechanism by which valproic acid alters normal neural tube morphogenesis. An investigation into interactive effects of these genes on the molecular profile of GD 9:0 embryos further validated this observation. That is, the overall proliferative state among the control embryos was prematurely modified into a more differentiated state following teratogenic insult. These results suggest that alterations in the expression of multiple genes are most likely responsible for valproic acid-induced neural tube defects.
Identification of allergenic chemicals is an important occupational safety issue. While several methods exist to identify contact sensitizers, there is currently no validated model to predict the potential of chemicals to act as respiratory sensitizers. Previously, we reported that cytometry analysis of the local immune responses induced in mice dermally exposed to the respiratory sensitizer trimellitic anhydride (TMA 10%) and contact sensitizer dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB 1%) could identify divergent expression of several immune parameters. The present study confirms, first, that IgE-positive B cells, MHC class II molecules, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-4Rα can differentiate the allergic reactions caused by high doses of strong respiratory (TMA, phthalic anhydride and toluene diisocyanate) and contact sensitizers (DNCB, dinitrofluorobenzene and oxazolone). The second part of the study was designed to test the robustness of these markers when classing the weakly immunogenic chemicals most often encountered. Six respiratory allergens, including TMA (2.5%), five contact allergens, including DNCB (0.25%), and two irritants were compared at doses of equivalent immunogenicity. The results indicated that IL-4Rα and IL-2 can be reliably used to discriminate sensitizers. Respiratory sensitizers induced markedly higher IL-4Rα levels than contact allergens, while irritants had no effect on this parameter. Inversely, contact allergens tended to induce higher percentages of IL-2⁺CD8⁺ cells than respiratory allergens. In contrast, the markers MHC-II, IgE and IL-4 were not able to classify chemicals with low immunogenic potential. In conclusion, IL-4Rα and IL-2 have the potential to be used in classifying a variety of chemical allergens.
To investigate whether the high mortality rate that occurs in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is related to abnormalities in glycemic control, in hemodynamics and cardiac function, or in susceptibility to the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias.
Diabetes was induced in SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats by the intravenous injection of STZ 55 mg/kg. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed after six and 11 weeks. Blood pressure was measured in conscious rats at weeks 0 and 11 with a tail-cuff method and in anesthetized animals at week 12 through a cannulated artery. Response of myocardial function to rapid intravenous infusion of saline 10 mL/kg/min and the times of onset of ventricular arrhythmias during intravenous infusion of aconitine 20 micrograms/kg/min were determined in anesthetized rats at week 12. Plasma samples from the rats were assayed for glucose, insulin, triglycerides and carnitine.
STZ injection caused hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia and glucose intolerance equally in SHR and WKY. Diabetic SHR exhibited significant hypertriglyceridemia, depletion in plasma carnitine, impaired responses of blood pressure and myocardial function to rapid intravenous infusion of saline and a 37.5% mortality rate, whereas diabetic WKY did not exhibit these changes. SHR and WKY, diabetic or nondiabetic, were equally sensitive to the induction of ventricular arrhythmias by aconitine infusion.
Mortality of the STZ-diabetic SHR is not due to an exaggeration of the impaired glycemic control, but may be attributed to the occurrence of cardiac dysfunction. The development of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, while unlikely, cannot be completely excluded.
The effect of the intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of taurine on amnesia, convulsions and death caused by hypoxia was investigated in mice. Taurine in doses of 80-100 micrograms/mouse impaired acquisition of a single trial in passive avoidance performance, but protected mice from the learning impairment induced by hypoxia. Neither beta-alanine nor saccharose were able to mimic the effects of taurine. Taurine had no effect on amnesia induced by scopolamine injected intraperitoneally. Taurine protected against the onset of convulsions induced by hypoxia, while convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and hyperbaric oxygen were unaffected. The survival time of mice exposed to hypoxia was significantly increased by taurine treatment. These data suggest that taurine may play a role as an antihypoxic agent.
The morbidity and mortality associated with heparin-induced thrombosis remain high despite numerous empirical therapies. Ancrod has been used successfully for prophylaxis against development of thrombosis in patients with heparin induced platelet aggregation who require brief reexposure to heparin, but its success in patients who have developed the thrombosis syndrome is not well defined. The authors present a case of failure of ancrod treatment in a patient with heparin-induced thrombosis.
Studies performed recently have determined that aldosterone has not only a major role in electrolyte and water balance and K excretion, but it also modulates myofibroblast growth in the heart and blood vessels and causes fibrosis. This study investigated the effects of aldosterone blockers in rats with anti-thy 1.1 nephritis, both on proliferation and fibrosis, by comparing it to an angiotensin receptor inhibitor valsartan. Rats with anti-thy 1.1 nephritis were randomly allocated to one of the three following groups of treatment: the control group (group 1); those treated with the aldosterone receptor blocker spironolactone (group 2); and those treated with the ATRB valsartan (group 3). On day 7, the parameters of glomerular fibrosis [transforming growth factor beta, TGF staining areas %], proliferation (Ki-67), and renal damage scores were determined. The TGF-beta and Ki-67 levels of control group were significantly more than the other two groups (p<0.01). The TGF staining areas percentages were significantly decreased compared to control group. The artery, glomerular, and renal injury scores evaluated between the groups were found to be significantly decreased compared to control group. In line with previous studies, this study found that in anti-thy 1.1 mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, aldosterone blockage affected proliferation and fibrosis.
Visual hallucinations are a well recognized unwanted effect of treatment with levodopa. Although many individual cases have been reported, there has only been one review previously published about this finding, and this did not discriminate age groups. We present five cases and briefly review the literature. It is important to enquire specifically about visual hallucinations in patients on levodopa therapy at follow up, as this otherwise potentially reversible side effect may be overlooked.
Long-term neurotoxicity is a frequent complication of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. Treatment protocols without radiotherapy have been implemented to avoid this; however, little detailed neuropsychologic and neuroradiologic data exist to assess the frequency of long-term treatment sequelae in this patient group.
To determine whether a polychemotherapy regimen based on high-dose methotrexate results in cognitive impairment and/or changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain during long-term follow-up.
Twenty patients with histologically proven primary central nervous system lymphoma were treated with a novel chemotherapy protocol that included systemic and intraventricular administration of methotrexate and cytarabine (ara-C). Standardized neuropsychologic testing and magnetic resonance imaging investigations were performed prior to therapy and prospectively during a median follow-up period of 36 months (range, 21-69 months).
Ten patients achieved durable remissions without relapse for more than 1 year after completion of chemotherapy. There was no gross cognitive decline in any of these patients during the follow-up period. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging revealed therapy-induced white matter changes in 5 of these patients.
We conclude that chemotherapy alone is associated with a low risk of long-term neurotoxicity in primary central nervous system lymphoma. Methotrexate-induced white matter lesions detectable on magnetic resonance imaging are not inevitably associated with significant cognitive decline.
Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive copper transport disorder resulting from defective biliary excretion of copper and subsequent hepatic copper accumulation and liver failure if not treated. The disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B (WND) gene, which is expressed predominantly in the liver and encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that is structurally and functionally similar to the Menkes protein (MNK), which is defective in the X-linked copper transport disorder Menkes disease. The toxic milk (tx) mouse has a clinical phenotype similar to Wilson disease patients and, recently, the tx mutation within the murine WND homologue (WND:) of this mouse was identified, establishing it as an animal model for Wilson disease. In this study, cDNA constructs encoding the wild-type (Wnd-wt) and mutant (Wnd-tx) Wilson proteins (Wnd) were generated and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The tx mutation disrupted the copper-induced relocalization of Wnd in CHO cells and abrogated Wnd-mediated copper resistance of transfected CHO cells. In addition, co-localization experiments demonstrated that while Wnd and MNK are located in the trans-Golgi network in basal copper conditions, with elevated copper, these proteins are sorted to different destinations within the same cell. Ultrastructural studies showed that with elevated copper levels, Wnd accumulated in large multi-vesicular structures resembling late endosomes that may represent a novel compartment for copper transport. The data presented provide further support for a relationship between copper transport activity and the copper-induced relocalization response of mammalian copper ATPases, and an explanation at a molecular level for the observed phenotype of tx mice.
The authors evaluated whether alfentanil could be given before treatment procedures in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates without adverse effects. Alfentanil (mean dose 11.7 micrograms/kg, range 9-15) was given intravenously to 20 mechanically ventilated critically ill newborn infants (mean birth weight 2510 g, range 1490-3990) during the first 3 days of life before treatment procedures. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, transcutaneous partial pressure of O2, respiratory rate, and general activity were observed continuously from 10 min before the administration of alfentanil until 1 h after it. Plasma alfentanil concentrations were measured in 15 subjects. The pharmacokinetics of alfentanil varied greatly among the subjects. The hemodynamic changes were not clinically significant, and the most important side effect was muscle rigidity. Nine infants had mild or moderate rigidity, which had little or no effect on ventilation. Four infants had severe rigidity and jerking comparable to convulsive activity, transiently impairing ventilation and oxygenation for approximately 5-10 min. Increased inspired oxygen and increased pressure by manual ventilation were needed to prevent hypoxemia. Electroencephalographic recordings for three infants during alfentanil administration showed no evidence of increased seizure activity. We conclude that alfentanil should not be used for newborn infants without simultaneous muscle relaxation because of the danger of rigidity.
To investigate the effects of the combination of octreotide and aspirin on the growth of gastric cancer.
Proliferation of gastric cancer cell lines treated with octreotide or aspirin was determined by (3)H-thymidine incorporation. After xenografts of human gastric cancer were implanted orthotopically in the stomach of nude mice, they were administered octreotide plus aspirin for 8 weeks. The mRNA of somatostatin receptor in the tissues of gastric carcinoma was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cyclooxygenase-2 in gastric cancer tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry.
Both octreotide and aspirin significantly reduced the (3)H-thymidine incorporation of gastric cancer cells. Xenografts in situ were found in all stomachs of nude mice except for two in the combination group. Either size or weight of tumors treated by octreotide, aspirin or in combination was significantly reduced as compared with that of controls. The inhibition rate for tumor was 60.6% (octreotide), 39.3% (aspirin), and 85.6% (in combination) respectively. No severe side effects were observed in any treated groups. Somatostatin receptor-2 and -3 were expressed in the transplanted gastric adenocarcinomas. Aspirin could down-regulate the strong expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in the tissue of gastric adenocarcinomas of nude mice.
A combination of octreotide and aspirin significantly inhibited proliferation of gastric cancer through mediation of somatostatin receptors and suppression of cyclooxygenase-2.
The cblE type of homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which manifests with megaloblastic anaemia and developmental delay in early childhood. This disease is caused by a defect in reductive activation of methionine synthase (MTR). Our study was directed at clinical, biochemical, enzymatic and molecular characterization of two Czech patients with the cblE type of homocystinuria. Case 1 involves a 20-year-old mentally retarded patient who presented with megaloblastic anaemia at 10 weeks of age. She was treated with folates and vitamin B12, and subsequent attempts to cease administration of folates led to recurrence of megaloblastic anaemia. Biochemical features included severe hyperhomocysteinaemia and hypomethioninaemia and in fibroblasts defective formation of methionine from formate, and no complementation with cblE cells. Subsequent molecular analysis of the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) gene revealed compound heterozygosity for a transition c.1459G>A (G487R) and a 2bp insertion (c.1623-1624insTA). Case 2 involves an 8-year-old girl with nystagmus and developmental delay in whom megaloblastic anaemia was detected at 11 weeks of age. Severe hyperhomocysteinaemia with normal methionine levels was found and enzymatic and complementation studies confirmed the cblE defect. This patient is homozygous for a 140 bp insertion (c.903-904ins140). The insertion is caused by a T>C transition within intron 6 of the MTRR gene, which presumably leads to activation of an exon splicing enhancer. In the families of both patients, enzymatic and mutation analyses were successfully used for prenatal diagnosis. Our study expands the knowledge of the phenotypic and genotypic variability of the cblE type of homocystinuria and supports the concept that this disorder is caused by mutations in the MTRR gene.
Ingestion of the anticonvulsant drug valproic acid and of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril during pregnancy has been associated with abnormal fetal outcome in humans. In contrast, the use of the antiinflammatory drug ibuprofen and the antihistamine diphenhydramine has not been documented to be embryotoxic in humans. We evaluated the rat embryo culture system as a predictive model of teratogenesis, using these four drugs as test agents. Valproic acid, ibuprofen, and diphenhydramine were embryotoxic, inducing concentration-dependent decreases in growth and a significant increase in anomalies. Valproic acid caused an increase in neural tube defects, ibuprofen increased the incidence of abnormal maxillary processes, and diphenhydramine increased the number of embryos with distorted body morphology. These abnormalities were induced at concentrations of valproic acid and diphenhydramine that are used clinically, but ibuprofen only induced toxicity at concentrations greatly exceeding the therapeutic range. Captopril was not embryotoxic up to 5 mM, the highest concentration tested. These results suggest that the rat embryo culture system produces both false positive and false negative data on the teratogenic potential of drugs. Although such an in vitro assay may be suitable to determine the mechanism of teratogenesis, it is not a sensitive indicator of potential human teratogens on its own. These data support the view that in vitro systems can only supplement clinical and epidemiological observations in humans, possibly as a method to determine mechanisms of actions of teratogens.
Despite reports of an increase in the incidence of simultaneous cocaine and anabolic steroid abuse, potential adverse interactions between these two drugs on the cardiovascular system are largely unquantified. Cocaine has been reported to induce coronary vasoconstriction, cardiac arrhythmias and conduction delays. Anabolic steroids have been associated with cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension. Utilising both in vivo (radiotelemetry) and in vitro (isolated Langendorff-perfused heart) techniques, our aim was to determine whether anabolic steroids cause cardiac hypertrophy and alter cardiac function, and consequently alter the response of the heart to cocaine. It was found that 15 days of treatment of rats with nandrolone decanoate (20 mg/kg, s.c.) was not sufficient to cause hypertrophy, alter cardiac function or the spread of electrical activity through the heart. However, nandrolone pretreatment was found to significantly potentiate the heart rate response to cocaine (45 mg/kg, i.p.) in vivo. This study indicates that nandrolone significantly elevates the heart rate response to high dose cocaine without changing heart morphology. The mechanism of this interaction remains uncertain.
We report a case of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis due to antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies that progressed to end-stage renal disease in a 35-year-old man who used intranasal cocaine on an occasional basis. In contrast to many prior reports of acute renal failure occurring with cocaine-associated rhabdomyolysis, this patient did not have any evidence of acute muscle damage and myoglobin release. Circulating anti-GBM antibodies and renal biopsy with linear IgG and C3 deposits confirmed the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease. The possibility of anti-GBM must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure in cocaine addicts. This unusual combination raises complex questions regarding the pathogenesis of this type of renal injury.
Copper is an essential trace element which forms an integral component of many enzymes. While trace amounts of copper are needed to sustain life, excess copper is extremely toxic. An attempt is made here to present the current understanding of the normal transport of copper in relation to the absorption, intracellular transport and toxicity. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder of copper transport resulting in the accumulation of copper in organs such as liver and brain which leads to progressive hepatic and neurological damage. The gene responsible for Wilson disease (ATP7B) is predicted to encode a putative copper-transporting P-type ATPase. An important feature of this ATPase is the presence of a large N-terminal domain that contains six repeats of a copper-binding motif which is thought to be responsible for binding this metal prior to its transport across the membrane. We have cloned, expressed and purified the N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kD) of Wilson disease ATPase. Metal-binding properties of the domain showed the protein to bind several metals besides copper; however, copper has a higher affinity for the domain. The copper is bound to the domain in Cu(I) form with a copper: protein ratio of 6.5:1. X-ray absorption studies strongly suggest Cu(I) atoms are ligated to cysteine residues. Circular dichroism spectral analyses suggest both secondary and tertiary structural changes upon copper binding to the domain. Copper-binding studies suggest some degree of cooperativity in binding of copper. These studies as well as detailed structural information of the copper-binding domain will be crucial in determining the specific role played by the copper-transporting ATPase in the homeostatic control of copper in the body and how the transport of copper is interrupted by mutations in the ATPase gene.
To evaluate the oxidative state in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy type 1 (FAP1).
From 3 unrelated families, patients with FAP1 carrying a transthyretin Met-30 mutation were studied. The diagnosis was confirmed by genetic analysis. Eleven of 21 patients carried the mutation; all were symptomatic and were clinically assessed using a clinical score. All of the patients were evaluated for copper-zinc superoxide dismutase type 1 activity in red blood cells using spectrophotometry. Plasma total reactive antioxidant potential was studied using a chemiluminescent method. The results were compared with those obtained from an age-matched control group.
A public and academic multidisciplinary research clinic.
Six of the 11 FAP1-positive patients disclosed superoxide dismutase type 1 activity values greater than 55 U/mg of protein (upper control limit), whereas 9 of 10 patients in whom total reactive antioxidant potential was measured had values below the lower limit of the control group. No relationship was found between the levels of superoxide dismutase type 1 activity and the severity of the clinical involvement.
Oxidative stress may be part of the mechanisms leading to tissue damage in patients with FAP1. The lack of correlation between the laboratory findings and the severity of clinical involvement may signal that oxidative processes are at work throughout the natural history of the disease.
Neural stem cells were identified in the rat heart and during scar formation and healing participated in sympathetic fiber sprouting and angiogenesis. In the setting of diabetes, impaired wound healing represents a typical pathological feature. These findings provided the impetus to test the hypothesis that experimental diabetes adversely influenced the phenotype of cardiac neural stem cells. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were associated with elevated plasma glucose levels, significant loss of body weight and left ventricular contractile dysfunction. In the heart of STZ-diabetic rats, the density of nestin immunoreactive processes emanating from cardiac neural stem cells were reduced. The latter finding was reaffirmed as nestin protein expression was significantly decreased in the heart of STZ-diabetic rats and associated with a concomitant reduction of nestin mRNA. Employing the TUNEL assay, the loss of nestin expression in STZ-diabetic rats was not attributed to widespread cardiac neural stem cell apoptosis. Insulin administration to STZ-diabetic rats with established hyperglycaemia led to a modest recovery of nestin protein expression in cardiac neural stem cells. By contrast, the administration of insulin immediately after STZ injection improved plasma glucose levels and significantly attenuated the loss of nestin protein expression. These data highlight the novel observation that nestin protein expression in cardiac neural stem cells was significantly reduced in STZ-induced type I diabetic rats. The aberrant cardiac neural stem cell phenotype may compromise their biological role and predispose the diabetic heart to maladaptive healing following ischemic injury.
A chromosomal translocation t(11;14) (p15;q11) is described in a human acute T-cell leukaemia of immature phenotype (CD3-, CD4-, CD8-). The translocation occurs at a T-cell receptor joining J delta segment, 12 kb upstream of the constant C delta gene and 98 kb upstream of the C alpha gene at chromosome band 14q11. Nucleotide sequencing shows that both J delta and C delta are very conserved between mouse and man. The region of chromosome 11 involved in the translocation is transcriptionally active and produces a 4-kb mRNA. The DNA sequence at the chromosome 11 junction shows a perfect match to a recombinase signal sequence implying that this translocation occurred by recombinase error. The occurrence of the translocation breakpoint at the C delta locus, normally rearranged in immature T cells, and the structure of the translocation junctions suggests that the translocation occurred during an attempt at normal rearrangement of the J delta segment in an early thymocyte.
Human populations throughout the world are exposed daily to low levels of environmental contaminants. The consequences of potential interactions of these compounds to human endocrine, reproductive, and immune function remain unknown. The current study examines the effects of subchronic oral exposure to a complex mixture of ubiquitous persistent environmental contaminants that have been quantified in human reproductive tissues. The dosing solution used in this study contained organochlorines (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [TCDD], polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs],p,p'-dichlorodiphenoxydichloroethylene [p,p'-DDE],p,p-dichlorodiphenoxytrichloroethane [p,p'-DDT], dieldrin, endosulfan, methoxychlor, hexachlorobenzene, and other chlorinated benzenes, hexachlorocyclohexane, mirex and heptachlor) as well as metals (lead and cadmium). Each chemical was included in the mixture at the minimum risk level (MRL) or tolerable daily intake (TDI) as determined by the U.S. EPA or ATSDR or, for TCDD, at the no observable effect level (NOEL) used to calculate the TDI. Sexually mature male rats were exposed to this complex mixture at 1, 10, 100, and 1000 times the estimated safe levels daily for 70 days. On day 71, all animals were sacrificed and a variety of physiological systems assessed for toxic effects. Evidence of hepatotoxicity was seen in the significant enlargement of the liver in the 1000x group, reduced serum LDH activity (100x), and increased serum cholesterol and protein levels (both 1000x). Hepatic EROD activities were elevated in animals exposed to10x and above. The mixture caused decreased proliferation of splenic T cells at the highest dose and had a biphasic effect on natural killer cell lytic activity with an initial increase in activity at 1x followed by a decrease to below control levels in response to 1000x. No treatment-related effects were seen on bone marrow micronuclei, daily sperm production, serum LH, FSH, or prolactin levels or weights of most organs of the reproductive tract. The weights of the whole epididymis and of the caput epididymis were significantly decreased at 10x and higher doses, although no effect was seen on cauda epididymal weight. The sperm content of the cauda epididymis was increased at the 1x level but not significantly different from control at higher dose levels. A slight, but significant, increase in the relative numbers of spermatids was seen in the animals from the 1000x group with a trend towards reduced proportion of diploid cells at the same dose. Only minor, nondose related changes were seen in parameters related to condensation of chromatin, as determined by flow cytometry, in epididymal sperm. We conclude that the mixture induced effects on the liver and kidney and on general metabolism at high doses but caused only minor effects on immune function, reproductive hormone levels, or general indices of reproductive function measures. These data suggest that additive or synergistic effects of exposure to contaminants resulting in residue levels representative of contemporary human tissue levels are unlikely to result in adverse effects on immune function or reproductive physiology in male rats.
A study was conducted to determine whether combination treatment using allopurinol and benzbromarone was more useful than single allopurinol treatment for the gout and hyperuricemia accompanying renal dysfunction. The subjects were 45 male patients who received urate-lowering treatment and showed a stable serum urate level. The patients were divided into four groups according to the urate-lowering treatment and creatinine clearance (Ccr) (A group: single treatment, normofunction, B group: single treatment, hypofunction, C group: combined treatment, normofunction, D group: combined treatment, hypofunction). There were no differences in serum urate levels among the four groups. Urate clearance (CUA)and daily urinary urate excretion (UUAV) showed significantly high values in the C group, but no difference was seen in the fractional excretion of urate (FEUA) among the four groups. The dosage of allopurinol in the D group was significantly lower than in the A and B groups. Serum oxypurinol concentration in the C group was lower than that in the B group. Oxypurinol clearance (C oxypurinol) in the C group was significantly high compared with the B and D groups. There was a close correlation between C oxypurinol, Ccr, and CUA, with an especially strong correlation between C oxypurinol and CUA. There were no differences in the serum concentration and clearance of xanthine and hypoxanthine among the four groups. Results of the study suggested that combination treatment using allopurinol and benzbromarone for the gout and hyperuricemia accompanying renal dysfunction is more useful, because a lower dose of allopurinol can be used and the serum oxypurinol concentration is reduced compared with single allopurinol treatment.
