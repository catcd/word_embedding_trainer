1. In this study we hypothesized that in individuals with certain genetic makeup, MTBE, benzene or their metabolites act as adducts and may induce programmed cell death. 2. Our study involved a group of 60 male and female subjects who were exposed to MTBE and benzene-contaminated water concentrations up to 76 PPB for MTBE and 14 PPB for benzene, for a period of 5 to 8 years. For comparison, we recruited a control group consisting of 32 healthy males and females with similar age distribution and without a history of exposure to MTBE or benzene. 3. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of both groups were tested for the percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle progression using flow cytometry. 4. When apoptotic lymphocytes from exposed individuals were compared to apoptotic lymphocytes from the control group, statistically-significant differences between each mean group were detected (26.4 +/- 1.8 and 12.1 +/- 1.3, respectively), indicating an increased rate of apoptosis in 80.5% of exposed individuals (P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U-Test). MTBE and benzene-induced apoptosis is attributed to a discrete block within the cell cycle progression. Because cell cycle analysis showed that in PBL from chemically-exposed individuals, between 20-50% of cells were accumulated at the S-G2/M boundaries. 5. One of the signaling molecules which mediates programmed cell death is nuclear factor Kappa-B (NF-kappa B). NF-kappa B was examined as one of the many molecular mechanisms for mediating cell death by MTBE and benzene. Indeed, addition of inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), to the lymphocytes of the chemically-exposed group was capable of inhibiting programmed cell death by 40%. This reversal of apoptosis almost to the control level by inhibitor of NF-kappa B activation may indicate involvement of this signaling molecule in MTBE and benzene induction of programmed cell death.
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a multisystem ectopic mineralization disorder caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene. Warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant, is associated with increased mineralization of the arterial blood vessels and cardiac valves. We hypothesized that warfarin may accelerate ectopic tissue mineralization in PXE, with clinical consequences. To test this hypothesis, we developed a model in which Abcc6(-/-) mice, which recapitulate features of PXE, were fed a diet supplemented with warfarin and vitamin K1. Warfarin action was confirmed by significantly increased serum levels of oxidized vitamin K. For mice placed on a warfarin-containing diet, quantitative chemical and morphometric analyses revealed massive accumulation of mineral deposits in a number of tissues. Mice fed a warfarin-containing diet were also shown to have abundant uncarboxylated form of matrix Gla protein, which allowed progressive tissue mineralization to ensue. To explore the clinical relevance of these findings, 1747 patients with PXE from the approximately 4000 patients in the PXE International database were surveyed about the use of warfarin. Of the 539 respondents, 2.6% reported past or present use of warfarin. Based on the prevalence of PXE (approximately 1:50,000), thousands of patients with PXE worldwide may be at risk for worsening of PXE as a result of warfarin therapy.
Compared to younger animals, aged male Brown Norway (BN) rats demonstrate increased body fat and serum insulin, and lower prepro-neuropeptide Y (ppNPY) mRNA content in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and blunted food intake (FI) and body weight (BW) gain in response to a 72 h fast. Since centrally administered insulin decreases FI and weight of young rats and inhibits fasting-induced increases of NPY gene expression, we hypothesized that hyperinsulinemia in old rats contributes to an age-related central dysregulation of energy balance. Young, middle-aged and old BN rats were fed chow with troglitazone (Trog; 200 mg/kg BW/d) or without drug for 75 d (Experiment 1) or 66 d (Experiment 2). Rats were then fasted for 72 h, refed for 2 weeks and sacrificed after an overnight fast (Experiment 1) or fasted for 72 h and sacrificed (Experiment 2). Serum insulin and leptin were measured from trunk blood and brains were analyzed for ppNPY mRNA by in situ hybridization. In Experiment 1, troglitazone treatment resulted in increased post-fast weight gain, rate of gain and FI in old rats. Troglitazone decreased serum insulin by 50% in old rats, while leptin levels decreased 20-30% in all age groups in Experiment 1. No differences in serum insulin or leptin were detectable with troglitazone treatment in Experiment 2, due to the extreme suppression caused by the 72 h fast. Troglitazone treatment did not increase ARC NPY gene expression either after a 72 h fast and re-feeding for 2 weeks (Experiment 1) or immediately after a 72 h fast (Experiment 2). These findings suggest that increased insulin levels may contribute to age-related impairments of FI and BW regulation. However, improvements in these defects in energy regulation induced by troglitazone do not appear to result from changes in NPY gene expression, and may be due to alterations in other hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate energy balance.
Several clinical reports have suggested that there is a hyperactivation of the dopaminergic system in people with autism. Using rats exposed prenatally to valproic acid (VPA) as an animal model of autism, we measured dopamine (DA) levels in samples collected from the frontal cortex (FC) using in vivo microdialysis and HPLC. The basal DA level in FC was significantly higher in VPA-exposed rats relative to controls. Since the mesocortical DA system is known to be sensitive to physical and psychological stressors, we measured DA levels in FC before, during, and after a 60-min forced swim test (FST). There were further gradual increases in FC DA levels during the FST in the VPA-exposed rats, but not in the control rats. Behavioral analysis during the last 10 min of the FST revealed a significant decrease in active, escape-oriented behavior and an increase in immobility, which is thought to reflect the development of depressive behavior that disengages the animal from active forms of coping with stressful stimuli. These results suggest that this rodent model of autism exhibits a hyperactive mesocortical DA system, which is exaggerated by swim stress. This abnormality may be responsible for depressive and withdrawal behavior observed in autism.
On comparison of the values of receptor selectivity of a series of m-cholinoblockers in vitro with those of the selectivity of their effect in in vivo experiments, pharmacological tests characterizing the interaction of ligands with m1, m2, and m3-subtypes of muscarine receptors were determined. Analysis of the protective effect of m-cholinoblockers in poisoning with organophosphorus compounds (OPC) depending on their activity in the determined tests showed that blocking of the m1-cholinoceptors is responsible for the antidotal effect of the antagonists, whereas block ing of m2-cholinoceptors prevents it. It is suggested that the negative effect of m2-cholinoceptor blocking on the protective effect of the drugs in OPC poisoning is mediate d by increased excretion of the mediator into the synaptic cleft as a result of interaction of the ligands with the presynaptic autochol inoceptors.
A case of deep-vein thrombosis is reported in a female patient with multibacillary leprosy who received pulses of dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide for recurrent ENL that had not responded to prednisone and thalidomide.
Bone disorders with increased osteoclastic bone resorption are frequently associated with bone pain and inhibitors of osteoclasts reduce bone pain. Osteoclasts degrade bone minerals by secreting protons through the vacuolar H+-ATPase, creating acidic microenvironments. Because acidosis is a well-known cause of pain, we reasoned that osteoclasts cause pain through proton secretion. We explored this using an animal model in which a single subcutaneous injection of the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the hind-paw caused inflammatory hyperalgesia (hyper-responsiveness to noxious stimuli). Osteoclastic bone resorption was increased in the metatarsal bones in the CFA-injected hind-paws. CFA-induced hyperalgesia was significantly suppressed by the bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid (ZOL) and alendronate and osteoprotegerin. c-src-deficient mice in which osteoclasts are inherently dysfunctional exhibited reduced CFA-induced hyperalgesia. Repeated subcutaneous injections of parathyroid hormone-related protein into the hind-paw also induced hyperalgesia with increased osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperalgesia was associated with increased mRNA expression of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) 1a, 1b and 3 in the ipsi-lateral dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) by RT-PCR and c-Fos in the ipsi-lateral spinal dorsal horn by immunohistochemistry. Of note, ZOL decreased the ASIC1a mRNA expression and c-Fos. Treatment of the DRG cell line F-11 with acid (pH5.5) increased ASIC1a, 1b and 3 mRNA expression and nuclear c-Fos expression. The ASIC blocker amiloride inhibited acid-induced c-Fos expression in F-11 cells. Moreover, F-11 cells transfected with the transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1) showed increased acid-induced nuclear c-Fos expression compared with parental F-11 cells. Finally, bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, reversed the hyperalgesia and down-regulated ASIC1a mRNA expression in the DRGs. These results led us to propose that osteoclasts play a part in CFA-induced inflammatory pain through an activation of the acid-sensing receptors including ASICs and TRPV1 by creating acidosis.
Mild myoclonus is reasonably common with various cyclic antidepressants. However, antidepressants rarely cause severe myoclonus, and no risk or predisposing factors have been reported in the literature. We report a case of exceptionally severe myoclonus developing at therapeutic doses and modest serum levels of imipramine. The patient went on to experience dystonia and catatonia. Both of these were in typical settings (after haloperidol and with psychotic bipolar depression, respectively) and responded to typical treatment. On further investigation, the patient was found to have left-sided schizencephaly and a corresponding history of very mild developmental delay. We suggest that the onset of one movement disorder after drug therapy (eg, myoclonus) may predict the development of other movement disorders (e.g., catatonia). We further propose that severe tricyclic-induced myoclonus should prompt the physician to rule out a coexisting structural lesion of the central nervous system.
Lithium-induced tremor classically responds to treatment with propranolol. Since it is metabolized in the liver, propranolol may not be the drug of choice in those patients who have compromised liver function or who are recovering from prior liver diseases. Another nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker, nadolol, has no hepatic biotransformation. We present here the first case report of successful treatment of lithium-induced tremor with nadolol, which was selected because the patient had compromised liver function. The patient's liver function tests remained stable with the therapy.
Divalproex sodium was given to a series of agitated individuals with a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Objective measures of agitation were then used to assess the effect of the divalproex sodium on such behavior. Demographic, diagnostic, medical, and physiological data were compiled on the subjects and the variation in the amount of time spent in an agitated state was evaluated in an attempt to account for the variation. We found that divalproex sodium reduced agitation in a variety of psychiatric conditions. It seems to be especially effective in the treatment of the agitated patient with bipolar illness or borderline personality disorder.
We have examined the potential of a novel cytokine, interleukin-27 (IL-27), for gene therapy of prostate cancer. IL-27 is the most recently characterized member of the family of heterodimeric IL-12-related cytokines and has shown promise in halting tumor growth and mediating tumor regression in several cancer models. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of a new mode of gene delivery to prostate tumors: low-frequency ultrasound irradiation or "sonoporation." We also examined the potential of IL-27 gene delivery by sonoporation to treat and reduce the growth of prostate cancer in vivo. We used three models of immune-competent prostate adenocarcinoma and characterized the tumor-growth reduction, gene-profile expression, and effector cellular profiles. Our results suggest that IL-27 can be effective in reducing tumor growth and can help enhance accumulation of effector cells in prostate tumors in vivo. These results are promising, because they are potentially relevant to developing novel therapies that can be translated by using the novel and effective sonoporation gene-therapy delivery strategy.
The present investigation provides mechanistic insights into the hyperglycemic and stressogenic effects of monocrotophos, an organophosphorus insecticide. Pre-treatment of rats with mifepristone (glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) prevented induction of liver tyrosine aminotransferase activity (TAT), but was ineffective in attenuating hyperglycemia induced by monocrotophos. Pre-treatment with propranolol (β-adrenergic receptor antagonist) and phentolamine (α-adrenergic receptor antagonist) were effective in abrogating monocrotophos-induced hyperglycemia. Interestingly, while propranolol offered partial protection against hyperglycemia, phentolamine completely abolished the same. However, monocrotophos-induced hyperlactacidemia was completely abolished by propranolol. Both the adrenoreceptor antagonists, however, failed to attenuate the stressogenic potential of monocrotophos. Hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia induced by monocrotophos were abolished by pre-treatment with atropine. Exogenous epinephrine was associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia. The impact of adrenergic antagonists on epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia were remarkably similar to that of monocrotophos-induced hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia. Further, hydrazine sulfate (a gluconeogenesis inhibitor) abolished hyperglycemia in monocrotophos-treated rats. From our data, it can be hypothesized that excessive stimulation of adrenoreceptors, probably elicited by increased plasma epinephrine, mediates hyperglycemic outcomes induced by monocrotophos. Pattern of changes in plasma lactate suggests that β-adrenergic activation mediates monocrotophos-induced hyperlactacidemia, while α-adrenergic receptor mediates lactate utilization, leading to hyperglycemia. Induction of liver TAT activity is attributable to glucocorticoid receptor activation as a result of hypercorticosteronemia.
To determine whether a hyperpolarization-activated current (If) participates in ventricular tachyarrhythmias, we investigated the effects of zatebradine, an I(f) inhibitor, on the ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by ouabain, two-stage coronary ligation and epinephrine infusion in the dog heart. We determined atrial rate, ectopic ventricular rate, total heart rate and arrhythmic ratio (the number of ectopic ventricular beats divided by total heart beats). Zatebradine (0.15, 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg, i.v.) dose dependently decreased the arrhythmic ratio, ectopic ventricular rate and atrial rate of the ouabain-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. The inhibition by zatebradine of the ventricular arrhythmias needed larger doses than the inhibition of the atrial rate. Zatebradine weakly depressed the ectopic ventricular rate but not the arrhythmic ratio of the ventricular arrhythmias induced by two-stage coronary ligation 24 h after the ligation in conscious dogs. Although neither the ectopic ventricular rate nor the arrhythmic ratio of the epinephrine-induced ventricular arrhythmias was affected by zatebradine, after treatment with zatebradine, the arrhythmias elicited by epinephrine developed more slowly. Together with the previously reported spectra of the effects of the antiarrhythmic agents in three ventricular tachyarrhythmia models, our results suggest that zatebradine may improve automaticity-related ventricular tachyarrhythmias due to I(f) inhibition or to other undetermined mechanisms in the heart.
Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics were shown to be related to toxicity and survival.
We evaluated the effects of time above paclitaxel concentrations of 0.05 micromol/l (T(>0.05) and systemic exposures (AUC) to total and unbound paclitaxel (tPAC, uPAC) on response in patients with advanced cancer treated with weekly 1-h or 3-h infusions.
After 6 weeks of therapy (WOT), 13 out of 21 assessable patients showed either partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), while 8 had progressive disease (PD). As compared to patients with PD, those with PR or SD showed similar AUCs to uPAC and tPAC but higher (p < 0.05) T (>0.05). Patients with T(>0.05) > or = 20.7 hours had lower probability (p < 0.05) to progress within 12 WOT.
Taking the heterogeneity of the studied tumor types into account, we found T(>0.05) to be associated with response to treatment. This emphasizes the value of threshold models for the investigation of paclitaxel pharmacodynamics.
Hypertension developing after liver transplantation during immunosuppression with cyclosporine A reflects an unusual hemodynamic transition from peripheral vasodilation to systemic and renal vasoconstriction. Although dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are often administered for their efficacy in promoting vasodilation, some liver transplant recipients report marked symptomatic intolerance to these agents. In the present study we examined systemic and renal responses to isradipine using systemic (thoracic bioimpedance) and renal hemodynamic measurements in 15 liver transplant recipients studied at the time of initial diagnosis of posttransplant hypertension and after 3 months of treatment. Circadian blood pressure patterns were examined by overnight ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before and during antihypertensive therapy. During isradipine administration, blood pressure decreased from 151 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 to 130 +/-3/81 +/- 2 mm Hg (P < .01) without change in renal blood flow (406 +/- 43 to 425 +/- 52 mL/min/1.73m2, P = NS) or renal vascular resistance index (25,674 +/-3312 to 20,520 +/- 2311 dynes x sec x cm(-5)/m2, P = NS). Pre-treatment differences in systemic vascular tone persisted during treatment and predicted the tendency for symptomatic tachycardia and flushing, predominantly in those with hyperdynamic circulations. Twice daily dosing of isradipine was associated with partial and significant restoration of the nocturnal decrease in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure decreased 5.5%, normal 13%), usually absent early after transplantation. Our results demonstrate the ability of hemodynamic measurements to predict the symptomatic response to antihypertensive therapy in the posttransplant setting.
Due to potential proarrhythmic side-effects levo-alpha-Acetylmethadol (LAAM) is currently not available in EU countries as maintenance drug in the treatment of opiate addiction. However, recent studies and meta-analyses underline the clinical advantages of LAAM with respect to the reduction of heroin use. Thus a reappraisal of LAAM has been demanded. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative impact of LAAM on QTc-interval, as a measure of pro-arrhythmic risk, in comparison to methadone, the current standard in substitution therapy.
ECG recordings were analysed within a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of maintenance treatment with LAAM compared with racemic methadone. Recordings were done at two points: 1) during a run-in period with all patients on methadone and 2) 24 weeks after randomisation into methadone or LAAM treatment group. These ECG recordings were analysed with respect to QTc-values and QTc-dispersion. Mean values as well as individual changes compared to baseline parameters were evaluated. QTc-intervals were classified according to CPMP-guidelines.
Complete ECG data sets could be obtained in 53 patients (31 LAAM-group, 22 methadone-group). No clinical cardiac complications were observed in either group. After 24 weeks, patients receiving LAAM showed a significant increase in QTc-interval (0.409s +/- 0.022s versus 0.418s +/- 0.028s, p = 0.046), whereas no significant changes could be observed in patients remaining on methadone. There was no statistically significant change in QTc-dispersion in either group. More patients with borderline prolonged and prolonged QTc-intervals were observed in the LAAM than in the methadone treatment group (n = 7 vs. n = 1; p = 0.1).
In this controlled trial LAAM induced QTc-prolongation in a higher degree than methadone. Given reports of severe arrhythmic events, careful ECG-monitoring is recommended under LAAM medication.
Impairment of liver mitochondrial beta-oxidation is an important mechanism of drug-induced liver injury. Four inhibitors of fatty acid oxidation were compared in short-term rat in vivo studies in which the rats were administered one or four doses. The hepatocellular vacuolation represented ultra-structural mitochondrial changes. Urine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed that both FOX988 and SDZ51-641 induced a persistent dicarboxylic aciduria, suggesting an inhibition of mitochondrial beta-oxidation and incomplete fatty acid metabolism. Etomoxir caused minimal mitochondrial ultrastructural changes and induced only transient dicarboxylic aciduria. CPI975 served as a negative control, in that there were no significant perturbations to the mitochondrial ultrastructural morphology or in the urine NMR composition; however, compound exposure was confirmed by the up-regulation of liver gene expression compared to vehicle control. The liver gene expression changes that were altered by the compounds were indicative of mitochondria, general and oxidative stress, and peroxisomal enzymes involved in beta-oxidation, suggestive of a compensatory response to the inhibition in the mitochondria. In addition, both FOX988 and SDZ51-641 up-regulated ribosomal genes associated with apoptosis, as well as p53 pathways linked with apoptosis. In summary, metabonomics and liver gene expression provided mechanistic information on mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired fatty acid oxidation to further define the clinical pathology and histopathology findings of hepatotoxicity.
Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction is a common and significant cause of patient distress and noncompliance with treatment. A number of adjunctive pharmacologic strategies, including yohimbine, cyproheptadine, bethanechol, and amantadine, have been employed previously. We report a case of using bupropion to treat fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction in a 50-year-old man with a history of recurrent major depression. This is the first case of such treatment we know. Sexual dysfunction induced by fluoxetine is thought secondary to effects on the serotonin system. Bupropion is an antidepressant with minimal sexual side effects. The mechanism by which bupropion resolved this sexual dysfunction is unknown, but it may be related to its mild dopamine uptake blockade.
We have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix (ECM)/integrin signaling via elimination of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver regeneration. This study investigates the role of ILK in liver enlargement induced by phenobarbital (PB). Wild-type (WT) and ILK:liver-/- mice were given PB (0.1% in drinking water) for 10 days. Livers were harvested on 2, 5, and 10 days during PB administration. In the hepatocyte-specific ILK/liver-/- mice, the liver:body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 (2.5 times), while at days 5 and 10, it was enlarged three times. In the WT mice, the increase was as expected from previous literature (1.8 times) and seems to have leveled off after day 2. There were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in the ILK/liver-/- animals at day 2 as compared to WT after PB administration. In the WT animals, the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10. Hepatocytes of the ILK/liver-/- mice continued to proliferate up until day 10. ILK/liver-/- mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during PB administration. In summary, ECM proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via ILK to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative response. Lack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB.
Zinc deficiency in humans is associated with an increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer. In rodents, zinc deficiency predisposes to carcinogenesis by causing proliferation and alterations in gene expression. We examined whether in zinc-deficient rodents, targeted disruption of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 pathway by the COX-2 selective inhibitor celecoxib or by genetic deletion prevent UADT carcinogenesis. Tongue cancer prevention studies were conducted in zinc-deficient rats previously exposed to a tongue carcinogen by celecoxib treatment with or without zinc replenishment, or by zinc replenishment alone. The ability of genetic COX-2 deletion to protect against chemically-induced forestomach tumorigenesis was examined in mice on zinc-deficient versus zinc-sufficient diet. The expression of 3 predictive biomarkers COX-2, nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B p65 and leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4)H) was examined by immunohistochemistry. In zinc-deficient rats, celecoxib without zinc replenishment reduced lingual tumor multiplicity but not progression to malignancy. Celecoxib with zinc replenishment or zinc replenishment alone significantly lowered lingual squamous cell carcinoma incidence, as well as tumor multiplicity. Celecoxib alone reduced overexpression of the 3 biomarkers in tumors slightly, compared with intervention with zinc replenishment. Instead of being protected, zinc-deficient COX-2 null mice developed significantly greater tumor multiplicity and forestomach carcinoma incidence than wild-type controls. Additionally, zinc-deficient COX-2-/- forestomachs displayed strong LTA(4)H immunostaining, indicating activation of an alternative pathway under zinc deficiency when the COX-2 pathway is blocked. Thus, targeting only the COX-2 pathway in zinc-deficient animals did not prevent UADT carcinogenesis. Our data suggest zinc supplementation should be more thoroughly explored in human prevention clinical trials for UADT cancer.
Organophosphates (OP) inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7), both in peripheral tissues and central nervous system (CNS), causing adverse and sometimes fatal effects due to the accumulation of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The currently used therapy, focusing on the reactivation of inhibited AChE, is limited to peripheral tissues because commonly used quaternary pyridinium oxime reactivators do not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) at therapeutically relevant levels. A directed library of thirty uncharged oximes that contain tertiary amine or imidazole protonable functional groups that should cross the BBB as unionized species was tested as tabun-hAChE conjugate reactivators along with three reference oximes: DAM (diacetylmonoxime), MINA (monoisonitrosoacetone), and 2-PAM. The oxime RS150D [N-((1-(3-(2-((hydroxyimino)methyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)propyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)benzamide] was highlighted as the most promising reactivator of the tabun-hAChE conjugate. We also observed that oximes RS194B [N-(2-(azepan-1-yl)ethyl)-2-(hydroxyimino)acetamide] and RS41A [2-(hydroxyimino)-N-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl)acetamide], which emerged as lead uncharged reactivators of phosphylated hAChE with other OPs (sarin, cyclosarin and VX), exhibited only moderate reactivation potency for tabun inhibited hAChE. This implies that geometry of oxime access to the phosphorus atom conjugated to the active serine is an important criterion for efficient reactivation, along with the chemical nature of the conjugated moiety: phosphorate, phosphonate, or phosphoramidate. Moreover, modification of the active center through mutagenesis enhances the rates of reactivation. The phosphoramidated-hAChE choline-binding site mutant Y337A showed three-times enhanced reactivation capacity with non-triazole imidazole containing aldoximes (RS113B, RS113A and RS115A) and acetamide derivative (RS194B) than with 2PAM.
Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1/redox factor-1 (APE/Ref-1) is a multifunctional protein involved in DNA base excision repair and redox regulation of many transcription factors. In different melanoma cell lines, we found that both nucleus and cytoplasm exhibited higher levels of Ref-1 compared with normal melanocytes. Similar increases of Ref-1 expression, detected by immunohistofluorescence, were also evident in nevi and malignant melanoma biopsies compared with normal skin, which were predominantly localized in the nucleus. Using recombinant adenovirus Adref-1, encoding full-length Ref-1, we transiently overexpressed APE/Ref-1 in human melanocytes, which protected these cells from UVB-induced apoptosis and increased foci formation in culture. Ref-1 overexpression also protected melanoma cells from cisplatin- or H2O2-induced apoptosis, whereas increased apoptosis was observed with Ref-1 antisense construct infection. These observations suggested that intracellular Ref-1 levels played an important role in sensitization of melanoma cells to apoptosis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay results showed that in both cultured primary and metastatic melanomas DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB were significantly diminished or shifted when anti-APE/Ref-1 antibody was added to deplete APE/Ref-1 from the binding complexes. Induced nuclear factor-kappaB transcriptional activities were also evident after Ref-1 overexpression. Furthermore, using three-dimensional molecular structure modeling and virtual screening, we found that resveratrol, a natural compound found in fruits and vegetables, docks into a druggable pocket of Ref-1 protein. In vitro studies revealed that resveratrol inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, Ref-1-activated activator protein-1 DNA-binding activities as well as Ref-1 endonuclease activities and rendered melanoma cells more sensitive to dacarbazine treatment.
