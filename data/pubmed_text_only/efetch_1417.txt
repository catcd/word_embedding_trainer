Tolazoline is a potent vasodilator of both arteries and veins and has a powerful effect on the pulmonary vasculature, reducing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and lowering pulmonary artery pressure. Intravenous tolazoline lowers the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance and increases the cardiac index when given to infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Endotracheally administered tolazoline decreases mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, and improves oxygenation without the harmful decline in systemic arterial pressure. The purpose of our study was to examine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of endotracheal tolazoline in order to determine the relationship between endotracheal tolazoline administration, plasma concentration and its effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Tolazoline was administered endotracheally to 7 newborn dogs, and its serum concentration and the haemodynamic parameters were monitored for 270 min post-delivery. Results are expressed as median and quartiles. It was found that 15 s after dosing, tolazoline plasma concentrations started to increase significantly above baseline levels, reaching a maximum of 2.64 (1.36; 13.16) microg/ml. The extent of tolazoline absorption was 305 (148;453) microg/ min/ml. The volume of distribution was 3.4 (1.6;7.4) 1/kg. The total body clearance was 12.1 (10.9;23.9) ml/min/kg and the elimination half-life was 225 (171;303) min. Endotracheal tolazoline produced an initial short-lived decrease in mean blood pressure in all the dogs, but thereafter the blood pressure increased gradually above baseline levels. Immediately following endotracheal tolazoline significant tachycardia developed, peaking at 90 min. Subsequently, the heart rate gradually decreased and stabilized at values above baseline for 200 min. A single endotracheal dose of tolazoline is effectively absorbed and produces measurable pharmacological effects. Determining the optimal endotracheal dose of tolazoline in the clinical setting requires additional evaluation.
Colchicine is known to inhibit axoplasmic transport in ganglion cells. Previous studies have shown considerable, but largely reversible, retinal changes after low dosages of intravitreal colchicine in experimental animals. In the present study, the effects of 1.0 to 100 micrograms of intravitreal colchicine in monkeys were studied by ophthalmoscopy, light microscopy, and electron microscopy. Optic atrophy was ophthalmoscopically evident within 4 weeks after a single dose of 10 micrograms or more. Morphologic changes included progressive swelling of retinal neurons, accumulation of a fibrillogranular material, displacement of organelles, and loss of microtubules. Plasmalemmal rupture was observed in ganglion cells and in photoreceptors after as little as 1 microgram of colchicine. Relative sparing of the cone cells was noted. The retina of monkeys appears to be more sensitive to intravitreal colchicine than that of certain lower animals.
Zetidoline (ZTD), a compound chemically unrelated to any available antipsychotic, with selective dopamine receptor-blocking properties, was compared with haloperidol (HLP) in a double-blind study on 56 in-patients who had either first episodes or acute relapses of schizophrenia. ZTD was found to be safe, as effective as HLP, and to produce significantly fewer extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS).
Two haemodialysis patients with aluminium encephalopathy developed dramatic deteriorations of their neurological symptoms after initiation of desferrioxamine (DFO) therapy. Both patients were treated with relatively large doses of DFO (1 g and 2 g per treatment). In the first case, paranoid delusions, visual hallucinations, seizures and deteriorating speech followed each dialysis treatment with DFO. The second patient experienced increasing confusion, decreasing short-term memory, and deterioration in speech. In both cases the neurological symptoms regressed after decreasing or discontinuing the DFO. These patients demonstrate the potential dangers of using high doses of DFO. The pathogenesis of the exacerbation is not well understood but, may not simply be due to the result of elevated plasma aluminium levels after DFO therapy. We argue in this communication for reducing DFO in patients with aluminium encephalopathy to doses of 1 g three times per week to ensure adequate treatment of aluminium encephalopathy while minimising the risk of exacerbation from overzealous DFO administration.
6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN) is a niacin antagonist, which leads to degeneration of gray matter astrocytes mainly in the brainstem. We have examined the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in this degenerative process by using transgenic mice with astrocyte-targeted IL-6 expression (GFAP-IL6 mice). This study demonstrates that transgenic IL-6 expression significantly increases the 6-AN-induced inflammatory response of reactive astrocytes, microglia/macrophages, and lymphocytes in the brainstem. Also, IL-6 induced significant increases in proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha as well as growth factors basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-beta, neurotrophin-3, angiopoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and the receptor for bFGF. In accordance, angiogenesis was increased in GFAP-IL6 mice relative to controls after 6-AN. Moreover, oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death were significantly reduced by transgenic IL-6 expression. IL-6 is also a major inducer in the CNS of metallothionein I and II (MT-I+II), which were significantly increased in the GFAP-IL6 mice. MT-I+II are antioxidants and neuroregenerative factors in the CNS, so increased MT-I+II levels in GFAP-IL6 mice could contribute to the reduction of oxidative stress and cell death in these mice.
A 73-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of weight loss and pretibial edema. Plasma levels of adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were elevated, and neither hormone showed circadian rhythm. Dexamethasone (2 mg for 2 days) failed to reduce the urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and the plasma cortisol level. The stomach biopsy specimens showed a moderately-differentiated papillo-tubular adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed multiple metastases to the liver. Immunohistochemical staining of the autopsy specimens showed immunoreactive ACTH in the primary tumor cells of the stomach as well as the metastatic tumor cells of the liver. On the basis of the clinical, histological and immunohistochemical findings, we diagnosed this patient as having ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by adenocarcinoma of the stomach.
Thirteen patients whose hypertension had been resistant to conventional drug therapy, had minoxidil added to their regimen in doses from 5 to 60 mg/day. All responded with satisfactory reductions of blood pressure to mean values of 149/90mm Hg (supine) and 143/89mm Hg (standing). A significant portion of their previous antihypertensive therapy was either greatly decreased or withdrawn completely. Although fluid retention occurred in most patients as the dose of minoxidil was increased, this could be successfully checked by the use of diuretics. It was considered that in addition to beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs to control the reflexly induced cardiac stimulation, sufficiently aggressive diuretic therapy is mandatory to ensure the successful use of this drug. Haemodynamic evaluations in seven patients clearly showed that lowering of blood pressure was the result of decreases in peripheral vascular resistance as significant increases in the cardiac index occurred in all patients.
Previously, we reported germline DNA variants associated with risk of urinary bladder cancer (UBC) in Dutch and Icelandic subjects. Here we expanded the Icelandic sample set and tested the top 20 markers from the combined analysis in several European case-control sample sets, with a total of 4,739 cases and 45,549 controls. The T allele of rs798766 on 4p16.3 was found to associate with UBC (odds ratio = 1.24, P = 9.9 x 10(-12)). rs798766 is located in an intron of TACC3, 70 kb from FGFR3, which often harbors activating somatic mutations in low-grade, noninvasive UBC. Notably, rs798766[T] shows stronger association with low-grade and low-stage UBC than with more aggressive forms of the disease and is associated with higher risk of recurrence in low-grade stage Ta tumors. The frequency of rs798766[T] is higher in Ta tumors that carry an activating mutation in FGFR3 than in Ta tumors with wild-type FGFR3. Our results show a link between germline variants, somatic mutations of FGFR3 and risk of UBC.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons. Using unbiased transcript profiling in an ALS mouse model, we identified a role for the co-stimulatory pathway, a key regulator of immune responses. Furthermore, we observed that this pathway is upregulated in the blood of 56% of human patients with ALS. A therapy using a monoclonal antibody to CD40L was developed that slows weight loss, delays paralysis and extends survival in an ALS mouse model. This work demonstrates that unbiased transcript profiling can identify cellular pathways responsive to therapeutic intervention in a preclinical model of human disease.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by many types of genetic defects, including premature stop codons. Gentamicin can suppress stop mutations in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in vitro and in vivo, leading to improvements in CFTR-dependent ion transport and protein localization to the apical surface of respiratory epithelial cells. The primary objective of this study was to test whether nasally administered gentamicin or tobramycin could suppress premature stop mutations in CFTR, resulting in full-length, functional protein. A secondary objective was to obtain data to aid in the design of multicenter trials using the nasal potential difference as a study endpoint. A multicenter study was conducted in two cohorts of patients with CF, those heterozygous for stop mutations in the CFTR gene and those without nonsense mutations, to investigate the effects of both gentamicin and tobramycin administered over a 28-d period on sequential nasal potential difference and airway cell immunofluorescence endpoints. Eleven patients with CF with stop mutations were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover fashion to receive each drug, while 18 subjects with CF without stop mutations were randomized 1:1 in a parallel fashion to receive one drug. After demonstration of drug delivery, neither aminoglycoside produced detectable changes in nasal ion transport or CFTR localization in brushed cells from either study group. These results with first-generation suppressive agents suggest the need for improved drug delivery methods and/or more potent suppressors of nonsense mutations to confer CFTR correction in subjects with CF heterozygous for nonsense mutations. The study provides valuable information on parameters of the nasal potential difference measurements for use in future multicenter clinical trials.
A 26-year-old man was admitted to a hospital complaing of continuous high fever and abdominal swelling. As his sputum and ascites culture was positive for acid-fast bacilli and PCR-TB, he was diagnosed as miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous with pleuritis and peritonitis, and transferrd to our hospital. After initiation of treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin (RFP), ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, RFP was suspended because of direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia. As the liver function recovered after discontinuation of RFP, low dose of RFP was re-administrated and renal dysfunction was observed. The renal dysfunction continued after discontinuation of suspicious drugs including RFP. As renal biopsy revealed interstitial nephritis, prednisolon 20 mg/day was started and renal function recovered quickly. From the clinical course and examination, we considered interstitial nephritis was due to re-administration of RFP and steroid therapy was effective.
We describe a child whose original clinical and radiologic manifestations led to a diagnosis of Desbuquois dysplasia. Subsequent development of features including cervical kyphosis and cystic ears caused us to reconsider the original diagnosis. The new complement of features in this patient fell in a range between Desbuquois dysplasia and diastrophic dysplasia. Molecular testing showed that she is a compound heterozygote for mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter gene (DTDST). This finding confirms that there is locus heterogeneity in apparent Desbuquois dysplasia. It also expands the phenotypic spectrum of disorders caused by mutations in DTDST.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a relentless neurodegenerative disease of uncertain etiology affecting millions worldwide. Stress is an important etiological factor associated with AD. Stress and glucocorticoids (GCs) are intimately related; so much so that stress is considered to be "a condition that is able to liberate GCs". Normally, GCs are required for various bodily functions but their excess is deleterious. Hippocampus has highest density of GC receptors in brain, is particularly vulnerable to their damaging effects and undergoes reversible atrophy under their influence. Hippocampal atrophy is an initial event for the development of AD, the most common form of dementia. Apart from atrophy, GCs are able to produce a variety of other initial structural and functional changes in hippocampus. For example, these down regulate GC receptors, leading to disruption in negative feedback loop, alter dendtritic morphology and impair axonal transport. Impaired axon transport is probably an initial event that leads to the formation of paired helical filaments. Additionally, they inhibit insulin-degrading enzyme, which degrades A-beta; consequently reducing its clearance. Since GCs mediate a number of initial events in AD pathogenesis, therefore GC antagonists (e.g. mifepristone) can be tried. Mifepristone has intrinsic neuroprotective and antioxidant potential which could offer additional benefits as well. Use of this drug therefore, in those with mild AD or with milder cognitive impairment can be useful. Appropriate dose, duration, safety and efficacy need to be worked out.
The specific binding of [3H]hemicholinium-3 ([3H]HCh-3) and high-affinity [3H]choline uptake were measured in rats with status epilepticus induced by lithium and pilocarpine. The specific binding of [3H]HCh-3 in cortex and hippocampus from rats with status epilepticus increased to 2- to 3-fold of control while the striatal [3H]HCh-3 binding increased minimally. Scatchard analyses revealed that the observed changes resulted from an increase in Bmax of [3H]HCh-3 binding. High-affinity [3H]choline uptake remained unchanged. These results further implicate phospholipase A2 in the regulation of [3H]HCh-3 binding sites.
To determine the threshold dose of dicyclanil (DC) that induces hepatocellular tumor-promoting effects associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via their metabolic pathways, partial hepatectomized ICR male mice were fed diets containing 0, 187.5, 375 or 750 ppm DC after an intraperitoneal injection of N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. Immunohistochemically, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cell ratio was significantly increased in the DEN + 750 ppm DC group compared with the DEN alone group. However, significant increases in the number of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)-positive cells and formation of microsomal ROS were not observed in the DEN + DC groups compared with the DEN alone group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the expression of Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and OGG1genes was significantly up-regulated in mice given diets containing 375 ppm DC or more, 187.5 ppm DC or more, and 750 ppm DC, respectively. These results suggest that the threshold dose of DC that induces ROS-mediated liver tumor promotion in mice is more than 750 ppm, although expression of the Cyp1a2 gene, which is related to ROS generation, was up-regulated in the liver of mice, even at a DC dose of 187.5 ppm.
Ondansetron is a commonly used medication in the treatment of nausea and vomiting arising from many etiologies, including chemotherapy. Although it is a highly safe drug, ondansetron use has been associated, rarely, with hypokalemia. However, it is unknown whether hypokalemia is due to the medication itself or to an underlying potassium disturbance caused by prior metabolic derangements, including vomiting. We relate a patient who presents with hypokalemia of unknown etiology, with evidence suggesting a possible relationship to ondansetron. We also present a proposed mechanism for this phenomenon.
Vincristine commonly induces peripheral neuropathy but rarely causes voiding dysfunction. In this report, we describe a case of neurogenic bladder and peripheral neuropathy caused by the neurotoxic effect of vincristine and documented by urodynamic testing and electromyography. Neurologic evaluation aided in monitoring and understanding this problem.
Ochratoxin A (OTA) has displayed nephrotoxicity and renal carcinogenicity in mammals, however, no clear mechanisms have been identified detailing the relationship between oxidative stress and these toxicities. This study was performed to clarify the relationship between oxidative stress and the renal carcinogenicity induced by OTA. Rats were treated with 70 or 210 μg/kg b.w. OTA for 4 or 13 weeks. In the rats administrated with OTA for 13 weeks, the kidney was damaged seriously. Cytoplasmic vacuolization was observed in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. Karyomegaly was prominent in the tubular epithelium. Kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) was detected in the outer stripe of the outer medulla in both low- and high-dose groups. OTA increased the mRNA levels of clusterin in rat kidneys. Interestingly, OTA did not significantly alter the oxidative stress level in rat liver and kidney. Yet, some indications related to proliferation and carcinogenicity were observed. A dose-related increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was observed at 4 weeks in both liver and kidney, but at 13 weeks, only in the kidney. OTA down-regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and up-regulated vimentin and lipocalin 2 in rat kidney at 13 weeks. The p53 gene was decreased in both liver and kidney at 13 weeks. These results suggest that OTA caused apparent kidney damage within 13 weeks but exerted limited effect on oxidative stress parameters. It implies that cell proliferation is the proposed mode of action for OTA-induced renal carcinogenicity.
Mechanisms underlying the chemopreventive effects of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors remain elusive. We have previously shown that celecoxib but not indomethacin could prevent carcinogen-induced gastric cancer development in Wistar rats. This chemopreventive effect appeared to be independent of COX-2 and prostaglandin (PG) E2 suppression since the lowest PGE2 was obtained in indomethacin group. This study compared the cell kinetic changes in stomachs of rats after treatment with celecoxib (5, 10, 20 mg/(kg.d)) or indomethacin (3 mg/(kg.d)) to gain more insights into the chemopreventive mechanism.
The apoptosis and proliferation indexes in gastric tumor, adjacent non-cancer tissues and normal gastric tissues were determined. Apoptosis was quantified by apoptotic nuclei counting and TUNEL, whereas proliferation was determined by Ki67 immunostaining.
Treatment with either celecoxib or indomethacin inhibited gastric tumor proliferation by more than 65% (P<0.02). However, celecoxib caused a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis (P<0.05) which was not seen in indomethacin-treated tumors (P = 0.54). The highest apoptosis to proliferation ratio was seen in tumors treated with celecoxib at 10 mg/(kg.d). Treatment with this dose of celecoxib was associated with the lowest incidence of gastric cancer development.
Our findings suggest that the difference in chemopreventive effects of indomethacin and celecoxib in this animal model of gastric carcinogenesis is largely due to the differential cell kinetic changes, which does not correlate with the degree of COX-2 and PG suppression.
Angiotensin II type I receptor antagonists (ARAs) have been tested in two large randomized trials, Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly II (ELITE II) and the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT), and several other large trials are ongoing in the indication of chronic heart failure (CHF). Based on the available evidence, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors remain the cornerstone in the treatment of CHF. However, much more information should be available in the next few years, which will provide more evidence on how to use ARAs and in which patients.
The anti-HIV drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) is used successfully for reduction of perinatal viral transmission. However toxic side effects including carcinogenesis are possible. To test this, pregnant CD-1 Swiss mice were given 25.0 or 12.5 mg AZT on gestation days 12-18. Previously we reported an increase in lung, liver, and female reproductive system tumors in offspring euthanized at 1 year (Olivero et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 89, 1602-1608, 1997). Findings for all remaining offspring up to 2 years old are reported here. AZT effects were most prominent in female offspring, with a significant threefold increase in lung tumors, a reduction in lymphoblastic and follicle center cell lymphomas, and a significant increase in histiocytic sarcomas (0 in controls, 3% after low-dose AZT, and 8% after high-dose AZT, p = 0.022). Dose-dependent incidences of mammary gland, ovarian, and seminal vesicle tumors were low but significant: 0/106 controls, 3/105 low-dose, and 8/105 high-dose mice presented one of these neoplasms (p = 0.0025). Incidences of females showing any clearly AZT-related neoplasm, in lung, liver, ovary, or mammary gland or histiocytic sarcoma, in the second year, were 12/32 after the low dose and 14/27 after the high dose vs 3/23 controls (p = 0.0045). Also, the sensitivity of neonatal mice was assessed by administration of 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg AZT on postnatal days 1 through 8. The effects at 2 years were similar to those seen after transplacental exposure, with significant increases in lung, liver, and mammary tumors in females. The results confirm that AZT is a moderately effective perinatal carcinogen in mice, targeting several tissue types.
Vancomycin (V)-a polypeptide antibiotic-is the drug of choice in severe infections with multiresistant staphylococcus spp. Due to the multimorbidity of the patients receiving V, the interactions with known ototoxic agents and the lack of an audiometric documentation, earlier clinical reports of V-associated hearing loss must be carefully interpreted. To elucidate this topic, a controlled animal study considering nonspecific effects was performed. 40 albino guinea pigs with positive Preyer's reflex and normal hearing were used. The hearing function was controlled by means of brainstem auditory evoked potentials before and after intraperitoneal administration of V (75, 150, 300 mg/kg b.w. for 11-17 days), gentamicin (60 mg/kg b.w. for 26 days), neomycin (100 mg/kg b.w. for 17 days) and sodium chloride solution. The cochleas were dissected for hair cell counting by the surface preparation technique. Additionally, the serum concentrations of V were measured. As a result there was no significant difference in hearing loss between the controls and the animals treated with 75 and 150 mg V; toxic doses of 300 mg V led to a certain threshold elevation after click stimuli, but not after trapezoid stimuli of 1, 4 and 8 kHz. On the other hand, the aminoglycosides as a positive control caused an obvious hearing loss after click and trapezoid stimuli, which was correlated to the amount of outer hair cell loss. Renal damage could be excluded by histological examination of the kidneys and estimation of creatinine in serum. Therefore, treatment with moderate doses of V comparable to clinical conditions does not exhibit a specific ototoxicity as compared to the aminoglycosides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Rifabutin-associated uveitis has been reported frequently in AIDS patients and more rarely in immunocompetent patients. It is characterized clinically by anterior acute uveitis. Only a few poorly documented cases of rifabutin-induced panuveitis with retinal vasculitis have been reported. Here, we report four cases of rifabutin-associated panuveitis with retinal vasculitis.
We describe four patients with active tuberculosis, treated with a multidrug regimen including rifabutin for at least 1.5 months before presentation. The first patient was immunocompetent, the three others had AIDS and were undergoing triple anti-HIV therapy. Three patients were women with a low body weight. All four patients presented with panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. Interruption of the drug rapidly reduced the ocular inflammation in all cases.
Four cases of rifabutin-associated panuveitis with retinal vasculitis are reported in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Immunogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as the very low weight of the patients might be implicated in the development of this unusual form of rifabutin-associated uveitis.
The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of the 2-(acetyloxy)benzoic acid 3-(nitrooxymethyl)phenyl ester (NCX 4016), a nitric oxide (NO)-releaser derivative of aspirin, to decrease blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and to counteract the adrenergic vasoconstriction in perfused tail artery of these animals. Oral treatment for 10 consecutive days with NCX 4016 (100 micromol/kg) in SHR and their genetic controls Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats resulted in a reduction of blood pressure in SHR but not in WKY rats. In SHR, the NCX 4016 treatment increased the serum nitrite/nitrate and diminished the serum thromboxane B2, whereas aspirin did not change blood pressure but abolished the serum thromboxane B2. Perfused tail arteries excised from vehicle-treated SHR exhibited a significant impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant function. These vessels, prepared from SHR or WKY rats treated orally with NCX 4016 (10, 30 and 100 micromol/kg for 7 consecutive days), revealed a dose-dependent decrease in vasoconstriction in response to transmural nerve stimulation and norepinephrine, whereas aspirin was ineffective. Furthermore, in tail arteries of both SHR and WKY rats treated orally with NCX 4016 (100 micromol/kg for 7 consecutive days), the cGMP increased significantly. In conclusion, NCX 4016, by releasing NO and increasing cGMP in vascular tissue, reduces sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction in resistance vessels and lowers blood pressure in SHR.
3,2'-Dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), when combined with high doses of testosterone propionate (TP) induces invasive adenocarcinomas with metastatic potential in the rat prostate. The processes underlying this tumor development, including the involvement of atypical hyperplasias, were sequentially investigated in F344 rats. DMAB was given subcutaneously at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight 10 times at 2-week intervals. TP was administered chronically (in Silastic tubes) from the beginning of the experiment or after the DMAB administration until termination (week 60). Invasive adenocarcinomas were induced in the lateral and anterior prostate as well as the seminal vesicles. Atypical hyperplasias appeared from an early stage, with the later appearance of cancers being closely associated with such foci of morphological alteration. The findings confirm that combined administration of DMAB and pharmacological doses of TP yields invasive adenocarcinomas in the rat prostate and provide further support for the conclusion that atypical hyperplasias are premalignant lesions.
The safe administration of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in a man with steroid-induced depression and a history of craniotomy and gamma knife surgery for two separate foci of metastatic laryngeal cancer is reported. This is the first reported case of ECT given to a patient with a history of gamma knife surgery. The literature on ECT administration to patients with brain masses or a history of craniotomy is reviewed. The current case report indicates that with careful medical evaluation, including consultation with neurosurgeons and internal medicine physicians, ECT may be safely administered to this patient population.
The osmotic diuretic mannitol may be used in diverse clinical settings, such as providing "renal protection" in patients at risk for acute renal failure, decreasing intracranial pressure in patients with intracranial trauma, and preventing the dialysis-disequilibrium syndrome. Mannitol is commonly used after cardiac catheterization, cardiovascular surgery, and exposure to intravenous contrast dyes. This study presents a case in which a long-term renal transplant recipient receiving cyclosporine therapy concomitantly developed acute renal failure after the administration of high-dose mannitol in an attempt to induce an osmotic diuresis. The diagnosis of "osmotic nephrosis" was confirmed by renal biopsy, and the condition was reversed by cessation of the agent. Studies in experimental animals indicate that cyclosporin A can potentiate the tubular toxicity of mannitol, but such an association has not been verified in humans. Numerous studies confirm the nephrotoxic potential of high-dose mannitol, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. The clinical utility of the osmolar gap in preventing mannitol nephrotoxicity is emphasized.
