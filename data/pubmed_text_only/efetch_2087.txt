Selenoproteins contain selenocysteine (Sec), commonly considered the 21st genetically encoded amino acid. Many selenoproteins, such as the glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases, protect cells against oxidative stress by functioning as antioxidants and/or through their roles in the maintenance of intracellular redox balance. Since oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, we hypothesized that selenoproteins protect against this complication of diabetes.
C57BL/6 mice that have a podocyte-specific inability to incorporate Sec into proteins (denoted in this paper as PodoTrsp-/-) and control mice were made diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, or were injected with vehicle. Blood glucose, body weight, microalbuminuria, glomerular mesangial matrix expansion, and immunohistochemical markers of oxidative stress were assessed.
After 3 and 6 months of diabetes, control and PodoTrsp-/- mice had similar levels of blood glucose. There were no differences in urinary albumin/creatinine ratios. Periodic acid-Schiff staining to examine mesangial matrix expansion also demonstrated no difference between control and PodoTrsp-/- mice after 6 months of diabetes, and there were no differences in immunohistochemical stainings for nitrotyrosine or NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1.
Loss of podocyte selenoproteins in streptozotocin diabetic C57BL/6 mice does not lead to increased oxidative stress as assessed by nitrotyrosine and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 immunostaining, nor does it lead to worsening nephropathy.
Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a complication of shingles (herpes zoster), a painful rash due to varicella-zoster virus reactivation. Studies of patients with PHN and zoster sine herpete (radicular pain without rash) support the notion that low-grade viral ganglionitis contributes to pain. If chronic pain reflects active infection, then antiviral therapy may help patients with PHN.
To determine whether antiviral treatment helps reduce PHN-associated pain.
Prospective, open-label phase I/II clinical trial.
Tertiary care university hospital.
Fifteen patients with moderate to severe PHN.
Intravenous acyclovir at a dosage of 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14 days followed by oral valacyclovir at a dosage of 1000 mg 3 times per day for 1 month.
Numeric Rating Scale for Pain score.
As defined by a decrease of 2 or more points on the Numeric Rating Scale for Pain, 8 (53%) of 15 patients reported improvement.
Clinical improvement reported by most of our patients warrants further investigation in a larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
To determine whether six days recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in an abstinent anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) group had any cardiovascular and biochemical effects compared with a control group.
Male subjects (n=48) were randomly divided, using a single blind procedure into two groups: (1) control group (C) n=24, mean+/-SD, age 32+/-11 years; height 1.8+/-0.06m; (2) rhGH using group (0.058IUkg(-1)day(-1)) (GH) n=24, mean+/-SD, age 32+/-9 years; height 1.8+/-0.07m. Physiological responses, anthropometry, arterial pulse wave velocity (APWV), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), peak oxygen uptake (VO(2) peak) and biochemical indices were investigated.
Body mass index, fat-free mass index and VO(2) peak significantly increased while body fat significantly decreased within GH (all P<0.017). Insulin like growth factor-I significantly increased within GH (P<0.017) and compared with C (P<0.05). Serum sodium significantly increased (P<0.017) and serum homocysteine, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, thyroid stimulating hormone and tetra-iodothyronine (T(4)), significantly decreased within GH (all P<0.017). T(4) significantly decreased compared with C (P<0.05). Arterial pulse wave velocity, peak and recovery systolic and diastolic BP, significantly decreased compared with C (P<0.05). Resting HR and rate pressure product (RPP) significantly increased compared with C (P<0.05).
The findings of this study suggest that short term use of rhGH may have beneficial effects on endothelial function and specific inflammatory markers of cardiovascular disease in abstinent AAS users, but may have an adverse effect on the cardiovascular system, as evidenced by the increase in resting RPP.
The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of 10 ppm sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) exposure on visual evoked potentials (VEPs), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and the activities of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) in diabetes mellitus. Forty healthy male albino rats, aged 3 months, were divided into four equal groups: control (C), sulfur dioxide + control (CSO(2)), diabetic (D), and sulfur dioxide + diabetic (DSO(2)) groups. Experimental diabetes mellitus was induced by IV injection of alloxane monohydrate in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Ten ppm sulfur dioxide was administered to the animals of sulfur dioxide-exposed groups in an exposure chamber for 1 h/day x 7 days/week x 6 weeks while control and diabetic groups were exposed to filtered air in the same condition. SO(2) exposure, though markedly decreasing retina CAT and GSH-Px activities, significantly increased retina Cu,Zn-SOD activity in the diabetic and nondiabetic groups. In contrast to SO(2)-related increase in the activity of Cu,Zn-SOD, decrease in GSH-Px activity was observed in the brain of those groups. Brain CAT activity was unaltered. SO(2) exposure caused the significant elevation in brain TBARS levels of CSO(2) and DSO(2) groups, whereas only in the retina TBARS level of the CSO(2) group. SO(2) exposure caused the significant prolongations of P(1), N(1), P(2), and P(3) components of VEPs in the nondiabetic and all components of VEPs in the diabetic groups. SO(2) exposure also resulted in significant amplitude reductions in both experimental groups.
Exposure of humans to arsenic is associated with various adverse health effects including immunotoxicity and elevated risk of cancer development. Specific mechanisms of these effects are not well understood. In the present study we investigated some functional parameters of peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice exposed for 12 weeks to sodium arsenate in drinking water at 0.5, 5, and 50 mgAs/l. The experimental conditions were matched with the environmental conditions of arsenic exposure in humans. To characterize function of the macrophages, we assessed their ability to release nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in response to common stimulants. To this end the isolated cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (1 microg/ml) to assess NO and TNF-alpha production (the WEHI-164 bioassay) or with phorbol myristate acetate (5 microg/ml) to assess superoxide production (NBT reduction test). As a result, in mice exposed to 0.5, 5, and 50 mgAs/l we observed decreased production of NO (9 +/- 2, 8 +/- 2, 11 +/- 5 microM NO2-, respectively, versus 27 +/- 7 microM in control) and superoxide (41.3 +/- 18.2%, 52.8 +/- 15.1% and 55.9 +/- 12.9%, respectively, less than in control). Despite reduced NO production, expression of iNOS mRNA in RT-PCR, showed similar levels in exposed and control animals. We did not see any significant influence of the exposure on TNF-alpha release and mRNA expression. The potential consequences of decreased production of NO and superoxide by peritoneal macrophages as observed in exposed mice may suggest impaired response of the cells against infection or developing tumor cells.
To test the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of extended-release niacin monotherapy on dyslipidemia in persons with chronic tetraplegia.
Placebo-controlled, blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.
Three spinal cord injury research/rehabilitation centers.
Persons with chronic tetraplegia (N=54) and low plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.
Extended-release niacin monotherapy (48 weeks; n=31) on a dose-titration schedule versus matched placebo (n=23).
Safety was assessed by using percentages of treatment-emergent adverse events and increased levels of hepatic transaminases, uric acid, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fasting glucose. Tolerance was assessed by using participant reports for frequency and intensity of adverse effects of extended-release niacin. Primary effectiveness outcomes were fasting HDL-C level and plasma total cholesterol (TC)/HDL-C ratio. Secondary outcomes included plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and TC levels and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio.
Significant increases in fasting HDL-C levels (24.5%) were accompanied by decreases in TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios, LDL-C levels, and TC levels (all P<.05). No evidence of sustained hepatotoxicity or hyperglycemia was observed. Treatment-emergent withdrawals (12.9%) accompanied flushing (n=1), hypotension/presyncope (n=1), and diarrhea (n=2). One subject experienced transient hyperuricemia. Other drug-reported symptoms did not differ from those for placebo.
Extended-release niacin monotherapy is safe, tolerated, and effective for most persons with chronic tetraplegia. Special precautions for changes in bowel habits and postadministration hypotension should be observed.
NKCC1 and KCC2 are encoded by slc12 gene family and involved in the maintenance of intracellular chloride concentration which may be associated with epileptogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the long-term expression profiles of NKCC1 and KCC2 in CA1 region in the mice model of lithium-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus (PISE) and their relationship with epileptogenesis. We found NKCC1 mRNA and proteins were up-regulated at 1 d, 14 d and 45 d after pilocarpine injection, while KCC2 was down-regulated. According to obtained results, there were some expressional changes of NKCC1 and KCC2. Deregulation of their expression may break the balance of intracellular and extracellular chloride concentration which contributes to the mechanism of hyperexcitability leading to seizures. Also it may provide new drug targets for development of new antiepileptic medicine.
Subcutaneous administration of amylin (20-40 micrograms/kg) prevented, in a dose-dependent manner, reserpine- and serotonin-induced gastric damage, but the anti-ulcer effect was not present when lesions were induced by pylorus ligation. The protective effect of amylin was inhibited by pretreatment with capsicin as well as CGRP-(8-37), a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and amylin receptor antagonist, and was significantly reduced by domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, or neostigmine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Our data suggest that the gastroprotective activity of amylin in some experimental models of gastric ulcers involves capsaicin-sensitive fibers and CGRP receptors. Moreover, the peptide interferes, at least in part, with the dopaminergic and parasympathetic systems.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid and very sensitive method to detect viral genomes. In the present study, the efficacy of immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) of high-risk infants was evaluated by PCR. Twenty-nine infants born to 24 HBeAg-positive carrier mothers were given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) at birth and thereafter received repeated inoculations of plasma-derived vaccine or HBIG, or both, within 1 year. Serum samples at 1 year following immunization were stored at -40 degrees C for later analysis using PCR to detect HBV-DNA. When HBV genomes were detected in infants, the DNA sequences in the S gene of HBV were determined. Of 29 infants, 2 were positive for HBV-DNA at the 1 year following immunization; one had the HBV containing only the wild-type sequence in the S gene and became negative for HBV-DNA during the follow-up period. In contrast, another had the HBV, which contained nucleotide substitutions that altered the expression of the common group-specific determinant "a" of the S gene and resulted in clinical hepatitis with viral persistence. PCR analysis suggests that immunization against HBV prevents effectively high-risk infants from mother-to-child transmission. Even then, however, it is possible that amino acid substitutions in the "a" determinant of the S gene are associated with failure of conventional immunization against HBV.
Experimental manipulations suggest that in vivo administration of exogenous antioxidants agents decreases the concentration of free radical in the brain. Neurochemical studies have proposed a role for catalase in brain mechanisms responsible by development to status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine. The present study was aimed at was investigating the changes in catalase activities after pilocarpine-induced SE. Animals were treated with vitamin E (VIT E) 200 mg/kg (intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and, 30 min later, they received pilocarpine hydrochloride, 400 mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.) (P400). Other three groups received VIT E (200 mg/kg, i.p.), pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, s.c.) or 0.9% NaCl (control) alone. Animals were closely observed for behavioral changes, tremors, stereotyped movements, seizures, SE and death, for 24 h following the pilocarpine injection. The brains were dissected after decapitation. The results have shown that pilocarpine administration and resulting SE produced a significant increase in hippocampal catalase activity of (88%). In the group pre-treated which VIT E in hippocampal catalase activity was increase of 67% and 214% when compared with P400 and control group, respectively. Our results demonstrated a direct evidence of an increase in the activity of the hippocampal catalase of rat adults during seizure activity and after the pre-treated which VIT E that could be responsible by regulation of free radical levels during the establishment of SE.
Ten patients with severe primary pulmonary hypertension and pronounced disability who were unresponsive to oral vasodilators were treated with intravenous epoprostenol (prostacyclin). All had been referred for heart and lung transplantation. Short term administration of epoprostenol (mean dose 5.5 ng/kg/min) increased the mean cardiac index from 1.8 to 2.2 1/min/m2, improved pulmonary artery oxygen saturation from 48% to 57%, and increased calculated tissue oxygen delivery from 10 to 11.8 ml/kg/min. The mean pulmonary vascular resistance fell by 18% while mean systemic artery pressure fell by 32%. Pulmonary artery pressure rose in only two patients. Continued intravenous infusion of epoprostenol for 1-25 months was associated with subjective and clinical improvement. Exercise tolerance improved as measured by an increase in the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during progressive exercise testing. In those six patients who were able to exercise before treatment it rose from a mean of 7 to 15 ml/kg/min. Those who had been unable to exercise before treatment achieved comparable rates of oxygen consumption after treatment. Two patients died on treatment, three have undergone heart-lung transplantation, and in five the treatment is continuing. Complications included episodes of septicaemia and ascites. In this uncontrolled study of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension epoprostenol seemed to offer a means of optimally dosing the patients with a vasodilator to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and thus increasing cardiac output and oxygen tissue delivery. There was no evidence to suggest that this treatment influenced the progress of the disease.
Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured at baseline in 4021 men and 503 women (myocardial infarction survivors) participating in the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study (AMIS). A cohort of participants (1824 men and 226 women) had, in addition, a determination of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and an estimate of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In comparison with values obtained for normal Americans by the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study Group, AMIS participants had higher serum cholesterol, higher serum triglyceride, higher LDL cholesterol, and lower HDL cholesterol levels. These values were the most disparate in the women and younger men. The serum total cholesterol, the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol, and the serum triglyceride level were significantly related (p less than 0.05) to the 3-year cardiovascular mortality rate for men less than 55 years of age (univariate relationships). For men older than 55 years, these relationships were not statistically significant. After adjustment for multiple risk factors, serum cholesterol and the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol remained significant risk factors for cardiovascular death and the combined incidence of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in men less than age 55 years.
New anticoagulants are under development to improve on current ones that, although effective, have limitations in efficacy, safety and convenience. We have reviewed the use of these agents as thromboprophylactic drugs. These new agents have more specific modes of action and can be divided into three groups. Inhibitors of the initiation of coagulation work via inhibition of the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex. Inhibitors of propagation of coagulation include parenteral and oral factor Xa inhibitors, factor IXa inhibitors, inhibitors of factor Va and VIIIa, activated Protein C, soluble thrombomodulin and SNAC-Heparin. Finally, direct inhibitors of thrombin are under development both for parenteral and oral administration. Several new drugs, such as fondaparinux, hirudin, argatroban, bivalirudin and ximelagatran, have already been licensed for specific indications and are being investigated for more general usage. Other drugs reviewed are in much earlier stages of development.
Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide (IFO) and putatively responsible for renal damage following anti-tumor therapy with IFO. Depletion of sulfhydryl (SH) groups has been reported from cell culture, animal and clinical studies. In this work the effect of CAA on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture (hRPTEC) was investigated. Toxicity of CAA was determined by protein content, cell number, LDH release, trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity. Free thiols were measured by the method of Ellman. CAA reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein, induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers. CAA but not acrolein inhibited the cysteine proteases caspase-3, caspase-8 and cathepsin B. Caspase activation by cisplatin was inhibited by CAA. In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage. The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate. Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells. Thus, CAA directly reacts with cellular protein and non-protein thiols, mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC. This effect can be reduced by acidification. Therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent IFO nephropathy in patients.
DYT1 dystonia is an inherited disease linked to mutation in the TOR1A gene encoding for the protein torsinA. Although the mechanism by which this genetic alteration leads to dystonia is unclear, multiple lines of clinical evidence suggest a link between dystonia and a reduced dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) availability. Based on this evidence, herein we carried out a comprehensive analysis of electrophysiological, behavioral and signaling correlates of D2R transmission in transgenic mice with the DYT1 dystonia mutation. Electrophysiological recordings from nigral dopaminergic neurons showed a normal responsiveness to D2-autoreceptor function. Conversely, postsynaptic D2R function in hMT mice was impaired, as suggested by the inability of a D2R agonist to re-establish normal corticostriatal synaptic plasticity and supported by the reduced sensitivity to haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Although an in situ hybridization analysis showed normal D1R and D2R mRNA expression levels in the striata of hMT mice, we found a significant decrease of D2R protein, coupled to a reduced ability of D2Rs to activate their cognate Go/i proteins. Of relevance, we found that pharmacological blockade of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) fully restored the impairment of synaptic plasticity observed in hMT mice. Together, our findings demonstrate an important link between torsinA mutation and D2R dysfunction and suggest that A2AR antagonism is able to counteract the deficit in D2R-mediated transmission observed in mutant mice, opening new perspectives for the treatment of this movement disorder.
A parotid fistula is a rare, extremely unpleasant disease. Patients with chronic pathologies of the facial soft tissues have a high complication rate after aggressive treatments. Alternative conservative treatments have recently been reported for this condition. The case is described of a parotid fistula following a face-lift in a patient affected by facial siliconomas. A 41-year-old Caucasian who had undergone repeated facial silicone injections developed a diffuse granulomatous reaction accompanied by facial disfigurement. Thirteen surgical operations were performed to remove the siliconomas and correct the deformities, the last of which was a face-lift. After this procedure, the patient developed a parotid fistula. Conservative treatment, consisting of a combination of transdermal scopolamine and botulinum toxin A injections, was adopted. These antisialogogues gradually reduced saliva secretion, thereby preparing the wound bed for a skin graft and eventual healing. The choice of conservative therapy, as opposed to a surgical approach, was made to avoid further risks in what was already a highly complicated condition. The use of this conservative approach is recommended to treat complicated cases of parotid fistula.
Severe aplastic anemia is a well-recognized complication of ticlopidine therapy that carries a high mortality. Therapy with colony-stimulating factors or corticosteroids has been largely ineffective in this disorder. We report a case of ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia that was successfully treated with cyclosporine and high-dose dexamethasone. The patient rapidly responded to immunosuppressive therapy and had a normal hemogram after cessation of immunosuppression. On long-term follow-up, the patient developed a progressive macrocytic anemia. Repeat bone marrow evaluation demonstrated myelodysplasia with erythroid hypoplasia. An associated chromosomal abnormality consisting of a t(3;16) (q21; p13.3) translocation was detected. This is the first report of a chromosomal abnormality associated with ticlopidine induced marrow aplastic anemia.
Serial abdominal ultrasonography was performed in 37 children being treated with ceftriaxone for serious infections. Biliary concrements developed in 16 patients, causing symptoms in 3, one of whom also had urolithiasis with renal colic and obstructive ureteropyelectasia. After cessation of ceftriaxone treatment, ultrasound abnormalities and symptoms gradually disappeared, with complete sonographic resolution after 2 to 63 days.
Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common early childhood infections, resulting in an enormous economic burden to the health care system through unscheduled doctor visits and antibiotic prescriptions.
The objective of this study was to investigate the potential association between ambient air pollution exposure and emergency department (ED) visits for OM.
Ten years of ED data were obtained from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and linked to levels of air pollution: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter (PM) of median aerometric diameter < or = 10 and 2.5 pm (PM10 and PM2.5 respectively). A time-stratified case-crossover technique was applied to analyze the associations between ambient air pollution and health outcomes. Conditional logistic regression analysis with the subject's identification number as a stratum variable was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals after adjustment for meteorological factors.
We based the analysis on 14,527 ED visits for OM over 10 years in children 1-3 years of age. We observed statistically significant positive associations between ED visits for OM and interquartile increases in CO and NO2 levels after adjusting for ambient temperature and relative humidity. We observed the strongest associations (expressed by ORs) in the warmer months (April-September) in girls and all patients for exposure to CO and NO2, and in boys for exposure to CO, for 2 days before an OM ED visit.
These results support the hypothesis that ED visits for OM are associated with ambient air pollution.
Urotoxicity is one of the major problems associated with cyclophosphamide (CP) chemotherapy in cancer patients. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant and reduces CP-induced urotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms of protection offered by melatonin are not yet clear. The present study investigated the role of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) on melatonin-mediated protection against CP-induced urotoxicity. CP was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 150 mg/kg to induce urotoxicity in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Melatonin treatment (10 mg/kg) was initiated 3 days before and continued for 1 day after the CP administration. Melatonin treatment reduced the CP-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in the urinary bladder as observed by abrogation in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and glutathione levels as well as comet and modified comet assay parameters. Melatonin treatment reduced the bladder damage and apoptosis as observed by histological analysis and TUNEL assay. Melatonin increased the expression of transcription factor Nrf2 as well as associated phase-II enzymes NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase-1 and heme oxygenase-1. Further melatonin treatment reduced the expression of transcription factor NF-kappaB. The results of the present study provide evidence that melatonin treatment favorably alters Nrf2 and NF-kappaB expression and, this appears to be at least in part responsible for observed protection against CP-induced urotoxicity.
The approximate incidence of indinavir urolithiasis in HIV positive patients receiving the drug is 10%. The exact mechanism of lithogenesis is still unknown. Pure indinavir stones are radiolucent on plane abdominal X-ray or CT scan. Indinavir urolithiasis can be associated with acute unilateral renal colic or severe azotaemia.
20 HIV patients were treated conservatively by increasing oral fluid intake (urine production of 2 l/day and more), discontinuation of indinavir therapy for 1 week and acidification of urine with l-methionin (urine pH 5,3-5,8). Some patients were additionally treated with endoscopic procedures.
In all patients renal function normalized. Increase of oral fluid intake, especially during the first 2 hours after intake of indinavir and during night prevented recurrence of indinavir urolithiasis.
HIV positive patients with renal colic or renal insufficiency and roentgenological absence of radio-opaque stone formations should make the urologist consider indinavir urolithiasis as a possible diagnosis.
There are long-standing concerns about adverse effects of gas appliances on respiratory health. However, the potential adverse effect of low-NOx (nitrogen oxide) unflued gas heaters on children's health has not been assessed.
Our goal was to compare the respiratory health effects and air quality consequences of exposure to low-NOx unflued gas heaters with exposure to non-indoor-air-emitting flued gas heaters in school classrooms.
We conducted a double-blind, cluster-randomized, crossover study in 400 primary school students attending 22 schools in New South Wales, Australia. Children measured their lung function and recorded symptoms and medication use twice daily. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde concentrations were measured in classrooms using passive diffusion badges.
NO2 concentrations were, on average, 1.8 times higher [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-2.1] and formaldehyde concentrations were, on average, 9.4 ppb higher (95% CI, 5.7-13.1) during exposure to unflued gas versus flued gas heaters. Exposure to the unflued gas heaters was associated with increased cough reported in the evening [odds ratio (OR) = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34] and wheeze reported in the morning (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.04-1.83). The association with wheeze was greater in atopic subjects. There was no evidence of an adverse effect on lung function.
We conclude that classroom exposure to low-NOx unflued gas heaters causes increased respiratory symptoms, particularly in atopic children, but is not associated with significant decrements in lung function. It is important to seek alternative sources of heating that do not have adverse effects on health.
The progression of diabetic nephropathy can be positively influenced by maintaining a low blood pressure level. This has been shown in studies with conventional antihypertensive treatment as well as with ACE inhibitors. Whether the latter group of drugs is more effective remains to be proven and was the aim of our study. In a prospective randomized study we compared the effects of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade on retarding progression of renal function in IDDM patients with an early stage of overt diabetic nephropathy. Twenty-nine patients were studied for 2 years, 15 were randomized for treatment with captopril and 14 for atenolol. Every 6 weeks blood pressure and urinary albumin and total protein excretion were measured. GFR was measured every 6 months as 51Cr-EDTA clearance. Baseline values for blood pressure, renal function and albuminuria were identical in the two groups. The effect of both drugs on blood pressure was not significantly different. In the captopril-treated patients MAP before and after 2 years was 110 +/- 3 (SEM) and 100 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively and in the atenolol-treated patients 105 +/- 2 vs 101 +/- 2 mm Hg. Both drugs reduced albuminuria and total proteinuria to the same extent. With captopril albuminuria decreased from 1549 (989-2399) to 851 (537-1380) mg/24 h and proteinuria from 2.5 (1.6-3.8) to 1.2 (0.8-1.8) g/24 h. With atenolol albuminuria decreased from 933 (603-1445) to 676 (437-1047) mg/24 h and proteinuria from 1.5 (1.0-2.4) to 0.9 (0.6-1.5) g/24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecological cancer with a very poor prognosis. Xenograft mouse models have proven to be one very useful tool in testing candidate therapeutic agents and gene function in vivo. In this study we identify genes and gene networks important for the efficacy of a pre-clinical anti-tumor therapeutic, MT19c.
In order to understand how ovarian xenograft tumors may be growing and responding to anti-tumor therapeutics, we used genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA copy number measurements to identify key genes and pathways that may be critical for SKOV-3 xenograft tumor progression. We compared SKOV-3 xenografts treated with the ergocalciferol derived, MT19c, to untreated tumors collected at multiple time points. Cell viability assays were used to test the function of the PPARγ agonist, Rosiglitazone, on SKOV-3 cell growth.
These data indicate that a number of known survival and growth pathways including Notch signaling and general apoptosis factors are differentially expressed in treated vs. untreated xenografts. As tumors grow, cell cycle and DNA replication genes show increased expression, consistent with faster growth. The steroid nuclear receptor, PPARγ, was significantly up-regulated in MT19c treated xenografts. Surprisingly, stimulation of PPARγ with Rosiglitazone reduced the efficacy of MT19c and cisplatin suggesting that PPARγ is regulating a survival pathway in SKOV-3 cells. To identify which genes may be important for tumor growth and treatment response, we observed that MT19c down-regulates some high copy number genes and stimulates expression of some low copy number genes suggesting that these genes are particularly important for SKOV-3 xenograft growth and survival.
We have characterized the time dependent responses of ovarian xenograft tumors to the vitamin D analog, MT19c. Our results suggest that PPARγ promotes survival for some ovarian tumor cells. We propose that a combination of regulated expression and copy number can identify genes that are likely important for chemotherapy response. Our findings suggest a new approach to identify candidate genes that are critical for anti-tumor therapy.
Although several epidemiologic studies show an association between arsenic exposure and prostate cancer, it is still unknown whether human prostate epithelial cells are directly susceptible to arsenic-induced transformation. This study was designed to determine whether the nontumorigenic human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 could be malignantly transformed in vitro by arsenite. RWPE-1 cells were continuously exposed to 5 micro M arsenite and monitored for signs of transformation, assessed as changes in matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels. After 29 weeks of exposure, the arsenite-exposed RWPE-1 cells (referred to as CAsE-PE) showed a marked increase in matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion, a common finding in prostate malignancies. Malignant transformation was confirmed when CAsE-PE cells produced aggressive undifferentiated malignant epithelial tumors in nude mice. The tumors stained positive for human prostate-specific antigen, confirming their origin. These results are the first report of arsenite-induced malignant transformation of a human epithelial cell line and provide an important in vitro model for studying the mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced carcinogenesis in humans.
There is much concern about potential neurodevelopmental impairment after neonatal corticosteroid treatment for chronic lung disease. Dexamethasone is the corticosteroid most often used in this clinical setting, and it has been shown to impair cortical growth among preterm infants. This study evaluated long-term effects of prematurity itself and of neonatal hydrocortisone treatment on structural and functional brain development using three-dimensional MRI with advanced image-processing and neurocognitive assessments.
Sixty children born preterm, including 25 children treated with hydrocortisone and 35 children not treated with hydrocortisone, and 21 children born at term were evaluated, at a mean age of 8 years, with quantitative MRI and neurocognitive assessments (Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Revised [WISC-R]). Automatic image segmentation was used to determine the tissue volumes of cerebral gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, the volume of the hippocampus was determined manually. WISC-R scores were recorded as mean intelligence scores at evaluation. Neonatal hydrocortisone treatment for chronic lung disease consisted of a starting dose of 5 mg/kg per day tapered over a minimum of 3 weeks.
Cerebral gray matter volume was reduced among preterm children (regardless of hydrocortisone treatment), compared with children born at term (preterm: 649 +/- 4.4 mL; term: 666 +/- 7.3 mL). Birth weight was shown to correlate with gray matter volume at 8 years of age in the preterm group (r = 0.421). Cerebrospinal fluid volume was increased among children born preterm, compared with children born at term (preterm: 228 +/- 4.9 mL; term: 206 +/- 8.2 mL). Total hippocampal volume tended to be lower among children born preterm, with a more pronounced reduction of hippocampal volume among boys (preterm: 6.1 +/- 0.13 mL; term: 6.56 +/- 0.2 mL). The WISC-R score was lower for children born preterm, compared with children born at term (preterm: 99.4 +/- 12.4; term: 109.6 +/- 8.8). Children treated with neonatal hydrocortisone had very similar volumes of gray matter (preterm with hydrocortisone: 650 +/- 7.0 mL; preterm without hydrocortisone: 640 +/- 5.6 mL), white matter (preterm with hydrocortisone: 503 +/- 6.1 mL; preterm without hydrocortisone: 510 +/- 4.9 mL), and cerebrospinal fluid (preterm with hydrocortisone: 227 +/- 7.4 mL; preterm without hydrocortisone: 224 +/- 6.0 mL), compared with untreated infants. The hippocampal volumes were similar in the 2 groups (preterm with hydrocortisone: 5.92 +/- 0.15 mL; preterm without hydrocortisone: 5.81 +/- 0.12 mL). The WISC-R score assessments were within the normal range for both groups, with no difference between the groups (preterm with hydrocortisone: 100.8 +/- 13; preterm without hydrocortisone: 98.6 +/- 12.3).
Prematurity is associated with mild brain structural differences that persist at 8 years of age, with associated lower scores in neurocognitive assessments. The data suggest that perinatal hydrocortisone given at the described dosage has no long-term effects on either neurostructural brain development or neurocognitive outcomes.
