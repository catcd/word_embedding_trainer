The present study was designed to examine the effects of the inhibition or induction of CYP2E1 activity on acute acrylonitrile (AN) toxicity in rats. Increased or decreased hepatic CYP2E1 activity was achieved by pretreatment with acetone or trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (DCE), respectively. AN (50 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection. Onset of convulsions and death were observed in rats with increased CYP2E1 activity, whereas convulsions and death did not appear in rats within 1 h after treatment with AN alone. Convulsions occurred in all AN-treated animals with increased CYP2E1 activity at approximately 18 min. The levels of cyanide (CN(-)), a terminal metabolite of AN, were significantly increased in the brains and livers of the AN-treated rats with increased CYP2E1 activity, compared with the levels in rats treated with AN alone, DCE + AN or acetone + DCE + AN. The cytochrome c oxidase (CcOx) activities in the brains and livers of the rats treated with AN or AN + acetone were significantly lower than those in the normal control rats and the rats treated with DCE, whereas the CcOx activities in the brains and livers of rats with decreased CYP2E1 activity were significantly higher than those in AN-treated rats. Brain lipid peroxidation was enhanced, and the antioxidant capacity was significantly compromised in rats with decreased CYP2E1 activity compared with rats with normal or increased CYP2E1 activity. Therefore, inhibition of CYP2E1 and simultaneous antioxidant therapy should be considered as supplementary therapeutic interventions in acute AN intoxication cases with higher CYP2E1 activity, thus a longer window of opportunity would be got to offer further emergency medication.
Seven highly purified degradation products of penicillin G (PG) were examined with regard to their ability to cross-react allergically with PG. Guinea pig allergic contact dermatitis was employed as the test system. Three of these degradation products, D-benzylpenicillenic acid (BPE), D-penicillamine, and D-alpha-benzylpenicilloic acid were found to cross-react with PG and also to be capable of inducing delayed contact allergy in the guinea pig. BPE and PG cross-reacted with particularly intense reactions, and other immunologic experiments indicated that PG and BPE introduce identical allergic determinant groups into epidermal proteins. These experimental results were correlated with the results of previous studies concerning the degradation pathways of PG under physiological conditions in vitro, and the chemical reactivities of these degradation products. Based on these immunologic and chemical data, a schema is proposed which suggests the chemical pathways by which PG may react with epidermal proteins in vivo to form the penicillin antigen. The identity of the specific antigenic determinant groups of the penicillin antigen is suggested. The relationship between PG allergy of the contact dermatitis type in the guinea pig and PG allergy of the immediate type in man is discussed.
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients may complain of unsteadiness and impaired balance not only when OFF, but also while being ON with levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), yet influence of LID upon postural stability has not been specifically examined. In this study, we addressed this issue using static and dynamic posturography in patients with advanced PD and typical LID. Relevant postural stability parameters were measured on force platforms when patients were OFF and ON, either in quiet standing or when performing leaning tasks designed to stress postural stability. Simultaneously, LID was assessed clinically using a dyskinesia rating scale of severity and subjective unsteadiness was computed. Displacement of the net center of pressure (COPnet), range of COPnet in the mediolateral and antero-posterior directions and 95% confidence ellipse area for both feet were measured as indicators of postural stability and used for comparison analyses. We found a significant increase of COPnet displacement in all tasks up to 556% (mean: 125+/-165%) when patients were ON with dyskinesia compared to the OFF state. In about half of the patients, this increase was marked and correlated with subjective unsteadiness while ON. There was a good correlation between the clinical scores of dyskinesia severity and most COPnet values. Patients demonstrated a tendency to sustain their weight on the foot less affected by dyskinesia, probably as a compensatory mechanism. Our results suggest that LID may compromise balance and independently contribute to postural instability in advanced PD.
PF1, an anti-inflammatory drug candidate, was nephrotoxic in cynomolgus monkeys in a manner that was qualitatively comparable to that observed with the two previous exploratory drug candidates (PF2and PF3). Based on the severity of nephrotoxicity, PF1 ranked between the other two compounds, withPF2 inducing mortality at all doses and PF3 eliciting only mild nephrotoxicity. To further characterize nephrotoxicity in monkeys and enable direct comparisons with humans, primary cultures of proximal tubular (PT) cells from monkey and human kidneys were used as in vitro tools, using lactate dehydrogenase release as the biomarker of cytotoxicity. In both human and monkey PT cells, PF2was by far the most cytotoxic compound of the three drugs. PF1 exhibited modest cytotoxicity at the highest concentration tested in human PT cells but none in monkey kidney cells whereas PF3 exhibited the reverse pattern.Because these drugs are organic anions, mechanistic studies using human organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (hOAT1 andhOAT3) transfected cell lines were pursued to evaluate the potential of these compounds to interact with these transporters. All three drugs exhibited high affinity for hOAT3 (PF1 exhibited the lowest IC50 of 6M) but only weakly interacted with hOAT1 (with no interaction found for PF2). PF2 was a strong hOAT3 (not hOAT1) substrate, whereas PF1 and PF3 were substrates for both hOAT1 and hOAT3.Upon pretreatment of monkeys with the OAT substrate probenecid, PF3 systemic exposure (AUC) and half-life (t1/2) increased approximately 2-fold whereas clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vdss) decreased, as compared to naïve monkeys. This indicated that PF3 competed with probenecid for hOAT1 and/or hOAT3mediated elimination of PF3. Thus, hOAT1 and/or hOAT3 may be responsible for the uptake of this series of drugs in renal PT cells, which may directly or indirectly lead to the observed nephrotoxicity in vivo.
The clinical use of arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), a potent antineoplastic agent, is limited by its severe cardiotoxic effects. QT interval prolongation and apoptosis have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of As(2)O(3). The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis and cardiac injury.
In a mouse model of As(2)O(3)-induced cardiomyopathy in vivo, QT intervals and plasma enzyme activities were measured; cardiac tissues were examined histologically and apoptosis assessed. In H9c2 cardiomyocyte cells, viability, apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular calcium levels were measured.
In the mouse model, resveratrol reduced As(2)O(3)-induced QT interval prolongation and cardiomyocyte injury (apoptosis, myofibrillar loss and vacuolization). In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase activity and decreased activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase were observed in the plasma of As(2)O(3)-treated mice; these changes were prevented by pretreatment with resveratrol. In As(2)O(3)-treated H9c2 cardiomyocytes, resveratrol significantly increased cardiomyocyte viability and attenuated cell apoptosis as measured by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay and caspase-3 activity. As(2)O(3)-induced generation of ROS and intracellular calcium mobilization in H9c2 cells was also suppressed by pretreatment with resveratrol.
Our results showed that resveratrol significantly attenuated As(2)O(3)-induced QT prolongation, structural abnormalities and oxidative damage in the heart. In H9c2 cardiomyocytes, resveratrol also decreased apoptosis, production of ROS and intracellular calcium mobilization induced by treatment with As(2)O(3). These observations suggested that resveratrol has the potential to protect against cardiotoxicity in As(2)O(3)-exposed patients.
To investigate the effects of Nimesulide, a selective Cox-2 inhibitor, on the apoptosis, invasion and migration of hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (FaDu).
Viabilities of FaDu cells treated with various concentrations of Nimesulide were detected by MTT assay. Morphological changes were observed by acridine orange cytochemistry staining. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The ability of invasion and migration of cells was detected by Transwell chambers. The mRNA and protein expressions of Cox-2, MMP-9 and caspase-3 in response to Nimesulide were examined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively.
MTT assay showed that the cell surviving rates significantly decreased in time- and concentration-dependent manners (P < 0.05). The typical morphological changes of apoptotic cells were observed. Percent of apoptosis after 6 h Nimesulide treatment was (32.4 ± 6.1)%. The metastatic cells were decreased by Nimesulide to about 20%. Nimesulide decreased the expressions of Cox-2 and MMP-9, whereas increased expression the of Caspase-3.
Nimesulide could induce the apoptosis and inhibit metastasis of FaDu cells.
Neutrophil-endothelial adhesion is a crucial step in vascular inflammation and is recognized as a direct cause of serious atherosclerosis-mediated diseases. We previously demonstrated that high concentrations of glucose increased adhesion in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner within 48 h of administration by increasing the surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecules. In this study, we focused on the effects of histamine 2 receptor antagonists on endothelial-neutrophil adhesion and on the surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecules mediated by high glucose levels. Histamine 2 receptor antagonists have pleiotropic effects; they not only block the secretion of gastric acid, but also inhibit cell-cell adhesion, resulting in inhibition of metastasis. However, relevant mechanisms of action are not yet fully understood. Of three histamine 2 receptor antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine), only cimetidine significantly attenuated adhesion mediated by 48-h incubation with 27.8 mM glucose. Cimetidine was found to decrease the surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin, but not E-selectin. To determine the effects of cimetidine on intracellular level, we examined the effects of cimetidine on PKC-induced changes in adhesion, as well as the effects of nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors on cimetidine. We found that NO synthase inhibitors reduced the inhibitory effects of cimetidine, whereas cimetidine did not affect adhesion mediated by a PKC activator. These data suggest that cimetidine acts directly on endothelial cells to inhibit high-glucose-induced expression of adhesion molecules and neutrophil adhesion mediated by increasing endothelial NO production, but not by inhibiting PKC.
The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and the androgen receptor (AR) play important roles in tumor development and progression in prostate carcinogenesis. Among many functions, PTEN negatively regulates the cytoplasmic phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT anti-apoptotic pathway; and nuclear PTEN affects the cell cycle by also negatively regulating the MAPK pathway via cyclin D. Decreased PTEN expression is correlated with prostate cancer progression. Over-expression of AR and upregulation of AR transcriptional activity are often observed in the later stages of prostate cancer. Recent studies indicate that PTEN regulates AR activity and stability. However, the mechanism of how AR regulates PTEN has never been studied. Furthermore, resveratrol, a phytoalexin enriched in red grapes, strawberries and peanuts, has been shown to inhibit AR transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we use prostate cancer cell lines to test the hypothesis that resveratrol inhibits cellular proliferation in both AR-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We show that resveratrol inhibits AR transcriptional activity in both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells. Additionally, resveratrol stimulates PTEN expression through AR inhibition. In contrast, resveratrol directly binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rapidly inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation, resulting in decreased AKT phosphorylation, in an AR-independent manner. Thus, resveratrol may act as potential adjunctive treatment for late-stage hormone refractory prostate cancer. More importantly, for the first time, our study demonstrates the mechanism by which AR regulates PTEN expression at the transcription level, indicating the direct link between a nuclear receptor and the PI3K/AKT pathway.
The biochemical mechanisms by which nitroso-vasodilators cause smooth muscle relaxation remain controversial. One theory states that the effects of nitroso-vasodilators are mediated by increased intracellular levels of cyclic GMP due to activation of guanylate cyclase. To test this hypothesis, the authors examined the effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in anesthetized dogs with an without pretreatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor aminophylline. Aminophylline pretreatment resulted in a 2.8-fold potentiation of the hypotensive effects of a continuous infusion of SNP. Potentiation also was seen for the effects of SNP on stroke volume, heart rate, and plasma cyclic GMP levels. These results support the hypothesis that nitroso-vasodilators exert their effects via guanylate cyclase activation. The authors advise caution when vasodilator therapy with agents such as SNP, nitroglycerin, or hydralazine is instituted in patients receiving aminophylline and when aminophylline is either instituted or discontinued in patients on vasodilator therapy.
FOLFOX6 regimen has been used in treating advanced colorectal cancer for a period, but there is no systemic study on FOLFOX6 regimen in treating Chinese colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis. This study was to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFOX6 regimen on Chinese colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis, and observe the adverse events.
Ninety-one colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis were treated by FOLFOX6 regimen. FOLFOX6 regimen consisted of 2-hour infusion of oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2)) and 2-hour infusion of leucovorin (CF) (400 mg/m(2)) on Day l, followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) bolus (400 mg/m(2)) on Day 1 and 46-hour infusion (2.4 g/m(2)). FOLFOX6 regimen was repeated at 2-week intervals. The clinical efficacy and adverse events were evaluated.
The objective response rate for all patients was 40.7%, with 4 cases of complete remission (CR), 33 partial remission (PR), 19 stable disease (SD), and 35 progressive disease (PD). There was no significant difference in objective response rate between the patients with and without previous treatment (P>0.05). The median survival time was 17.0 months for all patients, 20.0 months for the patients without previous treatment, and 12.0 months for the patients with previous treatment. The time to progress (TTP) was 7.0 months for all patients, 9.0 months for the patients without previous treatment, and 6.0 months for the patients with previous treatment. Peripheral neuritis, gastrointestinal reaction, and myelosuppression were major adverse events. All patients with 5-FU-associated adverse events recovered after treatment.
FOLFOX6 regimen can be used in treating colorectal cancer with liver metastasis for its efficacy and less toxicity.
To identify genes involved in cardiac arrhythmia, we investigated patients with long QT syndrome (LQT), an inherited disorder causing sudden death from a ventricular tachyarrythmia, torsade de pointes. We previously mapped LQT loci on chromosomes 11 (LQT1), 7 (LQT2), and 3 (LQT3). Here, linkage and physical mapping place LQT2 and a putative potassium channel gene, HERG, on chromosome 7q35-36. Single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses reveal HERG mutations in six LQT families, including two intragenic deletions, one splice-donor mutation, and three missense mutations. In one kindred, the mutation arose de novo. Northern blot analyses show that HERG is strongly expressed in the heart. These data indicate that HERG is LQT2 and suggest a likely cellular mechanism for torsade de pointes.
Paranoia is commonly a mood-incongruent psychotic symptom of mania which may be related to dopamine dysregulation. Progesterone and its metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLO) have been found in animals to antagonize the effects of dopamine. We therefore examined serum progesterone, its endogenous antagonist DHEAS and polymorphisms of the genes coding for certain steroidogenetic enzymes (AKR1C4, HSD3B2, and SRD5A1) in 64 males and 96 females with bipolar 1 or 2 disorder with or without paranoid ideation during mood elevation. Euthymic morning serum progesterone, DHEAS and cortisol concentrations were measured in males and in premenopausal women who were in follicular phase and not taking oral contraceptives. In women only, SNPs in AKR1C4 reduced the likelihood of having exhibited paranoid ideation by circa 60%. The haplotype of all 4 SNPs in the AKR1C4 gene reduced the risk of exhibiting paranoia by 80% (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06-0.61, p=0.05). A history of paranoid ideation was not, however, related to progesterone or DHEAS concentration. Serum DHEAS and progesterone concentrations were lower in men who had shown paranoid ideation during mania/hypomania compared with those who had not (F=7.30, p=0.006) however this was not coupled to polymorphisms in the selected genes. The ancestral G in rs4659174 in HSD3B2 was in men associated with a lower risk of paranoid ideation (likelihood ratio χ(2) 3.97, p=0.046, OR 0.31 (95% CI 0.10-0.96)) but did not correlate with hormone concentrations. Hence, gene variants in the steroidogenetic pathway and steroids concentration differences may be involved in the susceptibility to paranoia during mood elevation.
Cognitive and behavioral effects of phenobarbital in toddlers were assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of patients who had had a febrile seizure. There were no significant differences in IQ (Binet or Bayley Scales) between placebo and phenobarbital groups after eight to 12 months of therapy. However, detrimental effects of phenobarbital were found in memory, for which serum level influenced scores, and in comprehension, in that length of treatment time affected performance. Hyperactivity was not seen. Behavioral changes, reported by parents, were increased fussiness and a characteristic disturbance of sleep. These changes varied in severity and were classified as transient, dose related, or unacceptable. After 12 months in the study, most parents could not distinguish between phenobarbital and placebo. Our data suggest that although most toddlers do not have major side effects from phenobarbital therapy when treated for a year, serum levels and length of time on phenobarbital should be kept at a minimum to reduce negative cognitive and behavioral effects.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plays a crucial role in treating breast cancer, but there is no standard regimen. Recently, FEC regimen [5-fluorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin (EPI), plus cyclophosphamide (CTX)] is the most commonly used; gemcitabine (GEM) is also a new active antimetabolite for breast cancer, however, the experience with neoadjuvant gemcitabine is limited. This study was to compare the efficacy of GC regimen and FEC regimen on breast cancer, and observe the adverse events.
From Mar. 2003 to Sep. 2005, 62 patients with stage II-III breast cancer were treated with 2 cycles of either GC regimen or FEC regimen before operation. The 22 patients in GC group received GEM (1000 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1 and Day 8, and DDP (75 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 2. The 40 patients in FEC group received EPI (50 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1, CTX (500 mg/m(2)) by intravenous injection on Day 1 and Day 8, and 5-FU (500 mg/m(2)) by 4-hour continuous infusion on Day 1 and Day 8. Clinical response and adverse events were assessed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
The overall response rate (RR) was 63.6% in GC group and 72.5% in FEC group. After GC therapy, 4 patients showed clinical complete remission (cCR), 2 pathologic complete remission (pCR), 10 partial remission (PR), 8 stable disease (SD)û while after FEC therapy, 9 patients showed cCR, 5 pCR, 20 PR, 10 SD. The most common adverse events were anemia, leukopenia, and nausea/vomiting. More cases of leukopenia were observed in GC group (18/22, P<0.05), and more cases of anemia in FEC group (29/40, P<0.05); the occurrence rates of gastroenteric reaction were similar in both groups. Only 1 patient in GC group suffered from oral mucositis; no renal toxicity and neurotoxicity were observed.
GC and FEC regimens are both effective for breast cancer with tolerable adverse events. The efficacy of FEC regimen is better than that of GT regimen.
The short-term effects of methylphenidate were examined on behavioral, laboratory, academic, and physiological measures in 11 black male adolescents diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder (ADD). In a double-blind, crossover design with randomized order, the subjects received placebo and each of three methylphenidate doses (0.15 mg/kg, 0.30 mg/kg, and 0.50 mg/kg) for a period of 2 weeks per medication dosage. Significant drug effects were found for the majority of measures. In general, the higher doses resulted in the most beneficial response in behavioral, academic, and laboratory measures of attention and impulsivity. However, a significant linear increase occurred in diastolic blood pressure. The results suggest that methylphenidate is an effective adjunct to the treatment of ADD in adolescents.
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is perturbed in many cancers. We tested the hypothesis that coding polymorphisms of the death receptor 4 (DR4), caspase-8 (CASP8), and caspase-10 (CASP10) genes might act as low-penetrance breast cancer genes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes were genotyped in a series of 999 breast cancer case patients and 996 control subjects from Sheffield, U.K., and in a second, independent U.K. population of 2192 case patients and 2262 control subjects from East Anglia. In the Sheffield study, the rare H allele of CASP8, D302H, was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in a dose-dependent manner (P(trend) = .007). Furthermore, the CASP8 D302H association, but not that of the other CASP8 SNPs examined (T21914C, G50121A, and G50358A), was replicated in the East Anglian study. The combined adjusted odds ratios for breast cancer were 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74 to 0.94) for the DH heterozygote and 0.58 (95% CI = 0.39 to 0.88) for the HH homozygote (P(trend) = .0002, adjusted for study). The reproducible, dose-dependent association of CASP8 D302H with breast cancer indicates the potential importance of inherited variation in the apoptosis pathway in breast cancer susceptibility.
Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are suspected of inducing angioedemas in up to 0.2% of all patients. These angioedemas are mainly localized in the upper airways and therefore can cause severe airway obstruction and even death due to suffocation. We report the case of a 64-year-old man, who underwent emergency tracheotomy because of severe angioedema of the larynx, which was refractory to pharmacological treatment. We conclude that patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedemas should be observed by monitoring in an intensive care unit to ensure the possibility of early intubation, because conventional antiallergic-antiedematous therapy by histamine-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids is an insufficient, unreliable form of therapy in severe cases. Especially otolaryngologists should know about this uncommon potentially life-threatening side-effect of ACE inhibitors.
To describe the antihypertensive dose-response of combination therapy with candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT).
Data from 4632 men and women (sex ratio 1:1, mean age 54 years) with mild to moderate hypertension, who participated in one of seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with candesartan-HCT for 8-12 weeks, were entered in a common database. The daily dose of candesartan ranged from 2 to 32 mg, and that of HCT from 6.25 to 25mg. An E(max) model was used to describe the placebo-adjusted dose-response surface for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) reductions.
The BP reduction increased with increasing doses of candesartan and HCT, ranging from 5.9 to 17.4 mmHg systolic, and from 2.8 to 10.2 mmHg diastolic with combination therapy. As these figures represent pure drug effects, the effect observed in placebo treated patients (mean reduction 6.0/5.6 mmHg) should be added to estimate the average BP reduction in the usual clinical setting. The reduction with candesartan-HCT represented fully additive contributions of the components.
The effect of candesartan-HCT is dose-related over a wide range of doses, and the effects of the components are fully additive. This analysis provides guidance for dosing.
This study was undertaken in 102 adult patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (i.v.) midazolam in the setting of bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy (BMAT). Combined local anaesthetic (LA) and sedation was used in 87% of patients and 13% received LA alone. Amnesia occurred in all sedated patients with only 9% experiencing a mild degree of post-procedure pain. This contrasted sharply with the non-sedated group, in whom 85% had intense pain during the biopsy followed by protracted local discomfort in approximately 54%. Drowsiness and some psychomotor impairment were the only notable sedation-related side-effects in approximately 20%. None required assisted ventilation. There was a resounding patient preference for BMAT with sedation. Considering the ease of use, safety and efficacy of i.v. midazolam, the availability of flumazenil as a reversal agent and the undoubted positive effects on quality of life, we would advocate using it in BMAT provided that there were no contraindications.
Amiodarone has a high incidence of side effects, but few pro-arrhythmic effects. We report a case of amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes in a child aged 10 years. The patient had severe dilated cardiomyopathy, and even though he was treated with low oral doses of amiodarone, without dosage increments and electrolyte imbalance, he developed torsade de pointes at nights, after T-wave modification and increases of the corrected QT interval (QTc, 20%), QT dispersion (QTd, 175%) and QTcd (116%). The arrhythmic events were preceded by sinus bradycardia at Holter monitoring. Amiodarone therapy was discontinued. Intravenous magnesium administration was not effective in the suppression of torsade de pointes. High-rate atrial pacing prevented recurrences of the arrhythmias and reduced the QTc interval by 20%, QTd by 50%, and QTcd by 70%; QTd and QTcd returned below normal limits. This case underscores the need of careful electrocardiographic monitoring during amiodarone therapy.
