Three patients who received etretinate, two for psoriasis vulgaris and one for exfoliative dermatitis, developed clinical and electromyographic features of muscle damage during treatment. In one patient histological and ultrastructural findings indicated segmental muscle necrosis. Withdrawal of the drug led to clinical recovery and normalization of muscle enzyme levels and electromyogram. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show etretinate-induced reversible skeletal muscle damage.
The effect of clonidine on a number of behavioural parameters believed to be expressed through central dopaminergic mechanisms has been studied in rodents. 1. Clonidine (0.06-2 mg/kg) potentiated the circling response to standard doses of both apomorphine (0.25 mg/kg) and amphetamine (3 mg/kg) in mice with unilateral destruction of nigro-neostriatal dopamine nerve terminals. Similarly, clonidine (0.06-2 mg/kg) enhanced the locomotor effect of apomorphine in reserpinised mice. 2. Clonidine (0.5 mg/kg) was without effect on the patterns of stereotypyd behaviours induced by the dopamine agonist apomorphine (0.1-5 mg/kg) in the rat. Unilateral intrastriatal injections of clonidine (5-100 microng) caused no discernable behavioural effects in rats. 3. Injection of apomorphine (10 microng) bilaterally into the region of the nucleus accumbens of the rat resulted in a hyperactive response, while bilateral injection of clonidine (50 microng) into this region caused marked sedation, thus mimicking the effects of these drugs on motor activity when administered systemically. Combinations of systemic or nucleus accumbens apomorphine and clonidine resulted in potentiated stereotype and prolonged hyperactivity responses. 4. Clonidine (0.5 mg/kg) potentiated the cataleptic effect of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (0.1-2 mg/kg) in rats. Clonidine therefore potentiated those behavioural responses exhibiting a locomotor component (viz. circling and hyperactivity), but was without effect on stereotypy. The potentiation of catalepsy induced by clonidine may be explained in non-specific sedatory terms. It is apparent that clonidine acts through a secondary neurone system which modifies the effects of dopamine receptor stimulation, although the exact site of this interaction is not clear. The tentative conclusion might be that clonidine inhibits 5-HT neuronal activity, and the possible relationships between 5-HT and NA and dopamine are discussed.
Nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR)-B, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and retinoic acid receptor alpha, have been implicated in breast cancer etiology and progression. We investigated the role of dendritic cell-specific transcript (DC-SCRIPT) as coregulator of these nuclear receptors and as a prognostic factor in breast cancer.
The effect of DC-SCRIPT on the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors was assessed by luciferase reporter assays. DC-SCRIPT expression in normal and tumor tissue from breast cancer patients was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of tumor DC-SCRIPT mRNA expression was assessed in three independent cohorts of breast cancer patients: a discovery group (n = 47) and a validation group (n = 97) (neither of which had received systemic adjuvant therapy) and in a tamoxifen-treated validation group (n = 68) by using a DC-SCRIPT to porphobilinogen deaminase transcript ratio cutoff of 0.15 determined in the discovery group. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model analyses were performed. All statistical tests were two-sided.
DC-SCRIPT suppressed ER- and PR-mediated transcription in a ligand-dependent fashion, whereas it enhanced the retinoic acid receptor alpha- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-mediated transcription. In breast tissue samples from nine patients, DC-SCRIPT mRNA was expressed at lower levels in the tumor than in the corresponding normal tissue (P = .010). Patients in the discovery group with high tumor DC-SCRIPT mRNA levels (66%) had a longer disease-free interval than those with a low DC-SCRIPT mRNA level (34%) (hazard ratio [HR] of recurrence for high vs low DC-SCRIPT level = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06 to 0.93, P = .039), which was confirmed in the validation group (HR of recurrence = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.95, P = .034). This prognostic value was confined to patients with ER- and/or PR-positive tumors (discovery group: HR of recurrence = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.89, P = .030; validation group: HR of recurrence = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.91, P = .028) and was also observed in the second validation group (HR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.97, P = .040). DC-SCRIPT was an independent prognostic factor after correction for tumor size, lymph node status, and adjuvant therapy (n = 145; HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.85, P = .010).
DC-SCRIPT is a key regulator of nuclear receptor activity that has prognostic value in breast cancer.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent available antitumor agent; however, its clinical use is limited because of its cardiotoxicity. Cell death is a key component in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, but its mechanisms are elusive. Here, we explore the role of superoxide, nitric oxide (NO), and peroxynitrite in DOX-induced cell death using both in vivo and in vitro models of cardiotoxicity. Western blot analysis, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, fluorescent microscopy, and biochemical assays were used to determine the markers of apoptosis/necrosis and sources of NO and superoxide and their production. Left ventricular function was measured by a pressure-volume system. We demonstrated increases in myocardial apoptosis (caspase-3 cleavage/activity, cytochrome c release, and TUNEL), inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression, mitochondrial superoxide generation, 3-nitrotyrosine (NT) formation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/MMP-9 gene expression, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation [without major changes in NAD(P)H oxidase isoform 1, NAD(P)H oxidase isoform 2, p22(phox), p40(phox), p47(phox), p67(phox), xanthine oxidase, endothelial NOS, and neuronal NOS expression] and decreases in myocardial contractility, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities 5 days after DOX treatment to mice. All these effects of DOX were markedly attenuated by peroxynitrite scavengers. Doxorubicin dose dependently increased mitochondrial superoxide and NT generation and apoptosis/necrosis in cardiac-derived H9c2 cells. DOX- or peroxynitrite-induced apoptosis/necrosis positively correlated with intracellular NT formation and could be abolished by peroxynitrite scavengers. DOX-induced cell death and NT formation were also attenuated by selective iNOS inhibitors or in iNOS knockout mice. Various NO donors when coadministered with DOX but not alone dramatically enhanced DOX-induced cell death with concomitant increased NT formation. DOX-induced cell death was also attenuated by cell-permeable SOD but not by cell-permeable catalase, the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynine or diphenylene iodonium. Thus, peroxynitrite is a major trigger of DOX-induced cell death both in vivo and in vivo, and the modulation of the pathways leading to its generation or its effective neutralization can be of significant therapeutic benefit.
Genome-wide association studies have identified SNPs within FTO, the human fat mass and obesity-associated gene, that are strongly associated with obesity. Individuals homozygous for the at-risk rs9939609 A allele weigh, on average, ~3 kg more than individuals with the low-risk T allele. Mice that lack FTO function and/or Fto expression display increased energy expenditure and a lean phenotype. We show here that ubiquitous overexpression of Fto leads to a dose-dependent increase in body and fat mass, irrespective of whether mice are fed a standard or a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that increased body mass results primarily from increased food intake. Mice with increased Fto expression on a high-fat diet develop glucose intolerance. This study provides the first direct evidence that increased Fto expression causes obesity in mice.
Pregnant Fischer 344 rats and New Zealand White rabbits were orally administered 0, 5, 15, or 50 mg nitrapyrin/kg/day on Gestation Days 6 through 15 (rats) or 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day on Gestation Days 6 through 18 (rabbits). In rats, 50 mg/kg/day produced slight histopathologic changes in the livers of pregnant females. Fetal examination revealed no evidence of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity among rats at dose levels up to 50 mg/kg/day. Among rabbits, a significant depression in maternal weight gain and increased absolute and relative liver weights were observed at 30 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of crooked hyoid bone among fetal rabbits in the 30 mg/kg/day dose group was considered indicative of fetotoxicity but not teratogenicity. Thus, administration of nitrapyrin was not teratogenic at dose levels up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits.
Leukoencephalopathy is a recognized complication with intrathecal or intravenous methotrexate (MTX). We report a 59-year-old lady who developed MTX leukoencephalopathy with long-term low-dose oral MTX. She developed posterior leukoencephalopathy (PLE) that initially was reversible on discontinuation of oral MTX. Four months later, she developed disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (DNL), and was left with devastating neurological deficits. The sequential conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), MR perfusion (MRP) and MR spectroscopic (MRS) changes are highlighted in this report. MRP and MRS showed more wide spread abnormalities than DWI. Stereotactic biopsy from the lesion revealed demyelination with macrophagic infiltration, pericapillary lymphomononuclear aggregation, fibrinoid changes in the capillaries and neovascularization. Of the two cases of PLE with oral MTX reported in literature, one reversed clinically and radiologically with the discontinuation of MTX. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of DNL following oral MTX in the world literature.
The per-generation mutation rate in humans is high. De novo mutations may compensate for allele loss due to severely reduced fecundity in common neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases, explaining a major paradox in evolutionary genetic theory. Here we used a family based exome sequencing approach to test this de novo mutation hypothesis in ten individuals with unexplained mental retardation. We identified and validated unique non-synonymous de novo mutations in nine genes. Six of these, identified in six different individuals, are likely to be pathogenic based on gene function, evolutionary conservation and mutation impact. Our findings provide strong experimental support for a de novo paradigm for mental retardation. Together with de novo copy number variation, de novo point mutations of large effect could explain the majority of all mental retardation cases in the population.
Myocardial revascularization was performed in 1,361 patients over a 66-month period (February, 1978 to August, 1983) without a single occurrence of late cardiac tamponade. During a subsequent 4-month-period, aspirin and dipyridamole were administered routinely to all coronary bypass patients. The incidence of late cardiac tamponade rose significantly (p less than 0.001) to 3 of 85 patients (3.5%). Routine perioperative administration of aspirin and dipyridamole to patients undergoing myocardial revascularization may be associated with an increased incidence of delayed cardiac tamponade.
Vascular restenosis is one of the major concerns for the management of coronary artery disease using therapeutic vascular procedures. Treatments with thrombin-specific inhibitors, hirudin or hirulog-1, reduced ischemic events in coronary artery disease patients. Early started and prolonged infusions of these thrombin inhibitors partially prevented balloon catheter injury induced restenosis or neointima formation in experimental animal models, but increased the bleeding tendency. Hirulog-like peptide (HLP) was rationally designed to enhance the inhibition of the binding of thrombin to its receptor with less interruption of coagulation activity in comparison to hirulog-1. A single infusion of HLP for 4 h started 0.5 h before balloon catheter injury reduced neointima formation by 36% in rat carotid artery compared to vehicle controls. Tail bleeding time and activated partial thromboplastin time during HLP infusion were not significantly different from vehicle controls, but were significantly shorter than during heparin or hirulog-1 infusion. HLP treatment attenuated the expression of platelet-derived growth factor in the neointima of injured arteries. HLP also inhibited thrombin-induced thymidine incorporation in cultured baboon aortic smooth muscle cells. The findings suggest that HLP may substantially inhibit balloon catheter injury induced neointima formation without noticeable increase in bleeding tendency in rats. The inhibition by HLP of the expression of platelet-derived growth factor and of the smooth muscle cell proliferation in the vascular wall potentially contributes to the preventive effect of the new thrombin inhibitor on injury-induced neointima formation in the vascular wall.
Helicobacter pylori eradication triple therapy with a combination of lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin was approved in Japan in September 2000.
To compare the cost-effectiveness of this eradication therapy with conventional histamine-2 receptor antagonist therapy in Japan.
We established two Markov models for gastric and duodenal ulcers. The model design was based on the Japanese H. pylori eradication guideline and a specialist's opinions, and the model inputs were obtained from a literature review. The models predict the direct medical costs, number of disease-free days and cost per disease-free day for 5 years.
In the gastric ulcer model, the expected total costs of eradication and conventional therapies per patient were yen169 719 and yen390 921, respectively; the expected numbers of disease-free days were 1454 days and 1313 days, respectively. In the duodenal ulcer model, the expected total costs were yen134 786 and yen324 689, respectively; the expected numbers of disease-free days were 1503 days and 1387 days, respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the base case analysis were robust.
This eradication therapy is less costly and more effective than conventional therapy for the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers in a Japanese medical setting.
Remodeling of a bone graft can be influenced both by anabolic substances, such as a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and by anticatabolic substances, such as the bisphosphonates. BMPs are potent bone anabolic substances, but also boost catabolism and cause resorption. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast function and can be used to postpone resorption. In the present study a combination of both drugs was explored in a rat bone chamber model. Cancellous bone grafts were treated with either BMP-7 or saline and placed in a bone chamber implanted in the proximal tibia. After 2 weeks, an injection of either zoledronate 0.1 mg/kg or saline was given subcutaneously. The rats were killed after 6 weeks, and bone ingrowth distance into the graft and graft resorption were measured by histomorphometry. BMP-7 significantly (p = 0.007) increased new bone ingrowth distance into the graft from 2.0 mm (SD = 0.98 mm) in the controls to 3.1 mm (SD = 0.93 mm). If bisphosphonate was not given, most of the newly formed and old graft bone was resorbed. A single injection of zoledronate significantly (p < 0.001) increased the trabecular volume/total volume to 40% (SD = 9%) compared to 14% (SD = 10%) in the nonbisphosphonate treated. In total, the net amount of bone increased by 400% when BMP-7 and zoledronate combined was compared to saline. A bone graft can be treated with BMP-7 to increase new bone formation and at the same time be protected against premature catabolism by a single dose of a bisphosphonate. This combination might be useful in various conditions in orthopedic reconstruction.
Use of urokinase to treat heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in one patient is described, and various treatments proposed for this syndrome are discussed. A 56-year-old man received an intravenous bolus dose of heparin sodium at his local hospital and was transferred to another institution for treatment of suspected pulmonary embolism; he had received heparin two weeks earlier during coronary angiography. The patient's platelet count was reported to be normal before heparin administration. When embolism was confirmed, heparin was discontinued and streptokinase was given for 24 hours. Heparin infusion was then restarted at 1000 units/hr and continued for four days. Platelet count on admission to the second hospital was 47,000/cu mm; 12 hours later it was 19,000/cu mm, and it remained low despite platelet transfusions. Five days after admission, deep-vein thrombosis developed in the left leg. Heparin was discontinued and urokinase and warfarin were started. Urokinase was infused at 320,000 IU/hr for 12 hours and continued at dosages of 160,000-320,000 IU/hr for a total of 40 hours. The initial warfarin sodium dose was 15 mg, followed by a dosage of 10 mg/day. Symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis improved within 12 hours and platelet count increased after heparin was discontinued. If it is recognized early enough, heparin-associated thrombocytopenia can be reversed by discontinuation of heparin. Transfusions of platelets are of little benefit. Dipyridamole, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin, and protamine sulfate may be useful. Long term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended to prevent recurrent thrombosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Methazolamide (150 mg/d) was as effective as acetazolamide (500 mg/d) in preventing the symptoms of acute mountain sickness in 20 subjects ascending to 4985 m. PaO2 and oxygen saturation levels were similar on the two drugs but the fall in PaCO2 was greater on acetazolamide. Paraesthesiae, a side-effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, tended to be less at high altitude on methazolamide and was significantly less when taking 100 mg/d at low altitude. It is likely that paraesthesiae is similar on the two drugs when given in doses that affect blood gases equally.
Cyclophosphamide (CYP) treatment induces chemical cystitis leading to bladder overactivity (OAB) in animals and humans. There is a great number of OAB models evaluations, which consider the bladder histology, as well as alterations in neurochemical, electrophysiological properties of bladder afferent neurons and reflex arcs activity in the spinal cord. However there are no data differentiating cystometrically acute and chronic models of OAB induced by CYP under urethane anaesthesia. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of acute and chronic models of CYP-induced cystitis on urinary bladder motor activity in rats.
The rat mutant dystonic displays an autosomal recessive neurological disease characterized by slow, twisting movements of the limbs and trunk. Rats displaying clinical signs also show a decreased behavioral response to the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol. Investigation of the development of the cataleptic response to haloperidol in the dystonic (dt) rat indicated that the response of the dt rat in the bar test is similar to that of normal littermates until after the appearance of clinical symptoms in the mutants on postnatal day 10. Mutant rats did not differ from their normal littermates in response to another cataleptic agent, morphine. Assessment of the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system did not indicate the presence of any degenerative process or of any alterations in DA metabolism. No reliable differences were found between normal and dt rats in striatal DA levels or turnover rates; in DA levels in response to gamma-hydroxybutyrolactone; or in the number and affinity of striatal DA muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Nor did qualitative light microscopic examination of Golgi-impregnated tissue from dt rats indicate the presence of any morphological abnormalities in the striatum. These findings suggest that dystonic symptoms can occur in the absence of an alteration in striatal DA metabolism and that the dt rat may have a defect in a pathway efferent to the striatum.
Our previous work demonstrated that the extracellular matrix protein mindin contributes to allergic airways disease. However, the role of mindin in nonallergic airways disease has not previously been explored.
We hypothesized that mindin would contribute to airways disease after inhalation of either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or ozone.
We exposed C57BL/6J and mindin-deficient (-/-) mice to aerosolized LPS (0.9 μg/m3 for 2.5 hr), saline, ozone (1 ppm for 3 hr), or filtered air (FA). All mice were evaluated 4 hr after LPS/saline exposure or 24 hr after ozone/FA exposure. We characterized the physiological and biological responses by analysis of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) with a computer-controlled small-animal ventilator (FlexiVent), inflammatory cellular recruitment, total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), proinflammatory cytokine profiling, and ex vivo bronchial ring studies.
After inhalation of LPS, mindin-/- mice demonstrated significantly reduced total cell and neutrophil recruitment into the airspace compared with their wild-type counterparts. Mindin-/- mice also exhibited reduced proinflammatory cytokine production and lower AHR to methacholine challenge by FlexiVent. After inhalation of ozone, mice had no detectible differences in cellular inflammation or total BALF protein dependent on mindin. However, mindin-/- mice were protected from increased proinflammatory cytokine production and AHR compared with their C57BL/6J counterparts. After ozone exposure, bronchial rings derived from mindin-/- mice demonstrated reduced constriction in response to carbachol.
These data demonstrate that the extracellular matrix protein mindin modifies the airway response to both LPS and ozone. Our data support a conserved role of mindin in production of proinflammatory cytokines and the development of AHR in two divergent models of reactive airways disease, as well as a role of mindin in airway smooth muscle contractility after exposure to ozone.
Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to selectively lower pulmonary vascular resistance and is applied in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT). However, application and monitoring is complex and not always successful ("non-responders"). We evaluated the effect of aerolized prostacyclin (aePGI2) as a therapeutic alternate to NO.
aePGI2 and NO were applied to patients with different causes of pulmonary hypertension (Group 1a: preoperative patients with intracardiac shunting defects and Eisenmenger's disease, n = 30; Group 1b: patients with primary or postoperative PHT, n = 13; Group 2: PHT immediately following surgery for congenital heart disease, n = 6).
Pulmonary vascular resistance could be lowered significantly (Group 1a: from 91% of systemic vascular resistance to 58% with NO and 53% with aePGI2; Group 1b: from 20.2 Wood Units*m2 to 13.4 and 11.3; Group 2: from 24.9 Wood Units*m2 to 9.5 and 10.5); cardiac index increased (Group 1b: from 2.96 to 3.55 and 3.96 l/min*m2, Group 2: from 1.57 to 1.89 and 2.00 l/min*m2).
The short-term application of aePGI2 shows a selective pulmonary vasodilation similar to NO. Given adequate monitoring, aePGI2 appears to be useful for the acute treatment of PHT.
Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Although mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of renal anemia include chronic inflammation, iron deficiency, and shortened half-life of erythrocytes, the primary cause is deficiency of erythropoietin (EPO). Serum EPO levels in patients with chronic kidney disease are usually within the normal range and thus fail to show an appropriate increase with decreasing hemoglobin levels, as found in nonrenal anemias. Studies elucidating the regulation of EPO expression led to the identification of the hypoxia inducible factor-hypoxia responsive element system. However, despite much progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms through which cells can sense oxygen availability and translate this information into altered gene expression, the reason why EPO production is inappropriately low in diseased kidneys remains incompletely understood. Both alterations in the function of EPO-producing cells and perturbations of the oxygen-sensing mechanism in the kidney may contribute. As with other anemias, the consequences of renal anemia are a moderate decrease in tissue oxygen tensions and counterregulatory mechanisms that maintain total oxygen consumption, including a persistent increase in cardiac output.
Audiometric changes following quinine administration were studied in healthy Caucasian subjects and patients suffering from falciparum malaria disease. Quinine-dihydrochloride was administered intravenously as a single dose of 300 mg to 12 healthy subjects and as multiple doses of 600 mg in 4 h every 8 h in 10 Plasmodium falciparum malaria patients. The hearing function was monitored by conventional and high frequency audiometry. In nine healthy subjects hearing loss was documented at 2-4 h after infusion of Quinine-dihydrochloride at a mean maximal plasma quinine concentration of only 2 mg/l. In one healthy subject a persistent loss occurred of 20 dB at 14 kHz in one ear. In all malaria patients severe hearing losses and adverse effects related to ototoxicity were documented, but all the audiograms had returned to normal after 1 week and side effects disappeared. This study has shown that ototoxicity induced by quinine is almost completely reversible in healthy volunteers and in malaria patients.
The ratio of the relative risk of lung cancer due to asbestos exposure in non-smokers to that in smokers has been termed the relative asbestos effect (RAE). In a review, Liddell [Liddell FDK (2001) Ann Occup Hyg; 45: 341-56] estimated that the RAE was approximately 2. This measure is satisfactory when there is an appreciable relative risk due to asbestos but does not generalize to lower levels of exposure. A modified measure is proposed to overcome this difficulty. The modified measure, RAEm, is defined as the ratio of the excess relative risk (RR - 1) in non-smokers to that in smokers.
The cohort studies combined in Liddell's 2001 analysis have been used to give a combined estimate of the modified measure.
The combined value of RAEm is 3.19 with 95% confidence interval 1.67-6.13.
The excess relative risk of lung cancer from asbestos exposure is about three times higher in non-smokers than in smokers. The modified measure has been placed within a more versatile model of interaction. If interaction is present the relative risk from asbestos exposure changes only slightly between light and heavy smokers, but is higher in very light smokers and non-smokers. The relative risk estimated from epidemiological studies of a mixed population of non-smokers and smokers applies to smokers.
Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of epilepsy in humans. Caspase activation is a mechanism of cell death induced by seizures. Tellurium (IV) compounds present antitumoral, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects due to their ability to inhibit cysteine proteases. We studied the activity of caspase-1, -3 and -8 in the hippocampus of rats exhibiting status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine. All three caspases were activated. Tellurium (IV) compounds RF-07, RF-03 and AS-101 inhibited caspases in vitro, showing high second-order inhibition rate constants. The intraperitoneal injection of RF-07 prior to pilocarpine suppressed the behavioral and electroencephalographic seizure occurrence. According to our results, the caspases are activated as early as 90 min following SE. Tellurium (IV) compounds exerted anticonvulsant effects associated with the inhibition of caspases. These results suggest a promising therapeutic potential of organotellurium (IV) compounds as antiepileptogenic agents.
Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are rapidly synthesized in cells in response to various cytotoxic agents. Although several stress proteins are actively involved in the gentamicin-induced renal damages, the possible role of HSP47 in this condition is not yet clear. In this study, the expression of HSP47 in the gentamicin nephrotoxicity was examined by immunohistochemistry. Twenty male Wistar rats were sacrificed at day 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after subcutaneous injection of gentamicin. Gentamicin treatment causes tubular necrosis at day 3, followed by tubular regenerative changes and interstitial fibrosis, which was most prominent at day 14. The renal structures returned to almost normal architectures at day 28. By immunohistochemistry, HSP47 was weakly expressed in most of the glomeruli and occasionally in interstitial cells in the control rat kidneys. In contrast, strong immunostaining for HSP47 was noted in the tubular epithelial cells and interstitial cells in gentamicin treated rat kidneys, and strongest staining was observed at day 7. The immunostaining for HSP47 then gradually decreased, and returned to the normal level at day 28. In the whole experimental period staining pattern of HSP47 in the glomeruli was not changed. In addition, phenotypically altered tubulointerstitial cells including regenerative tubular epithelial cells (immuno-positive for vimentin) and interstitial cells (immuno-positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin) were found in gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Expression of type III collagen increased in the areas of interstitial fibrosis. By double immunostaining, the regenerated and phenotypically altered tubulointerstitial cells were found to express HSP47 in and around interstitial fibrosis. It is concluded that overexpression of HSP47 by phenotypically altered renal cells might play a significant role in the development of gentamicin nephrotoxicity.
