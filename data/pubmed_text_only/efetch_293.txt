Approximately half of all cardiovascular fatalities are attributable to sudden cardiac death, and the majority of sudden cardiac deaths result from ventricular fibrillation (VF). Antiarrhythmic agents are needed to manage refractory VF and ventricular tachycardia (VT); the primary reason for their administration is to prevent recurrence of VF and to abolish VT. The American Heart Association recommends lidocaine hydrochloride as a first-line antiarrhythmic agent in the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) setting, followed by bretylium tosylate. Although the newly approved intravenous antiarrhythmic agent, amiodarone hydrochloride, may potentially be effective in ACLS, studies are needed to document its clinical benefit in this setting. Such studies are currently under way to document this potential use.
It has been documented that the HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, can decrease cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with clinical coronary disease and moderately to severely elevated lipid levels. Additional data are required to demonstrate a reduction of vascular events in coronary patients with less than severely elevated lipid levels and in subgroups of this population.
Clinical data from four atherosclerosis regression trials that evaluated pravastatin were pooled for a predetermined analysis of the effect of that agent on the risk of coronary events. All trials were double-masked, placebo-controlled designs that used pravastatin as monotherapy for 2 to 3 years. The 1891 participants in the trials had evidence of atherosclerosis and mildly to moderately elevated lipid levels. For fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, there was a 62% reduction in events attributable to pravastatin (p = .001). This effect was evident in younger and older patients, men and women, and patients with and without histories of hypertension and prior infarction. There was a 46% reduction in all-cause mortality (p = 17), which, although not statistically significant, is consistent with the results of other statin trials. There also was a 62% reduction in the risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke (p = .054).
These pooled results provide strong evidence that pravastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic disease and mildly to moderately elevated lipid levels. The benefit for reducing myocardial infarction is evident in older and younger patients, men and women, and patients with and without histories of hypertension and prior infarction.
Riluzole, an anti-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug, known to decrease presynaptic glutamate release, is viewed as a candidate supplementary medication for epilepsy. In the present study, we compared the effects of riluzole and valproate (VPA) in the pilocarpine-induced limbic seizure model and in the gamma-hydroxybutyrate lactone (GBL)-induced absence seizure model. We applied immunohistochemical study for vesicular transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and extracellular recording in the rat dentate gyrus of both pilocarpine- and GBL-induced seizure models to measure effects of riluzole and VPA. Both VPA and riluzole treatments reduced VGLUT1 immunoreactivity. Riluzole treatment completely inhibited pre-ictal spikes and spike-wave discharges in the pilocarpine- and GBL-induced epilepsy models, whereas VPA partially inhibited these phenomena. In both seizure models, the anti-epileptic effects of VPA and riluzole are basically related to anti-glutamatergic (reducing field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and excitability ratio), not GABAergic (paired-pulse inhibition) effect. Riluzole was more effective at reducing seizure activity in both epilepsy models than VPA. These results suggest that riluzole is a potential antiepileptic drug with activity against limbic seizure and absence seizure.
Streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetes was induced in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats with their litter mates serving as controls. The animals were studied for 6 months and blood pressure, weight, urinary and serum glucose, creatinine clearance, total proteinuria and albuminuria were measured monthly. With induction of diabetes, there was a significant rise in creatinine clearance in the hypertensive diabetic animals (SHR-STZ). SHR-STZ (n = 6) developed higher levels of total proteinuria than WKY-STZ (n = 5) although the rise from basal levels was only apparent after 20 weeks of diabetes. All SHR-STZ developed albustix positive proteinuria after 6 months of diabetes. In the first 12 weeks after onset of diabetes, albuminuria increased to a greater degree in SHR-STZ than in WKY-STZ. This occurred before there was a detectable rise in total proteinuria. The SHR-STZ model of genetic hypertension and diabetes may be suitable for the evaluation of antihypertensive therapy in human diabetic renal disease.
T-helper cells type 1 (Th1) and type 2 (Th2) play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. In many Th1-dependent autoimmune models, treatment with recombinant interleukin-12 (rIL-12) accelerates the autoimmune response. Mercury-induced autoimmunity (HgIA) in mice is an H-2 regulated condition with antinucleolar antibodies targeting fibrillarin (ANoA), systemic immune-complex (IC) deposits and transient polyclonal B-cell activation (PBA). HgIA has many characteristics of a Th2 type of reaction, including a strong increase of IgE, but disease induction is critically dependent on the Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma. The aim of this study was to investigate if a strong deviation of the immune response in HgIA towards Th1 would aggravate HgIA. Injections of both rIL-12 and anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody (alpha-IL-4) reduced the HgCl2-(Hg-)induced concentration of the Th2-dependent serum IgE and IgG1, but increased the Th1-dependent serum IgG2a. The IgG-ANoA developed earlier and attained a higher titre after combined treatment, and the ANoA titre of the IgG1 isotype decreased while the ANoA titre of the Th1-associated IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3-ANoA isotypes increased. Treatment with rIL-12 alone increased the Hg-induced IgG2a and IgG3 ANoA titres, the PBA, and the IC deposits in renal and splenic vessel walls, while treatment with alpha-IL-4 + Hg inhibited renal but not splenic vessel wall IC deposits. We conclude that manipulating the cytokine status, by altering the Th1/Th2 balance, will influence autoimmune disease manifestations. This might be an important way of modulating human autoimmune diseases.
Dyskinesias are the most frequent adverse effect of chronic levodopa therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Current pharmacological treatment for this problem is unsatisfactory. Recently, there is evidence for the role of glutamate in the basal ganglia neuronal circuitry in the generation of dyskinesias. If indeed glutamatergic overactivity beyond the dopaminergic synapses plays a role in the pathogenesis of these involuntary movements, there is hope that its suppression may be beneficial without causing loss of levodopa efficacy and parkinsonian deterioration. Indeed, NMDA receptor antagonists such as amantadine and dextrometorphan can reduce such dyskinesias. We tested the efficacy of riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamatergic transmission in the inhibition of levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
The objective was to observe changes in rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) catecholamine metabolism using in vivo voltammetry following induced hypotension with halothane or nitroprusside (SNP). Rats anesthetized (halothane, metocurine) and ventilated were stereotaxically implanted with carbon microelectrodes in the RVLM. The catechol oxidation current (CA.OC, % baseline) was used as an index of RVLM catecholaminergic metabolism. Groups of rats (n = 5) were given (A) halothane 0.75% for 60 min; (B) halothane 2.75% plus phenylephrine infusion to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) for 30 min, then halothane 0.75% for 30 min; (C) halothane (2.5-3.0%) for 30 min (MAP 60 +/- 5 mmHg) then halothane 0.75% for 30 min; (D) halothane 0.75% and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for 30 min (MAP 60 +/- 5 mmHg), then halothane 0.75% for 30 min. Halothane 0.75% produced no significant change in CA.OC or MAP (A), while halothane 2.5-3.0% produced a significant decrease in MAP and a symmetrical significant increase in CA.OC (ANOVA, P less than 0.5). This increase peaked at 30 min (180 +/- 28%) and reached 110 +/- 9% baseline at 60 min. The halothane and phenylephrine combination produced no significant change in CA.OC or MAP during the 30 min exposure (B). SNP (D) produced a significant increase in CA.OC (peak 48 min, 224 +/- 35%) which remained elevated at 60 min (198 +/- 32%). Thus, the induced hypotension produced activation of RVLM catecholaminergic neurons. SNP induced a prolonged significant increase in RVLM catecholamine metabolism which may relate to rebound hypertension following use of this drug.
Serum aldosterone and plasma renin were measured in 20 normal infants and 15 infants with congestive cardiac failure. Serum aldosterone was significantly increased (151 +/- 38 ng/dl mean +/- standard error of the mean) in patients before treatment when compared with aldosterone in normal infants (29 +/- 7 ng/dl). Increasing serum aldosterone was related to increasing plasma renin. The response to furosemide appeared to be inversely related to serum aldosterone concentrations. In four infants, administration of an aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone) resulted in improved diuresis and decreased serum aldosterone. Hyperaldosteronism is an important factor contributing to fluid and sodium retention in infants with heart failure.
To gain insights into the antitumor mechanisms of resveratrol (RES), we carried out a DNA microarray analysis in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 to study the global gene expression profile induced by RES treatment. The mRNA expression level of 19 734 well-characterized human genes from MCF-7 cells was determined using Affymetrix microarrays under two different RES treatments: 150 μmol/l (IC(50)) and 250 μmol/l during 48 h. A total of 1211 genes were found to have altered mRNA expression levels of two-fold or more in the 150 μmol/l RES-treated group (518 upregulated and 693 downregulated genes). However, 2412 genes were found to have altered expression levels of two-fold or more in the 250 μmol/l RES-treated group (651 genes upregulated and 1761 downregulated). Under both conditions of RES treatment, several genes of mismatch repair, DNA replication, homologous recombination (HR), and cell cycle were strongly inhibited. Consistently, we found decreased protein levels of the MRN complex (MRE11-NBS1-RAD50), an important complex of the HR DNA repair pathway. The ability to inhibit the expression of DNA repair genes by RES could help to overcome drug resistance commonly shown by transformed cells and to provide a solid basis for carrying out clinical trials with RES, alone or in combination with other agents, to enhance treatment efficacy, reduce toxicity, and overcome chemoresistance. Remarkably, after RES treatment, we found a decrease in NBS1 and MRE11 protein levels, two major proteins involved in HR, which suggests that RES could be used to sensitize cancer cells to cell death in combination with anticancer drugs.
Cocaine can provoke seizures, exacerbate a preexisting seizure disorder, or cause an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke that leads to seizures. To determine the importance of cocaine use in patients with and without epilepsy, we studied these relations and other risk factors for seizures and the mode of cocaine use.
We reviewed all charts of emergency department visits and hospitalizations of patients with discharge diagnoses simultaneously listing seizures, epilepsy, and cocaine use during a 24-month period. Data collected included patient age, sex, route of cocaine use, seizure description and duration of epilepsy, provocative factors, results of electroencephalography and computed tomography, treatment, and outcome.
Of 67,668 adult emergency department visits and 25,768 adult admissions, 1,900 were cocaine related, and 58 of these also had seizures or epilepsy. Seizure occurrences were approximately equally distributed among groups with idiopathic epilepsy, remote symptomatic localization-related epilepsy, cerebrovascular disease, and acute symptomatic seizures due to cocaine use alone. Less frequently, seizures were cryptogenic or symptomatic of metabolic abnormalities.
Cocaine use can reduce seizure threshold in patients with underlying epilepsy as a direct toxic effect or indirectly by contributing to poor compliance with antiepileptic drug treatment, poor diet, or poor sleep habits. In 12 of the 58 patients, cocaine appeared to be the only provocative factor. This may be a less significant risk factor for epilepsy than either alcohol or head trauma.
A 74-year-old man became delirious 2 days after beginning oral therapy with methazolamide. The delirium was manifested by intermittent psychosis, incontinence of bowel and bladder, lethargy, and disorientation. These symptoms continued for 25 days despite many changes in his drug regimen, and complete laboratory, urologic, and neurologic work-ups. The symptoms resolved completely within 1 week of discontinuing methazolamide. This is the first case reported of delirium associated with methazolamide not accompanied by a metabolic imbalance.
We investigated hypohomocysteinemic action as a cardiovascular protective property of aged garlic extract (AGE). Hyperhomocysteinemia was induced in rats by feeding folate-depleted diets. Plasma folate concentrations of 5, 24, and 202 nmol/L were detected in rats fed a folate-deficient L-amino acid diet containing succinyl sulfathiazole, an AIN-93G folate-deficient diet, and an AIN-93G folate-sufficient diet, respectively. Plasma concentrations of total homocysteine were elevated to the highest level (32 micromol/L) by severe folate deficiency and to a moderate level (9 micromol/L) by mild folate deficiency, compared with the lowest level of (5 micromol/L), noted for the folate-sufficient group. The addition of AGE to the severely folate-deficient diet decreased plasma total homocysteine concentration by 30%. Hyperhomocysteinemia caused by mild folate deficiency remained unaltered by AGE supplementation. The reduction in total homocysteine of the severely folate-deficient rats was accompanied by a proportional decrease in protein-bound and free homocysteine, resulting in an unchanged protein-bound:free homocysteine ratio. AGE added to the diet did not alter plasma concentrations of other aminothiol compounds: cysteine, glutathione, and cysteinylglycine. These data, together with increased S-adenosylmethionine and decreased S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations in the liver, suggest that the hypohomocysteinemic effect of AGE most likely stems from impaired remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and enhanced transsulfuration of homocysteine to cystathionine. More importantly, in addition to its cholesterol-lowering potential, blood pressure-lowering effect, and antioxidant property, a hypohomocysteinemic action may be another important cardiovascular protective factor of AGE.
Arsenic, one of the most harmful metalloids, is ubiquitous in the environment. The present study has been carried out to investigate the protective role of a triterpenoid saponin, arjunolic acid (AA) against arsenic-induced cardiac oxidative damage. In the study, NaAsO2 was chosen as the source of arsenic. The free radical scavenging activity and the effect of AA on the intracellular antioxidant power were determined from its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical scavenging ability and ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay, respectively. Oral administration of NaAsO2 at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 2 days caused significant accumulation of arsenic in cardiac tissues of the experimental mice in association with the reduction in cardiac antioxidant enzymes activities, namely superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase. Arsenic intoxication also decreased the cardiac glutathione (GSH) and total thiol contents and increased the levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation end products and protein carbonyl content. Treatment with AA at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight for 4 days prior to NaAsO2 intoxication protected the cardiac tissue from arsenic-induced oxidative impairment. In addition to oxidative stress, arsenic administration increased total cholesterol level as well as the reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the sera of the experimental mice. AA pretreatment, however, could prevent this hyperlipidemia. Histological studies on the ultrastructural changes in cardiac tissue supported the protective activity of AA also. Combining all, results suggest that AA could protect cardiac tissues against arsenic-induced oxidative stress probably due to its antioxidant property.
Bcl-2 regulates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway that promotes chemotherapy resistance. Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide, G3139, targets Bcl-2 mRNA.
G3139 was administered (3 to 7 mg/kg/d for 7 days) by continuous intravenous infusion. On day 4, patients started thalidomide (100 to 400 mg as tolerated) and dexamethasone (40 mg daily for 4 days) on 21-day cycles for three cycles. Stable and responding patients continued on 35-day cycles for 2 years.
Thirty-three patients (median age, 60 years; range, 28 to 76 years) received 220 cycles. Patients received a median of three prior regimens including thalidomide (n = 15) and stem-cell transplantation (n = 31). The regimen was well tolerated; the median number of cycles per patient was eight (range, one to 16+ cycles). Toxicities included reversible increase in creatinine, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, anorexia, constipation, fever, neuropathy, edema, electrolyte disturbances, and hyperglycemia. Fifty-five percent of patients had objective responses, including two complete responses (CRs), four near CRs (positive immunofixation), and 12 partial responses; six patients had minimal responses (MRs). Of patients who received prior thalidomide, seven had objective responses, and three had MRs. The median duration of response was 13 months, and estimated progression-free and overall survival times were 12 and 17.4 months, respectively. Responding patients had significant increase in polyclonal immunoglobulin M (P = .005), indicating innate immune system activation. Western blot analysis of Bcl-2 protein isolated from myeloma cells before and after G3139 demonstrated a decrease of Bcl-2 levels in three of seven patients compared with six of nine patients using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
G3139, dexamethasone, and thalidomide are well tolerated and result in encouraging clinical responses in relapsed multiple myeloma patients.
Benzene is a well-known environmental pollutant that can induce hematotoxicity, aplastic anemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and lymphoma. However, although benzene metabolites are known to induce oxidative stress and disrupt the cell cycle, the mechanism underlying lympho/leukemogenicity is not fully understood. Caspase-4 (alias caspase-11) and -12 are inflammatory caspases implicated in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. The objectives of this study were to investigate the altered expression of caspase-4 and -12 in mouse bone marrow after benzene exposure and to determine whether their alterations are associated with benzene-induced bone marrow toxicity, especially cellular apoptosis. In addition, we evaluated whether the p53 gene is involved in regulating the mechanism, using both wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the p53 gene. For this study, 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice [WT and p53 knockout (KO)] were administered a benzene solution (150 mg/kg diluted in corn oil) via oral gavage once daily, 5 days/week, for 1 or 2 weeks. Blood and bone marrow cells were collected and cell counts were measured using a Coulter counter. Total mRNA and protein extracts were prepared from the harvested bone marrow cells. Then qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect changes in the caspases at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. A DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V staining were carried out on the bone marrow cells to detect apoptosis. Results indicated that when compared to the control, leukocyte number and bone marrow cellularity decreased significantly in WT mice. The expression of caspase-4 and -12 mRNA increased significantly after 12 days of benzene treatment in the bone marrow cells of benzene-exposed p53KO mice. However, apoptosis detection assays indicated no evidence of apoptosis in p53KO or WT mice. In addition, no changes of other apoptosis-related caspases, such as caspase-3 and -9, were found in WT or p53KO mice at the level of mRNA and proteins. These results indicated that upregulation of caspase-4 and -12 in mice lacking the p53 gene is not associated with cellular apoptosis. In conclusion, caspase-4 and -12 can be activated by benzene treatment without inducing cell apoptosis in mouse bone marrow, which are partly under the regulation of the p53 gene.
Children with acute leukemia often receive therapy that is potentially cardiotoxic. Development of irreversible cardiac impairment requiring heart transplant may appear many years after anticancer therapy. Other possible causes are discussed.
We describe a young leukemia survivor who developed severe heart failure needing a heart transplant.
A 4-year-old boy was treated with standard doses of chemotherapy containing cardiotoxic daunorubicin and mitoxantrone, and later, with an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Twelve years after the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, and following a viral infection of an unknown cause, he developed symptoms of heart failure. Severe dilated cardiomyopathy; and severe, left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 12% were noted on echocardiography. The patient required a heart transplant 19 years after the diagnosis of leukemia.
Cardiac failure may progressively occur in childhood leukemia survivors. Heart transplant is indicated in patients with refractory hemodynamic decompensation.
Angiosarcoma of the liver occurred in a 76-year-old man who had been treated for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver with diethylstilbestrol for 13 years. Angiosarcoma was also present within pulmonary and renal arteries. The possibility that the intraarterial lesions might represent independent primary tumors is considered.
In mammalian cells, the repair of DNA bases that have been damaged by reactive oxygen species is primarily initiated by a series of DNA glycosylases that include OGG1, NTH1, NEIL1, and NEIL2. To explore the functional significance of NEIL1, we recently reported that neil1 knock-out and heterozygotic mice develop the majority of symptoms of metabolic syndrome (Vartanian, V., Lowell, B., Minko, I. G., Wood, T. G., Ceci, J. D., George, S., Ballinger, S. W., Corless, C. L., McCullough, A. K., and Lloyd, R. S. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 1864-1869). To determine whether this phenotype could be causally related to human disease susceptibility, we have characterized four polymorphic variants of human NEIL1. Although three of the variants (S82C, G83D, and D252N) retained near wild type levels of nicking activity on abasic (AP) site-containing DNA, G83D did not catalyze the wild type beta,delta-elimination reaction but primarily yielded the beta-elimination product. The AP nicking activity of the C136R variant was significantly reduced. Glycosylase nicking activities were measured on both thymine glycol-containing oligonucleotides and gamma-irradiated genomic DNA using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Two of the polymorphic variants (S82C and D252N) showed near wild type enzyme specificity and kinetics, whereas G83D was devoid of glycosylase activity. Although insufficient quantities of C136R could be obtained to carry out gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses, this variant was also devoid of the ability to incise thymine glycol-containing oligonucleotide, suggesting that it may also be glycosylase-deficient. Extrapolation of these data suggests that individuals who are heterozygous for these inactive variant neil1 alleles may be at increased risk for metabolic syndrome.
Aztreonam was administered to 145 consecutive patients with complicated urinary tract infections caused by multidrug-resistant, aztreonam-sensitive bacteria. Multidrug resistance was defined by disk diffusion testing as resistance to aminopenicillins and to first- and second-generation cephalosporins, with or without resistance to aminoglycosides. The first 40 assessable patients received 1 g of aztreonam intravenously three times daily for a median period of eight days; the remaining 95 assessable patients received 0.5 g twice daily for a median period of nine days. Fifty-five patients were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 with Escherichia coli, 18 with Serratia marcescens, 13 with Morganella morganii, 12 with Providencia rettgeri, and 10 with Enterobacter species. Bacteriologic cure rates were 98% for the group given 3 g daily and 96% for that given 1 g daily. Minimal and transient adverse reactions occurred with both dosages.
Chemical burn injuries including nitric acid injuries are rarely seen in routine clinical practice. In this article, we describe a case of chemical burns due to ingestion of nitric acid in which the history was not of an accidental but of a suicidal nature. Spillage of nitric acid (vitriolage) is frequently reported especially in the third-world countries, but an ingestion injury like this is uncommon and rarely reported.
A retinoneuritis due to ethambutol (Myambutol) occurs with Myambutol doses of over 20 mg/kg per day after 3 weeks to 15 months. Visual acuity can deteriorate within the following 6 months even after immediate discontinuation of treatment with Myambutol. It may recover 2 months (though in some cases only 16 months) after the onset of the deterioration; in cases of optic atrophy a more severe loss of vision usually remains. If there was loss of vision to 1/10 or less there was in most cases no change in the visual acuity. On the other hand, a primary loss of vision to only 0.3 or 0.4 usually ended with recovery of full vision. The occasionally observed clinical picture of a reddish optic disk, retinal hemorrhages, a very fine granular pigment alteration of the macular region, and loss of vision for more than a year without optic disk pallor suggests a toxic retinitis or retinoneuritis rather than neuritis. This is confirmed by electrophysiological observations.
