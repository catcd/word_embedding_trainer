This report describes a case of possible drug interaction in a patient taking chlorpromazine and guanethidine who experienced a hypertensive crisis following initiation of doxepin therapy. (We have been unable to find a report of a similar interaction at the doses described.) It is advised that physicians exercise caution when contemplating concomitant use of doxepin and guanethidine, even in usually recommended doses.
Scorpion venom possesses protein toxins having numerous biological activities, some of which are potentially anticancerous. Previously we had reported antiproliferative activity of the venom of Indian black scorpion, Heterometrus bengalensis Koch. Here we have isolated and purified a novel protein named Bengalin (72kDa) from the venom, responsible for antiproliferative and apoptogenic activities against human leukemic cells U937 (histiocytic lymphoma) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia). N-terminal sequence of first 20 amino acids of Bengalin was G-P-L-T-I-L-H-I-N-D-V-H-A-A/R-F-E-Q/G-F/G-N-T. Bengalin induced cell growth inhibition at IC(50) values of 3.7 and 4.1 microg/ml for U937 and K562 cells respectively did not significantly affect normal human lymphocytes. Inhibition of U937 and K562 cell proliferation occurred by apoptosis as evidenced from damaged nuclei, cell cycle arrest at sub G1 phase, increase of early apoptotic cells, augmentation of DNA fragmentation and also a reduction of telomerase activity. Further insights revealed that Bax:Bcl2 ratio was elevated after Bengalin treatment. Moreover Bengalin elicited loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) which commenced cytochrome c release in cytosol, decreased heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and 90 expression, activated caspase-9, caspase-3 and induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. We have also determined that HSP70 and 90 inhibitions correlated with Bengalin induced antiproliferation, caspase-3 upregulation, apoptogenesis and increased DNA fragmentation. These results hypothesize that Bengalin might provide a putative molecular mechanism for their anticancer effect on human leukemic cells which might be mediated by mitochondrial death cascade. Inhibition of HSPs might also play a crucial role in induction of apoptosis.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of brucine on secretion of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4 and proliferation of T lymphocytes in patients with aplastic anemia (AA), and to explore its mechanism. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from 10 patients with AA and 10 healthy volunteers were isolated, purified and cultured. T lymphocytes from the patients were divided into 0, 100, 200 and 400 µg/ml brucine-treated groups. T lymphocytes from healthy volunteers were used as control group. After being cultured for 72 hours, the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4 in the supernatant of cultured T lymphocytes from AA patients were detected by ELISA, and the proliferation of T lymphocytes from AA patients was detected by MTT. The results showed that compared with the normal control group, the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ in the culture supernatant significantly increased, and IL-4 was significantly decreased. The levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ in the culture supernatant of brucine treated groups were lower, and were dependent on the concentration of brucine. However, the levels of IL-4 were found to be not obviously changed. The inhibition rate of T lymphocytes in 100, 200 and 400µg/ml brucine-treated groups were (13.61 ± 4.31)%, (14.28 ± 4.31)% and (15.12 ± 4.56)% respectively, among which the differences were not statistically significant. It is concluded that the brucine can reduce the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ through inhibiting the proliferation of T lymphocytes in AA patients, which provides experimental basis for therapy of AA patients.
Intradermal injection of capsaicin induces a region of visual flare (neurogenic inflammation) and regions with modality specific hyperalgesia. Their temporal and spatial profiles have been studied to elucidate the mechanism behind neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia. Until today, the flare response has mainly been quantified by visual inspection. However, recent developments of thermography and laser-Doppler flowmetry have facilitated quantitative measurement of the neurogenic inflammation. The purpose of the present study was (1). to measure the temporal and spatial profiles of neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin by using thermography/laser-Doppler flowmetry and various sensory tests, and (2). to correlate the parameters related to neurogenic inflammation with the areas of secondary hyperalgesia. Eight healthy volunteers were injected intradermally with 250 microg of capsaicin. Five minutes after the injection, temperature and blood flow were measured by thermography and a laser-Doppler flowmetry, and followed by assessment of visual flare and hyperalgesia. Punctate hyperalgesia, stroking hyperalgesia, and heat hyperalgesia were assessed by von Frey hair, cotton swab, and radiant heat stimulator, respectively. This procedure was repeated 30 and 60 min after the injection. A significant increase in blood flow and temperature was detected by laser-Doppler flowmetry and thermography (F=102.08, P<0.001, and F=8.46, P=0.002, respectively). Throughout the experiment, the areas of visual flare, stroking hyperalgesia, and punctate hyperalgesia were covered by the area of significantly increased blood flow detected 5 min after the injection. The intensity of pain to heat stimuli significantly increased over time at the distal site and the proximal site (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the pain intensity to radiant heat stimuli inside/outside the area of punctate hyperalgesia. These results seem to indicate that a possible contribution of neurogenic inflammation to secondary hyperalgesia (especially to radiant heat stimuli) must be reconsidered.
A 46-year-old female patient with Sjögren's syndrome, hypertension, and stable chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine [CR], 1.9 to 2.1 mg/dL) had a progressive worsening of renal function (CR, 5.0 mg/dL) after 11 months of chloroquine therapy (155 mg/day; cumulative dose of approximately 51 g). Light microscopy revealed nonspecific angionephrosclerosis. Electron microscopy showed accumulations of lamellated myelinoid material and occasionally also of curvilinear bodies, especially in the glomerular podocytes and to a lesser extent in vascular myothelial and endothelial cells. In the tubular system, mainly protein droplets were stored. Activity of alpha-galactosidase A was normal in isolated leukocytes (56 nmol/mg; range, 33.2 to 109 nmol/mg), ruling out Fabry's disease. Clinical, morphological, and biochemical findings were consistent with chloroquine-associated deterioration of renal function that improved considerably after discontinuation of chloroquine treatment. Adverse effects of chloroquine may aggravate preexisting renal disease. Electron microscopy is a worthwhile tool for establishing the correct diagnosis.
Gram-negative bacterial infection or treatment of animals with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a catabolic state with proteolysis, liver injury and an inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) system. The purpose of this work was to elucidate the role of Kupffer cells in LPS-induced inhibition of the IGF-I/IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) system. Adult male Wistar rats were either pretreated with the Kupffer cell inhibitor gadolinium chloride (10 mg/kg, i.v., 24 h prior to LPS exposure) or saline vehicle. Rats received two i.p. injections of 1 mg/kg LPS (at 17:30 and 08:30 h the following day) and were killed 4 h after the second injection. LPS administration induced a significant decrease in body weight and in serum concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 (P < 0.01), as well as in their gene expression in the liver. LPS-injected rats had increased serum concentrations of ACTH, corticosterone (P < 0.05), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitrites (P < 0.01). Pretreatment of the animals with gadolinium chloride blocked the inhibitory effect of LPS on body weight, and on serum concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and nitrites, as well as growth hormone receptor (GHR), IGF-I and IGFBP-3 gene expression in the liver. In contrast, gadolinium chloride administration did not modify the stimulatory effect of LPS on serum concentrations of ACTH, corticosterone and TNF-alpha. These results suggest that Kupffer cells are important mediators in the inhibitory effect of LPS on GHR, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 gene expression in the liver, leading to a decrease in serum concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3.
Susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may involve a substantial, shared contribution from thousands of common genetic variants, each of small effect. Identifying whether risk variants map to specific molecular pathways is potentially biologically informative. We report a molecular pathway analysis using the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ratio test, which compares the ratio of nominally significant (P<0.05) to nonsignificant SNPs in a given pathway to identify the 'enrichment' for association signals. We applied this approach to the discovery (the International Schizophrenia Consortium (n=6909)) and validation (Genetic Association Information Network (n=2729)) of schizophrenia genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets. We investigated each of the 212 experimentally validated pathways described in the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes in the discovery sample. Nominally significant pathways were tested in the validation sample, and five pathways were found to be significant (P=0.03-0.001); only the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) pathway withstood conservative correction for multiple testing. Interestingly, this pathway was also significantly associated with bipolar disorder (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (n=4847)) (P=0.01). At a gene level, CAM genes associated in all three samples (NRXN1 and CNTNAP2), which were previously implicated in specific language disorder, autism and schizophrenia. The CAM pathway functions in neuronal cell adhesion, which is critical for synaptic formation and normal cell signaling. Similar pathways have also emerged from a pathway analysis of autism, suggesting that mechanisms involved in neuronal cell adhesion may contribute broadly to neurodevelopmental psychiatric phenotypes.
We have studied the pharmacodynamic effects of ramipril, propranolol, and their combination, as well as the effect of propranolol on the pharmacokinetics of ramipril in 12 healthy men (age 24 (SD 6) y, weight 72 (7) kg). Propranolol and placebo, ramipril and placebo, or propranolol and ramipril were given orally for four days in a crossover, double-blind fashion. The pharmacokinetics of ramipril and ramiprilat were investigated on day 4. Effects on plasma renin activity, ACE activity, and heart rate and blood pressure both before and after a standardized exercise test were measured on days 1 and 4. On day 4 the combination reduced the mean arterial pressure by 2.8 mmHg compared with propranolol alone and by 3.7 mmHg compared with ramipril alone. Ramipril had no effect on the bradycardia induced by propranolol. Propranolol reduced exercise mean arterial pressure by 9 mmHg (day 4) and heart rate by 7 beats.min-1 (day 4) compared with ramipril; this was not affected by co-administration of ramipril. On day 4 the average plasma renin activity was not significantly higher than after the combination. ACE activity was not affected by propranolol. The pharmacokinetics of ramipril and ramiprilat were not influenced by propranolol. The combination of ramipril and propranolol has additive pharmacodynamic effects that may be useful in the treatment of hypertension.
Intravenous mexiletine (3 mg/Kg as bolus) was given to 7 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia. Previous lidocaine administration in standard doses failed to suppress ventricular tachycardia. Mexiletine successfully suppressed the episodes of ventricular tachycardia in 6 of the 7 patients at a dose of 250 mg. Minimal non-cardiac toxicity occurred after mexiletine administration in the majority of patients. Mexiletine appears to be a promising alternative to lidocaine in the management of ventricular arrhythmias.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the western world. Despite several advances in therapeutic options, the disease remains incurable. Recently, it was repeatedly demonstrated that statins, competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, have antineoplastic effects. Therefore we aimed to study the effects of simvastatin (Sim) on malignant B cells derived from patients with CLL and mechanisms of action of the drug.
Purified B-CLL cells from 15 patients were cultured either alone or with Sim at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 microM. Viability, measured by the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, was reduced significantly in the cells treated with Sim at 50 and 100 microM for 24 hours (p<0.005). The level of apoptosis, as measured by annexin binding to exposed phosphatidylserine moieties, increased significantly in the treated cells at concentrations higher than 50 microM for 24 hours (p<0.003). The level of necrosis, as measured by propidium iodide internalization, increased significantly after 24 hours exposure to Sim at 50 microM (p<0.01). The apoptotic cascade was studied by immunoblot analysis of caspases following Sim treatment. These showed cleavage of caspases 9, 8, and 3. Addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk inhibited caspase 8 and 3 significantly but did not affect caspase 9.
Exposure of clonal B lymphocytes from patients with CLL to simvastatin decreases viability significantly by the induction of apoptosis. The apoptosis induced by Sim is probably initiated by the mitochondrial caspase 9, which indirectly leads to activation of caspase 3 and 8.
p66Shc is an adapter protein that is induced by hypertrophic stimuli and has been implicated as a major regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cardiovascular oxidative stress responses. This study implicates p66Shc in an alpha(1)-adrenergtic receptor (alpha(1)-AR) pathway that requires the cooperative effects of protein kinase (PK)Cepsilon and PKCdelta and leads to AKT-FOXO3a phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. alpha(1)-ARs promote p66Shc-YY(239/240) phosphorylation via a ROS-dependent mechanism that is localized to caveolae and requires epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PKCepsilon activity. alpha(1)-ARs also increase p66Shc-S(36) phosphorylation via an EGFR transactivation pathway involving PKCdelta. p66Shc links alpha(1)-ARs to an AKT signaling pathway that selectively phosphorylates/inactivates FOXO transcription factors and downregulates the ROS-scavenging protein manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD); the alpha(1)-AR-p66Shc-dependent pathway involving AKT does not regulate GSK3. Additional studies show that RNA interference-mediated downregulation of endogenous p66Shc leads to the derepression of FOXO3a-regulated genes such as MnSOD, p27Kip1, and BIM-1. p66Shc downregulation also increases proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, suggesting that p66Shc exerts an antihypertrophic action in neonatal cardiomyocytes. The novel alpha(1)-AR- and ROS-dependent pathway involving p66Shc identified in this study is likely to contribute to cardiomyocyte remodeling and the evolution of heart failure.
Drug-induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) is an uncommon adverse reaction secondary to the administration of numerous agents. It is diagnosed by exclusion, and its outcome is generally excellent with complete long term recovery. There are few reports of DIAM associated to intrathecal administration of bupivacaine in the literature.
We present a 16 year-old male patient who received spinal anaesthesia with 10 mg of bupivacaine prior to orthopedic surgery. A few hours later he complained of headache followed by confusion and stupor. A TC scan of the brain was normal. Diagnostic lumbar puncture revealed cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with increased polymorphonuclear, increased protein and decreased glucose concentrations. Immediate treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids was instituted and the patient rapidly recovered without sequelae. Blood and CSF cultures were negative, antibiotics were suspended and corticosteroids tapered.
To the best of our knowledge, we report a case of bupivacaine induced aseptic meningitis.
Chlorambucil neurotoxicity was observed in two children treated for frequently relapsing minimal change nephrotic syndrome. In the first child the drug was overdosed. Myoclonic jerks were observed, followed by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Concomitant EEG abnormalities disappeared after discontinuation of therapy, but reappeared 6 months later without further seizures. In the second child chlorambucil treatment was started twice, but had to be interrupted each time; the first time because of sudden collapse, bradycardia and respiratory arrest, and the second time because of myoclonic jerks. EEG changes were limited to generalized slowing and improved after discontinuation of therapy. According to the literature chlorambucil neurotoxicity is found almost exclusively in children, after overdosage or in the nephrotic syndrome. Strict neurologic supervision of patients treated with this drug is recommended.
Pulmonary ErbB4 deletion leads to a delay in fetal lung development, alveolar simplification, and lung function disturbances in adult mice. We generated a model of intrauterine infection in ErbB4 transgenic mice to study the additive effects of antenatal LPS administration and ErbB4 deletion during fetal lung development. Pregnant mice were treated intra-amniotically with an LPS dose of 4 μg at E17 of gestation. Lungs were analyzed 24 h later. A significant influx of inflammatory cells was seen in all LPS-treated lungs. In heterozygote control lungs, LPS treatment resulted in a delay of lung morphogenesis characterized by a significant increase in the fraction of mesenchyme, a decrease in gas exchange area, and disorganization of elastic fibers. Surfactant protein (Sftp)b and Sftpc were upregulated, but mRNA of Sftpb and Sftpc was downregulated compared with non-LPS-treated controls. The mRNA of Sftpa1 and Sftpd was upregulated. In ErbB4-deleted lungs, the LPS effects were more pronounced, resulting in a further delay in morphological development, a more pronounced inflammation in the parenchyma, and a significant higher increase in all Sftp. The effect on Sftpb and Sftpc mRNA was somewhat different, resulting in a significant increase. These results imply a major role of ErbB4 in LPS-induced signaling in structural and functional lung development.
The effects of two ginseng saponins having a different ratio of protopanaxadiol (PD) and protopanaxatriol saponins (PT) on the learning impairment induced by scopolamine, and learning and memory in mice were investigated in a passive avoidance task and a Morris water maze task. The ratio of PD and PT was 1.24 and 1.46, respectively. Before training, the ginseng saponins were administered intraperitoneally at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg. The two saponins improved the scopolamine-induced learning impairment at different dosages in mice, 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. However, the two saponins did not show a favorable effect on learning and memory in normal mice. Korean red ginseng saponin with a low PD/PT ratio had an improving effect on spatial working memory, but the saponin with a high PD/PT ratio did not. This finding suggests that the PD/PT ratio of the ginseng saponins may be an important factor in the pharmacological role of red ginseng as a medicinal herb.
Twenty-five patients with various forms of dyskinesia were given tiapride for three months. Maximal dosage was 900 mg per day. A double-blind trial of tiapride versus placebo showed significantly better results in the group given tiapride. The forms of dyskinesia which responded best to tiapride were the following: iatrogenic dyskinesia, tics (Gilles de la Tourette syndrome), and chronic chorea (Huntington disease). Patients with complex dyskinesia resulting from neonatal encephalopathy or vascular disease were not improved. The protocol used in l-dopa-induced dyskinesia is described. Changes in dyskinesia and "on-off" effect following variations in tiapride and l-dopa dosage are detailed. An unequivocal, although minor, tiapride-induced parkinson syndrome was recorded in a few patients. No instances of tiapride-induced dyskinesia or akathisia were seen. The other side-effects were either psychic (depression, drowsiness, agitation) or endocrinologic (menstrual disorders, overeating, galactorrhea).
Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is a water channel that is predominantly expressed in the colon, where it plays a critical role in the regulation of fecal water content. This study investigated the role of AQP3 in the colon in morphine-induced constipation. AQP3 expression levels in the colon were analyzed after oral morphine administration to rats. The degree of constipation was analyzed after the combined administration of HgCl2 (AQP3 inhibitor) or fluoxetine (5-HT reuptake transporter [SERT] inhibitor) and morphine. The mechanism by which morphine increased AQP3 expression was examined in HT-29 cells. AQP3 expression levels in rat colon were increased during morphine-induced constipation. The combination of HgCl2 and morphine improved morphine-induced constipation. Treatment with morphine in HT-29 cells did not change AQP3 expression. However, 5-HT treatment significantly increased the AQP3 expression level and the nuclear translocation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) 1 h after treatment. Pretreatment with fluoxetine significantly suppressed these increases. Fluoxetine pretreatment suppressed the development of morphine-induced constipation and the associated increase in AQP3 expression in the colon. The results suggest that morphine increases the AQP3 expression level in the colon, which promotes water absorption from the luminal side to the vascular side and causes constipation. This study also showed that morphine-induced 5-HT secreted from the colon was taken into cells by SERT and activated PPARγ, which subsequently increased AQP3 expression levels.
Hypokalaemia is a recognized complication of acute acetaminophen overdose. It is unclear whether this might be a pharmacological effect of acetaminophen, or due to association with confounding factors. The present study sought to better characterize the relationship between acetaminophen concentrations and risk of hypokalaemia. A prospective study of patients received N-acetylcysteine treatment within 15 hr of acute acetaminophen ingestion. Serum potassium concentrations were determined before and after N-acetylcysteine. Serum acetaminophen concentrations were used to indicate overall drug exposure by comparison to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram. Hypokalaemia was pre-defined by serum concentrations <3.5 mmol/l, and groups compared by Mann-Whitney tests. There were 331 patients. Median (95% confidence interval) fall in serum potassium concentration after N-acetylcysteine was 0.05 mmol/l (-0.11-0.30 mmol/l) if acetaminophen concentrations were below the 'high-risk' treatment line, 0.30 mmol/l (0.17-0.40 mmol/l) if between the 'high-risk' and 'normal' treatment lines (P = 0.0358), and 0.40 mmol/l (0.20-0.50 mmol/l) if above the 'normal' treatment line (P = 0.0136). A receiver operating characteristic showed that high acetaminophen concentrations were predictive of hypokalaemia (P = 0.0001 versus zero discriminatory line), and 4 hr acetaminophen concentration >156 mmol/l gave 81% sensitivity and 48% specificity. The risk of hypokalaemia after acute acetaminophen overdose depends on the extent of acetaminophen exposure, irrespective of N-acetylcysteine administration and independent of whether vomiting occurred. Acetaminophen appears to cause concentration-dependent hypokalaemia after overdose, and the pharmacological basis requires further consideration.
Complexity of the biological system output reflects the system's ability to adapt in a changing environment. Disease states and aging, which influence the adaptation of biological systems, modify the complexity of system response to environment changes. The alteration of motor adaptivity seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) has never been properly investigated by using the motor response complexity measured with sample entropy. We show here that the differences in the complexity of the involuntary movements can be efficiently used for the discrimination of the PD treatment state (non-dyskinetic/dyskinetic). We studied the complexity in the involuntary movements of three groups of subjects, normal, non-dyskinetic PD, and dyskinetic PD, by using the sample entropy for multiple time-scales. During experiments the subjects were standing with their arms extended in front of them while performing a cognitive task. PD subjects were tested after levodopa administration in their "best" ON condition. For all subject groups we found that the sample entropy increased almost linearly with the increase of the time-scale. The biggest increase was found in the dyskinetic PD and the least in non-dyskinetic PD subjects. This shows that system adaptivity, as revealed by the complexity analysis of postural displacement, is lower than normal in non-dyskinetic PD patients, but is abnormally increased in dyskinetic patients. The clear difference between the sample entropy-based measures for the non-dyskinetic and dyskinetic patients made possible the automatic, efficient recognition of the dyskinetic condition, based on multi-layer perceptrons.
We investigated the effect of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received NAC (10 mg/L) or water 4 days before ACTH/saline treatment for 13 days (prevention study). In a reversal study, NAC commenced on day 8 of ACTH/saline treatment and continued for 5 days. ACTH increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) in water drinking rats (111 +/- 1 to 131 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.001). In the prevention study, NAC + ACTH increased SBP (108 +/- 2 to 120 +/- 2 mmHg, p < 0.001) but less than ACTH alone (p' < 0.05). In the reversal study, NAC had no significant effect (132 +/- 4 to 124 +/- 3 mmHg, ns). Thus, NAC partially prevented but did not reverse ACTH-induced hypertension.
Reactivation of hepatitis is a serious complication of chemotherapy in hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. There are many reports of this in lymphoma patients but few in urological cancer patients. A 59-year-old woman with bladder cancer who was an HBV carrier developed severe liver dysfunction after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. The diagnosis was reactivation of hepatitis. She improved with administration of lamivudine with a steroid and is currently well without disease. Care should be taken about the risk of reactivation when performing chemotherapy in HBV carriers and prophylaxis by lamivudine should be considered.
Chorea in Huntington's Disease (HD) is usually treated with antidopaminergic neuroleptics like haloperidol, olanzapine and tiaprid or dopamine depleting drugs like tetrabenazine. Some patients with hyperkinesia, however, react to treatment with antidopaminergic drugs by developing extrapyramidal side effects. In earlier studies valproic acid showed no beneficial effect on involuntary choreatic movements. Myoclonus is rare in HD and is often overseen or misdiagnosed as chorea.
In this report, we present eight patients whose main symptom is myoclonic hyperkinesia. All patients were treated with valproic acid and scored by using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score before and after treatment. In addition to this, two patients agreed to be videotaped.
In seven patients myoclonus and, therefore the UHDRS motor score improved in a dose dependent manner. In three of these patients antidopaminergic medication could be reduced.
In the rare subgroup of HD patients suffering from myoclonic hyperkinesia, valproic acid is a possible alternative treatment.
The effects of physostigmine, tacrine and NIK-247 on scopolamine-induced impairment of a passive avoidance response were examined in rats. In addition, we investigated possible peripheral side-effects: miosis and salivation, and central side-effects: hypothermia and tremor which are mediated by cholinergic activation. Intraperitoneal injection of physostigmine reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg. Antiamnesic effects of oral administration of tacrine and NIK-247 were observed at doses of 0.3 and 0.1-0.3 mg/kg, respectively. Intraperitoneal injection of physostigmine induced miosis, salivation, hypothermia and tremor at doses > or = 0.1, 0.3, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Oral administration of tacrine (at doses > or = 0.3 mg/kg) and NIK-247 (at doses > or = 3 mg/kg) produced miosis. Tacrine (at doses > or = 1 mg/kg) and NIK-247 (at doses > or = 3 mg/kg) produced hypersalivation. Hypothermia and tremor were observed after administration of tacrine (at doses > or = 10 mg/kg) and NIK-247 (30 mg/kg). The antiamnesic dose of physostigmine was 1/30-1/3 of doses with central or peripheral side-effects. The dose ratio of tacrine was 1/30-1; that of NIK-247 was 1/300-1/10. These results indicate that NIK-247 has higher safety and greater selectivity for cognitive functions than physostigmine or tacrine.
Two children with developmental delay and seizure disorders had Fanconi syndrome associated with valproate therapy. Both recovered normal proximal tubular function within 4 months of discontinuing valproate therapy.
There has been little research into adverse reactions to proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole and its analogs) of suspected allergic etiology. We found nine studies in the medical literature and only two of these describe cross reactivity between proton pump inhibitors detected by skin prick tests.
We present a 24-year-old woman who twice developed total body pruritus and urticaria with facial angioedema 1-2 hours after ingesting an omeprazole capsule. In the second episode the patient also reported the sensation of having a lump in her throat.
Skin prick and intradermal tests were performed with omeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole, which were positive for the three proton pump inhibitors. For ethical reasons, oral challenge testing was not performed.
The clinical picture and the positive skin test results suggest an IgE-mediated mechanism. Skin prick tests may be useful for the diagnosis of cases of suspected allergy to omeprazole and its analogs. We found cross reactivity between three proton pump inhibitors detected by skin tests.
