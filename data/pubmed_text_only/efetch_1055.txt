The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the health economic benefits of using amlodipine in patients undergoing angioplasty procedures in Canada and Norway.
A decision tree model was constructed to find the total expected cost per patient for a 4-month time period following an initial angioplasty. The model used clinical data from the Coronary Angioplasty Amlodipine Restenosis Study (CAPARES), a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to investigate the effects of amlodipine on restenosis and clinical events in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Outcomes of interest to this analysis included MI, repeat PTCA, CABG, and all-cause mortality. Clinical experts from Canada and Norway were enlisted and a modified Delphi study approach was used to quantify healthcare resources consumed for each clinical outcome.
The use of amlodipine decreased the rates of MI, PTCA, and CABG by 2.0, 4.7, and 2.7%, respectively. The total expected cost per patient using amlodipine was $6,398.30 (US$4,323) in Canada and kr 59,993.27 (US$6,846) in Norway. The total expected cost per patient not using amlodipine was $6,519.37 (US$4,405) in Canada and kr 64,292.17 (US$7,337) in Norway. The model demonstrated potential cost-savings over a 4-month follow up period resulting from the improved clinical outcomes for patients using amlodipine with PTCA--$121,071 (US$81,844) per 1000 patients in Canada and kr 4,298,899 (US$490,074) per 1000 patients in Norway.
The adjunctive use of amlodipine is a cost-effective therapeutic strategy to achieve more favorable clinical outcomes in patients undergoing PTCAs in Canada and Norway.
Airway inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is characterized by accumulations of neutrophils in the airway and T cells in bronchial tissue, with activation of platelets in the circulation. CF patients are routinely treated with systemic or inhaled tobramycin for airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinical trials have indicated an anti-inflammatory effect of tobramycin beyond its bactericidal activity. Here, we investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of tobramycin in vitro and consider if these relate to the ability of tobramycin to bind copper, which is elevated in blood and sputum in CF.
A copper-tobramycin complex was synthesized. The effect of tobramycin and copper-tobramycin on neutrophil activation and migration of T cells and neutrophils across human lung microvascular endothelial cells in response to thrombin-activated platelets were investigated in vitro. Tobramycin uptake was detected by immunocytochemistry. Intracellular reactive oxygen species were detected using the fluorescent indicator, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA). Neutrophil superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and neutrophil elastase activity were measured using specific substrates. Copper was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy.
Tobramycin and copper-tobramycin were taken up by endothelial cells via a heparan sulphate-dependent mechanism and significantly inhibited T-cell and neutrophil transendothelial migration respectively. Copper-tobramycin has intracellular and extracellular superoxide dismutase-like activity. Neutrophil elastase inhibition by Î±1-antitrypsin is enhanced in the presence of copper-tobramycin. Tobramycin and copper-tobramycin are equally effective anti-pseudomonal antibiotics.
Anti-inflammatory effects of tobramycin in vivo may relate to the spontaneous formation of a copper-tobramycin complex, implying that copper-tobramycin may be more effective therapy.
Pretreatment regimens that decrease the incidence of fasciculations and postoperative myalgias have been the focus of many research studies. The subject of pretreatment remains controversial. An experimental double blind study was conducted of 50 patients, men and women, aged 18 to 65 years who were having elective minor orthopedic surgery. Group A participants (n = 24) received normal saline, and group B participants (n = 26) received atracurium 0.05 mg/kg, followed by succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg. Data that were collected included age, ASA physical status, weight, height, anesthesia and postanesthesia recovery times, type of procedure, medications administered, and allergies. Phase I of the study consisted of evaluation for the presence of fasciculations. In phase II, the intubation conditions (e.g., character of the vocal cords, presence of coughing, and degree of ease with laryngoscopy) were evaluated. Phase III included evaluation of postoperative myalgias at 24 and 72 hours. Data were analyzed using measures of central tendency, chi square, Pearson's r and the Student's t test. The incidence of fasciculations was less in the atracurium pretreatment group (group B) than in the group treated with normal saline (group A). Intubation conditions were not compromised by atracurium pretreatment. There was no statistically significant difference between group B and group A in postoperative myalgias. Thus, no recommendations for pretreatment can be made on the basis of this study.
Recently, we found that administration of glucosamine to adjuvant arthritis, a model for rheumatoid arthritis, suppressed the progression of arthritis in rats. To clarify its anti-inflammatory mechanism, we evaluated the actions of glucosamine on the activation of synoviocytes in vitro.
Synoviocytes isolated from human synovial tissues were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1beta in the presence of 0.01-1 mM glucosamine. IL-8 and prostaglandin (PG) E(2) were measured by ELISA, and nitric oxide was quantitated by Griess assay. IL-8 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Furthermore, the effect of glucosamine on the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the binding of [(125)I] IL-1beta to its receptors were examined using a primary human synovial cell line (CSABI- 479).
Glucosamine significantly suppressed the IL-1beta-induced IL-8 production as well as its mRNA expression (p < 0.05) at 1 mM. Furthermore, glucosamine (1 mM) inhibited the IL-1beta-induced nitric oxide and PGE(2) production (p < 0.05). Moreover, glucosamine suppressed the IL-1beta-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (p < 0.05 at >0.1 mM) and the IL-1beta-binding to its receptors (p < 0.05 at 1 mM).
These observations suggest that glucosamine can suppress the IL-1beta-mediated activation of synoviocytes (such as IL-8-, nitric oxide- and PGE(2)-production, and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK), thereby possibly exhibiting antiinflammatory actions in arthritis.
A case is reported where long term therapy with anticholinergic drugs caused choreiform movements in a 73-year-old man. After the therapy was ceased the movements disappeared. The elderly are particularly at risk from developing side effects from drug therapy. We believe this to be the first report of chorea produced by long-term therapy with benzhexol.
Estrogens have important roles in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer. They can have carcinogenic effects through stimulation of cell proliferation or formation of DNA-damaging species. To characterize model cell lines of endometrial cancer, we determined the expression profiles of the estrogen receptors (ERs) ESR1, ESR2 and GPER, and 23 estrogen biosynthetic and metabolic genes, and investigated estrogen biosynthesis in the control HIEEC cell line and the Ishikawa and HEC-1A EC cell lines. HIEEC and Ishikawa expressed all ERs to different extents, while HEC-1A cells lacked expression of ESR1. Considering the estrogen biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes, these cells showed statistically significant different gene expression profiles for SULT2B1, HSD3B2, CYP19A1, AKR1C3, HSD17B1, HSD17B7, HSD17B12, CYP1B1, CYP3A5, COMT, SULT1A1, GSTP1 and NQO2. In these cells, E2 was formed from E1S and E1, while androstenedione was not converted to estrogens. HIEEC and Ishikawa had similar profiles of androstenedione and E1 metabolism, but hydrolysis of E1S to E1 was weaker in Ishikawa cells. HEC-1A cells were less efficient for activation of E1 into the potent E2, but metabolized androstenedione to other androgenic metabolites better than HIEEC and Ishikawa cells. This study reveals that HIEEC, Ishikawa, and HEC-1A cells can all form estrogens only via the sulfatase pathway. HIEEC, Ishikawa, and HEC-1A cells expressed all the major genes in the production of hydroxyestrogens and estrogen quinones, and in their conjugation. Significantly higher CYP1B1 mRNA levels in Ishikawa cells compared to HEC-1A cells, together with lack of UGT2B7 expression, indicate that Ishikawa cells can accumulate more toxic estrogen-3,4-quinones than HEC-1A cells, as also for HIEEC cells. This study provides further characterization of HIEEC, Ishikawa, and HEC-1A cells, and shows that they differ greatly in expression of the genes investigated and in their capacity for E2 formation, and thus they represent different in vitro models.
High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is secreted by activated cells of the innate immune system and/or released by injured tissues and necrotic cells; HMGB1 up-regulates proinflammatory cytokines in several inflammatory diseases. Kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside (KP) was isolated from the leaves of cultivated mountain ginseng. KP has antitumor, antioxidative, antiallergic and antidiabetic activities, but the effects of KP on HMGB1-mediated proinflammatory responses have not been studied. In this study, we monitored the effect of KP on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated release of HMGB1 and the HMGB1-mediated modulation of proinflammatory responses in human endothelial cells. We found that KP potently inhibited the release of HMGB1 by LPS and inhibited LPS- or HMGB1-mediated barrier permeability and expression of cell adhesion molecules. Further studies revealed that KP inhibited cell surface receptor of HMGB1, toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4, but not the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Collectively, these results suggest that KP possesses anti-inflammatory responses against HMGB1-mediated proinflammatory responses, thereby endorsing its usefulness as a therapy for vascular inflammatory diseases.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematological stem cell disorder caused by increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow, and the accumulation of excessive white blood cells. Abelson tyrosine kinase (ABL) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth and proliferation and is usually under tight control. However, 95% of CML patients have the ABL gene from chromosome 9 fused with the breakpoint cluster (BCR) gene from chromosome 22, resulting in a short chromosome known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This Philadelphia chromosome is responsible for the production of BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that causes uncontrolled cellular proliferation. An ABL inhibitor, imatinib, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of CML, and is currently used as first line therapy. However, a high percentage of clinical relapse has been observed due to long term treatment with imatinib. A majority of these relapsed patients have several point mutations at and around the ATP binding pocket of the ABL kinase domain in BCR-ABL. In order to address the resistance of mutated BCR-ABL to imatinib, 2(nd) generation inhibitors such as dasatinib, and nilotinib were developed. These compounds were approved for the treatment of CML patients who are resistant to imatinib. All of the BCR-ABL mutants are inhibited by the 2(nd) generation inhibitors with the exception of the T315I mutant. Several 3(rd) generation inhibitors such as AP24534, VX-680 (MK-0457), PHA-739358, PPY-A, XL-228, SGX-70393, FTY720 and TG101113 are being developed to target the T315I mutation. The early results from these compounds are encouraging and it is anticipated that physicians will have additional drugs at their disposal for the treatment of patients with the mutated BCR-ABL-T315I. The success of these inhibitors has greater implication not only in CML, but also in other diseases driven by kinases where the mutated gatekeeper residue plays a major role.
The authors report in detail the case of a 27-year-old man who experienced sudden cardiac death 2 days after coprescription of the neuroleptic pimozide and the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin after the documentation of a prolonged QT interval. To determine the prevalence of this interaction, the authors referred to the Spontaneous Reporting System of the Food and Drug Administration and identified one similar case in which clarithromycin was coprescribed with pimozide and sudden cardiac death occurred shortly thereafter. In addition, the search identified 39 cases of cardiac arrhythmia associated with pimozide, 11 with pimozide alone, and 6 with clarithromycin alone, 1 of which had a positive rechallenge. The mechanism of the interaction between clarithromycin and pimozide seems to involve the inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of pimozide by the macrolide. The authors demonstrated that clarithromycin is able to inhibit the metabolism of pimozide in human liver microsomal preparations (K(i) = 7.65 +/- 1.18 microM) and that pimozide, but not clarithromycin or its primary metabolite, is able to prolong the electrocardiac QT interval in a dose-dependent manner in the isolated perfused rabbit heart. The increase was 9.6 +/- 1.1% in male hearts (N = 5) and 13.4 +/- 1.2% in female hearts (N = 4) (p < 0.05).
To further elucidate the mechanism and determine the biomarker of neuropathy induced by carbon disulfide (CS(2)), we performed a longitudinal observational study of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) in rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, spinal cord and serum after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of CS(2) administration. CS(2) exposure was found to markedly increase ROS and MDA levels in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, spinal cord and serum of rats in both time and symptom-dependent manners. Although SOD activities slightly increased, there was a decrease in the GSH contents and GSH-Px, CAT activities in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, spinal cord and serum after 2, 4, 8 or 12 weeks' CS(2) intoxication and at gait score of 2, 3, or 4. The activities of T-AOC also decreased in all three nerve tissues and serum as time went on and symptom developed. Furthermore, significant correlations between LPO and gait abnormality were observed as symptom developed. Oxidation stress also resulted in Ca(2+) concentrations and calmodulin (CaM) levels increases in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord. Thus, CS(2) intoxication was associated with elevation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reduction of antioxidant status, and the time and symptom-dependent changes of these indexes in rats' nerve tissues and serum suggested that ROS and concomitant LPO, at least in part, were involved in CS(2)-induced neuropathy.
Much recent effort has focused on identifying and characterizing cellular markers that distinguish tumor propagating cells (TPC) from more differentiated progeny. We report here an unusual promoter DNA methylation pattern for one such marker, the cell surface antigen CD133 (Prominin 1). This protein has been extensively used to enrich putative cancer propagating stem-like cell populations in epithelial tumors and, especially, glioblastomas. We find that, within individual cell lines of cultured colon cancers and glioblastomas, the promoter CpG island of CD133 is DNA methylated, primarily, in cells with absent or low expression of the marker protein, whereas lack of such methylation is evident in purely CD133+ cells. Differential histone modification marks of active versus repressed genes accompany these DNA methylation changes. This heterogeneous CpG island DNA methylation status in the tumors is unusual in that other DNA hypermethylated genes tested in such cultures preserve their methylation patterns between separated CD133+ and CD133- cell populations. Furthermore, the CD133 DNA methylation seems to constitute an abnormal promoter signature because it is not found in normal brain and colon but only in cultured and primary tumors. Thus, the DNA methylation is imposed on the transition between the active versus repressed transcription state for CD133 only in tumors. Our findings provide additional insight for the dynamics of aberrant DNA methylation associated with aberrant gene silencing in human tumors.
In mouse arteries, Alox15 [leukocyte-type 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO)] is assumed to regulate vascular function by metabolizing arachidonic acid (AA) to dilator eicosanoids that mediate the endothelium-dependent relaxations to AA and acetylcholine (ACh). We used Alox15(-/-) mice, made by targeted disruption of the Alox15 gene, to characterize its role in the regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone. Systolic blood pressures did not differ between wild-type (WT) and Alox15(-/-) mice between 8-12 wk of age, but Alox15(-/-) mice exhibited resistance toward both N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME)- and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/high-salt-induced hypertension. ACh relaxed mesenteric arteries and abdominal aortas of WT and Alox15(-/-) mice to an identical extent. The LO inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid attenuated the ACh relaxations by 35% in arteries from both WT and Alox15(-/-) mice. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of [(14)C]AA metabolites in aorta and peritoneal macrophages (PM) revealed differences. Unlike PM, aorta tissue did not produce detectable amounts of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Although Alox15 mRNA was detected in aorta, high-resolution gel electrophoresis with immunodetection revealed no Alox15 protein expression. Unlike aorta, Alox15 protein was detected in PM, intestine, fat, lung, spleen, and skin from WT, but not Alox15(-/-), mice. Injection of WT PM, a primary source of Alox15 protein, into Alox15(-/-) mice abolished their resistance toward L-NAME-induced hypertension. On the other hand, WT mice acquired resistance to L-NAME-induced hypertension after depletion of macrophages by clodronate injection. These studies indicate that Alox15 is involved in development of experimental hypertension by altering macrophage functions but not via synthesis of the vasoactive LO metabolites in mouse arteries.
Clinical cardiac abnormalities developed in 32 of 175 dogs that had various malignancies and were treated with doxorubicin: 31 dogs had electrocardiographic abnormalities including arrhythmias and nonspecific alterations in the R wave, ST segment, or QRS duration and 7 dogs had congestive heart failure. All seven dogs that had congestive heart failure died within 90 days. At necropsy, 13 of 32 affected dogs had noninflammatory myocardial degeneration, myocytolysis, vacuolation, and/or fibrosis and there was intramural coronary arteriosclerosis in all 13. Five dogs with lymphosarcoma were in complete clinical remission when they died of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, but the overall survival times of the lymphosarcoma subset was nevertheless longer than in previous studies. The clinical use of doxorubicin in the dog can cause cardiotoxicosis but the therapeutic benefit appears to outweigh risks in most dogs.
Heparin cofactor II (HCII) is a plasma protein that inhibits thrombin rapidly in the presence of dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, or heparin. HCII has been proposed to regulate coagulation or to participate in processes such as inflammation, atherosclerosis, and wound repair. To investigate the physiologic function of HCII, about 2 kb of the mouse HCII gene, encoding the N-terminal half of the protein, was deleted by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Crosses of F1 HCII(+/-) animals produced HCII(-/-) offspring at the expected mendelian frequency. Biochemical assays confirmed the absence of dermatan sulfate-dependent thrombin inhibition in the plasma of HCII(-/-) animals. Crosses of HCII(-/-) animals produced litters similar in size to those obtained from heterozygous matings. At 1 year of age, HCII-deficient animals were grossly indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates in weight and survival, and they did not appear to have spontaneous thrombosis or other morphologic abnormalities. In comparison with wild-type animals, however, they demonstrated a significantly shorter time to thrombotic occlusion of the carotid artery after photochemically induced endothelial cell injury. This abnormality was corrected by infusion of purified HCII but not ovalbumin. These observations suggest that HCII might inhibit thrombosis in the arterial circulation.
This study evaluated anticholinergic effects among patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar I disorder who were receiving either olanzapine (N = 12) or clozapine (N = 12) at standard clinical doses in a naturalistic setting. Serum anticholinergic levels were determined in adult male and female subjects using a radioreceptor binding assay. The Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser Scale was used to evaluate anticholinergic side effects clinically, and the Mini-Mental State Examination provided a global cognitive measure. Patients had achieved target doses that were stable at the time at which blood samples were obtained, and no other concomitant medicine with known anticholinergic potential was allowed. Patients receiving olanzapine (average dose, 15 mg/day) had serum anticholinergic levels of 0.96 (+/-0.55) pmol/ atropine equivalents compared with levels of 5.47 (+/-3.33) pmol/atropine equivalents for those receiving clozapine (average dose, 444 mg/day) (p < 0.001). Rates of increased and decreased salivation were significantly more common among the clozapine- and olanzapine-treated patients, respectively, whereas constipation, urinary disturbances, and tachycardia/palpitations were significantly more common among clozapine-treated patients. Neither group showed any global cognitive deficits. Olanzapine-treated patients had serum anticholinergic levels that were less than one fifth those of the clozapine-treated patients. Furthermore, clinical evaluations confirmed that clozapine-treated patients experienced more frequent and severe anticholinergic side effects (except dry mouth). However, none of the patients in either group expressed any desire to discontinue these medications as a result of the anticholinergic side effects.
A 64-year-old man with chronic renal insufficiency was hospitalized with dysphagia and inability to keep his head erect 11 months after beginning procainamide hydrochloride (PA) for control of atrial flutter. Evaluation revealed esophageal dysmotility, worsening renal function, and elevated serum PA and N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) concentrations. No evidence of autoimmune myasthenia gravis was found. PA was discontinued and normalization of PA and NAPA concentrations was associated with a decrease in muscle weakness and resolution of dysphagia. The correlation between clinical findings and serum concentrations of PA and NAPA suggests that drug excess due to impaired clearance was the basis for this unusual adverse drug reaction.
Significant reduction of renal mass causes progressive deterioration of renal function and structure which is mediated by systemic and glomerular hypertension, hyperfiltration, oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia. Niacin is known to improve lipid metabolism and exert antioxidant/anti-inflammatory actions. Therefore, we considered that niacin supplementation may attenuate oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue injury in the remnant kidney. To this end, 56 nephrectomized [chronic kidney disease (CKD)] rats were randomly assigned to niacin-treated (50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) in the drinking water for 12 wk) and untreated groups. Sham-operated rats served as controls. The untreated CKD rats exhibited azotemia, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, upregulation of MCP-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, and NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX-4, gp91(phox), p47(phox) and p22(phox) subunits) and activation of NF-kappaB (IkappaB phosphorylation). Niacin administration reduced MCP-1, PAI-1, TGF-beta, p47(phox), p22(phox), COX-1, and NF-kappaB activation, ameliorated hypertension, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial injury. Although niacin lowered serum creatinine and raised creatinine clearance, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Thus niacin supplementation helps to attenuate histological injury and mitigate upregulation of oxidative and inflammatory systems in the remnant kidney.
No data are available on the role of HER2 overexpression in predicting the efficacy of dose-dense anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. We retrospectively evaluated this role in patients enrolled in a phase III study comparing standard FEC21 (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, administered every 3 weeks) vs dose-dense FEC14 (the same regimen repeated every 2 weeks). HER2 status was determined for 731 of 1214 patients. Statistical analyses were performed to test for interaction between treatment and HER2 status with respect to event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS); EFS and OS were compared within each HER2 subgroup and within each treatment arm. Median follow-up was 6.7 years. Among FEC21-treated patients, both EFS (HR=2.07; 95% CI 1.27-3.38) and OS (HR=2.47; 95% CI 1.34-4.57) were significantly worse in HER2 + patients than in HER2 - patients. Among FEC14-treated patients, differences in either EFS (HR=1.21; 95% CI 0.65-2.24) or OS (HR=1.85; 95% CI 0.88-3.89) between HER2 + and HER2 - patients were not statistically significant. Interaction analysis suggested that the use of dose-dense FEC14 might remove the negative prognostic effect of HER2 overexpression on EFS and OS. Our data suggest a potential role of HER-2 overexpression in predicting the efficacy of dose-dense epirubicin-containing chemotherapy and the need to confirm this hypothesis in future prospective studies.
Seizures have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin (LVFX). In the present study, we investigated the effects of experimental renal failure and the concomitant treatment with ganciclovir on the pharmacodynamics of LVFX-induced seizures to identify whether these factors can alter the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamics of LVFX. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of LVFX at 250, 500, or 1000 mg/h/rat until the onset of seizures, and samples of serum, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained. The concentration of LVFX in CSF at the onset of seizures was not affected by the infusion rate, whereas that in serum and brain increased with increasing infusion rate. This suggests that the concentration of LVFX in CSF is an appropriate index of the drug concentration at the site of action. The concentration of LVFX in CSF at the onset of seizures was significantly lower in rats with renal failure than in the control rats. Pretreatment with methylguanidine, an uremic toxin, at 600 mg/h/rat for 8 min reduced the concentration of LVFX in CSF at the onset of seizures and the total body clearance of LVFX after the intravenous injection. In rats pretreated with ganciclovir at 500 mg/h/rat for 1 h, the concentration of LVFX in CSF at the onset of seizures was significantly lower than the control rats. These results suggest that renal failure and ganciclovir can be the risk factors for LVFX-induced seizures, and that they increase the sensitivity of the central nervous system to LVFX-induced seizures.
Hepatoma is the leading cause of death in male cancer patients in Taiwan. In this study, we examined the effect of Paclitaxel on the in vitro growth of 2 rodent and 4 human hepatoma cell lines. Differential Paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity was observed among hepatoma cell lines. In Paclitaxel-sensitive Hep3B and N1S1 cells, Paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity was dose- and time-dependent. The effective doses of Paclitaxel were in the range 0.1-1.0 microM. Flow cytometric analysis showed that Paclitaxel-treated hepatoma cells were arrested in G2-M phases prior to apoptosis. In addition, growth inhibition by Paclitaxel was accompanied by an increase in the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in hepatoma cells. For Paclitaxel-resistant hepatoma cells, cytostatic response and/or polyploidization was observed. Our results indicated that two thirds of the hepatoma cell lines examined showed some degree of resistance to Paclitaxel treatment in vitro. The expression of p53 gene had no direct effect on Paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity. The expression of PCNA and the development of polyploidization appear to be good markers for measuring Paclitaxel response. These findings suggest that Paclitaxel alone appears to by cytostatic to hepatoma cells, combination of Paclitaxel with other chemotherapeutic agents may show better cytotoxic effects.
The non-steroidal antiandrogen flutamide is widely used for treatment of prostatic cancer, but causes side effects, including cholestatic hepatitis and fulminant hepatitis. We investigated the pathogenesis of flutamide-induced cholestatic hepatitis, focusing on the bile salt export pump (BSEP; ABCB11), which exports bile salts to the bile. We examined the inhibitory effects of flutamide and its active metabolite, hydroxyflutamide, on the transport of taurocholic acid (TCA) by membrane vesicles derived from hBSEP-expressing Sf9 cells. Flutamide inhibited the transport of TCA by hBSEP (IC50 value, about 50 microM), while hydroxyflutamide had no effect at up to 100 microM. When flutamide was administered to rats as a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg, the biliary excretion rate of bolus-injected [3H]TCA was decreased and the liver tissue concentration of flutamide exceeded 50 microM. Repeated doses of flutamide for 5 d (10 mg/kg/d) also decreased the biliary excretion rate of bolus-injected [3H]TCA. In this case, the liver tissue concentration of flutamide was below 0.1 microM. In both cases, no change in the mRNA level of rat Bsep was detected by RT-PCR. These results suggest that flutamide itself, but not its major metabolite, may cause cholestasis by inhibiting BSEP-mediated bile salt excretion.
Acute pulmonary arterial hypertension in acute lung injury aggravates the clinical course and complicates treatment. Increased release and turnover of endogenous endothelin-1 is known to be a major determinant in the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension of various etiologies. We tested whether intravenous tezosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, reduced pulmonary artery pressure in a pig model of acute lung injury induced by meconium aspiration. Acute pulmonary arterial hypertension was induced in 12 anesthetized and instrumented pigs by instillation of human pooled meconium in a 20% solution. Hemodynamic and gas exchange parameters were recorded every 30 min. Six animals received tezosentan 5 mg/kg after 0 and 90 min; six animals served as controls. Tezosentan led to a decrease of mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) from 33.4 +/- 4.0 mm Hg to 24.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) from 7.8 +/- 1.4 mm Hg.L(-1).min.m2 to 5.2 +/- 0.7 mm Hg.L(-1).min.m2. All animals treated with tezosentan survived, whereas in the control group four out of six animals died. Tezosentan improved survival and decreased pulmonary artery pressure in a porcine model of acute pulmonary arterial hypertension after meconium aspiration. Tezosentan has the potential for effective pharmacological treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension following acute lung injury.
Variants in genes involved in warfarin metabolism and sensitivity affect individual warfarin requirements and the risk for bleeding. Testing for these variant alleles might allow more personalized dosing of warfarin during the induction phase. In 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration changed the labeling for warfarin (Coumadin, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey), suggesting that clinicians consider genetic testing before initiating therapy.

Genotype-guided dosing consisting of genotyping for CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and/or VKORC1 versus standard warfarin induction.
Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs were in 2007 U.S. dollars.
In the base case, genotype-guided dosing resulted in better outcomes, but at a relatively high cost. Overall, the marginal cost-effectiveness of testing exceeded $170 000 per QALY. On the basis of current data and cost of testing (about $400), there is only a 10% chance that genotype-guided dosing is likely to be cost-effective (that is, <$50 000 per QALY). Sensitivity analyses revealed that for genetic testing to cost less than $50 000 per QALY, it would have to be restricted to patients at high risk for hemorrhage or meet the following optimistic criteria: prevent greater than 32% of major bleeding events, be available within 24 hours, and cost less than $200.
Few published studies describe the effect of genotype-guided dosing on major bleeding events, and although these studies show a trend toward decreased bleeding, the results are not statistically significant.
Warfarin-related genotyping is unlikely to be cost-effective for typical patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, but may be cost-effective in patients at high risk for hemorrhage who are starting warfarin therapy.
Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen used in the treatment of breast cancer, was assessed for carcinogenic potential in the two-stage model of experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. Groups of female Fisher F344 rats were initiated with a non-necrogenic, subcarcinogenic dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 10 mg/kg, po) and fed tamoxifen at a concentration of 250 mg per kg of AIN-76A diet for 6 or 15 months. The livers of these animals exhibited an increase in size and number of altered hepatic foci compared with those animals which were initiated with DEN but not exposed to tamoxifen. This finding indicates that tamoxifen may have a carcinogenic potential in the rat liver. After 6 months of treatment, neoplastic nodules were observed in 3/8 rats in the DEN-initiated, tamoxifen-treated group. In the initiated group provided with tamoxifen for 15 months, neoplastic nodules were observed in 7/8 rats and hepatocellular carcinomas in 3/8 rats. The serum level of tamoxifen in these rats was 200-300 ng/ml. The ratio of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, and N-desmethyl tamoxifen was 1:0.1:0.5-1 in the serum. When adjusted for age-related weight increases, the serum and liver levels of tamoxifen and its N-desmethyl metabolite did not change over the 15 months. In the rat liver, the level of tamoxifen and its N-desmethyl metabolite was 10-29 micrograms/g liver after 6 or 15 months of chronic dietary administration. The ratio of tamoxifen:4-hydroxy tamoxifen:N-desmethyl tamoxifen was 1:0.1.3-3.3 in the liver. Therefore, the liver had 20- to 30-fold more tamoxifen and 4-hydroxy tamoxifen and at least 100-fold more N-desmethyl tamoxifen than the serum (assuming 1 gram of tissue is equivalent to 1 ml of serum). These results indicate that tamoxifen is a promoting agent for the rat liver at serum levels found in patients given the usual therapeutic course of tamoxifen. The high concentrations of tamoxifen attained in the rat liver indicate that actions other than its known estrogenicity for liver could contribute to its promoting action. In addition, these results indicate that the pharmacodynamic differences in tamoxifen metabolism in rats and humans and at low versus high doses should be determined. Thus, the therapeutic indications for tamoxifen should be balanced by the potential risk it may present as a promoting agent in mammalian liver.
Tamoxifen citrate is a synthetic antiestrogen that provides survival benefit when given as adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Venous thrombophlebitis may complicate tamoxifen treatment at a rate of approximately one per 800 treatment-years. To explore the possible procoagulant effects associated with tamoxifen therapy we evaluated changes in protein S and C activity levels in 58 postmenopausal women with surgically resected breast cancer who were disease-free and participating in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized toxicity study of tamoxifen. The changes in protein C activities for the tamoxifen group (mean level = 113%) compared to those in the placebo group (mean level = 115%) were not significant (p = 0.45). Protein S activity levels increased while protein C activity levels decreased from baseline at 24 months in both tamoxifen and placebo groups. We conclude that the possible thrombophlebitis-promoting effect of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women is unlikely to be explained on the basis of protein S and protein C activity level changes.
Plasma opioid peptides, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and blood pressure (BP) were assessed in 24 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with acute respiratory failure. Hypoxemic-hypercapnic patients had high BP, beta-endorphin, Met-enkephalin and dynorphin B, whereas hypoxemic-normocapnic and hypoxemic-hypocapnic patients showed normal BP, high beta-endorphin, and normal Met-enkephalin and dynorphin B. Norepinephrine and ANF were high in all patients, particularly in hypoxemic-hypercapnic patients. Infusion with the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride significantly increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) in hypoxemic-hypercapnic (182.0 +/- 3.2 versus 205.1 +/- 3.0 mmHg; P < 0.01), hypoxemic-normocapnic (149.3 +/- 1.8 versus 169.1 +/- 2.2 mmHg; P < 0.01) and hypoxemic-hypocapnic (147.3 +/- 1.3 versus 166.8 +/- 2.2 mmHg; P < 0.01) patients, norepinephrine in hypoxemic-hypercapnic patients (3583.2 +/- 371.8 versus 5371.3 +/- 260.0 fmol/ml; P < 0.01), and reduced ANF in hypoxemic-normocapnic (18.3 +/- 0.8 versus 11.9 +/- 1.0 fmol/ml; P < 0.05) and hypoxemic-hypocapnic (18.1 +/- 1.2 versus 12.1 +/- 2.1 fmol/ml; P < 0.05) patients. These results indicate that the endogenous opioid system attenuates SBP responses in acute respiratory failure by affecting norepinephrine or ANF release.
