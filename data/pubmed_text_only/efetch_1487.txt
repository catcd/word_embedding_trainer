We report two case histories of previously healthy patients who both developed persistent dyskinetic syndromes (spasmodic torticollis and cranial dystonia, respectively) following the intake of norpseudoephedrine (NPE) as an appetite suppressant. The symptoms took a chronic course even after NPE intake was discontinued. Similar drug-induced dyskinesias have been described for amphetamine and neuroleptic drugs. This side effect has, however, not yet been reported for NPE, which is pharmacologically related to amphetamine. One of the patients may also have had multiple sclerosis. Structural lesions in the basal ganglia area might predispose the development of such a movement disorder. The potential relationship between NPE intake and the development of dyskinesia is discussed. Appetite suppressants, often taken without the neurologist's knowledge, may be the cause of dyskinetic syndromes.
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) are disorders that are common and disturbing to uremic patients. The treatment of these is problematic. Eight patients on chronic hemodialysis and continuous peritoneal dialysis completed a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study using incremental doses of pergolide up to 0.25 mg at bedtime for treatment of RLS and sleep disruption. Five patients (62.5%) noted subjective improvement in restless legs symptoms and sleep quality. Objective results were improved only slightly by treatment. The percentage of the first hour in bed during which leg movements occurred decreased from 20.5 +/- 6.0 to 11.5 +/- 3.3, p < 0.05. However, findings during sleep were less positive. The following measures were not significant between placebo and treatment: leg movements per hour of sleep [53.7 +/- 22.3 vs 35.8 +/- 11.8 (p = 0.2)]; and percentage of sleep time spent with leg movements [5.5% +/- 3.2 vs 4.4% +/- 1.4 (p = 0.37)]. Patients continued to have very disrupted sleep, and we could not document an objective improvement in sleep architecture. Thus, although pergolide at the dose of 0.25 mg at bedtime provided subjective improvement in symptoms of restless legs and quality of sleep, and objectively decreased leg movements during the first hour in bed, objectively sleep continued to be disrupted. In this small patient group, the response to pergolide was not uniform, and further investigation is required to test effectiveness at higher doses.
Amphetamine is one of the most common illicitly abused drugs in certain countries. It is a potent sympathomimetic that may lead to vascular events, including stroke and myocardial infarction. Most reports of stroke after amphetamine abuse are of intracerebral hemorrhage. In this report, the authors describe a ruptured aneurysm of the right internal carotid artery in a young man with amphetamine abuse. It grew rapidly within 2 weeks. Surgery revealed fibrosis and fibrinoid necrosis around the aneurysm. The aneurysm was successfully embolized with Guglielmi detachable coil. A rapidly growing aneurysm in the major intracranial vessels resulting from amphetamine abuse is very rare.
Various studies have demonstrated a relationship between nephrolithiasis and the ingestion of certain drugs. We are particularly interested in the effects of triamterene. Five published case studies on patients of both sexes between 43 and 60 years of age have proven that a regular consumption of normal doses of triamterene has a direct effect upon the formation of renal stones. The stones analysed by infra-red spectrophotometry during the above observations contained from 20 to 100% of triamterene and it's metabolite hydroxytriamterene, following a daily consumption of 150 to 350 mg during a period of 6 to 38 months. It has been confirmed that triamterene and it's metabolite hydroxytriamterene are very poorly soluble and super-saturate the urine for a brief period following the ingestion of the drug. Triamterene might also intervene in the initial phenomena of nucleation. It is therefore recommended that triamterene be used with caution in those patients presenting a history of nephrolithiasis. The existence of drug induced nephrolithiasis reinforces the importance of the technique of renal stone analysis, and the necessity of a systematic study of all renal stones found. This will allow us to develop the study of the correlations between the different episodes of renal stone disease, the nature of the treatment undertaken and the systematic analysis, layer by layer, of the stone.
Isradipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-entry blocker. Previous controlled and blinded trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of isradipine in lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The purpose of this study was to reassess this safety and efficacy in a large number of patients in an open-label, long-term, multicenter trial. A total of 501 patients with essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg) received 5 to 10 mg/d of isradipine in two divided doses for a period of 32 weeks. The mean dose used was 7.4 mg/d with titration at week 4 from 5 mg/d (2.5 mg BID) to 10 mg/d (5 mg BID) if the diastolic pressure was still > 90 mm Hg. After 32 weeks of isradipine treatment, systolic blood pressure decreased from 154.9 +/- 16.4 mm Hg to 140.2 +/- 13.9 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and diastolic pressure from 101.2 +/- 5.2 mm Hg to 86.6 +/- 7.9 mm Hg (P < 0.001). This monotherapy was successful in reducing diastolic blood pressure > 10 mm Hg in 62.5% of the patients. Significant adverse effects were noted in 92 (18.4%) of the 501 patients; only 30 (6.0%) withdrew from the study because of adverse events. In this large, long-term, community-based study, isradipine was effective and well tolerated in most patients.
The efficacy and tolerability of extended-release felodipine (felodipine-ER) and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (nifedipine GITS) were compared in a multicenter, prospective, open-label clinical trial of 277 patients with mild-to-moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [SiDBP] > or = 95 and < or = 115 mm Hg). After a 3-week washout period, patients were randomized to receive felodipine-ER (5 mg once daily) or nifedipine GITS (30 mg once daily); during a subsequent 6-week titration phase, the once-daily felodipine-ER dose could be increased to 10 mg and the nifedipine GITS dose to 60 or 90 mg in an attempt to achieve adequate blood pressure response (SiDBP < or = 90 mm Hg, or < 100 mm Hg with a > 10-mm Hg reduction from baseline, as measured 24 hours after dosing [trough]). At the end of titration, the mean daily doses of felodipine-ER and nifedipine GITS were 8 and 50 mg, respectively. Mean changes in sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP)/SiDBP were -14/-12 and -16/-13 mm Hg, respectively. All reductions were significant when compared with baseline (P < 0.01), but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. Adequate blood pressure response occurred in 77% of the felodipine-ER group and 80% of the nifedipine GITS group; this difference was not significant. Blood pressure changes were similar among sex and race subgroups. A higher percentage of older patients (> 55 years of age) than younger patients (< or = 55 years of age) reached goal SiDBP with both drugs. Patients with adequate SiDBP response continued receiving their assigned medication for an additional 6-week maintenance period. Reductions in SiDBP and SiSBP from baseline continued to be significant in both treatment groups. No clinically important changes in heart rate were noted. A total of 28 patients (15 in the felodipine-ER group and 13 in the nifedipine GITS group) withdrew from the study because of inadequate blood pressure response. At least one adverse experience occurred in 55% of the felodipine-ER group and 63% of the nifedipine GITS group, prompting withdrawal of 14 patients (10%) and 16 patients (11%), respectively. Headache and edema were the most common adverse experiences. The incidence and pattern of adverse experiences did not differ significantly between treatments. The results of this study demonstrate that once-daily felodipine-ER and nifedipine GITS are similarly highly effective and generally well tolerated in patients with essential hypertension.
To compare sexual functioning in patients treated with quetiapine or risperidone.
This open-label study included patients with schizophrenia or a related psychotic illness who were randomized to quetiapine (200-1200 mg/d) or risperidone (1-6 mg/d) for 6 weeks. Sexual dysfunction was assessed by a semistructured interview, the Antipsychotics and Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (ASFQ), based upon the Utvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU).
Four of 25 quetiapine-treated patients (16%) and 12 of 24 risperidone-treated patients (50%) reported sexual dysfunction (chi 2 = 6.4; df = 1; P = 0.006) on the ASFQ. Six patients (11.7%; 4 on risperidone, 2 on quetiapine) spontaneously reported sexual dysfunction. The mean+/-SD dose was 580+/-224 mg/d for quetiapine and 3.2 +/- 1.3 mg/d for risperidone. Mean +/- SD prolactin levels in quetiapine- and risperidone-treated patients were 13.8 +/- 17.9 and 57.7 +/- 39.7 ng/mL, respectively.
Sexual dysfunction was less common in patients treated with quetiapine than with risperidone. Direct questioning about sexual functioning is necessary to avoid underestimating the frequency of sexual side effects in patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.
Rapid lowering of blood pressure can precipitate or worsen ischemic strokes. This usually has been observed in the setting of profoundly lowered pressure and hypotension. We report on six patients in whom ischemic neurologic injury ensued or worsened after moderate reduction of blood pressure by pharmacological treatment. The 6 patients suffered new or worsened ischemic neurologic deficits after receiving oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications, mostly after relatively small doses. Mean arterial blood pressure in these patients was decreased by 25 +/- 7.7%, or 37 +/- 16 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) without resultant hypotension. These cases emphasize the potential hazards of moderate blood pressure reduction by antihypertensive medications in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), as well as rapidly treated hypertension even in those who have not yet manifested ischemic symptoms.
Thymidylate synthase (TS) is the primary target of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). A VNTR polymorphism in the TS promoter region is associated with the efficacy of 5-FU-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. A common G>C SNP at the 12th nucleotide of the second repeat in the TS*3 alleles has been recently described. The combination of SNP and VNTR allows the definition of 3 TS alleles: *2, *3G and *3C. The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive value of clinical response and survival of these new defined TS alleles. TS genotypes of 89 patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer and undergoing 5-FU-based chemotherapy were carried out. The clinical outcome was evaluated according to the genotype (high expression genotype: *2R/*3G; *3C/*3G; *3G/*3G; and low expression genotype: *2R/*2R; *2R/*3C; *3C/*3C. A higher overall response was observed in the group of patients with a low expression genotype (p = 0.035). The probability of achieving a clinical response of patients with a low expression-related genotype was 2.9 higher than that of the other group (95% CI = 1.03-5.6, p = 0.04). The median time to progression was 12 months and 9 months in the low and high expression groups, respectively (p = 0.07, log rank test). Overall survival was significantly longer in the low expression group. In this group the median OS was not achieved at 50 months of follow-up in contrast to the 20 months observed in the high expression group (p = 0.03). TS genotype was an independent predictor of progression-free and overall survival in the Cox regression models after adjustment to the other clinical variables. The selection of patients who are likely to respond to 5-FU therapy may be considerably improved if the TS genotype were to include both the VNTR and the SNP located within the promoter region of the gene.
Five rapid-cycling manic patients developed neurotoxic syndromes when treated with a combination of lithium and carbamazepine, although all five had therapeutic plasma levels of both drugs. The risk factors for development of neurotoxicity with this drug combination are discussed.
Glucocorticoids are important regulators of lipid homeostasis, and chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels induce hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and visceral obesity. The occupied glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a transcription factor. However, those genes regulating lipid metabolism under GR control are not fully known. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4, fasting-induced adipose factor), a protein inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase, is synthesized and secreted during fasting, when circulating glucocorticoid levels are physiologically increased. We therefore tested whether the ANGPTL4 gene (Angptl4) is transcriptionally controlled by GR. We show that treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone increased Angptl4 mRNA levels in primary hepatocytes and adipocytes (2-3-fold) and in the livers and white adipose tissue of mice (approximately 4-fold). We tested the mechanism of this increase in H4IIE hepatoma cells and found that dexamethasone treatment increased the transcriptional rate of Angptl4. Using bioinformatics and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified a GR binding site within the rat Angptl4 sequence. A reporter plasmid containing this site was markedly activated by dexamethasone, indicative of a functional glucocorticoid response element. Dexamethasone treatment also increased histone H4 acetylation and DNase I accessibility in genomic regions near this site, further supporting that it is a glucocorticoid response element. Glucocorticoids promote the flux of triglycerides from white adipose tissue to liver. We found that mice lacking ANGPTL4 (Angptl4(-/-)) had reductions in dexamethasone-induced hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis, suggesting that ANGPTL4 is required for this flux. Overall, we establish that ANGPTL4 is a direct GR target that participates in glucocorticoid-regulated triglyceride metabolism.
Thyroxine synthesis inhibitors increase the predisposition to catalepsy and decrease sexual motivation and the amplitude of the acoustic startle reflex in rats. The sensitivity of these behavioral changes to antidepressants remains uncertain. Chronic administration of the classical tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (15 mg/kg, 21 days) prevented the appearance of high sensitivity to catalepsy and the decrease in sexual motivation in Wistar rats given propylthiouracil (50 mg/liter, 28 days), without altering the amplitude of the startle reflex. Normalization of behavior in response to imipramine was not associated with changes in movement activity in the open field test or the animals' body weight. There was also no change in the expression of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor gene in the frontal cortex. The model of propylthiouracilinduced catalepsy with reduced sexual motivation in rats has potential for studying the role of thyroid abnormalities in the development of depression and the mechanisms of action of antidepressants.
A high fat intake has been associated with prostate cancer risk, and gene polymorphisms of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) play an important role in plasma lipoprotein metabolism. We herein analyzed the association of LPL gene polymorphisms with the risk of prostate cancer in a Japanese population. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LPL designated as Ser447stop, HindIII and PvuII were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 273 prostate cancer patients, 205 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and 230 male controls. The men with the CG + GG genotypes of the Ser447stop polymorphism had an increased risk of prostate cancer compared to those with the CC genotype [age-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.625; 95% CI = 1.068-2.471; p = 0.023]. Furthermore, the increased risk associated with the CG + GG genotypes was more strongly observed in patients with high-grade cancers (aOR = 2.843; 95% CI = 1.252-6.458; p = 0.039) or metastatic diseases (aOR = 2.300; 95% CI = 1.042-5.074; p = 0.013), whereas the risk was not significant in those with low- to intermediate-grade cancers or nonmetastatic diseases. In the HindIII and PvuII polymorphisms, there was no significant difference between the prostate cancer patients and the controls, and no significant results as for tumor grade and stage. None of the 3 polymorphisms showed any association with the risk of BPH. Our results suggest that the LPL Ser447stop polymorphism is a common genetic modifier for the development of prostate cancer, particularly that of high-grade and/or high-stage, in a Japanese population.
A progressive dementia syndrome (DSM IV) with frontal-subcortical features developed in a 72-year-old woman during valproate therapy (Depakine). Discontinuation of valproate resulted in complete recovery. Drugs are a common cause of reversible dementia. The association of dementia with valproate therapy is rare. Features of a subcortical dementia are indicative of a reversible cause. In addition, the possible role of drugs should always be considered in patients with cognitive decline.
In mice, administration of the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor miglustat results in reversible infertility, characterized by impaired sperm motility and markedly abnormal sperm morphology. This observation suggested that miglustat might have utility for fertility control in man. To ascertain the impact of miglustat on human spermatogenesis, we conducted a pilot study of miglustat administration in normal men.
After a 2-week baseline period, seven normal men were administered miglustat 100 mg, orally, twice daily for 6 weeks. During treatment, subjects had frequent seminal fluid analyses to assess the impact of treatment on sperm concentration, motility and morphology and the ability to undergo the acrosome reaction by in vitro assays.
Five subjects completed all aspects of the study. In these subjects, there was no apparent effect of miglustat on sperm concentration, motility or sperm morphology after 6 weeks of therapy. In addition, no changes in acrosome structure or function were observed with treatment, despite therapeutic concentrations of miglustat in the serum and seminal plasma. All subjects experienced gastrointestinal upset, diarrhoea and mild weight loss during treatment. No other abnormalities in blood counts, serum chemistries, vision or overall health were observed.
In contrast to the observations in mice, the oral administration of miglustat does not appear to affect human spermatogenesis. Further elucidation of the mechanism underlying the species specificity of miglustat may improve our understanding of the role of glycosphingolipids in spermatogenesis and result in alternative approaches to male fertility control.
To determine how well tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporin A (CsA) are tolerated after HLA-identical blood stem cell transplantation, we performed a retrospective review of 87 adults transplanted consecutively who received FK506 (n = 40) or CsA (n = 47) in a nonrandomized fashion in combination with methylprednisolone for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and compared the incidences of complications potentially related to the immunosuppressive agents. Pre-transplant demographic characteristics, drug compliance and rates of acute GVHD were comparable for the two groups. Following first discharge, fewer patients in the FK506 group required antihypertensive therapy (32 vs 59%, P = 0.022), but more required insulin (34 vs 10%, P = 0.014). There was also a trend for more hyperkalemia and less moderate-to-severe venoocclusive disease in the FK506 group. However, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and cytomegaloviral or fungal infections through the first 100 days post-transplant did not differ significantly between the two groups. We conclude that for allogeneic blood stem cell transplant recipients, the incidence of complications related to FK506 and CsA in equally effective dose schedules in combination with methylprednisolone are similar with the exception of the risks of hypertension and hyperglycemia.
Doxorubicin is one of the most active cytotoxic agents in current use. It has proven efficacy in various malignancies either alone or combined with other cytocidal agents. The clinical usefulness of the anthracycline drug has been precluded by cardiac toxicity. Many therapeutic interventions have been attempted to improve the therapeutic benefits of the drug. Few, however, have been efficacious in this setting.
We have addressed in the current study the possible protective effects of naringenin, a flavonoid known to have anti-oxidant properties, on doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in male Swiss albino rats.
Forty male Swiss albino rats were used in this study. Naringenin (25 mg/kg body weight) was administered daily by gavage for 7 consecutive days before a cumulative single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg body weight, ip).
Doxorubicin induced marked biochemical alterations characteristic of cardiac toxicity including, elevated activities of serum total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), enhanced lipid peroxidation measured as malondialdehyde (MDA). The anthracycline drug has also reduced the cardiac enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT). Besides, it reduced significantly the reduced glutathione (GSH) level, but it increased the total NO content in heart tissue. Prior administration of naringenin ahead of doxorubicin challenge ameliorated all these biochemical markers.
Taken together, one could conclude that naringenin has a protective role in the abatement of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity that resides, at least in part, on its anti-radical effects and regulatory role on NO production.
Rats were implanted with chronic electrodes to stimulate the perforant path and record the elicited monosynaptic evoked potentials from the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Dentate responses were examined in awake and anesthetized animals after exposure to saline and aminophylline (100 mg/kg, IP). In the awake animal, aminophylline treatment did not significantly alter the threshold or elicited amplitude of either the excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) or the population spike (PS). Aminophylline pretreatment markedly enhanced the length and severity of elicited seizures from hippocampal (dentate gyrus) or perforant pathway stimulation. After daily perforant pathway stimulations which established "kindled" seizures, aminophylline significantly increased only the amplitude of the evoked PS in awake animals. In animals anesthetized with chloropent, aminophylline increased significantly before kindling the amplitude of both the EPSP and PS without effecting thresholds for each. After perforant pathway kindling, only the PS amplitude was increased significantly by aminophylline. Inhibition, thought to be from GABA-mediated recurrent collaterals, was found to be increased rather than decreased by kindling. Further, aminophylline treatment did not result in reduction of this inhibition before or after kindling. These data suggest that at this dose of aminophylline neither enhanced transmitter release at this synapse as measured by the amplitude of the EPSP, nor reduced recurrent collateral inhibition significantly contributed to the prolongation of elicited seizure afterdischarge. The increase in PS amplitude reflecting an increased number of granule cells excited to discharge with perforant path stimulation after aminophylline was noted in awake animals but was greatest in the anesthetized animals. Although the number of granule cells excited to discharge was increased by aminophylline, the small increase in amplitude seen compared to the effects of other neurotoxins on this synapse makes this an unlikely explanation for the profound increased seizure response seen after aminophylline.
We investigated hypocholesterolemic mechanisms of linalool, an aromatic anti-oxidative monoterpene, which is abundant in teas and essential oils. Oral administration of linalool to mice for 6 weeks significantly lowered total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and HMG-CoA reductase protein expression (-46%; P<0.05) by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Linalool suppressed the gene expression of HMG-CoA reductase by reducing the binding of SREBP-2 to its promoter, as assessed by qPCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation, and by inducing ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of the HMG-CoA reductase. These findings suggest that food molecules with a pleasant scent could exert beneficial metabolic effects through multiple mechanisms.
The aims of our study were to determine if polymorphisms in the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) gene is associated with acute pancreatitis (AP) and to evaluate if inflammation risk is associated with specific COX-2 gene haplotypes containing these polymorphisms.
The COX-2 genotypes for 7 polymorphisms (rs5275, rs2206593, rs4648262, rs4648261, rs2066826, rs5277, rs2745557) were determined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 103 patients with AP and 92 healthy controls.
Except for rs5275, the frequencies of COX-2 polymorphisms were both similar in patients with mild or severe pancreatitis, so were in pancreatitis patients and in controls. Only rs5275 was statistically significantly associated with AP risk. The association was seen with rs5275 (P = 0.03); specifically, patients carrying the TT genotype in comparison with patients carrying the CC genotype had a significantly lower risk of disease (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-3.34). Haplotypes with nucleotide T at the -18491961 position (rs5275) and A at the 184915627 position (rs4648261) of COX-2 promoter seem to increase susceptibility (odds ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-5.29; P = 0.02).
These findings suggest that the rs5275 polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of the COX-2 gene may be used as 1 marker for defining the risk of AP.
Cardiac function was assessed in long-term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to Rosen's T5 or T10 protocol, both including doxorubicin. Thirty-one patients, age 10-45 years (median age 17.8 years) were evaluated 2.3-14.1 years (median 8.9 years) following completion of treatment. Cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225-550 mg/m2 (median dose 360). The evaluation consisted of a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), signal averaged ECG, 24-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and radionuclide angiography. Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed cardiac toxicity, defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular dilation, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction. The incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow-up (P< or = .05). No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability. When adjusted to body surface area, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW index) was decreased in all patients. The incidence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose. Life-long cardiac follow-up in these patients is warranted. The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity.
We report twin neonates who were born prematurely at 32 weeks of gestation to a mother with human immunodeficiency virus infection. One of the twins developed complete heart block and dilated cardiomyopathy related to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, a boosted protease-inhibitor agent, while the other twin developed mild bradycardia. We recommend caution in the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in the immediate neonatal period.
Rofecoxib and celecoxib were the first cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors to be marketed as effective anti inflammatory agents. The results of several recent trials and a meta analysis of currently available studies all demonstrate a greater incidence of increased blood pressure, edema, and cardiovascular events in subjects treated with rofecoxib compared with celecoxib. As an approach to the assessment of molecular mechanisms that may contribute to these cardiorenal differences, this study investigated the inhibitory effects of celecoxib on renal carbonic anhydrase enzyme activity in human hypertensive subjects because in vitro enzyme studies demonstrate such an effect. Ten subjects with stable, treated hypertension were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment sequences, which included, in differing order, 200 mg celecoxib twice a day, 250 mg acetazolamide twice a day, or placebo twice a day. Whereas acetazolamide caused a bicarbonate diuresis and a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, celecoxib appeared to have no detectable effect on renal carbonic anhydrase or acid-base homeostasis. Thus, in this short-term study of human subjects, therapeutic doses of celecoxib did not appear to have a clinically significant inhibitory action on renal carbonic anhydrase.
Animal models suggest that N-acetylcysteine inhibits cocaine-seeking. The present pilot study evaluated whether N-acetylcysteine would suppress reactivity to cocaine-related cues in cocaine-dependent humans.
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 15 participants received N-acetylcysteine or placebo during a 3-day hospitalization. Participants were crossed over to receive the opposite condition on a second, identical 3-day stay occurring 4 days later. During each hospital stay, participants completed a cue-reactivity procedure that involved collecting psychophysical and subjective data in response to slides depicting cocaine and cocaine use.
While taking N-acetylcysteine, participants reported less desire to use and less interest in response to cocaine slides and watched cocaine slides for less time.
The inhibition of cocaine cue reactivity is consistent with existing preclinical data and supports the use of N-acetylcysteine as a treatment for cocaine dependence.
Protein interacting with C-kinase-1 (PICK1) plays a role in the targeting and clustering of dopamine transporter, which is the primary target site for the abused drug methamphetamine. Based on the interaction of PICK1 with dopamine transporter, it is of particular interest to investigate the association between the PICK1 gene and methamphetamine abusers.
The authors studied the association between PICK1 gene polymorphisms and methamphetamine abusers in a Japanese group. Two hundred and eight methamphetamine abusers and 218 healthy comparison subjects were enrolled in the study. Furthermore, the authors also examined the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and 5'-untranslated region on transcription levels of PICK1.
The authors identified four highly frequent SNPs, rs737622 (-332 C/G) and rs3026682 (-205 G/A) in the promoter region and rs713729 (T/A) in intron3 and rs2076369 (T/G) in intron4. Of these SNPs, rs713729 was significantly associated with methamphetamine abusers in general, and rs713729 and rs2076369 were significantly associated with those with spontaneous relapse of psychosis. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that specific haplotypes of these SNPs were associated with methamphetamine abusers. A gene reporter assay revealed that the two SNPs in the promoter region significantly altered transcriptional activity.
Our findings suggest that the PICK1 gene may be implicated in the susceptibility to spontaneous relapse of methamphetamine psychosis and that, as an intracellular adapter protein, PICK1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of methamphetamine psychosis.
