Zolpidem is a new, short-acting hypnotic of imidazopyridine structure which binds selectively to a subpopulation of receptors involved in the action of benzodiazepines [omega 1 (BZ1) sites of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors]. The present study investigated whether tolerance and physical dependence develop after repeated treatment with zolpidem as is observed with benzodiazepines. Mice were given zolpidem or the benzodiazepine midazolam (2 x 30 mg/kg, p.o.) for 10 consecutive days. Tolerance to central depressant effects (evaluated by recording spontaneous locomotor activity) and to anticonvulsant effects (measured against pentylenetetrazole-, electroshock- and isoniazid-induced convulsions) was assessed 42 hr after the last administration. A decrease in the latency to isoniazid-induced convulsions was taken as an index of physical dependence and was evaluated 3, 6, 14, 24, 42 and 67 hr after the end of chronic drug treatment. Repeated treatment with midazolam produced tolerance to its sedative and anticonvulsant activities as indicated by shifts of the dose-response curves by a factor of 3 to 5. Fourteen hr after discontinuation of treatment, spontaneous withdrawal was observed and lasted 3 days. When flumazenil was given 3 or 6 hr after the final midazolam injection, precipitated withdrawal was observed. In contrast, after repeated treatment with zolpidem, there was no change in its ability to produce sedative and anticonvulsant effects. Moreover, neither spontaneous nor flumazenil-induced precipitated withdrawal was observed in zolpidem-treated mice.
A 34-year-old mother developed acute myocardial infarction (MI) 10 days postpartum while taking bromocriptine for ablactation. Her only known risk factor was moderate hypercholesterolemia. The initial coronary arteriogram revealed minimal irregularities of the mid- and distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, but severe narrowing of a large first diagonal branch of the LAD. Repeat coronary arteriography, performed two months later for recurrent chest pain, showed no significant change in the LAD. There was, however, a marked improvement in the first diagonal branch. To the authors' knowledge this is the 10th report of MI in a patient using bromocriptine postpartum for milk suppression and only the second one to implicate by its investigations the role of vasospasm in the coronary vessels at the cause of the infarction.
The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate gall-bladder form and contents, (ii) to assess the prevalence of gallstones in acromegalic patients before octreotide treatment and the incidence of gallstone formation in patients with acromegaly during long-term (6-90 months, mean 44 months) octreotide treatment, and (iii) to test the efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid in preventing and treating octreotide-induced cholelithiasis.
Forty-nine patients (23 men and 26 women, aged 19-81 years) were studied by repeated gall-bladder ultrasonography performed at baseline and then every 6 months during octreotide therapy. All ultrasound scans were evaluated by the same radiologist. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-squared and regression analysis tests.
Asymptomatic stones were recorded in 13/49 patients (26.5%) prior to octreotide treatment (the prevalence of cholelithiasis in the Italian population is 9.5% in men and 18.9% in women). During octreotide therapy gallstones developed in 10/36 patients (27.7%). No significant correlations with sex, age, body mass index, duration of the disease, daily dose and duration of octreotide therapy, altered gall-bladder form, family history of gallbladder stones, basal plasma values of cholesterol and triglycerides were found between the patients (10/36) who developed stones during octreotide treatment and the ones who did not (26/36). Fourteen patients (10 with newly developed stones and four with cholelithiasis diagnosed prior to octreotide) were put on ursodeoxycholic acid at the daily dose of 10 mg/kg. Gallstones completely disappeared in 6/14 patients (42.8%; five patients with newly developed stones and one with stones prior to octreotide therapy) after a mean of 30.8 months of ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. In addition, seven patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid at the preventive dose of 450 mg, administered as a once-a-day oral preparation in the evening. However, stones developed in one of these seven patients who was thereafter cured (gallstones completely disappeared) by the therapeutic dose of ursodeoxycholic acid of 10 mg/kg/day after 23 months of treatment.
This study indicates that (i) acromegaly by itself is correlated with a high prevalence of gallbladder stones, (ii) the long-term treatment with octreotide increases the incidence of cholelithiasis, and (iii) ursodeoxycholic acid is useful in the treatment of gallstones in acromegalic patients but its prophylactic effect in patients on octreotide treatment requires further assessment.
Vasorelaxant responses to the potassium channel opening drug, pinacidil, were obtained on preparations of pulmonary artery and aorta taken from rats with pulmonary hypertension (induced by chronic hypoxia or monocrotaline) and pre-contracted either submaximally with endothelin-1 (ET-1), PGF2 alpha, U46619 (thromboxane-mimetic) or noradrenaline (NA), or with 80 mM K+. In pulmonary artery, but not aorta, from pulmonary hypertensive rats the maximum relaxant response to pinacidil was increased, when compared with data in control rats, irrespective of the spasmogen used to precontract the tissues. The increase in maximum was associated with relaxation to below the tissue resting baseline and probably reflected the presence of inherent contractile tone in arteries from pulmonary hypertensive rats. In addition the potency (-log EC50) of pinacidil was increased in pulmonary arteries from pulmonary hypertensive rats but this was seen only in preparations contracted with ET-1 (30-fold increase) or NA (seven-fold increase) and not in those contracted with PGF2 alpha, U46619 or K+. As a result, in ET-1 contracted preparations from pulmonary hypertensive rats pinacidil was 29-fold more potent on pulmonary artery than on aorta. To explain the increase in potency it is speculated that during the development of pulmonary hypertension the mechanism whereby ET-1 and NA contract pulmonary arteries may change from one in which Ca2+ influx plays only a minor role to one in which Ca2+ influx predominates, although no direct evidence to support this speculation has yet been obtained.
A recent in-vitro study demonstrated that the potent disulfide reducing agent, DL-dithiothreitol (DTT), may alter the structural stability of the GABA(B) receptor, probably inactivating the disulfide bonds between four cysteine residues located in the GABA(B1(a)) receptor structure.
The present study was designed to evaluate whether DTT treatment was capable of antagonizing some behavioral effects of pharmacological stimulation of the GABA(B) receptor.
Experiments on sedation/hypnosis induced by the GABA(B) receptor agonists baclofen, SKF 97541, CGP 44532 and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) in DBA mice and selectively bred GHB-sensitive (GHB-S) rats, and a GHB drug discrimination study in Long Evans rats were conducted. Specificity of the DTT action on the GABA(B) receptor was investigated by assessing its effect on the sedative/hypnotic effect induced by diazepam, ketamine and ethanol.
DTT prevented the sedative/hypnotic effect of all GABA(B) receptor agonists tested and also reversed baclofen-induced sedation/hypnosis. In contrast, DTT had no effect on, or even potentiated, sedation/hypnosis produced by diazepam, ketamine or ethanol. DTT completely blocked the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB.
These results are discussed in terms of DTT altering the stability of the binding domain of the GABA(B) receptor, hindering the drug-receptor interaction.
The extract from the root of Angelica acutiloba Kitagawa (AR), which is used as herbal medicine in Japan, has been reported to be clinically effective for postmenstrual blood loss and erythropoietin (EPO)-resistant anemia in chronic renal failure, although the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its clinical efficacy are unknown. We prepared an animal model of anemia by bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) at 150 mg/kg to mice (8- to 12-week-old female C57BL/6J), and then administered orally the water-soluble fraction of AR to the anemic mice for 10 days. After confirming the anti-anemic effect of the water-soluble fraction of AR (AR-3) containing polysaccharides, we examined the effects of AR-3 on immature erythroid cell activity, EPO production, and plasma cytokine levels. AR-3 administration at 50 mg/kg activated erythroid progenitor cells in bone marrow on day 10, increased the percentage of peripheral reticulocytes in red blood cells on day 15, and led to the recovery of red blood cell count to a value that was almost equal to the basal level on day 20. Although EPO production, which was determined by examining EPO mRNA expression in kidney and liver, remained unaltered by AR-3 administration, this treatment significantly lowered plasma interferon-gamma level, which may suppress the activity of erythroid progenitor cells. These results suggest that the polysaccharides in AR promote hematopoiesis by activating immature erythroid cells, in part, by suppressing cytokine secretion. Since the hematopoietic effect was achieved by high-dose AR-3, identification of specific polysaccharides is still required for the development of a novel medicine for anemia caused by a malignancy or chemotherapy.
This open, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lamivudine prophylaxis given to chronic hepatitis B virus-(HBV) infected patients before and after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We now present long-term data that follow our previous short-term report.
Twenty-three patients were treated with lamivudine (100 mg orally, daily); 13 (57%), were serum HBV DNA positive (Abbott Genostics, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) at study entry. Patients received lamivudine for at least 4 weeks before OLT, and for up to 50 months (median 25 months) after OLT.
Of the 23 treated patients, 17 survived to undergo OLT. Eleven patients (65%) survived up to 4 years (median 36 months) after OLT. One of the survivors stopped lamivudine because of a possible adverse reaction 9 months post-OLT, and prophylaxis with HBV immune globulin was then established. Ten survivors continue lamivudine. Eight long-term survivors have normal liver function without evidence of HBV reinfection. Of the 17 transplanted patients, 6 died. Four patients died (3 days to 5 months post-OLT) without evidence of graft reinfection. Two further patients died at 19 and 23 months post-OLT from graft failure. Both patients had YMDD variant detected at 12 months post-OLT. Two other patients with YMDD-variant HBV remain alive on lamivudine, 9 and 15 months after development of the variant.
Lamivudine, given before and after OLT, prevents significant graft reinfection for the majority of treated patients. The study has also shown that lamivudine is extremely well tolerated by liver failure patients and for a prolonged period after transplantation.
Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome of impaired insulin secretion/sensitivity and frequently diagnosed by hyperglycemia, lipid abnormalities, and vascular complications. The diabetic 'glucolipotoxicity' also induces immunodepression in patients by redox impairment of immune cells. Astaxanthin (ASTA) is a pinkish-orange carotenoid found in many marine foods (e.g. shrimp, crabs, salmon), which has powerful antioxidant, photoprotective, antitumor, and cardioprotective properties. Aiming for an antioxidant therapy against diabetic immunodepression, we here tested the ability of prophylactic ASTA supplementation (30 days, 20 mg ASTA/kg BW) to oppose the redox impairment observed in isolated lymphocytes from alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats. The redox status of lymphocytes were thoroughly screened by measuring: (i) production of superoxide (O(2)(-)), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)); (ii) cytosolic Ca(2+); (iii) indexes of oxidative injury; and (iv) activities of major antioxidant enzymes. Hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects of ASTA in plasma of ASTA-fed/diabetic rats were apparently reflected in the circulating lymphocytes, since lower activities of catalase, restored ratio between glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities and lower scores of lipid oxidation were concomitantly measured in those immune cells. Noteworthy, lower production of NO and O(2)(-) (precursors of peroxynitrite), and lower cytosolic Ca(2+) indicate a hypothetical antiapoptotic effect of ASTA in diabetic lymphocytes. However, questions are still open regarding the proper ASTA supplementation dose needed to balance efficient antioxidant protection and essential NO/H(2)O(2)-mediated proliferative capacities of diabetic lymphocytes.
We describe the case of a 40 year old woman, who had suffered from asthma since infancy, with a negative case history of asthma induced by aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) agents, who died after ingesting 400 mg of ibuprofen. The autopsy specimens collected 3 months after death had all the characteristic pathological features of fatal asthma. The medical records showed that the patient was not informed of the potential fatal outcome of an asthma attack, and that she was not properly treated.
A teenage girl in bone marrow remission with acute lymphocytic leukemia died suddenly from pulmonary edema. She had taken her first oral dose of methotrexate and cyclophosphamide 10 hours previously when she was feeling well and was asymptomatic. One week previously she had received the last of four intrathecal injections of methotrexate. Autopsy showed marked pulmonary edema as well as chronic lung changes, as previously described in patients with methotrexate pneumonitis. There is usually at least a 12-day interval from the onset of administration of methotrexate to the onset of the lung toxicity. The authors suggest the patient was sensitized by the intrathecal methotrexate and then reacted with angioneurotic edema of the lung when given the first oral dose of methotrexate. Careful examination for infectious agents, including electron microscopy, was negative.
Two women, aged 77 and 73 years, and one man, aged 71 years, were admitted because of a serious adverse drug reaction (ADR). The first woman had a probable adverse drug reaction caused by digoxin after the addition of a NSAID (diclofenac) to a combination of digoxin and other drugs (furosemide and hydroquinine). The ADR due to digoxin is an example of a pharmacokinetic interaction. The second woman had serious orthostatic hypotension because of a pharmacodynamic interaction between three different antihypertensives. In the man, the ADR was hypoglycaemia while taking glibenclamide, a second generation sulfonylurea derivative. This was probably caused by declining renal function of a transplanted kidney because of bladder cancer. Doctors should be aware of ADRs in older patients, which also can occur when no changes in medication have taken place. In old age, any decline in vitality or function can be due to an ADR.
Regenerating gene family, member 4 (Reg IV), a secreted protein, is overexpressed in several cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). In the present study, we measured Reg IV levels in sera from patients with GC by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also examined the effect of forced Reg IV expression on the apoptotic susceptibility to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Forced expression of Reg IV inhibited 5-FU-induced apoptosis. Induction of Bcl-2 and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase was involved in inhibition of apoptosis. Among 36 GC patients treated with a combination chemotherapy of low-dose 5-FU and cisplatin, all 14 Reg IV-positive patients showed no change or disease progression. The serum Reg IV concentration was similar between healthy individuals (mean+/-s.e., 0.52+/-0.05 ng/ml) and patients with chronic-active gastritis (0.36+/-0.09 ng/ml). However, the serum Reg IV concentration in presurgical GC patients was significantly elevated (1.96+/-0.17 ng/ml), even at stage I. The diagnostic sensitivity of serum Reg IV (36.1%) was superior to that of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (11.5%) or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (13.1%). These results indicate that expression of Reg IV is a marker for prediction of resistance to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in patients with GC. Serum Reg IV represents a novel biomarker for GC.
To observe the effects of ZMS on learning and memory ability and on brain choline acetyltransferase activity.
A single intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine was used to establish a dementia mouse model. The learning and memory ability was detected by step-through and sted-down tests. And the choline acetyltransferase activity in brain was determined by 3H-acetyl-CoA incorporation analysis.
ZMS could significantly reduce wrongness frequences, prolong incubation period of scopolamine-induced dementia mice in step-through and step-down tests (P < 0.01). ZMS could also significantly improve the activity of brain choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (P < 0.01).
ZMS could improve the learning and memory ability and the activity of brain ChAT in scopolamine-induced dementia mice. However, ZMS had no significant dose-response effect on improving the activity of brain ChAT, and the effect of Tacrine was similar to that of ZMS, it seemed unlikely that ZMS had a direct action on the ChAT. More probably, ZMS exerted its effect on ChAT activity and on learning and memory ability via elevating brain M receptor density.
Two regimens for infusing vancomycin over 1 h (500 mg every 6 h for five doses or 100 mg every 12 h for three doses) were used in 11 volunteers. Subjects received both regimens one week apart; the regimen used first for each subject was randomized. Nine receiving the 1000-mg dose experienced the "red-man (neck)" syndrome; none had the reaction while receiving the 500-mg dose (P = .002). Plasma histamine concentration, measured every 10 min during the first infusion of each regimen, increased in most subjects given 1000-mg doses; there was only a slight change in histamine levels after 500-mg doses. There was a significant relation between histamine release and reaction severity; frequency and severity of the reaction declined with subsequent doses. We conclude that the red-man syndrome occurs frequently in normal adults who receive 1000 mg of vancomycin over 1 h, that vancomycin causes an infusion rate-dependent increase in plasma histamine concentration, and that the increase in plasma histamine concentration is correlated with the severity of the reaction.
Environmental xenobiotics such as organophosphate pesticides are known factors involved in male infertility. Paraoxanase (PON) and glutathione transferase (GST) are involved in biotransformation of organophosphate pesticides. Interindividual genetic variations in biotransformation enzyme activities can lead to differences in the susceptibility to male infertility. This case-control study investigated associations between polymorphisms in the PON and GST genes (PON1-55/192, PON2-311, GSTM1/T1) and infertility. The study group consisted of 187 infertile men (86 with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and 101 with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT)), whereas the control group comprised of 194 fertile men. Statistically significant differences were found in PON1-55MM genotype (chi-squared=7.37; P=0.02) and PON1-55M allele (chi-squared=5.98; P=0.01) distribution between the infertile and fertile men. A separate analysis revealed that significant differences in genotype frequencies were limited to the OAT group (chi-squared=9.11, P=0.01). However, no significant differences in genotype frequencies of other tested polymorphisms (PON1-192, PON2-311, GSTM1/T1) and male infertility were observed. The PON1-55M allele might represent a risk factor for infertility susceptibility in Slovenian men. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.
Previously published reports indicate that serum copper levels are elevated in patients with prostate cancer and that increased copper uptake can be used as a means to image prostate tumors. It is unclear, however, to what extent copper is required for prostate cancer cell function as we observed only modest effects of chelation strategies on the growth of these cells in vitro. With the goal of exploiting prostate cancer cell proclivity for copper uptake, we developed a "conditional lethal" screen to identify compounds whose cytotoxic actions were manifested in a copper-dependent manner. Emerging from this screen was a series of dithiocarbamates, which, when complexed with copper, induced reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis of malignant, but not normal, prostate cells. One of the dithiocarbamates identified, disulfiram (DSF), is an FDA-approved drug that has previously yielded disappointing results in clinical trials in patients with recurrent prostate cancer. Similarly, in our studies, DSF alone had a minimal effect on the growth of prostate cancer tumors when propagated as xenografts. However, when DSF was coadministered with copper, a very dramatic inhibition of tumor growth in models of hormone-sensitive and of castrate-resistant disease was observed. Furthermore, we determined that prostate cancer cells express high levels of CTR1, the primary copper transporter, and additional chaperones that are required to maintain intracellular copper homeostasis. The expression levels of most of these proteins are increased further upon treatment of androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cell lines with androgens. Not surprisingly, robust CTR1-dependent uptake of copper into prostate cancer cells was observed, an activity that was accentuated by activation of AR. Given these data linking AR to intracellular copper uptake, we believe that dithiocarbamate/copper complexes are likely to be effective for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer whose disease is resistant to classical androgen ablation therapies.
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients vary widely in their response to levodopa treatment, and this variation may be partially genetic in origin. We determined whether particular dopamine and opioid receptor polymorphisms were associated with risk of earlier onset of dyskinesia side effects during levodopa therapy. Smoking status was also examined. The 92 subjects were recruited from the movement disorders clinic of a neurology practice associated with a medical school. All were adult-onset PD patients who had been taking levodopa at least 5 years and/or had developed levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Carrying the G-allele of the A118G single nucleotide coding region polymorphism of the mu opioid receptor, as well as a history of never smoking, were independently associated with increased risk of earlier onset of dyskinesia (P=0.05 and 0.02, respectively). One genotype of the D2 dopamine receptor intronic dinucleotide repeat polymorphism (14 repeats/15 repeats, with frequency of 6%) was also associated with earlier dyskinesia (P=0.003). History of smoking has previously been associated with reduced risk of developing PD. Our results suggest that smoking history may also influence the response to levodopa, with contribution comparable to those of individual genes including the mu opioid receptor and D2 dopamine receptor.
To distinguish between catecholaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms for baroreflex regulation in the medulla, we compared rats with chemical lesions produced by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) bilaterally at the caudal tip of the area postrema. After 2 weeks, basal blood pressure and heart rate were unaltered, but blood pressure lability, instead of being increased, was slightly reduced. Baroreflex tests in conscious rats showed that although phenylephrine-induced reflex bradycardia was unaffected, nitroprusside-induced reflex tachycardia was enhanced by 5,7-DHT. In anesthetized rats, drug-induced reflex chronotropic responses no longer differed between groups, but attendant decreases or increases in renal nerve activity were consistently reduced by 6-OHDA. On the other hand, upon afferent aortic nerve stimulation, particularly with low current frequencies, bradycardic and sympathoinhibitory responses were enhanced by 5,7-DHT, but the sympathoinhibitory responses were reduced by 6-OHDA. Despite the absence of demonstrable necrosis or cell loss at NTS injection sites, 6-OHDA reduced norepinephrine mainly and serotonin partly, whereas 5-7-DHT reduced serotonin content alone, thereby indicating that chemical lesions had indeed been produced. Because these cardiovascular changes probably reflect differences in catecholaminergic vs. serotonergic baroreflex regulation, our results are generally compatible with the interpretation that baroreflex modulation in the NTS involves catecholaminergic facilitation and serotonergic inhibition.
A number of centrally active drugs were tested for antagonism of physostigmine- or apomorphine-induced yawning and for apomorphine-induced penile erections. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists piperoxan and idazoxan inhibited the yawning response without affecting the penile erections. The 5HT agonist quipazine and the histamine antagonist dexchlorpheniramine inhibited the yawning response more effectively than the penile erections. Dexchlorpheniramine even enhanced the apomorphine-induced penile erections and induced penile erections in physostigmine-treated rats. The 5HT antagonists metergoline and methysergide blocked the apomorphine-induced penile erections without affecting the yawning response. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, the dopamine antagonist sulpiride, the antihistaminic mepyramine and the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide inhibited both yawning and penile erections at the same dose level. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and phenoxybenzamine were inactive. It is concluded that yawning and penile erections can be differentially affected by drug treatments. Also, while concomitant yawning and penile erections can be selectively induced by a class of dopamine receptor agonists, the same selectivity does not apply to antagonism of these induced behaviours.
Lead has negative effect on cognitive functions in children. However, individuals differ in susceptibility. One possible explanation is a genetic predisposition. Polymorphisms in the δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes may modify lead metabolism and neurotoxicity, but information regarding the central nervous system is very limited. The aim of the study was to determine whether ALAD and VDR polymorphisms modify blood lead (B-Pb), and the association between B-Pb and cognitive function (IQ) in children. In 2007-2010 a cohort of 175 children (age 6-10years, mean 7.8) was recruited in Southern Poland, tested for IQ (Wechsler intelligence scale) and analyzed for B-Pb (range 9.0-221; mean 46.6μg/L), ALAD (RsaI, MspI) and VDR (FokI, BsmI, TaqI) polymorphisms. ALAD or VDR genotypes were not associated with B-Pb. B-Pb was non-significantly negatively associated with full scale IQ (r(S)=-0.11; P=0.14), and significantly with performance subscale results (r(S)=-0.19; P=0.01). The ALAD RsaI polymorphism modified the relationship between full scale IQ and B-Pb: RsaI T carriers had a steeper slope compared to CC homozygote carriers (β coefficient -0.06 vs 0.32, respectively, P for interaction <0.001, adjusted for the child's age, mother's education and family income). This means that with increasing B-Pb with 1μg/L, T carriers demonstrate 0.06 score lower IQ. For the VDR BsmI, B carriers had a steeper slope than the bb homozygotes carriers (β coefficient -0.08 vs 0.16, respectively, P for interaction=0.001), and similar effect was found for TaqI t carriers vs TT homozygotes (P for interaction=0.02). For ALAD MspI and VDR FokI there was no significant modification. The ALAD RsaI, VDR BsmI and TaqI polymorphisms modified the relationship between IQ and B-Pb. Hence, there is a fraction of the population, which is particularly sensitive to lead neurotoxicity.
Measurements of myocardial contrast (sonicated meglumine diatrizoate) intensity were compared with myocardial flow by radioactive microspheres before and after administration of dipyridamole (0.5 mg/kg body weight intravenously) in 10 open chest dogs with a critical stenosis in the left circumflex coronary artery. Computer measurements of contrast time-intensity curves corrected for background myocardial intensity were made along 12 transmural segments of the left ventricle at mid-papillary level and for the subendocardial and subepicardial half of each segment. After administration of dipyridamole, transmural flow in the control region increased significantly (p less than 0.001), resulting in a dipyridamole/baseline flow ratio (i.e., coronary reserve ratio) of 2.54 +/- 0.95. Similar changes (p less than 0.001) were seen by contrast echocardiography; the coronary reserve ratio was 2.10 +/- 0.60 with use of peak intensity and 3.48 +/- 1.58 with use of area under the time-intensity curve. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in myocardial flow, peak contrast intensity or area under the curve in the ischemic region after dipyridamole. In the control region the ratio of subendocardial to subepicardial flow was similar at baseline and after dipyridamole administration as assessed by microspheres (1.08 +/- 0.24 versus 1.17 +/- 0.25) or by area under the time-intensity curve (1.11 +/- 0.45 versus 1.11 +/- 0.56). In the ischemic region, the subendocardial/subepicardial flow ratio decreased significantly after dipyridamole administration as measured by microspheres (1.15 +/- 0.19 to 0.82 +/- 0.25; p less than 0.001) or by area under the curve (1.10 +/- 0.28 to 0.70 +/- 0.47; p less than 0.01). Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography appears to be a sensitive technique with which to detect changes in myocardial flow induced by dipyridamole in the various myocardial layers of normal segments as well as of segments supplied by a critically stenotic coronary artery.
