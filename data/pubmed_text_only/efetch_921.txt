Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity initiates a number of intracellular signaling cascades that result in leukemogenesis. Imatinib mesylate, a specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been highly successful in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, the emergence of imatinib resistance and the incomplete molecular response of a significant number of patients receiving this therapy have led to a search for combinations of drugs that will enhance the efficacy of imatinib. We have demonstrated that mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor that results in depletion of intracellular guanine nucleotides, is synergistic with imatinib in inducing apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines. Studies of signaling pathways downstream of Bcr-Abl demonstrated that the addition of MPA to imatinib reduced the phosphorylation of both Stat5 and Lyn, a Src kinase family member. The phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein was also greatly reduced. These results demonstrate that inhibitors of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis may synergize with imatinib in reducing the levels of minimal residual disease in CML and lay the foundation for clinical trials in which IMPDH inhibitors are added to imatinib in patients who have suboptimal molecular responses to single agent therapy or who have progressive disease.
Most tumor cells are sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis but sparing to normal cells, thus providing therapeutic potential for clinical use. Some tumor cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death while the sensitivity could be recruited with the existence of some chemical agents. In this study, human prostatic cancer cell line LNCaP was found to be resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis while it could be restored to TRAIL sensitivity with combination treatment of low concentration of doxorubicin. TRAIL receptor-1 (DR4) and TRAIL receptor-2 (DR5) were upregulated under the treatment of doxorubicin and verified to be responsible for TRAIL-mediated signal transduction. Furthermore, caspase-8 and caspase-3 were activated and drove their autocleavage into programmed cell death. Interestingly, apoptosis-inhibitory protein c-FLIP, but not Bcl-2 and XIAP was downregulated after doxorubicin treatment. Taken together, these findings suggested that the pathway of cell apoptosis induced by TRAIL was intact but under negative control. Subtoxic concentration of doxorubicin effectively boosted TRAIL sensitivity via depletion of antiapoptotic protein. These findings support the new strategies for killing tumors with TRAIL and chemical agents.
Evidence from both hypertensive and normotensive individuals indicate that elevated blood pressure is associated with decreased pain sensitivity. The current study sought to experimentally raise blood pressure using 250 mg caffeine, and investigate its effects on the cold pressor pain experiences of 25 men and 25 women. In a placebo-controlled repeated-measures experiment, caffeine increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as producing more clearheaded and energetic feelings. Caffeine produced higher pain threshold and pain tolerance levels compared to placebo, and women had a lower tolerance to pain than men. Finally, a significant association was found between caffeine-related increase in systolic blood pressure and caffeine-related increase in pain tolerance. Furthermore, this association was the strongest in women. These results are discussed in light of future directions for pain and hypertension research.
We describe an outbreak of deaths from cocaine-induced excited delirium (EDDs) in Dade County, Florida between 1979 and 1990. From a registry of all cocaine-related deaths in Dade County, Florida, from 1969-1990, 58 EDDs were compared with 125 victims of accidental cocaine overdose without excited delirium. Compared with controls, EDDs were more frequently black, male, and younger. They were less likely to have a low body mass index, and more likely to have died in police custody, to have received medical treatment immediately before death, to have survived for a longer period, to have developed hyperthermia, and to have died in summer months. EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls. The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic cocaine use disrupts dopaminergic function and, when coupled with recent cocaine use, may precipitate agitation, delirium, aberrant thermoregulation, rhabdomyolysis, and sudden death.
Ventricular tachyarrhythmia induction was facilitated during infusion of isoproterenol in 21 of 60 patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in whom programmed electrical stimulation alone failed to reproducibly induce sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Of 44 patients with no ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced before isoproterenol infusion, 11 had a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia and 1 patient had unsustained VT induced by isoproterenol alone or by programmed stimulation during the infusion. In 9 of 16 patients in whom nonreproducible or unsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced before isoproterenol infusion, more reproducible or more sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced during the infusion. Tachyarrhythmia induction was facilitated by isoproterenol in 20 of 40 patients with sustained VT clinically, but in only 1 of 20 patients with unsustained VT or VF clinically. Among patients with sustained VT clinically, those with exercise-provoked VT and those who had not been tested with stimulation at a second right ventricular site or in the left ventricle were more likely to have induction facilitated by isoproterenol. Drugs effective against induction of isoproterenol-facilitated ventricular tachyarrhythmias were identified in 13 of 25 trials. These drugs were effective during a mean follow-up of 17 months in 7 of 9 long-term trials.
Ischemia/reperfusion injury may have deleterious short- and long-term consequences for cardiac allografts. The underlying mechanisms involve microvascular dysfunction that may culminate in primary graft failure or untreatable chronic rejection.
Here, we report that rat cardiac allograft ischemia/reperfusion injury resulted in profound microvascular dysfunction that was prevented by donor treatment with peroral single-dose simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and Rho GTPase inhibitor, 2 hours before graft procurement. During allograft preservation, donor simvastatin treatment inhibited microvascular endothelial cell and pericyte RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase activation and endothelial cell-endothelial cell gap formation; decreased intragraft mRNA levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and endothelin-1; and increased heme oxygenase-1. Donor, but not recipient, simvastatin treatment prevented ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced vascular leakage, leukocyte infiltration, the no-reflow phenomenon, and myocardial injury. The beneficial effects of simvastatin on vascular stability and the no-reflow phenomenon were abolished by concomitant nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and RhoA activation by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate supplementation, respectively. In the chronic rejection model, donor simvastatin treatment inhibited cardiac allograft inflammation, transforming growth factor-β1 signaling, and myocardial fibrosis. In vitro, simvastatin inhibited transforming growth factor-β1-induced microvascular endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
Our results demonstrate that donor simvastatin treatment prevents microvascular endothelial cell and pericyte dysfunction, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and chronic rejection and suggest a novel, clinically feasible strategy to protect cardiac allografts.
The influence of pregnancy and lactation on morphine-induced hypothermia and hyperactivity was investigated in Rockland-Swiss mice. Pregnant mice were slower to recover from the hypothermic effect of morphine than nonpregnant controls. The greatest hypothermic response was seen in mice at day 18, the day before parturition. On the day after parturition, mice recovered faster from morphine-induced hypothermia than controls. During lactation, mice were again slower to recover from the morphine-induced hypothermia. Morphine-induced locomotor activity, however, was attenuated by both pregnancy and lactation. A further experiment compared the hypothermic effect of morphine in postpartum mice that were allowed to remain with pups and mice that were separated from pups. The enhanced hypothermia in the postpartum period was abolished by removing pups. This indicates that the altered response to morphine in the postpartum period was an effect of lactation rather than an aftereffect of pregnancy or parturition.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is extensively used in the long-term treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although considered by clinicians to be relatively safe, serious side effects have been documented in the literature. Retinotoxicity has received the most attention, whereas neuromyotoxicity and cardiotoxicity have been described in isolated case reports. We present 2 cases of potential cardiotoxicity occurring in patients with SLE while receiving long-term HCQ therapy.
To review the incidence, presentation, and mechanism of serious antimalarial toxicity, and to discuss the impact of HCQ on cardiac health in SLE.
The authors reviewed the English-language literature from 1948 to December 2002 using Medline databases.
In addition to our patients, there are 2 published cases of biopsy-proven HCQ cardiotoxicity in the English-language literature. Both occurred in patients with SLE. The literature indicates that antimalarial cardiotoxicity may be of particular importance in patients with SLE given their already increased cardiac risk due to primary heart disease and accelerated atherosclerosis. Endomyocardial biopsy reveals a constellation of findings including vacuolar myopathy, myeloid bodies, and curvilinear bodies.
As HCQ use among SLE patients increases, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of antimalarial cardiotoxicity. The potential severity and reversibility of this complication underscore the importance of timely diagnosis. The cases presented here, one with biopsy and one without, illustrate the utility of endomyocardial biopsy in HCQ-treated SLE patients with cardiac complaints to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
Hyperhomocysteinemia is a condition caused by both genetic and nongenetic factors. To determine whether a common methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) variant is related to elevated homocysteine concentrations in epileptic patients receiving anticonvulsants, we investigated the plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) level, folate level, and MTHFR 677 C --> T mutation using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with HinfI digestion in 103 patients with epilepsy and 103 normal controls. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (> or = 11.4 micromol/L, 90th percentile of control group) was higher in patients than in controls (25% v 10.0%, P = .007). The homozygosity for the 677 C --> T mutation of MTHFR was associated with elevated tHcy and low folate levels. The magnitude of hyperhomocysteinemia in MTHFR TT homozygotes was more pronounced in epileptic patients than in controls (18.2 +/- 1.6 v 9.1 +/- 1.2 micromol/L, P = .04). In epileptic patients, hyperhomocysteinemia was more frequent in MTHFR TT genotypes versus CT or CC genotypes (58% v 17% and 16%, P < .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that MTHFR TT genotype was an independent predictor of hyperhomocysteinemia in epileptic patients receiving anticonvulsants (phenytoin and carbamazepine but not valproic acid), suggesting that gene-drug interactions induce hyperhomocysteinemia. These findings indicate that epileptic patients receiving anticonvulsants may have a higher folate requirement to maintain a normal tHcy level, especially homozygotes for MTHFR 677 C --> T mutation.
Young male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given drinking water containing 5 or 50 ppm Pb for 40 days prior to mating. Pregnant females were continued on these regimens throughout gestation and lactation. After weaning the offspring were similarly exposed through adulthood. Reflex development, body weights, and locomotor activity were measured in the offspring. Significant delays were noted in the development of the righting reflex at 5 and 50 ppm and in eye opening at 50 ppm. No difference was observed in development of the startle reflex at either dose. Mean body weights of treatment groups during this developmental period were not significantly different from controls. Locomotor activity was measured in adult males utilizing a residential maze. Both levels of lead produced a significant reduction in locomotor activity. When groups were treated with d-amphetamine (4.0 mg/kg subcutaneous), lead treatment caused a dose-related diminution in the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. These results indicate that rats exposed to low levels of lead from conception until adulthood show a delay in nervous system development. As adults, these animals exhibit hypoactivity and decreased responsiveness to amphetamine.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable, heterogeneous disorder of early onset, consisting of a triad of symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The disorder has a significant genetic component, and theories of etiology include abnormalities in the dopaminergic system, with DRD4, DAT1, SNAP25, and DRD5 being implicated as major susceptibility genes. An initial report of association between ADHD and the common 148-bp allele of a microsatellite marker located 18.5 kb from the DRD5 gene has been followed by several studies showing nonsignificant trends toward association with the same allele. To establish the postulated association of the (CA)(n) repeat with ADHD, we collected genotypic information from 14 independent samples of probands and their parents, analyzed them individually and, in the absence of heterogeneity, analyzed them as a joint sample. The joint analysis showed association with the DRD5 locus (P=.00005; odds ratio 1.24; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.38). This association appears to be confined to the predominantly inattentive and combined clinical subtypes.
At 21 weeks of gestation, a 37-year-old woman was referred to our hospital. The fetus showed bradycardia and arrhythmia. Because of glaucoma the woman had previously been treated with timolol eye drops. In this paper a possible association between the timolol eye drops and the fetal cardiac arrhythmia is discussed.
We present a case report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) developing in a kidney/pancreas transplant recipient after the initiation of treatment with clopidogrel for symptomatic coronary artery disease.
A 35-year-old male kidney/pancreas recipient developed unstable angina 5 years after transplantation. The patient was treated with clopidogrel as adjunct therapy. A TTP/HUS condition developed, was diagnosed early, and successfully reversed with the implementation of plasmapheresis and cessation of clopidogrel and cyclosporine A.
The patient continues taking cyclosporine A with good renal function 6 months after the incident, and successfully underwent coronary artery by-pass grafting 3 months after the event.
This case demonstrates that early identification and treatment can reverse the TTP/HUS process associated with thienopyridine-derived agents. We strongly recommend that drugs of the thienopyridine class be used cautiously in transplant recipients, especially those taking calcineurin-inhibitors.
Acetaminophen (APAP) is safe at therapeutic levels but causes hepatotoxicity via N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine-induced oxidative stress upon overdose. To determine the effect of human (h) pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation and CYP3A4 induction on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, mice humanized for PXR and CYP3A4 (TgCYP3A4/hPXR) were treated with APAP and rifampicin. Human PXR activation and CYP3A4 induction enhanced APAP-induced hepatotoxicity as revealed by hepatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities elevated in serum, and hepatic necrosis after coadministration of rifampicin and APAP, compared with APAP administration alone. In contrast, hPXR mice, wild-type mice, and Pxr-null mice exhibited significantly lower ALT/AST levels compared with TgCYP3A4/hPXR mice after APAP administration. Toxicity was coincident with depletion of hepatic glutathione and increased production of hydrogen peroxide, suggesting increased oxidative stress upon hPXR activation. Moreover, mRNA analysis demonstrated that CYP3A4 and other PXR target genes were significantly induced by rifampicin treatment. Urinary metabolomic analysis indicated that cysteine-APAP and its metabolite S-(5-acetylamino-2-hydroxyphenyl)mercaptopyruvic acid were the major contributors to the toxic phenotype. Quantification of plasma APAP metabolites indicated that the APAP dimer formed coincident with increased oxidative stress. In addition, serum metabolomics revealed reduction of lysophosphatidylcholine in the APAP-treated groups. These findings demonstrated that human PXR is involved in regulation of APAP-induced toxicity through CYP3A4-mediated hepatic metabolism of APAP in the presence of PXR ligands.
The similarity between ketamine effects and endogenous psychoses has created interest in the capacity of antipsychotic medications to block ketamine effects. In healthy subjects, a sub-anaesthetic single dose of lorazepam, typical neuroleptics, such as haloperidol, and atypical neuroleptics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, failed to block ketamine-induced positive and negative symptoms resembling schizophrenia. However, haloperidol is able to decrease ketamine-induced impairment in executive cognitive functions. Recently, lamotrigine reduced ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and cognitive impairments. In schizophrenic subjects, single doses of olanzapine do not decrease the effects of ketamine. However, long term treatment with clozapine has been reported to decrease ketamine-induced positive symptoms. Pharmacological modulation of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, may lead to development of novel therapeutic agents for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia.
Today neomycin is almost exclusively given as an ointment in combination with other antibiotics, because of its known oto- and nephrotoxicity. Topical application in high dosage can cause ototoxicity as proved by one patient from this clinic. After laryngectomy and neck dissection for an extensive carcinoma of the epiglottis a 2 X 2 cm dehiscent pyocyaneus infected wound was treated daily with neomycin sulphate solution. A total of 30 gm was given over 3 months during which time the patient became deaf neomycin caused the deafness.
The JAK-STAT pathway mediates signaling by cytokines, which control survival, proliferation, and differentiation of a variety of cells. In recent years, a single point mutation (V617F) in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 was found to be present with a high incidence in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). This mutation led to hyperactivation of JAK2, cytokine-independent signaling, and subsequent activation of downstream signaling networks. The genetic, biological, and physiological evidence suggests that JAK2 inhibitors could be effective in treating MPDs. De novo design efforts of new scaffolds identified 1-amino-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-4-carboxamides as a new viable lead series. Subsequent optimization of cell potency, metabolic stability, and off-target activities of the leads led to the discovery of 7-(2-aminopyrimidin-5-yl)-1-{[(1R)-1-cyclopropyl-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl]amino}-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole-4-carboxamide (65). Compound 65 is a potent, orally active inhibitor of JAK2 with excellent selectivity, PK profile, and in vivo efficacy in animal models.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the major complication associated with artificial reproductive technologies. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of exogenous steroids to prevent OHSS without adversely affecting pregnancy rate. A prospective and randomized study including 945 consecutive cycles in 603 women (mean age 28.6 years) was carried out to evaluate the efficiency of high-dose progesterone and oestradiol administration during the luteal phase to prevent OHSS. After ovulation induction, patients were allocated by a series of computer-generated random numbers to receive either 5000 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) 4 and 8 days after embryo transfer (group 1, n = 534) or 500 mg hydroxy-progesterone caproate and 10 mg oestradiol valerate on days 2, 6, 10 and 14 after embryo transfer (group 2, n = 411), by i.m. injection. Total pregnancy rate was 24% (97 of 411) and 23% (121 of 534), and median serum progesterone concentrations on day 15 after embryo transfer were 5.8 ng ml(-1) (range 0.1-298) and 0.1 ng ml(-1) (range 0.1-372) in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.001). One hundred and sixty-three (30.5%) women in group 1 and 22 (5.4%) women in group 2 developed signs of OHSS (P < 0.0001). These results indicate that steroidal ovarian suppression during the luteal phase is a promising tool to reduce the incidence and severity of OHSS in a high-risk population without compromising the pregnancy rate.
To investigate the effects of alcohol intake on penile structure and function in rats.
Thirty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group and alcohol intake group. They were administered with 2 mL of normal saline and 40% alcohol solution respectively through gastric tubes every day. Three months later, the animal model of alcohol intake was evaluated by modified Nayagida's method, and the effects of alcohol on the rats were studied by sexual behavior, the number of apomorphine-induced penile erection, level of testosterone in the sera, and the content of penile smooth muscle.
The scores of animal model of alcohol intake evaluated by Nayagida's method were 0.66 +/- 2.05 in the control group and 9.26 +/- 5.50 in the alcohol intake group (P < 0.05), which indicated that an animal model of alcohol intake was successfully established. Sexual behavior, the number of apomorphine-induced penile erection, testosterone level in the sera, and the content of penile smooth muscle of the alcohol intake group were all statistically different as compared with the control group (P < 0.05).
Alcohol intake induces sexual dysfunction in rats, which may be due to the decline of testosterone level in the sera and decline of penile smooth muscle.
The sensitivity of pilocarpine-induced seizures to NMDA receptor blockade with MK-801, or to inhibition of synthesis of the second messenger nitric oxide (NO) with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), was studied in mice. The NO precursor L-arginine (100-500 mg/kg, IP) and L-NAME (1-125 mg/kg, IP) had no overt effects on animals' behaviour by themselves, while MK-801 (0.1-0.8 mg/kg, IP) caused motor excitability at low doses and sedation and paraplegia at high ones. Contrary to expectation, MK-801 and L-NAME failed to protect mice against limbic motor seizures induced by pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, IP), and L-arginine was not proconvulsant in mice challenged with a threshold convulsant dose of the cholinomimetic (100 mg/kg, IP). Surprisingly, both MK-801 and L-NAME were found to be proconvulsant when injected in conjunction with 100 mg/kg pilocarpine, and in both cases this convulsant action synergised with that produced by the dopamine D1 agonist SK&F38393 (10 mg/kg, IP). Concomitant administration of L-arginine (500 mg/kg) prevented the convulsant effect of 5 mg/kg L-NAME but was ineffective against 25 mg/kg L-NAME and MK-801. It is concluded that glutamate, acting through the NMDA receptor and NO production, normally suppresses epileptogenesis in the mouse pilocarpine model of limbic epilepsy.
The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are members of a family of endopeptidases that are able to degrade extra-cellular matrix. MMPs and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), play a key role in the migration of normal and malignant cell. Interaction of MMPs and TIMPs has been involved in the process of tumor invasion and metastasis. Using cDNA microarray as a screening tool to find androgen regulated gene in prostate cancer, we have found that expression of MMP-13 is regulated by androgen in prostate cancer derived cell line LNCaP. This regulation was further confirmed and quantified by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, the upregulation of MMP-13 mRNA by androgen could be abolished by the androgen antagonist Casodex but not the protein inhibitor cycloheximide. Western blot and immunohistochemistry of MMP-13 confirmed the androgen regulation at the protein level. We have furthermore shown that MMP-13 expression is presented in human prostate cancer obtained from aspiration biopsy. In summary, MMP-13 is androgen regulated and detectable in prostate cancer. Further study of MMP-13 in prostate cancer may help us to understand the progression of the cancer and can lead to new therapeutic options.
Lobeline inhibits [3H]nicotine binding to rat brain membranes and nicotine-induced [3H]dopamine release from superfused rat striatal slices, indicating that lobeline acts as a nicotinic receptor antagonist. To determine whether lobeline also inhibits the effects of nicotine in vivo, the present study assessed the effect of lobeline pretreatment on nicotine-induced hyperactivity and sensitization. For 12 consecutive days, rats were injected subcutaneously with lobeline (3 mg/kg) or saline, followed 10 min later by nicotine (0.3 mg/kg) or saline injection, and activity was monitored. To determine if lobeline inhibits induction of sensitization to nicotine, 1 or 28 days later, rats were pretreated with saline followed by nicotine or saline. Lobeline attenuated nicotine-induced hyperactivity when both drugs were administered repeatedly. Although an initial injection of lobeline produced hypoactivity, tolerance to this effect developed. Importantly, tolerance did not develop to the lobeline-induced attenuation of nicotine hyperactivity. Lobeline attenuated the induction of sensitization to nicotine 1 day, but not 28 days, after the cessation of lobeline treatment. These results demonstrate that systemic administration of lobeline attenuates the locomotor-activating effects of repeated nicotine injection and the sensitization to nicotine, consistent with lobeline inhibition of nicotinic receptors and/or neurotransmitter transporters.
To report a case of probable ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis.
A 76-year-old man with no known history of liver disease developed painless jaundice approximately 3 weeks after starting ticlopidine 250 mg bid. After ticlopidine was discontinued, the jaundice resolved and serum liver enzyme concentrations returned toward normal. A diagnosis of probable ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis was made. The patient was not rechallenged with ticlopidine.
A literature search produced 6 case reports describing 7 patients in whom probable ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis had been diagnosed. Only 1 of these reports appeared in the North American literature. Jaundice developed within 1 to 3 months of starting ticlopidine at less than or equal to the recommended daily dose. In all cases, jaundice resolved and serum liver enzyme concentrations normalized over a period of months after drug discontinuation.
Routine monitoring of serum liver enzyme concentrations is not recommended. However, patients should be instructed to watch for signs and symptoms of liver injury. Should they occur, patients should stop taking the ticlopidine and consult their physician immediately.
To report a case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in which intravenous quinidine was used, resulting in a prolonged QT interval.
P. falciparum malaria was diagnosed in a woman visiting from Nigeria. Treatment was instituted with intravenous quinidine given the high level of parasitemia. During the quinidine infusion, the patient experienced a prolonged QT interval and an episode of supraventricular tachycardia. The infusion rate was decreased and the QT duration returned to normal; there was no further episode of arrhythmia. Subsequently the patient was given oral quinine. Her condition improved and she was discharged on day 4 of therapy.
P. falciparum malaria, not commonly seen in the US, is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. This condition necessitates prompt treatment with intravenous quinidine, which can be associated with toxicity. The use of this agent to treat malaria is reviewed herein.
In patients with P. falciparum malaria, a high-level parasitemia may require treatment with a potentially toxic agent, intravenous quinidine. Cardiac monitoring of these patients is essential during such therapy.
During a study of efficacy of amantadine prophylaxis of influenza A virus infection in young adults, gross and subtle side effects were monitored. Eighty-eight students were randomly selected to receive either amantadine or placebo for four weeks or both in a sequential crossover design of two weeks each. Side effects (i.e., dizziness, nervousness, and insomnia) occurred in 33% of those receiving amantadine and in 10% of those receiving placebo (P less than 0.005). Although side effects were well tolerated by most subjects, six volunteers discontinued amantadine because of marked complaints. Cessation of side effects occurred in more than half of those continuing amantadine. Sixteen students receiving amantadine had decreased performance on sustained attention tasks as compared with ones receiving placebo (P less than 0.05). Gross and subtle side effects of amantadine observed in this study on currently recommended dosage are higher than previously reported, which may be an important factor in consideration of mass prophylaxis.
