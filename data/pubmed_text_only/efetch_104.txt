De novo posttransplant thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a complication of solid organ transplantation, which remains difficult to treat. In many cases, immunosuppressants and particularly calcineurin inhibitors, trigger TMA. Although withdrawing the offending drug may lead to resolution of TMA, graft and patient outcomes are poor. Specific treatments, including plasma exchange, have not gained widespread acceptance in those with fulminant disease and new approaches to the condition are urgently needed. We report a case of posttransplant de novo TMA presenting serially in association with ciclosporin, tacrolimus and sirolimus in a young recipient of a living donor kidney transplant. We describe a patient treated with belatacept, a novel CTLA4 Ig fusion protein, as ongoing maintenance immunosuppression to allow avoidance of conventional agents once associated with TMA. We report excellent early graft outcome, with no adverse events using this strategy. We suggest that belatacept may have a role in this traditionally difficult-to-treat group of patients.
The interactions of calcium-regulating hormones, active forms of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone, and aspirin were studied in rats. Aspirin, a prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibitor, abolished the hypercalcemia induced by 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 at 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg p.o. in parathyroidectomized or thyroparathyroidectomized rats with or without vitamin D deficiency, and in thyroparathyroidectomized plus nephrectomized rats. Aspirin did not affect the stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption by 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3. By contrast, indomethacin, another prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibitor, did not affect hypercalcemia or stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption by 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3. Aspirin also abolished the hypercalcemic action of parathyroid hormone in rats with or without intact thyroparathyroid glands. Moreover, aspirin alone caused hypocalcemia in rats with intact thyroparathyroid glands. Indomethacin had no effect in either of these systems. These data suggest that aspirin may inhibit bone resorption by the active form of vitamin D or parathyroid hormone via a mechanism independent of prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibition.
The taste function and the zinc and copper levels in serum and urine were followed for up tp 16 weeks in ten patients who were started on penicillamine therapy for generalized scleroderma (9 patients) and rheumatoid arthritis (one patient). During therapy the serum zinc concentration remained unchanged, whereas the serum copper concentration increased significantly during the first 4--5 weeks and then tended to decrease. Urinary copper rose significantly and remained considerably above the upper normal limit throughout the study. Six of the patients complained after about 4--5 weeks of a decreased taste function, which was gradually restored whether the medication was stopped or continued. The alterations in the taste acuity for sweet, salt, sour, and bitter significantly paralleled the variations in urinary copper before as well as during therapy. Thus, the patients who showed the most pronounced loss of taste, had a lower urinary copper output than those whose taste acuity was less disturbed.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) is a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome that affects tissues derived from neural ectoderm. It is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and phaeochromocytoma. The MEN2A gene has recently been localized by a combination of genetic and physical mapping techniques to a 480-kilobase region in chromosome 10q11.2 (refs 2,3). The DNA segment encompasses the RET proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase gene expressed in MTC and phaeochromocytoma and at lower levels in normal human thyroid. This suggested RET as a candidate for the MEN2A gene. We have identified missense mutations of the RET proto-oncogene in 20 of 23 apparently distinct MEN 2A families, but not in 23 normal controls. Further, 19 of these 20 mutations affect the same conserved cysteine residue at the boundary of the RET extracellular and transmembrane domains.
To assess the efficacy and safety of every-other-week darbepoetin alfa therapy in treating anemia and maintaining hemoglobin levels for 1 year in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were not undergoing dialysis and who had not previously received erythropolesis-stimulating proteins (ESPs).
This multicenter 52-week study (evaluation period, weeks 20-32), a subanalysis of the Simplify the Treatment of Anemia with Aranesp study, enrolled patients with CKD who were not receiving dialysis (creatinine clearance < or =70 mL/min or estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < or =60 mL/min). Patients evaluated in this analysis were not receiving ESPs, had hemoglobin concentrations less than 11 g/dL, and had transferrin saturation of 20% or higher during screening. Patients Initiated every-other-week darbepoetin alfa therapy at 0.75 microg/kg, with the dose subsequently titrated to maintain hemoglobin levels not to exceed 12 g/dL. The first study participant was enrolled on February 4, 2002, and the last participant completed the study on March 31, 2004.
The analysis included 911 patients (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [14.2] years; 54.3% female; 55.3% white). The least squares mean evaluation hemoglobin concentration was 11.54 g/dL (95% confidence interval, 11.47-11.61 g/dL), and the change from baseline was 1.6 g/dL (95% confidence interval, 1.5-1.7 g/dL). The mean (SD) every-other-week darbepoetin alfa dose during evaluation was 44.5 (33.7) microg. Iron supplementation was administered to 573 patients (62.9%) during the study. Darbepoetin alfa was well tolerated throughout the study period.
Darbepoetin alfa initiated every other week safely and effectively treated anemia and maintained hemoglobin for 1 year in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis and who were not receiving prior ESP therapy.
Although coeliac disease is a disorder of the proximal small bowel, associated vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of B12 deficiency in a large series of coeliac patients, and to exclude the possibility that it is due to associated autoimmune gastritis.
Prospective routine measurement of serum B12 in coeliac patients, with investigations for pernicious anaemia/autoimmune gastritis in B12-deficient patients.
Gastroenterology department of a large district general hospital.
If they were not taking vitamin B12 supplements already, patients had serum B12 measured before starting dietary gluten exclusion. Those with low levels also had gastric biopsies taken and plasma gastrin and serum gastric parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies measured.
Prevalence of low serum B12, and presence or absence of indicators of pernicious anaemia/autoimmune gastritis in patients with low serum B12.
Of 159 patients, 13 had low serum B12 at diagnosis. A further six had been receiving B12 replacement therapy for 3-37 years before diagnosis, giving an overall prevalence of 12% (19 patients). Only 2/19 patients had gastric corpus atrophy, one with intrinsic factor antibodies and the other with hypergastrinaemia. There was no relationship between low B12 and clinical characteristics.
Low B12 is common in coeliac disease without concurrent pernicious anaemia, and may be a presenting manifestation. B12 status should be known before folic acid replacement is started.
An unexpectedly high number of initially suspected cocaine-intoxicated patients was presented to a general hospital in Lelystad, The Netherlands. Based on the unusual toxidram rate of not fitting cocaine intoxication, the suspicion of co-presence of an anticholinergic agent was raised. A newly developed HPLC-MS/MS analytical method revealed the presence of 10% atropine in a cocaine sample retrieved and subsequently in the sera of 6 intoxicated patients.
Immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial dysmorphism syndrome, characterized by variable immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies caused by epigenetic dysregulation resulting in hypomethylation, is caused in many patients by mutations in DNMT3B, a DNA methyltransferase gene; associated infections are a major cause of serious sequelae and death. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may improve the clinical course in immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial dysmorphism syndrome. We report 3 unrelated patients with persistent infections and intestinal complications who successfully underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after nonmyeloablative or myeloablative conditioning regimens using HLA-matched donors. In all cases, donor chimerism led to resolution of intestinal complications and infections, growth improvement, and correction of the immunodeficiency.
The use of analgesics for procedural pain management in the newborn infant has been steadily increasing during the past decade. With this trend of increased analgesic utilization, there is the potential for infants to suffer from drug-induced side effects. There also is the potential to wrongfully blame drugs for all adverse events that occur during analgesic use. Two adverse events that occurred in a neonate exposed to tetracaine gel and the probability that the adverse events were caused by the drug are presented. During administration of the topical local anesthetic tetracaine for analgesia during percutaneous central venous catheter placement, a preterm infant experienced bradycardia. Several hours later, a local cutaneous reaction that progressed to skin desquamation occurred at the site. The authors assessed the probability that tetracaine caused 2 adverse events using a validated adverse drug reaction probability scale by Naranjo et al. According to the algorithm developed by Naranjo et al, it was determined that bradycardia was unlikely caused by the drug; however, the dermal reaction was probably the result of the drug.The authors determined that tetracaine caused a serious local skin reaction, but not bradycardia, in a preterm infant. This is the first report of a serious skin reaction in a neonate treated with tetracaine. Based on these findings, tetracaine gel can continue to be used to treat pain in neonates with careful evaluation of the skin.
To determine the threshold dose of piperonyl butoxide (PBO) that induces hepatocellular tumor-promoting effects, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and drug-metabolizing enzymes that protect against ROS generation, partial hepatectomized rats were fed diets containing 0, 0.015, 0.03, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, or 0.5% PBO after an i.p. injection of N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. Histopathologically, Glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in rats given 0.25% PBO or higher. The formation of microsomal ROS in the liver was significantly increased in 0.25 and 0.5% PBO. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of the CYP1A1, UDPGTr-2, and Mrp3 genes was significantly upregulated in rats given 0.03% PBO or higher. These results suggest that 0.25% is the threshold dose of PBO that induces ROS-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis in rats, although the CYP1A1 gene that is related to ROS generation and the UDPGTr-2 and Mrp3 genes that are involved in protection against ROS were induced in the livers of rats even at a PBO dose of 0.03%.
The current study was designed to determine the cardiovascular effect of centrally administrated melittin, a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activator, and the mediation of central thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and its receptors in normotensive conscious rats. Studies were performed in normotensive male Sprague Dawley rats injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with melittin. Melittin (1.5, 3.0, 6.0 microg/5.0 microl; i.c.v.) caused dose- and time-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and decrease in heart rate (HR). Maximal effects were observed 5-10 min after 3.0 microg dose of melittin. In order to test the mediation of central TXA2 and its central receptors in the cardiovascular effect of melittin, the rats were pretreated with furegrelate (500.0 microg; i.c.v.), a TXA2 synthesis inhibitor, and SQ-29548 (8.0 microg; i.c.v.), a TXA2 receptor antagonist, 15 min prior to melittin (3.0 microg). Furegrelate or SQ-29548 partially inhibited the pressor effect and bradycardia elicited by melittin. In conclusion, our findings show that centrally administered melittin increases MAP and decreases HR in conscious rats. Moreover, according to our findings, central TXA2 and its receptors may in part mediate melittin-induced cardiovascular effects.
Phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) is an important regulator of cAMP-mediated responses within the cardiovascular system. PDE3 exists as two subtypes: PDE3A and PDE3B, with distinct cellular and subcellular locations. Due to the lack of subtype-specific pharmacological tools, the definitive role of each subtype in regulating cardiovascular function has not been determined. In this study, we investigated platelet and cardiac function, using PDE3A and PDE3B gene knockout (KO) mice. Platelet-rich-plasma was prepared from the blood of KO and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. PGE1 (1 microg/mL) almost completely inhibited aggregation of platelets from WT, PDE3A KO and PDE3B KO mice. In platelets from WT mice, cilostamide (100 microM), a selective PDE3 inhibitor, blocked collagen- and ADP-induced aggregation. In contrast, cilostamide had no effect on aggregation of platelets from PDE3A KO mice. In PDE3B KO mice, inhibition of collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that in WT mice. The resting intra-platelet cAMP concentration in platelets from PDE3A KO mice was twice that in the WT platelets. After PGE1 (0.1 microg/mL) stimulation, intra-cellular cAMP concentration was increased significantly more in platelets from PDE3A KO mice compared to WT mice. In vivo, PDE3A KO mice were protected against collagen/epinephrine-induced pulmonary thrombosis and death, while no such protection was observed in PDE3B KO mice. The heart rate of PDE3A KO mice was significantly higher, compared with age-matched WT mice, while that of PDE3B KO mice was similar to WT. There was no difference in cardiac contractility between PDE3A or PDE3B KO mice. Heart rate and contractility were increased in a similar dose-dependent fashion by isoproterenol in both types of KO mice. Cilostamide increased heart rate and contractility in WT and PDE3B KO but not in PDE3A KO mice. Compared to WT and PDE3B KO mice, cyclic AMP-PDE activity in membrane fractions prepared from the hearts of PDE3A KO mice was lower and not inhibited by cilostamide. The data suggest that PDE3A is the main subtype of PDE3 expressed in platelets and cardiac ventricular myocytes, and is responsible for the functional changes caused by PDE3 inhibition.
Chlordiazepoxide 40mg daily was used to prevent delerium tremens in a 64-year-old female with alcoholic liver disease. After 20 days, the drug was stopped because of the onset of progressive drowsiness. The kinetics of chloridazepoxide were within the predicted range for patients with liver disease, but the elimination half-lives of desmethylchlordiazepoxide and demoxepam were greatly prolonged at 346 hours and 150 hours, respectively. It is suggested that metabolite accumulation may have contributed to the coma, which is an unusual reaction to chlordiazepoxide.
Ewing tumours, i.e. Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumours, are the second most common primary malignant tumours of bone in childhood and adolescence, with an annual incidence rate in Caucasians of 3 per 1 million children <15 years of age. Histopathologically small blue round cell tumours, Ewing tumours show a typical chromosomal rearrangement in >95% of cases linking the EWS gene on chromosome 22q12 to a member of the ETS transcription gene family, most commonly to Fli-1 on 11q24. This fusion contributes to the malignant potential of Ewing tumour cells, indeed antisense oligonucleotides may prevent tumour growth in vitro. After open biopsy, and histological and possibly molecular biological confirmation of the diagnosis, treatment consists of several months of multidrug cytostatic therapy and local therapy. Both surgery and radiotherapy may control local disease, but without consequent cytostatic chemotherapy all patients will eventually succumb to distant metastases. With the use of alkylating agents including doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and/or ifosfamide, and other cytostatic drugs such as actinomycin D (dactinomycin), vincristine and etoposide, long-term survival can be achieved in >50% of patients with localised disease. Patients with clinically detectable metastases at diagnosis, patients not responding to therapy and patients with disease relapse have a significantly poorer prognosis. Maximum supportive care and local therapy managed by an experienced physician are required in all patients, and inclusion of high-risk patients in phase I and II studies is warranted. Hence, treatment of patients with Ewing tumours should be performed in experienced centres only and preferably within controlled clinical trials.
Whereas observations of psychotic disorders induced by amphetamines are common, few observations described the impact of chronic amphetamine abuse on schizophrenic patients. We report the case of a schizophrenic patient who presented with amphetamine dependence for several years, without other accompanying addiction.
During his adolescence, Mr. X. gradually developed delusional beliefs of persecution and telepathy. He believed that the other pupils and teachers spoke about him in malicious terms. At the age of 23, Mr. X began to consume 60-100 mg/week of amphetamines orally. He consumed amphetamines during 7 years. The delusions, in particular the auditory hallucinations worsened after the use of amphetamines. Subsequently, he married and was declared unfit for national service due to the psychotic disorders. Mr. X received neuroleptic treatment with moderate effects on the psychotic symptoms. Between the age of 24 and 30, the patient presented persecutory, megalomanic and physical transformation beliefs, delusions of being controlled as well as auditory, somatic-tactile and visual hallucinations. At the age of 30, while he had stopped his consumption of amphetamines for 9 months, the patient, overwhelmed with the delusions, murdered his wife. He was sent in jail for 13 months, and subsequently hospitalized for one year in a high security psychiatric department and 7 years in our psychiatric department. The neuroleptic treatment was effective, particularly against the hallucinations. Following stabilisation, the symptomatology of the patient was marked by a disorganization syndrome, including prominent thought disorder, disorganized speech, associative loosening, frequent derailments and negative signs of schizophrenia, in particular affective flattening and blunting of emotional expression. When the patient was 43, a trial discharge was authorized owing to improvement of his condition. The neuroleptic treatment was switched with single-drug olanzapine therapy, 10 mg/day which improved the negative symptoms. Mr. X. resumed part-time professional activities and remarried.
The patient fulfilled the DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia and for amphetamine dependence assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). He presented, in particular, withdrawal syndrome when amphetamines were discontinued. The amphetamine consumption was followed by a marked deterioration in the delusions, particularly the hallucinations. Worsening of the positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients by amphetamines has been established in single dose studies, in particular characterized by persecutory delusions and hallucinations. On the other hand, amphetamines tend to transiently and moderately reduce the negative symptoms. Some stu-dies have shown that amphetamine consumption promoted violent acting out in non-schizophrenic subjects. In our observation, the acting out may be not related to the acute effects of these substances, since it occurred 9 months after stated discontinuation of amphetamine consumption. However, the cerebral toxicity and psycho-behavioural disturbances related to amphetamines might be prolonged after withdrawal. In non-schizophrenic patients, the existence of prolonged neurotoxicity of amphetamines and related psycho-behavioral disturbances has been suggested. The prolonged administration of amphetamines to animals produces neuro-axonal degeneration in the striatum, the frontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala. In human, there are some evidence of persistant deteriorations of the serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems in the caudate nucleus, the putamen and the nucleus accumbens following amphetamine consumption.
The neurobiological and psycho-behavioural effects of amphetamines may be prolonged following withdrawal in both schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic patients.
Experiments were performed to characterize the interaction of intravenous dipyridamole and aminophylline on thallium-201 transport kinetics, regional myocardial blood flow and systemic hemodynamics in the presence of a critical coronary artery stenosis. In 12 dogs with a critical left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, arterial pressure decreased from a mean value (+/- SEM) of 107 +/- 6 to 94 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and distal left anterior descending artery pressure decreased from 70 +/- 7 to 55 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after intravenous administration of dipyridamole (0.25 mg/kg body weight). In the left anterior descending perfusion zone, the endocardial/epicardial flow ratio decreased from 0.70 to 0.36 and the intrinsic thallium washout rate was significantly prolonged. Intravenous aminophylline (5 mg/kg) reversed the dipyridamole-induced systemic hypotension and transmural coronary steal and restored the thallium washout rate to baseline values. In six other dogs, aminophylline alone resulted in no alterations in systemic and coronary hemodynamics or regional myocardial blood flow. As expected, dipyridamole-induced vasodilation and coronary steal were prevented by aminophylline pretreatment. These data show that in a canine model of partial coronary stenosis, systemic hypotension, adverse regional flow effects (coronary steal) and prolonged thallium-201 washout consequent to intravenously administered dipyridamole are promptly reversed by intravenous aminophylline administration. Aminophylline alone had no significant hemodynamic and coronary flow effects. This study provides further insight into the altered thallium kinetics occurring as a consequence of dipyridamole-induced vasodilation and suggests that the prompt reversal of symptoms and signs of ischemia with aminophylline in patients receiving intravenous dipyridamole for clinical imaging studies probably reflects the reversal of transmural coronary steal.
Significant regression of radiation (RT) -induced fibrosis (RIF) has been achieved after treatment combining pentoxifylline (PTX) and alpha-tocopherol (vitE). In this study, we focus on the maximum response, how long it takes to achieve response, and changes after treatment discontinuation.
Measurable superficial RIF was assessed in patients treated by RT for breast cancer in a long-treatment (24 to 48 months) PTX-vitE (LPE) group of 37 patients (47 RIFs) and in a short-treatment (6 to 12 months) PTX-vitE (SPE) group of seven patients (eight RIFs). Between April 1995 and April 2000, women were treated with a daily combination of PTX (800 mg) and VitE (1,000 IU).
Combined PTX-vitE was continuously effective and resulted in exponential RIF surface area regression (-46% for LPE and -68% for SPE at 6 months, -58% for LPE and -69% for SPE at 12 months, -63% for LPE and -62% for SPE at 18 months, and -68% for LPE at 24 and 36 months). The mean estimated maximal treatment effect was 68% RIF surface area regression. The mean time to this effect was 24 months and was shorter (16 months) in more recent RIF (< 6 years since RT) than in older RIF (28 months; P = .0003). Symptom severity (Subjective Objective Medical Management and Analytic Evaluation score) was halved in both groups. After treatment discontinuation, mean RIF surface area at 1 year had increased by +40% in the SPE group (rebound) and +8.5% in the LPE group.
Under combined PTX-vitE treatment, RIF regression was exponential, with a two-thirds maximum response after a mean of 2 years. There was a risk of a rebound effect if treatment was too short. Long treatment (>/= 3 years) is recommended in patients with severe RIF.
Gentamicin-associated acute renal failure was diagnosed in 10 dogs. The disease was characterized by a poor prognosis and lengthy hospitalization. Hypoalbuminemia, disorders of potassium homeostasis, proteinuria, hematuria, and cylindruria were common during therapy for renal failure. Fever and dehydration were the most commonly identified potential predisposing factors.
The objective of this study was to further investigate the efficacy and safety of low-dose outpatient chemobiotherapy in patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma.
Thirty-one patients with histologically confirmed unresectable measurable metastatic melanoma were enrolled onto an open-label, multicenter phase II study. The treatment regimen consisted of oral temozolomide followed by subcutaneous biotherapy with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-alfa, and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2).
Twenty-eight patients (90%) had M1c disease, and 58% had three or more sites of metastasis. Four patients (13%), all with M1c disease, had a complete response, and four patients had a partial response. The median progression-free survival was 4.9 months and the median overall survival was 13.1 months. Two patients (6%) developed CNS metastasis as the first site of disease progression, and 7 (23%) of 30 experienced CNS progression after receiving chemobiotherapy. A total of 112 cycles of therapy were administered. Toxicity occurred in 78% of the cycles and was grade 1 or 2 in the majority of cases and easily managed. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 3% of the cycles.
This low-dose chemobiotherapy combination produces clinical responses in patients with metastatic melanoma, even in those with M1c disease, is well tolerated, and allows home dosing. It offers a reasonable alternative to high-dose regimens, such as high-dose biochemotherapy or rIL-2 requiring prolonged periods of hospitalization, or single agent outpatient regimens, such as dacarbazine, which is usually not effective in patients with M1c disease. Furthermore, it may protect against the development of brain metastases.
A case of acute renal failure developing at two separate times after the use of diphenylhydantoin is described. On both occasions the patient also had other manifestations of a hypersensitivity reaction and recovered normal renal function after the withdrawal of the drug and institution of corticosteroid therapy.
In the current study, nefazodone, an antidepressant with dual action on serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake as well as 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist effects, was studied in subjects with cocaine dependence and depressive symptoms, to determine its efficacy in reducing cocaine use.
An 8-week, double blind, placebo-controlled design was used.
The study was conducted at the Medication Development Research Unit (MDRU) at the VA Boston Healthcare System and the Manhattan Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) Medical Center.
Subjects (n = 69) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) criteria for cocaine dependence and had Hamilton Depression Scores of 12 or higher.
Subjects were assigned randomly to receive nefazodone 200 mg twice daily (n = 34) or matching placebo (n = 35). All subjects received individual counseling.
Urinary measurements of benzoylecgonine (BE, three times per week) and self-reports of cocaine use were the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures included assessments of psychiatric functioning, cocaine craving and social functioning.
Median weekly BE declined more rapidly in the nefazodone than in the placebo group. Median urine BE at baseline was, however, significantly greater in nefazodone than in the placebo group. Scores for strength of cocaine craving also decreased more rapidly in the nefazodone group compared to the placebo group. Both groups had equivalent improvement in mood, psychosocial functioning and self-reported cocaine use.
These results suggest that nefazodone administration can reduce cocaine craving after it has been administered for several weeks. Although the nefazodone group had a greater rate of decrease in BE levels than the placebo group, the interpretation of this finding is obscured by significant group differences in baseline BE levels.
Temozolomide (TMZ) has shown efficacy in metastatic melanoma equal to that of dacarbazine (DTIC), the standard chemotherapeutic agent for melanoma. As the combination with interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) appears superior to single-agent DTIC regarding response rates, the purpose of this study was to compare TMZ alone and TMZ plus IFN-alpha in terms of objective response (OR), overall survival, and safety in a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial.
Two hundred ninety-four patients with untreated stage IV metastatic melanoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system) were randomly assigned to receive either oral TMZ alone (200 mg/m2/day; days 1 through 5 every 28 days) or in combination with subcutaneous IFN-alpha (5 MU/m2; days 1, 3, and 5 every week).
Two hundred eighty-two patients were eligible for an intent-to-treat analysis, 271 patients were treated per protocol. In the TMZ + IFN-alpha arm, 33 (24.1%) of 137 patients responded to therapy (partial or complete remission) whereas in the monotherapy arm, in 18 (13.4%) of 134 patients, a response was evident. Thus, the response rate was significantly higher in the combination arm (P = .036). Median survival time was 8.4 months for patients treated with TMZ (95% CI, 7.07 to 9.27) and 9.7 months for those treated with the combination (95% CI, 8.26 to 11.18; P = .16). Dose modifications and interval prolongations due to hematologic toxicity were significantly more frequent in the TMZ + IFN-alpha arm (P < .001).
In metastatic melanoma treatment with TMZ + IFN-alpha leads to a significantly superior OR rate compared to treatment with TMZ alone, which did not translate into prolonged survival in our study population.
To analyze action of digoxin and some non-digitalis drugs (beta-blockers, verapamil, amiodarone, d,l-sotalol) and their combinations on electrical activity of atria, frequency and structure of ventricular rhythm in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation.
One hundred patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and heart rate at rest above 80 bpm were divided into 9 treatment groups. High-resolution orthogonal Frank lead ECG was recorded before and after allocated treatment. Analysis included construction of ff-waves periodograms, histograms of RR interval, cardiointervalograms and application of autocorrelation function.
It was demonstrated that frequency and form (structure) of ventricular rhythm was determined not only by the state of AV conduction but also by value of basic period of ff-waves. The mechanisms of ventricular rate deceleration by investigated drugs were not identical. beta-blockers and verapamil directly slowed AV conduction without changing parameters of ff-waves and differed from each other only in action on parameters of concealed conduction in AV node. Action of digoxin in patients with ff-waves period equal to or exceeding 0,15 s was biphasic. During phase I shortening of ff-wave period (by 0.025+/-0.012 s) occurred. This was associated with increase of their concealed conduction through AV node. The latter phenomenon represented independent mechanism of ventricular rhythm deceleration. During phase II of digoxin action direct inhibition of AV conduction took place. Amiodarone and d,l-sotalol increased basic ff-waves period. This facilitated their conduction through AV node. Greater heart rate slowing effect of d,l-sotalol was attributed to its ability to augment concealed conduction. Due to their antiarrhythmic qualities amiodarone and d,l-sotalol slowed heart rate in patients with peak RR duration in the region of 0.28-0.46 s. These patients often had bi- and tri-modal structure of interval RR histogram. Changes of ventricular rhythm structure during use of various drugs were different. Action of digoxin was most whilst that of beta-blockers least favorable.
Choice of a drug for treatment of permanent atrial fibrillation should be conducted with consideration of ff-waves periodicity, parameters of RR interval histogram, and characteristics of ventricular rhythm structure.
Endoscopic mucosal resection is a widely accepted technique for the treatment of early gastric cancers, while large ulcers induced by the treatment should be treated promptly. This study aimed to compare the effects of omeprazole and famotidine on ulcer healing and fibroblast growth factor-2 levels in gastric ulcers induced by endoscopic mucosal resection.
Sixteen patients indicated for endoscopic mucosal resection were enrolled. They were treated by using either omeprazole (n = 8) or famotidine (n = 8) after endoscopic mucosal resection. Endoscopy was performed on days 4, 7 and 28 during each treatment period. Levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 in biopsy specimens were measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at the time of and after endoscopic mucosal resection. Histological variables were also assessed.
Ulcer healing rates under endoscopy were not different between the two treatment groups. In both groups, levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 slightly increased on day 4, but the values were not different at any time point. There were no differences in histological variables on days 4 and 7, but fibromuscular hyperplasia was significantly greater in the omeprazole group than in the famotidine group on day 28 (P < 0.05).
Omeprazole and famotidine have an equivalent value for the treatment of ulcers induced by endoscopic mucosal resection. While omeprazole had a more potent effect on fibromuscular hyperplasia than did famotidine, such a difference does not seem to be explained by fibroblast growth factor-2.
One of the targets of anti-hypertensive treatment is cardiovascular structural and functional improvements, while the level of blood pressure (BP) under treatment is related to patient morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation of BP achieved after felodipine monotherapy to the degree of cardiovascular changes. Six hundred patients with essential hypertension were studied and grouped according to diastolic BP (DBP) levels after 6 months of therapy: 90-94 (n = 86), 85-89 (n = 186), 80-84 (n = 180) and < 80 mm Hg (n = 148). Overall BP fell from 175/103 to 137/83 mm Hg with a concomitant moderate reflex tachycardia (3.3%). Left ventricular (LV) dimensions decreased to a degree (-0.4 and -0.8%, P < 0.0001), with the greatest decrease in patients with lower DBP levels under treatment (P < 0.0001). LV systolic function improved to a modest degree (0.8%, P < 0.0001), depending on DBP fall (P < 0.0001), as did cardiac output (2.4%, P < 0.0001). LV systolic wall stress and total peripheral resistance fell (-18% and -14%, P < 0.0001) in relation to DBP drop (P < 0.0001), as did aortic root distensibility (55%, P < 0.0001). It is concluded that the degree of cardiovascular structure and function improvements are directly related to the DBP levels achieved under felodipine anti-hypertensive therapy.
Isoproterenol was continuously administered to rats at a rate of 2.5 microg/kg/min for 7 days via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. This treatment induced cardiac hypertrophy with increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) density decreased in hypertrophied hearts, but the affinity for 125I-cyanopindolol did not change. The beta-AR density decrease did not accompany the change in expression of beta1-AR mRNA. In hypertrophied hearts, adenylyl cyclase activities in the steady state, and stimulated with isoproterenol, forskolin, and manganese, decreased but there was no change in the expression of adenylyl cyclase type V mRNA. The results suggest that beta-AR downregulation and adenylyl cyclase desensitization in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy are caused by post-transcriptional changes.
Allergic reactions to midriatic eyedrops are rare despite extensively used by ophthalmologists. Phenylephrine is responsible for 54-95% of cases reported in literature. We present the case of a 56-year-old man with blepharoconjunctivitis after instillation of phenylephrine 5%, tropicamide 0.5%, oxibuprocaine eyedrops. The patient reported good tolerance to the mentioned drugs. Immediate readings of prick and intradermal tests, performed with the suspected drugs, were negative. Late readings (48 and 72 hours) of epicutaneous tests were also negative. At 72 hours, prick and intradermal tests to phenylephrine were positive. Allergic blepharoconjunctivitis to phenylephrine was diagnosed. Phenylephrine is an extensively used midriatic that can act as a potent sensitizing agent and can be the cause of allergic contact reactions in exposed patients. With this case we illustrate the relevance of late readings of intradermal tests in the diagnosis of late hypersensitivity drug reactions. The authors discuss about possible mechanisms responsible for negative results of epicutaneous tests.
