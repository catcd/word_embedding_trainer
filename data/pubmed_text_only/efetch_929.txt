Metolazone-induced acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia are described in a 58-year-old woman with severe congestive cardiac failure. Her symptoms and laboratory abnormalities rapidly resolved upon discontinuation of metolazone. Both clinical and laboratory findings make other etiologies for the patient's pancreatitis extremely unlikely. The pathophysiology of thiazide-related hypercalcemia and pancreatitis is reviewed. To our knowledge, neither hypercalcemia nor the combination of acute pancreatitis with hypercalcemia has been reported previously in association with metolazone therapy, and the association of pancreatitis and metolazone has been noted previously only once.
The inability of opioids to control pain over time may be influenced by different factors such as drug tolerance, hyperalgesia due to repeated morphine administration or progression of the original disease. In addition, chronic pain may alter morphine tolerance development. This study examined whether chronic morphine exposure differently affects mechanical and thermal stimulus evoked pain-related behaviour in non-operated, nerve-injured and sham-operated rats. Further, we studied the effect of nerve injury and sham surgery on the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine. Vocalization thresholds to paw pressure and struggle latencies to hindpaw immersion into a 46 degrees C hot-water bath were determined in groups of non-operated rats, nerve-injured (chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve) and sham-operated rats. Immediately thereafter, pretreatment regimens with s.c. injections of either saline or morphine (10 mg/kg) were started. Injections were given twice daily on post-operative days 12-15, when the abnormal pain behaviour in nerve-injured rats is at a stable maximum. On day 16, the effect of an acute dose of i.v. morphine (1 mg/kg) was tested. On day 12 the baseline vocalization threshold and struggle latency were decreased in nerve-injured but not in non- and sham-operated rats. Morphine pretreatment further decreased the vocalization threshold in nerve-injured rats and induced threshold reductions in non- and sham-operated rats. In the thermal test, morphine pretreatment produced no change in baseline latencies in any of the groups. Following morphine pretreatment, acute i.v. morphine on day 16 remained effective against both mechanical and thermal stimuli in non-operated rats, but was strongly reduced in nerve-injured rats. Sham-operated rats displayed a tendency towards a reduced effect of i.v. morphine after morphine pretreatment in the mechanical but not in the thermal test. The results suggest that mechanical afferent systems may be more sensitive to hyperalgesia associated with repetitive morphine injections than thermal systems and that nerve injury facilitates the development of tolerance to morphine analgesia.
The authors present a patient in whom colocolic intussusception occurred as a result of bowel wall ischemia and hematoma. Imaging features and pathogenesis of bowel ischemia and intussusception will be briefly discussed, as well as its relationship to cocaine abuse. The importance of recognizing complications of cocaine abuse in today's emergency department patient population will be emphasized.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, induces cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury via opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels. It is unclear whether sildenafil would provide similar protection from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
Male ICR mice were randomized to 1 of 4 treatments: saline, sildenafil, doxorubicin (5 mg/kg IP), and sildenafil (0.7 mg/kg IP) plus doxorubicin (n=6 per group). Apoptosis was assessed with the use of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling and in situ oligo ligation methods. Desmin distribution was determined via immunofluorescence. Bcl-2 expression was analyzed by Western blot. Left ventricular function was assessed by measuring developed pressure and rate pressure product in Langendorff mode. ECG changes indicative of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity were also measured. For in vitro studies, adult ventricular cardiomyocytes were exposed to doxorubicin (1 micromol/L), sildenafil (1 micromol/L) with or without N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (100 micromol/L), or 5-hydroxydecanoate (100 micromol/L) 1 hour before doxorubicin and incubated for 18 hours. Doxorubicin-treated mice demonstrated increased apoptosis and desmin disruption, which was attenuated in the sildenafil+doxorubicin group. Bcl-2 was decreased in the doxorubicin group but was maintained at basal levels in the sildenafil+doxorubicin group. Left ventricular developed pressure and rate pressure product were significantly depressed in the doxorubicin group but were attenuated in the sildenafil+doxorubicin group. ST interval was significantly increased in the doxorubicin group over 8 weeks. In the sildenafil+doxorubicin group, ST interval remained unchanged from baseline. Doxorubicin caused a significant increase in apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential in vitro. In contrast, sildenafil significantly protected against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity; however, this protection was abolished by both L-NAME and 5-hydroxydecanoate.
Prophylactic treatment with sildenafil prevented apoptosis and left ventricular dysfunction in a chronic model of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Cyclophosphamide is a well established cytotoxic drug used in the treatment of lymphoproliferative disorders, certain solid tumors, and nonneoplastic disorders such as nephrotic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Hemorrhagic cystitis can be a complication of this drug varying between two and 40 per cent. Misoprostol, which is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog, was found to significantly decrease the histological damage to the bladder from cyclophosphamide. Male rats receiving misoprostol in conjunction with cyclophosphamide were found to have a reduction in ulceration, inflammation and edema of the bladder walls as compared to those treated with cyclophosphamide alone.
Since systemic administration of synthetic retinoids was introduced into dermatology and oncology, side-effects of synthetic vitamin-A derivatives on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism have become apparent. Retinoids of the first and second generation, 13-cis-retinoic acid and etretinate, are capable of inducing secondary hyperlipoproteinemias. For further evaluation of the atherogenic risk of retinoid-induced hyperlipoproteinemias, the most relevant effects of natural and synthetic retinoids on lipid metabolism as well as the interactions between lipid and retinoid metabolism are considered in this review.
Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with levodopa (L-dopa) induces dyskinesia that, once established, is provoked by each dose of L-dopa or a dopamine (DA) agonist. In contrast, monoamine reuptake inhibitors may reverse motor deficits in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated primates without provoking established involuntary movements. We now examine whether the potent monoamine reuptake blocker BTS 74 398 induces established dyskinesia in MPTP-treated common marmosets primed previously with L-dopa and whether co-administration of BTS 74 398 with L-dopa potentiates motor behaviour and dyskinesia induced by acute L-dopa treatment. Administration of BTS 74 398 (2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg, p.o.) in MPTP-treated common marmosets increased locomotor activity and reduced motor disability in a dose-related manner but did not provoke involuntary movements. BTS 74 398 (2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg p.o.) co-administered with a threshold dose of L-dopa (2.5 mg/kg p.o.) did not evoke a motor response or induce dyskinesia. Similarly, concomitant administration of BTS 74 398 (5.0 mg/kg p.o.) with a submaximal L-dopa dose (12.5 mg/kg p.o.) did not potentiate the motor response produced by L-dopa alone and there was no alteration in the dyskinesia provoked by L-dopa challenge. BTS 74 398 reverses motor abnormalities in MPTP-treated marmosets without evoking established dyskinesia but no additive improvement occurs when administered in combination with L-dopa. The lack of synergy with L-dopa may suggest different sites of drug action.
This case illustrates that patients receiving ritodrine for preterm labor may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of ritodrine and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section. Such interactions may result in serious cardiovascular complications even after cessation of an infusion of ritodrine. Preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum potassium level. Delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible. Careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of ephedrine are advised. After delivery of the infant, there should be no contraindication to the use of an alpha-adrenergic vasopressor such as phenylephrine to treat hypotensive patients with tachycardia.
Twenty-nine elderly patients who failed treatment with clozapine, risperidone, or olanzapine entered this 24-week, single-center, open-label trial to assess the efficacy of quetiapine (12.5-400 mg/day) for psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Psychiatric, motor, and cognitive assessments were administered at baseline and at periodic intervals for 24 weeks. These included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and tests of intellectual functioning, attention, and memory. Repeated measures statistical analysis was used to assess change from baseline. The results revealed significant improvements in the 24-week BPRS total score and NPI psychosis subscale scores, with no decline in UPDRS total or motor subscale scores. There was also significant improvement in recall scores on cognitive measures. These results indicate that quetiapine may treat psychotic symptoms and improve cognition without worsening motor function in patients with PD, suggesting that quetiapine is an effective and well-tolerated antipsychotic in this population.
Lithium treatment has been associated with a wide range of cardiac complications. The authors report three additional cases of cardiac sinus node dysfunction due to lithium. Two of the three cases were documented to be lithium dependent by the use of Holter monitoring of cardiac rhythm. On the basis of this finding as well as other reports in the literature the authors recommend careful monitoring of the pulse of patients taking lithium as well as ECG monitoring of patients who are over the age of 50 or who have a history of cardiac disease.
The Ah receptor (AHR) mediates the metabolic adaptation to a number of planar aromatic chemicals. Essential steps in this adaptive mechanism include AHR binding of ligand in the cytosol, translocation of the receptor to the nucleus, dimerization with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator, and binding of this heterodimeric transcription factor to dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) upstream of promoters that regulate the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. The AHR is also involved in other aspects of mammalian biology, such as the toxicity of molecules like 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin as well as regulation of normal liver development. In an effort to test whether these additional AHR-mediated processes require a nuclear event, such as DRE binding, we used homologous recombination to generate mice with a mutation in the AHR nuclear localization/DRE binding domain. These Ahr(nls) mice were found to be resistant to all 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced toxic responses that we examined, including hepatomegaly, thymic involution, and cleft palate formation. Moreover, aberrations in liver development observed in these mice were identical to that observed in mice harboring a null allele at the Ahr locus. Taken in sum, these data support a model where most, if not all, of AHR-regulated biology requires nuclear localization.
Human kallikrein 10 (hK10) protein is expressed in normal breast but is significantly downregulated in a majority of invasive breast cancers. Thus, understanding how hK10 expression is regulated is of substantial significance. In this study, we analyzed the promoter region of hK10 using a website software (TRANSFAC 3.0), which predicted three possible retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), RARE1 at -1041 (TGACCTCGTGATCC), RARE2 at -859 (TGACCTCCTATGA) and RARE3 at -765 (TGACCTCCTGTGA), each with a half-site of a canonical sequence (TGACCT; reverse complement AGGTCA). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and nucleotide competition analysis, as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation of the native hK10 promoter, we demonstrated specific binding of RXR only to RARE1. The functional importance of RARE in the hK10 promoter was demonstrated by retinoid induction of hk10 promoter-reporters; furthermore, mutation of RARE1 but not of RARE2 or RARE3 abolished the induction of the reporter. Finally, we demonstrated the induction of hK10 mRNA and protein expression upon retinoid treatment of cells. In view of the correlation of the downregulation of hK10 mRNA and protein with breast cancer progression, these findings suggest a potential approach to restore hK10 expression in cancer patients.
Mood swings accompanying the motor fluctuations of patients with Parkinson's disease on chronic levodopa treatment frequently occur, but are poorly recognized. Occasionally, their functional impact may be greater than that caused by the motor disability itself. In this study we have assessed the nature of, and relationship between, mood and motor fluctuations in nine Parkinsonian patients with 'on-off' motor swings. The results of an additional questionnaire survey confirm that 'on-off' mood swings occur in approximately two thirds of patients with Parkinson's disease experiencing motor fluctuations on dopaminergic treatment. Aetiological and therapeutic implications are discussed.
We report a patient who developed an acute, reversible, generalized choreiform disorder from lithium (Li) intoxication. This medication was prescribed for manic-depressive disorder, and serum levels became elevated after the addition of a diuretic for the treatment of hypertension. There were no other apparent causes for the movement disorder, and it was associated with other known features of Li intoxication, including ataxia and encephalopathy. There was a delay between the initial symptoms of Li intoxication and the onset of chorea. The chorea improved as serum Li levels diminished, with some lag time. This represents the eleventh case report of Li-induced chorea, but only the sixth in a patient without concomitant neuroleptic therapy, and the first presented with videotape confirmation. A review of these other cases is included, and possible mechanisms are discussed.
Recent case reports and letters have alerted practitioners to the risk of sleep attacks, usually preceded by somnolence, in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole and ropinirole.
To quantify the risk of somnolence with the new dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and Cochrane Library, contacted experts and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and manually reviewed all references retrieved to identify possible articles to include. Information on randomisation, blinding, type of treatment and reporting of somnolence were abstracted by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by a third author.
We made 2 separate analyses. The first analysis compared the risk of somnolence in patients taking either pramipexole or ropinirole to that in patients taking placebo. The second analysis compared the risk of somnolence with these drugs (plus levodopa) versus that with levodopa alone. We calculated pooled relative risk estimates using the random effects model and when no heterogeneity was detected we used the fixed effects model.
Four trials were included in the analysis of patients taking pramipexole or ropinirole compared with those taking placebo. The pooled relative risk of somnolence in this analysis was 4.98 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 13.89]. Seven trials were included in the analysis of patients taking levodopa and pramipexole or ropinirole compared with those taking levodopa alone. The pooled relative risk was 2.06 (95% CI 1.47 to 2.88).
Patients with Parkinson's disease using pramipexole or ropinirole are at higher risk of experiencing somnolence relative to patients taking placebo. Patients taking levodopa plus either one of these dopamine agonists are at higher risk than those taking levodopa alone. Clinicians should carefully weigh this risk against the benefit of these agents when prescribing these drugs.
A 41-year-old woman, who was receiving methysergide maleate for the treatment of severe headaches, had occlusion of the left brachial artery, confirmed by arteriography. The occlusion was believed to result from the use of methysergide and the drug was therefore withdrawn. Within 4 days the distal pulses were normal, as confirmed by arteriography, and she was asymptomatic.
We characterized the prevalence of hematopoietic and lymphoid disease for 2923 consecutive patients presenting at 29 hospitals from August 2003 to June 2007. Diagnoses were made in our laboratory using WHO criteria based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, FISH and molecular data. A total of 611 subjects (322 males/289 females) were prospectively diagnosed with MDS using WHO (2001) criteria. Update and re-evaluation of cases using MDS (2008) criteria resulted in 649 MDS cases. Using WHO (2008) criteria, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) accounted for 68% of total cases, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 16.3%; refractory anemia (RA), 6.5%; refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD), 4%; and MDS-unclassifiable (MDS-U), 4.5%. Subjects were administered questionnaires and information on previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents such as benzene (BZ) was obtained. A total of 80/649 (13.2%) were determined to have some BZ exposure. The frequency of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in all MDS was 30%, the most common being +8>del(20)q>del(7q)>del(5q), while the analogous frequency in BZ-exposed cases was only 24%. To further investigate the characteristics of MDS associated with BZ, we identified a subset of cases with high BZ exposure. These BZ signal cases were each matched by age and gender to two cases with no known BZ exposure. When contrasting BZ signal cases vs matched cases with no BZ exposure, we found a high odds ratio (OR) for the WHO subtype MDS-U (OR=11.1), followed by RAEB and RCUD (OR=1), RA (OR=0.7) and RCMD (OR=0.6). Multilineage dysplasia with abnormal eosinophils (MDS-Eo) was strongly associated with BZ exposure, whereas the relative risk of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities was reduced for high BZ-exposed cases (OR=0.5). These findings are strongly indicative that MDS subtypes are influenced by BZ exposure, and taken together with previous studies, the features of MDS-Eo suggest that altered immune regulation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of MDS following chronic exposure to BZ.
Following isoproterenol treatment mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, phosphoslipase activity, lactate and calcium increased significantly, while activities of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, enzymes of respiratory chain and ATP production showed decline. Oxidative phosphorylation was also affected on isoproterenol treatment with significant reduction in all the variables. Fish oil pretreatment in isoproterenol treated rats showed improved mitochondrial energy metabolism. The results suggest cardioprotective effect of fish oil.
The present study was carried out to elucidate the effects of coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) against cognitive impairments induced by dichlorvos (DDVP). We have previously shown organophosphate, DDVP-induced impairments in neurobehavioral indices viz. rota rod, passive avoidance, and water maze tests. In addition to this, we have also reported that chronic DDVP exposure leads to decreased mitochondrial electron transfer activities of cytochrome oxidase along with altered mitochondrial complexes I-III activity. Administration of CoQ(10) (4.5 mg/kg, i.p. for 12 weeks prior to DDVP administration daily) to DDVP-treated rats improved cognitive performance in passive avoidance task and Morris water maze test. Furthermore, CoQ(10) treatment also reduced oxidative stress (as evident by reduced malondialdehyde, decreased ROS and increased Mn-SOD activity) in DDVP-treated rats' hippocampus region, along with enhanced activity of complexes I-III and complex IV. Electron microscope studies of rat hippocampus mitochondria revealed that CoQ(10) administration leads to near normal physiology of mitochondria with well-defined cristae compared with DDVP-treated animals where enlarged mitochondria with distorted cristae are observed. CoQ(10) administration also attenuated neuronal damage in hippocampus as evident from histopathological studies. These results demonstrate the beneficial effects of CoQ(10) against organophosphate-induced cognitive impairments and hippocampal neuronal degeneration.
Lead exposure poses a major environmental hazard in India, but little information is available on the impact of lead exposure on visuo-motor development in Indian children. We hypothesize that higher blood lead levels are associated with poorer visual-motor, visual-spatial and fine motor functioning among children. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 814 school children, aged 3-7 years. Lead in whole blood was measured using the LeadCare Analyzer. The Wide Range of Visual Motor Abilities Test (WRAVMA) was administered to each child by trained examiners. The mean blood lead level was 11.4±5.3 μg/dL. In multivariate analyses adjusting for mother's education level, father's education level, average monthly income, hemoglobin and sex, WRAVMA scores were inversely related to blood lead level. An increase of 10 μg/dL was associated with a decrease of 2.6 points (95% CI: -4.5 to -0.7, P=0.006) in the Visual Motor Composite score and a decrease of 2.9 points (95% CI: -5.1 to -0.7, P=0.011) in the Drawing subtest. Exploration of the shape of the dose-effect relationships using spline functions indicated some non-linearities, with the steepest declines in visual-motor skills occurring at higher blood lead levels. Among urban Indian children, higher blood lead levels are associated with decreased visual-motor abilities, particularly visual-motor integration.
Down-regulation of some hepatic cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) was observed in patients and animals with ulcerative colitis (UC). This study examined changes of CYP450s activities in microsomes of liver (RLMs), intestine (RIMs) and kidney (RRMs) from rats with experimental acute colitis induced by 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7days and those receiving DSS treatment followed by 7-d cessation through measuring 6α-(CYP1A1), 7α-(CYP2A1), 16α-(CYP2C11) and 2β-/6β-(CYP3A2) hydroxytestosterone (OHT) formed from testosterone. Both pro-(IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and anti-(IL-4, IL-10) inflammatory cytokines were elevated in acute colitis, while the production of the former was enhanced and that of the latter declined by DSS withdrawal. In RLMs, the CYP2A1 activity was significantly increased at DSS stimulation and partially returned to normal level when DSS treatment was terminated. Activity of other CYP450s were decreased by acute colitis and remained after DSS withdrawal. In RRMs, formations of 6α-, 16α- and 2β-OHT significantly declined in acute colitis and DSS termination further potentiated the down-regulation, while 7α-OHT formation was suppressed at DSS stimulation and remained after DSS withdrawal. The formation of 6β-OHT only showed significant decrease after DSS withdrawal. Two metabolites (6α- and 6β-OHT) formed in RIMs and 6β-OHT formation was significantly decreased by DSS stimulation and continued after DSS treatment halted. These findings indicate that the alterations of CYP450s activities vary with organ, CYP isoforms and colitis status, which arouse cautions on efficacy and toxicity of drug therapy during disease progression.
1. The hypokalaemia-inducing effects of two widely used inhaled antiasthmatic beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists, fenoterol and salbutamol, were compared in six healthy male volunteers. 2. Each drug was administered in three different doses, 400, 600 and 800 micrograms, which were repeated three times with 30 min intervals (total doses 1200, 1800 and 2400 micrograms in 1 h). The treatments were given at 1 week intervals in random order in a single-blind fashion. 3. The concentration of potassium in plasma was dose-dependently reduced by both drugs with peak effects 75-90 min after the first inhalations. The hypokalaemic effect of fenoterol was significantly greater than that of equal doses of salbutamol (average +/- s.d. reductions of 1.13 +/- 0.32 and 0.67 +/- 0.25 mEq l-1, respectively, after the highest doses, P less than 0.05). Concomitantly, decreases were noted in the amplitude of the T-wave on the ECG. 4. The concentration of cyclic AMP in plasma was measured and used as an indicator of systemic beta 2-adrenoceptor agonistic effects of the drugs. Increases in cAMP were a close mirror image of the drugs' effects on potassium in plasma. 5. Plasma renin activity, noradrenaline in plasma and heart rate were also dose-dependently increased by the treatments, whereas blood pressure remained unaltered. 6. While the clinical significance of hypokalaemia induced by inhaled beta 2-adrenoceptor sympathomimetics still is a matter of debate, our results point to possible differences between therapeutically equipotent doses of fenoterol and salbutamol in their propensity to cause hypokalaemia and other acute non-bronchial effects.
Two experiments examined the role of the sympathetic nerves in estradiol-induced fat pad weight losses in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Rats were OVX, and the retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (RWAT) was unilaterally denervated 4 wk later. After 14 days of treatment with estradiol benzoate (EB, 2 micrograms/day), the intact pads lost 23% more weight than the denervated pads. There was no effect of denervation on fat pad weight or on cytosol estrogen receptor concentration in RWAT in the animals treated with sesame oil vehicle. These data suggest that the sympathetic nerves play a role in estrogen-induced reductions in fat pad weight but not via changes in adipose tissue cytosol estrogen receptors. A second experiment examined whether estradiol-induced fat pad weight losses are accompanied by increased norepinephrine (NE) turnover, an index of sympathetic activity, in adipose tissue. Rats were OVX and treated with EB or sesame oil vehicle. NE turnover was assessed by measuring the decline of tissue NE over time after injection of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and thus NE biosynthesis. NE turnover in RWAT, but not heart, was significantly greater in animals treated with EB, suggesting that estradiol decreases fat pad weight in part by increasing sympathetic nervous system activity. It is possible that estradiol acts in the brain to regulate the activity of the sympathetic nerves to white adipose tissue and peripherally to alter adipose tissue responsiveness to catecholamines.
