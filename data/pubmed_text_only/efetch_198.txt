Infants exposed to second hand smoke (SHS) experience more problems with wheezing. This study was designed to determine if perinatal SHS exposure increases intrinsic and/or in vivo airway responsiveness to methacholine and whether potential structural/cellular alterations in the airway might explain the change in responsiveness. Pregnant rhesus monkeys were exposed to filtered air (FA) or SHS (1 mg/m(3) total suspended particulates) for 6 h/day, 5 days/week starting at 50 days gestational age. The mother/infant pairs continued the SHS exposures postnatally. At 3 months of age each infant: 1) had in vivo lung function measurements in response to inhaled methacholine, or 2) the right accessory lobe filled with agarose, precision-cut to 600 mum slices, and bathed in increasing concentrations of methacholine. The lumenal area of the central airway was determined using videomicrometry followed by fixation and histology with morphometry. In vivo tests showed that perinatal SHS increases baseline respiratory rate and decreases responsiveness to methacholine. Perinatal SHS did not alter intrinsic airway responsiveness in the bronchi. However in respiratory bronchioles, SHS exposure increased airway responsiveness at lower methacholine concentrations but decreased it at higher concentrations. Perinatal SHS did not change eosinophil profiles, epithelial volume, smooth muscle volume, or mucin volume. However it did increase the number of alveolar attachments in bronchi and respiratory bronchioles. In general, as mucin increased, airway responsiveness decreased. We conclude that perinatal SHS exposure alters in vivo and intrinsic airway responsiveness, and alveolar attachments.
Perioperative management of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is controversial because of associated hypertensive episodes during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. A 71-year-old woman with a non-functioning thyroid node was scheduled for thyroid lobectomy. Her medical history included high blood pressure and she was being chronically treated with ACEI, which were taken until the morning of surgery. After induction of anesthesia, arterial hypotension refractory to crystalloid therapy developed and worsened in spite of administration of a gelatin-type colloid (Gelafundina). The patient did not respond to ephedrine or dopamine and required stabilization with adrenalin in continuous perfusion for 12 hours. Later evolution was satisfactory and recovery took place without sequelae. We discuss the anesthetic implications of chronic ACEI treatment and possible hemodynamic repercussions of associated administration with gelatin-type solutions or human albumin.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are a rare but clinically important form of pancreatic neoplasia. To explore the genetic basis of PanNETs, we determined the exomic sequences of 10 nonfamilial PanNETs and then screened the most commonly mutated genes in 58 additional PanNETs. The most frequently mutated genes specify proteins implicated in chromatin remodeling: 44% of the tumors had somatic inactivating mutations in MEN1, which encodes menin, a component of a histone methyltransferase complex, and 43% had mutations in genes encoding either of the two subunits of a transcription/chromatin remodeling complex consisting of DAXX (death-domain-associated protein) and ATRX (Î± thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked). Clinically, mutations in the MEN1 and DAXX/ATRX genes were associated with better prognosis. We also found mutations in genes in the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway in 14% of the tumors, a finding that could potentially be used to stratify patients for treatment with mTOR inhibitors.
Bupropion is an antidepressant that has recently seen increased usage in smoking cessation. This increased usage, along with its potential for causing seizures, has renewed interest among clinicians about the effects of this drug. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical course of intentional bupropion overdoses in adults and adolescents. This study is a retrospective review of intentional bupropion overdoses reported to regional poison centers over a 2-year period. Our review included 385 cases. Women accounted for 63% of cases and ages ranged from 12 to 57 years. Significant clinical effects were noted in 26% of cases. Seizures were reported in 11% of patients. Seizures occurred within 6 h in most patients. Other prominent effects included tachycardia, agitation, and hallucinations. In conclusion, after a bupropion overdose, patients frequently display agitation, tachycardia, hallucinations and seizures. Seizures commonly occur within 6 h of the ingestion. However, seizures may occur beyond this time frame, particularly if persistent tachycardia, agitation, or hallucinations are noted.
We describe a case demonstrating reversible MR imaging findings, including diffusion-weighted imaging changes in association with metronidazole (Flagyl) toxicity. The diagnosis of metronidazole toxicity was made clinically and supported by the MR imaging findings. Quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps demonstrated edema with associated increased ADC values within the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum on initial imaging. Follow-up imaging performed 8 weeks after cessation of metronidazole therapy demonstrated resolution of imaging findings, including diffusion changes.
It has been reported that bilateral lesions of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) blocked propofol-induced amnesia of inhibitory avoidance (IA) training. Based on these results, the authors hypothesized that the amnesia effect of propofol was partly due to its impairment of memory formation in the hippocampus through activating the BLA gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor function. The authors determined the changes in activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expression to be an indicator of IA memory formation.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral injection of bicuculline methiodide (10, 50, or 100 pmol/0.5 microl) or saline (0.5 microl) into the BLA. Fifteen minutes later, the rats were intraperitoneally injected with either propofol (25 mg/kg) or saline. After 5 min, the one-trial IA training was conducted. Rats intraperitoneally infused with saline served as controls and only received saline injections into the BLA. Twenty-four hours later, the IA retention latency was tested. Separate groups of rats treated the same way were killed either 30 min after IA training for hippocampal Arc mRNA measurement or after 45 min for protein level quantification.
The largest dose of bicuculline methiodide (100 pmol) not only blocked the propofol-induced amnesia but also reversed the inhibition effect of propofol on Arc protein expression in the hippocampus (P < 0.05). However, the mRNA level of Arc showed no significant changes after propofol and bicuculline methiodide administration.
The amnesic effect of propofol seems to involve the modulation of Arc protein expression in the hippocampus, occurring through a network interaction with the BLA.
Valvular heart disease associated with the use of appetite-suppressant medication is a recently described clinical entity. Although the mechanism of valvular injury remains elusive pathologically, the valvular abnormalities resemble those observed in carcinoid syndrome. The incidence of clinically evident valvular heart disease is low with short-term (less than 3 months) exposure to appetite-suppressant drugs. Prolonged exposure to higher doses in addition to combination drug therapy confers an excess risk for valvular pathologic changes. We report the case of a patient with severe mitral regurgitation who had short-term exposure (3 weeks) to the combination of fenfluramine (20 mg) and phenteramine (15 mg).
A 52-year-old woman with bipolar disorder, rapid-cycling type, developed delirium while taking therapeutic doses of carbamazepine and neuroleptics. Her cognitive changes were attributed to a drug interaction at the CNS level.
UL-FS 49, a chemical congener of AQ-A 39 with structural similarities to verapamil, decreased the rate of spontaneously beating guinea-pig atria at much lower concentrations (effective concentration 30%, EC30 = 0.030 microgram/ml) than it decreased the contractility (2.5 Hz; EC30 = 108 micrograms/ml) and maximal driving frequency (EC30 = 11 micrograms/ml) in electrically driven atria. In comparable experiments AQ-A 39 was much less effective, the EC30 for the negative chronotropic effect being 0.61 microgram/ml. In rabbit aortic strips in the presence of 43 mM K+ and 1.8 mM Ca2+, UL-FS 49 relaxed contraction by 30% at 15 micrograms/ml. In contrast to UL-FS 49, several "Ca2+-antagonists" elicited aortic relaxation at lower concentrations than bradycardia. In anaesthetized cats (n = 6) 0.3 mg/kg i.v., UL-FS 49 increased the cardiac cycle length by 56 +/- 3.5% (S.E.), there were slight or no changes in blood pressure and ECG intervals PQ and QRS. ST and the effective refractory period (ERP), as determined by R-triggered extrastimuli in the right ventricle, were prolonged by 28 +/- 3.1% and 24 +/- 2.5% respectively. At comparable increases in cycle length AQ-A 39 prolonged ST and ERP significantly more than UL-FS 49. In isolated guinea-pig atria UL-FS 49 antagonized the carbachol-induced bradycardia; a 10-fold shift of the dose-response curve (CA10) was achieved with 11.3 micrograms/ml and the CA10 for AQ-A 39 was 1.7 micrograms/ml. In conscious dogs UL-FS 49, 1 mg/kg i.v., decreased the heart rate without changes in blood pressure. This was observed in dogs with both genuine sinus rate and heart rate elevated by either atropine or hydralazine. The bradycardic effect was positively correlated with the control heart rate. In conclusion, sinus bradycardia was the most prominent action of UL-FS 49 in isolated preparations as well as in intact animals. In comparison to its congener AQ-A 39, UL-FS 49 was more potent in lowering heart rate but less effective in prolonging repolarization time and in anticholinergic activity. It thus represents a new specific bradycardic agent.
In patients with severe heart failure additional therapeutic support with intravenous inotropic or vasodilator drugs is frequently used in the attempt to obtain hemodynamic control. The nature and extent to which diastolic filling, atrial function, and mitral regurgitation are modified by these drugs have not been fully explored. The aim of this study was to compare the acute adaptations of the left ventricular performance, left atrial function, and mitral regurgitation that accompanied hemodynamic improvement during intravenous dobutamine and nitroprusside infusions in patients with severe chronic heart failure.
Forty consecutive patients with severe heart failure were evaluated by simultaneous echo-Doppler and hemodynamic investigations at baseline and during nitroprusside and dobutamine administration. Mitral flow velocity variables, left atrial and ventricular volumes, left atrial reservoir, conduit and pump volumes, and mitral regurgitation jet area were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measurements.
Nitroprusside increased cardiac output (2.1 +/- .5 vs 2.6 +/- .5 L/min/m2, p < 0.004), reduced left ventricular filling pressure (25 +/- 6 vs 14 +/- 4 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and improved left atrial pump volume (19 +/- 3 vs 26 +/- 12 ml, p < 0.02) without variations in left atrial reservoir and conduit volume. The restoration of preload reserve and improvement of the atrial contribution to left ventricular diastolic filling were demonstrated by the Doppler mitral flow pattern, which moved from a restrictive to a normal pattern. Furthermore mitral regurgitation decreased in all patients (9 +/- 4.6 vs 4.6 +/- 3.4 cm2, p < 0.0001). Dobutamine increased cardiac output (2.1 +/- .5 vs 2.8 +/- .6 L/min/m2), but the effects on pulmonary wedge pressure and mitral regurgitation were variable and unpredictable. Left atrial reservoir and conduit volumes increased, whereas left atrial pump volume did not change (19 +/- 13 vs 22 +/- 14 ml, p = NS). Furthermore Doppler mitral flow showed a persistent restrictive pattern.
In patients with advanced congestive heart failure both nitroprusside and dobutamine improve cardiac output, with different adaptations of left ventricular performance and left atrial function. Nitroprusside seems to restore both atrial and ventricular pump function better. Careful echo-Doppler monitoring during drug infusion provides information relevant to the clinical treatment of individual patients.
Oxcarbazepine, a second generation antiepileptic drug belonging to the family of dibenz[b,f]azepines, is subjected to a rapid and extensive biotransformation. Oxcarbazepine demonstrates a low potential for drug interactions because its biotransformation is mainly mediated by the reduction pathway instead of oxidative pathways, which are very susceptible to drug interactions. The reductive metabolism of oxcarbazepine yields a 10-monohydroxy derivative (10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-carbazepine), which is responsible for the pharmacological activity. The identity and localization of enzymes participating in the reduction of oxcarbazepine in response to this active metabolite have remained unknown until now. Thus, we investigated the reductive metabolism of oxcarbazepine in human liver subcellular fractions and using recombinant carbonyl reducing enzymes. The reduction of oxcarbazepine was shown to occur largely in the liver cytosol rather than liver microsomes. Furthermore, the activity and stereospecificity of cytosolic carbonyl reducing enzymes toward oxcarbazepine were assessed. Of the eight tested enzymes, six reductases were identified to contribute to the reduction of oxcarbazepine. The highest activities were demonstrated by AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1C4. The contribution of CBR1 and CBR3 to the reduction of oxcarbazepine was also significant, although their role in oxcarbazepine metabolism in vivo is unclear.
Rifampicin is a crucial component of treatment regimens for tuberculosis and has been in use since the early 1970's. It is usually considered safe. Rarely life-threatening complications like acute renal failure or acute thrombocytopaenia may manifest during treatment with rifampicin. In our experience at the Tuberculosis Research Centre of treating more than 8000 pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients with rifampicin-containing regimens over the last 30 years, we are reporting 3 cases of probably rifampicin-induced acute renal failure. Despite extreme therapeutic safety of this drug the clinician must be aware of this rare complication, which if detected early is completely reversible.
Tacrolimus is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We report three cases of strictly sleep-associated myoclonus in RA patients treated with tacrolimus. Although the high-dosage administration of tacrolimus in transplantation is known to cause diverse neurotoxic adverse effects, including myoclonus, no previous cases of myoclonus in RA, especially in association with sleep, have been reported. We suggest that this is not a rare adverse effect, particularly in elderly RA patients.
It was established that early degeneration of motor fibers of the sciatic nerve of rats (24 and 48 hours after division) is marked by diminished activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase and activation of lipid peroxidation leading to increased accumulation of malonic dialdehyde. alpha-tocopherol acetate prevents activation of lipid peroxidation and partly suppresses the development of functional signs of degeneration (lowered amplitude of the M-response, slow restoration of the neuromuscular synapse, and decrement reaction to rhythm stimulation). OBQ2 oxidant (derivative of 4-anilino-5-methoxy-1,2-benzoquinone) had no effect on the rate of degeneration development, which is evidence of insufficiency of radical protection for realization of the anti-degeneration effect.
We used a flexibly mounted microdialysis technique to the hearts of rats and examined the protective effect of imidaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on the production of hydroxyl free radical (*OH) generation. A microdialysis probe was implanted into the left ventricular myocardium, and dialysate norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured as an index of myocardial interstitial NE levels. Sodium salicylate in Ringer's solution (0.5 nmol/microl/min) was directly infused through a microdialysis probe to detect the generation of *OH reflected by the formation of dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) in rat myocardium. When tyramine (1 mM) was directly infused through the microdialysis probe, the level of NE significantly increased in the dialysate and the level of NE increased by 128 +/- 43%. Imidaprilat (5, 25 and 50 microM) decreased the level of tyramine (1 mM)-induced NE in a concentration-dependent manner. Tyramine clearly produced an increase in *OH formation. In the presence of imidaprilat (50 microM), tyramine failed to increase both 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxylation. Therefore, the effects of imidaprilat on the *OH generation in the sympathetic nerve blockaded hearts by reserpine treatment were not observed. Moreover, to examine the effect of imidaprilat on *OH formation by ischemia/reperfusion of the myocardium, the heart was subjected to myocardial ischemia for 15 min by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. When the heart was reperfused, elevation of NE and 2,3- and 2,5-DHBA in imidaprilat (50 microM)-pretreated animals was not observed in the heart dialysate. Imidaprilat 2.5 mg/kg i.p. pretreatment at 5 h before coronary occlusion significantly blunted the rise of serum creatine phosphokinase and improved the electrocardiogram 2 h after coronary occlusion. These results suggest that imidaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, is associated with cardioprotective effect due to the suppression of NE-induced *OH generation.
Eleven of 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats given a single i.v. injection of daunorubicin (10 mg/kg) developed mammary tumors within 8 months after the injection. Four of 12 rats given an intramammary injection of daunorubicin (4 or 8 micrograms) developed five mammary tumors in the injected area within 6.5 months of injection. Tissue distribution studies using tritiated daunorubicin revealed that the liver, kidney, lung, heart, and intestine had higher daunorubicin concentrations than mammary tissue during the first 24 h after i.v. injection. However, depletion of the drug from the internal organs was more rapid than from mammary tissue. Differences in ability to metabolize daunorubicin were compared in homogenates of isolated mammary epithelial cells and hepatocytes by high-performance liquid chromatography: after 90 min, hepatocytes metabolized about 70% of daunorubicin, whereas mammary epithelial cells did not metabolize the drug. Tritiated daunorubicin injected directly into rat mammary gland showed no metabolism in 24 h, and the drug did not get into the circulation. These results suggest that retention of daunorubicin because of the inability of mammary tissue to metabolize the drug is a cause of drug-induced mammary tumors in female Sprague-Dawley rats.
Our purpose was to determine the incidence of adverse cardiovascular effects of terbutaline sulfate when administered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion in women with arrested preterm labor.
Over a 6-year period records from 8709 women prescribed this therapy for preterm labor that had previously been arrested with other intravenous tocolytics were reviewed. These women were assessed daily for cardiovascular complaints and tolerance of the medication, while either in the hospital or at the home (by telephone). The main outcomes studied were the occurrence of pulmonary edema, sustained cardiac arrhythmias, chest pain, or myocardial ischemia. Any maternal death regardless of cause was also reviewed.
Of the 8709 subjects, 47 (0.54%) had one or more cardiopulmonary problems. Pulmonary edema developed in 28 patients (0.32%) while receiving continuous subcutaneous infusion of terbutaline, 5 at home and 23 in the hospital. Of the total, 17 women were being treated concurrently with large amounts of intravenous fluids and one to three other tocolytic agents. In the 11 remaining subjects, 4 were diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension and/or multiple gestation. Nineteen patients experienced other adverse cardiovascular effects, including electrocardiogram changes, irregular heart rate, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
Continuous terbutaline infusion for women with stabilized preterm labor is associated with much fewer adverse effects than previous literature regarding intravenous beta-adrenergic agonist therapy would suggest.
Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival. However, some precautions should be taken regarding Gliadel implantation. We report three cases in whom patients with glioblastoma multiforme were implanted with fibrin glue-secured Gliadel after the lateral ventricles had been opened, and who later developed severe hydrocephalus leading to death. Although Gliadel may be an important adjunct to treatment, opening of the ventricles during surgery as part of its application should be considered a contra-indication.
A 17 year old man with transposition of the great vessels who had two episodes of late recurrent syncope following Senning repair 2 months before hospital registration. One episode required basic cardiopulmonary reanimation. Holter monitoring documented isolated polytopic and coupled ventricular extrasystoles. Programmed left ventricular pacing induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia, which converted to monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia after intravenous procainamide. A cardioverter defibrillator was implanted in left ventricle by intravenous approach. Twelve months later the patient presented an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and one appropriate therapy from the defibrillator discharge was done.
A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between a CYP1A2 inhibitor, ciprofloxacin, and clozapine was studied in schizophrenia patients with stable clozapine treatment.
A randomised double-blind cross-over study design with two phases was used. Seven schizophrenic inpatients volunteered to receive, in addition to their previous drug regimen, either 250 mg ciprofloxacin or placebo twice daily (b.i.d.) for 7 days. The phases were separated by a 7-day wash-out period. Serum concentrations of clozapine and its main metabolite N-desmethylclozapine were measured during both phases before the first dose on day 1 and on days 3 and 8.
Ciprofloxacin increased mean serum concentration of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine by 29% (P < 0.01) and 31% (P < 0.05), respectively. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) between the individual concentrations of serum ciprofloxacin and the increase in concentrations of clozapine plus N-desmethylclozapine. The increase in serum clozapine concentrations correlated significantly (r = 0.89, P < 0.01) with the ratios of N-desmethylclozapine to clozapine concentrations.
Even a low dose of ciprofloxacin can moderately increase serum concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine. A probable mechanism of interaction is an inhibition of CYP1A2 enzyme by ciprofloxacin. The possibility of clinically significant interaction should be considered, especially when higher doses of ciprofloxacin are used concomitantly with clozapine.
Drugs that decrease drug-maintained responding at doses that do not decrease other behaviors in animals may be suitable candidates for development as medications to treat drug abuse in humans. The present study examined whether this effect could be obtained with phentermine, a drug that has been reported to decrease cocaine intake in humans. Rhesus monkeys were trained under multiple fixed-ratio 30-response schedules of food and i.v. cocaine delivery. Phentermine was always given as a slow, i.v. infusion. Acute treatment with phentermine (0.3-10 mg/kg) decreased cocaine-maintained responding at doses that did not decrease, or decreased less, food-maintained responding for each of three unit doses of cocaine (10-100 microg/kg/injection). Subacute treatment with phentermine (3 or 5.6 mg/kg, daily) also decreased cocaine-maintained responding more than food-maintained responding. After subacute treatment was terminated, rates of cocaine-maintained responding generally recovered to levels comparable to those seen during untreated control sessions. Phentermine (0.3-3 mg/kg) did not generally increase responding associated with a very low (1 microg/kg/injection) unit dose of cocaine, suggesting that the decrease in cocaine-maintained responding at higher unit doses was not the result of a leftward shift in the cocaine unit dose-effect function. Phentermine (0.1-3 mg/kg) decreased responding maintained by 1-[2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl) methoxy]ethyl]-4-[3-phenylpropyl] piperazine (GBR 12909) (30 microg/kg/injection) at doses similar to those that decreased food-maintained responding. These results show that phentermine is effective in decreasing cocaine self-administration and suggest that it may be an effective medication for cocaine abuse.
