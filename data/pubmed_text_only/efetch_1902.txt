Studies in forelimb-deafferented rats suggest that treatment with certain antibiotics can decrease pain sensation. To test this hypothesis, the analgesic effects of nine randomly selected antibiotics were studied in rats by using a constant-temperature hotplate. The results show that several antibiotics have antinociceptive properties, and two of them, chloramphenicol and ampicillin, can produce analgesia in a dose range used in human therapy (100 mg/kg). This analgesia is comparable to salicylate and ketoprofen analgesia but lower than pethidine's one. The analgesia is long lasting with chloramphenicol (10 h or more). These antinociceptive properties cannot be attributed to sedation because amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, measured in an open field, is not sensitive to injection of the most sensitive antibiotics.
A 15 year old boy presented with two episodes of aseptic meningitis-like reactions after ingestion of co-trimoxazole. The diagnosis of co-trimoxazole induced aseptic meningitis was made. This syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of aseptic meningitis.
We have established Leishmania tropica as the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the region of India where the disease is endemic. The association between localized and circulating levels of immune-determinants in CL patients was evaluated. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed up-regulation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10 and IL-4 in dermal lesions at the pretreatment stage (n = 31) compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001) and a significant down-regulation after treatment (n = 14, P < 0.05). The results indicated that an unfavourable clinical outcome in CL was not related to an inadequate T helper 1 (Th1) cell response, but rather to impairment in multiple immune functions. Comparative assessment of treatment regimes with rifampicin (RFM) or sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) revealed tissue cytokine levels to be significantly reduced after treatment with RFM (P < 0.005), while no significant decrease was evident in the levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-10 (P > 0.05) as a result of treatment with SAG. Increased transcripts of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (P < 0.001) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (P < 0.05) were evident before treatment in tissue lesions and remained high after treatment. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and IL-8, and moderate expression of iNOS in dermal lesions. The expression levels of IL-8, MCP-1 and nitric oxide (NO) were high in patient sera before treatment, as determined using cytokine bead array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At the post-treatment stage, the serum IL-8 levels had decreased; however, the levels of MCP-1 and NO remained high. These data suggest that IL-8 is an effector immune-determinant in the progression of CL, whereas NO facilitates the parasite killing by macrophages via MCP-1-mediated stimulation.
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulates the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and improves motor functions in animal models of parkinsonism. Sinemet is currently the most widely used drug for treating Parkinson's disease. The present study has evaluated GDNF-Sinemet interactions in parkinsonian rhesus monkeys. Both GDNF and Sinemet, when given alone, significantly improved total parkinsonian scores. The response to Sinemet did not change after intracerebroventricular vehicle injections. In contrast, there was a functional interaction between GDNF and levodopa. When comparing the levodopa dose response before and after GDNF treatment, significant behavioral improvements were seen after trophic factor administration at every levodopa dose level except 500 mg. Adverse responses to Sinemet treatment alone in parkinsonian animals included vomiting, dykinesias, dystonias, and stereotypic movements. Combined GDNF-Sinemet treatment significantly reduced the occurrence of these levodopa-induced side effects, with a >90% decrease in adverse responses seen at the mid-Sinemet (250 mg levodopa-25 mg carbidopa) dose level. The only side effect from GDNF treatment was a transitory weight loss. Thus, combined GDNF-Sinemet treatment could be of therapeutic value in treating parkinsonism, by producing a greater functional response and by mitigating adverse responses to Sinemet treatment.
The efficiency and safety of oleanolic acid (OA) and its isomer, ursolic acid (UA) in myocardial ischemia are poorly documented. This study appraised the efficacy of OA and UA in protecting the heart against oxidative damage induced by isoproterenol, since oxidative injury has been investigated as a potential initiator of myocardial necrosis. The level of TBARS increased whereas the antioxidants decreased significantly in the myocardium of ischemic animals. The levels were brought back to near normalcy in OA and UA pre-treated rats by scavenging the free radicals and blocking the induction of lipid peroxidation. These findings provide evidence that OA and UA protect rat myocardium against ischemic insult and the protective effect could be attributed to its antioxidant property and/or to a strengthening of myocardial membrane by its membrane stabilizing action. Among the two isomeric compounds, UA showed higher activity than OA.
We postulated that combining high-dose simvastatin with bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) delivery may give better prognosis in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model.
Mouse hindlimb ischemia model was established by ligating the right femoral artery. Animals were grouped (n = 10) to receive local injection of saline without cells (control and simvastatin groups) or with 5 Ã— 106 MSCs (MSCs group). Animals received either simvastatin (20 mg/kg/d, simvastatin and combination groups) or saline(control and MSCs group) gavages for continual 21 days. The blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler imaging at day 0,10 and 21 after surgery, respectively. Ischemic muscle was harvested for immunohistological assessments and for VEGF protein detection using western blot assay at 21 days post-surgery. In vitro, MSCs viability was measured by MTT and flow cytometry following culture in serum-free medium for 24 h with or without simvastatin. Release of VEGF by MSCs incubated with different doses of simvastatin was assayed using ELISA.
Combined treatment with simvastatin and MSCs induced a significant improvement in blood reperfusion, a notable increase in capillary density, a highest level of VEGF protein and a significant decrease in muscle cell apoptosis compared with other groups. In vitro, simvastatin inhibited MSCs apoptosis and increased VEGF release by MSCs.
Combination therapy with high-dose simvastatin and bone marrow-derived MSCs would augment functional neovascularization in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia.
Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant drug that has analgesic properties for acute postoperative pain. However, the analgesic effect of gabapentin as an antiepileptic prophylactic drug on patients undergoing craniotomy is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the postoperative effectiveness of gabapentin on acute postoperative pain when it is used for antiepileptic prophylaxis in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumor resection.
Eighty patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumor resection were randomly assigned into two groups. Patients in Group G (n = 40) received oral gabapentin (3 x 400 mg), and patients in Group P (n = 40) received oral phenytoin (3 x 100 mg) for 7 days before the operation and postoperatively. An identical anesthesia protocol was performed for both the groups. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil infusion. Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine was used, and pain levels were measured. The antiepileptic-related side effects, anesthetic consumption, duration of anesthesia and surgery, tracheal extubation time, postoperative pain scores, morphine consumption, and sedation scores were recorded.
Thirty-seven patients in Group G and 38 patients in Group P completed the study. During the preoperative period in Group G, one patient had severe fatigue, one had severe dizziness, and one patient's surgical procedure was changed. The median plasma levels of gabapentin were 34 micromol/mL (range, 23-51 micromol/mL) in 34 patients. In Group P, one patient withdrew from the study preoperatively and one developed transient neurological symptoms postoperatively. The demographic data and mean duration of anesthesia and surgery were similar in both the groups. The total propofol and remifentanil consumption in Group G (1847 +/- 548 mg/3034 +/- 1334 microg) was significantly less than that of Group P (2293 +/- 580 mg/4287 +/- 1282 microg) (P = 0.01). However, tracheal extubation could be done earlier in Group P (4.5 +/- 2 min) than in Group G (16.6 +/- 22 min) (P < 0.001). Pain scores were significantly higher in Group P at 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h (P < 0.001). The total morphine consumption was also significantly higher in Group P (33 +/- 17 mg vs 24 +/- 19 mg) (P = 0.01). The postoperative sedation scores were significantly higher in Group G at 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h (P < 0.001).
The administration of gabapentin to patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumor resection was effective for acute postoperative pain. It also decreased analgesic consumption after surgery. However, it may lead to side effects such as delayed tracheal extubation and increased sedation postoperatively.
Elevated dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens is thought to be a primary mediator of addiction to cocaine. However, repeated exposure to cocaine is associated with the recruitment of glutamate transmission. This poses the possibility that the behaviors characterizing cocaine addiction, such as craving-induced relapse, may not be preferentially mediated by dopamine transmission. An animal model of relapse was used to demonstrate that glutamate, and not dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens, is a primary mediator of cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Reinstatement was produced by a systemic injection of cocaine or by the microinjection of the glutamate receptor agonist AMPA or dopamine into the nucleus accumbens. It was found that microinjection of an AMPA receptor antagonist into the nucleus accumbens blocked reinstatement by all compounds, whereas a dopamine receptor antagonist was effective only in blocking reinstatement by intra-accumbens dopamine administration. These data suggest an important role for nucleus accumbens glutamate and not dopamine transmission in cocaine-induced relapse to drug-seeking behavior.
The uricosuric drug benzbromarone (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-(2-ethyl-3-benzofuranyl)methanone, a benzofurane derivative, was studied for its effects on parameters related to hepatic peroxisome proliferation. Groups of male F-344 rats were fed either basal diet, the peroxisome proliferator clofibrate at 5000 ppm as a comparison compound, or benzbromarone at two doses, 1000 and 2000 ppm. Benzbromarone and clofibrate produced hepatomegaly and increases in the activities of catalase, acyl CoA oxidase, malate dehydrogenase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Benzbromarone and clofibrate also both induced similar histologic and ultrastructural changes in hepatocytes, including induction of peroxisomes. Therefore, benzbromarone acted as a peroxisome-proliferating agent in rats under these conditions. Benzbromarone differs from other peroxisome proliferators in its chemical structure, uricosuric action, and the morphology of liver peroxisomes that were induced by exposure.
There is increasing concern about the potential effects of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) on the developing brain. The impact of TRAP exposure on childhood behavior is not fully understood because of limited epidemiologic studies.
We explored the association between early-life exposure to TRAP using a surrogate, elemental carbon attributed to traffic (ECAT), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms at 7 years of age.
From the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) birth cohort we collected data on exposure to ECAT during infancy and behavioral scores at 7 years of age. Children enrolled in CCAAPS had at least one atopic parent and a birth residence either < 400 m or > 1,500 m from a major highway. Children were followed from infancy through 7 years of age. ECAT exposure during the first year of life was estimated based on measurements from 27 air sampling sites and land use regression modeling. Parents completed the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, 2nd Edition, when the child was 7 years of age. ADHD-related symptoms were assessed using the Hyperactivity, Attention Problems, Aggression, Conduct Problems, and Atypicality subscales.
Exposure to the highest tertile of ECAT during the child's first year of life was significantly associated with Hyperactivity T-scores in the "at risk" range at 7 years of age, after adjustment [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.7]. Stratification by maternal education revealed a stronger association in children whose mothers had higher education (aOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3, 4.1).
ECAT exposure during infancy was associated with higher Hyperactivity scores in children; this association was limited to children whose mothers had more than a high school education.
The case of a restrictive valve disease associated with cabergoline, an ergot alkaloid agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, is described. Cardiovascular and periodical follow-up assessment may be required when these drugs are prescribed.
Human response to isoproterenol induced cardiac injury was evaluated by gene and protein pathway changes in human heart slices, and compared to rat heart slices and rat heart in vivo. Isoproterenol (10 and 100Î¼M) altered human and rat heart slice markers of oxidative stress (ATP and GSH) at 24h. In this in vivo rat study (0.5mg/kg), serum troponin concentrations increased with lesion severity, minimal to mild necrosis at 24 and 48h. In the rat and the human heart, isoproterenol altered pathways for apoptosis/necrosis, stress/energy, inflammation, and remodeling/fibrosis. The rat and human heart slices were in an apoptotic phase, while the in vivo rat heart exhibited necrosis histologically and further progression of tissue remodeling. In human heart slices genes for several heat shock 70kD members were altered, indicative of stress to mitigate apoptosis. The stress response included alterations in energy utilization, fatty acid processing, and the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, a marker of increased oxidative stress in both species. Inflammation markers linked with remodeling included IL-1Î±, Il-1Î², IL-6 and TNFÎ± in both species. Tissue remodeling changes in both species included increases in the TIMP proteins, inhibitors of matrix degradation, the gene/protein of IL-4 linked with cardiac fibrosis, and the gene Ccl7 a chemokine that induces collagen synthesis, and Reg3b a growth factor for cardiac repair. This study demonstrates that the initial human heart slice response to isoproterenol cardiac injury results in apoptosis, stress/energy status, inflammation and tissue remodeling at concentrations similar to that in rat heart slices.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is teratogenic in mice, inducing cleft palate and hydronephrosis at doses which are not overtly maternally toxic or embryotoxic. After TCDD exposure the palatal shelves of normal size come into contact, but fail to fuse due to altered differentiation of the medial epithelial cells. These cells continue to express EGF receptors, proliferate, and differentiate into an oral-like stratified squamous epithelium. The present study examines the effect of TCDD on the expression of growth factors which are believed to regulate differentiation and proliferation in the palate. This study also examined the combined effect of TCDD and retinoic acid (RA), since in teratology studies coadministration of these agents results in an enhancement of cleft palate incidence. Embryos were exposed in vivo on Gestation Day (GD) 10 or 12 to TCDD ot TCDD + RA and the palatal shelves were dissected on GD 14-16. Growth factor expression was determined immunohistochemically using antibodies to TGF-alpha, EGF, TGF-beta 1, or TGF-beta 2. The growth factors displayed specific spatial and temporal expression in the palatal shelves. TCDD reduced the expression of TGF-alpha, EGF, and TGF-beta 1 in epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The degree of reduction was generally greater after exposure on GD 10 to TCDD alone or in combination with RA when compared to that on GD 12. The abnormal proliferation and differentiation of TCDD-exposed medial cells may be a response to reduced expression of EGF and TGF-alpha. Low levels of these factors may be related to the previously observed elevated levels of EGF receptors in medial cells. In other systems, low levels of ligand have resulted in upregulation of the EGF receptor. Continued proliferation and altered differentiation could also be attributable to decreased levels of TGF-beta 1, a factor inhibitory to epithelial proliferation. Since TGF-beta 1 stimulates mesenchymal growth and TGF-alpha and EGF stimulate epithelial proliferation, the formation of small shelves after exposure to TCDD + RA on GD 10 may be due to the severe reduction in these factors. Only a slight to moderate reduction in growth factor expression occurs after exposure to TCDD + RA on GD 12 and in this case shelves of normal size form. Since TCDD and RA appear to act in part through pathways that involve TGF-beta 1, in vitro experiments were designed to examine the involvement of TGF-beta 1 in TCDD teratogenicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
The present study is an effort to identify a potent chemopreventive agent against cancer, in which oxidative stress plays an important causative role. The modulatory effect of mangiferin on mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (LPO), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle key enzymes and electron transport chain complexes was investigated against lung carcinogenesis induced by benzo(a)pyrene (50 mg kg(-1) b/w orally) in Swiss albino mice. Decreased activities of electron transport chain complexes and TCA cycle key enzymes such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH), in lung cancer bearing animals were observed. Pre- and post-treatment with mangiferin (100 mg kg(-1) b/w orally) for 18 weeks, prevented the above biochemical changes, which were inclined towards normal control animal values. This study further confirms the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effect of mangiferin and these results are consistent with our hypothesis that mangiferin is a promising chemopreventive agent.
The authors evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of risperidone in 103 elderly patients (mean age, 71 years) with schizophrenia (75%) or schizoaffective disorder (25%). Using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, they conducted a prospective, open-label, 12-week trial in 14 psychiatric centers in the United States. Patients' symptoms were assessed at baseline and over a 12-week period. At endpoint, ESRS scores were significantly reduced, as were PANSS total and subscale scores. There were no clinically significant changes in electrocardiograms, laboratory test results, or vital signs. Risperidone was well tolerated and efficacious in elderly patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Through the case report of a bipolar patient treated with lithium for the past twenty years who presented a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a renal insufficiency, and a lithium intoxication. The different complications and their eventual treatment of lithium maintenance therapy are exposed and discussed.
1. The interactions between five alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents and clonidine have been studied in rats, rabbits and dogs after intracisternal injections. 2. Dibozane, ethomoxane, azapetine, dibenamine and thymoxamine reduced blood pressure in rats and an antagonism of the hypotensive effects of clonidine was detected for the first four drugs. 3. In rabbits, azapetine, dibenamine, dibozane and ethomoxane were hypotensive while thymoxamine had no effect on blood pressure. Dibozane and dibenamine reduced the hypotensive effect of clonidine. 4. In dogs, azapetine, dibozane and ethomoxane reduced blood pressure, while dibenamine induced an increase in blood pressure and thymoxamine was without effect. Only dibenamine antagonized the blood pressure lowering effect of clonidine. A definite conclusion could not be drawn with azapetine due to its long duration of action of action in both rabbits and dogs. 5. These results suggest that the central receptors involved in the hypotensive effect of clonidine differ from many other central receptors and vary according to the animal species. In addition the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents appear not to have a unique site and mechanism of action on central cardiovascular control.
Cyclophosphamide is an established bladder carcinogen, but few studies have examined the relationship between dose and effect. The largest analysis to date included only seven cases of bladder cancer. No investigation has estimated the risk of kidney cancer.
The purpose of this study was to quantify the risk of bladder and kidney cancer following cyclophosphamide therapy.
Within a cohort of 6171 two-year survivors of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 48 patients with secondary cancer of the urinary tract were identified and matched to 136 control subjects with NHL who did not develop a second malignancy. Detailed information on chemotherapeutic drugs and cumulative dose received was collected for all subjects. Radiation dose to the target organ was estimated from individual radiotherapy records. Evaluations of the risk of second cancer as a result of treatment with cyclophosphamide alone, radiation alone, or both therapies were made relative to those patients who were exposed to neither treatment modality.
A significant 4.5-fold risk of bladder cancer (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-13.6) followed therapy with cyclophosphamide, and risk was dependent upon cumulative dose. Among patients who received a total amount of cyclophosphamide of less than 20 g, a nonsignificant 2.4-fold risk of bladder cancer was apparent. Significantly elevated sixfold (95% CI = 1.3-29) and 14.5-fold (95% CI = 2.3-94) risks of bladder malignancy followed cumulative doses of 20-49 g and 50 g or more, respectively (P value for trend = .004). Radiotherapy given without cyclophosphamide was associated with a nonsignificant increased risk of bladder malignancy. Excess bladder cancer risk following treatment with both radiotherapy and cyclophosphamide was as expected if individual risks were summed. Neither radiotherapy nor cyclophosphamide was associated with excesses of kidney cancer.
Cyclophosphamide-related bladder cancer is dose dependent. For patients given cumulative doses between 20 and 49 g, the absolute risk of bladder cancer is on the order of three excess cancers per 100 NHL patients after 15 years of follow-up. At cumulative doses of 50 g or more, the excess risk increases to approximately seven excess bladder cancers per 100 NHL patients.
The strong dose-response relationship and high absolute risk of bladder cancer underscore the importance of limiting the cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide to what is required to achieve therapeutic end points. The risk of secondary bladder malignancy and other late sequelae of therapy must be carefully weighted against the curative gains provided by cyclophosphamide. Moreover, long-term side effects of therapy that might be acceptable in cancer treatment may need to be re-evaluated for patients with non-neoplastic disorders.
Exfoliation syndrome (XFS) is the most common recognizable cause of open-angle glaucoma worldwide. To better understand the etiology of XFS, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,484 cases and 1,188 controls from Japan and followed up the most significant findings in a further 6,901 cases and 20,727 controls from 17 countries across 6 continents. We discovered a genome-wide significant association between a new locus (CACNA1A rs4926244) and increased susceptibility to XFS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16, P = 3.36 Ã— 10(-11)). Although we also confirmed overwhelming association at the LOXL1 locus, the key SNP marker (LOXL1 rs4886776) demonstrated allelic reversal depending on the ancestry group (Japanese: OR(A allele) = 9.87, P = 2.13 Ã— 10(-217); non-Japanese: OR(A allele) = 0.49, P = 2.35 Ã— 10(-31)). Our findings represent the first genetic locus outside of LOXL1 surpassing genome-wide significance for XFS and provide insight into the biology and pathogenesis of the disease.
New levels of gene regulation with microRNA (miR) and gene copy number alterations (CNAs) have been identified as playing a role in various cancers. We have previously reported that sporadic breast cancer tissues exhibit significant alteration in H2AX gene copy number. However, how CNA affects gene expression and what is the role of miR, miR-24-2, known to regulate H2AX expression, in the background of the change in copy number, are not known. Further, many miRs, including miR-24-2, are implicated as playing a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis, but their specific target genes and the pathways contributing to them remain unexplored.
Changes in gene copy number and mRNA/miR expression were estimated using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays in two mammalian cell lines, MCF-7 and HeLa, and in a set of sporadic breast cancer tissues. In silico analysis was performed to find the putative target for miR-24-2. MCF-7 cells were transfected with precursor miR-24-2 oligonucleotides, and the gene expression levels of BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, MDM2, TP53, CHEK2, CYT-C, BCL-2, H2AFX and P21 were examined using TaqMan gene expression assays. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric detection using annexin V dye. A luciferase assay was performed to confirm BCL-2 as a valid cellular target of miR-24-2.
It was observed that H2AX gene expression was negatively correlated with miR-24-2 expression and not in accordance with the gene copy number status, both in cell lines and in sporadic breast tumor tissues. Further, the cells overexpressing miR-24-2 were observed to be hypersensitive to DNA damaging drugs, undergoing apoptotic cell death, suggesting the potentiating effect of mir-24-2-mediated apoptotic induction in human cancer cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. BCL-2 was identified as a novel cellular target of miR-24-2.
mir-24-2 is capable of inducing apoptosis by modulating different apoptotic pathways and targeting BCL-2, an antiapoptotic gene. The study suggests that miR-24-2 is more effective in controlling H2AX gene expression, regardless of the change in gene copy number. Further, the study indicates that combination therapy with miR-24-2 along with an anticancer drug such as cisplatin could provide a new avenue in cancer therapy for patients with tumors otherwise resistant to drugs.
There is controversy over the potential endocrine modulating influence of pesticides, particularly during sensitive phases of development. In this study, ram lambs were exposed to lindane and pentachlorophenol from conception to necropsy at 28 weeks of age. The rams (and their mothers) were given untreated feed (n = 7) or feed treated with 1 mg kg-1 body weight per day of lindane (n = 12) or pentachlorophenol (n = 5). Semen was collected from 19 weeks onwards and reproductive behaviour was tested at 26 weeks. Serum was collected every 2 weeks and at 27 weeks every 15 min for 6 h during both day and night, and for 1 h before and 5 h after stimulation with GnRH, adrenocorticotrophic hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone. The pesticides did not affect body weight and ejaculate characteristics, or cause overt toxicity. In pentachlorophenol-treated rams, scrotal circumference was increased. However, seminiferous tubule atrophy was more severe and epididymal sperm density was reduced in comparison with untreated rams at necropsy (P < 0.05). Thyroxine concentrations were lower in pentachlorophenol-treated rams than in untreated rams (P < 0.05). However, after thyroid-stimulating hormone treatment, the thyroxine response was unaltered. Reproductive behaviour was reduced in lindane-treated rams compared with control rams (P < 0.05). Serum LH and oestradiol concentrations during reproductive development, LH pulse frequency at 27 weeks and testosterone secretion after GnRH treatment were lower in lindane-treated rams than in untreated rams (P < 0.05). In summary, the effects of pentachlorophenol on the testis may be linked to a decrease in thyroxine concentrations, and reduced reproductive behaviour in lindane-treated rams may be related to decreased LH, oestradiol and testosterone concentrations.
This case report describes a generalized seizure associated with sustained-release bupropion use and sleep deprivation. The subject, a 31-year-old female smoker, was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained-release bupropion as an active control. After 5 weeks of bupropion use, the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence. The patient had no other risk factors for seizures. We suggest that sleep deprivation may add to the risk of bupropion-associated seizures.
The dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) is detoxified mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). We find that the fungicide benomyl potently and rapidly inhibits ALDH and builds up DOPAL in vivo in mouse striatum and in vitro in PC12 cells and human cultured fibroblasts and glial cells. The in vivo results resemble those noted previously with knockouts of the genes encoding ALDH1A1 and 2, a mouse model of aging-related Parkinson's disease (PD). Exposure to pesticides that inhibit ALDH may therefore increase PD risk via DOPAL buildup. This study lends support to the "catecholaldehyde hypothesis" that the autotoxic dopamine metabolite DOPAL plays a pathogenic role in PD.
Management of the behavioral complications of dementia, including agitation and aggression, presents a tremendous challenge to families and caregivers of afflicted patients. Most previous pharmacotherapies have shown minimal efficacy and significant side effects. We report our initial, open-label experience using the anticonvulsant sodium valproate in four dementia patients with severe behavioral disturbance. The drug was well tolerated by all patients, with no side effects or laboratory abnormalities, during 1- to 3-month trials. Two patients showed significant improvement in behavior, and a third had a transient response. Valproate may be a useful agent in the treatment of behavioral disturbance in dementia; controlled trials are needed to document its efficacy.
Modification of 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) multi-organ carcinogenesis by simultaneous treatment with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was studied using young and old male F344 rats. Animals, 4 or 54 weeks old, were given DMAB (s.c. injection of 50 mg/kg body wt once a week for 10 weeks) along with BHA (2.0% in diet for 11 weeks) or BHT (1.0% in diet for 11 weeks). The experiments were terminated 55 weeks after the commencement. Combined administration of BHA or BHT with the carcinogen resulted in development of urinary bladder tumors in greater than 90% of both young and old rats thus treated, whereas no tumors were induced in animals given DMAB alone. In contrast, the appearance of preneoplastic lesions in the liver and pancreas was reduced by BHA or BHT treatment. Tumor development (less than 30% incidence) was also evident in the small and large intestines, prostate, preputial glands, skin/subcutis and ear duct, with no modification by BHA or BHT. No ageing effects were evident. The formations of DMAB-DNA adducts, evaluated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical staining, correlated well with tumorigenesis in the urinary bladder, liver and pancreas. The selective enhancement of urinary bladder tumor induction by BHA and BHT appeared to be due to both increased DMAB-DNA adduct formation caused by metabolic alteration of DMAB in the liver and increased DNA synthesis in the urothelial cells.
