To evaluate the incidence of low cardiac output in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), we measured cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance at 8-48 hours of age in 30 preterm infants with RDS who were dependent on inotropic support. We then compared them to 23 normotensive preterm infants with RDS and 27 preterm infants without RDS. RDS infants had a higher cardiac output and lower systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure than infants without RDS. Infants treated with dopamine and dobutamine had a higher cardiac output and heart rate than infants on dopamine alone or the normotensive controls but a lower blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance than the normotensive controls. Supranormal cardiac output (>400 ml/min/kg) was detected in 57% of the infants in the dopamine + dobutamine subgroup (p = 0.009) versus 17% in the normotensive RDS subgroup and 12% in the dopamine subgroup. These data show that high cardiac output is relatively common in infants with RDS dependent on dopamine and dobutamine but is not reflected in the blood pressure.
The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously. Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured. Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed. Isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart. These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ST-segment. In addition, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP/O was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats. Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function. The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.
Oxygen toxicity contributes to the pathogenesis of adverse neurological outcome in survivors of preterm birth in clinical studies. In infant rodent brains, hyperoxia triggers widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration, induces pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibits growth factor signaling cascades. Since a tissue-protective effect has been observed for recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo), we hypothesized that rEpo would influence hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress in the developing rat brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of glutathione (reduced and oxidized), lipid peroxidation and the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) after hyperoxia and rEpo treatment. Six-day-old Wistar rats were exposed to 80% oxygen for 2-48 h and received 20,000 IU/kg rEpo intraperitoneally (i.p.). Sex-matched littermates kept under room air and injected with normal saline or rEpo served as controls. Treatment with rEpo significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced upregulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and malondialdehyde, a product of lipid breakdown, whereas reduced glutathione (GSH) was upregulated by rEpo. In parallel, hyperoxia-treated immature rat brains revealed rEpo-suppressible upregulation of synaptic AChE-S as well as of the stress-inducible AChE-R variant, together predicting rEpo-protected cholinergic signaling and restrained inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, treatment with rEpo induced upregulation of HO-1 on mRNA, protein and activity level in the developing rat brain. Our results suggest that rEpo generates its protective effect against oxygen toxicity by a reduction of diverse oxidative stress parameters and by limiting the stressor-inducible changes in both HO-1 and cholinergic functions.
Supplemental oxygen contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal treatment of pregnant mice (C57BL/6J) with the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1 inducer, ß-napthoflavone (BNF), will lead to attenuation of lung injury in newborns (delivered from these dams) exposed to hyperoxia by mechanisms entailing transplacental induction of hepatic and pulmonary CYP1A enzymes. Pregnant mice were administered the vehicle corn oil (CO) or BNF (40 mg/kg), i.p., once daily for 3 days on gestational days (17-19), and newborns delivered from the mothers were either maintained in room air or exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O(2)) for 1-5 days. After 3-5 days of hyperoxia, the lungs of CO-treated mice showed neutrophil infiltration, pulmonary edema, and perivascular inflammation. On the other hand, BNF-pretreated neonatal mice showed decreased susceptibility to hyperoxic lung injury. These mice displayed marked induction of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) (CYP1A1) and methoxyresorufin O-demethylase (MROD) (CYP1A2) activities, and levels of the corresponding apoproteins and mRNA levels until PND 3 in liver, while CYP1A1 expression alone was augmented in the lung. Prenatal BNF did not significantly alter gene expression of pulmonary NAD(P)H quinone reductase (NQO1). Hyperoxia for 24-72 h resulted in increased pulmonary levels of the F(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-PGF(2α), whose levels were decreased in mice prenatally exposed to BNF. In conclusion, our results suggest that prenatal BNF protects newborns against hyperoxic lung injury, presumably by detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides by CYP1A enzymes, a phenomenon that has implications for prevention of BPD in infants.
Dermal application of endosulfan to male (18.75, 37.50 and 62.50 mg/kg/day) and female (9.83, 19.66 and 32.0 mg/kg/d) rats for 30 days produced hyperexcitability, tremor, dyspnea and salivation. There were no deaths. The signs of toxicity subsided after a week. Endosulfan produced no significant changes in the organ:body weight ratio. No significant changes were seen in the histological and hematological indices. However, a significant decrease in liver GOT and GPT and serum GPT activities and a significant rise in serum alkaline phosphatase and total protein were recorded in the endosulfan-treated animals. There were no changes in LDH. Residue analysis revealed higher levels of total endosulfan in fatty tissues of rats receiving the highest dose of endosulfan.
A yeast-recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was licensed recently by the Food and Drug Administration and is now available. To assess the efficacy of the yeast-recombinant vaccine, we administered the vaccine in combination with hepatitis B immune globulin to high-risk newborns. If infants whose mothers were positive for both hepatitis B surface antigen and the e antigen receive no immunoprophylaxis, 70% to 90% become infected with the virus, and almost all become chronic carriers. Among infants in this study who received hepatitis B immune globulin at birth and three 5-micrograms doses of yeast-recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, only 4.8% became chronic carriers, a better than 90% level of protection and a rate that is comparable with that seen with immune globulin and plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine. These data suggest that, in this high-risk setting, the yeast-recombinant vaccine is as effective as the plasma-derived vaccine in preventing hepatitis B virus infection and the chronic carrier state.
A 41-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed multiple Scedosporium apiospermum brain abscesses. The infection progressed despite neurosurgical drainage and treatment with itraconazole, amphotericin B, and ketoconazole, but the brain abscesses completely resolved after treatment with posaconazole alone.
The dramatic presentation of pheochromocytoma in crisis is uncommon and is classically associated with a state of hemodynamic and sympathetic hyperactivity. The case of a 35-year-old man with an occult pheochromocytoma presenting with hypotension and cardiogenic shock shortly after beginning imipramine therapy is presented. Retrospectively, there was a history of emergency department, inpatient, and outpatient evaluation of symptoms likely to be related to an occult pheochromocytoma. He presented with hypotension refractory to fluids and inotropes and in severe respiratory distress. The early differential diagnosis was extensive including acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia with sepsis, and toxic ingestion. Shortly after admission the patient's occult pheochromocytoma was discovered and subsequently specific therapy was initiated. The patient's symptoms resolved after surgical resection of the tumor, and he was ultimately discharged without signs of congestive heart failure. The clinical pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy secondary to pheochromocytoma, and possible mechanisms of pharmacological interactions with tricyclic antidepressants are discussed.
The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide is an issue of major socio-economic concern. Diabetes mellitus is a complex and a multifarious group of disorders that disturbs the metabolism of carbohydrates, fat and protein. Medicinal plants play an important role in the management of diabetes mellitus especially in developing countries. Costus speciosus is widely used in Indian medicine to treat various diseases. Eremanthin was isolated from C. speciosus. The structure was identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Eremanthin was administered to streptozotocin (STZ) (50mg/kg bw) induced diabetic male Wistar rats at different doses (5, 10, 20mg/kg bw) for 60 days. Plasma glucose level was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in a dose dependent manner when compared to the control. In addition, oral administration of eremanthin (20mg/kg bw) significantly decreased glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol and at the same time markedly increased plasma insulin, tissue glycogen, HDL-cholesterol and serum protein. Eremanthin also restored the altered plasma enzyme (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase) levels to near normal. Results of this experimental study indicated that eremanthin possessed hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities and hence it could be used as a drug for treating diabetes.
A case of accelerated hypertension leading to renal failure in a young woman taking an oral contraceptive agent is described. During the course of her disease the left kidney was documented to decrease in size. Renal vein plasma renin activity was found to be elevated on the left in the absence of renal artery stenosis. Left nephrectomy, prompted by continuing poor blood pressure control, resulted in amelioration of the hypertension. Left renal vein thrombosis was found at surgery. It is suggested that renal vein thrombosis was a contributing factor to this patient's accelerated hypertension and may represent an unusual thrombotic complication of oral contraceptives.
Oxidative damage contributes to retinal cell death in patients with age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. One approach to treatment is to identify and eliminate the sources of oxidative damage. Another approach is to identify treatments that protect cells from multiple sources of oxidative damage. In this study, we investigated the effect of increased expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in three models of oxidative damage-induced retinal degeneration. Double transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of GDNF in the retina were exposed to paraquat, FeSO(4), or hyperoxia, all sources of oxidative damage and retinal cell death. Compared to controls, mice with increased expression of GDNF in the retina showed significant preservation of retinal function measured by electroretinograms, reduced thinning of retinal cell layers, and fewer TUNEL-positive cells indicating less retinal cell death. Mice over-expressing GDNF also showed less staining for acrolein, nitrotyrosine, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, indicating less oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. This suggests that GDNF did not act solely to allow cells to tolerate higher levels of oxidative damage before initiation of apoptosis, but also reduced damage from oxidative stress to critical macromolecules. These data suggest that gene transfer of Gdnf should be considered as a component of therapy for retinal degenerations in which oxidative damage plays a role.
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is of particular concern in women receiving tamoxifen in a chemopreventive setting. We investigate the association between acquired and inherited risk factors for VTE in the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS-I) trial of tamoxifen prophylaxis for women at increased risk of breast cancer.
We used a nested case-control study design to investigate the role of tamoxifen and acquired risk factors in the risk of developing a VTE.
Tamoxifen was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing a major VTE (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.1). Women who had surgery, immobilization, or fracture in the previous month had a greatly increased risk of developing a major VTE (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.2 to 10.1). Prothrombin and factor V Leiden mutations were found exclusively among control women: factor V Leiden in eight of 159 control women (5.0%) and the prothrombin mutation in three control women (1.9%). Thirty-five women with a VTE and a blood sample were negative for these mutations. The upper one-sided 97.5% CI for the OR of having either mutation was 1.87. Being overweight, smoking, or taking hormone replacement therapy was not associated with VTE in this study, but the CIs were wide.
Tamoxifen and prior surgery, fracture, or immobilization were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing a VTE. Factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutations were not associated with thrombosis in this population.
To investigate structural alterations of the lead triple uptake inhibitor molecule, disubstituted 4-((((3S,6S)-6-benzhydryltetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)amino)methyl)phenol, we have carried out structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to investigate the effect of alteration of aromatic substitutions and introduction of heterocyclic aromatic moieties on this molecular template. The novel compounds were tested for their affinities for the dopamine transporter (DAT), serotonin transporter (SERT), and norepinephrine transporter (NET) in the brain by measuring their potency in inhibiting the uptake of [(3)H]DA, [(3)H]5-HT, and [(3)H]NE, respectively. SAR results indicate dopamine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitory (DNRI) type activity in thiophene (10g) and pyrrole (10i) derivatives. On the other hand, 3-hydroxyphenyl derivative 10f and 4-methoxyphenyl derivative 10j exhibited a triple reuptake inhibitory (TUI) activity profile, as these molecules exhibited potent uptake inhibition for all the monoamine transporters (K(i) of 31.3, 40, 38.5 and K(i) of 15.9, 12.9, 29.3 for DAT, SERT, and NET for 10f and 10g, respectively). Compound 10f was further evaluated in the rat forced swim test to evaluate its potential antidepressant effect. The results show significant reduction of immobility by TUI 10f at 10 mg/kg dose, indicating potential antidepressant activity.
The development of targeted therapies has provided new options for the management of patients with advanced solid tumors. There has been particular interest in agents that target the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which controls tumor growth and survival and promotes angiogenesis. Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that has been proven effective as a single-agent therapy in renal cell carcinoma, and there is a strong rationale for investigating its use in combination with other agents. In particular, targeting multiple Raf isoforms with sorafenib may help to overcome resistance to other agents, while the ability of sorafenib to induce apoptosis may increase the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Based on positive results in preclinical studies, further investigation in phase I and II studies has shown potential antitumor activity when sorafenib is combined with cytotoxic agents in different solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma. Promising results have been reported in phase I and II studies of sorafenib combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin, with oxaliplatin in gastric and colorectal cancer, with docetaxel in breast cancer, with gemcitabine in ovarian cancer, and with capecitabine in different solid tumors. Phase II and III studies are currently investigating the use of sorafenib in combination with different agents in a variety of solid tumors. The primary objective of this review is to summarize the early clinical studies of sorafenib with cytotoxic agents and discuss future perspectives of these combinations in different tumor types.
In the present study, we performed an analysis of tandem of P domains in a weak inwardly rectifying K+ channel (TWIK)-related acid-sensitive K+ (TASK)-1 channel immunoreactivity in the rat hippocampal complex following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). In control animals, TASK-1 immunoreactivity was strongly detected in astrocytes in the hippocampal complex. One day after SE, TASK-1 immunoreactivity in astrocytes was markedly reduced only in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. One week after SE, loss of astrocytes was observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. At this time point, TASK-1 immunoreactive cells were detected mainly in the subgranular region. These cells had bipolar, elongated cell bodies with fusiform-shaped nuclei and showed vimentin immunoreactivity. Four weeks after SE (when spontaneous seizure developed), typical reactive astrogliosis was observed in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region. Almost no astrocytes in the molecular layer showed TASK-1 immunoreactivity, whereas astrocytes in the CA1 region showed strong TASK-1 immunoreactivity. These findings indicate that, after SE, TASK-1 immunoreactivity was differentially altered in astrocytes located in different regions of the hippocampal complex, and these changes were caused by astroglial degeneration/regeneration. Therefore, alteration in TASK-1 immunoreactivity may contribute to acquisition of the properties of the epileptic hippocampal complex.
This study examined the effects of a polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) compound, PBDE-47, on adult and larval stages of the estuarine grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio). The 96-h LC50 test resulted in an estimate of 23.60 microg/L (95% confidence interval=14.51-38.37 microg/L) for larval shrimp. Adult shrimp had a higher 96-h LC50 of 78.07 microg/L (95% CI=65.1-93.63 microg/L). Four physiological biomarkers glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPx), cholesterol (CHL) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were then assessed to study the sublethal effects of PBDE-47 exposure. GSH, LPx and AChE levels in both adults and larvae were not affected by PBDE-47 at concentrations up to 50 microg/L for 96 h. CHL levels were elevated in adults and larvae at the lowest exposure concentrations tested, but significant differences were found only in adult exposures. Effects associated with PBDE-47 aqueous exposures were observed at levels well above those reported in the environment.
The first of a series of 5HT reuptake inhibitors, zimelidine was withdrawn because of associated hypersensitivity reactions. There was concern that such reactions might be seen with other compounds of this class. Two depressed patients who had a sensitivity reaction to treatment with zimelidine were crossed over to treatment with fluoxetine and no abnormalities were observed. Both patients remained well during uneventful long term treatment with fluoxetine.
Methylprednisolone (M, 10 mg/kg/week subcutaneously) was administered to cause hypertension in rats, and the role of AV3V region was assessed before and after development of the hypertensive state. Participation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) was evaluated by changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) induced by administration of saralasin (S, 10 micron g/kg/min i.v.) or captopril (C, 20 mg/kg/p.o).aAnaAV3V lesion before M administration partially prevented and delayed the beginning appearance of M hypertension. Furthermore, a prior AV3V lesion abolished an angiotensin II (AII)-dependent pressor component normally identified by S and C administration in this type of hypertension. During the maintenance phase of the hypertension, an AV3V lesion caused a partial reduction in blood pressure. A spontaneous disappearance of a vasoconstrictor component mediated by AII was observed in the late phases of M hypertension. It is concluded that the AV3V region is essential to the full development and maintenance of M hypertension in the rat. Also in this model, integrity of the AV3V area is essential to the expression of the AII-mediated pressor component. Finally it is apparent tha M can cause hypertension even in the absence of the AV3V area or during chronic renin angiotensin blockade, indicating multiple pathogenetic mechanisms in this experimental model.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs lower the incidence of and mortality from colon cancer. In this paper, we present the effect of indomethacin on growth inhibition and alterations in the expression of several genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis in CaCo-2 colon adenocarcinoma cells.
We used the MTT test to evaluate the effect of indomethacin on the proliferation rate of colon cancer and normal fibroblast cells in vitro. The expression of c-myc oncoprotein and p53 and p27 suppressor proteins was examined using the immunocytochemical method.
We have shown that indomethacin reduces the proliferation rate of CaCo-2 colon cancer cells (up to 60% at the concentration of 4 x 10(-4) M), alters their morphology, and induces cell death by apoptosis. The most pronounced inhibitory effect was observed at the concentration of 6 x 10(-4) M where the growth was completely suppressed. However, the growth of normal fibroblasts (Hef 522) was much less inhibited (about 30% of inhibition at the concentration of 6 x 10(-4) M). Indomethacin reduces the proliferation rate and induces apoptosis in CaCo-2 colon cancer cells through enhanced expression of c-myc, p53, and p27 proteins.
This is the first report about p27-increased expression in colon carcinoma cells induced by indomethacin treatment. Increased expression of p27 represents a new mechanism of apoptosis in cells treated with NSAIDs (indomethacin). This effect probably contributes to the anti-proliferative effect on colon cancer cells in vitro.
To assess the overall risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke, associated with tamoxifen use by performing a meta-analysis of data reported in breast cancer trials.
Tamoxifen increases the risk of venous thromboembolism in women with breast cancer, but its relationship to stroke risk is uncertain.
A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of tamoxifen for breast cancer management and prevention published since 1980 was performed using MEDLINE. The summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method, followed by a statistical test for heterogeneity.
Nine trials met the inclusion criteria, and six trials specified ischemic stroke outcomes. The Mantel-Haenszel summary OR was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.41 to 2.36) for ischemic stroke and 1.40 (1.14 to 1.72) for any stroke. The chi2 heterogeneity test was 6.0 (p > 0.1) for ischemic stroke and 16.1 (p < 0.05) for any stroke. The random-effects summary OR of Der Simonian and Laird for any stroke was 1.29 (0.92 to 1.81). During a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years, the frequency of ischemic stroke was 0.71% with tamoxifen vs 0.39% for controls (absolute increased risk, 0.32%; number needed to harm [NNH], 313).
Women with breast cancer who were treated with tamoxifen had an 82% increased risk of ischemic stroke and a 29% increased risk of any stroke, but the absolute risk is small. Further studies assessing prespecified cerebrovascular outcomes are ongoing and will further clarify the risk of stroke associated with tamoxifen use.
The toxicity of 4-chloro-2-nitroaniline (4C2NA) and 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (2C4NA) was investigated on isolated rat hepatocytes following 1-3 hours of exposure to 0.2 and/or 2 mM of these xenobiotics. The higher of the two concentrations appeared to induce a statistically significant loss of cellular viability (p less than 0.01 compared to control), judged by Trypan Blue staining, after 3 hours of incubation with these substances means = 58, SD = 7%; and means = SD = 7%; for 4C2NA and 2C4NA, respectively). Furthermore, both chloronitroanilines produced an hepatocellular and microsomal damage demonstrated by conspicuous changes in LDH and G-6-Pase activities (p less than 0.01). The exposure to 2 mM of both 4C2NA and/or 2C4NA produced a marked depletion of the intracellular pool of GSH after 3 hours (13 mM/10(6) and 10 mM/10(6) cells, respectively; p less than 0.01). Thus it seems possible that 2C4NA may induce a more severe cellular damage than that induced by 4C2NA.
The long-term treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) may be complicated by the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Clinical and animal model data support the view that modulation of cannabinoid function may exert an antidyskinetic effect. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to examine the hypothesis that cannabis may have a beneficial effect on dyskinesia in PD.
A 4-week dose escalation study was performed to assess the safety and tolerability of cannabis in six PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Then a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study (RCT) was performed, in which 19 PD patients were randomized to receive oral cannabis extract followed by placebo or vice versa. Each treatment phase lasted for 4 weeks with an intervening 2-week washout phase. The primary outcome measure was a change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (items 32 to 34) dyskinesia score. Secondary outcome measures included the Rush scale, Bain scale, tablet arm drawing task, and total UPDRS score following a levodopa challenge, as well as patient-completed measures of a dyskinesia activities of daily living (ADL) scale, the PDQ-39, on-off diaries, and a range of category rating scales.
Seventeen patients completed the RCT. Cannabis was well tolerated, and had no pro- or antiparkinsonian action. There was no evidence for a treatment effect on levodopa-induced dyskinesia as assessed by the UPDRS, or any of the secondary outcome measures.
Orally administered cannabis extract resulted in no objective or subjective improvement in dyskinesias or parkinsonism.
The effect of long-term administration of digoxin on sexual dysfunction was investigated in correlation to plasma androgens level. The patients of the experimental (digoxin-treated) and control (without digoxin) groups were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients. A subjective assessment of sexual behavior was carried out, using parameters such as sexual desire, sexual excitement, and frequency of sexual relations. Personal interviews and questionnaires were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior. The findings support various reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma levels of testosterone (the difference in the mean was significant). The effect on plasma levels of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone in the experimental group as compared to the control group were not significant. Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior, showed a significant decrease in sexual desire, sexual excitement phase (erection) and frequency of sexual relations in the digoxin-treated group.
These studies aimed to outline the in vitro and in vivo histamine H(1) receptor antagonistic activity and safety pharmacology of SUN-1334H, a new potent antihistamine agent under clinical development.
In vitro antihistamine activity and selectivity of SUN-1334H was evaluated in a panel of receptor and enzyme assays and functional assays using isolated tissues. In vivo antihistamine and antiallergy efficacy were assessed following oral administration of SUN-1334H in histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs, skin wheal in beagle dogs and ovalbumin-induced rhinitis (sneezing, vascular permeability and intranasal pressure) in guinea pigs. Cardiovascular safety was assessed by CHO-K1/human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) K(+) current assay, dog telemetry and guinea-pig ECG. CNS safety was assessed by functional observational battery in rats and pentobarbital-induced sedation and pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in mice. The effect on intestinal motility was assessed in rats.
In vitro receptor binding assays showed that SUN-1334H had high histamine H(1) receptor binding affinity with an inhibition constant value of 9.7 nmol/L and either no or insignificant affinity with a panel of receptors and enzymes. In functional assays, SUN-1334H caused potent inhibition of histamine-induced contractions of isolated guinea-pig ileum with an IC(50) (half the maximal inhibitory concentration) of 0.198 micromol/L. In contrast, SUN-1334H had no significant effect on isolated tissue contractions induced by cholinergic, H(2)-histaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic receptor agonists or BaCl(2). In studies of animal models of histamine-mediated disorders, SUN-1334H potently inhibited histamine-induced bronchospasm over 24 hours following oral administration and completely suppressed histamine-induced skin wheal in beagle dogs and ovalbumin-induced rhinitis in guinea pigs. In CHO-K1/hERG cells, SUN-1334H did not modulate hERG K(+)-currents at concentrations as high as 100 micromol/L. Cardiovascular and CNS function and intestinal motility were not altered at doses several-fold greater than those required for efficacy, indicating a good safety profile of the drug.
SUN-1334H is a potent, orally active, highly selective H(1) receptor antagonist with a long duration of action in its preclinical profile. It has potential for the treatment of disorders involving histamine as a mediator.
A randomized trial was performed to investigate the ability of the nucleoside transport inhibitor dipyridamole (DP) to enhance the antitumor activity of fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (folinic acid [FA]).
One hundred eighty-one untreated patients with advanced colorectal cancer were randomized to receive 5-FU 600 mg/m2 plus FA 300 mg/m2 on days 2 to 4 with or without DP 75 mg orally three times daily on days 1 to 5. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. Only patients with documented tumor progression before therapy were eligible. 5-FU pharmacokinetics using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were assessed in 11 nonrandomized patients receiving paired cycles with or without DP.
One hundred seventy-four patients were assessable for toxicity and response. There was no significant difference in toxicity, except DP-related headache in 24% of patients. An objective response rate of 15% (one complete response [CR] and 13 partial responses [PRs]) for 5-FU/FA and 13% (two CRs and nine PRs) for 5-FU/FA/DP was observed. The dose-intensity of 5-FU delivered was significantly higher (1.09- to 1.16-fold) for the DP-containing arm. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 5-FU did not differ significantly, except for a prolonged half-life (t1/2) induced by DP. The median time to progression (P = .8) and the median survival time (11.6 months for 5-FU/FA v 9.3 months for 5-FU/FA/DP; P = .14, log-rank test) were not different between treatment arms.
Orally administered DP did not improve the antineoplastic activity of 5-FU/FA in patients with advanced colorectal cancer when used at this dose and schedule. The observed increase in 5-FU dose-intensity for FU/FA/DP was not clinically relevant.
We report about the sudden onset of a median nerve neuropathy in an anticoagulated patient eight weeks after uneventful carpal tunnel release. Several differential diagnosis have to be considered: compression syndrome as well as iatrogenic damage of the median nerve due to the preliminary procedure or even concomitant disease can generate symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. We diagnosed an intraneural haematoma through surgical exploration. This rare complication of oral anticoagulation therapy occurred spontaneously and was treated successfully by interfascicular neurolysis.
The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of drug therapy on weight loss, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores, and binge eating patterns (BES) between obese binge eaters and non-binge eaters.
22 severe binge eaters, 17 moderate binge eaters, and 16 non-binge eaters received phentermine resin 15mg/day and dl-fenfluramine 20mg three times daily over a 6 month period for weight loss. All data are reported as mean+/-S.
The percent weight loss compared to baseline within the 3 groups ranged from 8.9% to 11.3% at 3 months and 10.6% to 14.9% at 6 months. After 6 months, 73% of the severe binge eaters, 59% of moderate binge eaters and 69% of non-binge eaters had experienced more than 10% weight loss. BDI scores were significantly higher in the severe group at baseline when compared to non-binge eaters (p<0.006). After 3 and 6 months BDI scores improved in all groups but remained significantly different between the severe and non-binge eaters until the 6-month assessment. BES scores declined in all groups over the 6-month period. Echocardiograms were performed in 35 of 55 subjects following reports of a possible association between fenfluramine and valvular changes. Fifteen (43%) of subjects had no abnormal findings and 20 (57%) had evidence of valvular insufficiency occurring in one or more valves. Seven patients (20%) had significant valve damage according to the DHHS and FDA criteria.
After 24 weeks of treatment severe binge eaters improved their eating pattern, depression scores, and achieved weight loss similar to non-binge eaters.
