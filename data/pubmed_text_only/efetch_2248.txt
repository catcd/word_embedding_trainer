Allergic reactions to macrolides appear to be very rare. Only a few cases of fixed drug eruption or urticaria due to the administration of erythromycin have been reported. Cross-reaction between the different macrolides have not yet been published. We report a case of a 31-year-old female patient who developed generalized urticaria and tachycardia shortly after administration of roxithromycin (Rulid). Immediate-type hypersensitivity was confirmed by positive prick test reactions to roxithromycin and the chemically closely related macrolides erythromycin and clarithromycin.
Although the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, is synthesized exclusively by kidney tissue, severe hypercalcemia developed in an anephric child treated with large doses of vitamin D. Treatment by calcium-free peritoneal dialysis acutely reduced serum calcium from 17.2 to 14.2 mg/100 ml. This decrement was effected by removal of three times the total calcium in extracellular fluid, suggesting enhanced bone resorption. Oral prednisolone for 7 days reduced serum calcium to 13 mg/100 ml, but hypercalcemia recurred rapidly after prednisolone was stopped. Calcitonin, given for only 4 one-half days, produced normocalcemia. Maximum serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), observed immediately after vitamin D was stopped, was 635 ng/ml (normal range 23-32 ng/ml) and subsequently decreased with an initial half-time of 10 days. Losses in peritoneal dialysate may have contributed to disappearance of serum 25-OHD. Because of the high serum levels of 25-OHD and absence of renal tissue, 25-OHD was the likely metabolite that caused hypercalcemia, probably by stimulation of bone resorption, though contribution to hypercalcemia by another vitamin D metabolite cannot be absolutely excluded.
To evaluate the effect of 0.5% apraclonidine on intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil size, and heart rate in clinically normal dogs.
Randomized masked saline-controlled case study.
Nine clinically normal conditioned adult dogs of either sex.
Normal diurnal variation in IOP, pupil size, and resting heart rate were determined from 7 AM to 7 PM (day 1). These measurements were repeated on day 2 after topical application of 60 microliters of 0.5% apraclonidine to 1 randomly chosen eye of each dog. The contralateral eye received saline solution.
Compared with the saline-treated fellow eye, mean IOP in the apraclonidine-treated eye was significantly reduced (3.0 mm of Hg, 16%) 8 hours after treatment. Because of mild day-to-day variations in IOP, however, IOP in the apraclonidine-treated eye on day 2 was not significantly different from day-1 baseline values obtained from the same eye. Significant mydriasis (2.1 mm, 29.7%), persisting for up to 8 hours, occurred in apraclonidine-treated eyes. Although apraclonidine did not significantly alter heart rate when all 9 dogs were viewed as a group, 4 dogs experienced a 9 to 19.5% reduction in heart rate 2 hours after treatment. Mild blanching of the conjunctiva occurred in apraclonidine-treated eyes.
Apraclonidine lowered IOP and, in contrast to cats where it causes miosis, induced mydriasis in dogs. Although heart rate generally is unchanged, it may be reduced in select individuals.
Topically applied 0.5% apraclonidine may be a useful adjunct to other antiglaucoma treatment modalities in dogs, but is unlikely to be effective as the sole agent in most forms of canine glaucoma.
In starvation, glycerol is released from adipose tissue and serves as an important precursor for hepatic gluconeogenesis. By unknown sex-specific mechanisms, women suppress the endogenous glucose production better than men and respond to metabolic stress with higher plasma glycerol levels. Hepatic glycerol uptake is facilitated by aquaporin-9 (AQP9), a broad-selectivity neutral solute channel, and represents an insulin-regulated step in supplying gluconeogenesis with glycerol. In the present study, hepatic AQP9 abundance was increased 2.6-fold in starved male rats as assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. By contrast, starvation had no significant effect on hepatic AQP9 expression in female rats. Coordinately, plasma glycerol levels remained unchanged with starvation in male rats, whereas it was increased in female rats. The different responses to starvation were paralleled by higher glycerol permeability in basolateral hepatocyte membranes from starved male rats compared with starved females. Ovariectomy led to a starvation-response pattern identical to that observed in male rats with increased hepatic AQP9 expression and unchanged plasma glycerol levels. In cultured hepatocytes, 17β-estradiol and the selective estrogen receptor α-agonist, propyl pyrazole triol, caused a decrease in AQP9 expression. Our results support that a sex-specific regulation of the hepatic glycerol channel AQP9 during starvation contributes to the higher plasma glycerol levels observed in women during fasting and possibly results in a lower cytosolic availability of glycerol. Furthermore, the sexual dimorphism in the hepatic handling of glycerol during starvation might be explained by 17β-estradiol preventing the starvation-induced increase in hepatic AQP9 abundance.
Experimental evidence suggests that selective CB2 receptor modulators may provide access to antihyperalgesic agents devoid of psychotropic effects. Taking advantage of previous findings on structure-activity/selectivity relationships for a class of 4-quinolone-3-carboxamides, further structural modifications of the heterocyclic scaffold were explored, leading to the discovery of the 8-methoxy derivative 4a endowed with the highest affinity and selectivity ever reported for a CB2 ligand. The compound, evaluated in vivo in the formalin test, behaved as an inverse agonist by reducing at a dose of 6 mg/kg the second phase of the formalin-induced nocifensive response in mice.
The administration of high doses of methamphetamine causes long lasting damage to central dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons through a mechanism known to involve presynaptic, cytoplasmic stores of those transmitters and thought to be dependent upon a free radical reaction. The following studies were designed to determine if differential inhibition of the subtypes of monoamine oxidase would alter the magnitude of the methamphetamine induced neuronal damage. In addition, since monoamine oxidase type B increases with age, the effects of high dose administration of methamphetamine were evaluated in senescent mice. It was observed that inhibition of monoamine oxidase type A, and to a lesser degree, type B, increased the magnitude of methamphetamine-induced neuronal damage and that aged mice were more sensitive to the toxic action of methamphetamine. These results are interpreted with respect to the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), a strategy used to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury, consists of brief ischemic periods, each followed by reperfusion, prior to a sustained ischemic insult. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects of hind limb IPC in male Wistar rat (200-250 g) models of acute inflammation. IPC was induced with right hind limb ischemia for 10 min by placing an elastic rubber band tourniquet on the proximal part of the limb followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Groups (N = 6-8) were submitted to right or left paw edema (PE) with carrageenan (100 microg) or Dextran (200 microg), hemorrhagic cystitis with ifosfamide (200 mg/kg, ip) or gastric injury (GI) with indomethacin (20 mg/kg, vo). Controls received similar treatments, without IPC (Sham-IPC). PE is reported as variation of paw volume (mL), vesical edema (VE) as vesical wet weight (mg), vascular permeability (VP) with Evans blue extravasation (microg), GI with the gastric lesion index (GLI; total length of all erosions, mm), and neutrophil migration (NM) from myeloperoxidase activity. The statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined by ANOVA, followed by the Tukey test. Carrageenan or Dextran-induced PE and VP in either paw were reduced by IPC (42-58.7%). IPC inhibited VE (38.8%) and VP (54%) in ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. GI and NM induced by indomethacin were inhibited by IPC (GLI: 90.3%; NM: 64%). This study shows for the first time that IPC produces local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects in models of acute inflammation other than ischemia-reperfusion injury.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of four different Japanese and Chinese herbal prescriptions, Ren-Shen-Yang-Rong-Tang (Ninjin'yoeito, NYT), Chai-Hu-Gui-Zhi-Gan-Jiang-Tang (Saikokeishikankyoto, SKKT), Si-Jun-Zi-Tang (Shikunshito, SKT) and Si-Wu-Tang (Shimotsuto, SMT), which are traditionally used for anemia and fatigue, against hematotoxicity in mice treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). NYT 1-100 mg kg(-1) day(-1) injected orally for 7 consecutive days before and after 5-FU injection significantly suppressed reductions in red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet counts in peripheral blood, and accelerated their recovery. Administration of SKKT also produced a slight but significant improvement in 5-FU-induced erythrocytopenia, whereas SMT and SKT could not prevent anemia. Oral injection of NYT also inhibited 5-FU-induced decreases in peripheral reticulocyte and bone marrow cell counts on day 10, and markedly hastened their recovery on day 20, in a dose-dependent manner. Erythroid progenitor colonies, such as colony forming units-erythroid and burst forming units-erythroid, formed by marrow cells from mice treated with 5-FU were significantly increased by oral administration of NYT. These findings suggest that NYT has the potential to protect against hematotoxicity, and also has hematopoietic activity, through stimulation of immature erythroid progenitor cell differentiation.
Melamine-formaldehyde resin (MFR) is used as a textile finish, in tableware, in surface coatings, and in glues in the furniture and wood industry. MFR is considered to be an infrequent sensitizer. Contact allergy to MFR is often combined with formaldehyde allergy. Patients allergic to textile finish often react to MFR, although other finishes are nowadays more commonly used. Besides allergy to textile finish, allergic contact dermatitis from MFR has been described in workers in composite production and in an orthopaedic plaster technician. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports of contact allergy in the plywood industry from MFR. We describe 3 cases of occupational allergic contact dermatitis from MFR without contact allergy to formaldehyde, 1 in the plywood industry, 1 in the production of melamine-laminated chipboard and 1 in laboratory work.
The combined effects of various carcinogens found in food products are a concern for human health. In the present study, the effects of flumequine (FL) on the in vivo mutagenicity of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) in the liver were investigated. Additionally, we attempted to clarify the underlying mechanisms through comprehensive gene analysis using a cDNA microarray. Male gpt delta mice were fed a diet of 0.03 % MeIQx, 0.4 % FL, or 0.03 % MeIQx + 0.4 % FL for 13 weeks. The effects of cotreatment with phenobarbital (PB) were also examined. Treatment with MeIQx alone increased gpt and Spi(-) mutant frequencies, and cotreatment with FL, but not with PB, further exacerbated these effects, despite the lack of in vivo genotoxicity in mice treated with FL alone. FL caused an increase in Cyp1a2 mRNA levels and a decrease in Ugt1b1 mRNA levels, suggesting that the enhancing effects of FL may be due in part to modification of MeIQx metabolism by FL. Moreover, FL induced an increase in hepatocyte proliferation accompanied by hepatocellular injury. Increases in the mRNA levels of genes encoding cytokines derived from Kupffer cells, such as Il1b and Tnf, and cell cycle-related genes, such as Ccnd1 and Ccne1, suggested that FL treatment increases compensatory cell proliferation. Thus, the present study clearly demonstrated the combined effects of 2 different types of carcinogens known as contaminants in foods.
A striking cutaneous eruption developed in a fifty-eight year old woman with bipolar affective disorder three weeks after starting carbamazepine therapy. She had an infectious mononucleosis-like systemic illness associated with myriads of cutaneous micropustules, erythroderma and a high eosinophil count. A similar eruption due to carbamazepine has been reported only twice before, but isolated cases ascribed to other medications exist. We believe that this reaction is a specific class of drug eruption best named Toxic Pustuloderma.
Lung cancer has a high mortality rate and is often diagnosed at the metastatic stage. Recently, gefitinib, a molecule target therapeutic drug, has offered a new approach for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This report describes the effects of gefitinib on bone metastases in two patients with NSCLC. The pain induced by a bone metastasis was relieved after the administration of gefitinib. Furthermore, the radiographs and CT findings showed sclerotic changes that matched those of the metastatic bone tumor after gefitinib administration in both patients. It is believed that gefitinib inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced normal bone formation. In patients with NSCLC, gefitinib may be effective in the treatment of bone metastases.
This study was performed to investigate the effect of tetrahydroisoxazolopyridine (THIP), a GABAA agonist, on the morphine-induced hyperactivity, reverse tolerance and postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity in mice. A single administration of morphine induced hyperactivity in mice. However, the morphine-induced hyperactivity was inhibited dose-dependently by the administration of THIP (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg, i.p.). In contrast, daily administration of morphine resulted in a reverse tolerance to the hyperactivity caused by morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.). THIP inhibited the development of reverse tolerance in the mice that had received the repeated same morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) doses. The postsynaptic dopamine receptor super-sensitivity, which was evidenced by the enhanced ambulatory activity after the administration of apomorphine (2 mg/kg, s.c.), also developed in the reverse tolerant mice. THIP also inhibited the development of the postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity induced by the chronic morphine administration. These results suggest that the hyperactivity, reverse tolerance and postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity induced by morphine can be inhibited activating the GABAA receptors.
The acute hepatotoxicity of isomers of dichlorobenzene (o-, m-, and p-DCB) was compared in livers of male B6C3F1 mice at different time points after a single intragastric administration. The highest doses of o-, m-, and p-DCB administered, 300, 300, and 1800 mg/kg, respectively, are below the lethal range. Acute hepatic injury was assessed by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and hepatic histology. Hepatocyte replication was estimated by means of immunohistochemical demonstration of BrdU-labeled cells. Both o-DCB and m-DCB at a dose of 300 mg/kg produced significant elevations of liver weight and ALT activity as well as extensive liver cell necrosis. In contrast, p-DCB at a highest dose of 1800 mg/kg induced slight hepatocyte injury. Dose-response studies indicated that the rank order for acute hepatotoxicity of the isomers was m-DCB > o-DCB > or = p-DCB. However, p-DCB induced hepatocyte cell proliferation in spite of the lack of manifest hepatotoxicity. In contrast, increases of cell proliferation due to o- or m-DCB exposure occurred only after dosages that caused hepatic injury. These data suggest the hepatocyte proliferation induced by o- or m-DCB is compensatory regeneration while that induced by p-DCB is a response to mitogenic stimulation.
Retinoids are signaling molecules that are involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during development. Retinoids exert their effects, in part, by binding to nuclear receptors, thereby altering gene expression. Clinical use of retinoids in the treatment of neuroblastoma is of interest due to their success in management of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Using the SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell line we investigated the effects of the differentiation agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an enzyme previously shown to enhance differentiation in vitro. Manganese superoxide dismutase mRNA, protein, and activity levels increased in a time-dependent manner upon treatment with ATRA. Nuclear levels of the NF-kappaB proteins p50 and p65 increased within 24 h of ATRA administration. This increase paralleled the degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaB-beta. Furthermore an increase in DNA binding to a NF-kappaB element occurred within a 342-bp enhancer (I2E) of the SOD2 gene with 10 microM ATRA treatment. Reporter analysis showed that ATRA-mediated I2E-dependent luciferase expression was attenuated upon mutation of the NF-kappaB element, suggesting a contribution of this transcription factor to retinoid-mediated upregulation of MnSOD. This study identifies SOD2 as a retinoid-responsive gene and demonstrates activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in response to ATRA treatment of SK-N-SH cells. These results suggest that signaling events involving NF-kappaB and SOD2 may contribute to the effects of retinoids used in cancer therapy.
The present study investigated the effect of the organophosphate, dichlorvos (DDVP), on ocular function and cholinesterase activity in guinea pigs, using a single-animal-head-only vapor exposure system. All animals exhibited signs of mild organophosphate poisoning (e.g., salivation, chewing, lacrimation, urination, defecation, and rhinorrhea) after the 20-min exposure, regardless of the DDVP exposure concentration (e.g., 35 mg/m(3), 55 mg/m(3), and 75 mg/m(3)). Pupil constriction or miosis was the most pronounced effect seen after vapor exposure. The postexposure pupil size for the 35 mg/m(3) group was 45.8 +/- 3.68% of the preexposure baseline measurement. Postexposure pupil size in the 55- (38 +/- 1.36%) and 75 mg/m(3) (38.1 +/- 1.72%) groups was significantly less than both the preexposure baseline level and the 35 mg/m(3) group. All groups exhibited enhanced an pupillary response to light after DDVP exposure. The enhanced light response remained even after recovery from miosis (approximately 1 h after exposure). Measurement of cholinesterase activity revealed that even though pupil size had recovered, acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase remained significantly inhibited in the blood.
We report the case of a mentally retarded 30 y.o. patient with partial trisomy of chromosome 9, affected by epilepsy. Following treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), the patient developed several rare complications: after beginning therapy with phenytoin, the patient developed pseudolymphoma; after monotherapy with carbamazepine (CBZ), the patient thereafter developed myoclonic jerks of upper and lower limbs upon awakening; after one year of treatment with valproate (VPA) the patient developed clinical and immuno-haematological signs of SLE. Gradual withdrawal of AED, obtained clinical remission. The possibility that the chromosomal abnormality of the patient was responsible for the three rare complications observed during AED therapy is considered.
The effect of drug-induced convulsions on subsequent cortical kindling was studied in male Long-Evans rats. Animals experienced three intravenous infusions of physiological saline at 3 day intervals, or three convulsions induced by the infusion of cocaine or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Beginning eight days after the last infusion, all animals were kindled by stimulation of the anterior neocortex (area 6). PTZ-induced convulsions facilitated the development of both the behavioral convulsion and the electrographic seizure during cortical kindling, while cocaine-induced convulsions facilitated only the development of the electrographic seizure. Comparison of these results with previous research indicates that convulsions induced by these two drugs have long-lasting effects on brain function which differ both in their anatomical distribution and in the nature of the effects produced. These drugs also differed in their acute effects at subconvulsant doses on the expression of cortically kindled seizures. Cocaine (and lidocaine, another local anesthetic) substantially elevated afterdischarge (AD) threshold and inhibited the focal component of the cortically kindled seizure. PTZ had no significant effect on either of these variables but significantly increased AD duration. In addition to these drug effects, a substantial inhibitory effect on seizure expression was observed, both during kindling and afterwards, when ADs were elicited daily but not when they were separated by 3 days or more. This finding suggests that the large number of ADs typically required for cortical kindling may be due in part to daily stimulation.
Ivermectin, a substrate of multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, has been used successfully in the treatment of onchocerciasis in Ghana. However, there have been reports of suboptimal response in some patients after repeated treatment. Polymorphisms in host MDR1 and CYP3A genes may explain the observed suboptimal response to ivermectin. We genotyped relevant functional polymorphisms of MDR1 and CYP3A in a random sample of healthy Ghanaians and compared the data with that of ivermectin-treated patients with a view to exploring the relationship between suboptimal response to ivermectin and MDR1 and CYP3A allelic frequencies.
Using PCR-RFLP, relevant polymorphic alleles of MDR1 and CYP3A4 genes were analysed in 204 randomly selected individuals and in 42 ivermectin treated patients.
We recorded significantly higher MDR1 (3435T) variant allele frequency in suboptimal responders (21%) than in patients who responded to treatment (12%) or the random population sample (11%). CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6 alleles were detected at varied frequencies for the sampled Ghanaian population, responders and suboptimal responders to ivermectin. CYP3A5*1/CYP3A5*1 and CYP3A5*1/CYP3A5*3 genotypes were also found to be significantly different for responders and suboptimal responders. Haplotype (*1/*1/*3/*1) was determined to be significantly different between responders and suboptimal responders indicating a possible role of these haplotypes in treatment response with ivermectin.
A profile of pharmacogenetically relevant variants for MDR1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes has been generated for a random population of 204 Ghanaians to address the scarcity of data within indigenous African populations. In 42 patients treated with ivermectin, difference in MDR1 variant allele frequency was observed between suboptimal responders and responders.
The administration of MPA to virgin female BALB/c mice led to the development of mammary adenocarcinomas, which in further in vivo transplants gave rise to both MPA-dependent and MPA-independent lines. In this paper we chose one of the MPA-dependent lines with high contents of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, and were able to demonstrate that a) the growth of these tumors could be manipulated by the administration or the withdrawal of the hormonal supply; b) PR were down-regulated in MPA-treated mice; c) progesterone had the same stimulatory effect as MPA on tumor growth; d) tumors did not grow in estrogen-treated mice; e) tumor growth was much lower in males than in females; f) the presence of the ovaries had a positive influence on tumor growth, even in the presence of MPA; g) the withdrawal of progestin pellets in ovariectomized mice usually led to complete remissions followed by regrowth of the tumors after several weeks; and h) the regrowing tumors maintained their steroid receptor pattern and (in 3 out of 4 cases) their hormone-dependent behavior in further passages.
LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus induces immune dysfunction leading to B cell leukemia and murine AIDS with cytokine dsyregulation. Theophylline induces apoptosis of leukemia cells in humans. Therefore the effects of theophylline on immune dysfunction in a murine model of leukemia were investigated. C57BL/6 mice consumed drinking water containing 0.3% theophylline beginning 2 weeks after murine retrovirus infection for 4 months. Theophylline largely prevented the retrovirus induced splenomagaly, lymphodenopathy, reduction in B and T cell proliferation, and suppression of Thl cytokines (IL-2) secretion. It also suppressed Th2 cytokine (IL-4, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) production, which was otherwise stimulated by retrovirus infection. These data suggest that immune dysfunction, induced by murine retrovirus infection, was largely prevented by theophylline treatment.
A potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A receptor inverse agonist and antagonist, ACP-103 [N-(4-fluorophenylmethyl)-N-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N'-(4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl) carbamide (2R,3R)-dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1, active:salt)], was evaluated for its ability to reduce the primary motor symptom of tremor using tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements in rats, which is an animal model of parkinsonian tremor. Furthermore, ACP-103 was evaluated for its ability to reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesias in monkeys rendered parkinsonian with MPTP [1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine]. ACP-103 reduced tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements in rats. In addition, ACP-103 administered in combination with levodopa caused a dose-related reduction in dyskinesias in monkeys. These data suggest that ACP-103 may have the potential to reduce tremor and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.
Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of nimesulide and paracetamol in subjects with cutaneous, respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nimesulide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well-documented history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema. Furthermore, we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to paracetamol and nimesulide. A single-placebo-controlled oral challenge procedure with nimesulide or paracetamol was applied to 829 patients with a history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema. A total of 75/829 (9.4%) patients experienced reactions to nimesulide or paracetamol. Of the 715 patients tested with nimesulide 62 (8.6%) showed a positive test, while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with paracetamol, 13 (9.6%) did not tolerate this drug. Furthermore, 18.28% of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11.8% of subjects with an history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema or angioedema alone (with or without chronic urticaria) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs. Taken together, our results confirm the good tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria/angioedema caused by NSAIDs. However, the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic urticaria and, above all, by a history of NSAID-induced angioedema.
Recent studies have demonstrated that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonists decrease alcohol self-administration and suggest that the anti-craving medication, acamprosate, may also act to decrease mGluR5 function. To address the role of mGluR5 in behavioural actions of ethanol and acamprosate, we compared mutant mice with deletion of the mGluR5 gene and mice treated with a mGluR5 antagonist (MPEP) or acamprosate. Lack of mGluR5 or administration of MPEP reduced the severity of alcohol-induced withdrawal (AW), increased the sedative effect of alcohol (duration of loss of righting reflex; LORR), and increased basal motor activity. The motor stimulation produced by ethanol was blocked by deletion of mGluR5, but not by injection of MPEP. Both acamprosate and MPEP increased ethanol-induced LORR and reduced AW. Importantly, the protective effects of both MPEP and acamprosate on AW were found when the drugs were injected before, but not after, injection of ethanol. This indicates that the drugs prevented development of dependence rather than merely producing an anticonvulsant action. No effects of acamprosate or MPEP on ethanol-induced LORR and AW were found in mGluR5 knockout mice, demonstrating that mGluR5 is required for these actions. mGluR5 null mutant mice showed decreased alcohol consumption in some, but not all, tests. These data show the importance of mGluR5 for several actions of alcohol and support the hypothesis that some effects of acamprosate require mGluR5 signalling.
Tenofovir-containing antiviral therapy might result in acute renal failure and is able to induce tubular dysfunction with hypocalcemia. On the other hand, hypercalcemia induced by intoxication with colecalciferol has been described to induce renal failure in HIV-positive individuals as well. Here, the authors describe the unusual case of reversible renal failure due to hypercalcemia in a patient with low-dose colecalciferol substitution treated with tenofovir.
A 31-year-old HIV-positive female, CDC stage C3, was admitted to the authors' hospital with progressive renal failure and hypercalcemia. Antiretroviral therapy consisted of tenofovir and emtricitabine in combination with efavirenz. Additionally, she was on low-dose vitamin D(3) substitution (25 microg/d) and calcium supplementation (500 mg/d) due to systemic steroid treatment.
Additionally to regular control of renal function, serologic level of calcium should be supervised in patients concomitantly treated with tenofovir and colecalciferol.
The effect of vitamin E on dieldrin-induced hepatic focal lesion growth in male B6C3F1 mice previously treated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was investigated. After hepatic focal lesions were formed, mice were placed into one of the following treatment groups: Group 1, 50 mg vitamin E/kg diet (control NIH-07 diet); Group 2, 10 mg dieldrin/kg NIH-07 diet; Group 3, 10 mg dieldrin and 450 mg vitamin E/kg NIH-07 diet; and Group 4, 450 mg vitamin E/kg NIH-07 diet. Mice were killed and necropsied after 30 and 60 d of dietary treatment. The effect of treatment on lesion growth was examined by measuring the number of focal lesions per liver and the relative hepatic focal lesion volume. In addition, the possible cellular mechanism of focal hepatocyte growth was investigated by examining both focal DNA synthesis and apoptosis. Dieldrin treatment alone (Group 2) increased the focal lesion volume, focal lesion number, and focal lesion labeling index. Supplementation with vitamin E (Group 3) blocked this effect. Vitamin E supplementation to the diet alone (Group 4) also enhanced focal lesion growth and increased the number of lesions per liver, the relative focal volume, and the labeling index in hepatic focal lesions. Interestingly, vitamin E supplementation inhibited apoptosis in normal liver but did not produce an observable decrease in apoptosis in hepatic focal lesions. The present study showed that dieldrin (Group 2) or vitamin E supplementation alone (Group 4) promoted the growth of hepatic focal lesions in mice. However, when vitamin E is supplemented to dieldrin-fed mice (Group 3), there is an inhibition of hepatic focal lesion growth.
This study was carried out to clarify the effect of the combination of acute hypervolaemic haemodilution and hypotensive anaesthesia induced with sevoflurane on human middle cerebral artery flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography.
Thirty patients who were maintained with N2O-O2-sevoflurane anaesthesia undergoing hip surgery were randomly divided into two groups (no controlled hypotension group, Group A, and controlled hypotension group, Group B). Haemodilution was produced by acute preoperative infusion of 1000 mL of hydroxyethylstarch without removing blood in both groups. Mean arterial pressure was maintained at approximately 95 mmHg in Group A and at 55 mmHg for 80 min by increasing the inspired concentration of sevoflurane in Group B. Middle cerebral artery flow velocity was measured before haemodilution, after haemodilution, 80 min after starting hypotension, and 60 min after recovery from hypotension.
Middle cerebral artery flow velocity significantly increased in both groups after haemodilution; by 28%, in Group A, P < 0.05 vs. before haemodilution and by 30% vs. before haemodilution in Group B, P < 0.05). During controlled hypotension, it decreased towards the pre-haemodilution value (P < 0.05 vs. after haemodilution).
Sevoflurane-induced hypotension to a mean arterial pressure of 55 mmHg would reduce middle cerebral artery flow that had been increased by acute hypervolaemic haemodilution, such as haematocrit value of 26%, whereas it could preserve the flow in pre-haemodilution condition during normocapnia.
