Midodrine, a prodrug, is converted after oral administration into its active drug, desglymidodrine, which acts as an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor stimulant. Midodrine is prescribed for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in patients with spinal cord injury. By virtue of its alpha(1)-adrenergic effects, midodrine causes an increase in the tone of the vesical sphincter, which may silently lead to progressive retention of urine, particularly in patients with spinal cord injury who void urine spontaneously. Further, midodrine may aggravate detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, which can lead to hydroureteronephrosis. A 68-year-old man with C-4 tetraplegia was voiding urine satisfactorily through reflex detrusor contractions. He was prescribed midodrine (5 mg at 8:00 AM, 5 mg at 1:00 PM, and 2.5 mg at 10:00 PM) for postural hypotension. During the next 7 wk, this patient experienced severe leg spasms while passing urine, and the flow of urine became very slow. Intravenous urography showed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, although an earlier study had revealed normal kidneys. Midodrine therapy was stopped, and intermittent catheterization 4 times a day, along with oral oxybutynin, was started. After midodrine was discontinued, the leg spasms during passage of urine and slowing of the urine stream coincident with the spasms disappeared completely. The patient was able to pursue activities of daily living without taking midodrine. A 40-year-old man with C-7 tetraplegia was passing urine spontaneously with no problem. For postural hypotension, he was prescribed midodrine (5 mg in the morning and 2.5 mg at lunchtime), fludrocortisone (100 microg daily), and ephedrine (15 mg by mouth, taken 10 min before getting up in the morning). Three months later, the patient presented with sweating. During the day, he would pass only small amounts of urine, but from evening onward, he would void large volumes of urine, and the sweating would diminish. Intravenous urography showed vesical diverticula; a postmicturition film revealed moderate residual urine. This patient was able to stop taking the second dose of midodrine, but he required midodrine and ephedrine in the morning to enable him to get up without feeling dizzy. After the noon midodrine dose was stopped, the patient's sweating diminished by late afternoon. During the morning hours, however, he continued to sweat and had difficulty passing urine. Intermittent catheterization was not possible in the community setting, and the patient remains under close follow-up. These cases illustrate that patients with cervical spinal cord injury who void spontaneously may develop insidious urologic adverse effects after taking midodrine for postural hypotension. When patients with spinal cord injury develop urologic adverse effects while taking midodrine, the drug should be stopped, and other pharmacologic agents (eg, fludrocortisone) and nonpharmacologic methods should be prescribed for management of orthostatic hypotension. If a patient continues to require midodrine to control postural hypotension, intermittent catheterization combined with antimuscarinic therapy (eg, oxybutynin) should be recommended instead of spontaneous voiding.
Two severely disabled children with epilepsy, a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, had been treated with valproic acid from the ages of 5 and 6 months, respectively, and developed Fanconi syndrome. Both patients were bedridden and fed by means of a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube. Because their Fanconi syndrome appeared to be caused by valproic acid, that treatment was stopped; for both patients, the Fanconi syndrome then resolved, in 6 months and 3 months, respectively. Severely handicapped children may be at risk for valproic acid-induced renal involvement. Although renal involvement is an uncommon adverse effect of valproic acid, Fanconi syndrome due to valproic acid therapy has rarely been reported. In the few previous cases, the patients, who were bedridden and fed through a nasogastric or a gastrostomy tube, had taken valproic acid for an average of approximately 7 years. Nonetheless, their valproic acid blood levels were normal. Urinary abnormalities disappeared in an average of 4 months, as also in the present two cases. The potential for Fanconi syndrome must be considered in children with epilepsy who are treated with valproic acid, especially in severely disabled children.
alpha 1-Adrenoceptor function and plasma catecholamine levels were investigated in chronically hemodialyzed patients with and without hemodialysis-induced hypotension. In the interdialytic period blood pressure responses as well as the mydriasis after topical application of the alpha 1-selective agonist phenylephrine were not significantly different in patients with or without hypotension during dialysis, although patients with hypotension were more susceptible to miosis induced by the muscarinergic agonist carbachol. In the normotensive group the blood pressure increasing effect of phenylephrine was attentuated after 120 min of hemodialysis therapy. Plasma noradrenaline levels were not significantly different in both groups and did not change significantly during hemodialysis, while plasma dopamine was significantly increased in the hypotensives. Thus, evidence for a pathophysiological role of a postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor dysfunction in hemodialysis-induced hypotension was lacking.
Many authors described the effects on the fetus of maternal cocaine abuse during pregnancy. Vasoconstriction appears to be the common mechanism of action leading to a wide range of fetal anomalies. We report on an infant with multiple cranial-nerve involvement attributable to brainstem dysgenesis, born to a cocaine-addicted mother.
Dobutamine echocardiography was performed on 297 patients after acute myocardial infarction to assess the prognostic value of dobutamine-induced hypotension in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients were divided into two groups according to ejection fraction (group I, ejection fraction <0.45, n = 123; group II, ejection fraction > or =0.45, n = 174) and were followed for 20+/-8 months. Hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure > or =20 mm Hg, compared with baseline values. The incidence of hypotension was similar in groups I and II (23.6% vs. 18.4%, P = 0.28), and the hypotension was not related to positive dobutamine echocardiography. Univariate analysis showed that the development of hypotension was associated with a higher incidence of cardiac death in group I but not in group II. Multivariate analysis showed that dobutamine-induced hypotension was an independent predictor only for cardiac death in group I and was not related to any other cardiac events in either group. In conclusion, the development of hypotension during dobutamine stress can identify a subgroup with poor ventricular functional reserve and at high risk for cardiac death among patients complicated with left ventricular dysfunction.
Medication with anticholinergic properties are used commonly in family practice. Toxic delirium, which may resemble an acute psychosis, can occur as an adverse drug reaction to properly prescribed anticholingeric medication and to recommended doses of many patent medicines. More frequently it is due to overdosage. The key to diagnosis is the presence of peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade. Delirium induced by anticholinergic drugs can be treated rapidly and effectively with physostigmine salicylate.
Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic drug. Although there is evidence that it might be more effective in combination with chemotherapy the exact mechanism of action is unclear. Therefore, we investigated its effect in combination with metronomically applied cisplatin in a xenotransplant mouse model characteristic for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, its possible synergistic action in vitro, and which tumor-derived factors might be targeted by thalidomide. Although thalidomide alone was ineffective, a combined treatment with low-dose cisplatin inhibited significant tumor growth, proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo as well as migration and tube formation of endothelial cells in vitro. Noteworthy, the latter effect was enhanced after coapplication of cisplatin in nontoxic doses. An inhibitory effect on tumor cell migration was also observed suggesting a direct antitumor effect. Although thalidomide alone did not influence cell proliferation, it augmented antiproliferative response after cisplatin application emphasizing the idea of a potentiated effect when both drugs are combined. Furthermore, we could show that antiangiogenic effects of thalidomide are related to tumor-cell derived factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and Il-8 some known and with, granulocyte colony stimulating growth factor and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating growth factor, some new target molecules of thalidomide. Altogether, our findings reveal new insights into thalidomide-mediated antitumor and antiangiogenic effects and its interaction with cytostatic drugs.
The death of a patient from cardiopulmonary arrest after the administration of magnesium sulphate for imminent eclampsia is reported. It has long been recognized that magnesium sulphate provides rapid control of convulsions in eclamptic patients with minimal sedative effects on both mother and fetus. However, because of the neuromuscular blocking action of magnesium and the narrow margin between therapeutic and toxic serum levels, the drug must be given with caution. A regimen for magnesium sulphate administration is advocated which allows safe and effective control of convulsions in eclampsia.
Cadmium (Cd), a toxic metal that induces apoptosis and necrosis in a variety of cells, accumulates in pancreas and may be a cause of diabetes in humans. In the insulinoma cells line HIT-T15 (HIT), we measured internal calcium (Ca) and Cd levels by the fluorescent dye Fura-2 and confirm that L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) play a major role in glucose response and represent a pathway of Cd influx in these cells. Therefore we examined the role of VDCC in acute Cd poisoning by comparing its accumulation and cytotoxic effect in HIT cells and in epithelial-like VDCC-free HeLa cells. Cultures were incubated with 10-300 microM Cd for 15 min-6 h. While negligible at the end of the treatment, HIT cell death was evident after 18-24 h, and it was time-, dose- and serum-dependent. Short (< or = 60 min) Cd treatments with lower doses (< or = 100 microM in serum-free medium) induced delayed apoptotic cell death, as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation on agarose gels and segmentation of DAPI-stained nuclei. Longer incubations and/or higher concentrations caused mainly necrosis. The same treatments were largely harmless in HeLa cells, in which neither death nor DNA fragmentation was observed. The Ca antagonist nimodipine was capable to prevent HIT cell death at lower doses of Cd and to restore the apoptotic condition at higher doses, indicating that reduction of Cd flux through VDCC modulates Cd toxicity. These data demonstrate a specific sensitivity to Cd of insulinoma cells that can be significant for pancreatic beta-cell pathology.
Arsenic exposure from burning coal with high arsenic contents occurs in southwest Guizhou, China. Coal in this region contains extremely high concentrations of inorganic arsenic. Arsenic exposure from coal-burning is much higher than exposure from arsenic-contaminated water in other areas of China. The current status and prevention strategies for arsenic poisoning from burning high-arsenic coal in southwest Guizhou, China, is reported here. Over 3,000 arsenic-intoxicated patients were diagnosed based on skin lesions and urinary arsenic excretion. Non-cancerous toxicities and malignancies were much more common and severe in these patients than in other arsenic-affected populations around the world. The high incidence of cancer and arsenic-related mortality in this cohort is alarming. Chelation therapy was performed but the long-term therapeutic effects are not satisfactory. The best prevention strategy is to eliminate arsenic exposure. Funds from the Chinese Government are currently available to solve this arsenic exposure problem. Strategies include the installation of vented stoves, the use of marsh gas to replace coal, health education, the improvement of nutritional status, and the use of various therapies to treat arsenic-induced skin and liver diseases.
A study was made of whether the administration of magnesium or ethmozin to conscious dogs with normal plasma Mg levels (0.75 +/- 0.06 mmol/l) terminates ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia, an arrhythmia which is dependent on triggered activity resulting from delayed afterdepolarizations. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced by programmed ventricular pacing during the continuous iv. infusion of ouabain to animals with a formaldehyde-induced permanent complete AV block. A single dose of MgSO4 (100 mg/kg b.w. iv.) abolished only those ventricular tachycardias with cycle lengths > 325 ms (inverse use-dependency); ventricular tachycardias with cycle lengths < 320 ms were merely slowed, despite the fact that the increase in plasma Mg levels was considerable and comparable in both groups (3.9 +/- 1.6 and 4.8 +/- 1.9 mmol/l). In contrast, ethmozin (2 mg/kg b.w. iv.) terminated both fast and slow ventricular tachycardias. It is concluded that ethmozin (moricizine) is more effective than the traditionally used MgSO4 in terminating ventricular tachycardia resulting from cardiac glycoside toxicity.
Selective pulmonary vasodilation is an advantageous method for testing the responsiveness of the pulmonary vasculature of heart transplant candidates. A pilot study was under-taken to test the hypothesis that inhaled aerosolized milrinone may cause selective pulmonary vasodilation.
18 consecutive male heart transplant candidates with either dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy were included in this open clinical study. Nine of the patients had significant pulmonary hypertension with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure > 30 mmHg. After baseline measurements, 2 mg of milrinone was administered by ultrasonic nebulization. Pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics were measured ten, 30, and 60 min after inhalation.
After inhalation for ten minutes, milrinone induced a significant reduction of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (32.7 +/- 9.1 vs 37.7 +/- 7.5 mmHg, P = 0.01), pulmonary vascular resistance index (296 +/- 150 vs 396 +/- 151 dyn.sec(-1).cm(-5).m(2), P = 0.02) and transpulmonary gradient (10.6 +/- 5.5 vs 15 +/- 4.9, P = 0.01) only in patients with significant pulmonary hypertension. There was no significant effect on mean arterial pressure or systemic vascular resistance at any time after inhalation in either group. Furthermore, there was no influence on extravascular lung water or intrathoracic blood volume.
We conclude that inhaled aerosolized milrinone for a short period selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature in heart transplant candidates with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, without producing systemic side effects. Further comparative studies are necessary to evaluate possible advantages of milrinone compared to other inhaled vasodilators.
Trichloroethylene (TCE)-induced liver toxicity and carcinogenesis is believed to be mediated in part by activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). However, the contribution of the two TCE metabolites, dichloroacetate (DCA) and trichloroacetate (TCA) to the toxicity of TCE, remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the metabolite profiles in serum and urine upon exposure of mice to TCE, to aid in determining the metabolic response to TCE exposure and the contribution of DCA and TCA to TCE toxicity. C57BL/6 mice were administered TCE, TCA, or DCA, and urine and serum subjected to ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS)-based global metabolomics analysis. The ions were identified through searching metabolomics databases and by comparison with authentic standards, and quantitated using multiple reactions monitoring. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of mRNA, biochemical analysis, and liver histology were also performed. TCE exposure resulted in a decrease in urine of metabolites involved in fatty acid metabolism, resulting from altered expression of PPARα target genes. TCE treatment also induced altered phospholipid homeostasis in serum, as revealed by increased serum lysophosphatidylcholine 18:0 and 18:1, and phosphatidylcholine metabolites. TCA administration revealed similar metabolite profiles in urine and serum upon TCE exposure, which correlated with a more robust induction of PPARα target gene expression associated with TCA than DCA treatment. These data show the metabolic response to TCE exposure and demonstrate that TCA is the major contributor to TCE-induced metabolite alterations observed in urine and serum.
Organic cation transporters (OCT1-3 and OCTN1/2) facilitate cardiac uptake of endogenous compounds and numerous drugs. Genetic variants of OCTN2, for example, reduce uptake of carnitine, leading to heart failure. Whether expression and function of OCTs and OCTNs are altered by disease has not been explored in detail. We therefore studied cardiac expression, heart failure-dependent regulation, and affinity to cardiovascular drugs of these transporters. Cardiac transporter mRNA levels were OCTN2>OCT3>OCTN1>OCT1 (OCT2 was not detected). Proteins were localized in vascular structures (OCT3/OCTN2/OCTN1) and cardiomyocytes (OCT1/OCTN1). Functional studies revealed a specific drug-interaction profile with pronounced inhibition of OCT1 function, for example, carvedilol [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀), 1.4 μmol/L], diltiazem (IC₅₀, 1.7 μmol/L), or propafenone (IC₅₀, 1.0 μmol/L). With use of the cardiomyopathy model of coxsackievirus-infected mice, Octn2mRNA expression was significantly reduced (56% of controls, 8 days after infection). Accordingly, in endomyocardial biopsy specimens OCTN2 expression was significantly reduced in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas the expression of OCT1-3 and OCTN1 was not affected. For OCTN2 we observed a significant correlation between expression and left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001) and the presence of cardiac CD3⁺ T cells (r = -0.45, P < 0.05), respectively. OCT1, OCT3, OCTN1, and OCTN2 are expressed in the human heart and interact with cardiovascular drugs. OCTN2 expression is selectively reduced in dilated cardiomyopathy patients and predicts the impairment of cardiac function.
Postpartum congestive heart failure developed in a primigravida seven years after doxorubicin therapy for osteosarcoma. Delayed cardiac toxicity may be affected by preeclampsia, anemia, or postoperative fluid management.
The effect of a single intravesical dose of N-Methyl-N-Nitrosourea (MNU) on bladder carcinogenesis in Fischer rats by a suprathreshold dose of N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl] formamide (FANFT) was studied. Animals were sacrificed periodically during the course of the study and the experiment was terminated 50 weeks. Carcinomas were first noted in the MNU + FANFT group at 35 weeks versus 37 weeks for the group receiving FANFT alone. At 50 weeks, carcinomas were seen in 40 of 49 animals in the MNU + FANFT group and in 40 of 48 animals in the FANFT group. Of the animals developing bladder carcinomas 50 per cent receiving MNU + FANFT and 32 per cent receiving FANFT had high grade tumors. Six per cent of the animals receiving MNU alone developed bladder carcinomas whereas none was seen in a control group. In this system, the addition of an inducing dose of MNU did not alter the induction rate or results of carcinogenesis by FANFT. There was a tendency for higher grade tumors in those animals receiving the inducing dose of MNU.
Respiratory function is the main cause of mortality in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Elevated levels of TGF-β play a key role in the pathophysiology of DMD. To determine whether therapeutic attenuation of TGF-β signaling improves respiratory function, mdx mice were treated from 2 weeks of age to 2 months or 9 months of age with either 1D11 (a neutralizing antibody to all three isoforms of TGF-β), losartan (an angiotensin receptor antagonist), or a combination of the two agents. Respiratory function was measured in nonanesthetized mice by plethysmography. The 9-month-old mdx mice had elevated Penh values and decreased breathing frequency, due primarily to decreased inspiratory flow rate. All treatments normalized Penh values and increased peak inspiratory flow, leading to decreased inspiration times and breathing frequency. Additionally, forelimb grip strength was improved after 1D11 treatment at both 2 and 9 months of age, whereas, losartan improved grip strength only at 2 months. Decreased serum creatine kinase levels (significant improvement for all groups), increased diaphragm muscle fiber density, and decreased hydroxyproline levels (significant improvement for 1D11 only) also suggested improved muscle function after treatment. For all endpoints, 1D11 was equivalent or superior to losartan; coadministration of the two agents was not superior to 1D11 alone. In conclusion, TGF-β antagonism may be a useful therapeutic approach for treating DMD patients.
The well-documented difference in pentobarbital withdrawal severity between DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice offers the opportunity to study how differences between allelic variants influence pentobarbital withdrawal via their additive and/or dominance effects and to identify modifier loci that also influence the trait via gene-gene interactions (a form of epistasis). Previous work in our laboratory identified seven provisional quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for pentobarbital withdrawal using BXD recombinant inbred strains. To date, only one of these QTLs has been confirmed, Pbw1. We hypothesized that other loci that act epistatically may also influence genetic variance in pentobarbital withdrawal severity. Using Epistat, a program developed to carry out full-genome searches for epistasis, we identified six provisional epistatic interactions (p < .002) between the provisional QTLs and modifier loci elsewhere in the genome. Verification testing of these interactions using 404 B6D2F2 mice provided supporting evidence that a QTL on chromosome 11 contributes to genetic variance in pentobarbital withdrawal, but only in the presence of a modifier allele on distal chromosome 1 (p = .0004). This modifier is in the same genomic vicinity as loci detected for a variety of withdrawal and seizure phenotypes.
Three patients were initially seen with headache, blurred vision, and papilledema while taking lithium carbonate for their respective bipolar affective disorder. A diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was made in each case when a thorough evaluation revealed only elevated intracranial pressure. Two of the patients had complete resolution of their symptoms and papilledema after discontinuing use of the drug. Increased intracranial pressure with papilledema persisted in the third patient when she failed to adjust psychiatrically, necessitating continuance of the lithium carbonate therapy. A history of lithium carbonate ingestion should be sought in patients with the syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri. All patients receiving this drug should have a regular funduscopic examination.
Warfarin is involved in the majority of fatal adverse drug events in Norway. The aim of this study is to identify risk factors behind the haemorrhagic complications.
We analysed all adverse event reports involving bleeding related to warfarin that were received by the Norwegian Medicines Agency from 1990 to 2000.
713 reports were included; 71% of the patients were above 70 years of age. The most frequent diagnosis was atrial fibrillation (39%). Cerebral bleedings were reported in 57% of the cases, 73% of which were fatal, as were 39 % of gastrointestinal bleedings and 14% of other bleedings. International normalised ratio values (INR values) at the time of bleeding were reported in 83% of the cases; mean INR value was 4.4 (range 1.2 - > 8.0). INR values above recommended limits at the time of bleeding were found in 74% of the patients. In 63%, bleedings occurred during the first month; in 30% during the first five days. Median duration of treatment was shorter in fatal (16 days) than in non-fatal cases (24 days).
Our results show that haemorrhagic complications are associated with high INR values and initiation of treatment. Simple strategies for reducing bleedings include better monitoring of patients, careful dose adjustment, and INR values in the lower end of the recommended ranges.
Thirteen-week toxicity studies of the flame retardant 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol (BMP; dibromoneopentyl glycol; FR-1138; CAS No. 329690-0) were conducted in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. The chemical was administered by oral gavage in corn oil 5 days per week for 13 weeks to rats at doses of 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg and to mice at doses of 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, or in the feed for 13 weeks at concentrations of 0, 1250, 2500, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 ppm for rats and at 0, 625, 1250, 2500, 5000, and 10,000 ppm for mice. There was a dose-related decrease in body weight gain in rats and mice after chemical administration. Mortality attributed to toxicity of BMP was seen in the gavage study in 2/10 high-dose (800 mg/kg) male rats and 3/10 high-dose (400 mg/kg) male mice no dose-related mortality occurred in the feed study. Minimal degeneration in the renal papilla was seen in male rats at 800 mg/kg in the gavage study and at doses of 5000 ppm or more in the feed study. This was also present in one female rat at the 20,000 ppm dose. In male mice renal papillary necrosis occurred at 400 mg/kg after dosing by the gavage route and at 2500, 5000, and 10,000 ppm in the dosed-feed study. In female mice papillary necrosis occurred only at the 10,000 ppm dose in the feed study. Tubular cell regeneration of the renal cortex was also present in mice at the same dose levels at which the papillary necrosis was observed. Transitional cell hypeplasia of the urinary bladder was seen in male rats at 400 and 800 mg/kg and in both sexes of mice at 200 and 400 mg/kg. Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was also seen when BMP was administered in the feed at doses of 20,000 ppm to male rats; at doses of 2500, 5000, and 10,000 ppm to male mice; and at doses of 5000 and 10,000 ppm to female mice. The kidney and urinary bladder are target organs when BMP is administered by gavage or the dosed-feed route; mice were more sensitive than rats for the development of kidney and bladder lesions. Male rats and mice were more sensitive than females for the development of renal papillary degeneration or necrosis.
We report a case of acute encephalopathy in a patient with Crohn's disease who had taken sulfasalazine for 1 month. The development of toxic hepatitis and dermatitis prompted interruption of the drug. Four days later, neurologic symptoms became evident. These included acute monoparesis of the left arm, the development of stupor and coma, with endorotation of both arms, and a left Babinski sign. CT and MR imaging revealed multiple lesions in the white and gray brain matter, suggesting diffuse cerebral microangiitis. All cerebrospinal fluid examinations were negative. Methylprednisolone was given intravenously. Complete clinical normalization followed. Neurotoxicity secondary to sulfasalazine has seldom been reported in the literature. We found certain similarities with two previous case reports suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine or one of its metabolites. For ethical reasons, no rechallenge was performed.
A 16-year-old male suffering from Ewing's sarcoma of the pelvis was treated with vincristine as part of his chemotherapeutic protocol. The boy was never known to suffer from any neurological problems. His father had a mild limp, attributed to prolonged "taxi driving," that was never investigated medically. The first course of treatment, which included 2 mg of vincristine, resulted in clinical improvement. However, at the same time the patient developed severe weakness of both upper and lower limbs, areflexia, and gradually a pes cavus deformity. Nerve conduction studies were suggestive of severe peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, axonal and demyelinative. A definite diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth was confirmed by molecular analysis showing the typical duplication of 1.5 megabases at 17 p11.2. This unique manifestation of vincristine neurotoxicity is reported and discussed.
