To determine whether down-regulation of transcription factor signaling during pregnancy disrupts the induction of efflux transporters in type I diabetic mice.
Type I diabetes was induced in female C57BL/6 mice with multiple low dose intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ) at least 2 weeks prior to mating with normoglycemic male mice. On gestation day 14, livers were collected from vehicle- and STZ-treated non-pregnant and pregnant mice for quantification of efflux transporter and transcription factor signaling.
STZ treatment up-regulated expression of Mrp1-5, Mdr1, Abcg5, Abcg8, Bcrp, and Bsep mRNA and/or protein in the livers of non-pregnant mice. Interestingly, little to no change in transporter expression was observed in STZ-treated pregnant mice compared to vehicle- and STZ-treated non-pregnant mice.
This study demonstrates the opposing regulation of hepatobiliary efflux transporters in response to diabetes and pregnancy and points to PPARÎ³, Nrf2, and FXR as candidate pathways underlying the differential expression of transporters.
Results obtained in recent experiments suggest that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) engraft into tissues and differentiate into various somatic cell types. However, it is unclear whether injury is required for the phenomenon to occur at appreciable frequencies. In this study we tested whether BMDCs engraft into kidneys and differentiate into renal cells in the absence or presence of toxic injury. Renal damage was induced by delivery of folic acid (FA) to bone marrow (BM)-recipient mice 1 or 9 months after bone marrow transplant, and kidneys were examined for donor-derived cells 2,4, or 8 weeks after injury. Donor-derived cells were abundant in the renal interstitium of injured kidneys and were detected in glomeruli of vehicle- and FA-treated mice. Most of these cells expressed the common leukocyte antigen CD45 and display morphological characteristics of white blood cells. No donor-derived renal tubule cells (RTCs) were detected in kidney sections of BM-recipient mice. However, in cell culture, a cluster of seven donor-derived cells of 4 x 10(6) RTCs examined (approximately 0.0002%) displayed morphological characteristics of RTCs. CD45+ cells of donor origin were also detected in glomeruli and glomerular outgrowths. Nested polymerase chain reaction analysis for the male-specific Sry gene in cultured RTCs and glomerular outgrowths confirmed the presence of donor-derived cells. These results suggest that BMDCs may incorporate into glomeruli as specialized glomerular mesangial cells; however, BMDCs rarely contribute to the repair of renal tubules in uninjured or FA-treated mouse kidneys.
Lenalidomide is an important contemporary treatment option for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Rare instances of autoimmune conditions have been observed in association with its use. Although moderate myelosuppression is not uncommonly seen in patients treated with lenalidomide, aplastic anemia has not previously been reported to be associated with this agent. We describe a case of severe aplastic anemia (AA) that was probably induced by lenalidomide. A 64-year-old male patient developed progressive pancytopenia three weeks into therapy with lenalidomide for his relapsed MM. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of AA and suggested the existence of an immunological reaction at the level of marrow. A gradual spontaneous recovery of normal hematopoiesis followed after the lenalidomide discontinuation.
At the time of the study no information was available in France about the incidence of Reye's Syndrome (RS) and no warnings about RS and aspirin. The objective was to evaluate the incidence of RS in France by a hospital-based study. For a period of 1 year from November 1995 to November 1996, all French paediatric departments were required to report any child under 15 years with unexplained noninflammatory encephalopathy (i.e., CDC consciousness level stage I or deeper with normal CSF) and a threefold (or greater) increase in serum aminotransferase and/or ammonia. All suspected cases were classified by a panel of experts as probable RS or excluded RS. In 10% of randomly selected paediatric departments we checked that every suspected case had been reported. Forty-six suspected cases were reported during the year of the survey, of which 14 were classified as RS. Five of these 14 cases had a metabolic disorder. Nine children were definitively diagnosed as having RS (i.e., an estimated incidence of RS of 0.79/1,000,000 children, i.e., below 15/year). Eight children had been exposed to aspirin, four to aspirin alone and four to aspirin and acetaminophen. On the basis of these results the incidence of RS in France in 1996-1997 was not substantially different from that of countries where warning labels were already in use, but it was higher than in the US after 1994. This was probably due to the reduction in aspirin prescription in France because of warnings in Europe and the US and also because many cases of RS are now identified as metabolic disease. On the basis of these results and because the relationship between aspirin and RS has already been proved, public and professional warnings concerning RS on aspirin-containing products in cases of varicella and viral febrile illness have been adopted by the French Drugs Agency.
The release of secretory granules outside the cells increased in frequency, in inverse proportion to the marked decrease in serum prolactin (PRL) levels in human prolactin-secreting adenomas (PRLomas) treated with bromocriptine (CB), a dopamine agonist. Rat pituitary adenomas induced by diethylstilbestrol also showed an increase in exocytosis of the granules despite a reduction in serum PRL levels after CB treatment. To elucidate this curious phenomenon, which is contrary to current general knowledge that serum hormone levels are sustained by the exocytosis of the secretory granules, we combined morphometric analysis with analyses using a cell fractionation technique and immunocytochemistry. The results indicated that the proteins in secretory granules consisted of 90% nonhormonal proteins and 10% PRL. CB treatment did not change the levels of the former, while the levels of the latter were markedly reduced. Immunocytochemistry, using a protein-A gold method, revealed that the secretory granules in rats treated with CB contained fewer PRL molecules than the controls. Serum PRL elevation caused by the exocytoses, estimated by counting the exocytotic granules, were markedly lower (less than 10%) in CB-treated rats than in the controls. It was suggested that, after CB treatment, the composition of secretory granules altered, or that nonhormonal constituents in the granules disintegrated more slowly, and that the granules became detectable at the site of release for a longer period. Consequently, although granules that appear ultrastructurally similar to those in untreated adenomas are observed to be more frequently released in treated adenomas, it seems that they no longer contribute to raising the serum PRL levels.
Patients with advanced adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) have limited treatment options after failure of chemotherapy. Tumor IGF2 expression has been shown to be amplified in the majority of cases of ACC and autocrine/paracrine activation of the IGF receptor (IGF-R) is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of ACC. It has been shown in vitro that inhibition of the IGF-R inhibits ACC cell proliferation. mTOR is a downstream effector of the IGFR signaling pathway; therefore, the rapamycin analog everolimus could prove to be useful for treatment of patients with ACC. Four women with ACC (ages 25-60 years) developed stage IV disease after surgery. All had progressive disease (PD) despite treatment with mitotane and other treatment modalities (etoposide, doxorubicin, cis-platinum in 3/4 patients, further streptozotocin + 5-FU in 1/4 patients, further thalidomide therapy in 2/4 patients; 1 patient progressed on an IGF-R antagonist). The patients were started on everolimus 10 mg/day orally and 2/4 patients also continued mitotane. Disease progression was monitored monthly by CT in 3/4 and after 3 months in 1/4. In all patients everolimus was well tolerated. In the three patients monitored monthly, PD was evident after 1, 3, and 4 months; in the patient evaluated after 3 months PD was also evident. In this small exploratory study, no clinically meaningful response was observed with everolimus in four patients with advanced ACC. The failure of efficacy could be related to an interaction with mitotane, multiple signaling pathways, and/or other downstream IGF-R effectors operative in the pathogenesis of ACC.
We evaluated the efficacy of the 60% lidocaine tape in alleviating pain associated with intravenous propofol administration in 71 gynecological patients. Thirty-eight women had the tape applied for 2.5 h before venipuncture, with the remaining patients acting as the control. A 20 gauge cannula was inserted into the cephalic vein. Propofol at room temperature was injected at a rate of 1200 ml.hr-1. The statistical significance of differences was established with the Mann-Whitney's U test and the chi 2 test. The median level of pain intensity resulting from venipuncture among the patients treated with the tape was smaller than that in the control group (16.5, vs 34, P = 0.006). Thereafter, cannulation was successfully achieved with reduced or no pain (VAS at cannulation < or = 25, n = 39), and only 16% of the treatment group complained of pain on injection as compared with 53.8% of the control group (P = 0.02). Moreover, the pain intensity was decreased with lidocaine tape (P = 0.006). The cost of the lidocaine tape is covered by medical insurance for reducing pain on venipuncture. Thus, as the tape also alleviates the pain on injection of propofol through its anesthetic action, it can be a safe, easy and cost-effective method as "it kills two pains with one tape".
Sixty adult patients were assigned to one of 3 groups according to the anesthetic technique chosen: isolfurane inhalation, propofol infusion at a higher rate, and propofol infusion at a lower rate supplemented with epidural anesthesia. When the patients regained consciousness and orientation after surgery, they were shown a digit and asked to confirm it verbally. Memory of the digit was tested on the following day. The percentages of the patients who were able to recall the digit were significantly different among the 3 groups, 5%, 40% and 80%, respectively. We concluded that the amnesic effect of propofol was weaker than that of isoflurane when compared immediately after anesthesia. This tendency was more conspicuous when the dose of propofol was less with epidural anesthesia.
This is a retrospective review of three male patients with verapamil-sensitive left ventricular tachycardia, severe coronary artery disease, and past myocardial infarction. Each patient had severe left ventricular dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 34%). Each tachycardia had a right bundle branch block/left axis deviation morphology, which was sustained with isoproterenol. One patient had incessant tachycardia 3 days after coronary bypass surgery. Electrophysiology and clinical parameters were suggestive of triggered activity rather than reentry. Each tachycardia was terminated with verapamil but failed with adenosine, beta blockers, and class I/III antiarrhythmics. Prior cases of verapamil-sensitive ventricular tachycardia have been seen in patients without organic heart disease, and the putative mechanism appears to be reentry. These patients with ischemic coronary artery disease may exhibit a mechanism of triggered activity in the Purkinje system region, which is responsive to calcium channel blockade. Successful radiofrequency ablation was guided by Purkinje potentials.
Prophylactic drug trials in migraine are long-lasting and expensive and require long-term toxicology information. A human migraine model would therefore be helpful in testing new drugs. Immediate headache and delayed migraine after glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) has been well characterized. We have recently shown that sodium valproate has prophylactic effect in the GTN model. Here we report our experience with propranolol in this model. Nineteen subjects with migraine without aura and 16 sex- and aged-matched healthy subjects were included in a two-centre randomized double-blind cross-over study. Fourteen migraine subjects and 14 healthy subjects completed the study and results from comparison of the 28 subjects are reported. Randomly propranolol 160 mg or placebo were each given daily for 14 days to both migraine and healthy subjects. A 20-min intravenous infusion of GTN 0.25 microg/kg per min was administered on a study day at the end of both pretreatment periods. Headache was registered for 12 h after GTN infusions. Its intensity was scored on a numerical verbal rating scale from 0 to 10. Fulfilment of International Headache Society (HIS) criteria was recorded for 24 h. Radial and superficial temporal artery diameters and blood velocity of both middle cerebral arteries were measured. All migraine subjects developed headache after GTN. No reduction of overall peak headache was found after propranolol (median 5, range 0-7) compared with placebo (median 5, range 0-10) (P = 0.441). Eight of the 14 completing migraine subject developed IHS 1.1 migraine after GTN, two subjects on both days, three subjects only after placebo, and three subjects only after propranolol. No reduction of GTN-induced migraine was found after propranolol compared with placebo (5 vs. 5, P = 1.000). All healthy subjects developed headache after GTN. No reduction of overall peak headache was found after propranolol (median 2, range 1-5) compared with placebo (median 1, range 1-7) (P = 0.315). Two subjects fulfilled IHS criteria 1.1 for migraine without aura after propranolol but not after placebo. The fulfilment was short lasting and did not require rescue medication. Headache after GTN was more pronounced in migraine subjects than in healthy subjects both with (P = 0.003) and without pretreatment with propranolol (P = 0.017). We found that 2 weeks of propranolol constricted the radial artery in healthy subjects but not in migraine subjects. GTN-induced vasodilatation abolished this difference. Mean maximum blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery was higher in healthy subjects than in migraine patients (P = 0.003-0.033) and unaffected by propranolol. We observed no effect of propranolol on GTN-induced headache and migraine. This could indicate that GTN induces migraine at a deeper level of the pathophysiological cascade of migraine than the prophylactic effect of propranolol. Propranolol does not constrict cerebral arteries, which therefore cannot be part of its mechanism of action in migraine.
Hydrocarbons are major contaminants that may affect biota at various trophic levels in estuaries and coastal ecosystems. The effects of accidental pollution by light cycle oil (LCO), a refined product of heavy fuel oil, on bioaccumulation, depuration processes and immune-related parameters in the European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, were investigated in the laboratory after 7 days of exposure and a 2-week recovery period. Exposure of fish to the soluble fraction of LCO (1600ngL(-1)) for 7 days led to the bioaccumulation of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in muscles: naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene. After 7 days of recovery period, half-elimination of naphthalene was reported in fish muscles due to facilitated diffusive loss by the epithelium and a faster elimination rate proven by the presence of a high level of naphthalene biliary metabolites. The other bioaccumulated molecules displayed a slower depuration rate due to their elimination by the formation of hydrophobic metabolites excreted through bile or urine. Three days after the beginning of the recovery period, each contaminated fish showed severe external lesions (tissue necrosis, suppurative exudates, haemorrhagic area). The hypothesis of a possible link with inflammatory phenomenon was supported by (i) an inversion of the leucocyte sub-population percentage, (ii) a significant up-expression in the spleen of the tumour necrosis factor alpha gene, (iii) a significant increase in ACH(50). Moreover, the lack of C3 gene regulation in the spleen suggested a non-renewal of this component. The reduction of phagocytic activity and lysozyme concentration reflected immune suppression. Finally, LCO toxicity in this fish was clearly demonstrated to be related to inflammatory reaction and immune depletion.
Unpleasant sensory symptoms are commonly reported in association with the use of 5-HT1B/1D-agonists, i.e. triptans. In particular, pain/pressure symptoms from the chest and neck have restricted the use of triptans in the acute treatment of migraine. The cause of these triptan induced side-effects is still unidentified. We have now tested the hypothesis that sumatriptan influences the perception of tactile and thermal stimuli in humans in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Two groups were tested; one consisted of 12 (mean age 41.2 years, 10 women) subjects with migraine and a history of cutaneous allodynia in association with sumatriptan treatment. Twelve healthy subjects (mean age 38.7 years, 10 women) without migraine served as control group. During pain- and medication-free intervals tactile directional sensibility, perception of dynamic touch (brush) and thermal sensory and pain thresholds were studied on the dorsal side of the left hand. Measurements were performed before, 20, and 40 min after injection of 6 mg sumatriptan or saline. Twenty minutes after injection, sumatriptan caused a significant placebo-subtracted increase in brush-evoked feeling of unpleasantness in both groups (P < 0.01), an increase in brush-evoked pain in migraineurs only (P = 0.021), a reduction of heat pain threshold in all participants pooled (P = 0.031), and a reduction of cold pain threshold in controls only (P = 0.013). At 40 min after injection, no differences remained significant. There were no changes in ratings of brush intensity, tactile directional sensibility or cold or warm sensation thresholds. Thus, sumatriptan may cause a short-lasting allodynia in response to light dynamic touch and a reduction of heat and cold pain thresholds. This could explain at least some of the temporary sensory side-effects of triptans and warrants consideration in the interpretation of studies on migraine-induced allodynia.
Dipyridamole 0.56 mg/kg was administered intravenously for thallium tomography after myocardial infarction. Fast atrial fibrillation developed which failed to resolve with aminophylline. Sinus rhythm returned within 3 days. Myocardial tomography revealed apical infarction without reversible ischaemia. Atrial fibrillation after dipyridamole is rare and may be caused by direct electrophysiological effects on the atrial myocardium.
A 73-year-old female weighing 41 kg who had undergone ilecolostomy under general anesthesia showed extremely prolonged apnea. Despite only 7 mg of vecuronium, she needed postoperative mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. A postoperative examination revealed hypermagnesemia, which probably potentiated the effect of vecuronium. Her hypermagnesemia might be caused by chronic renal failure with hypocalcemia and administration of magnesium sulfate as a cathartic. Plasma magnesium concentration should be measured perioperatively in all surgical cases.
Previous studies from this and a number of laboratories have demonstrated that the majority of both focal and nodular lesions which occur during the early phase of multistage hepatocarcinogenesis in the rodent disappear or 'remodel' upon removal of the promoting agent. Utilizing techniques of quantitative stereology we have found that many if not the majority of altered hepatic foci induced by initiation with diethylnitrosamine/partial hepatectomy and promoted for 4 months with phenobarbital disappear with little or no morphologic evidence of remodeling within 10 days after withdrawal from phenobarbital and do not reappear for a 6-month period thereafter. However, administration of phenobarbital in the diet following an interval period of 10, 20, 30 or 90 days in the absence of the promoting agent resulted in the reappearance of these focal lesions at the same or an increased numerical level. The volume occupied by these focal lesions, which reflects the total numbers of altered cells present in the liver, increased somewhat even during the interval absence of phenobarbital but increased dramatically upon readministration of the promoting agent. Rats fed only a semi-purified diet for 180 days following a 4-month period of phenobarbital promotion of initiated animals exhibited a greater number but only half the total volume of altered hepatic foci, as did rats fed a cereal-based diet only for 180 days. The cereal-based diet (NIH-07) may contain some unknown initiating and/or promoting factors responsible for this phenomenon. These studies present further evidence both for the reversible nature of the stage of promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis and the irreversible characteristic of the stage of initiation, as well as the importance of the composition of the diet utilized in models of multistage hepatocarcinogenesis.
1. Endosulfan insecticide is a polychlorinated compound used for controlling a variety of insects; it is practically water-insoluble, but readily adheres to clay particles and persists in soil and water for several years. Its mode of action involves repetitive nerve-discharges positively correlated to increase in temperature. This compound is extremely toxic to most fish and can cause massive mortalities. In fish, it causes marked changes in Na and K concentrations, decrease in blood Ca(2+) and Mg levels and inhibits Na, K and Mg-dependent ATPase (in brain). 2. Bioaccumulation of endosulfan is reported for marine animals; however, freshwater animals (e.g., crayfish) accumulate it to some extent, but they lose the compound rapidly during depuration. Endosulfan is generally less toxic to aquatic invertebrates than fish. However, it causes decreases in adenylate energy charge, oxygen consumption, hemolymph amino acids, succinate dehydrogenase, heart-beat (mussel) and altered osmoregulation. 3. Generally, mammals are less susceptible to endosulfan's toxicity than aquatic animals. The majority of studies conducted on laboratory mammals can be summarized. (a) Neurotoxicity: male rats are more sensitive than females to endosulfan, which decreases brain and plasma acetylcholinesterase activity. Endosulfan I (a metabolite) causes a significant change in norepinephrine, 5-HT and GABA. (b) Renal toxicity: inhibition of MFOs activity was noticed in rats; other effects included changes in proximal convoluted tubules and necrosis of the tubular epithelium. (c) Hepatotoxicity: chemically-induced aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydrolase were found in rat liver, and reduction in the glycogen level occurred. (d) Hematologic toxicity: endosulfan exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the level occurred. (d) Hematologic toxicity: endosulfan exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the erythrocyte glutathione reductase, hemoglobin amount, RBC number and mean corpuscular volume. 4. Respiratory toxicity: involved dyspnea, acute emphysema, cyanosis and hemorrhages in teh interalveolar portions of rat's lungs. 5. Biochemical: in rats, endosulfan caused increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, blood glucose level, phospholipid contents of the microsomal and surfactant system, and profoundly induced the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and cytosolic glutathione S-transferases. It also decreased significantly Na+, K+ and Mg(2+) ATPases, plasma calcium level and alkaline phosphatase in the intestinal epithelium. 6. Immunologic toxicity: rat serum antibody titer to tetanus toxin, IgG, IgM and gammaglobulins were significantly reduced. 7. Reproductive toxicity: degenerative changes in the seminiferous epithelium, induction of the rate-limiting enzyme in testosterone production (3beta-hydroxysteroid transferase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid transferase), histological changes in reproductive organs, testicular atrophy and the occurrence of ovarian cysts were noticed in rat. Reduction in the weight of secondary sex organ was also observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Methamphetamine (MA)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals. This study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, on the MA-induced neurotoxicity. Male rats were treated with MA (10 mg/kg, every 2 h for four injections). The rat received either alpha-TC (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration. The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment. alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA-treated rats. These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-TC and DFO. This suggests that alpha-TC and DFO ameliorate the MA-induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress.
The case of a 29 year old man who presented with chest pains after the use of cocaine is reported. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction was made on the electrocardiogram changes and lactate dehydrogenase profile. The diagnosis may be overlooked if there is no direct questioning about the use of drugs such as cocaine. Diazepam has an important role in the management of cardiac complications after cocaine use and should be used early in management. The use of thrombolysis should be a joint decision between the emergency physician and cardiologist.
The present study was designed to investigate whether or not reduction of carnitine content could protect isoproterenol (ISP)-induced myocardial injury using 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) propionate (TMHP), gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase inhibitor. Rats were divided into 4 groups; the control group: untreated, the TMHP-1 group: TMHP (100 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, and ISP (10 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously on the following day, the TMHP-7 group: TMHP (100 mg/kg) for 7 successive days, and ISP (10 mg/kg) on the eighth day, the ISP group: ISP (10 mg/kg) was administered. Rats were cervically dislocated 15 hours after ISP administration, and heart mitochondrial electron-transport activity (NADH-cytochrome c reductase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) were measured enzymatically. Activity of succinate-cytochrome c reductase was not affected significantly by ISP, however, NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase were significantly reduced in the ISP and TMHP groups. Administration with TMHP for 7 successive days lessened the reduction of the activities. Mitochondrial electron-transport system plays an important role in cellular energy transduction. These results suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by ISP is related to carnitine-dependent fatty acid metabolism and that TMHP reduces the myocardial injury.
In the present studies we investigated the mechanism of action of prostaglandin E2 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce emesis and defecation and/or tenesmus in the ferret. The emesis was antagonized significantly (P<0.05) by ondansetron (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and (+)-(2S,3S)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenlypiperidine hydrochloride (CP-99,994; 10 mg/kg, i.p.), but neither compound reduced defecations and/or tenesmus, with ondansetron (0.3 mg/kg) actually producing a slight increase (P<0.05). Droperidol (1 and 3 mg/kg), metoclopramide (0.3 and 3 mg/kg), domperidone (0.3 and 3 mg/kg), promethazine (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) failed to reduce prostaglandin E2 induced emesis. However, droperidol (1 and 3 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) reduced significantly the defecatory and/or tenesmus response (P<0.05). Bilateral abdominal vagotomy was ineffective to reduce emesis and defecations and/or tenesmus. The data suggests that 5-HT3 receptor and NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonists could be useful in the clinic to prevent emesis but not defecations induced by prostaglandin E2.
Captopril lowers blood pressure without increasing heart rate and plasma norepinephrine, which suggests that this drug may potentiate arterial baroreflexes. In eight subjects with untreated essential hypertension, blood pressure was monitored intraarterially and the effects of baroreceptor stimulation or deactivation were assessed by measuring (1) the slopes of the relations between increase or reduction in systolic pressure (intravenous phenylephrine or nitroglycerin) and the resulting lengthening or shortening in R-R interval, and (2) the increase or decrease in mean arterial pressure induced by increasing and decreasing carotid transmural pressure (neck chamber). The measurements were made before and after a hypotensive oral dose of captopril (50 mg). Before captopril, the slopes of the R-R interval changes with increase and reduction in systolic pressure were 8 and 4 ms/mm Hg, respectively. The slopes of the mean arterial pressure changes with increase and reduction in carotid transmural pressure were 0.51 and 0.40 mm Hg, respectively. After captopril, the responses to baroreceptor stimulation were unaltered but those to baroreceptor deactivation were augmented. The pressor and heart rate responses to hand-grip and cold exposure were unchanged by captopril. Administration of captopril is accompanied by a baroreflex potentiation which involves the lower portion of the stimulus-response curve of the reflex. This phenomenon (which may originate at the afferent baroreceptor fibers or centrally) may avoid a reduction in the tonic baroreflex influence during captopril-induced hypotension, thus contributing to the hemodynamic effects of the drug.
In the perivascular sheath of the brachial plexus, the volume of anaesthetic solution determines the quality of anaesthetic cover. Fibrous septa may divide the perivascular space into compartments, leading to inadequate diffusion of the anaesthetic solution. The aim of our study was to obtain good anaesthesia and less complications using high volume of low concentration anaesthetic solution, overcoming the obstacle of the septa with a double approach to the scalene sheath.
Sixty patients scheduled for shoulder capsuloplasty received both Winnie interscalene brachial plexus block and Pippa proximal cranial needle approach. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups. A constant dose of local anaesthetic was administered to each group: Group I (30 patients) received high volume (60 mL of anaesthetic solution) and Group II (30 patients) received low volume of solution (30 mL of anaesthetic solution). Sensory and motor block in the upper limb and complications were evaluated.
In all the patients the quality of anaesthesia obtained at the surgical site was excellent. In Group I also the areas supplied by the medial cutaneous nerves of the arm and forearm, ulnar, median and radial nerves were blocked (P < 0.002). Complications were only observed in Group II and consisted of bradycardia and hypotension (66% of the patients) and phrenic nerve paresis (27% of the patients).
The lower concentration of the anaesthetic solution avoids complications while increased volume provides good analgesic cover. The combination of the Winnie interscalene plexus block and the Pippa proximal cranial needle approach should contribute to fill up the scalene sheath overcoming the septa obstacles.
Anemia after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a common complication due to several reasons. Immunosuppressive drugs play an important role in anemia occurring at 1 month or more after OLT. Several studies describe myelosuppression immunosuppressants such as the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors.
We performed a single-center, prospective trial consisting of a short 30-day course of cyclosporine (CsA) associated with everolimus (EVL) from postoperative day 10 (Group EVL) versus a CsA immunosuppressive regimen (Group CsA) in de novo OLT patients. We explored the influence of immunosuppressive drugs on hematological parameters comparing EVL versus CsA.
Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in the EVL and 12 in the CsA Groups. After OLT, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), white blood cell (WBC), platelets (PLT), transferrin saturation (TSAT), iron, ferritin, and transferrin did not differ significantly between the 2 groups at any time point. Among the patients who reached 6-months of follow-up, 5 (41.7%) EVL and 4 (80%) CsA subjects were anemic (P=not significant [NS]). Only anemia in patients enrolled in Group EVL showed a trend toward the features of microcytic, hypochromic anemia.
Our results demonstrated that de novo anemia in OLT patients treated with EVL monotherapy showed the same incidence as in patients treated with CsA. Hb values remained similar during the entire follow-up. Moreover, overall myelosuppression in the EVL Group was not significantly different from patients in the CsA Group.
