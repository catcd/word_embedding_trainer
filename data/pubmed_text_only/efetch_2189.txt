The aim of this study was to investigate the renoprotective activity of chlorogenic acid (CA) in a murine model of cisplatin (CP)-induced kidney injury. Male BALB/cN mice were gavaged daily with CA at 3, 10 and 30mg/kg for two successive days, 48h after intraperitoneal injection of CP (13mg/kg). On the fifth day, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were significantly increased in CP-intoxicated mice, which was recovered by CA. Renal oxidative stress, evidenced by increased 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) expression, was significantly reduced with CA. Simultaneously, the overexpression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and cytochrome P450 E1 (CYP2E1) was attenuated. The inhibition of inflammatory response by CA was achieved through the reduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Additionally, CA significantly suppressed p53, Bax active caspase-3, cyclin D1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 isoform B (LC3B) expression, suggesting the inhibition of both apoptosis and autophagy. The expression of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (Mrp1 and Mrp2) increased and organic cation transporter 2 (Oct2) decreased by CP, protecting the kidneys from nephrotoxicity by reducing the burden of tubular cells. CA dose-dependently restored Mrp1, Mrp2 and Oct2 expression. The recovery of kidney tissue form CP injury was accompanied by increased proliferating nuclear cell antigen (PCNA) expression. The results of this study suggest that CA attenuates CP-induced kidney injury through suppression of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy, with the improvement in kidney regeneration.
Although multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) confers chemoresistance in some cancer types, its implication on oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear.
We evaluated MRP2 expression by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR using 81 resected specimens from ESCC patients who did or did not receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), including 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CDDP). Correlation between MRP2 expression and response to chemotherapy was also examined in 42 pre-therapeutic biopsy samples and eight ESCC cell lines.
MRP2-positive immunostaining was more frequently observed in ESCCs with NACT than in those without NACT (27.3 vs 5.4%). The MRP2-positive patients showed poorer prognosis than MRP2-negative patients (5-year survival rate, 25.6 vs 55.7%). Concordantly, ESCC with NACT showed 2.1-fold higher mRNA expression of MRP2 than those without NACT (P=0.0350). In pre-therapeutic biopsy samples of patients with NACT, non-responders showed 2.9-fold higher mRNA expression of MRP2 than responders (P=0.0035). Among the panel of ESCC cell lines, TE14 showed the highest MRP2 mRNA expression along with the strongest resistance to CDDP. Inhibition of MRP2 expression by small-interfering RNA reduced chemoresistance to CDDP.
Our data suggested that MRP2 is one of molecules, which regulate the sensitivity to chemotherapy including CDDP in advanced ESCC patients.
Type 1 diabetes appears to progress not as an uncontrolled autoimmune attack on the pancreatic islet beta-cells, but rather in a highly regulated manner. Leukocytic infiltration of the pancreatic islets by autoimmune cells, or insulitis, can persist for long periods of time before the terminal destruction of beta-cells. To gain insight on the final stage of diabetogenesis, we have studied progression to diabetes in a CD4(+) T-cell receptor transgenic variant of the NOD mouse model, in which diabetes can be synchronously induced within days by a single injection of cyclophosphamide. A time-course analysis of the gene expression profiles of purified islets was performed using microarrays. Contrary to expectations, changes in transcripts subsequent to drug treatment did not reflect a perturbation of gene expression in CD4(+) T-cells or a reduction in the expression of genes characteristic of regulatory T-cell populations. Instead, there was a marked decrease in transcripts of genes specific to B-cells, followed by an increase in transcripts of chemokine genes (cxcl1, cxcl5, and ccl7) and of other genes typical of the myelo-monocytic lineages. Interferon-gamma dominated the changes in gene expression to a striking degree, because close to one-half of the induced transcripts issued from interferon-gamma-regulated genes.
Trp-P-2(3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4,3-b] indole) ingestion for 42 d by C3H/HeJJcl mice caused elevation of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) activity and several signs of liver injury. These alterations were not observed in mice fed the diet supplemented with 10% miso. This suggests a preventive effect of miso as to Trp-P-2 induced liver injury.
A 61 year old man experienced oliguric acute renal failure during therapy with indomethacin. Proteinuria (5.1 g/24 hours) and hypertension, which accompanied renal insufficiency, cleared with recovery of function. These features may suggest drug-associated acute kidney failure.
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) and infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) are autosomal recessive syndromes of unknown etiology characterized by multiple, recurring subcutaneous tumors, gingival hypertrophy, joint contractures, osteolysis, and osteoporosis. Both are believed to be allelic disorders; ISH is distinguished from JHF by its more severe phenotype, which includes hyaline deposits in multiple organs, recurrent infections, and death within the first 2 years of life. Using the previously reported chromosome 4q21 JHF disease locus as a guide for candidate-gene identification, we identified and characterized JHF and ISH disease-causing mutations in the capillary morphogenesis factor-2 gene (CMG2). Although CMG2 encodes a protein upregulated in endothelial cells during capillary formation and was recently shown to function as an anthrax-toxin receptor, its physiologic role is unclear. Two ISH family-specific truncating mutations, E220X and the 1-bp insertion P357insC that results in translation of an out-of-frame stop codon, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and were shown to delete the CMG-2 transmembrane and/or cytosolic domains, respectively. An ISH compound mutation, I189T, is predicted to create a novel and destabilizing internal cavity within the protein. The JHF family-specific homoallelic missense mutation G105D destabilizes a von Willebrand factor A extracellular domain alpha-helix, whereas the other mutation, L329R, occurs within the transmembrane domain of the protein. Finally, and possibly providing insight into the pathophysiology of these diseases, analysis of fibroblasts derived from patients with JHF or ISH suggests that CMG2 mutations abrogate normal cell interactions with the extracellular matrix.
Clinical and basic research studies have linked cannabinoid consumption to the onset of psychosis, specially schizophrenia. In the present study we have evaluated the effects of the natural psychoactive constituent of Cannabis (-)-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol on the acute actions of the psychostimulant, D-amphetamine, on behaviour displayed by male rats on a hole-board, a proposed animal model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Cannabinoid-amphetamine interactions were studied (1) 30 min after acute injection of (-)-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (0.1 or 6.4 mg/kg, i.p.); (2) 30 min after the last injection of 14-daily treatment with (-)-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (0.1 or 6.4 mg/kg) and 3) 24 h after the last injection of 14-daily treatment with (-)-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (6.4 mg/kg). Acute cannabinoid exposure antagonized the amphetamine-induced dose-dependent increase in locomotion, exploration and the decrease in inactivity. Chronic treatment with (-)-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol resulted in tolerance to this antagonistic effect on locomotion and inactivity but not on exploration, and potentiated amphetamine-induced stereotypies. Lastly, 24 h of withdrawal after 14 days of cannabinoid treatment resulted in sensitization to the effects of D-amphetamine on locomotion, exploration and stereotypies. Since (-)-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol is a cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist, densely present in limbic and basal ganglia circuits, and since amphetamine enhances monoaminergic inputs (i.e., dopamine, serotonin) in these brain areas, the present data support the hypothesis of a role for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor as a regulatory mechanism of monoaminergic neuron-mediated psychomotor activation. These findings may be relevant for the understanding of both cannabinoid-monoamines interactions and Cannabis-associated psychosis.
Matrilysin, a secreted matrix metalloproteinase and target gene of Wnt signaling, functions in epithelial repair and host defense, but no role in renal injury has been described.
Matrilysin expression was assessed in human kidney specimens by immunohistochemistry, and in experimental renal injury in mice by immunohistochemistry, Northern blotting, and RNase protection assays (RPA). A relationship to Wnt4, which is also induced in renal injury, was determined by RPA and in situ hybridization.
Matrilysin was not detected in the normal human renal tubular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. However, prominent staining was detected in sections from autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease in the cyst lining epithelium, atrophic tubules, and cyst micropolyps, and from hydronephrosis in dilated and atrophic tubules. Matrilysin expression was also induced by acute folic acid nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in the mouse, and expression increased as acute injury progressed to tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Matrilysin staining was primarily localized to epithelium of distal tubule/collecting duct origin in both human and murine renal disease. Wnt signaling can induce matrilysin expression, and we found that the pattern of matrilysin expression during progression of renal fibrosis in the mouse after UUO or folic acid nephropathy, and in the jck model of murine polycystic kidney disease, closely paralleled that of Wnt4.
These observations suggest that matrilysin may have a role in renal tubular injury and progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and that Wnt4 may regulate matrilysin expression in the kidney.
Recent clinical studies have shown that the number of interstitial mast cells increases in various types of renal disease and correlates well with the magnitude of interstitial fibrosis. The present study was conducted to assess the role of mast cells in renal fibrosis by examining an experimental glomerular disease.
A rat model of chronic glomerular disease, puromycin aminonucleoside-nephrosis, was induced in mast cell-deficient (Ws/Ws) and normal (+/+) rats.
The area of interstitial fibrosis was widely distributed at 6 weeks in both groups of rats; however, unexpectedly, the area of interstitial fibrosis was greater in Ws/Ws rats than in +/+ littermates. Biochemical analysis of the hydroxyproline content confirmed the more severe fibrosis in the Ws/Ws rats. The number of mast cells increased in both Ws/Ws and +/+ rats, concomitant with the development of interstitial fibrosis, but was confirmed to be lower in Ws/Ws than in +/+ rats. There were no differences in the numbers of interstitial macrophages and T lymphocytes between the two groups. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of cytokine expression revealed that the level of mRNA for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a potent profibrotic cytokine, was higher in Ws/Ws rats. In addition, heparin, one of the major components of mast cells, inhibited the expression of TGF-beta mRNA in rat fibroblasts in culture.
These results suggest that mast cells do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. Rather, they might be protective or ameliorative in this model through the inhibition of TGF-beta production by heparin, and possibly in other models and also in humans.
The somatostatin (SS) analog octreotide has been successfully used in the treatment of (neuro)endocrine tumors. The mechanism of action of the tumor (growth) inhibitory action by octreotide is not fully understood. We have investigated the effect of octreotide on 7315b rat pituitary tumor cell growth, PRL release, and intracellular PRL concentrations in vitro. When cultured in medium with 10% fetal calf serum, the number of high affinity SS receptors increased with increasing culture time. On days 7, 14, and 21 of culture, the number of SS receptors amounted to 978 +/- 217, 3588 +/- 705, and 5865 +/- 3332 fmol/mg protein, respectively, whereas they were not measurable on day 0. From days 0-7, 7-14, and 14-21 of culture, octreotide (1 pM to 1 microM) inhibited PRL release and the intracellular PRL concentration, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. However, no inhibition of cell growth was observed by these octreotide concentrations from day 0-7 of culture, while octreotide inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent fashion from days 7-14 and 14-21 of culture (maximal inhibition by 25% and 26%, respectively). In a series of nine consecutive experiments we found a significant positive correlation between the percent inhibition of cell growth induced by 1 microM octreotide and the number of SS receptors on 7315b cells (r = 0.7865; P = 0.012). Inhibition of PRL release did not correlate with SS receptor numbers. Octreotide (1 microM) inhibited forskolin (0.5 microM)-stimulated cell growth and intracellular PRL concentrations, while in the presence of a high concentration of forskolin (10 microM), octreotide had no effect on forskolin-stimulated cell growth and intracellular PRL concentrations. In addition, its PRL release inhibitory effect was significantly lower in forskolin-stimulated cultures. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (10 micrograms/liter) completely prevented the inhibition of cell growth by octreotide and diminished the inhibitory effect of octreotide on PRL release. Finally, 1 microM octreotide significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production (by 29% and 53% on days 7 and 14 of culture, respectively). We conclude that 1) octreotide inhibits 7315b rat pituitary tumor cell proliferation via a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein- and adenylate cyclase-dependent mechanism; and 2) the number of SS receptors on 7315b pituitary tumor cells may determine whether octreotide exerts a direct antiproliferative effect, whereas its antihormonal effect occurs in the presence of relatively low numbers of SS receptors. This suggests a dissociation of the antiproliferative and antihormonal effects induced by octreotide.
In pharmacological screening amisulpride produces no catalepsy, no inhibition of stereotypic movements, yet a blockade of drug-induced vomiting. During an open clinical trial lasting 4 weeks, 14 patients (13 schizophrenics) were treated with the compound. The (BPRS-) syndromes anxiety/depression, thought disorder, activity, hostility and the global score showed significant improvement. With the AMDP system significant changes were seen in the paranoid-hallucinatory, manic, depressive and hostility syndromes as well as in the global score. No changes were revealed in anergia (BPRS) and apathia (AMDP). In the EEG a significant decrease in the frequency of alpha-rhythms was found. The scores of the Simpson-scale for extrapyramidal side effects were low, but there was an acute dystonic reaction in one patient. In three cases akathisia occurred; biperiden administration was necessary three times. In conclusion, amisulpride showed good antipsychotic efficacy without sedation. Contrary to expectations based on the pharmacological screening, we did find extrapyramidal side effects.
To diagnose visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), we have developed a nested PCR method based on amplification of the mini-exon gene, which is unique and tandomly repeated in the Leishmania genome. Nested PCR was sufficiently sensitive for the detection of DNA in an amount equivalent to a single Leishmania parasite or less. We examined the usefulness of this PCR method using bone marrow aspirates and buffy coat cells collected from kala-azar patients who had or had not received chemotherapy in northwest China. We obtained PCR positivity for all of the parasitologically positive bone marrow samples from the patients. Some ambiguities with the primary PCR results were eliminated by the subsequent nested PCR. The buffy coat samples from 7 of 12 patients with splenomegaly were positive by the nested PCR, although only 2 of them were positive for parasites by culture. However, buffy coat samples from nine children, whose splenomegaly has been reduced and clinically cured by antimony treatment, were all negative. Thus, this nested PCR method represents a new tool for the diagnosis of kala-azar with patient blood samples instead of bone marrow or spleen aspirates obtained by more invasive procedures.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is expressed by and regulates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In the present study, we investigated whether 6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA or INT-747), a semisynthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), modulates tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor (TIMP)-1 and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 expression/activity in HSCs and in the liver of rats rendered cirrhotic by 4-week administration of CCl(4). Exposure of HSCs to FXR ligands increases small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA by 3-fold and reduces basal and thrombin-stimulated expression of alpha1(I)collagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 by approximately 60 to 70%, whereas it increased matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 activity by 2-fold. In coimmunoprecipitation, electromobility shift, and transactivation experiments, FXR activation/overexpression caused a SHP-dependent inhibition of JunD binding to its consensus element in the TIMP-1 promoter. Inhibition of TIMP-1 expression by SHP overexpression enhanced the sensitivity of HSCs to proapoptogenic stimuli. Administration of 3 mg/kg 6-ECDCA, but not 15 mg/kg ursodeoxycholic acid, resulted in early (3-5-day) induction of SHP and prevention of early up-regulation of TIMP-1 mRNA induced by CCl(4). In the prevention protocol, 4-week administration of 6-ECDCA reduced alpha1(I)collagen, alpha-SMA, and TIMP-1 mRNA by 60 to 80%, whereas it increased MMP-2 activity by 5-fold. In the resolution protocol, administration of 3 mg/kg 6-ECDCA promoted liver fibrosis resolution and increased the apoptosis of nonparenchyma liver cells. By demonstrating that a FXR-SHP regulatory cascade promotes the development of a quiescent phenotype and increases apoptosis of HSCs, this study establishes that FXR ligands may be beneficial in treatment of liver fibrosis.
A 67-year-old male patient with clinically probable multiple system atrophy developed severe reproducible sleepiness and irresistible onset of sleep during an acute levodopa (L-dopa) challenge. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of acute L-dopa challenge, videopolysomnography revealed multiple episodes of non-rapid eye movement sleep 60 minutes after L-dopa and none following placebo. These observations suggest the irresistible sleep can also be induced by L-dopa and also in patients with atypical parkinsonism.
The inhalation anesthetic, isoflurane, induces learning and memory impairment. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are thought to play important roles in isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis. In this study, we treated neuronal cells with isoflurane for 6 h. We found that isoflurane induced the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, increased the levels of reactive oxygen species and the activation of caspase‑3, and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and the intracellular calcium ion concentration. Resveratrol (RESV; trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring phytoalexin, is found at high concentrations in the skin of red grapes and red wine and has been demonstrated to have anti-infective, antioxidant and cardioprotective functions. Our findings demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of RESV were independent on its direct radical scavenging properties. Following treatment of the cells with various concentrations of RESV, we found that RESV induced the expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and damage. The data from the present study demonstrate that RESV effectively protects neuronal cells from isoflurane-induced cytotoxicity by activating the Akt signaling pathway.
Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common sexual dysfunction in men. Since heightened sensitivity of the glans is implicated in PE, it seems reasonable that reducing this sensitivity could have a delaying effect on intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IVELT) without adversely affecting the sensation of ejaculation. We have developed a local anesthetic combination, in a metered-dose aerosol delivery system, that delivers lidocaine and prilocaine in base form without organic solvents. The drug can be easily removed prior to vaginal penetration, circumventing the need for a condom that most patients find undesirable. Herein, we report on a prospective open-label pilot study investigating the safety and efficacy of this novel delivery system for topical local anesthetic to the glans penis aimed at prolonging the IVELT in patients who self-reported having PE. This was an open-label prospective pilot study. The lidocaine-prilocaine (LP) aerosol delivered 7.5 mg lidocaine and 2.5 mg prilocaine, both in base form, per actuation. A total of 14 men who had been referred to urology clinics with the problem of PE were recruited. Consent was obtained from both subjects and their partners. Couples were asked to time their IVELT without treatment on one encounter, and then on five subsequent encounters were asked to apply the spray to the glans penis, leave on for 10-15 min, wipe off carefully before intercourse. The IVELT was timed with a stopwatch and then both partners were asked to rate their individual satisfaction relative to baseline without treatment. They were also asked to document any adverse events or comments. In all, 11 patients completed the study. The average IVELT increased from 1 min:24 s to 11 min:21 s (P=0.008) representing an average eight-fold increase. No subjects experienced a decrease in IVELT. The average satisfaction score for both subjects and partners was 1.0; on a scale where -1 was worse, 0 the same, +1 better and +2 much better. Topical LP spray, applied to the glans penis 15 min before intercourse, prolongs ejaculation time significantly and improves sexual satisfaction in both men with PE and their partners. The glandular numbness, noticed in only two cases, did not adversely affect the quality of the orgasm. Occasionally, a patient reported difficulty maintaining an erection while waiting the required 15 min between application of the spray and the initiation of intercourse.
A female infant is described with cyclopia-astomia-agnathia-holoprosencephaly association. The authors discuss whether the use of salicylates in early pregnancy is implicated.
Eighty-one patients with large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma achieving complete restaging verified remission after induction chemotherapy (CHOP-Bleo or m-BACOD) were randomized to the following 3 arms: 1. No further treatment (observation). 2. Early consolidation therapy with 6 courses of CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) given monthly. 3. Maintenance therapy with cyclophosphamide and prednisone given every 6 weeks for 2 years. The relapse-free survival was better in the maintenance and consolidation arms than in the observation arm. The additional therapy given after the initial complete remission produced lasting disease control in a considerable number of patients and with acceptable toxicity. The authors feel that patients with large-cell lymphoma do not need more aggressive and toxic initial management because the use of maintenance therapy can increase the number of patients remaining in complete remission by more conventional, less toxic chemotherapy.
Azelaic acid (AzA) gel 15% is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea (PPR). Its efficacy and safety as monotherapy have been demonstrated. Release of active drug from the gel formulation is superior to the cream. The combination of AzA gel 15% with oral doxycycline appears to expedite and augment response, especially in cases of PPR of greater severity, and AzA gel 15% maintains control of PPR over 6 months as compared to vehicle. Adjunctive skin care is recommended to augment the therapeutic outcome of PPR and reduce the potential for irritation that can occur with topical therapy.
Tebipenem pivoxil (TBPM-PI), the first oral carbapenem antibiotic both in Japan and abroad, was examined on its convulsive liability. We used ICR male mice and Sprague-Dawley male rats to examine the pro-convulsive effect and anticonvulsive effect of TBPM-PI and its active metabolite, TBPM. (1) When mice were treated with TBPM-PI (30-1000 mg/kg, p.o.) or TBPM (10-300 mg/kg, i.v.), no convulsion was noted at any dose level. When rats were treated with TBPM (300 mg/kg, i.v.), no convulsant effects were noted in electroencephalography or behavioral observation. In intraventricular injection of TBPM in mice, clonic convulsion was observed in 7/10 animals at 100 microg but no effect at 30 microg. On the other hand, the administration of 10/10 microg imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) resulted in clonic convulsion in all animals and tonic convulsion in 3/10 animals, and 4/10 animals died. The administration of 100 microg meropenem did not cause any effects. (2) When mice were co-administered with pentylenetetrazole (45 mg/kg: maximum dose level at which no convulsion is induced) and TBPM-PI (30-300 mg/kg, p.o.) or TBPM (300 mg/kg, i.v.), convulsion enhancing effect was not noted. On the other hand, the co-administration of pentylenetetrazole with IPM/CS (300/300 mg/kg, i.v.) enhanced a convulsive effect of pentylenetetrazole. (3) When mice were treated with TBPM-PI (30-300 mg/kg, p.o.) or TBPM (100 mg/kg, i.v.), inhibitory effect was not noted on convulsions induced by electrostimulation, pentylenetetrazole or strychinine. In conclusion, there were no pro-convulsive effects or anticonvulsive effect in the oral administration of TBPM-PI or intravenous administration of TBPM. Pro-convulsive effect was observed in the intraventricular injection of TBPM as in the case of other carbapenem antibiotics, but such action was weaker than that in IPM/CS administration. Accordingly, the risk of occurrence of convulsion related to TBPM-PI administration was low compared to IPM/CS administration, and TBPM-PI was considered to be less potential to induce convulsions in clinical use.
Patients with substance abuse or dependence often have dreams about alcohol or drugs during early recovery. However, the literature on drug dreams in rehabilitating patients with drug-related disorders remains limited. No data are available on drug dreams in people with substance-related disorders and other major mental illness. As part of a large study on the use of lamotrigine in patients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence, the frequency and nature of drug dreams, triggers for dreams, and response to the dreams during study participation were assessed in 37 outpatients for as long as 36 weeks. Altogether, 74% of participants experienced at least one drug dream during the study. Furthermore, drug dreams rapidly decreased during study participation. The presence of drug dreams at baseline did not predict mood, cocaine craving, or drug use at exit. No clear risk factors for drug dreams were identified. However, drug dreams were related to survival in the study by a negative U-shaped curve relationship in which those participants with the highest and lowest frequency of drug dreams discontinued from the study the earliest. Content of the dreams frequently included drug use or refusing to use the drug. Dreams of drug use tended to occur during the first few weeks of study participation. Most dreams were associated with triggers for drug use. The findings suggest that drug dreams are common in patients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence and are similar in nature to those previously reported in people with pure substance abuse.
Recently, the use of astemizole and terfenadine, both non-sedating H1-antihistamines, caused considerable concern. Several case reports suggested an association of both drugs with an increased risk of torsades de pointes, a special form of ventricular tachycardia. The increased risk of both H1-antihistamines was associated with exposure to supratherapeutic doses; for terfenadine the risk was also associated with concomitant exposure to the cytochrome P-450 inhibitors ketoconazole, erythromycin and cimetidine. To predict the size of the population that runs the risk of developing this potentially fatal adverse reaction in the Netherlands, the prevalence of prescribing supratherapeutic doses and the concomitant exposure to terfenadine and cytochrome P-450 inhibitors was studied. Data were obtained from the PHARMO data base in 1990, a pharmacy-based record linkage system encompassing a catchment population of 300,000 individuals. The results of the study showed that the prescribing of supratherapeutic doses and the concomitant exposure to terfenadine and cytochrome P-450 inhibitors was low. Furthermore, the results of a sensitivity analysis showed that the risk of fatal torsades de pointes has to be as high as 1 in 10,000 to cause one death in the Netherlands in one year.
The author reports five cases of relatively young women, in good general health, except that one of them had alcoholic liver disease, who presented a confusional state on taking neuroleptics: a widely used butyrophenone, prescribed for a psychotic condition. Owing to the low incidence of this side effect, these clinical cases were worth reporting. Furthermore, a trial of interpretation led us to believe that these reductions in consciousness were due to resistance to treatment.
Ibuprofen abuse may be more prevalent than generally considered. Although normally benign, serious complications have been documented. We report an unusual presentation of hypokalaemia and its associated symptoms as a result of Nurofen Plus (200 mg ibuprofen + 12.8 mg codeine phosphate) abuse. Ibuprofen is generally not included in a standard toxicology screen, but should be considered as a rare cause of hypokalaemia.
Chronic exposure of humans to inorganic arsenic, a potent environmental oxidative stressor, is associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). A key driver in the pathogenesis of T2D is impairment of pancreatic beta-cell function, with the hallmark of beta-cell function being glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from glucose metabolism serve as one of the metabolic signals for GSIS. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a central transcription factor regulating cellular adaptive response to oxidative stress.
We tested the hypothesis that activation of Nrf2 and induction of antioxidant enzymes in response to arsenic exposure impedes glucose-triggered ROS signaling and thus GSIS.
Exposure of INS-1(832/13) cells to low levels of arsenite led to decreased GSIS in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Consistent with our hypothesis, a significantly enhanced Nrf2 activity, determined by its nuclear accumulation and induction of its target genes, was observed in arsenite-exposed cells. In keeping with the activation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response, intracellular glutathione and intracellular hydrogen peroxide-scavenging activity was dose dependently increased by arsenite exposure. Although the basal cellular peroxide level was significantly enhanced, the net percentage increase in glucose-stimulated intracellular peroxide production was markedly inhibited in arsenite-exposed cells. In contrast, insulin synthesis and the consensus GSIS pathway, including glucose transport and metabolism, were not significantly reduced by arsenite exposure.
Our studies suggest that low levels of arsenic provoke a cellular adaptive oxidative stress response that increases antioxidant levels, dampens ROS signaling involved in GSIS, and thus disturbs beta-cell function.
In this study, we evaluated whether a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril (B), with an angiotensin type I receptor antagonist (AT1RA), irbesartan (I), is as effective or more than drugs as monotherapy in controlling renal damage in obese Zucker rats (OZR), a model of metabolic syndrome.
During six months, G1 (OZR receiving no treatment); G2 (OZR with B 10 mg/kg/day); G3 (OZR with I 50mg/kg/day); and G4 (OZR with B 5mg/kg/day + I 25 mg/kg/day). Kidneys were processed for light microscopy (LM) and immunohistochemistry, including antibodies against interstitial alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), transforming growth factor-beta(1)(TGF-beta 1), and collagen (COL) I, III, and IV.
All treated groups presented similar reduction in blood pressure compared with untreated OZR. However, animals from G4 (B + I) showed better control on proteinuria together with a higher creatinine clearance. Additionally, G4 showed a significant (P < 0.05) lower kidney weight; smaller glomerular area; lower glomerulosclerosis score; lower percentage of tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and interstitial alpha-SMA; lower tubular PAI-1 score; lower percentage of COL I, III, and IV in renal interstitium; and lower wall/lumen ratio in renal vessels, when compared with the other groups. OZR treated with B and/or I showed a better outcome (P < 0.01) in the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in comparison with untreated OZR.
These results suggest that combined therapy using B and I is more effective than therapy with either drug at monotherapy for controlling renal damage in this animal model. In addition, data presented here reaffirm the benefit of interacting against renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) in the metabolic syndrome.
