It is well known that heavy oil pollution results in various negative impacts on the marine environment. Although there is a low possibility of direct exposure to heavy oil, the chemical substances contained in heavy oil may be released into the environment and accumulated by marine organisms which in turn can be taken by humans via the food chain. In this study, we examined the biological risk of heavy oil extract using the common mouse, whose genetic backgrounds and immune system are well known and relatively homologous to humans. Water-soluble fraction (WSF) was extracted from heavy oil with water and the extract orally administrated to female or male mice for 7 days. In the WSF administrated group, cystoma-like formation was observed in the ovary in approximately 80% of female mice. On the other hand, we found that the prostate gland size in male mice was markedly reduced in comparison with male control mice. Continuous administration of WSF for 28 days resulted in continued hypertrophy of the cystoma around the ovary and atrophy in the prostate gland. In addition, it was revealed that chemical substances within WSF have estrogenic activity. A major component of heavy oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is known to present estrogenic activity. It is likely that the cystoma-like formation in female mice and atrophy of prostate gland in male resulted of estrogenic substances present in the WSF which might be the PAHs.
Sodium metasilicate (SMS) is a key ingredient for a number of industrial and consumer products. Although little is known about potential for this chemical to cause allergic reactions, a similar silicate compound, sodium silicate, was reported to elicit IgE-mediated contact urticaria.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for sodium metasilicate to elicit an allergic response in female BALB/c mice after dermal exposure.
The primary irritancy assay (IA), local lymph node assay (LLNA), and a mouse ear swelling test (MEST) were used to evaluate the hypersensitivity response elicited by SMS exposure. An evaluation of lymph node subpopulations, cytokine mRNA expression, and serum IgE levels was also conducted.
SMS caused significant dermal irritation at concentrations >or=6% and an allergic response after mice were sensitized with 4% SMS then challenged with 6% SMS in the MEST. Lymph node cell proliferation was not observed in the LLNA after treatment with SMS (2% to 6% SMS). Increases in lymph node cellularity, the percentage of B cells, and the expression of certain cytokine mRNAs were observed in mice treated with SMS. Changes in the concentration of serum IgE after SMS treatment, however, were not observed.
SMS appears to elicit a chemical hypersensitivity response in mice, as indicated by the MEST, but not by the LLNA. Increases in auricular lymph node cellularity, the percentage of B cells, and certain cytokine mRNAs support classifying SMS as a weak chemical allergen.
Therapeutically induced autophagic cell death has been proven to be effective in cases of solid tumors. The dual phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 possesses antitumor activity against solid tumors. Inhibition of mTOR has been shown to elicit autophagy. In this study, we examined the antiproliferation and autophagic activities of NVP-BEZ235 in parental and cisplatin-resistant urothelial carcinoma (UC) cells.
Two UC cell lines, NTUB1 and a cisplatin-resistant subline N/P(14), were applied to examine the cytotoxic effect of NVP-BEZ-235. The cell death mechanism was also evaluated.
NVP-BEZ235 was effective in inhibiting the growth of UC cells including parental and cisplatin-resistant cells on flow cytometry assay and Western blot. Although NVP-BEZ235 did not induce LC3-II conversion, it did elicit acidic vesicular organelle (AVO) development on flow cytometry. On Western blot, NVP-BEZ235 decreased p62 and phospho-Rb expressions in a concentration-dependent manner. GFP-LC3 conversion and the appearance of cleaved-GFP following NVP-BEZ235 treatment were demonstrated on Western blot. In addition, lysosomotropic inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ), an agent that is currently in clinical use and a known antagonist of autophagy, resulted in proliferation of UC cells. Thus, inhibition of autophagic flux by CQ appears to be a survival mechanism that counteracts the anticancer effects of NVP-BEZ235.
We demonstrated that NVP-BEZ235 inhibits UC cell proliferation by activating autophagic flux and cell cycle arrest, but does not induce apoptotic cell death. Our findings suggest that the anticancer efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 is due to autophagic flux and co-treatment with CQ counteracts the cytotoxic effect.
Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are the most considerable side effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin that seriously limits its application in medicine. The major mechanism of negative effect of gentamicin on kidney cells involves damage of mitochondria and induction of an oxidative stress that causes cell death resulting in kidney dysfunction. In this work we compared effects of the lithium ions and δ-opioid receptors agonist, dalargin on gentamicin-induced kidney injury. It was revealed that LiCl and dalargin treatment reduced renal tubular cell death and diminished kidney injury caused by gentamicin. Both LiCl and dalargin were found to enhance phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β in the kidney which points to induction of nephroprotective signaling pathways. Thus, we conclude that lithium ions and dalargin might be considered as novel promising agents for future use to prevent negative consequences of therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics.
We examined the cerebral hyperemic response to halothane after treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To determine the involvement of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2), we tested whether the effect of LPS on halothane-induced hyperemia was altered by pretreatment with the selective iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg), COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398 (5 mg/kg), or enzyme expression inhibitor, dexamethasone (4 mg/kg). Further, we examined whether the administration of a nitric oxide donor, diethylamine NONOate, would change the cerebral hyperemic response of halothane. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 0.5 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration of halothane and artificially ventilated. Regional cerebrocortical blood flow (rCBF) was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry. LPS (1 mg/kg) was administered intracerebroventricularly; artificial cerebrospinal fluid was used in controls. Four hours after LPS infusion, iNOS and COX-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and enzyme activities (arginine-citrulline conversion and prostaglandin E(2) enzyme immunoassay) were significantly increased. LPS enhanced halothane-induced 3.9 and 1.6-fold increases in rCBF at 1.0 and 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration, respectively. Co-treatment with NS-398 attenuated, but aminoguanidine or dexamethasone abolished the effect of LPS on halothane-induced rCBF increase. Diethylamine NONOate mimicked the enhanced rCBF response to halothane. These results suggest that LPS augmented halothane-induced cerebrocortical hyperemia by induction of iNOS and COX-2.
We compared the efficacy of the combination of enalaprilat/labetalol with that of enalaprilat/nicardipine to prevent emergence postcraniotomy hypertension. A prospective, randomized open labeled clinical trial was designed to compare the incidence of breakthrough hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > 140 mm Hg) and adverse effects (hypotension, tachycardia, and bradycardia) between the two drug combinations. Secondarily, the effects of the drugs on SBP, mean blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were evaluated over the course of the study. Forty-two patients received enalaprilat 1.25 mg IV at dural closure followed by either multidose nicardipine 2 mg IV or labetalol 5 mg IV to maintain the SBP below 140 mm Hg. SBP was similarly controlled in both groups. There was a marginally smaller incidence of failures and adverse effects with labetalol. Blood pressure profiles were similar for both groups.
Bromodichloromethane (BDCM), a drinking water disinfection by-product, causes pregnancy loss, i.e. full-litter resorption, in F344 rats when treated during the luteinizing hormone (LH)-dependent period. This effect is associated with reduced maternal serum progesterone (P) and LH levels, suggesting that BDCM disrupts secretion of LH. To test the hypothesis that BDCM also affects luteal responsiveness to LH, we used ex vivo and in vitro approaches. For the ex vivo study (i.e., in vivo exposure followed by in vitro assessment), dams were dosed by gavage on gestation days (GD) 6-9 (plug day=GD 0) at 0 or 100 mg/kg/d. One hour after the GD-9 dose, rats were killed, blood was collected, and tissue concentrations of BDCM were assessed. Corpora lutea (CL) were incubated with or without hCG, an LH agonist, to stimulate P secretion. For the in vitro study, CL were pooled from untreated F344 rats on GD 9 and cultured with BDCM at 0, 0.01, 0.10 or 3.0 mM. BDCM was found at highest concentrations in adrenal, ovarian, adipose, and hypothalamic tissues. BDCM treatment decreased serum P and LH levels in vivo. Ex vivo, however, BDCM-exposed CL showed >2-fold increases in P secretion relative to controls. Both control and BDCM-exposed CL displayed a 2.4-fold increase in P secretion in response to hCG challenge. In contrast, in vitro exposures reduced CL responsiveness in a dose-related fashion while baseline levels were unaffected. It is unclear if the ex vivo 'rebound' reflects the removal of the CL from a possible direct inhibitory influence of BDCM, or a response to diminished LH stimulation in vivo. Thus, these data suggest that BDCM disrupts pregnancy in F344 rats via two modes: disruption of LH secretion, and disruption of the CL's ability to respond to LH.
During the peripartum period, cocaine-abusing women are highly susceptible to myocardial infarction. This report describes a case of myocardial infarction diagnosed by increased troponin I levels in a pregnant patient with a history of recent crack cocaine use and severe preeclampsia.
The syndrome of transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) after spinal lidocaine has been presumed to be a manifestation of local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Although TNS is not associated with either lidocaine concentration or dose, its incidence has never been examined with very small doses of spinal lidocaine. One hundred ten adult ASA physical status I and II patients presenting for arthroscopic surgery of the knee were randomly assigned to receive spinal anesthesia with either 1% hypobaric lidocaine 50 mg (Group L50) or 1% hypobaric lidocaine 20 mg + 25 microg fentanyl (Group L20/F25). Hemodynamic data, block height and regression, and time to first micturition and discharge were recorded. Follow-up phone calls were made by a blinded researcher at 48-72 h using a standardized questionnaire. Both groups had a median peak cephalad block level of T10. Lidocaine 50 mg was associated with a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure and a greater need for ephedrine. Time until block regression to the S2 dermatome (80 vs. 110 min) and outpatient time to void (130 vs 162 min) and discharge (145 vs. 180 min) were faster in the L20/F25 group. Complaints of TNS were found in 32.7% of the patients in the L50 group and in 3.6% of the patients in the L20/F25 group. We conclude that spinal anesthesia with lidocaine 20 mg + fentanyl 25 microg provided adequate anesthesia with greater hemodynamic stability and faster recovery than spinal anesthesia with lidocaine 50 mg. The incidence of TNS after spinal lidocaine 20 mg + fentanyl 25 microg was significantly less than that after spinal lidocaine 50 mg.
Although amantadine hydrochloride has been extensively used for the prevention of influenza A2, few data exist regarding its safety in pregnancy. We report the outcome of a pregnancy during which the mother was treated with amantadine in the first trimester. The infant, born at 29 weeks gestation, has tetralogy of Fallot and tibial hemimelia. Follow-up of the four prospective cases known to date to the Motherisk Program in Toronto did not identify any abnormalities.
Porphyria cutanea tarda, a metabolic disorder of heme biosynthesis, is characterized by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, facial hypertrichosis, dark urine, and a distinctive pattern of excess porphyrin production. Hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity is markedly reduced in patients with this disorder. Although porphyria cutanea tarda may be familial, it is more often sporadic in occurrence, and has been associated with excess alcohol ingestion, estrogen administration, iron overload, and several environmental hepatotoxins. It has also been associated on occasion with malignancy. We report a 46-yr-old woman with ovarian carcinoma who developed porphyria cutanea tarda while undergoing treatment with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. The temporal course of the porphyrin abnormality suggested that cyclophosphamide was the pathogenic agent, and symptoms regressed after cessation of this drug with continued administration of cisplatin. The pathogenesis of the porphyria is not clear; however, cyclophosphamide is a substrate for cytochrome P450, and may produce metabolites that destroy this protein. The resulting increased turnover of heme might then result in overproduction of porphyrin precursors, resulting in the clinical syndrome. Studies of porphyrin metabolism in patients treated with cyclophosphamide may help to elucidate this possibility.
The aim of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction is the early, complete and sustained restoration of bloodflow in the infarct-related artery. In a randomized trial in 421 patients with acute myocardial infarction front-loaded rt-PA (100 mg in 90 min) showed a significantly higher 90-min patency (84.4%) in comparison with APSAC (70.3%). In-hospital mortality was significantly lower after rt-PA (2.4%) versus 8.1% after APSAC. While a single bolus injection of rt-PA produced lower patency and higher reocclusion rates, double bolus injections showed more promising results (90 min patency > 70%). A new recombinant plasminogen activator BM 06.022 (r-PA) with a longer half life can be given as a single bolus injection. In a dose-finding study r-PA produced rapid thrombolysis with a 90-min patency of 66% (10 MU) and 76% (15 MU). There was no excess in re-occlusions or bleeding complications. Although these results are quite promising, the search for the ideal thrombolytic strategy is still ongoing.
Superoxide anion can modulate vascular smooth muscle tone and is potentially involved in diabetic vascular complications. The present study was undertaken to characterize both vascular production and the enzymatic source of superoxide anion in type 2 diabetic rats. In the thoracic aorta of OLETF rats, endothelium-dependent relaxation was markedly attenuated compared with that of control (LETO) rats in association with a significant increase in superoxide production (2,421.39 +/- 407.01 nmol x min(-1) x mg(-1)). The increased production of superoxide anion was significantly attenuated by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI; 10 micromol/l), an inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase. The production of superoxide anion in response to NADH as a substrate was markedly increased in the vascular homogenates, but NADPH, arachidonic acid, xanthine, and succinate produced only small increases in chemiluminescence. In line with these results, studies using various enzyme inhibitors, such as DPI, allopurinol, rotenone, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, and indomethacin, suggest that the predominant source of superoxide anion in vascular particulate fraction is NADH-dependent membrane-bound oxidase. Furthermore, the expression of p22phox, a major component of vascular NAD(P)H oxidase, was markedly increased in the aorta from OLETF rats compared with that of LETO rats. These findings suggest that upregulated expression of p22phox mRNA and enhanced NADH oxidase activity contribute to the impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in OLETF rats.
The electrocardiograms (ECG) of 99 cocaine-abusing patients were compared with the ECGs of 50 schizophrenic controls. Eleven of the cocaine abusers and none of the controls had ECG evidence of significant myocardial injury defined as myocardial infarction, ischemia, and bundle branch block.
To evaluate the effect of controlled exposure to inhaled lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the pulmonary inflammatory response of anesthetized pigs.
Forty-seven 8- to 12-week-old domestic pigs.
Pigs were anesthetized with pentobarbital, instrumented for measurement of cardiopulmonary function, and randomly assigned to receive saline (0.9% NaCI) solution or 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 microg of LPS/kg/h for 2 or 6 hours via nebulization through the endotracheal tube. Cardiopulmonary variables were measured, ex vivo neutrophil superoxide production determined, and postmortem assessment for pulmonary neutrophil influx and modulation of adhesion molecule (E-selectin) expression was done.
Mild changes in cardiopulmonary function were observed in response to inhaled LPS in the 2-and 6-hour groups. In pigs inhaling LPS (0.5 or 1.0 microg/kg/h) for 6 hours, there was significant pulmonary neutrophil influx observed postmortem. An increase in expression of E-selectin on pulmonary endothelial cells after 6 hours of LPS inhalation (0.5 microg/kg/h) was also observed. In contrast, there was no significant influx of neutrophils or expression of E-selectin in lungs from pigs inhaling LPS for 2 hours.
inhalation of LPS resulted in localized pulmonary inflammation characterized by neutrophil influx and increased expression of the endothelial cell adhesion molecule, E-selectin. It may be possible to relate our experimental findings to the clinical consequences of airborne LPS exposure in swine confinement facilities.
Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor and comitogen for vascular smooth muscle. As such, it has been implicated in pulmonary vascular remodeling and in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Prostacyclin has been shown to be an effective therapy for human pulmonary hypertension, reducing morbidity and mortality, although the mechanism of its action is unknown. Here, we show that the combination of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma induces the release of endothelin-1 from human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells via increased transcription of prepro endothelin-1. The release of endothelin-1 and the transcription of prepro endothelin-1 mRNA were inhibited by the activity of coinduced cyclooxygenase-2. Endothelin-1 release was also inhibited by a prostacyclin-mimetic (cicaprost). Thus, under inflammatory conditions, in which vascular smooth muscle is an important source of endothelin-1, the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 represents an endogenous "braking" mechanism. In addition, the beneficial effects of prostacyclin in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension may be caused, at least in part, by the inhibition of endothelin-1 release. Finally, we suggest that these observations may help to explain why patients with pulmonary hypertension experience exacerbations after taking indomethacin and that the newly introduced selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may increase endothelin-1 production in susceptible patients, leading to vascular remodeling and the development of pulmonary hypertension.
We present a case of a patient with non-resected epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal, treated with a combination of radiotherapy regional and chemotherapy according to MMC-Ufelos protocol. After the application of the fourth chemotherapy cycle, the patient presented microangiopathic hemolytic anemia associated to Mitomycin-C, which was treated with the application of recurrent plasmapheresis and restricted transfusions of red corpuscles concentrate. The physiopathology of this disorder and its therapeutical implications are review.
To determine the mechanism responsible for nitrogen dioxide (NO2)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, we examined the effects of NO2 exposure on the contractile response to histamine and the level of histamine N-methyltransferase (HMT) activity, a histamine-degrading enzyme, in guinea pig trachea in vitro. Guinea pigs were divided into seven groups. Each group received continuous NO2 exposure (2.0 ppm) for either 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 96 h. The remaining group did not receive NO2 exposure (control). HMT activity in trachea was decreased from the control value of 70.3 +/- 7.7 pmol/min/mg protein to 34.6 +/- 6.7 pmol/min/mg protein by 12 h exposures of NO2. However, 24 and 48 h exposures of NO2 did not significantly alter HMT activity. In contrast, HMT activity exceeded the control value by 96 h exposures of NO2 (85.5 +/- 5.1 pmol/min/mg protein). Twelve hour exposures of NO2 shifted the concentration-response curves to histamine to lower concentrations and significantly reduced the median effective concentration (EC50) of histamine (log M) from the control value of -5.16 +/- 0.09 to -6.15 +/- 0.14 (P < 0.01). In contrast, the EC50 concentration of histamine (log M) increased from the control value of -5.20 +/- 0.10 to -4.90 +/- 0.11 by 96 h exposures of NO2 (P < 0.05). However, NO2 exposure did not alter the contractile response to acetylcholine. Morphologically, tracheal epithelial cells had vacuoles after 12 h exposures of NO2, but denudation of the epithelium did not occur during this experiment. In situ hybridization for HMT mRNA demonstrated that the level of HMT mRNA increased dominantly in tracheal epithelial cells after 96 h exposures of NO2. The present results indicated that the decrease in the level of HMT activity in the trachea was closely associated with the increase in the airway contractile response to histamine, suggesting that NO2-induced transient airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine is due to the decreased capacity of histamine catabolism in airway.
Recent studies have demonstrated that RANTES, a member of the CC chemokine family affecting monocytes, T cells, basophils, and eosinophils, is expressed by several cell types. To investigate whether human bronchial epithelial cells can also express this chemokine, we investigated human bronchial epithelial cells for their ability to synthesize RANTES, both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we investigated the effect of treatment for 4 mo with inhaled corticosteroids on the expression of RANTES in these cells in vivo. Human bronchial epithelial cells cultured from surgical tissue expressed the mRNA for RANTES and synthesized RANTES, as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemical staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Incubation of the cultures with 50 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) significantly increased the release of RANTES into culture medium after 18 to 48 h of incubation, an effect that was abolished by treatment of the cultures with anti-TNF-alpha antibody. RANTES was also expressed in the bronchial epithelium in vivo, as indicated by positive immunocytochemical staining of bronchial biopsy tissues obtained from mild asthmatic patients before and after treatment with 500 micrograms of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) twice daily or matched placebo for 4 mo. Quantitation, by color image analysis, of the percentage of epithelium staining for RANTES showed that treatment with BDP decreased the expression of RANTES in the bronchial epithelium from 17.12% to 4.22% (P < 0.05). The numbers of EG2-staining cells in the epithelium were also reduced, from 790.1/mm2 to 203.3/mm2 (geometric mean; P < 0.01), after BDP treatment. These results suggest that human bronchial epithelial cells are capable of synthesizing RANTES and may therefore play an important role in the development of inflammation in allergic airways disease. Furthermore, corticosteroids may prevent airway inflammation by downregulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchial epithelium.
In light of the resurgence in MDMA use and its association with polysubstance use, we investigated the 12-month prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDs) among adult MDMA users to determine whether they are at risk of other drug-related problems that would call for targeted interventions.
Data were drawn from the 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Past-year adult drug users were grouped into three mutually exclusive categories: 1) recent MDMA users, who had used the drug within the past year; 2) former MDMA users, who had a history of using this drug but had not done so within the past year; and 3) other drug users, who had never used MDMA. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate the association between respondents' SUDs and MDMA use while adjusting for their socioeconomic status, mental health, age of first use, and history of polydrug use.
Approximately 14% of adults reported drug use in the past year, and 24% of those past-year drug users reported a history of MDMA use. Recent MDMA users exhibited the highest prevalence of disorders related to alcohol (41%), marijuana (30%), cocaine (10%), pain reliever/opioid (8%), and tranquilizer (3%) use. Adjusted logistic regression analyses revealed that, relative to other drug users, those who had recently used MDMA were twice as likely to meet criteria for marijuana and pain reliever/opioid use disorders. They were also about twice as likely as former MDMA users to meet criteria for marijuana, cocaine, and tranquilizer use disorders.
Seven out of ten recent MDMA users report experiencing an SUD in the past year. Adults who have recently used MDMA should be screened for possible SUDs to ensure early detection and treatment.
Rhabdomyolysis is known as one of the possible causes of acute renal failure and can be triggered by different situations. In recent years, Parkinson's disease emerged as a condition that can be complicated by the development of rhabdomyolysis and consequently, in some cases, of acute renal failure. We report two cases of rhabdomyolysis, one of which complicated by an oligo-anuric renal failure, which occurred in patients affected by Parkinson's disease and admitted to our Division.
The first case occurred in a 90-year-old Parkinsonian woman, under treatment with Levodopa-Benserazide and Bornaprine. She developed rhabdomyolysis (CPK 1746 U/L with MB isoenzyme 3.5 ng/ml, LDH 610 U/L, GOT 78 U/L) after she had been found lying on the floor, in a state of mental confusion, after 24 hours in which her relatives had not heard from her. During the first two days of hospitalization, the patient also had a fever (axillary temperature between 37 degrees C and 38 degrees C), accompanied by mild leukocytosis (WBC 13000/mm3) on entrance. The second case occurred in a 78-year-old Parkinsonian woman, under treatment with Levodopa-Carbidopa, Levodopa-Benserazide and Pramipexol. She developed a severe rhabdomyolysis (CPK 34800 U/L with MB isoenzyme 771 ng/ml, LDH 2133 U/L, GOT 785 U/L) complicated by acute renal failure with anuria, after two days characterized by several episodes of vomit and diarrhea. In the following days we learned that in the last 20 days before admission to hospital the patient had increased the dose of her anti-Parkinson therapy and was almost always disturbed by severe choreiform and dystonic movements.
Regarding the first case, the clinical conditions in which the patient was found, the simultaneous presence of fever and leukocytosis and the absence of any reasonable explanation for a hypothetical fall to the floor induced us to think that this was a case of rhabdomyolysis in the context of an akinetic hyperthermic crisis. This is a syndrome that can develop in Parkinsonian patients after discontinuance or simply reduction of therapy with dopaminergic agents and is characterized also by rhabdomyolysis. The fact that the patient was living alone would confirm this hypothesis. On the other hand, the second case of rhabdomyolysis must probably be related to the severe choreiform and dystonic movements that the patient developed in the days just prior to admission. These movements were surely caused by the increase of the substitutive therapy with Levodopa by the patient herself. In conclusion, these two clinical cases, together with others previously reported by other Authors, show how the circumstances leading to the development of acute episodes of rhabdomyolysis in Parkinson's disease can be different and, at the same time, how these circumstances are always somehow related to the treatment of the basic disease with dopaminergic drugs.
High dose glucocorticoids (GC) are commonly used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The frequencies, occurrence day and dose-dependency for side effects may be different among the events such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, infectious disease, osteoporosis, and peptic ulcer. We investigated GC-induced side effects in 68 patients treated with GC for autoimmune diseases. Initial dose of GC (prednisolone equivalent) was 0.67+/-0.35 mg/kg/d. Hypercholesterolemia (66%), hypertension (62%), insomnia (50%), hypertriglyceridemia (44%), excessive appetite (38%), hyperglycemia (18%), digestive symptom (16%), moon-shaped face (13%) and oral candidiasis (12%) were observed in 63 patients treated with GC. Hypercholesterolemia, excessive appetite, digestive symptom, moon-shaped face, and oral candidiasis were associated with the initial dose of prednisolone greater than 0.80 mg/kg/d. Insomnia [median 6 days (range 1-88)], excessive appetite [7 days (2-57)], hypertension [8 days (1-37)], digestive symptom [15 days (1-87)] and hypercholesterolemia [19 days (3-77)] were observed early after 6-19 days starting GC. On the other hand, hypertriglyceridemia [33 days (2-131)], oral candidiasis [35 days (7-52)] and hyperglycemia [60 days (4-134)] were developed after 33-60 days starting GC. Since the frequencies, dose-dependency and occurrence day were different among the side effects of GC, medical staffs including physicians and pharmacists should pay attention such features of the events in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
Although effective in neuropathic pain, the efficacy of systemic lidocaine in non-neuropathic pain remains uncertain. We investigated the analgesic effect of systemic lidocaine on the heat/capsaicin sensitization model of experimental pain in 24 volunteers. Sensitization was produced by heating the skin to 45 degrees C for 5 min, followed by a 30-min application of 0.075% capsaicin cream, and maintained by periodically reheating the sensitized skin. Subjects received IV lidocaine (bolus 2 mg/kg, then infusion 3 mg. kg. h), or saline for 85 min. Areas of secondary hyperalgesia, heat pain detection thresholds, and painfulness of stimulation with 45 degrees C for 1 min (long thermal stimulation) were quantified. Systemic lidocaine reduced the area of secondary hyperalgesia to brush, but not to von Frey hair stimulation. Lidocaine did not alter heat pain detection thresholds or painfulness of long thermal stimulation in normal skin. We conclude that, at infusion rates in the low- to mid-antiarrhythmic range, lidocaine has no effect on acute nociceptive pain but does have a limited and selective effect on secondary hyperalgesia.
The efficacy of systemic lidocaine in nonneuropathic pain remains uncertain. This study investigates the effect of systemic lidocaine on experimental-induced hyperalgesia in 25 volunteers. Hyperalgesia was induced by using an experimental pain model that uses heat and capsaicin in combination. Systemic lidocaine showed a selective effect on secondary hyperalgesia.
The effect of diazinon (DZN) on the activities of cholinesterase (ChE) in plasma and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in erythrocyte and brain was investigated in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme activity was also estimated by measuring the systemic clearance of antipyrine, and the expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A2 and CYP1A2, which is closely related to the metabolism from DZN to DZN-oxon, a strong inhibitor of both ChE and AChE. No significant differences in the activities of ChE in plasma and AChE in erythrocyte were observed between normal and diabetic rats. Treatment with DZN significantly decreased these activities in diabetic rats more than in normal rats 6h after injection (6.5 mg/kg). Treatment with DZN significantly decreased the activity of AChE in brain of diabetic rats than normal rats 3h after injection (65 mg/kg), although no significant difference in the activity was found between normal and diabetic rats. The urinary recovery of diethylphosphate (DEP), a metabolite of DZN-oxon, was significantly increased in diabetic rats, but that of diethylthiophosphate (DETP), a metabolite of DZN, was unchanged. Significant increases in the systemic clearance of antipyrine and protein levels of hepatic CYP1A2, not CYP3A2, were observed in diabetic rats. These results suggest the possibility that a metabolite of DZN, DZN-oxon, causes higher toxicity in diabetic rats due to the enhancement of hepatic CYP1A2-mediated metabolism of DZN.
The pineal hormone melatonin has been reported to protect tissue from oxidative damage. This study was designed to determine whether melatonin could prevent cell events leading to tissue injury and renal dysfunction after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Using an in vivo rat model of I/R, we show a significant increase in kidney malondialdehyde concentrations, reflecting lipid peroxidation, and cell apoptosis measured by TUNEL staining. This apoptotic cell death was associated with an increase in the activity of the proapoptotic factor caspase-3, determined by fluorometric protease activity assay. Histomorphological analysis of ischemic kidneys revealed that the most extensive tubular necrosis occurred at 24 and 48 h after reperfusion, which correlated with peak elevations in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Rat pretreatment with melatonin prevented lipid peroxidation, cell apoptosis, and necrosis and blocked caspase-3 activity. The prevention of tissue injury was associated with the improvement of renal function as shown by the decrease in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations. The demonstration that melatonin prevents postreperfusion apoptotic and necrotic cell death and improves renal function suggests that melatonin may represent a novel therapeutic approach for prevention of I/R injury.
Administration of an extract from the plant Withania somnifera (Family: Solanaceae) (20 mg/dose/animal; i.p.) for five days along with cyclophosphamide (CTX) (1.5 mmol/kg body wt. i.p.) reduced the CTX induced urotoxicity. Morphological analysis of the bladders of the CTX-treated group showed severe inflammation and dark coloration whereas CTX along with the Withania-treated group showed normal bladder morphology. The extract was found to reduce the protein level in the serum (7.92 g/l) after 4 h of CTX treatment, which was higher in the CTX alone-administered group (11.44 g/l). Blood urea N2 level which was drastically enhanced (136.78 mg/100 ml) 2 after the CTX treatment was significantly reduced (52.08 mg/100 ml) when the animals were treated with Withania extract. Similarly the glutathione (GSH) content in both bladder (1.55 micromol/mg protein) and liver (3.76 micromol/mg protein) was enhanced significantly (P<0.001) in the Withania-treated group compared with the CTX alone-treated animals (bladder 0.5 micromol/mg protein; liver 1.2 micromol/mg protein) Histopathological analysis of the bladder of CTX alone-treated group showed severe necrotic damage where as the Withania somnifera-treated group showed normal bladder architecture.
