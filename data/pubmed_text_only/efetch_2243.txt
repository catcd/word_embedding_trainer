The effects of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker (ARB) on ischemic brain damage induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion were compared with those of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Treatment of male C57BL/6J mice with an ARB, candesartan, reduced the brain ischemic area and neurological deficit after MCA occlusion at a non-hypotensive dose. In contrast, an ACE inhibitor, enalapril, did not reduce the brain ischemic area, and neurological deficit even at a hypotensive dose. Candesartan improved the reduction of brain surface blood flow after MCA occlusion, and inhibited the increase in superoxide production both in the cortex and brain arterial wall at non-hypotensive and hypotensive doses. However, enalapril did not affect the changes in blood flow and superoxide production in the brain after MCA occlusion. AT2 receptor expression in the ischemic area was increased at 3 h after MCA occlusion by pretreatment with candesartan, but not that with enalapril. AT1 receptor expression was neither affected by candesartan nor by enalapril. These results suggest that candesartan attenuated ischemic brain damage, at least partly, through inhibition of oxidative stress.
Treatment options for crescentic glomerulonephritis include the use of steroids, cytotoxic therapy, and, in severe cases, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis. Injury and lysis of capillary glomerular basement membrane, which is made up of type IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans, by serine proteinases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) likely is an important participant in the pathogenesis of crescentic glomerulonephritis. Tetracycline derivatives inhibit not only the activity of MMPs, but also their production, and have been investigated for the treatment of disorders in which the MMP system becomes amplified, such as degenerative osteoarthritis, periodontitis, cancer, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. We report an interesting case of crescentic glomerulonephritis in a young man who was treated with cyclophosphamide and prednisone. The patient developed steroid-induced acne that was treated with long-term oral doxycycline therapy. During the period the patient was administered doxycycline, proteinuria decreased by 70% and recurred when doxycycline was stopped. To our knowledge, this is the first report of possible benefits of a metalloproteinase inhibitor (doxycycline) in glomerulonephritis in humans. Future studies are urgently required to explore the option of metalloproteinase inhibitors in the treatment of proliferative glomerulonephritis.
To determine whether long-term renal sequelae follow the use of furosemide in preterm infants, we evaluated renal function in 27 former very low birth weight infants (less than 1500 gm) at 1 to 2 years of age. Patients were classified into three groups on the basis of status at the time of discharge from the hospital: group 1 (n = 7) had no furosemide treatment or renal calcifications, group 2 (n = 10) had furosemide therapy but no calcifications, and group 3 (n = 10) had furosemide therapy with renal calcifications. Renal ultrasonography at the time of the study demonstrated resolution of the calcifications in six patients in group 3. No differences in renal function were observed between groups 1 and 2. Creatinine clearance (mean +/- SEM) in group 3 (83.6 +/- 7.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2) was significantly lower than clearance in groups 1 and 2 (103.2 +/- 6.5 and 109.1 +/- 5.1, respectively; p less than 0.05). Children in group 3 had significantly higher urinary calcium/creatinine ratios and fractional excretion of sodium and lower tubular reabsorption of phosphate than children in the two other groups had. Urine-blood difference in carbon dioxide tension after oral acetazolamide load, which indicates the ability of the distal tubule to secrete hydrogen ions, was 8.4 +/- 3.4 mm Hg in group 3, significantly lower than values in groups 1 and 2 (22.6 +/- 3.1 and 28.0 +/- 4.3 mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.05). Within group 3 the four children with persistent renal calcifications had significantly lower urine-blood carbon dioxide tension differences than did those with resolution of calcifications (p = 0.02). We conclude that furosemide-related renal calcifications in very low birth weight infants may lead to glomerular and tubular dysfunction; further long-term follow-up of this population is recommended.
N-Nitroso-N-methylaniline (NMA) and N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-fluoroaniline (p-F-NMA), both non-mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium and N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-nitroaniline (p-NO2-NMA), a potent mutagen, were tested for carcinogenicity in F344 rats. NMA was shown to induce a high level of tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the esophagus. Male rats treated with NMA died with tumors at a slightly higher rate than females, although the final tumor yield was the same. Most of the rats treated with p-F-NMA also developed tumors of the esophagus, but they died less rapidly than the NMA treated rats, indicating that p-F-NMA is a slightly weaker carcinogen than NMA. The powerful, directly acting mutagen, p-NO2-NMA did not appear to induce tumors at all since its tumor spectrum was essentially identical to that of the untreated control rats. Thus, the carcinogenic activities of NMA and its substituted analogs do not appear to correlate with bacterial mutagenesis assays. Additionally, NMA, p-F-NMA and N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-bromoaniline, the last a strong mutagen in S. typhimurium, were shown not to induce sister chromatid exchanges in CHO cells and in a clone of a CHO:liver cell hybrid which had previously been shown to be sensitive to chemical agents which require metabolic activation.
Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myocarditis. The imbalance between the occurrence of reactive oxygen species and the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism plays a key role in myocardial injury of viral myocarditis. Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with additional alpha1-adrenergic blocking and antioxidant properties, has been shown to be cardioprotective in experimental myocarditis. However, the expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), the most reliable marker of lipid peroxidation, has not been studied, and the antioxidative effects of carvedilol have not been investigated in the setting of acute viral myocarditis. This study was therefore designed to determine whether levels of lipid peroxides are elevated in the myocardium and whether carvedilol reduces the lipid peroxidation level and increases antioxidant enzyme activities. In a coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis model (Balb/c), effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on 14-day survival rate, myocardial histopathological changes, cardiac function, the expression of 4-HNE, virus titers, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidases (GSH-Px) activities were studied. Lipid peroxidations including 4-HNE and MDA, were elevated in murine coxsackievirus-induced acute viral myocarditis. Carvedilol, but not metoprolol, improved survival, reduced lipid peroxidations including 4-HNE and MDA, and increased antioxidant enzyme activities including SOD and GSH-Px with amelioration of acute viral myocarditis. These results show that carvedilol but not metoprolol exerts some of its beneficial effects by inhibiting peroxidants.
Akathisia due to withdrawal or disruption of antipsychotic treatment is a rare and scarcely elucidated presentation of extrapyramidalism which can also occur after other drug withdrawal. After having reviewed biomedical data basis IME and the latest seven years of MEDLINE and EMBASE, we only found one case, which was published in 1997, of persistent akathisia after risperidone withdrawal, but it had started under treatment with haloperidol. We next present the clinical observation of other two patients who developed akathisia after risperidone withdrawal. In one of them, akathisia started within the first days of treatment at hig-medium doses and got worse after withdrawal; in the other case, akathisia immediately started just after withdrawal of a nine-month treatment with risperidone at low doses.
Osteoporosis is caused by bone resorption in excess of bone formation, and bisphosphonates, are used to inhibit bone resorption. Alendronate, a biphosphonate, is effective for both the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Side effects are relatively few and prominently gastrointestinal. Musculoskeletal pain may be an important side effect in these patients. We presented a patient admitted to our out-patient clinic with diffuse skeletal pain after three consecutive administration of alendronate.
We conclude that patients with osteoporosis can report pain, and bisphosphonate-related pain should also be considered before ascribing this complaint to osteoporosis.
Pregnant and subsequently lactating rats had ad lib access to drinking water which contained either a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 or diazepam (DZ). On the average, the rats consumed 2.9 mg/kg/day of Ro 15-1788 or 5.3 mg/kg/day of diazepam over the time period of 3 weeks, from gestation day 14 through postpartum day 14. The control group consumed equivalent volumes of the drug vehicle in water. While Ro 15-1788 had no apparent toxic effects, the numbers of viable pups in the DZ group were significantly reduced. The mean weight of the viable pups, and their gross behavior were not different in all three groups. However, the fully mature 4.5-month-old male progenies exposed to Ro 15-1788 were much more efficient in the radial arm maze test than the control or the diazepam-exposed animals; they rapidly habituated to the novel environment, their exploratory activity was uninhibited by distracting visual and auditory stimuli, they made fewer "working memory" errors in collecting baits, had a much better control over their emotional responses and the autonomic nervous system, as shown by very low defecation/urination scores, and, at the age of 5 months, they had a significant (66%) increase in the density of benzodiazepine receptors in the hippocampal formation, as compared to the control or the diazepam-exposed progenies. In conclusion, the upregulation of benzodiazepine receptor ontogenesis is retained in adult animals and resulted in improved "working memory" and better control over emotional responses that were particularly evident when the animals were challenged by novel and "intimidating" environmental stimuli.
Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission. However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor. As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor. Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine (a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse. This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800, with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity, involving either drug challenge (ie, amphetamine and MK-801) or transgenic mice (ie, NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)). Results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) mice. In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly, both classical (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity. However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, SSR103800, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.
A 20-year-old male patient on oral treatment with ranitidine 300 mg/day in a single bedtime dose was admitted to hospital for a brief episode of syncope which had occurred 20 min earlier. All clinical, laboratory and instrumental examinations yielded negative findings, except for electrocardiographic evidence of first-degree atrioventricular block. Administration of atropine produced transient disappearance of the block, which disappeared altogether after discontinuing ranitidine treatment. Two separate rechallenges with ranitidine each produced recurrence of (asymptomatic) first-degree atrioventricular block at electrocardiographic examination, but oral treatment with cimetidine (400-800 mg/day) and famotidine (40-80 mg/day) induced no electrocardiographic abnormalities. The hypothesis that this patient may be abnormally susceptible to the cholinergic or cholinergic-like effect of ranitidine, a side effect unrelated to the drug's primary H2-blocking action, would appear to be consistent with evidence of an increased vagal tone of the atrioventricular node as revealed by atrial pacing. However, the ability of ranitidine to release histamine in man and the potential dysrhythmia-inducing effect of histamine should also be taken into consideration.
The epidemiologic case-crossover method is a powerful tool for research on suspected hazards of illegal drug use, the advantage being a subject-as-own-control approach that constrains stable individual-level susceptibility traits. Here, we use the case-crossover method to estimate the magnitude of excess occurrence of panic attacks during months of cocaine use vs. months of no cocaine use, motivated by a prior estimate that cocaine users have three-fold excess risk of panic attack. The self-report data on cocaine and panic are from assessments of a nationally representative sample of 1071 recent panic cases age 18 years or older identified as part of the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse conducted in the United States during 1994-1997. Based on case-crossover estimates, cocaine use is associated with a three- to- four-fold excess occurrence of panic attack (estimated relative risk (RR) = 3.3, p = 0.049; 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 13.7). Year-by-year, the RR estimates from four independent yearly replicates (1994-1997) are 5.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.0. While there are several important limitations, this study adds new evidence about a previously reported suspected causal association linking cocaine use to occurrence of panic attacks, and illustrates advantages of the epidemiologic case-crossover approach and new directions in research on hazards of illegal drug use.
The greatest disadvantage of the halothane, widely used in the anaesthesiology is its ability to cause liver damage. After halothane anaesthesia mild liver enzyme elevation in the one fifth of the patients was detected. The incidence of fatal halothane hepatitis is rare. It depends on several risk factors: on the genetic predisposition, repeated halothane anaesthetics, female sex, age of patient, obesity, intrahepatic hypoxia and enzyme induction. In the pathophysiology of liver toxicity the metabolism of halothane and immune functions play an important role. In this review the last results of researches concerning to the hepatotoxicity of halothane are summarised and the authors call the attention on the opportunity of its effective prevention.
Resveratrol is a natural polyphenolic compound that prevents inflammation in chondrocytes and animal models of osteoarthritis (OA) via yet to be defined mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the protective effect of resveratrol on IL-1β-induced human articular chondrocytes was associated with the TLR4/MyD88/NF-кB signaling pathway by incubating human articular chondrocytes (harvested from osteoarthritis patients) with IL-1β before treatment with resveratrol. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and TNFα levels in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA(Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay). The levels of TLR4 and its downstream signaling targets (MyD88 and TRAF6) and IL-1β were assessed by measuring the levels of mRNA and protein expression by real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively, in addition to assessing NF-кB activation. In addition, TLR4 siRNA was used to block TLR4 expression in chondrocytes further demonstrating that resveratrol prevented IL-1β-mediated inflammation by TLR4 inhibition. We found that resveratrol prevented IL-1β-induced reduction in cell viability. Stimulation of chondrocytes with IL-1β caused a significant up-regulation of TLR4 and its downstream targets MyD88 and TRAF6 resulting in NF-кB activation associated with the synthesis of IL-1β and TNFα. These IL-1β-induced inflammatory responses were all effectively reversed by resveratrol. Furthermore, activation of NF-кB in chondrocytes treated with TLR4 siRNA was significantly attenuated, but not abolished, and exposure to resveratrol further reduced NF-кB translocation. These data suggested that resveratrol prevented IL-1β-induced inflammation in human articular chondrocytes at least in part by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-кB signaling pathway suggesting that resveratrol has the potential to be used as a nutritional supplement to counteract OA symptoms.
To investigate the expression of NF-kappaB and its downstream products in the human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with paraquat.
The HUVEC were cultured in vitro. The activation and location of NF-kappaB P65 protein were detected by immunocytochemical method at 8 h, 24 h and 48 h after treatment with paraquat. The mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-8 were detected by RT-PCR.
Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that the activity subunit of NF-kappaB P65 was located in cytoplasm of normal HUVEC. When the cells were treated with paraquat, positive staining in nuclear was observed. The sum of positive nuclear got more as the paraquat treated time increased. The RT-PCR verified the mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-8 was up-regulated until 48 h after treatment with paraquat.
NF-kappaB could be activated at the early phase of paraquat poisoning. The activated NF-kappaB will induce the synthesis of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-8 and then induce the inflammatory reaction. The inflammatory reaction have participated the tissue damage at the early phase of paraquat poisoning.
The aplastic anemia methimazole induced is a rare event. We describe a case of a woman, affected by hyperthyroidism, who suffers from bone marrow aplasia during Tapazole treatment, and literature has been reviewed. Stopping methimazole and beginning a therapy with methylprednisolone in high dosage, intravenous IgG in high dosage, filgastrin and danatrol, medullary recover after 11 days of treatment is obtained. By analyzing our case and the 12 further cases described, we find that the prognosis of aplastic anemia during the treatment of antithyroid therapy, is rather good. Even if the pathogenetic mechanism of Tapazole induced bone marrow aplasia, it seems to be immuno-mediated in most cases, a direct toxicity in bone marrow cannot be excluded. In examined cases the antithyroid dosage was medium high (mean 40 mg/die). Therefore the use of Tapazole in low doses (15 mg/die) effective in almost all hyperthyroid patient must be considered, when possible, the best therapeutic choice, since it is safer in the incidence of important side effects such as bone marrow aplasia, especially in elderly patients or in patients with chronic renal failure.
Recent epidemiologic studies have suggested that the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor I axis plays an important role in human breast cancer. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the function of GH in rat mammary carcinogenesis, a model that closely recapitulates human breast cancer biology. The Spontaneous Dwarf rat (SDR) arose from the Sprague-Dawley rat and harbors a mutation in its GH gene yielding undetectable levels of a severely truncated protein not capable of binding to the GH receptor. When female rats of either strain were exposed to the direct-acting carcinogen N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, all wild-type rats (n = 10) developed multiple mammary cancers (5.3/rat). In contrast, SDR rats (n = 15) developed only three cancers (0.2/rat) and these were very small (<6 mm3). In another experiment, SDRs were backcrossed with wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats and the progeny were exposed to the indirect-acting carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. Progeny that were either homo- or heterozygous for the wild-type GH gene developed approximately 4 mammary tumors/rat, respectively. In contrast, SDR progeny developed only 0.21 tumors/rat. Mammary glands of SDRs had substantially less alveolar development compared with wild-type, yet ductal branching was similar in the two strains. Infusion of rat GH to SDRs induced mammary epithelial cell proliferation and alveolar development similar to that of wild-type rats. Taken together, these results demonstrate an important role for GH in alveolar development in the virgin rat, and provide the first direct evidence that GH plays a critical role in mammary carcinogenesis.
The initiating mutations of a tumor are present in each of the cancerous cells comprising the tumor. Identification and measurement of the subsequent mutations that occur during tumor progression, however, requires mutation detection in a smaller subset of the tumor cells. In this study, allele-specific competitive blocker PCR (ACB-PCR), a genotypic selection method with the sensitivity to detect a specific point mutation in the presence of a 10(5)-fold excess of wild-type DNA sequence, was used to measure H-ras codon 61 CAA to AAA mutation in mouse liver tumors that did not have this mutation as an initiating event. Twenty-one spontaneous or chemically induced mouse liver tumors, negative for the H-ras codon 61 CAA to AAA mutation by DNA sequencing or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, were analyzed for this mutation by ACB-PCR. The mutation was detected at some level in 71% of these tumors. The mutation was detected in adenomas and carcinomas more frequently (13 of 14 tumors) and at significantly higher mutant fractions than it was detected in histiocytic sarcomas (1 of 5 tumors). These data indicate that the same oncogenic point mutation that can be identified as a tumor-initiating event based on its clonal amplification in a tumor can also be present in only a small sub-population of tumor cells where the mutation must have been fixed at a later stage in tumor development. The occurrence of a mutation as a primary or secondary event probably reflects the stochastic nature of mutation and is likely to be affected by the mutation rate for each target site.
Prostaglandins (PGs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been implicated in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) by facilitating aqueous humor outflow. A possible role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in this process was emphasized by findings showing an impaired COX-2 expression in the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium (NPE) of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. Using human NPE cells, the present study therefore investigated the effect of the IOP-lowering cannabinoid R(+)-methanandamide [R(+)-MA] on the expression of COX-2 and different MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). R(+)-MA led to a concentration- and time-dependent increase of COX-2 mRNA expression. R(+)-MA-induced COX-2 expression was accompanied by time-dependent phosphorylations of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p42/44 MAPK and was abrogated by inhibitors of both pathways. Moreover, R(+)-MA increased the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 but not that of MMP-2 and TIMP-2. Inhibition of COX-2 activity with NS-398 [N-[2-(cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide] was associated with a virtually complete suppression of R(+)-MA-induced MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression. Consistent with these data, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression was also induced by PGE2, a major COX-2 product. Two other COX-2-inducing cannabinoids, anandamide and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, caused the same pattern of MMP and TIMP expression as R(+)-MA both in the absence and presence of NS-398. Altogether, cannabinoids induce the production of several outflow-facilitating mediators in the human NPE. Our results further imply an involvement of COX-2-dependent PGs in MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression. In conclusion, stimulation of intraocular COX-2 and MMP expression may represent a potential mechanism contributing to the IOP-lowering action of different cannabinoids.
Nifedipine induces vascular smooth muscle relaxation through a calcium antagonistic action. The possibility of clinical use of the drug as a ventricular unloading agent has been explored in this study. In patients with hypertensive (seven cases), primary (seven cases) or rheumatic (aortic insufficiency five cases, mitral regurgitation five cases) cardiac disease, nifedipine, administered in a single sublingual dose (10 mg), relieved acute pulmonary edema. Circulatory variations from control were the following: decrease of systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, and of vascular resistances, of pulmonary wedge pressure, of left ventricular diastolic and systolic dimensions (echocardiography); increase of cardiac and stroke index, of left ventricular mean rate of circumferential fiber shortening, of left and right mean pre-ejection delta P/delta t and mean rate of ejection; improvement of forward output in primary and rheumatic disease. Nifedipine benefits acute congestive heart failure by sustained fall of both preload and afterload and, possibly, by an enhanced contractility. It seems to have an appropriate indication in cases in which left ventricular afterload reduction is desirable.
In drug-naive rats, the rewarding effects of morphine are blocked by lesions of the tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP), but not by neuroleptics. In dependent rats (chronically treated with morphine), morphine reward is blocked by neuroleptics, but not by TPP lesions. Just as this activation of opiate receptors in naive versus dependent rats produces different mechanisms of reward, this study concludes that reduced opioid activity on these opiate receptors produces different mechanisms of aversion. Neuroleptics blocked the conditioned place aversions produced by naloxone and spontaneous withdrawal in morphine dependent, but not naive, rats, without attenuating the somatic withdrawal syndrome induced by naloxone in dependent rats. The researchers suggest that the aversive effects of endogenous opioid withdrawal in naive rats are mediated by different neural substrates than the aversive effects of exogenous opioid withdrawal in dependent rats.
Nicotine [3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-pyridine], a major alkaloid in tobacco, has been implicated as playing a role in carcinogenesis. Our previous study showed that passive cigarette smoking promoted inflammation-associated colonic adenoma formation in mice, and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) plays an important role in this process. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether nicotine could stimulate colon cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in nude mice xenograft model and the possible mechanisms involved. Results showed that nicotine stimulated SW1116 colon cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Src phosphorylation levels together with protein expression of 5-LOX were also significantly enhanced in this proliferation process. Inhibitors of EGFR and c-Src alleviated the actions of nicotine on cell proliferation and 5-LOX protein expression. Combination of both agents produced additive effect. In contrast, 5-LOX inhibitor had no direct effect on the phosphorylation levels of EGFR and c-Src and yet inhibited cell proliferation. In the colon cancer xenograft model, nicotine also significantly enhanced tumor growth. This acceleration of tumor growth corresponded well with increased vascularization and its proangiogenic factors. Inhibitors of EGFR, c-Src, and 5-LOX all significantly impeded the tumor growth induced by nicotine. Together, nicotine can promote colonic tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Activation of the phosphorylated form of EGFR and c-Src followed by an increased 5-LOX expression are the prime pathogenic mechanisms in the tumorigenic process in the colon.
We administered secretin intravenously to 14 patients with autism (9 to 14 years, 10 males; 4 females), and evaluated its clinical effect. We also measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxy-indole-3-acetic acid (5HIAA) before and after 4 weeks treatment, and compared them with the grade of improvement of the clinical symptoms assessed by the scores of Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). After injection of secretin, the ADI-R score increased in 8 patients, but declined in 3. Improvement was observed in functions such as sociability (interpersonal relationships), communication and speech improved, whereas in the others. symptoms such as hyperkinesias and stereotyped behavior became worse. The CSF levels of HVA was significantly increased in all of the patients showing an improvement in the ADI-R score. SHIAA levels also tended to increase, although this increase was not significant. These findings suggest that secretin promotes the metabolism of serotonin and dopamine in the central nervous system, which may contribute to improvement in clinical symptoms of autism.
The response to diazepam and propranolol hydrochloride was compared in 21 patients who (with one exception) met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia. Each drug was administered for two weeks in double-blind fashion according to a crossover design. The response to diazepam was significantly superior on all measures. By observer rating, 18 patients showed at least moderate improvement with diazepam compared with seven receiving propranolol. Panic attacks and phobic symptoms responded to diazepam, but not to propranolol. The results suggest that benzodiazepines constitute effective short-term treatment for these newly defined disorders.
The use of antiepileptic drugs during human gestation probably increases the risk of causing CNS disorders in later life. In brain, granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and cerebellum are still developing in the last trimester of human gestation and a similar development is taking place during the mouse perinatal period. We treated newborn C57BL/6 mice orally with 35 mg/kg phenytoin (PHT) daily during postnatal days (PD) 5 to 14. Histopathological investigation revealed that the layer of mature granule cells in the DG that was immunoreactive to anti-calbindin D28k was thinner in PHT-treated mice. Purkinje cells in the treated group also had poor, immature arbors with an irregular arrangement. A number of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the DG and cerebellum during the treatment. PHT-treated mice were impaired in the acquisition of a hidden platform task in the water maze and committed significantly more errors during the learning process in theradial arm maze. These findings demonstrate that neonatal administration of PHT interferes with the development of granule cells in the hippocampus and the cerebellum and causes spatial leaning deficits in later life. Cautious clinical use of this drug for pregnant patients is warranted, especially in the last trimester.
The medical management of rosacea increasingly has involved not only the appropriate selection of topical medication but also patient education and specific recommendations regarding appropriate skin care. The recognition that epidermal barrier dysfunction and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) play a pathophysiologic role in rosacea and that skin moisturization may help to mitigate signs and symptoms of the disease has led to a deeper appreciation of the importance of proper skin care in the treatment of rosacea. Data from a percutaneous penetration study performed using human skin suggest that any of the tested moisturizer lotions may be applied either before or after azelaic acid gel 15% without a major change in the percutaneous absorption profile of azelaic acid.
