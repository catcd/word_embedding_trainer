A case of primary vascular pulmonary hypertension (PVPH) in a 53-year old woman (160 cm, 90 kg) is reported. She first complained of symptoms of breathlessness on exertion 2-3 months after completion of three courses of fenfluramine (Ponderax). The courses began in October 1977 and ended in May 1978. Despite persisting symptoms no relevant clinical findings were obtained. The patient was admitted to this hospital after complaining of short syncopal attacks on exertion, in November 1981. Typical signs of PVPH were now demonstrable, with a resting pulmonary pressure of 98/45 mm Hg. Clinical findings showed a similarity to those obtained in patients suffering from aminorex-induced PVPH, although fenfluramine shows some biological differences to aminorex. A causality between the development of PVPH and fenfluramine intake is probable on the basis of the patient's history, but it cannot be proven.
Cough mixture abuse has been reported to cause severe folate deficiency and neurological defects. We carried out a prospective case-controlled survey to confirm this association and define the incidence and severity of the problem. A total of 57 cough mixture abusers and 47 other substance abusers (controls) were studied. When compared with controls, cough mixture abusers had a high incidence of low folate levels that could only be detected by screening.
A clinically employed antihyperlipidemic drug, bezafibrate, has been characterized as a PPAR(alpha, -gamma, and -delta) pan-agonist in vitro. Recent extended trials have highlighted its antidiabetic properties in humans. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated. The present study was designed to explore potential regulatory mechanisms of intracellular glucocorticoid reactivating enzyme, 11beta-HSD1 and anti-diabetic hormone, adiponectin by bezafibrate in murine adipose tissue, and cultured adipocytes. Treatment of db/db mice with bezafibrate significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, accompanied by a marked reduction of triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acids. Despite equipotent in lipid-lowering effects, another fibrate, fenofibrate, did not show such beneficial effects on glycemic control. Treatment of bezafibrate caused a marked decrease in the mRNA level of 11beta-HSD1 preferentially in adipose tissue of db/db mice (-47%, P<0.05), concomitant with a significant increase in plasma adiponectin level (+37%, P<0.01). Notably, treatment of bezafibrate caused a marked decrease in the mRNA level (-34%, P<0.01) and enzyme activity (-32%, P<0.01) of 11beta-HSD1, whereas the treatment substantially augmented the expression (+71%, P<0.01) and secretion (+27%, P<0.01) of adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Knockdown of 11beta-HSD1 by siRNA confirmed that 11beta-HSD1 acts as a distinct oxoreductase in adipocytes and validated the enzyme activity assays in the present study. Effects of bezafibrate on regulation of 11beta-HSD1 and adiponectin in murine adipocytes were comparable with those in thiazolidinediones. This is the first demonstration that bezafibrate directly regulates 11beta-HSD1 and adiponectin in murine adipocytes, both of which may contribute to metabolically-beneficial effects by bezafibrate.
Linalool, a natural small molecule monoterpene, has been shown to have anti-tumor activity against several human tumor cell lines in vitro; however, the anti-leukemia spectrum and molecular mechanisms inhibiting tumor cell growth are not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that linalool preferentially induced growth arrest and apoptosis of a variety of human leukemia cells, but spared normal hematopoietic cells. Treatment of leukemia cells by linalool for 12h led to strong activation of p53, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), GADD45alpha, c-jun and phosphorylated-JNK, suggesting that linalool-induced apoptosis might be associated with activation of p53 and CDKIs. The findings here warrant further investigation of this class of natural product as lead compound for developing novel therapeutic agents for leukemia.
Increased hepatotoxicity of methotrexate has been reported during dexamethasone therapy in humans. Despite the observed inducing effect of dexamethasone on some methotrexate transporting proteins in the liver, the kinetic aspects of this interaction have not been studied yet. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of dexamethasone on the hepatic and overall pharmacokinetics of methotrexate. Pharmacokinetics of methotrexate was evaluated in rats during an in vivo steady-state clearance study after either single intravenous dose of dexamethasone or its four-day oral administration in a dose optimized for transport proteins induction. Dexamethasone oral pretreatment reduced biliary clearance of methotrexate by 53%. Although liver tissue concentration of methotrexate increased only slightly in these animals, a significant increase in liver weights produced by dexamethasone pretreatment revealed a marked increase in liver content of the drug. An evaluation of plasma liver enzyme activities measured before and after methotrexate administration demonstrated a potentiation of corticosteroid hepatotoxicity by the cytostatic. Analysis of methotrexate transporter expression in the liver showed up-regulation of Mrp2, Oatp1a4, and Oat2, and down-regulation of Mrp3. These observations comply with increased biliary excretion and reduced plasma concentrations of their endogenous substrate, conjugated bilirubin. In contrast, single intravenous bolus of dexamethasone did not influence any pharmacokinetic parameter of methotrexate. In conclusion, these results indicate that hepatocellular impairment associated with reduced biliary elimination of methotrexate, and its raised liver content may contribute to increased hepatotoxicity of the drug when co-administered with dexamethasone. Moreover, an influence of dexamethasone on protein expression of anionic drugs transporters in the liver and kidney was demonstrated.
Acetaminophen (APAP) causes acute and chronic renal failure. The mechanisms leading to hepatic injury have been extensively studied, but the molecular mechanisms regarding APAP-induced nephro-toxicity are poorly defined. In earlier studies, we have demonstrated that arjunolic acid (AA) possesses protective roles against chemically induced organ pathophysiology. The purpose of the present study was to explore whether AA plays any protective role against APAP induced acute renal toxicity; and if so, what pathways it utilizes for the mechanism of its protective action. Exposure of rats with a nephro-toxic dose of APAP altered a number of biomarkers (like blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, etc.) related to renal oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant activity, elevated renal tumor necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide levels. AA treatment both pre- and post to APAP exposure protected the alteration of these biomarkers, compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms, and suppressed lipid peroxidation in renal tissue. Investigating the inherent molecular signaling of this pathophysiology and its protection, we found that the mitochondrial pathway was not activated during APAP-induced cell death as no dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential or release of cytochrome C was detected in the respective experiments. Our experimental evidence suggests that APAP-induced nephro-toxicity is a caspase-dependent process that involves activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the absence of cytosolic cytochrome C release. These results provide evidence that inhibition of NO overproduction and maintenance of intracellular antioxidant status may play a pivotal role in the protective effects of AA against APAP-induced renal damage. AA represents a potential therapeutic option to protect renal tissue from the detrimental effects of acute acetaminophen overdose.
Proteinuria caused by glomerular disease is characterized by podocyte injury. Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists are effective in reducing albuminuria, although their actions on glomerular podocytes have not been explored. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of tolvaptan, a selective oral V2 receptor antagonist, on podocytes in a puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrosis rat model.
Rats were allocated to a control, PAN nephrosis, or tolvaptan-treated PAN nephrosis group (n = 9 per group). Urinary protein excretion and serum levels of total protein, albumin, creatinine, and total cholesterol were measured on day 10. The influence of tolvaptan on podocytes was examined in renal tissues by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy.
PAN induced massive proteinuria and serum creatinine elevation on day 10, both of which were significantly ameliorated by tolvaptan. Immunofluorescence studies of the podocyte-associated proteins nephrin and podocin revealed granular staining patterns in PAN nephrosis rats. In tolvaptan-treated rats, nephrin and podocin expressions retained their normal linear pattern. Electron microscopy showed foot process effacement was ameliorated in tolvaptan-treated rats.
Tolvaptan is protective against podocyte damage and proteinuria in PAN nephrosis. This study indicates that tolvaptan exerts a renoprotective effect by affecting podocyte morphology and probably function in PAN nephrosis. Tolvaptan is a promising pharmacological tool in the treatment of renal edema.
Recently, we have described the beneficial effects of Diphenyl diselenide, an organochalcogen with glutathione peroxidase-like activity, on reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia in old rats. In this study, our aim was to examine the effects of diselenide on haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia in rats. Male wistar rats received one single dose of Haloperidol decanoate (57 mg/kg/im) or control. After this dose, the animals received daily administration of diphenyl diselenide (1, 5 or 10 mg/kg/sc) or control, during 28 days. Twenty-four hours after the last diselenide or control solution injection, all the rats were observed for quantification of oral dyskinesia through the frequency of vacuous chewing movements (VCM) and tongue protrusion (TP) and the duration of facial twitching (FT). Haloperidol caused a significant increase in VCM, TP and FT observed in the 4 weekly evaluations (p<0.05). The co-administration of diselenide (5 mg/kg) reversed this effect for all the parameters in four behavioral sessions. The results of the present study demonstrate the possible protective activity of diphenyl diselenide on haloperidol-induced orofacial diskinesia. This effect is in accordance to the involvement of neurotoxicity in orofacial dyskinesia and suggest that studies be continued with new antioxidant compounds.
Behçet's disease is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by four major manifestations: recurrent ocular symptoms, oral and genital ulcers and skin lesions. We conducted a genome-wide association study in a Japanese cohort including 612 individuals with Behçet's disease and 740 unaffected individuals (controls). We identified two suggestive associations on chromosomes 1p31.3 (IL23R-IL12RB2, rs12119179, P = 2.7 x 10(-8)) and 1q32.1 (IL10, rs1554286, P = 8.0 x 10(-8)). A meta-analysis of these two loci with results from additional Turkish and Korean cohorts showed genome-wide significant associations (rs1495965 in IL23R-IL12RB2, P = 1.9 x 10(-11), odds ratio = 1.35; rs1800871 in IL10, P = 1.0 x 10(-14), odds ratio = 1.45).
Behçet's disease is a genetically complex disease of unknown etiology characterized by recurrent inflammatory attacks affecting the orogenital mucosa, eyes and skin. We performed a genome-wide association study with 311,459 SNPs in 1,215 individuals with Behçet's disease (cases) and 1,278 healthy controls from Turkey. We confirmed the known association of Behçet's disease with HLA-B*51 and identified a second, independent association within the MHC Class I region. We also identified an association at IL10 (rs1518111, P = 1.88 x 10(-8)). Using a meta-analysis with an additional five cohorts from Turkey, the Middle East, Europe and Asia, comprising a total of 2,430 cases and 2,660 controls, we identified associations at IL10 (rs1518111, P = 3.54 x 10(-18), odds ratio = 1.45, 95% CI 1.34-1.58) and the IL23R-IL12RB2 locus (rs924080, P = 6.69 x 10(-9), OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39). The disease-associated IL10 variant (the rs1518111 A allele) was associated with diminished mRNA expression and low protein production.
The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol and the Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan on cognitive function in very elderly hypertensive patients. A total of 120 mild to moderate essential hypertensive (DBP >90 and <105 mmHg) patients, aged 75-89 years, were studied. After a 4-week wash-out period on placebo, they were randomized to receive atenolol 50 mg or losartan 50 mg for 24 weeks according to a parallel arm design. At the end of the placebo period and of each active treatment period, BP was measured (by mercury sphygmomanometer, Korotkoff I and V) and cognitive function was evaluated through three different tests (word list memory, word list recall and word list fluency). Both atenolol and losartan were equally effective in reducing SBP (-22.1 and -23.1 mmHg, respectively, P< 0.01 vs baseline) and DBP (-10.3 and -11.2 mmHg, respectively, P< 0.01 vs baseline). Atenolol treatment did not induce significant changes in any test score, whereas losartan significantly increased the score of both the word list memory (+2.2, P<0.05 vs baseline) and the word list recall test (+2.1, P<0.05 vs baseline). The comparison between losartan and atenolol was significant (P<0.05) for both memory tests. These data suggest that in very elderly hypertensive patients, chronic AT1 receptor blockade by losartan could improve cognitive function, in particular immediate and delayed memory.
Streptococcus pyogenes of the M1 serotype can cause streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and acute lung injury. Statins exert beneficial effects in septic patients although the mechanisms remain elusive. This study examined effects of simvastatin on M1 protein-provoked pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with simvastatin or a CXCR2 antagonist before M1 protein challenge. Bronchoalveolar fluid and lung tissue were harvested for determination of neutrophil infiltration, formation of edema, and CXC chemokines. Flow cytometry was used to determine Mac-1 expression on neutrophils. Gene expression of CXC chemokines was determined in alveolar macrophages by using quantitative RT-PCR. M1 protein challenge caused massive infiltration of neutrophils, edema formation, and production of CXC chemokines in the lung as well as upregulation of Mac-1 on circulating neutrophils. Simvastatin reduced M1 protein-induced infiltration of neutrophils and edema in the lung. In addition, M1 protein-induced Mac-1 expression on neutrophils was abolished by simvastatin. Furthermore, simvastatin markedly decreased pulmonary formation of CXC chemokines and gene expression of CXC chemokines in alveolar macrophages. Moreover, the CXCR2 antagonist reduced M1 protein-induced neutrophil expression of Mac-1 and accumulation of neutrophils as well as edema formation in the lung. These novel findings indicate that simvastatin is a powerful inhibitor of neutrophil infiltration in acute lung damage triggered by streptococcal M1 protein. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on M1 protein-induced neutrophil recruitment appears related to reduced pulmonary generation of CXC chemokines. Thus, simvastatin may be a useful tool to ameliorate acute lung injury in streptococcal infections.
Lead exposure increases blood pressure (BP) by unknown mechanisms. Many recent studies have shown the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in hypertension, particularly MMP-2. In this work, we have examined whether MMP-2 levels increase with lead-induced increase in BP. We have also investigated whether doxycycline (an MMP inhibitor) affects these alterations. To this end, rats were exposed to lead (90 ppm) and treated with doxycycline or vehicle for 8 weeks. Similar aortic and whole blood lead levels were found in lead-exposed rats treated with either doxycycline or vehicle. Lead-induced increases in BP and aortic MMP-2 levels (activity, protein, and mRNA) were blunted by doxycycline. Doxycycline also prevented lead-induced increases in the MMP-2/TIMP-2 mRNA ratio. No significant changes in vascular reactivity or morphometric parameters were found. In conclusion, lead exposure increases BP and vascular MMP-2, which is blunted by doxycycline. This observation suggests that MMP-2 may play a role in lead-induced increases in BP.
Doxorubicin-induced renal toxicity overshadows its anticancer effectiveness. This study is aimed at assessing the possible modulator effects of meloxicam, a cyclooxigenase-2 inhibitor, on doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice and exploring some of the modulator mechanisms. Forty male mice were divided for treatment, for 2 weeks, with saline, meloxicam (daily), doxorubicin (twice/week), or both meloxicam and doxorubicin. Doxorubicin induced a significant increase in relative kidney weight to body weight, kidney lipid perooxidation, plasma levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, kidney caspase-3 activity, and kidney prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) content. Doxorubicin disturbed kidney histology, abrogated renal function tests (serum creatinine, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen), induced a significant decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. The administration of meloxicam with doxorubicin mitigated all doxorubicin-disturbed parameters. Meloxicam ameliorated doxorubicin-induced renal injury via inhibition of inflammatory PGE2, inflammatory cytokines, caspase-3 activity, antioxidant effect, and free radical scavenging activity.
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of phenolic extract and purified hydroxytyrosol (HT) from olive mill waste (OMW) on oxidative stress and hyperglycemia in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The OMW biophenols were extracted using ethyl acetate. The obtained extract was fractionated by solid phase extraction (SPE) experimentation to generate two fractions: (F1) and (F2). HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS analysis showed that (F1) was made of known OMW monomeric phenolics mainly hydroxytyrosol (HT) while (F2) contained oligomeric and polymeric phenols such as verbascosid and ligstrosid. (HT) was purified from (F1) using silica gel-column chromatography and silica gel-TLC techniques. In incubated pancreas, supplementation of OMW fractions enhanced insulin secretion. The administration of OMW extract fractions (F1) and (F2) as well as purified (HT) in diabetic rats caused a decrease in glucose level in plasma and an increase in renal superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities in liver and kidney. Furthermore, a protective action against hepatic and renal toxicity in diabetic rats was clearly observed. Furthermore, a significant decrease in hepatic and renal indices toxicity was observed, i.e. alkalines phosphatases (ALP), aspartate and lactate transaminases (AST and ALT) activities and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs), total and direct bilirubin, creatinine and urea levels. In addition, (F1), (F2) and especially (HT) decreased triglycerides (TG), total-cholesterol (T-Ch) and higher HDL-cholesterol (HDL-Ch) in serum. These beneficial effects of OMW biophenols were confirmed by histological findings in hepatic, renal and pancreatic tissues of diabetic rats. This study demonstrates for the first time that OMW polyphenols and especially (HT) are efficient in inhibiting hyperglycemia and oxidative stress induced by diabetes and suggests that administration of HT may be helpful in the prevention of diabetic complications associated with oxidative stress.
We report the case of a 19-year old black West Indian woman who had been treated for acne for two years with oral minocycline (50 mg per day) and topical of benzoyle peroxide (5%). She was admitted for fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia and widespread pruritus. We observed several skin lesions of hyperpigmentation, biological signs of hepatitis, and significant levels of antinuclear, anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Minocycline was immediately stopped. Two months later, all of the biological abnormalities had disappeared but the skin lesions seemed to be irreversible. Minocycline is largely used for the treatment of acne and may induce severe immuno-allergic reactions. Several cases of induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity syndrome, serum-sickness-like illness and Sweet's syndrome have already been described. These side effects are rare but may be life-threatening. So, minocycline should be used as a second-line treatment for acne and should be avoided in black people whom seem to be at risk of such reactions. If, despite those precautions, minocycline-induced immuno-allergic reactions occur, the treatment should be immediately stopped and never prescribed again.
We describe 3 patients with a prolonged history of hypercalcemia. The patients did not take any vitamin supplements. All patients had low parathyroid hormone (PTH), high calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D3), and high angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blood levels. There was no evidence of sarcoidosis of any other underlying disease in the results of an extensive workup. Treatment with prednisone resulted in normalization of calcium levels in all patients. They remained dependent on low-dose prednisone on a subsequent prolonged follow-up.
A 50-y-old Caucasian female inadvertantly received 30 ml of 89% phenol (26.9 g, 0.44 g/kg bw) [corrected]. At 23 min post-injection the patient was unresponsive and in shock. By 4 h post-injection she required large doses of vasopressors. At 4.5 h, charcoal hemoperfusion (CHP) was begun and she received that for 6 h and 20 min. Her clinical status improved during the CHP and she made a complete recovery. Phenol levels drawn prior to and after the procedure correlated her recovery with the improving phenol levels. CHP appears to have efficacy in severe acute phenol intoxication.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has a complex pathogenesis involving both heart and lungs. Animal models can reflect aspects of the human pathology and provide insights into the development and underlying mechanisms of disease. Because of the variability of most animal models of PAH, serial in vivo measurements of cardiopulmonary function, morphology, and markers of pathology can enhance the value of such studies. Therefore, quantitative in vivo SPECT/CT imaging was performed to assess cardiac function, morphology and cardiac perfusion utilizing (201)Thallium ((201)Tl) in control and monocrotaline-treated rats. In addition, lung and heart apoptosis was examined with (99m)Tc-Annexin V ((99m)Tc-Annexin) in these cohorts. Following baseline imaging, rats were injected with saline or monocrotaline (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and imaged weekly for 6 weeks. To assess a therapeutic response in an established pulmonary hypertensive state, a cohort of rats received resveratrol in drinking water (3 mg/kg/day) on days 28-42 post-monocrotaline injection to monitor regression of cardiopulmonary apoptosis. PAH in monocrotaline-treated rats was verified by conventional hemodynamic techniques on day 42 (right ventricular systolic pressure (RSVP) = 66.2 mmHg in monocrotaline vs 28.8 mmHg in controls) and in terms of right ventricular hypertrophy (RV/LVS = 0.70 in monocrotaline vs 0.32 in controls). Resveratrol partially reversed both RVSP (41.4 mmHg) and RV/LVS (0.46), as well as lung edema and RV contractility +dP/dt(max). Serial (99m)Tc-Annexin V imaging showed clear increases in pulmonary and cardiac apoptosis when compared to baseline, which regressed following resveratrol treatment. Monocrotaline induced modest changes in whole-heart perfusion as assessed by (201)TI imaging and cardiac morphological changes consistent with septal deviation and enlarged RV. This study demonstrates the utility of functional in vivo SPECT/CT imaging in rodent models of PAH and further confirms the efficacy of resveratrol in reversing established monocrotaline-induced PAH presumably by attenuation of cardiopulmonary apoptosis.
Studies on the lipid peroxidation and antioxidant changes and their significance during myocardial injury have provided a new insight into the pathogenesis of heart disease. The heart failure subsequent to myocardial infarction may be associated with an antioxidant deficit as well as increased myocardial oxidative stress. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of the combination of ferulic acid and ascorbic acid on antioxidant defense system and lipid peroxidation against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Induction of rats with isoproterenol (150 mg/kg body weight daily, i.p.) for 2 days resulted in a marked elevation in lipid peroxidation, serum marker enzymes (LDH, CPK, GOT, and GPT), and a significant decrease in activities of endogenous antioxidants (SOD, GPx, GST, CAT, and GSH). Pre-co-treatment with the combination of ferulic acid (20 mg/kg body weight/day) and ascorbic acid (80 mg/kg body weight/day) orally for 6 days, significantly attenuated these changes when compared to the individual treatment groups. Histopathological observations were also in correlation with the biochemical parameters. Thus, ferulic acid and ascorbic acid significantly counteracted the pronounced oxidative stress effect of ISO by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, restoration of antioxidant status, and myocardial marker enzymes levels. In conclusion, these findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of ferulic acid and ascorbic acid on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense system during ISO-induced myocardial infarction and associated oxidative stress in rats.
A novel Annonaceous acetogenin, montanacin F, with a new type of terminal lactone unit, was isolated from the leaves of Annona montana. Its structure was determined on the basis of spectral evidences and chemical methods, and a possible biosynthetic pathway was discussed. In addition, the cytotoxicity of montanacin F was evaluated in vitro against Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor cell lines. Furthermore, the previously isolated cytotoxic acetogenin annonacin against LLC was examined for in vivo antitumor activity with LLC tumor cells.
We report a case of a peripheral neuropathy induced and exacerbated by several commonly used HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors including lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, and the vitamin niacin. A review of the literature shows similar cases with individual lipid-lowering drugs, but this case shows the cross-reactivity of the neuropathic process to different HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and it is the first reported case of a peripheral neuropathy exacerbated by the use of niacin.
Bosentan, an oral ET(A)/ET(B) receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, some patients discontinue bosentan because of hepatotoxicity or inadequate efficacy. Sitaxsentan, an oral, ET(A)-selective endothelin antagonist currently under investigation, may be an alternative treatment option. In this study we evaluate the safety and efficacy of sitaxsentan in patients discontinuing bosentan.
Forty-eight patients with idiopathic PAH or PAH associated with connective-tissue disease or congenital heart disease were randomized (double-blind) to a single daily dose of either 50 mg or 100 mg sitaxsentan. Thirty-five of the 48 patients discontinued bosentan because of inadequate efficacy, as judged by the investigator, and 13 discontinued bosentan for safety concerns. Study end-points included change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), change in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class, time to clinical worsening, and change in Borg dyspnea score (Borg) from baseline to Week 12.
With 100 mg sitaxsentan, 5 of 15 patients (33%) who discontinued bosentan because inadequate efficacy improved, demonstrating a >15% increase in 6MWD, vs 2 of 20 patients (10%) treated with 50 mg sitaxsentan. Fifteen percent and 20% of these patients had a >15% decrease in 6MWD in the 50- and 100-mg groups, respectively. Similar results were seen for the Borg and WHO functional class. Of the 12 patients discontinuing bosentan because of hepatotoxicity, 1 developed elevated liver enzymes at 13 weeks of sitaxsentan therapy. Overall, sitaxsentan was well tolerated.
Sitaxsentan may represent a safe and efficacious alternative endothelin receptor antagonist for patients discontinuing bosentan.
We performed a genome-wide association study on 1,292 individuals with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and 30,503 controls from Iceland and The Netherlands, with a follow-up of top markers in up to 3,267 individuals with AAAs and 7,451 controls. The A allele of rs7025486 on 9q33 was found to associate with AAA, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 and P = 4.6 x 10(-10). In tests for association with other vascular diseases, we found that rs7025486[A] is associated with early onset myocardial infarction (OR = 1.18, P = 3.1 x 10(-5)), peripheral arterial disease (OR = 1.14, P = 3.9 x 10(-5)) and pulmonary embolism (OR = 1.20, P = 0.00030), but not with intracranial aneurysm or ischemic stroke. No association was observed between rs7025486[A] and common risk factors for arterial and venous diseases-that is, smoking, lipid levels, obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Rs7025486 is located within DAB2IP, which encodes an inhibitor of cell growth and survival.
Tungsten alloys are composed of tungsten microparticles embedded in a solid matrix of transition metals such as nickel, cobalt, or iron. To understand the toxicology of these alloys, male F344 rats were intramuscularly implanted with pellets of tungsten/nickel/cobalt, tungsten/nickel/iron, or pure tungsten, with tantalum pellets as a negative control. Between 6 and 12 months, aggressive rhabdomyosarcomas formed around tungsten/nickel/cobalt pellets, while those of tungsten/nickel/iron or pure tungsten did not cause cancers. Electron microscopy showed a progressive corrosion of the matrix phase of tungsten/nickel/cobalt pellets over 6 months, accompanied by high urinary concentrations of nickel and cobalt. In contrast, non-carcinogenic tungsten/nickel/iron pellets were minimally corroded and urinary metals were low; these pellets having developed a surface oxide layer in vivo that may have restricted the mobilization of carcinogenic nickel. Microarray analysis of tumors revealed large changes in gene expression compared with normal muscle, with biological processes involving the cell cycle significantly up-regulated and those involved with muscle development and differentiation significantly down-regulated. Top KEGG pathways disrupted were adherens junction, p53 signaling, and the cell cycle. Chromosomal enrichment analysis of genes showed a highly significant impact at cytoband 7q22 (chromosome 7) which included mouse double minute (MDM2) and cyclin-dependant kinase (CDK4) as well as other genes associated with human sarcomas. In conclusion, the tumorigenic potential of implanted tungsten alloys is related to mobilization of carcinogenic metals nickel and cobalt from corroding pellets, while gene expression changes in the consequent tumors are similar to radiation induced animal sarcomas as well as sporadic human sarcomas.
