These studies were designed to determine whether ritonavir inhibits breast cancer in vitro and in vivo and, if so, how.
Ritonavir effects on breast cancer cell growth were studied in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive lines MCF7 and T47D and in the ER-negative lines MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-231. Effects of ritonavir on Rb-regulated and Akt-mediated cell proliferation were studied. Ritonavir was tested for inhibition of a mammary carcinoma xenograft.
ER-positive estradiol-dependent lines (IC50, 12-24 micromol/L) and ER-negative (IC50, 45 micromol/L) lines exhibit ritonavir sensitivity. Ritonavir depletes ER-alpha levels notably in ER-positive lines. Ritonavir causes G1 arrest, depletes cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4, and 6 and cyclin D1 but not cyclin E, and depletes phosphorylated Rb and Ser473 Akt. Ritonavir induces apoptosis independent of G1 arrest, inhibiting growth of cells that have passed the G1 checkpoint. Myristoyl-Akt, but not activated K-Ras, rescues ritonavir inhibition. Ritonavir inhibited a MDA-MB-231 xenograft and intratumoral Akt activity at a clinically attainable serum Cmax of 22 +/- 8 micromol/L. Because heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) substrates are depleted by ritonavir, ritonavir effects on Hsp90 were tested. Ritonavir binds Hsp90 (K(D), 7.8 micromol/L) and partially inhibits its chaperone function. Ritonavir blocks association of Hsp90 with Akt and, with sustained exposure, notably depletes Hsp90. Stably expressed Hsp90alpha short hairpin RNA also depletes Hsp90, inhibiting proliferation and sensitizing breast cancer cells to low ritonavir concentrations.
Ritonavir inhibits breast cancer growth in part by inhibiting Hsp90 substrates, including Akt. Ritonavir may be of interest for breast cancer therapeutics and its efficacy may be increased by sustained exposure or Hsp90 RNA interference.
Adenosine is an endogenously produced substance which in animal experiments exerts anti-nociceptive effects. In humans, algesic effects have been presented following exogenous adenosine administration. A recent study on anaesthetized patients, however, suggested an anti-nociceptive effect during i.v. adenosine. We have studied the pain-reducing effect in healthy volunteers using adenosine 50-80 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (n = 10), morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 (n = 5), adenosine 50 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 + morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 (n = 6), and ketamine 0.1 mg.kg-1 (n = 5); all drugs given i.v., single-blind. Quantitative sensory tests (QST) revealed a significantly increased cutaneous heat pain threshold following adenosine. No effect was seen following ketamine or morphine. Suprathreshold heat pain perception was unchanged in all subjects. Furthermore, warm and cold perception thresholds were not influenced significantly by any drug. Adenosine, morphine and ketamine produced well-known side-effects but of a mild intensity not necessitating any treatment. The present results show that i.v. adenosine can provide a modest but selective increase of cutaneous heat pain thresholds, suggesting a pain-reducing capacity of adenosine in humans.
Mild hypothermia prevents the development of brain edema in rats with acute liver failure resulting from hepatic devascularization. Mechanistic studies performed in this model suggest that the protective effect of hypothermia results from the inhibition of blood-brain transfer of ammonia, an action which could result (at least in part) from an effect on cerebral blood flow. Hypothermia-induced reductions of brain ammonia are associated with normalization of extracellular brain glutamate concentrations in rats with acute liver failure. Studies in humans suggest that mild hypothermia is beneficial in the management of severely raised intracranial pressure, both before and after liver transplantation in patients with acute liver failure due to acetaminophen overdose. Mild hypothermia offers a potentially useful bridge therapy in patients with acute liver failure who are awaiting liver transplantation.
Tetrandrine, the active principle of Stephania tetrandra radix extracts, has broad pharmacological activity, including effects on the cardiovascular system: it has been shown to reduce the size of acute myocardial infarction in rats undergoing coronary vessel ligation and to improve heart lesions in the constriction/reperfusion model by means of mechanisms involving peroxidation, calcium antagonism and coagulation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether tetrandrine has anti-infarction, antioxidant and anticoagulant effects in rabbits treated with isoproterenol, a drug capable of causing peroxide generation, calcium overload and coagulation alterations, and inducing myocardial infarction. The results showed that pretreatment with tetrandrine protects against the myocardial injuries caused by isoproterenol. It counteracted the appearance of myocardial necrotic lesions and ischemic electrocardiographic modifications, such as ST segment alterations, prevented the appearance of the plasma cardiac necrosis markers c-troponin I and myoglobin, lowered malondialdehyde levels, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time. The protective effects of tetrandrine can be attributed to its antioxidant action in lowering peroxide levels and its ability to counteract coagulating activity. Tetrandrine seems to offer full protection against myocardial infarction experimentally induced by the non-invasive treatment of rabbits with isoprotenerol.
This report includes 31 patients who developed a perimembranous glomerulonephritis generally 7 months after the onset of the treatment of various illnesses with D-Penicillamine. In all cases the patients had a proteinuria, associated with a hematuria in 12 cases. After the treatment was stopped 8 patients rapidly developed a nephrotic syndrome, while its onset was more gradual in 12 other patients. 5 patients initially with a nephrotic syndrome had no proteinuria at the time of a second biopsy made up to 12 months later. In these 5 cases the typical changes of perimembranous glomerulonephritis observed on electron microscopy were much reduced in the second biopsy.
Although several abnormalities in gap junction (GJ) structure and/or function have been described in neoplasms, the molecular mechanisms responsible for many of the alterations remain unknown. The identification of a family of GJ proteins, termed connexins, prompted this study of connexin32 (Cx32), connexin26 (Cx26) and connexin43 (Cx43) expression during rat hepatocarcinogenesis. Using antibody, cDNA and cRNA probes, we investigated connexin mRNA and protein expression in preneoplastic and neoplastic rat livers. In normal liver, Cx32 is expressed in hepatocytes throughout the hepatic acinus, Cx26 is restricted to periportal hepatocytes, and Cx43 is expressed by mesothelial cells forming Glisson's capsule. Most preneoplastic altered hepatic foci generated by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) initiation and either phenobarbital (PB) or 2,3,7,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) promotion exhibited decreased Cx32 or increased Cx26 staining. Foci from either protocol failed to display Cx43 immunoreactivity. In the majority of PB-promoted foci, Cx32 immunoreactivity decreased independently of changes in mRNA abundance. Continuous thymidine labeling, following cessation of PB promotion, showed that downregulation of Cx32 staining is reversible in foci that are promoter-dependent for growth, but irreversible in lesions that are promoter-independent for growth. Hepatic neoplasms from rats initiated with DEN and promoted with PB or TCDD also displayed modified connexin expression. While all 24 neoplasms studied were deficient in normal punctate Cx32 and Cx26 staining, altered cellular localization of these proteins was apparent in some tumors. Immunoblotting of crude tissue extracts revealed that neoplasms with disordered Cx32 staining showed immunoreactive bands with altered electrophoretic mobility. These observations show that hepatomas may downregulate Cx32 expression through changes in the primary structure of Cx32 or by post-translational modifications. Northern blotting of total tumor mRNAs failed to demonstrate consistent changes in the abundance of Cx32, Cx26 or Cx43 transcripts. Some tumors expressed steady-state transcripts without observable immunoreactivity, indicating that some hepatomas downregulate connexin immunoreactivity independently of mRNA abundance. Increased levels of Cx43 mRNA and protein were found in several neoplasms, but immunostaining was always localized to nonparenchymal cells. Areas of bile duct proliferation and cholangiomas displayed Cx43 staining, whereas, cholangiocarcinomas were deficient in immunoreactivity. These findings show that alterations in the expression of connexins, by either downregulation or differential induction, represent common modifications during hepatocarcinogenesis. Although our results imply that connexins represent useful markers for the boundary between tumor promotion and progression, preneoplastic and neoplastic rat hepatocytes fail to use a common mechanism to modify connexin expression.
A search for mutations in the gene for type II procollagen (COL2A1) was carried out in affected members of a family with early-onset cataracts, lattice degeneration of the retina, and retinal detachment. They had no symptoms suggestive of involvement of nonocular tissues, as is typically found in the Stickler syndrome. The COL2A1 gene was amplified with PCR, and the products were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The results suggested a mutation in one allele for exon 10. Sequencing of the fragment demonstrated a single-base mutation that converted the codon for glycine at position alpha 1-67 to aspartate. The mutation was found in three affected members of the family available for study but not in unaffected members or 100 unrelated individuals. Comparison with previously reported mutations suggested that mutations introducing premature termination codons in the COL2A1 gene are a frequent cause of the Stickler syndrome, but mutations in the COL2A1 gene that replace glycine codons with codons for bulkier amino acid can produce a broad spectrum of disorders that range from lethal chondrodysplasias to a syndrome involving only ocular tissues, similar to the syndrome in the family originally described by Wagner in 1938.
1. The ability of atipamezole, a specific and selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, to reverse the pharmacological effects induced by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine was studied in six healthy male volunteers. Each volunteer received in four sessions in a randomized and single-blind manner three different doses (6.7 micrograms kg-1, 27 micrograms kg-1 and 67 micrograms kg-1) of atipamezole or saline placebo as 5 min i.v. infusions preceded by a fixed i.v. dose of dexmedetomidine (0.67 micrograms kg-1). 2. Dexmedetomidine caused profound sedation, with the subjects actually falling asleep. This was effectively reversed by the two highest doses of antipamezole. 3. Dexmedetomidine reduced salivary flow on average by 70%. A rapid and full reversal of this effect was seen after the highest dose of antipamezole. 4. Hypotension induced by dexmedetomidine was also effectively antagonized by atipamezole. Bradycardia was very modest after dexmedetomidine in this study, and thus no reversal of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist-induced bradycardia could be demonstrated. 5. Plasma noradrenaline concentrations were reduced by 80% by dexmedetomidine. This was effectively antagonized by atipamezole, and the highest dose caused a 50% overshoot in plasma noradrenaline concentrations over the basal levels. 6. It is concluded that the effects of dexmedetomidine are effectively reversible by atipamezole. A dose ratio of 10:1 for atipamezole:dexmedetomidine was clearly insufficient for this purpose, but ratios in the range of 40:1 to 100:1 were found to be effective in the current experimental situation.
In order to maintain normal functioning of the brain, glutamate homeostasis and extracellular levels of excitotoxic amino acids (EAA) must be tightly controlled. This is accomplished, in large measure, by the astroglial high-affinity Na+-dependent EAA transporters glutamate/ aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1). Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxicant. Astrocytes are known targets for MeHg toxicity, representing a site for mercury localization. MeHg is known to cause astrocytic swelling, EAA release, and uptake inhibition in astrocytes, leading to increased extracellular glutamate levels and ensuing neuronal excitotoxicity and degeneration. However, the mechanisms and contribution of specific glutamate transporters to MeHg-induced glutamate dyshomeostasis remain unknown. Accordingly, the present study was carried out to investigate the effects of MeHg on the transport of [d-2, 3-3H]-d-aspartate, a nonmetabolizable glutamate analog in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) transfected with the glutamate transporter subtypes GLAST or GLT-1. Additional studies examined the effects of MeHg on mRNA and protein levels of these transporters. Our results indicate the following (1) MeHg selectively affects glutamate transporter mRNA expression. MeHg treatment (6 h) led to no discernible changes in GLAST mRNA expression; however, GLT-1 mRNA expression significantly (p < 0.001) increased following treatments with 5 or 10 microM MeHg. (2) Selective changes in the expression of glutamate transporter protein levels were also noted. GLAST transporter protein levels significantly (p < 0.001, both at 5 and 10 microM MeHg) increased and GLT-1 transporter protein levels significantly (p < 0.001) decreased following MeHg exposure (5 microM). (3) MeHg exposure led to significant inhibition (p < 0.05) of glutamate uptake by GLAST (both 5 and 10 microM MeHg), whereas GLT-1 transporter activity was significantly (p < 0.01) increased following exposure to 5 and 10 microM MeHg. These studies suggest that MeHg contributes to the dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis and that its effects are distinct for GLAST and GLT-1.
Two patients with a hypersensitivity vasculitis in association with propylthiouracil (PTU) administration are described. Although both patients presented with a cutaneous eruption, our first patient suffered severe systemic manifestations and the second patient's involvement was primarily limited to the skin. Patients with a vascular hypersensitivity reaction to PTU typically present with constitutional symptoms, acral purpuric skin lesions, and variable involvement of multiple organ systems. The reaction is treated by urgent withdrawal of PTU and implementation of supportive measures and immunosuppressive agents, as necessary. Prompt recognition of this condition and initiation of appropriate therapy lead to complete recovery in most cases.
A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department with confusion, agitation, diaphoresis, and muscle rigidity after beginning treatment with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. He had discontinued treatment with tranylcypromine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, 2 weeks earlier. The constellation of findings was diagnostic of the serotonin syndrome.
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3, arsenite) efficiently kills cells from various hematologic malignancies and has successfully been employed especially for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. There and in lymphoid cells, we demonstrated that As2O3 induces cell death in a caspase-2- and -9-independent fashion. Here, we address a potential role of death receptor signaling through the FADD/caspase-8 death-inducing signaling complex in As2O3-induced cell death. In detail, we demonstrate that As2O3 induces cell death independently of caspase-8 or FADD and cannot be blocked by disruption of CD95/Fas receptor ligand interaction. Unlike in death receptor ligation-induced apoptosis, As2O3-induced cell death was not blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk or the caspase-8-specific inhibitor z-IETD-fmk. Nevertheless, As2O3-induced cell death occurred in a regulated manner and was abrogated upon Bcl-2 overexpression. In contrast, As2O3-induced cell demise was neither blocked by the caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk nor substantially inhibited through the expression of a dominant negative caspase-9 mutant. Altogether our data demonstrate that As2O3-induced cell death occurs independently of the extrinsic death receptor pathway of apoptosis. Cell death proceeds entirely via an intrinsic, Bcl-2-controlled mitochondrial pathway that does, however, not rely on caspase-9.
A 53-year-old man with a known history of alcohol abuse was admitted to hospital after a minor collapse. He had a laceration to the forehead and three rib fractures. Laboratory blood-analysis showed raised non-cholestatic liver-enzyme levels suggesting alcohol-abuse. On history taking the patient was shown to have been suffering from personality changes and multiple hallucinogenic episodes for the previous two years. He had been seen and evaluated by a neurologist to that effect. The patient's family had accepted the situation and thought of it as dementia, probably caused by alcohol abuse. He had been treated for atrial flutter and was taking acenocoumerol, atorvastatin, quinapril and metoprolol 50 mg twice daily as medication. During admission the patient appeared to be suffering from a delirium with complex visual and auditory hallucinations, for which he was given haloperidol. Revision of medication use led to the stopping of metoprolol, which had been started two years earlier. Within 24 hours the delirium had disappeared completely. There was spontaneous fall in the liver enzymes. At his last follow-up, the patient had had no psychiatric symptoms for 6 months. The relationship between stopping metoprolol and the disappearance of the psychosis appeared to be a causal one and this is supported by the limited literature available on this subject.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, New Jersey) is an antimalarial agent, which is sometimes used for the treatment of certain autoimmune disorders. Its use has been associated with ocular side effects; the most concerning is toxic maculopathy.
A 71-year-old arthritic white woman requested a second opinion regarding retinal Plaquenil toxicity. The patients history was significant for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed 6 years prior. She had taken Plaquenil 400 mg a day for about 5 years but had discontinued the drug 6 months before when bilateral central scotomas were first noted. At the consultation visit, her visual acuities were 20/20 in both eyes. SITA-Standard 10-2 disclosed a dense scotoma with 4 degrees of central sparing in each eye. Fundus examination found retinal pigment epithelium changes bilaterally; no "bulls eye" retinopathy was observed.
Withdrawal of the medication is the only effective treatment for Plaquenil toxicity and, even then, the toxic effects may progress because of the slow clearance of the drug. Though controversy exists regarding screening recommendations, a baseline ophthalmic examination should be performed on all patients before initiating Plaquenil. If a patient is considered low risk, examinations can be scheduled annually. For high-risk patients, 6-month progress visits are strongly recommended.
Rats, fixed with chronically indwelling electrodes for electrical intracranial stimulation (ICS) of the lateral hypothalamus, were taught to press a bar for ICS. Once pressing rates became stable, during daily 20-min sessions, rats were given cocaine (5 or 20 mg/kg) before the sessions. When given daily, cocaine consistently enhanced rates of pressing. When a combination of small doses of isradipine (e.g., 1 mg/kg) and naltrexone (3 mg/kg) were given before cocaine administration. the combination blocked cocaine's enhancement of pressing for ICS. The combination, however, neither reduced rates of pressing below those observed under placebos (i.e., baseline conditions) nor reduced rates when no cocaine was given. Naltrexone and isradipine (in the dose used in the combination) by themselves did not block cocaine's effects. This profile of effects indicates that a combination of isradipine and naltrexone is apt to be useful in treating cocaine use disorders.
Inherited peripheral neuropathies are frequent neuromuscular disorders known for their clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In 33 families, we identified 8 mutations in HINT1 (encoding histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1) by combining linkage analyses with next-generation sequencing and subsequent cohort screening of affected individuals. Our study provides evidence that loss of functional HINT1 protein results in a distinct phenotype of autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia.
Respiratory and cardiovascular effects of midaglizole (DG-5128, CAS 66529-17-7) were investigated in comparison with yohimbine, idazoxan and tolbutamide. 1. Respiration: Midaglizole had little or no effect on respiration of anesthetized dogs. Yohimbine and idazoxan augmented respiration at low dose. Tolbutamide depressed respiratory rate and depth at high dose. 2. Blood pressure and heart rate: Midaglizole produced dose-related hypotension and bradycardia in anesthetized dogs which had laparotomy, whereas it had little or no effect on blood pressure and heart rate of dogs which had no laparotomy (unlaparotomized dogs). Tendency of slight hypertension was observed after high dose of tolbutamide in laparotomized dogs, and transient hypotension was induced in unlaparotomized dogs. Yohimbine and idazoxan increased blood pressure at low dose in unlaparotomized dogs. In laparotomized dogs, yohimbine produced hypertension and hypotension at low and high doses, respectively. In isolated guinea pig atria, midaglizole produced bradycardia which was not observed after yohimbine. Tolbutamide decreased the pulse rate at high concentration. 3. Cardiac contractility: Midaglizole produced increase in cardiac contractility of anesthetized dogs. Yohimbine and idazoxan, at low dose, showed similar inotropic activity. Prazosin also produced a positive inotropic effect, whereas tolbutamide lacked the activity. The inotropic effects of midaglizole and yohimbine were antagonized by pretreatment with propranolol or hexamethonium, whereas a similar effect of prazosin was not influenced by both blockers. In isolated guinea pig atria, midaglizole showed slight inotropic activity. Yohimbine was without any effect, whereas tolbutamide reduced the contractile force. 4. Femoral blood flow: Midaglizole produced a transient increase in femoral blood flow and a decrease in femoral arterial resistance of anesthetized dogs. Yohimbine and idazoxan, at low dose, showed similar vasodilator activity. Prazosin also produced a vasodilator effect, whereas tolbutamide lacked the activity. The vasodilator effects of midaglizole and yohimbine were not affected with propranolol, but inhibited after hexamethonium. 5. Mesenteric blood flow: Midaglizole significantly decreased mesenteric blood flow and increased the arterial resistance of anesthetized dogs in a dose dependent manner. Tolbutamide induced a decrease in blood flow and an increase in arterial resistance only at the highest dose used. Yohimbine increased mesenteric blood flow at low dose and decreased it at high dose. 6. Renal blood flow: Midaglizole dose-relatedly decreased renal blood flow of anesthetized dogs. Tolbutamide and yohimbine at high dose produced a long-lasting decrease of the blood flow. Midaglizole produced a slight transient reduction of renal arterial resistance which was followed by a slight increase. Tolbutamide increased the arterial resistance at high dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
(Glyco)sphingolipids (GSL) are believed to protect the cell against harmful environmental factors by increasing the rigidity of plasma membrane. Marked decrease of membrane fluidity in cholestatic hepatocytes was described but the role of GSL therein has not been investigated so far. In this study, localization in hepatocytes of a representative of GSL, the GM1 ganglioside, was compared between of rats with cholestasis induced by 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE) and vehicle propanediol treated or untreated animals. GM1 was monitored by histochemical reaction employing cholera toxin B-subunit. Our findings in normal rat liver tissue showed that GM1 was localized in sinusoidal and canalicular hepatocyte membranes in both peripheral and intermediate zones of the hepatic lobules, and was nearly absent in central zones. On the contrary, in EE-treated animals GM1 was also expressed in central lobular zones. Moreover, detailed densitometry analysis at high magnification showed greater difference of GM1 expression between sinusoidal surface areas and areas of adjacent cytoplasm, caused as well by increased sinusoidal staining in central lobular zone as by decreased staining in cytoplasm in peripheral zone. These differences correlated with serum bile acids as documented by linear regression analyses. Both GM1 content and mRNA corresponding to GM1-synthase remained unchanged in livers; the enhanced expression of GM1 at sinusoidal membrane thus seems to be due to re-distribution of cellular GM1 at limited biosynthesis and could be responsible for protection of hepatocytes against harmful effects of bile acids accumulated during cholestasis.
Progressive renal interstitial fibrosis is characterized by up-regulated expression of the gene that encodes the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), a regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling, suggesting that impaired matrix turnover contributes to the fibrogenic process. The present study was designed to develop a murine model of renal interstitial fibrosis, and to determine the functional significance of up-regulated Timp-1 expression by comparing the severity of this renal disease in wild-type mice and mice genetically deficient in Timp-1.
Initial pilot studies developed and characterized a murine model of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-induced protein-overload proteinuria with respect to the degree of proteinuria, severity of interstitial fibrosis, and renal mRNA levels for genes encoding matrix proteins, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4. In the final study, the severity of interstitial fibrosis was compared in wild-type and Timp-1-deficient mice after six weeks of proteinuria.
Mice injected with large daily intraperitoneal doses of BSA developed proteinuria, interstitial inflammation, and progressive interstitial fibrosis. A time course study based on measurements after one, two, and six weeks of BSA injections showed increased renal mRNA levels for the matrix genes procollagens alpha1(I), alpha1(III), and alpha2(IV) and TGF-beta1 and Timp-1. Timp-2 and Timp-3 genes were constitutively expressed at high levels in the normal kidneys and showed little change in the proteinuric kidneys. Timp-4 transcripts were not detected in any of the kidneys. After six weeks of BSA overload-proteinuria, the groups (N = 8 per group) of wild-type and Timp-1-deficient mice developed significant interstitial fibrosis compared with the control saline-injected groups. The severity of the interstitial fibrosis was similar in both proteinuric groups based on an assessment of the final kidney weight, total kidney collagen content, and the number of interstitial fields with increased fibronectin staining.
Results of the present study indicate that TIMP-1 deficiency does not alter the degree of interstitial fibrosis in the murine overload proteinuria model. Potential explanations include Timp-1 genetic redundancy, as suggested by the observation that, despite significant intrarenal induction of the Timp-1 gene expression, net renal metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity was not significantly altered. TIMP-1 is a multifunctional protein that may play a metalloproteinase-independent role in response to renal injury.
We genotyped 2,861 cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) from the UK PBC Consortium and 8,514 UK population controls across 196,524 variants within 186 known autoimmune risk loci. We identified 3 loci newly associated with PBC (at P<5×10(-8)), increasing the number of known susceptibility loci to 25. The most associated variant at 19p12 is a low-frequency nonsynonymous SNP in TYK2, further implicating JAK-STAT and cytokine signaling in disease pathogenesis. An additional five loci contained nonsynonymous variants in high linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2>0.8) with the most associated variant at the locus. We found multiple independent common, low-frequency and rare variant association signals at five loci. Of the 26 independent non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) signals tagged on the Immunochip, 15 have SNPs in B-lymphoblastoid open chromatin regions in high LD (r2>0.8) with the most associated variant. This study shows how data from dense fine-mapping arrays coupled with functional genomic data can be used to identify candidate causal variants for functional follow-up.
Fulminant hepatic failure is an uncommon adverse effect of valproate treatment. Despite an increased use of valproate, since the drug was introduced in 1978, a decline in the number of reported cases has been observed. Here a case of hemorrhagic shock and fulminant hepatic failure in a patient treated with valproate is presented. We emphasize the diagnostic difficulties from the point of view of recognition of the clinical manifestations as well as the biochemical monitoring.
Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin is the current standard of care. Undetectable HCV-RNA in serum by a sensitive molecular test six months after the end of treatment is the primary aim of antiviral therapy in patients with hepatitis C. The group of "difficult-to-treat" patients is heterogeneous and comprises patients with a difficult indication for antiviral therapy (asymptomatic, minimal histological activity, persistently normal aminotransferase levels, etc.), patients with low chances for achieving a sustained virologic response (HCV genotype 1 infection, high baseline viral load, liver cirrhosis, immunosuppression, HIV coinfection, etc.), patients without sustained virologic response in a previous treatment course (nonresponder, relapser), patients who cannot tolerate interferon-alpha and/or ribavirin, and patients with poor compliance. Councelling in an experienced center is advised in the case of a difficult decision whether to treat or not. Options in patients with low chances for a sustained virologic response and in nonresponders are retreatment with a pegylated interferon and ribavirin at a higher dose and/or a longer treatment duration. Clinical trials with new antiviral agents are highly relevant for this patient population as for those patients who cannot tolerate (peg)interferon-alpha and/or ribavirin. Side effects in patients receiving pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin should be actively treated (e.g. serotonine re-uptake inhibitors for depression, erythropoetin for ribavirin-associated anemia, etc.). In addition, optimisation of adherence and compliance is always mandatory.
