The ability of a pretreatment with the cholecystokininB-receptor (CCK[B]) antagonist L-365,260 to prevent the development of morphine dependence was studied in normal and neuropathic (unilateral peripheral neuropathy) rats. A 4-day pretreatment regimen with two daily s.c. injections of either saline+saline, saline+morphine (3.0 mg/kg) or L-365,260 (0.2 mg/kg)+morphine was used, and withdrawal was precipitated by an injection of naloxone (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg i.v.) at 24 h after the last pretreatment injection. After pretreatment with morphine alone, physical dependence developed in both normal and neuropathic rats. However, the incidence of teeth chattering and ptosis was higher in neuropathic rats. Pretreatment with the combination of L-365,260 and morphine prevented the expression of teeth chattering, ptosis, diarrhea, writhing and piloerection, but was devoid of effects on the exploratory activity among both groups of rats. These results suggest that endogenous CCK acting on CCK(B)-receptors may be involved in the development of morphine dependence both in normal and neuropathic rats.
The natural phytoestrogen resveratrol (RSV) may have therapeutic potential for arthritic conditions. RSV is chondroprotective for articular cartilage in rabbit models for arthritis, but its biological effects on human articular cartilage and chondrosarcoma cells are unknown. Effects of RSV on human articular cartilage homeostasis were studied by assessing production of matrix-degrading enzymes (MMP-13, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS5), as well as proteoglycan production and synthesis. The counteractions of RSV against catabolic factors (e.g., FGF-2 or IL-1β) were examined by in vitro and ex vivo using monolayer, three-dimensional alginate beads and cartilage explants cultures, respectively. RSV improves cell viability of articular chondrocytes and effectively antagonizes cartilage-degrading protease production that was initiated by catabolic and/or anti-anabolic cytokines in human articular chondrocytes. RSV significantly also enhances BMP7-promoted proteoglycan synthesis as assessed by (35) S-sulfate incorporation. Protein-DNA interaction arrays suggest that RSV inhibits the activation of transcription factors involved in inflammation and cartilage catabolic signaling pathways, including direct downstream regulators of MAPK (e.g., AP-1, PEA3) and NFκB. RSV selectively compromises survival of human chondrosarcoma cells, but not primary articular chondrocytes, revealing cell-specific activity of RSV on non-tumorigenic versus tumor-derived cells. We propose that RSV exerts its chondroprotective functions, in part, by deactivating p53-induced apoptosis in human primary chondrocytes, but not human chondrosarcoma. Our findings suggest that RSV has potential as a unique biologic treatment for both prevention and treatment of cartilage degenerative diseases.
The effects of the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, clonidine, on the "quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome" (QMWS) were examined in drug naive rats. The QMWS was induced by combined systemic administration of iso-butyl-methylxanthine (IBMX: 15 mg/kg, IP) and naloxone (1 mg/kg, IP). Pretreatment with clonidine (50 micrograms/kg, IP) significantly decreased the incidence of 11 out of 16 withdrawal signs. Since clonidine suppresses signs and symptoms of true morphine withdrawal, the suppression of methylxanthine effects demonstrates an additional similarity of the QMWS to true morphine withdrawal. These results suggest that a significant common neural mechanism of both the QMWS and true morphine withdrawal is affected by clonidine.
Full remission of more than five years was observed in nine of 24 children with acute lymphatic leukaemia. They had been treated by a scheme similar to the Pinkel VII one, and all had been discharged from treatment. The immune status, bone marrow, radiological, neurological and psychosomatic studies, as well as various laboratory tests indicated that in seven of the children the findings, are essentially normal. But two children have lasting severe organ damage, portal fibrosis in one and bilateral intracerebral calcification in the other, both presumably due to the methotrexate treatment.
Many donor organs come from youths involved in alcohol-related accidental death. The use of cardiac allografts for transplantation from donors after acute poisoning is still under discussion while acute ethanol intoxication is associated with myocardial functional and morphological changes. The aims of this work were 1) to evaluate in rats the time-course cardiac effects of acute ethanol-exposure and 2) to explore how its abuse by donors might affect recipients in cardiac pump function after transplantation.
Rats received saline or ethanol (3.45 g/kg, ip). We evaluated both the mechanical and electrical aspects of cardiac function 1 h, 6 h or 24 h after injection. Plasma cardiac troponin-T and glucose-levels were measured and histological examination of the myocardium was performed. In addition, heart transplantation was performed, in which donors received ethanol 6 h or 24 h prior to explantation. Graft function was measured 1 h or 24 h after transplantation. Myocardial TBARS-concentration was measured; mRNA and protein expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.
Ethanol administration resulted in decreased load-dependent (-34 ± 9%) and load-independent (-33 ± 12%) contractility parameters, LV end-diastolic pressure and elevated blood glucose levels at 1 h, which were reversed to the level of controls after 6 h and 24 h. In contrast to systolic dysfunction, active relaxation and passive stiffness are slowly recovered or sustained during 24 h. Moreover, troponin-T-levels were increased at 1 h, 6 h and 24 h after ethanol injection. ST-segment elevation (+47 ± 10%), elongated QT-interval (+38 ± 4%), enlarged cardiomyocyte, DNA-strand breaks, increased both mRNA and protein levels of superoxide dismutase-1, glutathione peroxydase-4, cytochrome-c-oxidase and metalloproteinase-9 were observed 24 h following ethanol-exposure. After heart transplantation, decreased myocardial contractility and relaxation, oxidative stress and altered protein expression were observed.
These results demonstrate acute alcohol abuse increases the susceptibility of donor hearts to ischemia/reperfusion in a rat heart transplant model even though the global contractile function recovers 6 h after ethanol-administration.
Microdeletions of 22q11.2 represent one of the highest known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. It is likely that more than one gene contributes to the marked risk associated with this locus. Two of the candidate risk genes encode the enzymes proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which modulate the levels of a putative neuromodulator (L-proline) and the neurotransmitter dopamine, respectively. Mice that model the state of PRODH deficiency observed in humans with schizophrenia show increased neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses as well as deficits in associative learning and response to psychomimetic drugs. Transcriptional profiling and pharmacological manipulations identified a transcriptional and behavioral interaction between the Prodh and Comt genes that is likely to represent a homeostatic response to enhanced dopaminergic signaling in the frontal cortex. This interaction modulates a number of schizophrenia-related phenotypes, providing a framework for understanding the high disease risk associated with this locus, the expression of the phenotype, or both.
Renal glomeruli isolated from normal rats and from rats with gentamicin-induced renal failure were incubated with substances that modify nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and the resulting changes in glomerular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Glomeruli from normal and gentamicin-treated rats contained 0.17 +/- 0.04 and 2.02 +/- 0.63 pmol cGMP/mg protein respectively. In normal glomeruli, acetylcholine and bradykinin significantly increased cGMP levels whereas NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester, an inhibitor of NO synthesis, completely blocked this increase. In glomeruli from gentamicin-treated animals, acetylcholine and bradykinin also stimulated cGMP accumulation, while NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester decreased the cGMP content to levels significantly below the basal concentrations. These data suggest an increased glomerular production of NO in rats with gentamicin-induced renal failure.
Oral administration of the insecticide endosulfan (2 mg/kg per day) for 90 days in immature male rats resulted in an inhibition of pole-climbing escape response to electric shock (unconditioned) and avoidance response to buzzer (conditioned). These responses reflect respectively their learning and memory processes. The escape response but not the avoidance response was reinstated significantly by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) depletor, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 100 mg/kg per day for 3 days). Endosulfan increased 5-HT concentrations in the cerebrum and midbrain regions. Protein content and acetylcholinesterase activity were unaltered in the brain. The spontaneous motor activity of these animals was stimulated. Their muscle coordination on rota-rod apparatus was unaffected. These findings were interpreted as an indication that a motivation deficit and not motor impairment was responsible for the inhibitory action of endosulfan on pole-climbing escape and avoidance responses. Thus, endosulfan was suggested to produce learning and memory deficit. A serotonergic involvement was significant in endosulfan-induced learning impairment and it appeared to be negligible in its memory disrupting action.
Ciprofloxacin, a commonly prescribed fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has generally been well-tolerated; however, there are rare reports of associated hepatic failure or renal failure. We describe a case of a 65 year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who was treated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for cellulitis. Six days into his treatment course, he developed acute cholestatic jaundice and acute anuric renal failure. Clinical, laboratory, and pathologic data suggest that the patient had developed reversible, severe ciprofloxacin-induced cholestatic liver injury and acute tubular necrosis requiring hemodialysis. Within two months of stopping the ciprofloxacin, the patient was off dialysis and back to his baseline creatinine in three months. Liver tests normalized by five months. This report illustrates a case of cholestatic liver injury and renal failure involving ciprofloxacin use. We review the literature regarding hepatic and renal injury as it relates to ciprofloxacin. To our knowledge, this represents the first case report of simultaneous acute cholestatic liver injury and renal failure secondary to ciprofloxacin.
Local pain at the site of an i.v. injection of propofol is a well-known problem, particularly in infants. This randomised investigator-blinded crossover study was designed to assess the effect of the i.v. bolus infusion rate on propofol-induced pain at the site of injection.
Thirty unpremedicated patients scheduled for ear-nose-throat or plastic surgery at Malmö University Hospital, Sweden, were given two consecutive 2.0 ml injections of propofol 10 mg/ml (Diprivan, AstraZeneca, Sweden/UK), at different infusion rates (0.2 or 1.0 ml/s), immediately before induction of general anesthesia. Half of the patients (n=15) received the first bolus of propofol over 2 s and the second bolus over 10 s, and the other half (n=15) had their injections in reversed order. After each injection, the patient was asked by an investigator to indicate pain intensity on a visual analog scale (VAS) and to report the times of the appearance, maximum point and disappearance of pain. The injections were given approximately 2 min apart. The investigators scoring pain intensity, as indicated by the patients on a 10-point numerical rate scale, were blinded to the order in which the injections were given, as were the patients themselves.
There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence (both 86%) of intensity (median; 25th; 75th percentiles, in VAS units: 3.1; 1.0; 5.3 and 3.3; 1.4; 5.0, respectively) or duration (66+/-31 and 73+/-26 s, respectively) of pain between the faster (1.0 ml/s) and slower (0.2 ml/s) bolus infusion rates of propofol studied.
We conclude that the i.v. bolus infusion rate of propofol does not influence drug-induced local pain on injection, at least not within the infusion rate interval studied. Therefore, adjusting i.v. injection speed does not seem to be a clinically useful tool for reducing the intensity or duration of propofol-induced pain at the site of administration.
The prognosis for cholangiocarcinoma remains dismal due to a low resection rate and early recurrence. Cancer cachexia is associated with decreased survival and poor quality of life. Herein, we present a rat model of cholangiocarcinoma and demonstrate that thalidomide attenuates tumor growth and improves cachexia.
A cholangiocarcinoma model was established using Sprague-Dawley rats that were fed thioacetamide for 40 weeks. Cholangiocarcinoma rats were treated using either thalidomide or saline for 8 weeks. Tumor growth and body weight were recorded for all animals. The expression of CD31, VEGF, and eIF4E of cholangiocarcinoma were determined using immunohistochemistry. Level of apoptosis and Fas-mediated apoptosis genes of cholangiocarcinoma were determined using TUNEL assay and ribonuclease protection assay, respectively. The distribution of fast-twitch soleus skeletal muscle fibers was determined as was the expression of TNFalpha and TGFbeta1 within soleus muscle.
After an 8-week treatment, the mean weight of saline- and thalidomide-treated rats was 24% and 19%, respectively, less than that of control (ANOVA, P < .05). The tumor volume (x +/-SD) of thalidomide-treated rats was less than saline-treated rats (1.9 +/- 0.4 vs 4.6 +/- 1.3 cm3, P < .01). The expression of CD31, eIF4E, and VEGF of cholangiocarcinoma was less than thalidomide-treated rats than for saline-treated rats, while the level of apoptosis of tumor cells was greater for thalidomide- treated rats than for saline-treated rats. The expression of mRNA for Fas, caspase-3, and Bax of cholangiocarcinoma in the thalidomide-treated rats was greater than for saline-treated rats. The number of fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers per 500 mm2 of control, saline-, and thalidomide-treated rats was 43 +/- 6, 14 +/- 3, and 41 +/- 8 (ANOVA, P < .001). The expression of TNFalpha and TGFbeta1 of soleus muscles for thalidomide-treated rats was less than for saline-treated rats.
Using our rat cholangiocarcinoma model, we demonstrated that thalidomide inhibited tumor growth and was associated with a decrease in expression of reduced eIF4E and VEGF expression; in addition, thalidomide preserved fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers and was associated with decreased expression of TNFalpha and TGFbeta1.
Genes mutated in congenital malformation syndromes are frequently implicated in oncogenesis, but the causative germline and somatic mutations occur in separate cells at different times of an organism's life. Here we unify these processes to a single cellular event for mutations arising in male germ cells that show a paternal age effect. Screening of 30 spermatocytic seminomas for oncogenic mutations in 17 genes identified 2 mutations in FGFR3 (both 1948A>G, encoding K650E, which causes thanatophoric dysplasia in the germline) and 5 mutations in HRAS. Massively parallel sequencing of sperm DNA showed that levels of the FGFR3 mutation increase with paternal age and that the mutation spectrum at the Lys650 codon is similar to that observed in bladder cancer. Most spermatocytic seminomas show increased immunoreactivity for FGFR3 and/or HRAS. We propose that paternal age-effect mutations activate a common 'selfish' pathway supporting proliferation in the testis, leading to diverse phenotypes in the next generation including fetal lethality, congenital syndromes and cancer predisposition.
Potassium deprivation has recently been reported to potentiate the degree of functional impairment in a gentamicin-induced model of acute renal failure. The present study investigated the effects of two different states of potassium homeostasis on the development of cellular injury in the early stage of gentamicin nephrotoxicity in dogs. Gentamicin (15 mg. per kg. intramuscularly twice daily) was administered for 4 and 7 days to potassium-depleted or potassium-supplemented animals. The results show that potassium supplementation markedly lessens the severity of pathologic alterations induced by gentamicin. In both groups of animals, the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule were the most consistently damaged regions of of the nephron. Potassium-supplemented dogs had a significantly higher number of normal proximal tubule cells than did the animals deprived of potassium and viewed 7 days after gentamicin treatment (77.3 versus 36.9 per cent; p less than 0.025). The degree of total injury to the proximal tubule was significantly higher in potassium-depleted animals than in those supplemented with potassium (59.9 versus 21.9 per cent; p less than 0.05). Only those dogs depleted of potassium prior to the administration of gentamicin had a markedly elevated plasma creatinine level of proximal tubular injury and functional impairment (r = 0.81; p less than 0.005). Potassium supplementation appears to lessen the extent of structural alterations seen in this model of gentamicin-induced acute renal failure in dogs.
Early cocaine exposure is associated with a wide variety of neurobehavioral and teratogenic effects. The current study was conducted to determine the long-term effects of such exposure on the hamster circadian timing system. The circadian system drives rhythms in a tremendous diversity of physiological, behavioral, and endocrine functions. The fetal circadian pacemaker has recently been shown to express a functional D1 dopamine system that is involved in maternal-fetal entrainment. Maternally administered cocaine, acting on the fetal clock, could therefore potentially have long-lasting effects on exposed offspring. Pregnant SCN-lesioned hamsters or their pups, maintained in constant dim illumination (DD), were administered cocaine (30 mg/kg, SC, N = 10 litters) or saline vehicle (N = 5 litters) from embryonic (E) day 15 [day of mating = E0] through postnatal (P) day 5. Upon weaning (P21), cocaine- and saline-treated offspring were placed in individual running wheels for a period of 5-6 weeks. Individuals were then challenged with 1-h light pulses at three circadian times (CT7, CT14, CT18). Cocaine-treated litters had a statistically significant mean phase advance of +0.32 h at CT14 compared with the mean phase delay of 2.13 h of the saline-treated litters. No significant differences were seen at the other two circadian times, although there was heterogeneity in the responses among cocaine-treated animals. This represents the first demonstration of an effect of perinatal cocaine on the circadian timing system. Together with the recent demonstration of D1 receptors in the human SCN, these findings raise the possibility that gestational cocaine abuse by humans may also lead to later disturbances in the circadian timing system.
Vinyl chloride (VC) is a know animal and human carcinogen associated with liver angiosarcomas (LAS) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In VC-associated LAS mutations of the K- ras -2 gene have been reported; however, no data about the prevalence of such mutations in VC associated HCCs are available. Recent data indicate K- ras -2 mutations induce P16 methylation accompanied by inactivation of the p16 gene. The presence of K- ras -2 mutations was analysed in tissue from 18 patients with VC associated HCCs. As a control group, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma due to hepatitis B (n = 7), hepatitis C (n = 5) and alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n = 8) was used. The specific mutations were determined by direct sequencing of codon 12 and 13 of the K- ras -2 gene in carcinomatous and adjacent non-neoplastic liver tissue after microdissection. The status of p16 was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), microsatellite analysis, DNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining. All patients had a documented chronic quantitated exposure to VC (average 8883 ppmy, average duration: 245 months). K- ras -2 mutations were found in 6 of 18 (33%) examined VC-associated HCCs and in 3 cases of adjacent non-neoplastic liver tissue. There were 3 G --> A point mutations in the tumour tissue. All 3 mutations found in non-neoplastic liver from VC-exposed patients were also G --> A point mutations (codon 12- and codon 13-aspartate mutations). Hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island of the p16 gene was found in 13 of 18 examined carcinomas (72%). Of 6 cancers with K- ras -2 mutations, 5 specimens also showed methylated p16. Within the control group, K- ras -2 mutation were found in 3 of 20 (15%) examined HCC. p16 methylation occurred in 11 out of 20 (55%) patients. K- ras -2 mutations and p16 methylation are frequent events in VC associated HCCs. We observed a K- ras -2 mutation pattern characteristic of chloroethylene oxide, a carcinogenic metabolite of VC. Our results strongly suggest that K- ras -2 mutations play an important role in the pathogenesis of VC-associated HCC.
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are members of a family of enzymes that utilize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) as substrate to form large ADP-ribose polymers (PAR) in the nucleus. PAR has a very short half-life due to its rapid degradation by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). PARP-1 mediates acute neuronal cell death induced by a variety of insults including cerebral ischemia, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Parkinsonism, and CNS trauma. While PARP-1 is localized to the nucleus, PARG resides in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Surprisingly, there appears to be only one gene encoding PARG activity, which has been characterized in vitro to generate different splice variants, in contrast to the growing family of PARPs. Little is known regarding the spatial and functional relationships of PARG and PARP-1. Here we evaluate PARG expression in the brain and its cellular and subcellular distribution in relation to PARP-1. Anti-PARG (alpha-PARG) antibodies raised in rabbits using a purified 30 kDa C-terminal fragment of murine PARG recognize a single band at 111 kDa in the brain. Western blot analysis also shows that PARG and PARP-1 are evenly distributed throughout the brain. Immunohistochemical studies using alpha-PARG antibodies reveal punctate cytosolic staining, whereas anti-PARP-1 (alpha-PARP-1) antibodies demonstrate nuclear staining. PARG is enriched in the mitochondrial fraction together with manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and cytochrome C (Cyt C) following whole brain subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis. Confocal microscopy confirms the co-localization of PARG and Cyt C. Finally, PARG translocation to the nucleus is triggered by NMDA-induced PARP-1 activation. Therefore, the subcellular segregation of PARG in the mitochondria and PARP-1 in the nucleus suggests that PARG translocation is necessary for their functional interaction. This translocation is PARP-1 dependent, further demonstrating a functional interaction of PARP-1 and PARG in the brain.
In an earlier report, we showed that a shorter CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor (AR) gene is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in China, the population with the lowest reported prostate cancer incidence in the world. Because AR coactivators enhance transactivation of AR, in this report we evaluated the relationship of a CAG/CAA repeat length polymorphism in the AIB1/SRC-3 gene (amplified in breast cancer gene 1, a steroid receptor coactivator and an AR coactivator) with prostate cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in China. Genomic DNA from 189 prostate cancer patients and 301 healthy controls was used for the PCR-based assay. The AIB1/SRC-3 CAG/CAA repeat length ranged from 24 to 32, with the most common repeat length being 29. Homozygous 29/29 and heterozygous 28/29 were the most common genotypes, with 44 and 30% of the controls harboring these genotypes, respectively. Relative to subjects homozygous for 29 CAG/CAA repeats (29/29 genotype), individuals with the <29/29 genotype had a nonsignificant 31% increased risk [odds ratio (OR), 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-1.97], whereas those homozygous for the <29 allele had a significant 81% excess risk (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.00-3.28). The combined effect of CAG repeat lengths in the AR and AIB1/SRC-3 genes was also evaluated. Relative to men with both the 29/29 genotype of the AIB1/SRC-3 gene and a long CAG repeat length (> or =23) in the AR gene, those with both the <29/<29 AIB1/SRC-3 genotype and a short CAG repeat length in the AR gene (<23) had a 2.8-fold risk (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.24-6.26). Together, our data indicate that the CAG/CAA repeat length in the AIB1/SRC-3 gene may be associated with prostate cancer risk in Chinese men and that the combination of CAG/CAA repeat lengths in both the AIB1/SRC-3 and AR genes may provide a useful marker for clinically significant prostate cancer. Expanded studies in other populations are needed to confirm this association and the combined effect of AIB1/SRC-3 and other hormone-related genes in prostate cancer etiology.
The intravenous anesthetics which are commonly used for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) possess dose-dependent anticonvulsant properties. Since the clinical efficacy of ECT depends on the induction of a seizure of adequate duration, it is important to determine the optimal dose of the hypnotic for use during ECT. We compared the duration of seizure activity and cognitive recovery profiles after different doses of methohexital, propofol, and etomidate administered to induce hypnosis prior to ECT. Ten outpatients with major depressive disorders receiving maintenance ECT participated in this prospective, randomized, cross-over study. Patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate, 0.2 mg intravenously (i.v.), and labetalol, 20-30 mg i.v., and hypnosis was induced with an i.v. bolus injection of methohexital or propofol (0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg), or etomidate (0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg), administered over 10-15 s. Adequate muscle paralysis was achieved with succinylcholine, 1.0-1.4 mg/kg i.v. Each patient's seizure threshold was determined prior to enrollment in the study and the electrical stimulus variables were kept constant throughout the study period. After delivery of a bilateral electrical stimulus, the duration of the resulting electroencephalographic (EEG) and motor seizures were recorded. A total of 90 ECT treatments were evaluated. The durations of EEG and motor seizures were longest after etomidate and shortest after propofol. There were no significant dose-related differences in motor and EEG seizure durations (means +/- SD) after the low, intermediate, and high doses of etomidate of 44 +/- 11 and 77 +/- 19, 43 +/- 10 and 76 +/- 34, 42 +/- 16 and 78 +/- 56 s, respectively. Conversely, both methohexital and propofol, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg, produced dose-dependent decreases in motor and EEG seizure durations (i.e., 37 +/- 10 and 58 +/- 12, 36 +/- 8 and 62 +/- 24, and 29 +/- 13 and 48 +/- 20 for methohexital; 34 +/- 15 and 56 +/- 29, 31 +/- 8 and 50 +/- 17, and 20 +/- 6 and 33 +/- 12 for propofol, respectively). The awakening times were similar, regardless of the hypnotic or dose administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
We previously showed that a toxicogenomics analysis of drug-induced phospholipidosis enabled the identification of 12 specific gene markers and the establishment of an in vitro real-time PCR screening assay for the assessment of the phospholipidosis-inducing potential of compounds. The purpose of this study was to transfer our PCR-based assay into a 96-well microplate-based multiple mRNAs measuring assay (ArrayPlate assay) in order to increase throughput. Specifically, we determined the expression of the 12 marker genes using real-time PCR and ArrayPlate in human hepatoma HepG2 cells that were treated for 24h with each of amiodarone and 80 proprietary compounds. The following three performance criteria were satisfied in the ArrayPlate analysis: 1. Sensitivity-the expression of mRNA for all target genes was detected at quantifiable levels. 2. Repeatability-signal intensities and fold change values of each marker gene were highly repeatable. 3. Correlation-fold change values and their average values, which were used as indices of phospholipidosis induction potential, showed apparent correlation between the ArrayPlate and real-time PCR assays. Thus, the in vitro screening assay for compound-induced phospholipidosis should be transferable from a PCR-based assay to the higher-throughput ArrayPlate-based method.
The study was designed to characterize the mechanism of chloroquine-induced depression of contractility in isolated rat ileal smooth muscle. Chloroquine (10(-7)-10(-4) M) depressed both spontaneous as well as 10(-7) M acetylcholine-induced contractions dose-dependently. The decline in contractile responses to maximal dose of Ach (10(-6) M) in Ca-free medium was significantly increased by treatment with chloroquine. Restoration of Ca++ to Ach-stimulated "Ca-depleted" tissues produced contractions due to Ca++ influx; these contractions were prevented by chloroquine, dose-dependently. Using "Ca-loading" and "Ca-washing" procedures 10(-6) M Ach was observed to mobilize Ca++ from a "membrane-bound" pool, perhaps containing residual Ca++ of extracellular origin. Chloroquine significantly inhibited the rate of filling of such "membrane-bound" pool. The results show that chloroquine-induced depression of mechanical activity of the rat ileal smooth muscle is associated with diminished Ca++ influx, as well as impaired mobilization of Ca++ from an Ach-sensitive "membrane-bound" pool.
To assess the efficacy, plasma drug concentrations and adverse effects of a new sustained release preparation of procainamide, 33 patients with heart disease were studied in an acute dose-ranging protocol and a chronic treatment protocol. Patients initially received a daily dose of 3 g of sustained release procainamide; this dose was increased by 1.5 g daily until ventricular premature depolarizations were suppressed by 75 percent or more, adverse drug effects occurred or a total daily dose of 7.5 g of sustained-release procainamide was reached. Twenty-five patients (76 percent) had at least a 75 percent reduction (range 75 to 100percent [mean +/- standard deviation 91 +/- 8.2]) in ventricular permature depolarization frequency at a dosage of 4.8 +/- 1.46 g/day (range 3.0 to 7.5). Despite the 8 hour dosing interval, the variation between maximal and minimal plasma procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide concentrations under steady state conditions was very small. Mean maximal procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide plasma concentrations were 10.4 +/- 6.02 and 12.0 +/- 7.40 micrograms/ml, respectively. The respective mean minimal concentrations were 6.8 +/- 4.50 and 8.7 +/- 5.99 micrograms/ml. In nine patients (27 percent) treatment with sustained release procainamide resulted in conversion of the antinuclear antibody test from negative to positive. Adverse drug effects occurred in 17 (52 percent) of the subjects. In general, adverse effects were minor and abated within 24 hours after administration of the drug was stopped. One patient had the procainamide-induced systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome.
Mutations in aquaporin-2 (AQP2) that interfere with its cellular processing can produce autosomal recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Prior gene knock-in of the human NDI-causing AQP2 mutation T126M produced mutant mice that died by age 7 days. Here, we used a novel "conditional gene knock-in" strategy to generate adult, AQP2-T126M mutant mice. Mice separately heterozygous for floxed wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-T126M were bred to produce hemizygous mice, which following excision of the wild-type AQP2 gene by tamoxifen-induced Cre-recombinase gave AQP2(T126M/-) mice. AQP2(T126M/-) mice were polyuric (9-14 ml urine/day) compared to AQP2(+/+) mice (1.6 ml/day) and had reduced urine osmolality (400 vs. 1800 mosmol). Kidneys of AQP2(T126M/-) mice expressed core-glycosylated AQP2-T126M protein in an endoplasmic reticulum pattern. Screening of candidate protein folding "correctors" in AQP2-T126M-transfected kidney cells showed increased AQP2-T126M plasma membrane expression with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). 17-AAG increased urine osmolality in AQP2(T126M/-) mice by >300 mosmol but had no effect in AQP2(-/-) mice. Kidneys of 17-AAG-treated AQP2(T126M/-) mice showed partial rescue of defective AQP2-T126M cellular processing. Our results establish an adult mouse model of NDI and demonstrate partial restoration of urinary concentration function by a compound currently in clinical trials for other indications.
We report on a patient who developed life-threatening thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure after the reinstitution of rifampicin therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. This combined reaction is rarely reported. Supportive treatment and withdrawal of rifampicin led to complete recovery. The increased incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis and the need for the reintroduction of rifampicin therapy may lead to more such reactions being observed.
Haemoglobin levels often decline into the anaemic range with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We conducted a chart review of patients receiving ADT for metastatic prostate cancer to assess anaemia-related symptoms.
135 stage IV prostate cancer cases were reviewed for treatment type; haemoglobin values before and after treatment; and symptoms of anaemia. Mean haemoglobin levels before and after for all treatment forms, for leuprolide alone, and for combination leuprolide/bicalutamide were calculated and evaluated for significant differences. The numbers of patients developing symptoms were recorded and the effects of specific therapies evaluated.
For all ADT treated patients, mean haemoglobin declined by -1.11 g/dL (p<.0001). Leuprolide-alone treated patients had a mean decline of -1.66 g/dL (p<0.0001). Leuprolide and bicalutamide combination treatment caused a mean decline of -0.78 g/dL (p=0.0426). 16 of 43 patients had anemia symptoms. Contingency analysis with Fisher's exact test shows patients receiving leuprolide therapy alone versus other forms of ADT were significantly less likely to have symptoms (chi(2)=0.0190).
The present study confirms that ADT results in a significant drop in haemoglobin levels into the anaemic range. A number of patients become symptomatic from this change. Practitioners should monitor haemoglobin levels, and treat symptomatic patients.
