The disposition of benzbromarone and its uric acid lowering effect were investigated in 8 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis in order to obtain evidence whether dose requirements differ from subjects with normal liver function. Following a single oral dose of 100 mg benzbromarone, the plasma concentrations of the parent drug and the two hydroxylated main metabolites M1 and M2 as well as uric acid were determined up to at least 72 h. All patients were found to be rapid benzbromarone eliminators. In patients 2-8 the extent of systemic availability of benzbromarone, as estimated by the average AUC(0-infinite), was similar to previous observations in healthy individuals, whereas the values of both metabolites M1 and M2 tended to be lower in patients with liver cirrhosis. Cmax of benzbromarone and M1 also were lower in patients, M2 was equivalent to the data in subjects with normal liver function. tmax and the plasma elimination half-life t(1/2) varied within the same range as previously observed in healthy individuals. One patient exhibited much higher values in AUC(0-infinite); and Cmax of benzbromarone and both metabolites, and in addition of the elimination half-life of M1 and M2, whereas the plasma elimination of benzbromarone itself was not delayed. An effect of altered liver function cannot be excluded in this patient. Ten hours after benzbromarone administration the mean plasma uric acid in patients 2-8 was reduced by 31.5% and in patient 1 by 44.2% as compared to pretreatment values. Baseline levels were not regained until 72 h. These data are compatible with a prolonged uric acid lowering effect of an active benzbromarone metabolite. Altogether, the present observations do not suggest dose adjustment to be necessary in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis Child A and B.
Concern has arisen in recent years about indoor air pollution as a risk factor for asthma. Formaldehyde exposure was examined in relation to asthma among young children (between 6 months and 3 yrs old) in a population-based control study carried out in Perth, Western Australia, between 1997-1999. An association between exposure to formaldehyde and asthma in young children has been suggested. Cases (n=88), whose parents were recruited at Princess Margaret Hospital Accident and Emergency Dept (Perth, Western Australia), were children discharged with asthma as the primary diagnosis. Controls (n=104), who were children in the same age group without asthma diagnosed by a doctor, were identified from birth records through the Health Dept of Western Australia (Perth, Western Australia). Health outcomes for the children were studied using a respiratory questionnaire and skin-prick tests. Formaldehyde, average temperature and relative humidity were measured on two occasions, winter (July-September 1998) and summer (December 1998-March 1999) in the child's bedroom and in the living room. The study found seasonal differences in formaldehyde levels in the children's bedrooms and living rooms with significantly greater formaldehyde exposure during the summer period for case and control subjects. The generalised estimating equation model showed that children exposed to formaldehyde levels of > or = 60 microg x m(-3) are at increased risk of having asthma. The results suggest that domestic exposure to formaldehyde increases the risk of childhood asthma.
Neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions are thought to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastropathy.
To optimise a mouse model of NSAID induced gastropathy and to evaluate the importance of adhesion molecules using adhesion molecule deficient mice.
Gastropathy was induced in C57BL/6 mice or their adhesion molecule deficient counterparts via oral administration of indomethacin (20 mg/kg). Lesion scores, mucosal permeability, and histopathology were used to assess gastric mucosal injury.
Intragastric administration of indomethacin induced linear haemorrhagic mucosal lesions, primarily in the corpus of the stomach that were first observed at six hours. These lesions continued to develop over the next six hours with maximal lesion scores and mucosal permeabilities at 12 hours. When indomethacin was administered to mice deficient in CD18, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), or P-selectin, there were significant decreases in lesion scores compared with their C57BL/6 controls. In addition, mucosal permeabilities were found to be significantly lower in CD18 or ICAM-1 deficient mice observed at 12 hours.
Certain leucocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules are important determinants for full expression of indomethacin induced gastropathy. It is proposed that this modification of the mouse model may be useful for the investigation of other pathophysiological mechanisms of NSAID induced gastropathy.
The influence of prenatal cocaine exposure on children's language functioning was evaluated longitudinally at six time points from 4 months to 3 years of age. The Miami Prenatal Cocaine Study prospectively enrolled 476 full-term African-American infants at birth, categorized as cocaine-exposed (n = 253) or non-cocaine-exposed (n = 223) by maternal self-report and bioassays (maternal/infant urine, meconium). The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, scored using the Kent Scoring Adaptation for language, was administered at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months. The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool was administered at 3 years. In longitudinal analyses using Generalized Estimating Equations, cocaine-exposed children had lower overall language skills than non-cocaine-exposed children (D = -0.151; 95% CI = -0.269, -0.033; p =.012). Longitudinal findings remained stable after evaluation of potential confounding influences including other prenatal substance exposures and sociodemographic factors. Preliminary evidence also indicated possible mediation through an intermediary effect involving cocaine-associated deficits in fetal growth.
Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, has been used in the treatment of obsessive neurosis successfully. In the course of treatment with this medication, sexual disorders in the form of decreased libido and impotence were noticed in three patients whose cases are reported. These disturbances occurred in the first week and lasted during the course of treatment. Upon withdrawal of the medication, the side effects disappeared. These side effects seem to be more common than is usually thought. The physician should be alerted to them as they can be a source of noncompliance.
A 40-year-old female with a lumbar drain was admitted to the neurosurgery service with a bacterial meningitis. During the course of her treatment with multiple central nervous system (CNS) active medications, the patient became disoriented and agitated with visual hallucinations and generalized myoclonus. A psychiatric consultation was requested. The case is presented and discussed within the context of the importance of understanding etiological mechanisms in treating and reversing delirium. The fluoroquinolone agent ciprofloxacin was considered to be the primary etiology of the patient's delirium. This class of medication as a cause of altered mental status is discussed.
Mirtazapine is a novel antidepressant with a pharmacologic profile (alpha-2 antagonist, 5HT-(1A) agonist, and 5HT-(2) antagonist) that renders it potentially useful for l-dopa-induced dyskinesias. Drugs with 5HT-(1A) agonistic activity, such as buspirone and tandospirone, have been reported to be effective in reducing l-dopa-induced dyskinesias. Furthermore, 5HT-(2) antagonism may, by reducing substantia nigra pars reticulata hyperactivity, play a role in the improvement of Parkinsonian symptoms and l-dopa-induced dyskinesias, as has been observed with ritanserin, a 5HT-(2) antagonist. Alpha-2 antagonists, such as idazoxan, have recently also been reported to improve l-dopa-induced dyskinesias. The authors investigated the antidyskinetic properties of mirtazapine by designing an open-label study of 20 Parkinsonian patients with l-dopa-induced dyskinesias. Mirtazapine proved to be moderately effective in reducing l-dopa-induced dyskinesias, either alone or in association with amantadine. Mirtazapine may be of use in patients who do not respond or are intolerant to amantadine.
Hybrid mice having had 12 weeks free access to flavored alcohol were deprived of it for 3 days. The increase in alcohol intake rate during first 1.5 h of renewal access as compared with its intake rate during the remaining 22.5 h (alcohol-deprivation effect, ADE) was used to select individuals having (HD) or lacking (LD) the ADE. The mice received morphine or placebo pellet implantation for 4 days followed by removal of alcohol and pellets. Cross-maze, acoustic startle response, and tail flick tests were conducted 1 day after morphine withdrawal and after 2 days of alcohol deprivation. Next day, during a second ADE test, placebo-treated HDs again showed ADE and LDs showed no ADE; the HDs during morphine withdrawal also still showed an ADE similar to those in placebo HDs, but LDs after morphine removal differed in showing an ADE. Significantly more hyperalgesia in HD than LD mice was observed during morphine withdrawal. Placebo HDs differed from placebo LDs in showing stereotyped behavior and kindling-like rise in acoustic startle response. Morphine withdrawal caused body weight loss, and converted the startle response curve in both LD and HD mice to a bell-shape curve. In HD mice the alcohol deprivation behavioral pattern was substituted by the corresponding morphine withdrawal pattern. The existence of distinct neural circuits responsible for the development of alcohol and morphine dependence is proposed.
Carbamazepine is a well-established, effective treatment of complex partial seizures and is well tolerated in most patients. The adverse effects of carbamazepine include aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, and peripheral edema. Hypertension or hypotension has also rarely been documented in patients with either therapeutic or toxic blood levels of carbamazepine. It is possible that carbamazepine-induced hypertension in those with therapeutic blood levels is rarely seen because most of the patients who begin treatment are young and do not have baseline hypertension. The authors describe a patient of African-American descent with a history of controlled essential hypertension who developed severe uncontrolled hypertension when started on carbamazepine. Treatment with additional antihypertensive medications did not reduce his blood pressure. In addition, he developed two episodes of transient neurologic deficits, the symptoms of which consisted of dysarthria, vertigo, and unstable gait. A substantial reduction of his carbamazepine dose resulted in the control of his blood pressure and no recurrence of his symptoms.
Susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity has been attributed to possession of the specific human leukocyte antigen allele HLA-B*57:01. HLA-B*57:01-restricted activation of CD8+ T-cells provides a link between the genetic association and the iatrogenic disease. The objectives of this study were to characterize the functionality of drug-responsive CD8+ T-cell clones generated from HLA-B*57:01+ drug-naive subjects and to explore the relationship between abacavir accumulation in antigen presenting cells and the T-cell response. Seventy-four CD8+ clones expressing different Vβ receptors were shown to proliferate and kill target cells via different mechanisms when exposed to abacavir. Certain clones were activated with abacavir in the absence of antigen presenting cells. Analysis of the remaining clones revealed two pathways of drug-dependent T-cell activation. Overnight incubation of antigen presenting cells with abacavir, followed by repeated washing to remove soluble drug, activated approximately 50% of the clones, and the response was blocked by glutaraldehyde fixation. In contrast, a 1 h antigen presenting cell pulse did not activate any of the clones. Accumulation of abacavir in antigen presenting cells was rapid (less than 1 h), and the intracellular concentrations were maintained for 16 h. However, intracellular abacavir was not detectable by mass spectrometry after pulsing. These data suggest that T-cells can be activated by abacavir through a direct interaction with surface and intracellular major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. With the former, abacavir seemingly participates in the MHC T-cell receptor binding interaction. In contrast, the latter pathway likely involves MHC binding peptides displayed as a consequence of abacavir exposure, but not abacavir itself.
The World Health Organization advocates 2-3 doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria (SP IPTp). The optimal number of doses and the consequences of single-dose therapy remain unclear.
Data were from a randomized, controlled study of human immunodeficiency virus-positive Zambian women comparing monthly versus 2-dose SP IPTp. We compared maternal and neonatal birth outcomes as a function of how many doses the mothers received (1 to > or =4 doses).
Of 387 deliveries, 34 received 1 dose of SP. Single-dose SP was significantly associated with higher proportions of maternal anemia, peripheral and cord blood parasitemia, infant prematurity, and low birth weight. SP conferred dose-dependent benefits, particularly in the transition from 1 to 2 doses of SP. Women randomized to the standard 2-dose regimen were much more likely to receive only 1 dose than were women randomized to monthly IPT (relative risk, 16.4 [95% confidence interval, 4.0-68.3]).
Single-dose SP was a common result of trying to implement the standard 2-dose regimen and was inferior to all other dosing regimens. At a programmatic level, this implies that monthly SP IPTp may ultimately be more effective than the standard regimen by reducing the risk of inadvertently underdosing mothers.
Intermittent preventive treatment aims to maximize the protective effects of malaria chemoprophylaxis while minimizing the deleterious effects.
In Gabon, 1189 infants received either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; 250 and 12.5 mg, respectively) or placebo at 3, 9, and 15 months of age. Children were actively followed-up until 18 months of age.
In the intention-to-treat population at 18 months of follow-up, 84 children (17%) in the SP group had > or =1 episode of anemia, versus 108 (21%) in the placebo group (protective efficacy, 22% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -1% to 40%]; P=.06). In the intervention group, there were 66 episodes during 485 person-years at risk, compared with 79 episodes during 497 years in the placebo group (protective efficacy, 17% [95% CI, -24% to 45%; P=.36). The effects were similar at 12 months of follow-up. The study drug was safe and well tolerated.
The intervention was efficacious, producing a reduction in risk for anemia but a smaller effect against malaria. It is a valuable additional tool to control malaria in a highly vulnerable age group. Remaining important questions are currently being addressed in further studies.

The inflammasome is a cytosolic protein complex regulating the activation of caspase-1, which cleaves the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 into their active form. The inflammasome is composed of a NACHT-, LRR- and pyrin (NALP) family member that acts as a sensor for danger signals and the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain (ASC), which allows the recruitment of caspase-1 in the complex. In the skin, exposure to contact sensitizers (CS) such as trinitro-chlorobenzene causes an immune response called contact hypersensitivity (CHS) or eczema. In this delayed-type hypersensitivity response, efficient priming of the adaptive immunity depends on the concomitant activation of the innate immune system, including IL-1beta/IL-18 activation in the skin. To determine if the inflammasome contributes to CHS, we have analyzed its capacity to react to CS in vitro and in vivo. We show here that key components of the inflammasome are present in human keratinocytes and that CS like trinitro-chlorobenzene induce caspase-1/ASC dependent IL-1beta and IL-18 processing and secretion. We also show that ASC- and NALP3-deficient mice display an impaired response to CS. These findings suggest that CS act as danger signals that activate the inflammasome in the skin, and reveal a new role of NALP3 and ASC as regulators of innate immunity in CHS.
Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) reduces placental infection, maternal anemia, and low birth weight (LBW). However, the optimal dosing regimen in settings in which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is highly prevalent among pregnant women remains controversial.
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of IPTp comparing the standard 2-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) regimen with monthly IPTp among a cohort of HIV-positive pregnant Zambian women. Primary outcomes included placental malaria (by smear and histology) and maternal peripheral parasitemia at delivery.
There were no differences between monthly IPTp (n=224) and standard IPTp (n=232) in placental malaria by histopathology (26% vs. 29%; relative risk [RR], 0.90 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.64-1.26]) or placental parasitemia (2% vs. 4%; RR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.17-1.79]). There also were no differences in maternal anemia, stillbirths, preterm delivery, LBW, or all-cause mortality of infants at 6 weeks.
In an area of mesoendemicity in Zambia, monthly SP IPTp was not more efficacious than the standard 2-dose regimen for the prevention of placental malaria or adverse birth outcomes. IPTp policy recommendations need to take into account local malaria transmission patterns and the prevalence of HIV.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00270530.
A severe prolonged illness that was characterized by deep jaundice and debilitating pruritus occurred in five patients after the use of flucloxacillin. The symptoms and signs of liver disease took at least two months to resolve; after four- to nine-months' follow-up, liver enzyme activities have remained abnormal in all patients. Examination of liver biopsy specimens showed severe cholestasis in all cases, with evidence of significant bile-duct injury in three cases. In one patient, in whom symptoms have persisted for nine months, examination of a liver biopsy specimen showed marked bile-duct depletion. All patients were seen during a four-month period and it is felt that flucloxacillin-induced liver disease probably has been under-diagnosed and underreported. The use of flucloxacillin has been increasing rapidly and it is anticipated that more cases of flucloxacillin hepatotoxicity will occur in the future.
Cancer cells, characterized by local invasion and distant metastasis, are very much dependent on the extracellular matrix. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been implicated in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. In this study, we reported the effects of disulfiram, a clinically used anti-alcoholism drug, on tumor invasion suppression, as well as its effects on the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS). Disulfiram has been used for alcohol aversion therapy. However, recent reports have shown that disulfiram may have potential in the treatment of human cancers. Herewith, we showed that the anti-tumor effects of disulfiram, in an invasion assay using U2OS cells and that disulfiram has a type IV collagenase inhibitory activity that inhibits expression of genes and proteins responsible for both cell and non-cell mediated invasion on pathways. In conclusion, disulfiram inhibited expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and it regulated the invasion of human osteosarcoma cells. These observations raise the possibility of disulfiram being used clinical for the inhibition of cancer invasion.
The serotonin transporter gene (HTT) is a primary candidate in autistic disorder based on efficacy of potent serotonin transporter inhibitors in reducing rituals and routines. We initiated a candidate gene study of HTT in trios consisting of probands with autistic disorder and both parents. Preliminary transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis with 86 families revealed no evidence for linkage or linkage disequilibrium between autistic disorder and a polymorphism in the second intron of HTT. However, preferential transmission of a short variant of the HTT promoter was found in the same 86 trios (TDT chi 2 = 4.69, 1 d.f., P = 0.030). In further analyses, we considered haplotypes of the HTT promoter variant and second intron locus as alleles in a multiallelic TDT. Results confirmed the significance of the effect of this region (TDT chi 2 = 11.85, 4 d.f., P = 0.018). This provides preliminary evidence of linkage and association between HTT and autistic disorder.
Methylmercury (MeHg) is an environmental toxin which induces cell death specific for the nervous systems. Here we show that MeHg causes neuronal cell death through the suppression of the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) pathway, and that compounds activating the TrkA pathway prevent MeHg-induced nerve damage in vitro and in vivo. We first investigated the mechanism of MeHg-induced neurotoxicity in differentiating neurons using PC12 cells. Exposure to 100nM MeHg for 1day induced apoptosis in differentiating PC12 cells. Further, MeHg-induced apoptosis was preceded by inhibition of neurite extension, as determined by ELISA analyses of the neurite-specific protein neurofilament triplet H protein (NF-H). To determine the mechanism of MeHg-induced apoptosis, we evaluated the effects of MeHg on the TrkA pathway, which is known to regulate neuronal differentiation and viability. Western blot analysis demonstrated that, like the TrkA phosphorylation inhibitor K252a, MeHg inhibited phosphorylation of TrkA and its downstream effectors. Furthermore, GM1 ganglioside and its analog MCC-257, which enhance TrkA phosphorylation, overcame the effect of MeHg in neurons, supporting the involvement of the TrkA pathway in MeHg-induced nerve damage. Finally, we demonstrated that MCC-257 rescued the clinical sign and pathological changes in MeHg-exposed rats. These findings indicate that MeHg-induced apoptosis in neuron is triggered by inhibition of the TrkA pathway, and that GM1 ganglioside and MCC-257 effectively prevent MeHg-induced nerve damage.
Estrogens are known to activate the phosphatidyl-inosityl 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is central in the cardioprotection afforded by ischemic postconditioning. Therefore, our goal was to investigate whether a phytoestrogen, genistein, could induce a pharmacological postconditioning and to investigate potential mechanisms. We used low doses of genistein in order to avoid tyrosine kinases inhibition. Thus, pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbits underwent a coronary artery occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Prior to reperfusion, they randomly received an i.v. injection of either saline (Control), 100 or 1000 microg/kg of genistein (Geni(100) and Geni(1000), respectively), and 10 or 100 microg/kg of 17beta-estradiol (17beta(10) and 17beta(100), respectively). Infarct size (IS, % area at risk) was significantly reduced in Gen(100), Gen(1000) and 17beta(100) but not in 17beta(10) (6+/-2, 16+/-5, 12+/-3 and 29+/-7%, respectively) vs. Control (35+/-4%). A significant decrease in the percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei within infarcted area was observed in Gen(100) and 17beta(100) vs. Controls. The estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant (1 mg/kg i.v.) and the PI3K inhibitor wortmaninn (0.6 mg/kg) abolished the cardioprotective effect of genistein. Western blots also demonstrated an increase in Akt posphorylation in Gen(100). In the same group, in vitro mitochondrial swelling studies demonstrated a significant inhibition of calcium-induced opening of mitochondrial transition pore vs. Controls. In conclusion, genistein exerts pharmacological postconditioning with a similar potency as 17beta-estradiol through a pathway involving activation of the estrogen receptor, of PI3K/Akt and mitochondrial preservation. Therefore, genistein should not be only considered as an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase but also as a cardioprotective estrogen.
Overactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in response to genotoxic insults can cause cell death by energy deprivation. We previously reported that neurotoxic amounts of kainic acid (KA) injected into the rat striatum produce time-dependent changes in striatal PARP activity in vivo. Here, we have investigated the time-course of KA-induced toxicity and the effects of the PARP inhibitor benzamide on KA, AMPA and NMDA neurotoxicities in vivo, by measuring changes in the volume of the lesion and in NAD+ and ATP levels induced by the intra-striatal injection of these excitotoxins in C57Bl/6N mice. The KA-induced lesion volume was dependent on the amount of toxin injected and the survival time. The lesion was well developed at 48 h and was almost undetectable after one week. KA produced an extensive astrogliosis at one week. Benzamide partially prevented both KA- and NMDA- but not AMPA-induced lesions when measured at 48 h after the treatment. The effects of benzamide appeared to be in part related to changes in energy metabolism, since KA produced decreases in striatal levels of NAD+ and ATP that were partially prevented by benzamide at 48 h and which returned to control levels at one week. NMDA did not affect NAD+ and induced little alteration in ATP levels. Benzamide had no effect on AMPA-induced decreases in either NAD+ or ATP levels at 48 h. These results (1) indicate that PARP overactivation and energy depletion could be responsible in part for the cellular demise during the development of the lesion induced by KA; (2) confirm that PARP is involved in NMDA but not AMPA toxicities; (3) suggest the existence of differences between KA and AMPA-mediated toxicities; and (4) provide further evidence supporting PARP as a novel target for new drug treatments against neurodegenerative disorders.
We evaluated the incidence of ventricular fibrillation with low-osmolality contrast media by right coronary arteriography in eleven adult mongrel dogs. Following insertion of the catheter into the right coronary artery, a test solution was infused for 25 seconds (total 11 mL) or until fibrillation occurred. The test solutions included 20% mannitol, ioxaglate, iopamidol, iotrolan, and sodium iopamidol, which contained 150 mEq/L sodium in solution. The incidences of ventricular fibrillation were 0% with iotrolan, 8.3% with sodium iopamidol, 10% with ioxaglate, and 100% with iopamidol and mannitol. These observations suggest that the absence of sodium ions is a critical factor in fibrillation, even in low-osmolality contrast media. The fact that iotrolan had the least arrhythmogenic property may be attributed to the 8 mEq/L of sodium ions in that agent.
Cerebral microbleeds (MB) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic drugs. Insights could be gained by pooling data on MB frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with ICH and ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA).
We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or TIA to compare the presence of MB in: (1) antithrombotic users vs nonantithrombotic users with ICH; (2) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with IS/TIA; and (3) ICH vs ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use. We also analyzed published and unpublished follow-up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with MB.
In a pooled analysis of 1460 ICH and 3817 IS/TIA, MB were more frequent in ICH vs IS/TIA in all treatment groups, but the excess increased from 2.8 (odds ratio; range, 2.3-3.5) in nonantithrombotic users to 5.7 (range, 3.4-9.7) in antiplatelet users and 8.0 (range, 3.5-17.8) in warfarin users (P difference=0.01). There was also an excess of MB in warfarin users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; P<0.001) but none in warfarin users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.7; P=0.33; P difference=0.01). There was a smaller excess of MB in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3; P<0.001), but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7; P<0.001; P difference=0.25). In pooled follow-up data for 768 antithrombotic users, presence of MB at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ICH (OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 3.4-42.5; P<0.001).
The excess of MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increase the risk of warfarin-associated ICH. Limited prospective data corroborate these findings, but larger prospective studies are urgently required.
Three men, aged 18, 21 and 27 years, underwent surgery for atrial septal defect of the ostium secundum. All had bilateral absence of the forearm and thumb, with the rest of the hand directly attached to the upper arm. The patients had been exposed to synthetic progestogens during early intrauterine development. The oldest patient is described, together with a 6-year-old boy with limb reduction and Fallot's tetralogy who was exposed to the contraceptive pill during the first 2 months of gestation. During surgery he was found to have atrial septal defect of the ostium secundum. The most plausible diagnosis in such cases is the Holt-Oram syndrome, but the teratogenic effect of the synthetic hormones may be an important aetiological factor. Both hypotheses are discussed.
The effectiveness of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, was evaluated in a randomized double-blind clinical study in which diazepam 0.2 mg kg-1 or midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 was used for i.v. sedation. We studied 120 day-case patients undergoing gastroscopy and treated with either flumazenil 0.1-2 mg or placebo after the procedure. Psychometric assessment of four aspects of recovery over a 3-h period showed that flumazenil attenuated the sedative effects of the benzodiazepines, but did not antagonize the sedation completely. For patients sedated with diazepam, there was a significant effect of flumazenil on speed of motor co-ordination after 90 min (P less than 0.01), and for those given midazolam a similar effect was found at 20 min (P less than 0.01). However, after 3 h all four groups of patients had not returned to baseline performance in accuracy of motor co-ordination (P less than 0.01) and cortical arousal (P less than 0.05), and the two groups sedated with diazepam still displayed memory deficits (P less than 0.05). Flumazenil did not attenuate the subjective experience of sedation as measured by visual analogue scales. These results indicate that sedation is multidimensional, differentially affecting the hierarchy of cognitive functions. In day-cases, antagonism of benzodiazepine sedation with flumazenil would not hasten the safe discharge of patients.
We report a case of angioedema caused by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and topical lignocaine spray, administered during nasendoscopy. Angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a rare but well known entity. Allergy to topical lignocaine has been acknowledged as a rare phenomenon when used for dental surgery and for skin anaesthesia, but it has not previously been reported after topical administration prior to nasendoscopy. In the reported case, our patient was unfortunate enough to be allergic to both lisinopril and lignocaine. The result was life-threatening airway obstruction, and the continued use of lignocaine spray sustained the laryngeal oedema. We advise that patients are asked about any and every allergy--specifically, any previous problems with dental procedures--before administration of local anaesthetic spray to the upper aerodigestive tract.
Changes of regional myocardial perfusion before and after administration of Atenolol (AT) (5 mg i.v.) were investigated by 201-Tl stress-imaging in 14 patients (PAT) with greater than or equal to 70% coronary obstructions. Scintigrams were performed in 4 projections (AP, 30 degree LAO, 60 degrees LAO, left lateral); scintigraphic defects (SD) in one of the 6 LV segments (anterior, apical, inferior, septal, lateral, posterior) had to be identified in at least 2 projections and to show a decrease of activity greater than or equal to 25%. All PAT had at least one reversible SD.
After AT, stress, induced SDs were unchanged in 11 of the 14 PAT at identical work loads (131 Watt). The total number of reversible defects was 33 before and 28 after AT (n.s.). However, not only the 3 PAT with improved stress scintigrams, but also 6 of the 11 PAT with unchanged abnormal stress scintigrams were clinically improved (ECG normalized, no angina). Thus in almost half of the patients (6/14), the stress ECG was normalized without normalization of perfusion pattern of thallium scintigrams. We conclude that in these patients subendocardial perfusion was enough improved to meet the reduced metabolic needs, but not enough to normalize stress images.
In three cebus monkeys the chronic daily administration of haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg/day orally) created sedation and parkinsonism during the first 5-7 weeks. Later the animals developed signs reminiscent of acute dystonia, as seen in the clinic during treatment with neuroleptics. These signs were dose-dependent and in extreme cases included widespread tonic and clonic seizures. After 3 and 12 months, respectively, two of the cebus monkeys developed buccolingual signs (grimacing and tongue protrusion), similar to tardive dyskinesia in the clinic. The tardive dyskinesia symptoms were reduced in a dose-dependent manner after each haloperidol administration, being most pronounced in the morning before haloperidol was given. Biperiden reduced acute dystonia but reinstated signs of tardive dyskinesia, which had been abolished by haloperidol. It is suggested that cebus monkeys may provide a useful animal model for the study of neurologic long-term complications from neuroleptic drugs.
Forty patients undergoing elective Caesarean section were allocated randomly to receive hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine 2.5 ml at either the L2-3 (n = 20) or L4-5 (n = 20) interspace. Spinal injection was performed with a 29-gauge needle in 38 patients and a 25-gauge needle in two. The onset time to analgesia at T10 and T6 was significantly faster and the level of analgesia at 5 and 10 min after injection significantly higher after injection at L2-3. Maximum height and range of analgesia, the level of analgesia at 15 and 20 min after injection and the number of episodes of hypotension were not significantly different between the two groups. One case of post-dural puncture headache was recorded after use of a 29-gauge needle. Overall, the choice of lumbar interspace influenced the rate of onset of analgesia, but not the final dermatomal level (mean and range) of analgesia achieved.
The electrophysiological and haemodynamic effects of lidocaine (100 mg) and ajmaline (50 mg) were evaluated while attempting to interrupt sustained ventricular tachycardia. The study was performed as a prospective, non-blinded, randomized investigation in 61 patients. Lidocaine terminated ventricular tachycardia in four of 31 patients, ajmaline in 19 of 30 patients (P less than 0.001). QRS and RR intervals during ventricular tachycardia were prolonged by ajmaline from 164 +/- 28 ms to 214 +/- 49 ms and from 371 +/- 86 ms to 479 +/- 137 ms (P less than 0.001), respectively; lidocaine did not influence these parameters. The duration of the return cycles after termination of ventricular tachycardia did not differ between the two groups. Lidocaine did not change cardiac output during ventricular tachycardia whereas cardiac output increased significantly under ajmaline from 3.5 +/- 1.21.min-1 to 5.5 +/- 1.91.min-1 (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that anti-arrhythmic agents such as ajmaline, which slow conduction velocity and prolong refractoriness, are more effective than lidocaine in the medical treatment of haemodynamically stable, sustained ventricular tachycardia.
The authors report two cases of benign liver tumors which were histopathologically diagnosed as liver adenomas. Both patients had a former history of taking oral contraceptives. The authors carry out a critical review of the literature up until the present day and evaluate the data which exist for and against the relationship between oral contraceptives and hepatic tumors. These are based mainly on suggestive clinical observations and on experimental studies with animals, and also on the structural affinity of oral contraceptives with androgen compounds. The latter are drugs that are very much implicated in the genesis of hepatic tumors. A criticism is made on the terminology used, from a histological point of view, to describe the tumor lesions that are related to oral contraceptives; the presence of dilated vessels with find walls and the existence of hepatic peliosis inside of such tumors are emphasized. The clinical presentation of these tumors is reviewed very briefly and the authors conclude that oral contraceptives have a close relationship with the appearance of liver tumors, either inducing them directly, or at least, helping them to grow.
