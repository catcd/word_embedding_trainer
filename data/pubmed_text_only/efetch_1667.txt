Uptake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves the treatment of cancer and reduces tumor-associated macrophage count. However, the mechanism of this relationship is still unclear. In this study, macrophages enhanced gastric cancer cell migration ability and induced the differentially expressed matrix metalloproteinase genes (MMP1, MMP3 and MMP10) of N87 as identified by polymerase chain reaction array. Furthermore, DHA and EPA inhibited macrophage-enhanced cancer cell migration and attenuated MMP10 at both the RNA and protein level. The suppression of MMP10 expression was further verified by zymography and antibody blocking experiments. Additionally, DHA and EPA attenuated expression of macrophage-activated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) in cancer cells. Attenuation was verified by demonstrating blockade with specific inhibitors and thereby increased MMP10 expression. Accordingly, we hypothesized that macrophage enhances cancer cell migration through ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent increased MMP10 expression and that DHA and EPA could attenuate these signals. These findings not only explain the beneficial effects of DHA/EPA, but also point to ERK/STAT3/MMP10 as the potential targets for gastric cancer treatment.
We report on a patient who developed severe lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) and neurotoxicity, despite recommended serum lithium levels. Hydrochlorothiazide and indomethacin appeared effective antipolyuric drugs, which led to a normalization of serum osmolality. After re-initiating lithium therapy, with lithium levels around 0.3 mmol/l, recurrence of NDI or neurotoxicity was not observed, despite discontinuation of indomethacin and hydrochlorothiazide. Together with hypothyroidism, NDI and neurotoxicity must be considered in lethargic lithium-treated patients.
Norepinephrine (NE)-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes is an important cause of heart failure. Previous studies revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), a well-known mediator that stimulates apoptosis, is not only produced by macrophages but also by cardiomyocytes. Until now, the role of TNF and its relationship to ROS in NE-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes have never been investigated.
Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with various concentrations of NE. Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was determined using the TUNEL assay. The level of secreted TNF was measured by ELISA and TNF mRNA expression was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction. Caspase activity was measured by a fluorogenic protease assay kit. Anti-TNF antibodies, caspase inhibitors and antioxidants (N-acetyl-L-cysteine or vitamin C) were added to determine if they could inhibit the apoptotic effect of NE.
NE induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. NE up-regulated TNF mRNA expression and increased TNF secretion and caspase-2,-3,-6, and -9 activities. A neutralizing anti-TNF antibody and caspase-2 and -3 inhibitors significantly attenuated NE-induced apoptosis. Antioxidants completely abrogated NE-induced TNF secretion, caspase activation, and apoptotic death.
NE induced apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes through a ROS-TNF-caspase signaling pathway.
We investigated the effects of benidipine hydrochloride (benidipine, Coniel) on blood pressure, heart rate and plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration in spontaneously hypertensive rats and compared them with those of other calcium channel blockers. Benidipine (2 mg/kg, p.o.) was compared with the equihypotensive doses of nifedipine (5 mg/kg), cilnidipine (6 mg/kg) and amlodipine (3 mg/kg). All the 4 calcium channel blockers exhibited significant antihypertensive effects. Nifedipine and cilinidipine significantly increased heart rate, as compared with that in the control group, whereas benidipine or amlodipine did not significantly affect it. The area under the curves for hypotensive effect and tachycardic effect for 10 hr after the drug administration were compared among the 4 compounds. As a result, the tachycardic effect of benidipine was significantly lower than those of nifedipine, cilnidipine and amlodipine, while the hypotensive effects were similar among the 4 compounds. Nifedipine and amlodipine, significantly increased plasma NE concentration, cilnidipine tended to increase it. In contrast, benidipine did not significantly affect plasma NE concentration. These results suggest that the effects of benidipine on plasma NE concentration and heart rate are less prominent than those of the other calcium channel blockers.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate target gene expression through translation repression or messenger RNA degradation. MiR-15a and 16-1 form a cluster at the chromosomal region 13q14, which is frequently deleted or down-regulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3), ATO) has been successfully applied to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Its combination with other drugs presented therapeutic activities in hematologic and solid tumors. Here we investigated the potential synergy between miR-15a/16-1 and ATO on Bcr-Abl positive leukemic K562 cells. In this study, we found that combination of miR-15a/16-1 and ATO synergistically induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 cells. The apoptosis, at least in part, through regulating mitochondrial function including the release of cytochrome c and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, also activation of caspase-3 and degradation of poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase. However, the expression of Bcr-Abl was not affected by ATO and/or miR-15a/16-1. Moreover, apoptotic synergy between miR-15a/16-1 and ATO was observed in Bcr-Abl negative leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells. Taken together, these findings suggested that the combined regiment of miR-15a/16-1 and ATO might be a potential therapeutic remedy for the treatment of leukemia.
3 patients with multiple myeloma developed hyperkalemic hypoaldosteronism and renal insufficiency while receiving indomethacin for bone pain. Claims are made that indomethacin has been responsible for these complications, possibly by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis. Careful observation of myeloma patients during administration of this agent and perhaps other prostaglandin inhibitors appears warranted.
Marked fluctuation of dopamine concentration in the striatum following long-term L-DOPA administration contributes to the development of L-DOPA-induced motor complications including L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias and wearing-off in patients with Parkinson's disease. We have shown that pretreatment with 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor agonist, alleviates fluctuation of dopamine levels in the dopamine-denervated striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned (hemiparkinsonian) rats after L-DOPA treatment. To determine whether co-administration of 8-OH-DPAT with L-DOPA prevents L-DOPA-induced motor complications, we examined rotation behavior and levels of messenger RNAs coding for dynorphin and glutamic acid decarboxylase in the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats treated with L-DOPA alone or L-DOPA + 8-OH-DPAT, twice daily, for 2 weeks. Co-administration of 8-OH-DPAT inhibited an increase of rotation behavior to L-DOPA and L-DOPA-induced increases in levels of messenger RNAs coding for dynorphin and glutamic acid decarboxylase in the dopamine-denervated striatum, both of which are established indices of L-DOPA-induced motor complications. These results suggest that pharmaceutical products that stimulate 5-HT1A receptors could prove useful in prevention of the development of L-DOPA-induced motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease.
In conscious rats with normal arterial blood pressure or with spontaneous or DOC induced hypertension, effects of drugs increasing (cycloserine, ethanolamine-o-sulphate, piracetam, chlordesmethyldiazepam) or depressing (bicuculline, Ro 15-1788, PK 11195) GABAergic reactivity were evaluated on the arterial hypotension and sinus bradycardia induced by clonidine. Clonidine was administered orally by gastric gavage (0.1-1 mg/kg). Pretreatment with cycloserine, ethanolamine-o-sulphate, piracetam or chlordesmethyldiazepam increased the hypotension and sinus bradycardia induced by clonidine. On the contrary, pretreatment with bicuculline or Ro 15-1788 reduced the cardiovascular effects of clonidine. These results suggest that the GABAergic system is involved in cardiovascular effects of clonidine in normotensive and hypertensive rats.
The cellular mechanisms following myocardial infarction remain poorly characterized. It is believed that an inflammatory and immunologic process may be involved and that the beneficial effects of enalapril on remodeling may, in part, work through an immune mechanism. To characterize the effect of enalapril on immune alterations in the late phase of ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction, rats underwent left coronary artery ligation followed by 6 weeks of either enalapril or placebo treatment. Infarct sizes, heart weights, and volumes were compared. Peripheral and splenic leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets, along with T cell blastogenesis, were quantified in enalapril treated rats 6 weeks after coronary ligation and compared to untreated control rats. Additionally, antibody production to a de novo antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, was assessed with and without treatment. Average infarct size was equivalent among enalapril-treated myocardial infarction rats and untreated infarct rats. There was, however, less left and right ventricular hypertrophy in the enalapril treated group. Enalapril completely prevented the 42% increase in white blood count, the 88% increase in neutrophils, and the 28% increase in lymphocyte count seen in untreated infarct rats. Both untreated and enalapril treated rats tended toward a decrease in T helper:suppressor ratio. All rats treated with enalapril, however, had a significant increase in the T helper:suppressor ratio versus untreated control rats (F = 3.6, P = .018). Blastogenesis was markedly increased in T cells from infarcted animals. This was mitigated by treatment with enalapril. Additionally, immunoglobulin G antibody production was significantly lessened in rats treated with enalapril. The results of this study suggest that alterations in immunoregulatory cell type and function occurs following myocardial infarction. The beneficial effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril may be, in part, due to its mitigating effects on immune cell release and activation following myocardial infarction.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Development of drug resistance against clinical anti-HBV drug lamivudine due to long-term use and rebound of viral DNA after cessation of treatment has been a major setback of the current therapy. We have synthesized a series of pyrimidine nucleosides possessing a variety of substituents at the C-5 position, and a 1-[(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy)methyl] flexible acyclic glycosyl moiety at the N-1 position, that have the ability to mimic the natural 2'-deoxyribosyl moiety. Some of these potential antiviral compounds included variations at both C-5 and C-6 positions of the uracil base. Other variations of the uracil derivatives were the 6-aza congeners. 4-Amino and 4-methoxy pyrimidine derivatives were also made. Compounds in which the base moiety was substituted by 5-chloro- (25), 5-(2-bromovinyl)- (32), or 5-bromo-6-methyl- (37) groups possess significant activity against duck-HBV, wild-type human HBV (2.2.15 cells), and lamivudine-resistant HBV containing single and double mutations. No cytotoxicity was seen in host HepG2 and Vero cells, up to the highest concentration tested. The anti-HBV activity exhibited by compounds 25, 32, and 37 was superior for human HBV and comparable for DHBV to that of the corresponding purine nucleoside, ganciclovir. Further, they were only 10-15-fold less inhibitory against human HBV in 2.2.15 cells than the reference drug, lamivudine. Other compounds in the series were moderately inhibitory against DHBV and wild-type human HBV. The size of the halogen and the electronegativity of the substituents at the 5- and 6-positions are important for antiviral activity toward HBV. These compounds were also evaluated for their antiviral activity for West Nile virus, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus. They were generally inactive in these antiviral assay systems (at concentrations up to 100 microg/mL). 1-[(2-Hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethoxy)methyl]-5-fluorocytosine (34) showed some inhibitory activity against hepatitis C virus. Taken together, these data support our previous observations that the 5-substituted pyrimidine nucleosides containing acyclic glycosyl moieties have potential to serve as a new generation of potent, selective, and nontoxic anti-HBV agents for wild-type and lamivudine-resistant mutant HBV.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are pollutants detected in animal tissues and breast milk. The experiments described in the present paper were aimed at evaluating whether the four PCB congeners most abundant in animal tissues (PCB-138, -153, -180 and -126), administered since fetal life till weaning, can induce long-term alterations of GH-axis activity and bone mass in the adult rat. We measured PCB accumulation in rat brain and liver, somatic growth, pituitary GH expression and plasma hormone concentrations at different ages. Finally, we studied hypothalamic somatostatin expression and bone structure in adulthood, following long-term PCB exposure. Dams were treated during pregnancy from GD15 to GD19 and during breast-feeding. A constant reduction of the growth rate in both male and female offspring from weaning to adulthood was observed in exposed animals. Long-lasting alterations on hypothalamic-pituitary GH axis were indeed observed in PCB-exposed rats in adulthood: increased somatostatin expression in hypothalamic periventricular nucleus (both males and females) and lateral arcuate nucleus (males, only) and decreased GH mRNA levels in the pituitary of male rats. Plasma IGF-1 levels were higher in PCB-exposed male and female animals as compared with controls at weaning and tended to be higher at PN60. Plasma testosterone and thyroid hormone concentrations were not significantly affected by exposure to PCBs. In adulthood, PCBs caused a significant reduction of bone mineral content and cortical bone thickness of tibiae in male rat joint to increased width of the epiphyseal cartilage disk. In conclusion, the developmental exposure to the four selected PCB compounds used in the present study induced far-reaching effects in the adult offspring, the male rats appearing more sensitive than females.
The mechanism of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrosis has not yet been well defined. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of active oxygen scavengers on the PAN-induced injury of cultured rat glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) and the generation of active oxygen species in PAN-treated GECs. When exposed to PAN (greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml), cellular damage occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner as evaluated by both the LDH release and MTT colorimetric assays. Concomitant addition of either the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger, catalase, or the iron chelating agent, deferoxamine, to the culture medium caused a striking reduction of cellular injury. This suggested a role for H2O2 and for hydroxyl radicals (OH.) generated via the iron-catalyzed breakdown of H2O2 in PAN nephrosis. Using the scopoletin fluorescence assay, the release of H2O2 into the culture medium by GECs exposed to PAN (greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml) was shown to increase dose-dependently (greater than or equal to 57 +/- 11 pmol/4.4 x 10(6) cells per h, P less than 0.01) as compared with control cells (14 +/- 2 pmol/4.4 x 10(6) cells per h). These results strongly suggested that active oxygen species, especially H2O2 and OH., might play an important role in PAN-induced GEC injury in vitro as well as in vivo.
This paper describes the psychomotor and mnesic effects of single oral doses of etifoxine (50 and 100 mg) and lorazepam (2 mg) in healthy subjects. Forty-eight healthy subjects were included in this randomized double blind, placebo controlled parallel group study [corrected]. The effects of drugs were assessed by using a battery of subjective and objective tests that explored mood and vigilance (Visual Analog Scale), attention (Barrage test), psychomotor performance (Choice Reaction Time) and memory (digit span, immediate and delayed free recall of a word list). Whereas vigilance, psychomotor performance and free recall were significantly impaired by lorazepam, neither dosage of etifoxine (50 and 100 mg) produced such effects. These results suggest that 50 and 100 mg single dose of etifoxine do not induce amnesia and sedation as compared to lorazepam.
A striking difference between two structurally related anti-estrogen medicines is that tamoxifen is strongly hepatocarcinogenic in the rat, whereas toremifene lacks such activity. To study the basis for this difference, the initiating potential of tamoxifen and toremifene were studied by measurement of rapid induction of hepatocellular altered foci (HAF) that express placental-type glutathione S-transferase in the livers of female Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats and female Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Both agents were administered by gavage at equimolar doses up to a dose that produced marked weight gain suppression. In rats given the high dose of 40 mg/kg per day tamoxifen continuously for 36 weeks, 75% of S-D rats developed liver neoplasms, in contrast to only 10% of F344 rats. In the S-D strain, tamoxifen produced a tendency to increased HAF at 2 weeks at the dose of 40 mg/kg per day and by 12 weeks, a dose-related increase was evident. In contrast, toremifene induced no HAF even at the equimolar high dose of 42.4 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks. The induction of HAF by tamoxifen was less in the F344 rats. Neither agent elicited increases in hepatocellular proliferation in S-D or F344 rats. When phenobarbital was administered for 24 weeks as a promoting agent after the anti-estrogens, S-D rats given tamoxifen at 20 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks, developed liver neoplasms, but not F344 rats or rats of either strain given even a higher dose (42.4 mg/kg) of toremifene. Thus, tamoxifen has initiating activity in these rat strains whereas toremifene does not.
The authors report a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome who developed acute hypertension, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, and reversible cerebral arterial vasoconstriction shortly after initiating intravenous immune globulin therapy. Possible interrelationships and mechanisms of these complications are discussed.
This study assessed the effectiveness of oral doxepin rinse for mucositis-related pain management in patients following 1 week of repeated dosing. Patients with oral mucositis due to head and neck radiation therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) were recruited to participate in a 1-week follow-up study. Subjects who gave informed consent rinsed with doxepin (5 ml) during the initial visit and were then told to use doxepin rinse over the next week as needed, three to six times per day, and return for a follow-up visit. At each visit, mucositis was scored using the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale and oral pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale before and after rinsing. The use of a systemic analgesic was recorded, and side effects were documented. At the follow-up visit, subjects were also asked to retrospectively report average pain scores they experienced over the past week, 5 and 15 minutes following rinse. Nine subjects were enrolled in the study. Statistically significant reductions in pain scores were reported for 2 hours following doxepin rinse during the initial visit (p < .05). Patients recalled that their pain significantly dropped within 5 minutes of rinsing over the week of repeated dosing (p < .05). At the follow-up visit, subjects reported statistically significant pain reduction 5 minutes after doxepin rinsing (p < .05). These results indicate that doxepin rinsing continues to produce reduced intensity of pain levels over a 1-week span of repeated dosing.
Administration of benzene (i.p. 1.0 mL/kg body weight) for 3 consecutive days produced leucopenia and lymphocytopenia in female albino rats. In addition, the total iron content, lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase activity of the liver and bone marrow were significantly (P < 0.001) increased. Low molecular weight (LMW) bleomycin-detectable iron accumulated only in bone marrow. Prior administration of Protein A (PA), a multipotent immunostimulant and interferon inducer (60 micrograms/kg body weight, i.v. twice weekly for 2 weeks), ameliorated most of the adverse effects of benzene. PA restored the changes in hepatic histological architecture, reversed leucopenia and superoxide dismutase activity, lipid peroxidation, total iron content and LMW iron content of bone marrow were normalized. Isozymes of glutathione-S-transferase (alpha, pi, mu) which decreased following benzene exposure increased in PA pretreated benzene exposed rats. This study suggests that pretreatment with PA modulates the toxicity of benzene.
Previous studies from this and another laboratory demonstrated that in utero ethanol exposure reduces 5-HT neurons and S100B-immunopositive glia that are proximal to these neurons. Our laboratory also found that these effects are prevented by maternal treatment with a 5-HT(1A) agonist. Because of S100B's important role in the development of 5-HT neurons, the present study used both in vivo and in vitro models to investigate the potential involvement of S100B with the damaging effects of ethanol and with the protective effects of 5-HT(1A) agonists. We used in situ hybridization to address whether a 5-HT(1A) agonist could potentially affect S100B mRNA in vivo. Maternal treatment with buspirone between gestation days 13 and 20 significantly increased S100B mRNA in neuroepithelium of G20 offspring of control (40%) and ethanol-fed dams (20%). However, S100B mRNA was not altered in neuroepithelium from ethanol-exposed offspring. In astroglial cultures, we examined whether ethanol reduces the release of S100B and whether a 5-HT(1A) agonist could stimulate the release of this protein. We also evaluated the effects of ethanol and ipsapirone on astroglial content of S100B. Neither the concentration of S100B in astroglial media nor astroglial content of S100B were affected by ethanol. However, treatment with 100 nM ipsapirone, a 5-HT(1A) agonist, between the 6th and 7th day in vitro, increased astroglial release of S100B 2- to 3-fold. Thus, the protective effects of a 5-HT(1A) agonist on ethanol-treated 5-HT neurons might be associated with the ability of these drugs to release the neurotrophic factor S100B from astrocytes.
To date, only one case of asterixis associated with the use of gabapentin (GBT) has been reported. No data, instead, are available on the occurrence of asterixis related to a dementing encephalopathy during GBT therapy in the elderly.
Case reports of two elderly patients, one with asterixis, the other with asterixis and encephalopathy, associated with the use of GBT, as adjunctive therapy, at dosages of 900 to 3600 mg/day are given. In one patient, GBT was added to oxcarbazepine (OXCBZ).
Both patients experienced resolution of the clinically apparent asterixis, and of the toxic encephalopathy, on discontinuation or reduction of GBT dosages. One patient developed asterixis after drug rechallenge. In the patient on OXCBZ, the analysis of the electromyogram (EMG) activity showed the occurrence of a subclinical asterixis.
Our study indicates that high doses of GBT may induce asterixis related to a reversible encephalopathy. Low doses of GBT, instead, may induce a disabling asterixis when given in combination with OXCBZ because of a synergistic interaction between these drugs.
In an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication, we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications. A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0.2 ml. of a combination of 3 drugs: 6 mg. papaverine, 100 micrograms. phentolamine and 10 micrograms. prostaglandin E1 with (pH 7.05) or without (pH 4.17) the addition of sodium bicarbonate (0.03 mEq.). Of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 (58%) complained of penile pain due to the medication, while only 1 of the 19 men (5%) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain. From these data we conclude that the penile pain following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication, which can be overcome by elevating the pH to a neutral level.
The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypoplasia in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is still poorly understood. During fetal lung development, the insulin receptor (IR) plays an important role by mediating the cellular uptake of glucose, which is a major substrate for the biosynthesis of surfactant phospholipids. In fetal rat lung, IR gene expression has been revealed on type II pneumocytes. Recent studies have demonstrated that downregulation of pulmonary IR in late gestation causes pulmonary hypoplasia by inhibition of surfactant synthesis. We hypothesized that pulmonary gene expression of IR is downregulated during the late stages of lung development in the nitrofen-induced CDH model.
Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either olive oil or nitrofen on day 9 of gestation (D9). Cesarean deliveries were performed on D15, D18, and D21. Fetal lungs were divided into 3 groups: control, nitrofen without CDH (CDH[-]), and nitrofen with CDH (CDH[+]) (n = 8 at each time-point, respectively). Relative messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of IR were determined by using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate protein expression of IR.
Relative expression levels of IR mRNA on D21 were significantly decreased in CDH(-) and CDH(+) group (3.99 +/- 1.50 and 5.14 +/- 0.99, respectively) compared to control (7.45 +/- 3.95; P < .05). Immunohistochemistry showed decreased IR expression in the proximal alveolar epithelium on D21 in hypoplastic lungs compared to control lungs.
Downregulation of IR gene and protein expression in hypoplastic lung during late stages of lung development may interfere with normal surfactant synthesis, causing pulmonary hypoplasia in the nitrofen-induced CDH model.
Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a highly profibrogenic molecule implicated in hepatic fibrogenesis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is an effective tool to silence gene expression post-transcriptionally. Therefore, we conducted an investigation to determine if intraportal vein siRNA injection targeting CTGF inhibits CTGF expression on rat liver in vivo and furthermore whether it protects the liver from liver fibrosis.
Some rats received carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) by subcutaneous injections every three days for six consecutive weeks, and meantime they also obtained either siRNA (0.1 mg/kg) targeting CTGF, saline or a control siRNA by intraportal vein injection to rats' liver at the same pattern. Other rats received CCl4 by subcutaneous injection for 2 weeks, followed by CCl4 and CTGF siRNA intraportal vein injection for four more weeks.
Intraportal vein injection of CTGF siRNA specifically reduced the expression of CTGF protein in rat liver, and these effects were maintained for 3 days. Six weeks after CCl4 injection, prominent upregulations were observed in the gene expressions of CTGF, type I, III collagen, laminin, tissue inhibitor metal proteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in saline or control siRNA-treated rats livers. Administrating CTGF siRNA for 4 or 6 weeks, by contrast, markedly attenuated the induction of CTGF, type I, III collagen, laminin, TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 genes, whereas Smad2, 7 gene expression was not affected. The number of active hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) determined by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin was also significantly decreased. The CTGF siRNA treatment markedly reduced serum procollagen type III, hepatic hydroxyproline and liver fibrosis staging.
Silencing CTGF expression with siRNA demonstrates therapeutic potential to prevent liver fibrosis by inhibiting HSC activation with consequent extracellular matrix accumulation and the upregulation of TGF-beta1 gene expression.
Lithium is widely used in the management of patients with affective and other behavioral disorders. In addition to its therapeutic role, it is important to recognize that it occasionally causes severe side effects. Associated with its long-term use, parathyroid hypersecretion and hypercalcemia is a rare but reported side effect. A 54-year-old patient is reported who previously had a good response to lithium carbonate treatment of his bipolar disorder. Suddenly, and after 15 years of lithium carbonate use, he presented food and water aversion, hypercalcemia, lithium intoxication (SLi of 4.30 mmol/l) and acute renal insufficiency. Haemodialysis was carried out and the patient improved dramatically.
Acute mental confusion occurred in a patient on a stable dose of amantadine after he was started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Discontinuation of the drugs led to rapid improvement. Studies in a rat model of organic cation secretion demonstrate that both amantadine and trimethoprim, but not sulfamethoxazole, inhibit the renal secretion of the organic cation procainamide. This case may represent an amantadine-trimethoprim interaction.
A 63-year-old woman had severe, symptomatic cerebral vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage. We initiated simultaneous infusions of papaverine into her left vertebral and left internal carotid arteries. Twenty-five minutes after the infusions had begun, the patient had a transient reaction of respiratory arrest followed by rapid, progressive loss of brain stem function.
