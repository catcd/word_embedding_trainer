We report the case of a patient in whom amitriptyline administration for 5 wk was followed by prolonged cholestasis. Jaundice and pruritus lasted 19 and 20 mo, respectively. Three liver biopsies were performed at different stages of the disease showing the course of liver lesions. Cholestasis initially located in the region of the hepatic venule came to be associated with the progressive development of portal tract lesions consisting of inflammatory infiltration, fibrosis, and disappearance of interlobular bile ducts. Amitriptyline hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation are deficient in subjects with the poor metabolizer phenotype of debrisoquine. Drug oxidation phenotyping with dextromethorphan showed that this patient had the extensive metabolizer phenotype. This observation demonstrates that amitriptyline can induce prolonged cholestasis and suggests that the susceptibility to develop liver injury while taking this drug may not be related to a genetic deficiency of its hydroxylation.
The effect of fumagillin (a methionine aminopeptidase-type 2 (Met-AP2) inhibitor, with antiangiogenic properties) was investigated in murine models of diet-induced obesity. Eleven-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice (group 1) were given fumagillin by oral gavage at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day during 4 weeks while fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (20.1 kJ/g), and control mice (group 2) received solvent and were pair-fed. At the end of the experiment, body weights in group 1 were significantly lower as compared to group 2 (P < 0.0005). The subcutaneous (SC) and gonadal (GON) fat mass was also significantly lower in group 1 (P < 0.005 and P < 0.05, respectively). Adipocytes were smaller in adipose tissues of mice in group 1, associated with higher adipocyte density. Blood vessel density normalized to adipocyte density was lower in group 1 adipose tissues. However, in mice with established obesity monitored to maintain the same body weight and fat mass as controls, short-term fumagillin administration was also associated with adipocyte hypotrophy (P = 0.01) without affecting blood vessel size or density. Thus, treatment with fumagillin impaired diet-induced obesity in mice, associated with adipocyte hypotrophy but without marked effect on adipose tissue angiogenesis.
Warfarin embryopathy is a well-defined manifestation of intrauterine warfarin exposure. The embryopathy phenotype as it relates to the nervous system is broad and poorly recognised. We describe an adult with neurological sequelae of fetal warfarin exposure. We review previous cases with neurological sequelae and discuss the pathogenetic mechanism in light of recent research.
  Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor ligand (GITRL) plays pro-inflammatory roles in immune response. Thus, our aim was to assess if dexamethasone attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury by affecting GITRL in Kupffer cells (KC).
  A BALB/c mouse model of liver injury was established by i.p. injecting with LPS (10 mg/kg) co-treated with or without dexamethasone (3 mg/kg). Blood and liver samples were obtained for analysis of liver morphology, GITRL expression, hepatocellular function and cytokine levels at 24 h after injection. KC were isolated and challenged by LPS (1 µg/mL), with or without dexamethasone (10 µM) co-treatment, or with GITRL siRNA pre-transfection. The GITRL expression and cytokine levels were assayed at 24 h after challenge.
  Dexamethasone treatment significantly improved the survival rate of endotoxemic mice (P < 0.05), whereas serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and γ-interferon levels were significantly decreased (P < 0.05, respectively). Concurrently, LPS-induced hepatic tissue injury was attenuated as indicated by morphological analysis; and expression of GITRL in liver tissue and KC was downregulated (P < 0.05). Consistent with these in vivo experiments, inhibited expression of GITRL, TNF-α and IL-6 caused by dexamethasone treatment were also observed in LPS-stimulated KC. The GITRL, TNF-α and IL-6 expression was also significantly inhibited by GITRL gene silencing.
  The TNF-α and IL-6 expression of LPS-stimulated KC was inhibited by GITRL gene silencing. Dexamethasone attenuates LPS-induced liver injury, at least proportionately, by downregulating GITRL in KC.
Methoxychlor is widely used as a pesticide in many countries and has been shown to induce reproductive abnormalities in male rats, causing reduced fertility. The mechanism of action of methoxychlor on the male reproductive system is not clear. In the present study we investigated whether administration of methoxychlor induces oxidative stress in the epididymis and epididymal sperm of adult rats. Methoxychlor (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg body weight/day) was administered orally for 1, 4, or 7 days. The animals were killed using anesthetic ether 24 h after of the last treatment. Epididymal sperm were collected by cutting the epididymis into small pieces in Ham's F-12 medium at 35 degrees C. The body weight and weights of the testis, liver, and kidney did not show any significant changes in the methoxychlor-treated rats. The weight of the epididymis, seminal vesicles, and ventral prostate as well as epididymal sperm counts decreased after 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day for 7 days but remained unchanged after shorter courses of treatment. Epididymal sperm motility was decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the animals treated with methoxychlor for 4 or 7 days. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase were decreased while the levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation were increased in the epididymal sperm as well as in the caput, corpus, and cauda epididymis after 4 or 7 days of treatment. The activities of superoxide dismutase decreased while the levels of lipid peroxidation increased in the liver but not in the kidney in all groups. Co-administration of the antioxidant vitamin E (20 mg/kg body weight/ day) to the 200 mg/kg/d methoxychlor-treated rats for 7 days prevented significant changes in the antioxidant systems in the epididymis and epididymal sperm and prevented alterations in sperm counts and motility. The results indicated that methoxychlor induces oxidative stress in the epididymis and epididymal sperm by decreasing antioxidant enzymes, possibly by inducing reactive oxygen species. In conclusion the adverse effect of methoxychlor on the male reproduction could be due to induction of oxidative stress.
Acetaminophen is considered as a safe analgesic and antipyretic drug in paediatric age. The main problem in the use of acetaminophen is acute liver failure after an overdose or an acute intoxication. We report a case of fulminant liver failure and spontaneous recovery in a patient treated with a prolonged course of acetaminophen at recommended dosages.
To investigate changes in urinary PGE(2) after ibuprofen treatment in preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
Twenty preterm infants with a hemodynamically significant PDA (gestational age, 28.6 +/- 2.3 weeks) and 20 controls (gestational age, 30.4 +/- 1.5 weeks) were prospectively enrolled at 48-72 h of life. After enrollment, the former underwent conventional ibuprofen-lysine treatment. At 48-72 h (T(0)) and 108-144 h of life (T(1)), urine samples were noninvasively collected in both groups to measure urinary PGE(2) concentrations (enzyme immunoassay method), and renal function was investigated.
Urinary PGE(2) decreased significantly both in ibuprofen-treated patients (66.95 +/- 16.78 vs. 27.15 +/- 17.92 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and in controls (71.7 +/- 16.2 vs. 53.2 +/- 18.4 pg/mL, P < 0.001) from T(0) to T(1). However, urinary PGE(2) at T(1) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the ibuprofen group compared to the control group. Acute renal failure occurred in three ibuprofen-treated patients (15%).
Ibuprofen markedly reduces (59.4%) urinary PGE(2) and may alter renal function in the newborn.
Thromboembolic disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries. Our previous study found that Chinese subjects carried the same polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene as described in Western studies. The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of MTHFR polymorphism, B vitamins and other factors on plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels and risk of thromboembolic disease in Chinese.
One hundred and six subjects were enrolled into the study. They were categorized into 4 groups: healthy individuals (n = 42); those with diabetes mellitus (n = 20); those with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (n = 11); and those with coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 33). Plasma levels of folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12, Hcy, and fasting blood sugar were measured; total cholesterol, triglycerides, complete blood count, and 677 C-->T mutation in MTHFR were determined.
Plasma Hcy was lowest in the healthy subjects, higher in diabetics, followed by patients with DVT, and highest in patients with CAD (p < 0.001, ANOVA). MTHFR C677T polymorphism was the common factor affecting plasma logHcy levels in all 4 groups of subjects. Triglycerides affected plasma logHcy in the CAD patients. For the 4 groups as a whole, MTHFR polymorphism, triglycerides, and vitamin B12 were the most significant factors influencing plasma Hcy.
We suggest that high plasma Hcy is an important risk factor for CAD. Other factors including MTHFR polymorphism, vitamin B12, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and gender might affect Hcy levels in different diseases and conditions.
To systematically investigate the relationships between thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) polymorphisms and azathioprine-related adverse drug reactions in patients with kidney transplantation.
Erythrocyte TPMT activity of 150 patients with kidney transplantation and AZA therapy was determined by HPLC. The frequency of four common TPMT mutant alleles, TPMT*2, *3A, *3B, and *3C was determined by allele-specific PCR and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.
Thirty cases (20%) had stopped azathioprine medication or were on reduced dose due to azathioprine-related side effects. The TPMT activity range of cases who never experienced side effects was 16.63-68.25 U, the mean of the controls was 38.43 +/- 11.59 U. The mean value of 12 cases with hematotoxicity was 23.50 +/- 10.33 U, much lower than the control mean (P < 0.05). No significant difference between the mean value of 18 cases with hepatotoxicity and the control mean (P > 0.05) was seen. No case with TPMT deficiency was found in all patients studied, and TPMT*2, *3A, and *3B were not detected in any of them. TPMT*3C heterozygous alleles were found in 4.7% (seven cases) of these patients, all seven cases had intermediate TPMT activity, and the mean was 16.75 +/- 2.09 U, much lower than other TPMT wild-type patients (P < 0.05). In the seven TPMT*3C patients, four cases experienced side effects (hematotoxicity, n = 2; hepatotoxicity, n = 2).
This study demonstrates that TPMT activity is reduced in patients with TPMT*3C mutation. AZA-induced hematotoxicity is related to the reduced TPMT activity.
Acute abstinence symptomatology following multiple deliveries of smoked cocaine was examined. Twelve crack cocaine users (male and female) participated in an inpatient study. Participants smoked 7 deliveries of cocaine on each of 4 experimental days, with each participant being exposed twice to 2 dose sizes of cocaine (0.40 vs. 0.07 mg/kg "placebo"). Symptoms of cocaine abstinence were measured for 6 hr following cocaine administration and again the following morning. Participants reported feeling increased craving, anxiety, and uncertainty 30 min after the 7th delivery of 0.40 mg/kg cocaine, when cocaine plasma levels were still on the descending curve. It is not clear whether these were true abstinence effects or were due to residual effects of cocaine. No significant differences were found at subsequent abstinence-assessment points. These data indicate that acute abstinence effects from smoked cocaine in a laboratory setting may be minimal.
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most prevalent pregnancy-specific liver disease and is associated with an increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes, including preterm labor and intrauterine death. The endocrine signals that cause cholestasis are not known but 3α-sulfated progesterone metabolites have been shown to be elevated in ICP, leading us to study the impact of sulfated progesterone metabolites on farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated bile acid homeostasis pathways. Here we report that the 3β-sulfated progesterone metabolite epiallopregnanolone sulfate is supraphysiologically raised in the serum of ICP patients. Mice challenged with cholic acid developed hypercholanemia and a hepatic gene expression profile indicative of FXR activation. However, coadministration of epiallopregnanolone sulfate with cholic acid exacerbated the hypercholanemia and resulted in aberrant gene expression profiles for hepatic bile acid-responsive genes consistent with cholestasis. We demonstrate that levels of epiallopregnanolone sulfate found in ICP can function as a partial agonist for FXR, resulting in the aberrant expression of bile acid homeostasis genes in hepatoma cell lines and primary human hepatocytes. Furthermore, epiallopregnanolone sulfate inhibition of FXR results in reduced FXR-mediated bile acid efflux and secreted FGF19. Using cofactor recruitment assays, we show that epiallopregnanolone sulfate competitively inhibits bile acid-mediated recruitment of cofactor motifs to the FXR-ligand binding domain.
Our results reveal a novel molecular interaction between ICP-associated levels of the 3β-sulfated progesterone metabolite epiallopregnanolone sulfate and FXR that couples the endocrine component of pregnancy in ICP to abnormal bile acid homeostasis.
Two brothers with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and multiple arterial and venous thromboembolism affecting peripheral vessels are described. Heparin-dependent antiplatelet antibody was detected using platelet aggregometry in both patients. Although these observations may be coincidental, the possibility of familial occurrence of this adverse reaction to heparin cannot be excluded with certainty.
A case of methylphenidate-induced mania is described in a 10-year-old boy with severe hyperactivity and a positive family history for bipolar illness. Similarities between symptoms manifested in this patient and developmental disturbances observed in young offspring of affectively ill parents are discussed. Although the predictive relationship between early childhood psychopathology and later emergence of manic-depressive illness remains unknown, caution is suggested when using psychostimulant medications in children with familial affective disorders.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists have been widely used as effective agents in endocrine therapy for prostate cancer. Continuous administration of the drug results in profound suppression of testicular androgen production. However, the side effects on erectile function have not been fully investigated.
We studied the influences of testosterone suppression on male sexual function and nocturnal penile tumescence in nine sexually active patients with prostate cancer who were treated with an LHRH agonist.
Following reduction of serum testosterone concentrations to a castration level by the administration of the LHRH agonist, sexual desire, sexual interest and sexual intercourse were totally annulled, with significant changes in frequency, magnitude, duration and rigidity of nocturnal erections observed in all patients.
These results demonstrate that the LHRH agonist strongly suppresses erectile function and sexual activity. Taking into account the quality of sexual function for relatively young and sexually active patients and their partners, it is necessary to establish effective modalities that minimize the adverse effects on sexual function for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer.
Minocycline, a semisynthetic second-generation tetracycline, was reported to have neuroprotective effects in models of global and focal cerebral ischemia, the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington disease, as well as glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in mixed neuronal/glial cultures. It was suggested that neuroprotective effects of minocycline resulted from inhibition of microglial/astroglial activation 'Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 1998 15769'. To determine whether or not minocycline is able to directly protect neurons against injury insults and to delineate its neuroprotective mechanism(s), we treated cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) with nitric oxide (NO) in the presence or absence of minocycline. We found that minocycline protected neurons against NO-induced neuronal death in a concentration-dependent fashion. Consistent to other reports, NO was able to induce p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation at 3-6 h and such an induction could be significantly inhibited by minocycline. Furthermore, SB 203580, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, almost completely attenuated NO-induced neuronal death of CGN as well. These results suggest that minocycline is able to block NO-induced neurotoxicity in CGN by inhibiting NO-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. Our finding may explain the neuroprotective mechanism of minocycline in those neurodegenerative models.
The toxicological effects of realgar after intragastrical administration (1 g/kg body weight) were investigated over a 21 day period in male Wistar rats using metabonomic analysis of (1)H NMR spectra of urine, serum and liver tissue aqueous extracts. Liver and kidney histopathology examination and serum clinical chemistry analyses were also performed. (1)H NMR spectra and pattern recognition analyses from realgar treated animals showed increased excretion of urinary Kreb's cycle intermediates, increased levels of ketone bodies in urine and serum, and decreased levels of hepatic glucose and glycogen, as well as hypoglycemia and hyperlipoidemia, suggesting the perturbation of energy metabolism. Elevated levels of choline containing metabolites and betaine in serum and liver tissue aqueous extracts and increased serum creatine indicated altered transmethylation. Decreased urinary levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide, phenylacetylglycine and hippurate suggested the effects on the gut microflora environment by realgar. Signs of impairment of amino acid metabolism were supported by increased hepatic glutamate levels, increased methionine and decreased alanine levels in serum, and hypertaurinuria. The observed increase in glutathione in liver tissue aqueous extracts could be a biomarker of realgar induced oxidative injury. Serum clinical chemistry analyses showed increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase as well as increased levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, indicating slight liver and kidney injury. The time-dependent biochemical variations induced by realgar were achieved using pattern recognition methods. This work illustrated the high reliability of NMR-based metabonomic approach on the study of the biochemical effects induced by traditional Chinese medicine.
Although melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is believed to be an important regulator of feeding behavior, both its acute and chronic effects on food intake as well as its interaction with other brain peptides involved in the control of appetite remain unclear. Therefore, the acute effects of MCH on food intake and the chronic effect of MCH on food intake and the gene expression of various hypothalamic peptides involved in the control of appetite were studied in rats.
Either the acute or the continuous intraventricular infusion of MCH for 12 days stimulated feeding in both Wistar or Sprague-Dawley rats. Removal of the hypothalamus at the end of the chronic infusion studies allowed measurement of the expression of mRNAs encoding for MCH, neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin, agouti gene-related peptide, cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript and neurotensin-neuropeptides involved in the control of appetite. Chronic intraventricular infusion of MCH activated only NPY mRNA synthesis in Sprague-Dawley rats. The increase in food intake in response to MCH in Sprague-Dawley rats did not appear to be due to the release of NPY since combination studies demonstrated consistently additive effects of the two peptides on food intake at maximum or near maximum doses.
These results strongly suggest that MCH is an orexigenic peptide involved in the control of both short- and long term food intake in satiated rats and further indicate that the MCH pathway is a possible target for the control of food intake and obesity.
The aim of the article was to study efficacy and safety of nifedipine in the correction of extrapyramidal side-effects emerged during conventional neuroleptics therapy. Fifty-one patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia received haloperidol in combination with nifedipine (25 patients) or haloperidol only (26 patients) during 26 weeks. Dynamics of psychopathological symptoms and extrapyramidal disorders were measured with PANSS, CGI, BARS, SARS and AIMS. Patients receiving haloperidol in combination with nifedipine had the lower AIMS scores indicating appearances of dyskinesia and less marked (on the trend to statistical significance) SARS scores measuring parkinsonian symptoms as compared to patients receiving monotherapy with haloperidol. The administration of nifedipine in combination with haloperidol did not reduce the therapeutic efficacy of the latter and did not lead to the increase of side-effects. The data obtained suggest that nifedipine may be used as a perspective corrector of extrapyramidal disorders caused by classical neuroleptics.
How frequently should urine samples be collected and analyzed to accurately measure drug use in clinical trials of cocaine abuse treatments? Previous research suggests that analyzing one of three weekly urine toxicology samples in an opiate-related trial may be sufficient. To empirically address this question in the field of cocaine research, we examined the weekly variation in the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine (BE) concentration between pairs of weekly urine samples from a clinical trial of a treatment for cocaine dependence. Twice weekly urine samples from 71 subjects collected over eleven weeks were assayed for quantitative BE levels. Agreement between pairs of samples was estimated for both quantitative and qualitative measures of BE. Results indicated substantial intra-week variation with correlations never exceeding .50 and approximately 20% disagreement among samples using cutoff values in place of quantitative levels. Both samples, however, supported similar conclusions about group-level behavior.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is known to have cardiac manifestations consisting of pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, and coronary vasculitis. Pericarditis is the most common cardiac manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Myocarditis may be suspected in patients presenting with unexplained tachycardia, conduction disturbances, unexplained systolic dysfunction with or without heart failure, or arrhythmias. The development of arrhythmias in systemic lupus erythematosus could be secondary to pericarditis, myocarditis, or ischemia caused by coronary vasculitis. The development of atrial fibrillation in systemic lupus erythematosus is not commonly reported. There have been few reports on the patients developing atrial fibrillation after being started on methylprednisolone therapy. Described here is a case of the development of atrial fibrillation in a newly diagnosed 37-year-old patient with systemic lupus erythematosus who was started on intravenous methylprednisolone therapy.
Sublingual nifedipine, 30 mg, was used to abolish hypertensive crises in 32 patients. A follow-up of changes in blood pressure, ECG, and echocardiographic parameters evaluating the cardiac performance and central hemodynamics was performed during 4 hours after the drug. The patients with profound myocardial hypertrophy and dilatation at a left ventricular myocardial weight of over 200 g at the peak of the antihypertensive effect occurred for 15-60 min exhibited transient ECG changes by the type of subendocardial ischemia despite an above 25% reduction in mean blood pressure and the lack of severe reflex tachycardia, the pump function of the heart showing no decreases. The ejection fraction increased from 51.0 +/- 2.8 to 62.0 +/- 2.5% (p less than 0.05) due to lower afterload. There were no clinical manifestations typical of myocardial ischemia.
The half-life (t1/2) of cocaine is relatively short, but some of the consequences of its use, such as seizures and strokes, can occur hours after exposure. This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae. We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BE), to cause seizures. Two separate equimolar doses (0.2 and 0.4 mumol) of either cocaine or BE were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats. Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence, latency, and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures. BE-Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine. Whereas cocaine-induced seizures were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in death, those induced by BE were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in death. Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression. BE-Injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine-injected animals without seizures. The finding that cocaine- and BE-induced seizures differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for cocaine-induced seizures and emphasizes the importance of a cocaine metabolite, BE.
Administration of fenoldopam mesylate (FM), a dopaminergic agonist, or of cyclic cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE III), for example theophylline and caffeine, induces arteritis in the rat. In this study we characterized the arteritis induced by UK-61,260, an investigational inotropic agent with vasodilatory properties which displays an inhibitory action on cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, in comparison with lesions induced by FM. The compounds were administered to Sprague-Dawley rats by intravenous infusion over 24 h (FM and UK-61,260), orally or subcutaneously (UK-61,260); the rats were killed and necropsied for pathological examination at various times between 0 h and 28 days post-infusion. Infusion of UK-61,260 at doses of 100, 300 or 400 mg/kg produced arteritis mainly in the mesenteric arteries and occasionally in the renal, pancreatic, gastric and coronary arteries. There were no arterial lesions after infusion of 30 mg/kg, or after administration of 30, 100 or 200 mg/kg per day subcutaneously for 7 days, or after acute administration of 100, 300, 400 or 600 mg/kg orally. Infusion of rats with 72 or 144 mg/kg FM produced arteritis over a wider range of tissues than did UK-61,260. However, the arterial lesions produced by infusion of either drug have the same initial aspect and a similar evolution with time. Immediately after the end of the infusion, minimal necrosis and haemorrhage occurred in the media only, without involvement of the endothelium or the perivascular space. This indicates that the media of the artery is the primary site of injury. The lesions seen 1 and 3 days post-infusion were characterized by severe medial necrosis and haemorrhage with perivascular acute inflammation and appeared macroscopically as haemorrhagic spots on the vessels. On days 7, 14 and 28 post-infusion, no medial necrosis or haemorrhage were present, while perivascular chronic inflammation and moderate smooth muscle hyperplasia were seen. It appeared, therefore, that the lesions underwent repair in 28 days, but footprints of the damage were still present 28 days post-infusion. The similarity between arteritis induced in rats by fenoldopam or by UK-61,260, at doses inducing PDE III inhibition, is consistent with the view that they have a similar pathogenesis. In our view it is probable that these pharmacologically and chemically distinct drugs trigger an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP which in turn triggers vascular damage. The arterial changes observed in the current study after acute administration may explain the increased incidence of polyarteritis nodosa occurring in long term toxicity studies with FM or PDE III inhibitors.
There are few published studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among substance abusers seeking treatment. Eleven patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for cocaine dependence and adult ADHD were entered into a 12-week single-blind trial of divided daily doses of bupropion (BPR). All patients received weekly individual standardized relapse prevention therapy. Treatment compliance and retention were good. Patients reported significant reductions in attention difficulties, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Self-reported cocaine use, cocaine craving, and cocaine positive toxicologies, also decreased significantly. In a previously published trial, 12 patients who met similar diagnostic criteria for adult ADHD and cocaine dependence were entered into a 12-week trial of divided daily doses of sustained-release methylphenidate (MPH). Improvements observed on BPR were similar to, and did not differ from those previously observed with MPH. These preliminary data suggest that BPR may be as effective as sustained-release MPH, when combined with relapse prevention therapy, for cocaine abusers with adult ADHD. However, a future study directly comparing BPR to MPH in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial is needed.
