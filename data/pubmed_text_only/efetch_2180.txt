Gastroesophageal reflux is very common in childhood. If conservative procedures fail to relieve it, the use of a potent antiemetic agent that facilitates gastric motility and emptying, such as domperidone, is justified. We report a 4-month-old child who presented with QT interval prolongation after the oral use of domperidone, which normalized after the drug was discontinued.
The trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON), a potent ribotoxic mycotoxin produced by the cereal blight fungus Fusarium graminearum, commonly contaminates grain-based foods. Oral exposure to DON causes decreased food intake, reduced weight gain and body weight loss in experimental animals - effects that have been linked to dysregulation of hormones responsible for mediating satiety at the central nervous system level. When diet-induced obese (DIO) mice are fed DON, they consume less food, eventually achieving body weights of control diet-fed mice. Here, we extended these findings by characterizing: (1) reversibility of DON-induced body weight loss and anorexia in DIO mice and (2) the role of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) which has been previously linked to initiation of the ribotoxic stress response. The results demonstrated that DON-induced weight loss was reversible in DIO mice and this effect corresponded to initiation of a robust hyperphagic response. When DIO mice deficient in PKR were exposed to DON, they exhibited weight suppression similar to DIO wild-type fed the toxin, suggesting the toxin's weight effects were not dependent on PKR. Taken together, DON's effects on food consumption and body weight are not permanent and, furthermore, PKR is not an essential signaling molecule for DON's anorectic and weight effects.
We hereby report that repeated administration of ketamine (350 mg/kg in total) and methamphetamine (30 mg/kg in total) causes specific glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuron deficits, respectively, in adult mouse brain. Acute ketamine did not affect basal body temperature or the later methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia. However, pretreatment with repeated doses of ketamine aggravated methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic terminal loss as evidenced by a drastic decrease in the levels of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and dopamine transporter density as well as poor gait balance performance. In contrast, methamphetamine-induced serotonergic depletion was not altered by ketamine pretreatment. Likewise, the subsequent treatment with methamphetamine exacerbated the ketamine-induced glutamatergic damage as indicated by reduced levels of the vesicular glutamate transporter in hippocampus and striatum and poor memory performance in the Morris water maze. Finally, since activation of the D1 and AMPA/kainate receptors has been known to be involved in the release of glutamate and dopamine, we examined the effects of co-administration of SCH23390, a D1 antagonist, and CNQX, an AMPA/kainate antagonist. Intraventricular CNQX infusion abolished ketamine's potentiation of methamphetamine-induced dopamine neurotoxicity, while systemic SCH23390 mitigated methamphetamine's potentiation of ketamine-induced glutamatergic toxicity. We conclude that repeated doses of ketamine potentiate methamphetamine-induced dopamine neurotoxicity via AMPA/kainate activation and that conjunctive use of methamphetamine aggravates ketamine-induced glutamatergic neurotoxicity possibly via D1 receptor activation.
Many painful conditions are associated with alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of affected tissues. While several integrins, the receptors for ECM proteins, are present on sensory neurons that mediate pain, the possible role of these cell adhesion molecules in inflammatory or neuropathic pain has not been explored. We found that the intradermal injection of peptide fragments of domains of laminin and fibronectin important for adhesive signaling selectively inhibited the hyperalgesia caused by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and epinephrine (EPI), respectively. The block of EPI hyperalgesia was mimicked by other peptides containing the RGD integrin-binding sequence. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the alpha1 or alpha3 integrin subunits, which participate in laminin binding, selectively blocked PGE2 hyperalgesia, while a mAb against the alpha5 subunit, which participates in fibronectin binding, blocked only EPI-induced hyperalgesia. A mAb against the beta1 integrin subunit, common to receptors for both laminin and fibronectin, inhibited hyperalgesia caused by both agents, as did the knockdown of beta1 integrin expression by intrathecal injection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. The laminin peptide, but not the fibronectin peptides, also reversibly abolished the longer lasting inflammatory hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan. Finally, the neuropathic hyperalgesia caused by systemic administration of the cancer chemotherapy agent taxol was reversibly inhibited by antisense knockdown of beta1 integrin. These results strongly implicate specific integrins in the maintenance of inflammatory and neuropathic hyperalgesia.
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrythmogenic disease characterized by exercise--or stress--induced ventricular tachyarrythmias, syncope, or sudden death, usually in the pediatric age group. Familial occurrence has been noted in about 30% of cases. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or recessive, usually with high penetrance. The causative genes have been mapped to chromosome 1. Mutations of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) have been identified in autosomal dominant pedigrees, while calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) mutations are seen in recessive cases.
Due to its potential lethal outcome, exclusion or confirmation of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in children with physical and emotional syncope is mandatory. We report a case of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a three-year-old child only diagnosed by genetic mapping.
Dexfenfluramine increases serotonergic activity by stimulating serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) release into brain synapses, inhibiting its reuptake into presynaptic neurons and by directly stimulating postsynaptic serotonin receptors. On the basis of the serotonin hypothesis of appetite control, these actions would be expected to reduce appetite and, consequently, bodyweight. Studies conducted in animals and in overweight patients with and without associated disorders have confirmed the weight-reducing efficacy and good tolerability of dexfenfluramine. In 3-month clinical studies in obese patients, weight reductions with dexfenfluramine 15mg twice daily combined with dietary support were significantly higher than those achieved with placebo and similar to those with ephedrine/caffeine 20/20mg 3 times daily, sibutramine 10mg once daily and fluoxetine 60 mg/day. Furthermore, dexfenfluramine recipients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia or hypertension consistently show improvements in glycaemic control, blood lipid profiles and blood pressure. 12-month trial results indicate that most weight loss occurs in the initial 6 months and appears to be maintained for a further 6 months. Weight regain after withdrawal of treatment in 12-month studies demonstrates that dexfenfluramine is effective in maintaining a stable bodyweight at a lower level than placebo and in limiting food intake over this time period. Commonly reported adverse events with dexfenfluramine include diarrhoea, tiredness, dry mouth and somnolence; these symptoms are generally mild and transient. Approximately 7 and 10% of dexfenfluramine recipients in short and long term studies withdrew because of adverse events. Dexfenfluramine was better tolerated than ephedrine/caffeine and fluoxetine in short term studies. Obesity is a chronic condition that is accompanied by a number of metabolic complications. It is a significant health problem in developed countries, and as a major risk factor for many chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the economic burden of this condition is considerable. As with other chronic conditions, there is a role for pharmacological intervention in patients with severe obesity. However, drugs should be considered as only one component of a weight-control programme, since additional lifestyle modification is required to maintain weight loss. The promising data on the long term efficacy and tolerability of dexfenfluramine as well as its favourable effects on risk factors associated with obesity requires confirmation in long term studies. In the meantime, dexfenfluramine should be considered a valuable adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet in the management of severe obesity, particularly in patients with associated disorders and those unsuccessful with conventional weight loss measures. Available data support the use of the drug for up to 1 year to maintain weight loss and thus dexfenfluramine should be considered for long term administration.
Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with statin therapy results in substantial reductions in cardiovascular events, and larger reductions in cholesterol may produce larger benefits. In rare cases, myopathy occurs in association with statin therapy, especially when the statins are administered at higher doses and with certain other medications.
We carried out a genomewide association study using approximately 300,000 markers (and additional fine-mapping) in 85 subjects with definite or incipient myopathy and 90 controls, all of whom were taking 80 mg of simvastatin daily as part of a trial involving 12,000 participants. Replication was tested in a trial of 40 mg of simvastatin daily involving 20,000 participants.
The genomewide scan yielded a single strong association of myopathy with the rs4363657 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within SLCO1B1 on chromosome 12 (P=4x10(-9)). SLCO1B1 encodes the organic anion-transporting polypeptide OATP1B1, which has been shown to regulate the hepatic uptake of statins. The noncoding rs4363657 SNP was in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium with the nonsynonymous rs4149056 SNP (r(2)=0.97), which has been linked to statin metabolism. The prevalence of the rs4149056 C allele in the population was 15%. The odds ratio for myopathy was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6 to 7.7) per copy of the C allele, and 16.9 (95% CI, 4.7 to 61.1) in CC as compared with TT homozygotes. More than 60% of these myopathy cases could be attributed to the C variant. The association of rs4149056 with myopathy was replicated in the trial of 40 mg of simvastatin daily, which also showed an association between rs4149056 and the cholesterol-lowering effects of simvastatin. No SNPs in any other region were clearly associated with myopathy.
We have identified common variants in SLCO1B1 that are strongly associated with an increased risk of statin-induced myopathy. Genotyping these variants may help to achieve the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN74348595.)
Data from several studies implicate that pre-treatment with non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin or diclofenac may decrease the incidence of postoperative succinycholine-related myalgia. We tested the influence of a preoperatively administered selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, parecoxib, on postoperative myalgia.
After Ethics Committee approval, 68 patients were randomized into two groups (n = 34 each). Group 1 received parecoxib 40 mg intravenously 3 min before induction of anaesthesia, and Group 2 received saline (in a double-blinded manner). Incidence and severity of myalgia was evaluated systematically with a standardized questionnaire 24, 48 and 72 h after anaesthesia. We also the assessed the number of patients who felt limited in their activity due to myalgia.
Seven patients in the parecoxib-treated group complained of myalgia compared with 11 in the control group (not significant). No significant difference in the severity of myalgia or in the limitation of patients activity was found between the groups.
Intravenous parecoxib 40 mg, when administered before induction of anaesthesia, did not reduce incidence and severity of postoperative myalgia and did not improve activity in those who suffered from myalgia.
Many homeobox genes are clustered in a linear array along a chromosome, reflecting their ordered expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Expression patterns as well as grafting, ectopic expression and loss-of-function experiments suggest that the Hox genes encode a combinatorial system of positional specification along that axis. In contrast, the function of orphan homeobox genes located at sites outside the four mammalian Hox clusters is less well understood. To assess the functional role of the orphan homeobox gene Hox11, we have generated Hox11-deficient mice through gene targeting. Hox11-/- mice have no spleen, but otherwise appear normal. Hox11 is normally expressed in the splenic anlage arising from the splanchnic mesoderm. Hox11-/- embryos have no cellular organization at the site of splenic development but all other splanchnic derivatives develop normally. Hox11 controls the genesis of a single organ, providing new insight into the genetic regulation of morphogenesis.
We report on a case where a child was prescribed Dimotapp elixir and developed a severe adverse reaction.
The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod (FTY720) elicits a negative chronotropic effect at treatment initiation that attenuates thereafter. The authors determined whether isoproterenol can counteract this effect. In this randomized, crossover study, 14 healthy subjects received 5 infusions of isoproterenol (titrated to increase heart rate to 100-120 bpm) or intravenous placebo. The first infusion was 2 hours before and the other 4 infusions were between 3 and 6 hours after a 5-mg oral dose of fingolimod. Telemetry and pharmacokinetic data were collected for 24 hours. During isoproterenol infusion 1 (before fingolimod administration), heart rate was increased 80% from preinfusion 68 +/- 9 bpm to a maximum 122 +/- 15 bpm. Administration of fingolimod decreased heart rate from 73 +/- 11 bpm predose to a nadir of 57 +/- 8 bpm. The subsequent isoproterenol infusion 2 in the presence of fingolimod increased mean heart rate by 85% to a maximum 105 +/- 21 bpm. A 41% higher total isoproterenol dose was needed to increase heart rate to the target range with fingolimod (97 +/- 6 mcg) compared with isoproterenol alone (69 +/- 27 mcg). Isoproterenol infusions 3 to 5 had similar effects on heart rate as infusion 2. Fingolimod had no significant influence on blood pressure responses to isoproterenol. Isoproterenol did not alter the pharmacokinetics of fingolimod. The pure beta-agonist isoproterenol can reverse the heart rate reduction that occurs transiently after initiating fingolimod treatment.
We have recently reported that ligation of the CD44 cell surface antigen with A3D8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) triggers incomplete differentiation and apoptosis of the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived NB4 cells. The present study characterizes the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effect of A3D8 in NB4 cells. We show that A3D8 induces activation of both initiator caspase-8 and -9 and effector caspase-3 and -7 but only inhibition of caspase-3/7 and caspase-8 reduces A3D8-induced apoptosis. Moreover, A3D8 induces mitochondrial alterations (decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential DeltaPsi m and cytochrome c release), which are reduced by caspase-8 inhibitor, suggesting that caspase-8 is primarily involved in A3D8-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells. However, the apoptotic process is independent of TNF-family death receptor signalling. Interestingly, the general serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) decreases A3D8-induced apoptosis and when combined with general caspase inhibitor displays an additive effect resulting in complete prevention of apoptosis. These results suggest that both caspase-dependent and serine protease-dependent pathways contribute to A3D8-induced apoptosis. Finally, A3D8 induces apoptosis in all-trans-retinoic acid-resistant NB4-derived cells and in APL primary blasts, characterizing the A3D8 anti-CD44 mAb as a novel class of apoptosis-inducing agent in APL.
The lipid-modifying profile of bezafibrate is characterised by marked decreases in elevated triglyceride levels, increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and decreases in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Bezafibrate also reduces elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and fibrinogen, which are independent cardiovascular risk factors. Bezafibrate is effective in most types of primary and secondary dyslipidaemia. It is of greatest benefit in conditions featuring hypertriglyceridaemia and/or HDL cholesterol deficiency. This is particularly true for patients with diabetes mellitus, notably those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) who are also likely to have increased fibrinogen levels. In the limited comparisons available, there appear to be few consistent differences in lipid-modifying effects between bezafibrate and other fibrates. Compared with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, bezafibrate causes larger changes in triglyceride and, in general, HDL cholesterol levels, and has a lesser influence on LDL and total cholesterol levels. These differences are advantageous when bezafibrate and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are used as combined therapy in patients with severe dyslipidaemia unresponsive to either modality alone. The combination of bezafibrate plus an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in clinical trials has not led to the predicted increase in myalgia. Indeed, bezafibrate is generally free of serious unwanted effects: rhabdomyolysis is rare and has occurred mainly in patients with renal dysfunction given excessive dosages. Other patient groups in whom bezafibrate has improved serum lipid profiles are those with isolated HDL cholesterol deficiency, dyslipidaemia secondary to renal insufficiency, and following cardiac surgery or other procedures. However, data for these indications are not extensive. Evidence is now available to show a beneficial effect of bezafibrate on retarding atherosclerotic processes and in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. The 5-year Bezafibrate Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial (BECAIT) in young male survivors of myocardial infarction demonstrated a smaller decrease in luminal diameter and a reduction in coronary events with bezafibrate compared with placebo. The Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study is expected to provide mortality data which is currently lacking for bezafibrate. In conclusion, bezafibrate is a useful and well-tolerated lipid-modifying agent in the management of primary and secondary dyslipidaemia. It has particularly beneficial effects in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia and/or low HDL cholesterol levels, and reduces fibrinogen levels. Together with its ability to sustain or improve glycaemic control, these properties make it a logical choice for treating patients with diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia. Additionally, the drug may be of value as combination therapy in patients with severe dyslipidaemia. Importantly, there is evidence that the drug can slow the atherosclerotic process and reduce cardiovascular morbidity. The ongoing BIP secondary intervention study and other investigations will help clarify the effects of bezafibrate on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.
Hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA) is an autosomal dominant disease with high penetrance, manifest by brain hemorrhages in young normotensive adults. In Iceland, this condition is caused by the L68Q mutation in the cystatin C gene, with contemporary carriers reaching an average age of only 30 years. Here, we report, based both on linkage disequilibrium and genealogical evidence, that all known copies of this mutation derive from a common ancestor born roughly 18 generations ago. Intriguingly, the genealogies reveal that obligate L68Q carriers born 1825 to 1900 experienced a drastic reduction in life span, from 65 years to the present-day average. At the same time, a parent-of-origin effect emerged, whereby maternal inheritance of the mutation was associated with a 9 year reduction in life span relative to paternal inheritance. As these trends can be observed in several different extended families, many generations after the mutational event, it seems likely that some environmental factor is responsible, perhaps linked to radical changes in the life-style of Icelanders during this period. A mutation with such radically different phenotypic effects in reaction to normal variation in human life-style not only opens the possibility of preventive strategies for HCCAA, but it may also provide novel insights into the complex relationship between genotype and environment in human disease.
Acute hemodynamic effects of beraprost sodium were tested in a canine vasoconstrictive pulmonary hypertension model induced by the continuous infusion of U-46619, a thromboxane A(2)mimetic. The effects of beraprost were compared with those of prostaglandin E(1), nitroglycerin and nifedipine. Beraprost and nitroglycerin decreased pulmonary arterial pressure. On the other hand, prostaglandin E(1)and nifedipine increased pulmonary arterial pressure. All drugs except nitroglycerin increased cardiac output and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance. Beraprost was selective to pulmonary circulation, while nitroglycerin, prostaglandin E(1), and nifedipine showed poor selectivity for the pulmonary vasculature. These results suggest that the vasodilative effect of beraprost is the most selective for the pulmonary circulation among these four vasodilators.
Preclinical studies of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) against solid tumors in the human tumor cloning assay and evidence that 2-CdA is active against slow-growing or resting tumor cells have stimulated interest in the clinical activity of this agent against solid tumors. This study sought to estimate the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and plasma and urine pharmacokinetics accompanying the intravenous administration of 2-CdA by 120-h continuous infusion in patients with solid tumors. Treated patients were also assessed for other toxicities of therapy and for antitumor response. A total of 23 patients received 35 courses of treatment given at doses of 3.5, 5.3, 6.5 and 8.1 mg/m2 per day by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days and repeated every 28 days. Blood and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after drug infusion. The dose-limiting toxicity at 8.1 mg/m2 per day manifested as granulocytopenia in 2 of 5 patients (3 of 7 courses of treatment) and as thrombocytopenia in 3 of 5 patients (3 of 7 courses of treatment). At the dose levels of 6.5 and 8.1 mg/m2 per day, recovery from thrombocytopenia was often delayed. Severe lymphocytopenia (< 1,000/microliters) was observed at all dose levels of 2-CdA. Dose-related anemia and leukopenia were observed and were infrequently severe. Non-hematological toxicities were confined to mild-to-moderate nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and anorexia. Fever of 37 degrees-40 degrees C was induced during drug infusion in 19 patients. No antitumor response was observed. Average plasma concentrations at steady-state (Cpss) ranged from 3 ng/ml at the initial dose level to 13 ng/ml at the dose level of 8.1 mg/m2 per day. Both the Cpss and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were proportional to the dose. A relationship was observed between the percentage of change in absolute neutrophil count and the AUC. Renal excretion accounted for only 18% of the elimination of 2-CdA over the 5-day infusion period. The maximum tolerated dose for 2-CdA given by 5-day continuous infusion was 8.1 mg/m2 per day in this study. The recommended dose on this schedule for phase II studies is 6.5 mg/m2 per day. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were dose-limiting. No antitumor activity was observed during this study. On the basis of the plasma concentrations of 2-CdA observed, it is unlikely that this schedule of drug administration will permit achievement of the concentrations consistent with antitumor activity observed in preclinical studies.
Sleep disturbances appear as a comorbid condition in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of activity levels during sleep and therapeutic response to methylphenidate (MPH).
Nightly sleep actigraphic recordings during a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical study (1-week of 0.5 mg/kg MPH; 1-week of placebo) were obtained on 44 children, 6 to 12 years old, diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (DSM-IV).
Significant (p <.005) differences between the conditions were found in several software-computed parameters: sleep onset latency (MPH, 39.3 minutes; placebo, 28.2 minutes), sleep efficiency (MPH, 78.0%; placebo, 80.4%), total sleep time (MPH, 7 hours; 57 minutes; placebo, 8 hours, 16 minutes). No significant differences on any of these measures were found among the 26 subjects who showed a moderate or large global improvement on MPH over placebo compared with 18 subjects who showed mild or no clinical improvement.
MPH, given twice daily, induces a slight but significant sleep disturbance. Motor activity levels during sleep did not differentiate children who responded to MPH from those who did not respond. This suggests that responders to MPH treatment do not experience greater sleep disturbances than nonresponders, at least at the dose studied.
Despite recent advances in antibiotic therapy and intensive care, sepsis remains a widespread problem in critically ill patients. The high mortality from sepsis is in part mediated by bacterial endotoxin, which stimulates macrophages/monocytes to sequentially release early (e.g., tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma) and late [e.g., high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1)] proinflammatory cytokines. Our discovery of HMGB1 as a late mediator of lethal systemic inflammation has initiated a new field of investigation for the development of experimental therapeutics. A popular Chinese herb, Angelica sinensis (also known as Dang Gui or Dong Quai) has been used traditionally for treating women with gynecological disorders (such as dysmenorrheal and hot flashes). Here we examined the effect of Angelica sinensis extract on endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release in vitro, and explored its therapeutic potential in animal models of lethal endotoxemia and sepsis [induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)] in vivo. We demonstrated that a low-molecular-weight (<10 kDa) fraction of A. sinensis extract significantly attenuated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release in part through interfering with its cytoplasmic translocation in macrophage cultures. Prophylactic administration of an aqueous extract of A. sinensis significantly attenuated systemic HMGB1 accumulation in vivo, and conferred a dose-dependent protection against lethal endotoxemia. Furthermore, delayed administration of A. sinensis extract beginning 24 h after CLP attenuated systemic HMGB1 accumulation, and significantly rescued mice from lethal sepsis. Taken together, these data suggest that A. sinensis contains water-soluble components that exert protective effects against lethal endotoxemia and experimental sepsis in part by attenuating systemic accumulation of a late proinflammatory cytokine, HMGB1.
Adrenergic modulation of lipolysis was determined in obese and lean women. Epinephrine was infused alone, or in combination with propranolol, or with phentolamine. In both obese and lean subjects slight alpha- and prevalent beta-adrenergic lipolytic responsiveness was observed. alpha-adrenergic blockade by yohimbine potentiated lipolysis and exercise energy expenditure. Yohimbine application during the slimming treatment increased weight loss without side effects.
Aging results in progressive glomerular sclerosis and reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Oxidative stress may be an important mechanism for the aging process, but to date the role of oxidative stress on renal aging has not been determined. The present study was performed to determine whether age-related alterations in renal hemodynamics and morphology were associated with oxidative stress and whether this could be attenuated by chronic administration of vitamin E. Rats, aged 13 mo, were given either control diet containing vitamin E 50 IU/kg (n = 6) or a high-vitamin E diet (5,000 IU/kg; n = 6) for 9 mo. Another group of rats (3-4 mo old; n = 7) served as young controls. Aging was accompanied by a 60% reduction in GFR, a threefold increase in renal F2 isoprostanes, newly discovered vasoconstrictive F2-like prostaglandins generated by free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation. Renal aging was also associated with an increase in oxidant-sensitive heme oxygenase, advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), and the AGE receptor, RAGE. AGE-RAGE interaction has been shown to induce oxidative stress. With high-vitamin E diet, GFR was increased by 50%, F2 isoprostanes were suppressed, and expression of heme oxygenase and RAGE was attenuated. There was also a tendency for glomerular sclerosis to be attenuated. These data demonstrate that age-related decline in renal function is accompanied by oxidative stress and that administration of antioxidants, such as vitamin E, could attenuate the decline in renal function.
Calcium is an essential signaling molecule that controls vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contraction, proliferation, and differentiation. Here, we show that the calcium antagonist nifedipine inhibits VSMC dedifferentiation in vitro and in vivo. Differentiated VSMCs cultured on laminin-coated dishes were transferred to laminin-free dishes to induce dedifferentiation. Induction of dedifferentiation resulted in the upregulation of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain expression, a marker of dedifferentiation, and the downregulation of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain expression, a marker of differentiation. Nifedipine significantly inhibited both the induction of these phenotypic changes and upregulation of Akt signaling in these cells. Administration of nifedipine at a low concentration that did not affect blood pressure could inhibit the increase in nonmuscle myosin heavy chain expression and decrease in smooth muscle myosin heavy chain expression in a rat balloon-injury model. Furthermore, nifedipine suppressed neointimal hyperplasia and upregulation of Akt signaling. However, phospho-Akt expression was not suppressed in the regenerating arterial endothelium of the nifedipine-treated rats. The inhibitory effect of the downregulation of Akt signaling by dominant-negative Akt on the induction of VSMC dedifferentiation in the intima was identical to that of nifedipine. In contrast, upregulation of Akt signaling by transfection of the cells with a constitutively active Akt reversed the nifedipine-induced inhibition of VSMC dedifferentiation. In conclusion, nifedipine inhibits VSMC dedifferentiation by suppressing Akt signaling, thereby preventing neointimal thickening.
Beijing has implemented systematic air pollution control legislation to reduce particulate emissions and improve air quality during the 2008 Summer Olympics, but whether the toxicity of fine fraction of particles (PM(2.5)) would be changed remains unclear. In present study we compared in vitro biological responses of PM(2.5) collected before and during the Olympics and tried to reveal possible correlations between its chemical components and toxicological mechanism(s). We measured cytotoxicity, cytokines/chemokines, and related gene expressions in murine alveolar macrophages, MH-S, after treated with 20 PM(2.5) samples. Significant, dose-dependent effects on cell viability, cytokine/chemokine release and mRNA expressions were observed. The cytotoxicity caused at equal mass concentration of PM(2.5) was notably reduced (p<0.05) by control measures, and significant association was found for viability and elemental zinc in PM(2.5). Endotoxin content in PM(2.5) correlated with all of the eight detected cytokines/chemokines; elemental and organic carbon correlated with four; arsenic and chromium correlated with six and three, respectively; iron and barium showed associations with two; nickel, magnesium, potassium, and calcium showed associations with one. PM(2.5) toxicity in Beijing was substantially dependent on its chemical components, and lowering the levels of specific components in PM(2.5) during the 2008 Olympics resulted in reduced biological responses.
Therapy of schizophrenia with clozapine is associated with the unpredictable development of severe neutropenia and agranulocytosis in 1% to 2% of patients. The mechanism of this effect is unknown but may involve reactive products of clozapine generated by either hepatic metabolism or oxidation by the peroxidase-peroxide system of activated neutrophils.
Involvement of reactive metabolites was tested with in vitro cytotoxicity assays with use of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 3 groups of subjects: normal control subjects, patients with schizophrenia who tolerated clozapine therapy (control patients), and patients with schizophrenia in whom agranulocytosis developed while taking clozapine (patients with agranulocytosis). Cell viability was determined after incubations with clozapine and rat liver microsomes or clozapine and horseradish peroxidase-peroxide (HRP-H2O2).
In microsomal incubations, clozapine significantly increased the cell death in all groups: control subjects (8.8%+/-1.6%), control patients (7.4%+/-0.4%), and patients with agranulocytosis (9.1%+/-1.5%). However, differences between mean values were not statistically significant. In similar incubations with HRP-H2O2, clozapine significantly increased toxicity (P < .05) in cells from patients with agranulocytosis (22%+/-4.6%) compared with those from normal control subjects (7.7%+/-4.1%) or control patients (6.5%+/-4.4%).
These results suggest that both generating systems metabolized clozapine to toxic products. Some products may play a role in clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. Of diagnostic relevance is the observation the HRP-H2O2 produces significantly greater toxicity in cells from patients with agranulocytosis than in cells from control patients. Although the exact mechanism(s) of drug activation in vivo remains unclear, the bioactivation of clozapine by HRP-H2O2 may be a useful in vitro tool for predicting which patients are at risk for agranulocytosis before initiation of therapy.
Three of our regularly controlled patients suffering from Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia and treated with clofibrate complained of impotence within one year after commencement of treatment with this drug. Two of the patients had previously suffered from myocardial infarction. Two patients observed improvement of the symptom 3 and 4 weeks after interruption of clofibrate therapy; one patient again complained of impotence when clofibrate therapy was resumed. The third patient continued intake of the drug up to the present day, and still complains of impotence.
