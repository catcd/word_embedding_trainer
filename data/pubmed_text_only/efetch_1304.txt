The formation of biliary sludge and cholelithiasis after ceftriaxone administration is not uncommon. Prompt resolution of sludge has been demonstrated with discontinuation of the drug. Despite this, cholecystectomy has been performed in symptomatic patients. Ceftriaxone is popular drug in pediatrics, but the complication is not widely appreciated in the gastroenterology and surgical literature. For this adverse effect and for cost ceftriaxone should be used with more caution. We describe two cases of children with ceftriaxone induced cholelithiasis.
This study used midazolam-induced amnesia to explore the plausibility of the estimates provided by the process dissociation procedure (PDP), which is designed to estimate the contributions of recollection (R) and automatic (A) processes to implicit memory performance. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design with 24 participants, single midazolam doses were administered intravenously, and word stem completion performance was used to calculate PDP estimates. A dissociation was observed such that midazolam decreased R but increased A estimates relative to placebo. Given that a manipulation that induces amnesia would not be expected to facilitate a memory process, these results add to the accumulating body of evidence suggesting that PDP estimates are not always theoretically plausible. Such evidence raises important questions about the use of the PDP.
Estrogen and related hormone therapies activate estrogen receptors, which in turn regulate genes for several cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Relatively little is known, however, about the impact of genetic variation in estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) on CVD risk.
To investigate whether the ESR1 c.454-397T>C polymorphism is associated with CVD risk.
Prospective study of 1739 unrelated men and women from the population-based offspring cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, who were followed up from 1971 to 1998.
Total atherosclerotic CVD events, defined as recognized or unrecognized myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, intermittent claudication, coronary heart disease death, or atherothrombotic stroke (n = 178); major atherosclerotic CVD, defined as recognized acute MI, coronary insufficiency, coronary heart disease death, or atherothrombotic stroke (n = 83); and recognized acute MI (n = 59).
Twenty percent of participants (n = 352) were homozygous for the ESR1 c.454-397C allele. After adjustment for covariates (age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and cigarette smoking), the CC genotype was significantly associated with major atherosclerotic CVD, with an odds ratio of 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.2; P =.004) compared with individuals with the CT or TT genotypes. Participants with the CC genotype had 3.0-fold greater odds of MI (95% CI, 1.7-5.2; P<.001) compared with those with the CT or TT genotype. The results remained significant when analyses were restricted to men; too few women had events to study them separately.
Individuals with the common ESR1 c.454-397CC genotype have a substantial increase in risk of MI. Whether ESR1 c.454-397T>C is causally related to MI risk or in linkage disequilibrium with 1 or more causal variants remains to be determined. These findings support the importance of estrogen receptors in CVD susceptibility, especially in men. Estrogen receptor variation also has potential to explain recent conflicting data regarding the effects of hormone therapy on CVD susceptibility in women.
This research describes an unexpected toxicity of the aflatoxin B1 towards the vitamin D receptors. Rickets is a childhood disease, and calcium deficiency is the aetiological cause in Africa, being primarily associated with nutritional problems; in this research the contribution of aflatoxin B1 exposure during the early months of life is an interesting factor to deepen in order to prevent liver damages or the development of rickets. The results show that the expression of vitamin D receptor in osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2 is significantly down-modulated by exposure to aflatoxin B1. This seems to suggest that Aflatoxin B1, toxic towards the vitamin D receptor, interferes with the actions of the vitamin D on calcium binding gene expression in the kidney and intestine. Experimental data indicate a 58% and 86% decrease if the cells are exposed to 5 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL of aflatoxin B1, respectively. These results seem to indicate that natural occurrence of the aflatoxin B1 and allelic variant of vitamin D receptor on (F allele) increase the risk of developing rickets of African children.
The localization of 5-hydroxytryptamine(4) (5-HT(4)) receptors suggests their role in the regulation of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission, a speculation that has been supported by neurochemical studies. Mesolimbic DA systems play a prominent role in mediating the behavioral effects of the abused psychostimulant cocaine, and the intent of the present study was to assess the role of 5-HT(4) receptors in the control of spontaneous and cocaine-induced activity. Systemic administration of the 5-HT(4) receptor partial agonist 1-(4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)-3-[1-butyl-4-piperidinyl]1-propa none hydrochloride (RS 67333; 0.0001-1 mg/kg) or the 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxy-benzoic acid-(diethylamino)ethyl ester hydrochloride (SDZ 205,557; 0.0001-1 mg/kg) did not significantly alter spontaneous activity, whereas SDZ 205,557 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced horizontal activity and rearing. To test the hypothesis that cocaine-elicited behaviors were modulated by 5-HT(4) receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, two separate groups of male rats were implanted with bilateral cannulas aimed at the NAc shell. Intra-NAc shell microinjections of either RS 67333 (1 or 3 microgram/0.2 microliter/side) or SDZ 205,557 (1-5 microgram/0.2 microliter/side) did not alter spontaneous activity observed after a systemic saline injection but did significantly attenuate the hyperactivity induced by systemic cocaine injection (10 mg/kg). These results support an involvement of 5-HT(4) receptors, particularly those in the NAc shell, in the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. Furthermore, these data suggest that 5-HT(4) receptors may regulate behavioral processes dependent on mesolimbic DA pathways and may provide a novel target for the development of medications useful in the treatment of both drug dependence and psychiatric disorders.
A 20-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed as having acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16)(p13 q22). She achieved complete remission (CR) after treatment with a standard dose of cytarabine(ara-C) and idarubicin. She received high dose ara-C and etoposide for the 2nd consolidation chemotherapy. On the 5th fraction of high dose ara-C, her heart rate dropped to 52/minute and returned to 72/minute after the cessation of ara-C. After achieving informed consent, we gave her another course of high dose ara-C, which once again resulted in a decreased heart rate. This suggests that the administration of high dose ara-C could cause bradycardia.
Nearly all smokers begin tobacco use in adolescence, and approximately 25% of US teenagers are daily smokers. Prenatal nicotine exposure is known to produce brain damage, to alter synaptic function and to cause behavioral anomalies, but little or no work has been done to determine if the adolescent brain is also vulnerable. We examined the effect of adolescent nicotine exposure on indices of cell damage in male and female rats with an infusion paradigm designed to match the plasma levels found in human smokers or in users of the transdermal nicotine patch. Measurements were made of DNA and protein as well as expression of mRNAs encoding genes involved in differentiation and apoptosis (p53, c-fos) in cerebral cortex, midbrain and hippocampus. Following nicotine treatment from postnatal days 30-47.5, changes in macromolecular constituents indicative of cell loss (reduced DNA) and altered cell size (protein/DNA ratio) were seen across all three brain regions. In addition, expression of p53 showed region- and gender-selective alterations consistent with cell damage; c-fos, which is constitutively overexpressed after gestational nicotine exposure, was unaffected with the adolescent treatment paradigm. Although these measures indicate that the fetal brain is more vulnerable to nicotine than is the adolescent brain, the critical period for nicotine-induced developmental neurotoxicity clearly extends into adolescence. Effects on gene expression and cell number, along with resultant or direct effects on synaptic function, may contribute to increased addictive properties and long-term behavioral deficits.
The major adverse reactions of antithyroid drugs are hematologic; aplastic anemia (AA) is one of the rarest and most severe complications. Use of recombinant human hemopoietic colony-stimulating factor was reported to be of benefit in patients who developed agranulocytosis, although there is still some doubt regarding the efficacy in AA. We present a case of a 58-year-old female patient with Graves' disease who developed AA in the third exposure to methimazole (MMI). The withdrawal of MMI and early treatment with 5 microg/kg per day recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 9 days, allowed a favorable recovery of peripheral blood cell count. We conclude that the use of hemopoietic colony stimulating factors might be a suitable means to achieve the correction of severe thionamide-induced hematologic adverse reactions.
The clinical use of doxorubicin, one of the most effective antitumor drugs, is limited by its cardiotoxicity, which results in irreversible cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. This study aimed to evaluate a gene therapy approach using adenovirus-mediated expression of p35, a baculoviral antiapoptotic gene, for alleviating doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, transduction with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing p35 (Ad2/CMVp35) but not a control adenoviral vector expressing no transgene (Ad2/CMVEV) significantly inhibited doxorubicin-induced increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the activity of caspases 8 and 3, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Direct injection of Ad2/CMVp35 into the left ventricular wall inhibited myocardial caspase 3 activity and apoptosis and improved left ventricular performance in rats treated with doxorubicin, whereas the same dose of Ad2/CMV beta gal encoding beta-galactosidase had no effect. These results suggest that adenovirus-mediated expression of p35 protects cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, possibly by inhibiting caspase activity and by reducing cellular ROS levels. Localized delivery of gene transfer vectors expressing an antiapoptotic protein such as p35 to the myocardium may represent a therapeutic approach to alleviate doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
A broad phase II study of vindesine was conducted in 79 adults with advanced malignancies. Most patients had solid tumors, particularly adenocarcinomas (59%), and 67 patients had received prior chemotherapy which included vincristine in 24 patients and vinblastine in one. Depending on tolerance to previous therapy, patients received vindesine at doses of 3-4 mg/m2 administered iv at 2-week intervals. Objective tumor regressions were seen in eight of 36 patients (one complete response, one partial response [PR], and six minor responses) with colorectal cancer, one of four patients (PR) with squamous cell cancer of the esophagus, one of four patients (PR) with malignant melanoma, and one of two patients (PR) with lymphoma. Five of 11 responding patients had received vincristine previously. Toxic effects were manageable. The results of this study justify in-depth, disease-oriented phase II evaluations of vindesine, regardless of prior therapy with other vinca alkaloids.
Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) accounts for some cardiovascular adverse effects of hyperglycemia. We investigated whether the HBP inhibitor azaserine protects against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial damage dependently of HBP. Human endothelial cells isolated from umbilical veins were exposed either to a high (30.5 mmol/l) or low concentration of glucose (5.5 mmol/l) for 4 days, followed by a stimulation with TNF-alpha (1 ng/ml, 24 h). The blockade of the rate-limiting enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibited HBP flux and oxidative stress (generation of superoxide and peroxynitrite) under the hyperglycemic condition and prevented the synergistic stimulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression by hyperglycemia and TNF-alpha. In the cells cultured under a low-glucose condition when no increased HBP flux occurred, azaserine enhanced the manganese-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein level and also inhibited the oxidative stress and the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in response to TNF-alpha. Moreover, the polyphenol resveratrol inhibited the oxidative stress and adhesion molecule expression and did not decrease the HBP flux under the hyperglycemia condition. In addition, in isolated rat aortas exposed to hyperglycemic buffer for 5 h when no significant HBP flux occurred, azaserine upregulated the MnSOD protein level and prevented decreased endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine. In conclusion, hyperglycemia independently increases oxidative stress and HBP flux, amplifies endothelial inflammation, and impairs endothelial function mainly through oxidative stress and not the HBP pathway. Azaserine protects against hyperglycemic endothelial damage through its antioxidant effect independently of inhibiting HBP pathway.
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE), complicate 2-8% of pregnancies. Few studies have examined environmental risk factors in relation to these conditions.
Our goal was to examine whether pesticide exposure during pregnancy was associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
We analyzed self-reported data from 11,274 wives of farmers enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) between 1993 and 1997. Using logistic regression models, we estimated the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for PIH and PE associated with pesticide-related activities during the first trimester of pregnancy.
First-trimester residential and agricultural activities with potential exposure to pesticides were associated with both PIH [residential AOR = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.60; agricultural AOR = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.05-2.45] and PE (residential AOR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02-1.70; agricultural AOR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.34-3.21).
Exposure to pesticides during pregnancy may increase the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Laboratory research may provide insights into relationships between pesticide exposure and hypertensive diseases of pregnancy.
Increasing evidence suggests that high selenium levels are associated with diabetes and other cardiometabolic risk factors.
We evaluated the association of serum selenium concentrations with fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and diabetes in the most recently available representative sample of the U.S. population.
We used a cross-sectional analysis of 917 adults > or = 40 years of age who had a fasting morning blood sample in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004. We evaluated the association of serum selenium, measured by inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry, and diabetes, defined as a self-report of current use of hypoglycemic agents or insulin or as fasting plasma glucose > or = 126 mg/dL.
Mean serum selenium was 137.1 microg/L. The multivariable adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for diabetes comparing the highest quartile of serum selenium (> or = 147 microg/L) with the lowest (< 124 microg/L) was 7.64 (3.34-17.46). The corresponding average differences (95% CI) in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were 9.5 mg/dL (3.4-15.6 mg/dL) and 0.30% (0.14-0.46%), respectively. In spline regression models, the prevalence of diabetes as well as glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels increased with increasing selenium concentrations up to 160 microg/L.
In U.S. adults, high serum selenium concentrations were associated with higher prevalence of diabetes and higher fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Given high selenium intake in the U.S. population, further research is needed to determine the role of excess selenium levels in the development or the progression of diabetes.
Self-mutilation is direct and deliberate harm to one's body without conscious intent to die. It is observed in both men and women with various psychiatric disorders, but most of those who self-mutilate are women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Cocaine addiction is a significant worldwide public health problem, associated with somatic, psychological, psychiatric, socioeconomic and legal complications. Amphetamine use, but not cocaine use, has previously been associated with severe self-injurious behavior.
We report here a case of a female patient with recurring self-injurious behavior ("the pleasure of bleeding") induced by cocaine abuse.
The clinical characteristics of self-mutilation are manifold and there is a lack of agreement about its etiology. The complex behavior associated with cocaine abuse may be one cause of self-mutilation. Dysfunction of the inhibitory brain circuitry caused by drug addiction could explain why this cocaine-addicted patient loses control and self-mutilates during cocaine use.
Decreasing exposure to airborne particulates was previously associated with reduced age-related decline in lung function. However, whether the benefit from improved air quality depends on genetic background is not known. Recent evidence points to the involvement of the genes p53 and p21 and of the cell cycle control gene cyclin D1 (CCND1) in the response of bronchial cells to air pollution.
We determined in 4,326 participants of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) whether four single-nucleotide polymorphisms in three genes [CCND1 (rs9344 [P242P], rs667515), p53 (rs1042522 [R72P]), and p21 (rs1801270 [S31R])] modified the previously observed attenuation of the decline in the forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the forced vital capacity (FEF(25-75)) associated with improved air quality.
Subjects of the prospective population-based SAPALDIA cohort were assessed in 1991 and 2002 by spirometry, questionnaires, and biological sample collection for genotyping. We assigned spatially resolved concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm (PM(10)) to each participant's residential history 12 months before the baseline and follow-up assessments.
The effect of diminishing PM(10) exposure on FEF(25-75) decline appeared to be modified by p53 R72P, CCND1 P242P, and CCND1 rs667515. For example, a 10-microg/m(3) decline in average PM(10) exposure over an 11-year period attenuated the average annual decline in FEF(25-75) by 21.33 mL/year (95% confidence interval, 10.57-32.08) among participants homozygous for the CCND1 (P242P) GG genotype, by 13.72 mL/year (5.38-22.06) among GA genotypes, and by 6.00 mL/year (-4.54 to 16.54) among AA genotypes.
Our results suggest that cell cycle control genes may modify the degree to which improved air quality may benefit respiratory function in adults.
Bidirectional tachycardia is an uncommon and unique arrhythmia. It typically occurs in patients with digitalis toxicity, but it can also be associated with other causes. There has been controversy regarding the origin and the mechanism of bidirectional tachycardia. Treatment of bidirectional tachycardia involves the correction of reversible factors and the use of some antiarrhythmic medication.
Polymorphisms in GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 impact detoxification of carcinogens by GSTs and have been reported to increase susceptibility to environmentally related health outcomes. Individual factors in arsenic biotransformation may influence disease susceptibility. GST activity is involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds, including catalyzing the formation of arsenic-GSH conjugates.
We investigated whether polymorphisms in GSTT1, GSTP1 and GSTM1 were associated with risk of skin lesions and whether these polymorphisms modify the relationship between drinking water arsenic exposure and skin lesions in a case control study of 1200 subjects frequency matched on age and gender in community clinics in Pabna, Bangladesh in 2001-2002.
GSTT1 homozygous wildtype status was associated with increased odds of skin lesions compared to the null status (OR1.56 95% CI 1.10-2.19). The GSTP1 GG polymorphism was associated with greater odds of skin lesions compared to GSTP1 AA, (OR 1.86 (95%CI 1.15-3.00). No evidence of effect modification by GSTT1, GSTM1 or GSTP1 polymorphisms on the association between arsenic exposure and skin lesions was detected.
GSTT1 wildtype and GSTP1 GG are associated with increased risk of skin lesions.
Focal gastric mucosal blood flow as measured by the hydrogen gas clearance method was compared with total gastric blood flow as determined by venous outflow in an isolated segment of canine stomach before, during, and after exposure to aspirin. Despite an increase in total gastric blood flow from 10.8 +/- 1.6 ml/min per chamber to 17.4 +/- 1.9 ml/min per chamber and mucosal blood flow at nonulcerated sites from 29.5 +/- 4.3 ml/min per 100 g to 83 +/- 14.4 ml/min per 100 g, mucosal blood flow at the site of aspirin-induced ulceration was significantly reduced from 29.5 +/- 4.3 ml/min per 100 g to 12.5 +/- 2.5 ml/min per 100 g. After the removal of aspirin, mucosal blood flow returned to control levels. Such a redistribution of mucosal blood flow in response to aspirin is consistent with the localized nature of acute aspirin-induced injury. The findings also explain the inability of previous methods measuring blood flow of the entire stomach to demonstrate mucosal ischemia during such injury.
A case of sotalol-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) is presented. The patient had moderately prolonged Q-T interval before medication with sotalol with further prolongation after application of this drug. Electrophysiological study during rechallenge with sotalol demonstrated a uniform ventricular tachycardia with a somewhat polymorphous onset; whether or not this tachycardia represented replication of the patient's spontaneous arrhythmia is questionable. Without antiarrhythmic drugs and during medication with pindolol ventricular tachycardia was not inducible.
The concurrence of acute coronary syndromes with allergic or hypersensitivity as well as with anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions is increasingly encountered in clinical practice and there are several reports associating mast cell activation with acute cardiovascular events in adults. It was first described by Kounis as "allergic angina syndrome" progressing to "allergic myocardial infarction". The main mechanism proposed is the vasospasm of coronary arteries. This condition has not been described in childhood. We present a 13-year-old boy, admitted to our hospital with thoracic pain, 30 min after the ingestion of an oral dose of 500 mg of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
Although butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is non-mutagenic, at high doses it has recently been associated with an increased incidence of liver tumours in laboratory rodents. To establish whether chronic liver cell injury may be involved in the genesis of these tumours, BHT was administered to rats by orogastric gavage at doses of 0, 25, 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for up to 28 days and also at daily doses of 1000 and 1250 mg BHT/kg for up to 4 days (sublethal doses). The sublethal doses induced centrilobular necrosis within 48 hr, whereas administration of BHT for 7 or 28 days caused dose-related hepatomegaly and at the highest dose level induced progressive periportal hepatocyte necrosis. The periportal lesions were associated with proliferation of bile ducts, persistent fibrous and inflammatory cell reactions, hepatocyte hyperplasia and hepatocellular and nuclear hypertrophy. Biochemical changes consisted of dose-related induction of epoxide hydrolase, dose-related changes in the ratio of cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and depression of glucose-6-phosphatase. Measurement of BHT demonstrated a dose-related accumulation in fat but not in the liver. Changes in hepatic activating and detoxifying enzyme profiles are implicated both in the mechanism of periportal hepatocyte damage and in the change of site of damage according to the dose and duration of the treatment. The persistent and active nature of the lesions in rats dosed with 500 mg BHT/kg for 28 days, combined with evidence of cell damage at doses equivalent to those associated with hepatic tumours (250 mg BHT/kg), suggests that chronic liver cell damage may be involved in their aetiology. In this and several other studies, there was no evidence that BHT causes liver damage at a dose level of 25 mg/kg/day. As this is several hundred times higher than the normal human intake, it is considered unlikely that BHT poses a threat to human health.
We examined the therapeutic effects of albendazole compared to metronidazole in 120 patients with giardiasis in Hamdan. Patients were randomized to receive albendazole (400 mg, once daily for 5 days) or metronidazole (250 mg, 3 times a day for 5 days). Demographic data of the patients, results of stool examination for Giardia trophozoites before and after treatment, and drug side-effects were recorded. After treatment 6 (10.0%) of the albendazole group had trophozoites compared with 14 (23.3%) of metronidazole group (P < 0.05). Patients in the albendazole group had fewer side-effects while 43.3% of the metronidazole group experienced a metallic taste and 35.0% experienced loss of appetite. Albendazole is an easy, safe and effective treatment for giardiasis.
To investigate whether allopurinol and benzbromarone affect the concentration of uridine in plasma, allopurinol or benzbromarone were administered to patients with gout for 3 to 6 months. Allopurinol decreased the concentrations of uridine and uric acid in plasma and the urinary excretion of uric acid, but increased the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of oxypurines and orotidine. Benzbromarone decreased the concentration of uric acid in plasma and increased the excretion of uric acid in urine. However, it did not affect the plasma concentration of uridine or oxypurines or the urinary excretion of oxypurines or orotidine. These results suggest that orotidilytic decarboxylase was inhibited by allopurinol and oxypurinol ribonucleotides and/or that phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) was consumed by conversion from hypoxanthine, allopurinol, and oxypurinol to the respective ribonucleotides, resulting in a decrease in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine leading to the decreased concentration of uridine in plasma. Furthermore, it was suggested that benzbromarone did not affect the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine or purine.
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is currently recommended as a safe smoking cessation aid for pregnant women. However, fetal and neonatal nicotine exposure in rats causes mitochondrial-mediated beta cell apoptosis at weaning, and adult-onset dysglycemia, which we hypothesize is related to progressive mitochondrial dysfunction in the pancreas. Therefore in this study we examined the effect of fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine on pancreatic mitochondrial structure and function during postnatal development. Female Wistar rats were given saline (vehicle control) or nicotine bitartrate (1 mg/kg/d) via subcutaneous injection for 2 weeks prior to mating until weaning. At 3-4, 15 and 26 weeks of age, oral glucose tolerance tests were performed, and pancreas tissue was collected for electron microscopy, enzyme activity assays and islet isolation. Following nicotine exposure mitochondrial structural abnormalities were observed beginning at 3 weeks and worsened with advancing age. Importantly the appearance of these structural defects in nicotine-exposed animals preceded the onset of glucose intolerance. Nicotine exposure also resulted in significantly reduced pancreatic respiratory chain enzyme activity, degranulation of beta cells, elevated islet oxidative stress and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared to saline controls at 26 weeks of age. Taken together, these data suggest that maternal nicotine use during pregnancy results in postnatal mitochondrial dysfunction that may explain, in part, the dysglycemia observed in the offspring from this animal model. These results clearly indicate that further investigation into the safety of NRT use during pregnancy is warranted.
We report the case of a patient who presented with cardiac and neurological signs of lithium toxicity as the result of an association with amitriptyline. These manifestations disappeared spontaneously as medication was stopped. We review the possible physiopathological mechanisms that could account for these adverse effects.
Bisphosphonates are considered a cornerstone for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy, whereas calcitonin has not been found to be as potent. We report a case of severe hypercalcemia of malignancy that developed while the patient was taking alendronate that responded to the use of calcitonin. A 73-year-old woman developed hypercalcemia of malignancy while taking weekly alendronate. The patients' serum calcium remained above 15 mg/dL despite hydration and loop diuretics for 48 hours in addition to the bisphosphonates, and resistance was suspected. Intravenous calcitonin produced a dramatic decrease within 12 hours and normal serum calcium within 24 hours of treatment. Calcitonin might be useful for hypercalcemia of malignancy resistant to bisphosphonates.
The yield of severe cirrhosis of the liver (defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology, ascites greater than 30 ml, plasma albumin less than 2.2 g/dl, splenomegaly 2-3 times normal, and testicular atrophy approximately half normal weight) after 12 doses of carbon tetrachloride given intragastrically in the phenobarbitone-primed rat was increased from 25% to 56% by giving the initial "calibrating" dose of carbon tetrachloride at the peak of the phenobarbitone-induced enlargement of the liver. At this point it was assumed that the cytochrome P450/CCl4 toxic state was both maximal and stable. The optimal rat size to begin phenobarbitone was determined as 100 g, and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47% greater than normal rats of the same body weight. The optimal time for the initial dose of carbon tetrachloride was after 14 days on phenobarbitone.
