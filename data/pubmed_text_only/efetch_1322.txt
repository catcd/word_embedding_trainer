Since verapamil and contrast media both cause depression in the electrophysiologic function of the heart and both may exert these effects by actions on ionic calcium, the possible interaction of verapamil and intracoronary contrast media on atrioventricular conduction was studied in six dogs using surface electrocardiography and HIS bundle electrogram. The effects of intracoronary injection of standard ionic media (Renografin 76) and low osmolal contrast media (Hexabrix and Hexabrix with calcium [8 mEq/L]) were compared. Each contrast media was assessed in the normal state and at four increasing doses of verapamil (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg). The PR and AH intervals were substantially prolonged by intracoronary injection of Renografin 76 in the presence of a 1.0 mg/kg dose of verapamil (172 +/- 41 msec to 724 +/- 48 msec, P less than 0.05 for PR interval, and 182 +/- 41 msec to 734 +/- 51 msec, P less than 0.05 for AH interval), with most animals developing second degree heart block (Mobitz, type I). There was no change in the HV interval. Hexabrix and Hexabrix with calcium did not cause significant changes in PR or AH intervals at similar doses of verapamil. Thus, standard ionic contrast causes severe inhibition of atrioventricular conduction in the presence of verapamil, whereas low osmolal contrast media cause no significant negative dromotropic effects either in the presence or absence of verapamil. The osmolality of contrast media is an important mechanism responsible for the depression in atrioventricular conduction attending intracoronary contrast media in the presence of verapamil.
A 76-year-old woman receiving warfarin after aortic valve replacement experienced prosthetic valve thrombosis during dicloxacillin therapy. Successful thrombolysis was achieved with tissue plasminogen activator. The international normalized ratio (INR) on admission was reduced to 1.4 and an increased warfarin dosage was required for three weeks following discontinuation of dicloxacillin treatment in order to maintain therapeutic INRs. Careful monitoring of INRs and titration of the warfarin dosage is recommended when dicloxacillin is prescribed to patients receiving warfarin.
Digitoxin is considered a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias in hemodialysis patients. In a randomized, crossover controlled study, 55 hemodialysis outpatients with sinus rhythm were prospectively investigated in two 48-h periods of electrocardiographic monitoring, one on and one off digitoxin or vice versa. The frequency of ventricular ectopic beats (mean +/- SD) which were found in 31 of 55 patients (56%), was slightly higher on hemodialysis (10 +/- 28 beats/h) than in the following 20 h (5.4 +/- 10 beats/h) and the next day off hemodialysis (3.6 +/- 6.6 beats/h); however, no difference was seen in patients on digitoxin during hemodialysis (10 +/- 29 beats/h), in the following 20 h (4.8 +/- 15 beats/h) and on the next day off hemodialysis (1.2 +/- 6.6 beats/h). The frequency of ventricular bigemini, polymorphous ectopies, couplets, more than 30 ectopies/h, salvos and tachycardias (10 vs 9 patients) on and off digitoxin was about the same (n.s., Fisher test). Supraventricular bigemini, salvos, tachycardias, and atrial fibrillation, however, occurred in significantly fewer patients on digitoxin (3 vs 13) than in those off digitoxin (P = 0.01, Fisher test). It is concluded that digitoxin does not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in hemodialysis patients. Digitoxin, however, may have a beneficial effect on the supraventricular arrhythmias frequently observed in these patients.
Secreted phospholipase A(2) of group IIA (sPLA(2)-IIA) has been involved in a variety of inflammatory diseases, including acute lung injury. However, the specific role of sPLA(2)-IIA in phosgene-induced acute lung injury remains unidentified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between sPLA(2)-IIA activity and the severity of phosgene-induced acute lung injury. Adult male rats were randomly exposed to either normal room air (control group) or a concentration of 400 ppm phosgene (phosgene-exposed group) for there are 5 phosgene-exposed groups altogether. For the time points of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h post-exposure, one phosgene-exposed group was sacrificed at each time point. The severity of acute lung injury was assessed by Pa(O2)/F(IO2) ratio, wet-to-dry lung-weight ratio, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentration. sPLA(2)-IIA activity in BAL fluid markedly increased between 1 h and 12 h after phosgene exposure, and reached its highest level at 6 h. Moreover, the trend of this elevation correlated well with the severity of lung injury. These results indicate that sPLA(2)-IIA probably participates in phosgene-induced acute lung injury.
Acute asthma attack continues to be a major cause for children admitted to the emergency room. Nebulized beta 2-adrenergic agonists are still the first-line drugs for a rapid bronchodilation effect and an easily administered drug during acute asthma attack. The bronchodilator-induced hypokalemia is thought significant in adult group, but is often ignored in children group. In this study, we conducted a randomized study to compare the laboratory and clinical effects between nebulized salbutamol and terbutaline. We found that both salbutamol and terbutaline nebulization induced a significant hypokalemia (p < 0.05). Terbutaline nebulization also significantly improved the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and respiratory rate (RR), but not venous partial pressure of oxygen (PvO2), venous carbon dioxide tension (PvCO2) and O2 saturation in venous blood (SvO2). In contrast, salbutamol improved not only PEFR and RR, but also PvO2, PvCO2, and SvO2 30 minutes of administration. In conclusion, the nebulized salbutamol, although induced a hypokalemic effect which is similar to terbutaline group, has a better effect on improving O2 saturation than nebulized terbutaline with the same dose 30 minutes after administered for children with acute asthma attack.
Methamphetamine is known to cause a cardiomyopathy which may be reversible with appropriate medical therapy and cessation of use. Late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been shown to identify fibrosis in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. We present a case of severe methamphetamine-associated cardiomyopathy in which cardiac function recovered after 6 months. Evaluation by CMR using late gadolinium enhancement was notable for an absence of enhancement, suggesting an absence of irreversible myocyte injury and a good prognosis. CMR may be useful to predict recovery in toxin-associated non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.
In 23 patients with symptomatic severe supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias the effectiveness and the side effects of a long-term therapy with the class III antiarrhythmic drug Amiodarone (Cordarone) in a dosage of 100-800 mg/die in monotherapy and combination therapy were investigated. In these cases it proved to be an excellently effecting antiarrhythmic drug in tachycardiac dysrhythmias at atrial and ventricular level with an altogether good tolerance. In 16 patients side effects appeared and above all concerned corneal micro-deposition without any clinical symptoms (10 patients). In 3 patients nuclear-medically insignificant changes of the function of the thyroid gland were found--also without clinical relevance. Three times a photosensitisation was conspicuous, only in one patient the therapy was finished on account of epigastric trouble after three months. Av-blockings of higher degree, particularly with bundle-branch block and severe sinus bradycardias as well as disturbances of the thyroid function are regarded as contraindications without preceding pacemaker implantation.
From September 1983 through November 1986, autopsies were performed on 6810 patients at the Office of the Maryland Medical Examiners; of these 40 had detectable cocaine, its metabolites, or both in body fluids. These patients were divided into two groups: natural cocaine-associated deaths (31 patients, mean age 28 +/- 5 years, blood level of cocaine 5.3 +/- 8.1 mg/L) and homicide deaths with detectable cocaine (nine patients, mean age 33 +/- 8 years, blood level of cocaine 0.3 +/- 0.3 mg/L). Cocaine-associated deaths were compared to a control group of 27 victims of sudden traumatic death (mean age 34 +/- 5 years). Total thrombotic occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery overlying mild coronary atherosclerosis occurred in one patient with cocaine-associated death. Results of histologic examination showed myocarditis (mononuclear infiltrate) in 8 of 40 (20%) patients dying with detectable cocaine in body fluids compared to 1 of 27 victims of sudden traumatic death (3.7%, p less than or equal to 0.05). Contraction band necrosis occurred in 25% of cocaine-associated deaths compared to a 41% incidence among victims of sudden traumatic death. We conclude that myocarditis occurs frequently in patients dying of cocaine abuse and may represent microvascular injury.
We are reporting a temporary, totally reversed motor and sensory paralysis subsequent to the intrathecal administration of 1.6 mg of morphine sulfate. This may represent an event which is not based on medication-induced myelopathy but on cardiovascular changes occurring as a result of pain relief.
The present case is the first report of a systemic lupus erythematosus patient which has been induced Parkinsonism with the administration of tacrolimus (TAC). A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed as lupus nephritis on September 2003. The patient had been prescribed initially 40 mg/day of prednisolone, then cyclosporine was added on May 2005. One year later, she developed severe headache, so cyclosporine was stopped, and she was prescribed tacrolimus on February 2007. However her severe headache had been disappeared, she experienced rigidity and tremor around September 2007. The Dopamine-transporter-imaging examination reavealed that she had Parkinson's disease. The gene analysis on the genetic background showed her case was the sporadic type? Parkinson's disease. Washing out of Tacrolimus, her Parkinsonism was partially improved. This fact suggested that her Parkinsonism was drug-induced type Parkinsonism. In lupus nephritis patients who have been treated with TAC, a very careful observation should be considered because neurological disorders inducing Parkinsonism may occur.
Differentiating agents have been proposed to overcome the impaired cellular differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, only the combinations of all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide with chemotherapy have been successful, and only in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (also called AML3). We show that iron homeostasis is an effective target in the treatment of AML. Iron chelating therapy induces the differentiation of leukemia blasts and normal bone marrow precursors into monocytes/macrophages in a manner involving modulation of reactive oxygen species expression and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). 30% of the genes most strongly induced by iron deprivation are also targeted by vitamin D3 (VD), a well known differentiating agent. Iron chelating agents induce expression and phosphorylation of the VD receptor (VDR), and iron deprivation and VD act synergistically. VD magnifies activation of MAPK JNK and the induction of VDR target genes. When used to treat one AML patient refractory to chemotherapy, the combination of iron-chelating agents and VD resulted in reversal of pancytopenia and in blast differentiation. We propose that iron availability modulates myeloid cell commitment and that targeting this cellular differentiation pathway together with conventional differentiating agents provides new therapeutic modalities for AML.
Inborn errors of bile acid synthesis are rare but potentially treatable causes of neonatal cholestasis. We here present a cholestatic infant with an ongoing cytomegalovirus infection who despite intensive treatment died of severe liver disease at 4 months of age.
The urinary steroids were investigated by electrospray mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Oxysterols in plasma were analysed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene were detected by PCR.
Glucuronidated bile alcohols, which are known to be excreted by patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were detected in the urine. Analysis of plasma revealed markedly reduced levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol. Mutation analysis showed the presence of a stop codon in exon 7, confirming the diagnosis of CTX, a rare disease not previously diagnosed in Sweden.
Fetal and neonatal deaths among siblings of patients with CTX have been reported previously and the present case supports the contention that reduced activity of the sterol 27-hydroxylase may predispose to the development of neonatal cholestasis. The associated viral infection may have further precipitated the liver disease. Since CTX, like other inborn errors of bile acid synthesis may be treated with bile acids an early diagnosis is essential. Thus, the analysis of urine by electrospray mass spectrometry is highly recommended in the investigation of patients with neonatal cholestasis.
We report two cases of acute renal failure following paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning. Both received adequate treatment with N-acetyl cysteine and neither showed any evidence of fulminant liver damage, yet acute renal failure due to tubular necrosis developed.
Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is an initial rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) that play a role in cell growth and differentiation. Recent studies have shown that spermidine and spermine cause injury to a variety of cells including myocytes in vitro. In this investigation, we used alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific and irreversible inhibitor of ODC activity and polyamine synthesis to test the hypothesis that polyamines contribute to myocardial injury in rat.
Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with (i) saline (0.2 ml/day, s.c.), (ii) isoproterenol (ISO) (5 mg/kg/day for 8 days, s.c.) to produce necrotizing myocardial injury, or with (iii) DFMO + ISO. DFMO was started 2 days before the initiation of ISO and both ISO and DFMO were continued until the end of the experimental period. Myocardial injury was assessed by determining the increased release of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the plasma, and by morphometric analysis of the lesion area in heart sections stained with Gomori trichrome.
ISO induced the release of CPK and LDH by 6 hr and 24 hr, respectively, and produced subendocardial necrosis, which was both acute and resolving following 8 days of ISO. DFMO treatment inhibited ISO-induced increases in (i) ODC activity and putrescine and spermidine levels in heart, (ii) CPK and LDH activity in plasma, and (iii) the area of subendocardial lesions.
These observations suggest that polyamines are one of the intracellular factors that contribute to ISO-mediated cardiac injury in the rat.
Adverse drug effects on the myocardium are often classified into toxic and hypersensitivity forms of myocarditis, each with distinct histologic findings. In contrast, giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is generally not associated with adverse drug reactions and has unique histopathologic features. We report four cases of adverse drug reactions in which the histologic findings were characteristic of GCM. The clinical recognition that GCM may be a manifestation of an adverse drug reaction is important, since the prognosis and treatment of this entity may be different from that of other forms of myocarditis.
The interaction of morphine sulphate and phenytoin was studied with respect to morphine-induced catalepsy in the rat using a previously described method for measuring degree of immobility. As expected, catalepsy developed several minutes after intravenous morphine and lasted for more than ninety minutes. Intravenous phenytoin, 35 mg/kg, given fifteen min prior to or following the administration of morphine, 1 mg/kg, significantly prevented, or reversed, morphine-induced catalepsy. Control experiments revealed that the antagonistic effect was due solely to the morphine-phenytoin interaction. A similar effect was found with naloxone, 0.2 mg/kg. The data are discussed in terms of possible sites of interaction, including synaptosomal calcium metabolism.
The pattern of Evans blue extravasation in the brain in norepinephrine-induced acute hypertension is similar to our previous observations using horseradish peroxidase as a tracer. Pretreatment with flunarizine IV resulted in significant reduction of RISA leakage in all regions of the brains of acutely hypertensive rats. The reduction in RISA leakage in the drug-treated hypertensive group is not attributable to differences in the blood pressure elevations which were not significantly different in both groups. These studies suggest a role for calcium in the increased endothelial permeability occurring in cerebral vessels in acute hypertension. Further morphological studies are required to determine whether flunarizine reduces permeability by decreasing pinocytosis.
Mice bearing mutations of copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase recapitulate spinal cord motor neuron degeneration and disease progression occurring in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We have investigated the relationship between disease progression and altered gene expression by comparing the transcriptional profiles in lumbar spinal cord, fronto-parietal cortex and hippocampus of mutant G93A-SOD1, wild-type SOD1 transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Gene expression was evaluated at 55 and 110 days of age, representing pre-symptomatic and advanced disease stages of G93A mice, respectively. Whereas no significant variations were detectable in cortical and hippocampal areas, several mutation-related changes were detected in the lumbar spinal cord at the symptomatic stage, consistent with a condition of neuronal distress. Also, at both ages, we found a number of transgene-related changes, i.e. variations occurring in both transgenic groups independently of the G93A mutation, with wild-type SOD1- and G93A-SOD1-overexpressing mice displaying global transcriptional similarity at 110 days of age. Some of the changes in common between the two transgenic groups involve genes implicated in oxidative stress, inflammation, spinocerebellar degeneration and other neurodegenerative disorders. The finding that gene expressional alterations potentially associated to cellular distress are shared by wild-type and mutant human SOD1-overexpressing mice raises the possibility that mutated (in familial ALS) or otherwise dysregulated (in sporadic ALS) SOD1 expression is a common pathogenetic substrate of the disease.
Three patients with dystrophia myotonica and echocardiographic signs of subclinical cardiopathy had cardiac side effects during oral treatment with phenytoin sodium or carbamazepine. These side effects were dose related: ventricular tachycardia appeared at a toxic serum phenytoin level in one patient and disappeared as the concentration fell within the therapeutic range, and atrioventricular block grade 1 developed in two patients at low serum carbamazepine levels, its severity increasing with the drug level. Given the risk of dangerous side effects, cardiac status needs to be carefully assessed before administration of phenytoin or carbamazepine in the treatment of dystrophia myotonica.
A clinical presentation is made of a 2-3 year follow-up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier. The patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin. The stage of olig-anuria lasted for 1-3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis. Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow-up period. The four patients re-examined were clinically cured. Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce. Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied. Renal function was normal. In three cases the excretion at 131I-hippuran renography was slightly slowed. Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded.
