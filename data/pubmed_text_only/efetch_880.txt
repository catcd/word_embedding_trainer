Our previous study has shown that genistein enhances apoptosis in A549 lung cancer cells induced by trichostatin A (TSA). The precise molecular mechanism underlying the effect of genistein, however, remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether genistein enhances the anti-cancer effect of TSA through up-regulation of TNF receptor-1 (TNFR-1) death receptor signaling. We incubated A549 cells with TSA (50 ng/mL) alone or in combination with genistein and then determined the mRNA and protein expression of TNFR-1 as well as the activation of downstream caspases. Genistein at 5 and 10 μM significantly enhanced the TSA-induced decrease in cell number and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The combined treatment significantly increased mRNA and protein expression of TNFR-1 at 6 and 12h, respectively, compared with that of the control group; while TSA alone had no effect. TSA in combination with 10 μM of genistein increased TNFR-1 mRNA and protein expression by about 70% and 40%, respectively. The underlying mechanism for this effect of genistein may be partly associated with the estrogen receptor pathway. The combined treatment also increased the activation of caspase-3 and -10 as well as p53 protein expression in A549 cells. The enhancing effects of genistein on the TSA-induced decrease in cell number and on the expression of caspase-3 in A549 cells were suppressed by silencing TNFR-1 expression. These data demonstrated that the upregulation of TNFR-1 death receptor signaling plays an important role, at least in part, in the enhancing effect of genistein on TSA-induced apoptosis in A549 cells.
There is a growing body of evidence for the role of inflammation in type 2 diabetes. In addition to the evidence presented elsewhere, evidence is emerging that many drugs that have apparent "anti-inflammatory" properties may reduce the incidence and/or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Statins have been found to lower inflammatory markers, and a post hoc analysis of the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) suggested that pravastatin may reduce the risk of developing diabetes, although the Lipid Lowering Arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) found no statistically significant effect of atorvastatin on risk of developing diabetes. Fibrates have been found to lower some markers of inflammation, and a prospective trial found that bezafibrate reduces risk of developing diabetes. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers appear to reduce some markers of inflammation, and a meta-analysis concluded that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Metformin is known to reduce the risk of developing diabetes, and more recent evidence suggests it also lowers C-reactive protein, in part because of its modest weight-reducing effect. Thiazolidinediones reduce risk of developing diabetes, and consistently lower inflammatory markers independent of adiposity effects. High-dose aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase and IkappaB kinase-beta and reduces fasting plasma glucose concentration, although there has not, as yet, been a large-scale trial to examine the effect of aspirin on the risk of developing diabetes. We conclude that although many drugs with potential anti-inflammatory properties reduce the risk of developing diabetes, it is difficult to prove that such anti-inflammatory properties contribute to their diabetes prevention since nearly all drugs have other, often more pronounced, actions. Studies with more specific inhibitors of inflammatory pathways (e.g., interleukin- 6 blockers) and mendelian randomization (genetic studies) will help determine whether targeting the inflammation axis is a fertile mechanism to treat or prevent type 2 diabetes.
To evaluate and compare the analgesic efficacy and anti-inflammatory effects of topical piroxicam gel vs eutectic mixture of local anesthetic (EMLA) cream applied to the peripheral venous cannulation site in adult volunteers.
Piroxicam gel and EMLA cream were randomly applied on the dorsum of the right and left hand of ten volunteers who acted as their own control. A venous cannula was inserted (no iv infusion) and removed after one hour. Pain scores and signs of inflammation were noted at the cannulation site up to 48 hr.
Pain scores with piroxicam gel were higher on cannulation and on advancement of the cannula (P < 0.05). Thereafter, pain scores were significantly higher with EMLA (P < 0.05). Blanching was present at all the peripheral venous sites treated with EMLA cream. Signs of inflammation (erythema, edema) were not more frequent with EMLA than with piroxicam (P > 0.05). Induration was more frequent with EMLA at six hours.
In volunteers EMLA cream is associated with less pain on cannulation and cannula advancement compared to piroxicam gel. Topical application of piroxicam gel before peripheral venous cannulation alleviates pain and, possibly, inflammation in the period subsequent to cannulation itself.
Preclinical and clinical studies indicate that females are more vulnerable to relapse than males, and the neurobiological effects of estrogen are thought to mediate, in part, the sex differences in cocaine-taking behavior. The goal of the present study was to investigate the involvement of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) in estrogen-mediated increases in cocaine-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. Rats were initially trained to self-administer cocaine (0.4 mg/kg/inf, i.v.) under a fixed-ratio 1 (FR 1) schedule of reinforcement during daily 2-h sessions. After a 10-day maintenance period, cocaine solutions were replaced with saline, and self-administration was extinguished over a 14-day period. OVX rats were then treated with either the mixed ERalpha/beta agonist estradiol benzoate (EB), the ERalpha-selective agonist, propyl-pyrazole-triol (PPT), the ERbeta-selective agonist, diarylpropionitrile (DPN), or a vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO). Treatment lasted a total of 9 days, and during this time, rats were assessed for nonreinforced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior after priming injections of saline or cocaine (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg, i.p.). OVX rats showed no differences in self-administration during maintenance or extinction. OVX rats treated with EB exhibited greater responding for cocaine during reinstatement compared to OVX+DMSO controls. Selective activation of ERbeta with DPN also increased cocaine-induced reinstatement responding, whereas selective activation of ERalpha with PPT did not affect cocaine-seeking behavior. These results indicate that estrogen influences the propensity for reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior, and that estrogen-mediated enhancement of cocaine-induced reinstatement responding involves the activation of ERbeta.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 20 patients with 'prostatitis syndromes' and confirmed urodynamic abnormalities using the alpha 1-receptor-blocking compound alfuzosin is reported. Flow rate recordings are probably the most reliable and useful objective variables in this type of investigation. There is a significant beneficial effect in the group using an active compound concerning maximal flow (p = 0.01), flow time (p = 0.03) and time to maximal flow (p = 0.01). However, compared with the group using a placebo, only the change in the maximal flow rate appeared to be significantly different. Subjective effects were more pronounced in the alfuzosin group, but the spurious nature of the subjective observations is stressed. Based on objective parameters, alfuzosin seems to be effective compared to placebo in the treatment of these patients with micturition complaints of an irritative nature and urodynamic abnormalities, while only minor side effects were noticed.
Lithium has been used for many years in the treatment and prophylaxis of affective disorders. Since 1969, evidence has been accumulating in relation to its effectiveness in the control of aggressive behaviour. This review summarizes the published evidence.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often associated with acute hyperdynamic responses, and we hypothesize that diltiazem can blunt this response. We measured the effect of a 10-mg dose of diltiazem on heart rate and mean arterial pressure during ECT. Furthermore, we assessed seizure duration by using both the cuff method and two-lead electroencephalogram. We studied 18 patients with a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study design. Diltiazem significantly reduced heart rate and mean arterial pressure just after medication, and it also significantly reduced the increases in these variables after ECT, as compared with the placebo. The use of diltiazem was, however, associated with a shortened seizure duration, possibly making ECT less effective. Because of the reduction in seizure duration, the routine administration of diltiazem may not be advisable because it can possibly interfere with the psychotherapeutic efficacy of ECT. However, diltiazem medication for ECT is potentially useful for reducing tachycardia and hypertension in high-risk patients.
Diltiazem can blunt acute hyperdynamic responses after electroconvulsive therapy, but seizure duration is also significantly reduced, possibly making this therapy less effective.
To assess the effects of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) on hemorrhage volume and functional outcomes in warfarin-related acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which has a 30-day mortality of more than 50%.
We reviewed the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic features of a consecutive series of 7 patients (median age, 87 years; 5 women) with symptomatic, nontraumatic warfarin-related acute ICH treated with intravenous rFVIIa at St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla, between December 2002 and September 2003. Prestroke baseline functional status was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale. Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale.
The international normalized ratio decreased from a mean of 2.7 before administration of rFVIIa to 1.08 after administration of rFVIIa. The median prestroke score on the modified Rankin Scale was zero. The median presenting score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 14 (range, 4-15). The mean time from onset to treatment was 6.2 hours. The mean initial dose of rFVIIa was 62.1 microg/kg. One patient underwent placement of an external ventricular drain, and another underwent craniotomy and hematoma evacuation. Five of the 7 patients survived and were dismissed from the hospital with severe disability (Glasgow Outcome Scale, 3); 2 patients died during hospitalization.
Intravenous bolus administration of rFVIIa can rapidly lower the international normalized ratio and appears to be safe for patients with warfarin-related ICH. Prospective controlled studies are needed to determine whether rFVIIa can prevent hematoma expansion and improve neurologic outcomes in patients with warfarin-related ICH.
Glutathione appears to be a major osmotic factor in the generation of bile salt-independent flow (BSIF). This study was designed to investigate its importance in the pathology of 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE)-induced cholestasis. Five-day EE treatment at the dose level of 5 mg/kg/day significantly decreased bile flow (57% of controls) and biliary glutathione secretion. Evaluation of the contribution of bile salt dependent flow (BSDF), glutathione dependent flow (GSDF) and the bile flow generated independently of both bile salts and glutathione (BS-GSIF) revealed that EE decreased all portions of the flow (63, 44 and 52% of control values, respectively). At 4 and 20 h after a single administration of the same EE dose, a significant diminution of bile flow was noted (decreases of 17 and 29%, respectively) in association with a significant fall in biliary glutathione content. Under these conditions, BSDF and BS-GSIF were not modified (98 and 112% of control BSDF values, respectively; 96 and 99% of control BS-GSIF values, respectively) while GSDF was decreased markedly, representing 65 and 50% of control values. Biliary glutathione secretion was diminished without modification of liver and blood glutathione concentration or redox status following single EE dose whereas, after 5 days of EE treatment, a significant increase in liver glutathione was observed, suggesting that EE may interfere with the glutathione secretory process. This study demonstrates that EE rapidly alters biliary glutathione content, leading to a marked decline in GSDF. This reduction may explain the decrease in BSIF produced by EE at the outset of cholestasis.
Organochlorine pesticides increase the incidence of liver cancer through a multistage process involving tumor promotion. Mirex, an organochlorine pesticide has been shown to be a tumor promoter in mouse skin. In the present study, the effects of methoxychlor, a commonly used organochlorine pesticide, on the development of papillomas in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mouse skin and induction of mouse epidermal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity were investigated and compared with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a well-known tumor promoter. Methoxychlor neither caused tumor development nor induced epidermal ODC activity. However, TPA resulted in 100% tumor incidence and 8.8 tumors per mouse after 20 weeks of promotion, and induced epidermal ODC activity.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously identified 13 loci associated with risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL). To identify additional CLL susceptibility loci, we conducted the largest meta-analysis for CLL thus far, including four GWAS with a total of 3,100 individuals with CLL (cases) and 7,667 controls. In the meta-analysis, we identified ten independent associated SNPs in nine new loci at 10q23.31 (ACTA2 or FAS (ACTA2/FAS), P=1.22×10(-14)), 18q21.33 (BCL2, P=7.76×10(-11)), 11p15.5 (C11orf21, P=2.15×10(-10)), 4q25 (LEF1, P=4.24×10(-10)), 2q33.1 (CASP10 or CASP8 (CASP10/CASP8), P=2.50×10(-9)), 9p21.3 (CDKN2B-AS1, P=1.27×10(-8)), 18q21.32 (PMAIP1, P=2.51×10(-8)), 15q15.1 (BMF, P=2.71×10(-10)) and 2p22.2 (QPCT, P=1.68×10(-8)), as well as an independent signal at an established locus (2q13, ACOXL, P=2.08×10(-18)). We also found evidence for two additional promising loci below genome-wide significance at 8q22.3 (ODF1, P=5.40×10(-8)) and 5p15.33 (TERT, P=1.92×10(-7)). Although further studies are required, the proximity of several of these loci to genes involved in apoptosis suggests a plausible underlying biological mechanism.
The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been shown to be activated in the cancer stem cells of several tumor entities. The Hh inhibitor GDC-0449 has been proven to be effective in some cancers but not yet in lung cancer. We aimed at investigating whether GDC-0449 is effective in the lung cancer cell lines HCC (adenocarcinoma) and H1339 (small-cell-lung carcinoma), whether in these cell lines stem cell-like side populations (SPs) can be identified, and whether possible effects of GDC-0449 are mediated via SPs. SPs were identified by spectrum shift and decreased fluorescence after staining with 2.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. Expression of proteins was quantified by immunofluorescence. GDC-0449 (25 and 50 μM) inhibited concentration-dependent cell growth in HCC and H1339 cells. Further, the inhibitory effects of cisplatin on cell growth were augmented. In HCC and H1339 cell lines, SPs of 0.57 and 0.46% could be identified, respectively. SP, but not non-SP, cells were able to repopulate the original tumor population. The Hh receptor smoothened was detectable in SP but not in non-SP cells, showing the activation of the Hh pathway only in SPs. GDC-0449 considerably reduced SPs in HCC and H1339 cells. We demonstrate for the first time that GDC-0449 effectively reduces cell growth in lung cancer cell lines. This effect is mediated by the inhibition of stem cell-like SPs.
Although studies have demonstrated that air pollution is associated with exacerbation of asthma symptoms in children with asthma, little is known about the susceptibility of subgroups, particularly those with atopy.
This study was designed to evaluate our a priori hypothesis that identifiable subgroups of asthmatic children are more likely to wheeze with exposure to ambient air pollution.
A cohort of 315 children with asthma, 6-11 years of age, was recruited for longitudinal follow-up in Fresno, California (USA). During the baseline visit, children were administered a respiratory symptom questionnaire and allergen skin-prick test. Three times a year, participants completed 14-day panels during which they answered symptom questions twice daily. Ambient air quality data from a central monitoring station were used to assign exposures to the following pollutants: particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter, particulate matter between 2.5 and 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10-2.5), elemental carbon, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrate, and O3.
For the group as a whole, wheeze was significantly associated with short-term exposures to NO2 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10 for 8.7-ppb increase; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.20] and PM10-2.5 (OR = 1.11 for 14.7-μg/m3 increase; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22). The association with wheeze was stronger for these two pollutants in children who were skin-test positive to cat or common fungi and in boys with mild intermittent asthma.
A pollutant associated with traffic emissions, NO2, and a pollutant with bioactive constituents, PM10-2.5, were associated with increased risk of wheeze in asthmatic children living in Fresno, California. Children with atopy to cat or common fungi and boys with mild intermittent asthma were the subgroups for which we observed the largest associations.
Chondrosarcoma is a heterogeneous collection of malignant bone tumors and is the second most common primary malignancy of bone after osteosarcoma. Recent work has identified frequent, recurrent mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in nearly half of central chondrosarcomas. However, there has been little systematic genomic analysis of this tumor type, and, thus, the contribution of other genes is unclear. Here we report comprehensive genomic analyses of 49 individuals with chondrosarcoma (cases). We identified hypermutability of the major cartilage collagen gene COL2A1, with insertions, deletions and rearrangements identified in 37% of cases. The patterns of mutation were consistent with selection for variants likely to impair normal collagen biosynthesis. In addition, we identified mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 (59%), TP53 (20%), the RB1 pathway (33%) and Hedgehog signaling (18%).
DNA polymerase δ, whose catalytic subunit is encoded by POLD1, is responsible for lagging-strand DNA synthesis during DNA replication. It carries out this synthesis with high fidelity owing to its intrinsic 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activity, which confers proofreading ability. Missense mutations affecting the exonuclease domain of POLD1 have recently been shown to predispose to colorectal and endometrial cancers. Here we report a recurring heterozygous single-codon deletion in POLD1 affecting the polymerase active site that abolishes DNA polymerase activity but only mildly impairs 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activity. This mutation causes a distinct multisystem disorder that includes subcutaneous lipodystrophy, deafness, mandibular hypoplasia and hypogonadism in males. This discovery suggests that perturbing the function of the ubiquitously expressed POLD1 polymerase has unexpectedly tissue-specific effects in humans and argues for an important role for POLD1 function in adipose tissue homeostasis.
Specific and nonspecific bronchial responsiveness may decline or disappear after cessation of exposure in the workplace in patients with occupational asthma, leading to false-negative specific inhalation challenge (SIC) results.
Twenty-two patients with suspected diisocyanate-induced asthma were studied. SIC with diisocyanates (toluene diisocyanate [TDI] or hexamethylene diisocyanate [HDI]) was carried out in a 7-m(3) dynamic chamber up to a maximum concentration of 19 parts per billion for 120 min. Methacholine inhalation challenges were performed before and 24 h after SIC with TDI or HDI. Patients who did not show an asthmatic reaction after SIC but had a greater than twofold reduction in provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)) after the first isocyanate challenge underwent a second isocyanate SIC 2 days later.
The first SIC with isocyanates elicited an asthmatic reaction in 13 patients (59%). In five patients who did not show an asthmatic reaction after the first SIC, PC(20) exhibited more than a twofold reduction. In three of the five patients, a second SIC with isocyanates elicited an immediate positive asthmatic reaction. Therefore, 3 of 16 patients (19%) were ultimately shown to have bronchial responsiveness to isocyanate; occupational asthma was demonstrated due to post-SIC monitoring of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine.
PC(20) should be systematically assessed before and after SIC with isocyanates in the absence of significant changes in FEV(1) during SIC to avoid false-negative results.
The aim of our study was to investigate the block characteristics of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 7, 8, or 9 mg administered during combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery and to elucidate the dose that produces adequate sensory blockade for surgery while minimizing the incidence of hypotension, high neuroblockade, and the need for intraoperative epidural supplementation.
Sixty women presenting for elective cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups. Group 7 received intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 7 mg, Group 8 received 8 mg, and Group 9 received 9 mg. Women in all 3 groups received intrathecal morphine 100 microg and IV hydroxyethyl starch 15 mL/kg at the time of initiation of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. Surgery began when a sensory level of T4 was achieved. Patients were monitored for block characteristics and side effects by a blinded observer. Our primary outcome was the maximum cephalad sensory block height.
There was a difference in the maximum extent of cephalad sensory block among groups (Group 7: median T2 [interquartile range T2-T3]; Group 8: median T2 [T1-T2]; Group 9: median T1 [C8-T2]; P = 0.02). However, the time taken to reach T4 was similar in all 3 groups. The incidence of hypotension requiring vasopressors was different among groups (30% in Group 7, 55% in Group 8, and 70% in Group 9; P = 0.04). No patient had inadequate anesthesia. Neonatal outcomes were similar in all 3 groups.
The lowest dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine (7 mg) provided equally rapid onset and effective anesthesia for cesarean delivery while reducing the incidence of hypotension compared with 8 and 9 mg. However, because of its shorter duration of anesthesia, it may be feasible only when the block can be reinforced using a functional epidural catheter.
Male Wistar rats were exposed to 100ppm Pb(2+) in drinking water for 10 months. Tail blood pressure, serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), the expression of 5-HT(2B) receptor in the aorta, the aortic response to 5-HT, and the pathologic changes of aorta were examined. The systolic blood pressure of Pb(2+) exposed group was significantly increased after 2 months of Pb(2+) exposure. After 10 months of Pb(2+) exposure, aortic contractile response to 5-HT was significantly decreased. There was no significant difference in the levels of serum 5-HT and the expression of 5-HT(2B) receptor between these two groups. The aortic media and the media-lumen ratio of Pb(2+) exposed group were significantly increased. These data suggest that long-term Pb(2+) exposure can increase blood pressure, and can alter the function and structure of aortic of rats. The decreased aortic response to 5-HT has little relation to the expression of 5-HT(2B) receptor and the serum level of 5-HT, maybe is a result of the aortic structural alteration.
In utero exposure to linuron, an urea-based herbicide, results in a pattern of malformations of androgen-dependent tissues in adult male rat offspring resembling that produced by some phthalate esters which are known to decrease fetal testosterone production. This study investigated the impact of in utero linuron treatment on fetal testis gene expression and testosterone production. Timed-pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered corn oil vehicle, 12.5, 25, 50 or 75mg linuron/day/kg orally from GD13 to 18. Ex vivo testosterone (T) production was significantly decreased at 50 and 75mg/kg when analyzed on a per litter basis. Unlike the phthalate esters, linuron treatment did not affect insl3, cyp17a, cyp11a or StAR mRNA expression. Control GD18 fetal testes were then incubated with increasing concentrations of linuron (1-300microM) to evaluate if linuron inhibited T production in vitro. T production was significantly reduced at 30microM and above. Progesterone production was not affected in any of the studies indicating that linuron directly inhibited testosterone production in the absence of cytotoxicity. These results indicate the malformations induced by linuron and phthalate esters in male offspring are similar because both reduce fetal T levels during the critical period of sex differentiation but suggest that the mechanisms differ.
Epimedium, a traditional Chinese herb, has been used for the remedy of coronary heart disease, impotence and osteoporosis in traditional oriental medicine. However, despite extensive pharmacological studies, the molecular mechanism of the anti-heart failure effect of epimedium is little known. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacological action mechanism of ethanol extract of epimedium (EPI-ext) on isoproterenol-induced congestive heart failure (CHF) in rats. Isoproterenol administration resulted in severe heart failure, as shown by the increased levels of left ventricular (LV) weight index and heart rate, as well as LV end diastolic pressure, and by the decreased levels of LV systolic pressure, maximal rate of LV pressure rise, and maximal rate of LV pressure decline. EPI-ext dose-dependently reversed the changes of these cardiac morphometric and hemodynamic parameters. In addition, EPI-ext significantly inhibited the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, norepinephrine, angiotensin II and brain natriuretic peptide in rats with CHF and improved the histological changes including cadiocyte hypertrophy, cadiocyte degeneration, inflammatory infiltration, and cardiac desmoplasia. Furthermore, the expression and activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9, which regulate collagen production, were also blocked by EPI-ext. Moreover, myocardial apoptosis was remarkably attenuated by EPI-ext through the regulating Bcl-2/Bax axle. In conclusion, EPI-ext ameliorates LV dysfunction and cardiac remodeling through down-regulating matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activity and myocardial apoptosis in rats with CHF.
Endogenous generation of nitric oxide and its congeners, including peroxynitrite (ONOO-), has been implicated in the mechanism of neuron loss in neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, nitric oxide donors and ONOO- can elicit both apoptosis and necrosis in neuron cultures. Here we show that nitric oxide donors and ONOO- are each able to trigger apoptosis of mouse cerebellar granule cells by an excitotoxic mechanism requiring exocytosis and NMDA receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ overload. This conclusion is supported by the following findings. Apoptosis was induced by various nitric oxide donors or by direct addition of ONOO- to differentiated cerebellar granule cell cultures that were sensitive to NMDA toxicity, but not in cerebellar granule cells that did not display NMDA-induced cell death (i.e. early days in culture) or in various glial cell populations. Donors of ONOO- or nitric oxide stimulated a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+, which was prevented by inhibitors of NMDA receptors, such as MK-801 and 5-phospho-aminovaleric acid, or by dampening neuronal electrical activity with high concentrations of extracellular Mg2+. Moreover, these treatments and the exposure of cerebellar granule cells in nominally Ca2+-free media prevented apoptotic cell death. Both the intracellular Ca2+ increase and apoptosis elicited by ONOO- or the nitric oxide donors were prevented by blocking exocytosis with tetanus toxin or botulinum neurotoxin C.
This paper investigates subjective, behavioral and neurophysiological changes due to treatment with oral sustained-release morphine in six patients with severe non-malignant pain. Patients rated their mood and clinical pain on visual analog scales (VAS). Experimental pain reactions were quantified by ratings on categorical scales and evoked cerebral potentials (LEP) in response to standardized laser stimuli. A standard auditory oddball task provided reaction time (RT), errors, N1 and P2 of late auditory evoked potentials (AEP), and a P300 component. It was used to measure vigilance and cognitive performance. In parallel with clinical pain reduction, laser pain ratings and LEP amplitudes were significantly reduced. In contrast, auditory P2 and P300 amplitude were found to be even enlarged under morphine. RT and mood also failed to indicate any sedation. It is concluded that LEP indicated the analgesic morphine effects whereas late potentials and P300 from auditory stimuli reflected the perceptual-cognitive status which, instead of being deteriorated by morphine-induced sedation, improved probably due to the removal of pain as a mental stressor.
To examine the significance of the methylation level of the p53 target and tumour suppressor genes apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1) and death-associated protein kinase-1 (DAPK-1) in 80 microdissected tumour samples from transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder and 80 tumour samples from clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as well as from non-tumourous bladder and kidney tissue. Growth-inhibitory effects of the demethylating agents 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) and zebularine were investigated in TCC and RCC cell lines. The methylation frequency of APAF-1 (DAPK-1) was 100% (77%) in TCC and 100% (33%) in RCC. The methylation levels of APAF-1 could differentiate between the individual tumour stages in TCC as well as in RCC. The APAF-1 methylation levels in RCC were significantly higher in tumours larger than 4 cm and in high-grade tumours. The methylation frequencies in normal tissue for APAF-1 (DAPK-1) were 11% (8%) in bladder tissue and 9% (5%) in kidney tissue. The growth-inhibitory effect of the demethylating agents in TCC (RT4, T24) and RCC (A498, ClearCa-5) cell lines resulted in a 17-132% prolongation of the doubling time (DT). In RCC cell lines, zebularine was superior to 5-Aza-CdR in achieving a DT prolongation. Quantitative real time RT-PCR detected a re-expression of mRNA transcripts of APAF-1 or DAPK-1. In conclusion, demethylating agents effectively retard growth of TCC and RCC cell lines. Methylation level analysis of specific genes has the potential for further tumour characterisation in TCC and RCC.
The antihypertensive and organ-protective effects of the combination of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine were examined in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.
The rats fed with a high-salt diet developed hypertension accompanied by aorta and heart hypertrophy, and impaired renal function. The animals were treated with losartan (30 mg/kg/day), nifedipine (7.8 mg/kg/day) or with a combination of both drugs for 8 weeks. At the end of the study systolic blood pressure, kidney function, organ weight, and mRNA expression were investigated.
Losartan reduced significantly the systolic blood pressure as well as the aorta and left ventricular hypertrophy. Nifedipine and its combination with losartan had similar effects on the systolic blood pressure, aorta and left ventricular hypertrophy but only the combination treatment reduced the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in aorta and brain natriuretic peptide in left ventricle significantly. Nifedipine and the combination therapy reduced proteinuria and improved urine creatinine excretion. The expression of collagen III and IV in the kidney was significantly reduced by the combination therapy.
These results indicate that although losartan and nifedipine were effective in lowering blood pressure and showed moderate organ protection, additional benefits can be expected by combination therapy with both compounds.
This report describes a patient who developed the hemolytic uremic syndrome while undergoing chemotherapy with cisplatin, bleomycin, and vincristine, for metastatic squamous cell cancer of the floor of the mouth. In spite of dialysis and plasmapheresis, the patient died. This complication has rarely been reported in association with cisplatin, bleomycin, or vincristine therapy. The etiology of this syndrome is uncertain but may be related to scleroderma-like endothelial injury and vasospasm caused by bleomycin combination chemotherapy. It is notable that the development of the hemolytic uremic syndrome in conjunction with this combination of agents has been fatal in all patients over the age of 50 with squamous cell cancers.
