Hemolytic anemia is uncommon in the general population; however, drug-induced hemolysis is not rare in hospitalized patients. We report a case of unrecognized subacute hemolytic anemia due to ceftriaxone in a geriatric patient requiring multiple blood transfusions before a correct diagnosis could be established.
Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans L. Koch has been used for cancer treatment in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. In this study, the effects of a polysaccharide-protein complex from Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans L. Koch (SPPC) on the tumor growth and immune function were assessed in sarcoma S180 and hepatoma H22 bearing mice. Results showed that SPPC significantly inhibited the growth of S180 transplanted in mice and prolonged the survival time of H22- bearing mice. In S180-bearing mice, it promoted specific and nonspecific immune response as evidenced by enhancing the activities of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and the ratio of Th1/Th2 cytokines, and increasing the percentages of CD4(+) T cells, B cells and NK cells. Furthermore, SPPC not only significantly inhibited mRNA expression and production of the immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), but also diminished arachidonic acid (AA)-metabolizing enzymes (COX-2 and CYP4A) and their products (PGE(2) and 20-HETE) in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Taken together, our results indicate that SPPC inhibits tumor growth in vivo by improving antitumor immune responses at least partly via downregulating AA-metabolic pathways in TAMs, and could act as an anti-tumor agent with immunomodulatory activity.
Although multiple medications have been studied for the treatment of cocaine dependence, no medication has been shown to have a robust effect on craving and use. This pilot project was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of gabapentin in subjects with cocaine dependence.
Thirty cocaine-dependent subjects (DSM-IV criteria) were enrolled in an 8-week, open-label trial of 1,200 mg/day of gabapentin in divided doses. Urine drug screens, subjective measures of craving, and cocaine use interviews were conducted at each weekly visit.
Baseline rating of amount and frequency of craving decreased significantly by week 8 (78% vs. 25% for amount, p = .000; 74% vs. 23% for frequency, p = .004). Positive urine drug screens for cocaine decreased from 86% at baseline to 29% at weeks 4 and 8. There were no reports of significant side effects or adverse events.
This pilot study indicates that gabapentin is safe and well tolerated and may be beneficial in the treatment of cocaine dependence. A placebo-controlled trial would be of interest.
Acetofenate (AF) is a widely used insecticide in China and other regions of southeastern Asia. A previous study showed that AF caused adverse developmental effects in zebrafish. Macrophages, which play a key role in inflammation, host defense, and reactions against a spectrum of autologous and foreign invaders, are crucial for innate immunity. However, cytotoxicity and apoptosis of macrophages caused by organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have so far received little attention. In this study, we used AF as a model chemical to investigate the cytotoxic effects of OCPs on mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Results from cell viability and apoptosis assays showed that AF induced apparent apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, AF induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage and resulted in the alteration of a series of signaling molecules including up-regulation of p53 and cytochrome c protein levels, decline of the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, and activation of the caspases cascade through caspase-9 and caspase-3. These results, for the first time, revealed that the increase of endogenous ROS and DNA damage comediating OCP-induced apoptosis in macrophages may be by the mitochondria and p53 signal pathway. Our results suggested that macrophages are involved in AF-induced adverse immune effects. Considering the ubiquitous environmental presence of OCPs, this study provided new information on the potential long-term physiological and immunological effects due to chronic exposures to OCPs.
To examine the activation of the Nalp3 inflammasome and its downstream targets following lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced stimulation in the liver.
Six-to-eight-week-old C57BL/6 chow fed mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 μg/g bodyweight LPS and sacrificed 2, 4, 6, 18 or 24 h later. LPS-induced liver damage was confirmed by a biochemical assay to detect alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. To determine if LPS stimulation in the liver led to activation of the inflammasome, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the mRNA expression of components of the Nalp3 inflammasome. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to determine the protein expression levels of several downstream targets of the Nalp3 inflammasome, including caspase-1 and two cytokine targets of caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18.
We found that LPS injection resulted in liver damage as indicated by elevated ALT levels. This was associated with a significant increase in both mRNA and protein levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the liver, as well as increased levels of TNFs in serum. We showed that LPS stimulation led to upregulation of mRNA levels in the liver for all the receptor components of the inflammasome, including Nalp3, Nalp1, pannexin-1 and the adaptor molecule apoptosis-associated speck-like, caspase recruitment domain-domain containing protein. We also found increased levels of mRNA and protein for caspase-1, a downstream target of the inflammasome. In addition, LPS challenge led to increased levels of both mRNA and protein in the liver for two cytokine targets of caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. Interestingly, substantial baseline expression of pre-IL-1β and pre-IL-18 was found in the liver. Inflammasome and caspase-1 activation was indicated by the significant increase in the active forms of IL-1β and IL-18 after LPS stimulation.
Our results show that the Nalp3 inflammasome is upregulated and activated in the liver in response to LPS stimulation.
Several different classes of antidepressants have been associated with sexual adverse effects. This double-blind, randomized trial compared the effects of nefazodone and sertraline on reemergence of sexual dysfunction in depressed patients who had experienced sexual dysfunction as a result of sertraline treatment. Depressive symptoms were also monitored.
One hundred five patients with DSM-III-R major depressive episode who were experiencing sexual dysfunction attributable to sertraline (100 mg/day) were screened for entry. Eligible patients entered a 1-week washout period that was followed by a 7- to 10-day single-blind placebo phase. Patients without symptoms of sexual dysfunction at the end of the single-blind placebo phase were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either nefazodone (400 mg/day) or sertraline (100 mg/day) for 8 weeks.
Nearly 3 times more sertraline-treated patients (76%; 25/33) experienced reemergence of sexual dysfunction (ejaculatory and/or orgasmic difficulty) than did nefazodone-treated patients (26%; 10/39) (p < .001). In addition, patients treated with nefazodone were more satisfied with their sexual functioning than were patients treated with sertraline. Both treatment groups demonstrated a similar and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms. Both drugs were well tolerated, and the overall incidence of adverse reactions was similar for both treatment groups; however, 9 sertraline-treated patients (26%) discontinued because of adverse events compared with 5 nefazodone-treated patients (12%). Of the patients discontinuing therapy for adverse events, 5 of the sertraline-treated patients did so because of sexual dysfunction reported as an adverse event, whereas only 1 of the nefazodone-treated patients discontinued therapy secondary to sexual dysfunction.
In this sample of patients with major depression who had recovered from sexual dysfunction induced by treatment with sertraline, nefazodone treatment resulted in significantly less reemergence of sexual dysfunction than did renewed treatment with sertraline and provided continued antidepressant activity.
Severe immune haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia developed in a 71-year-old female within 10 d of starting diclofenac (Voltarol) therapy. These complications resolved within 3 weeks of discontinuation of the drug and corticosteroid therapy. A warm autoantibody of the IgG type together with C3 was found in the direct antiglobulin test of the patient's RBC. The patient's serum and RBC eluate contained a warm autoantibody which reacted with all commercial panel cells without the addition of diclofenac, and gave a negative reaction with Rh null and -D- RBC. This pattern of interactions is similar to haemolysis associated with alpha-methyldopa, indicating the presence of autoantibodies directed against structural components common to all Rh antigens. The coexistence of immune thrombocytopenia and immune haemolytic anaemia is suggestive of an autoimmune disease caused by modified T-cell regulation. Although immune haemolytic anaemia is a rare complication of diclofenac therapy, our observations illustrate the severity of haemolytic anaemia in the occasional patient and stress the need for increased awareness of such a development.
The effect of controlled hypotension induced by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on the cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied in 14 patients undergoing neurosurgery. CBF was measured by thermal diffusion using a flow probe with a Peltier stack. PGE1 was injected i.v. continuously, at a dose of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. CBF tended to increase dose-dependently but not significantly by PGE1 administration. Cerebral vascular resistance was reduced significantly by every dose of PGE1 administered. Therefore, the results indicate that the cerebral vascular beds are dilated directly by PGE1. In conclusion, this study suggests that PGE1 can be used safely to control hypotension without reducing CBF during neurosurgery.
In a retrospective study of patients developing hepatitis or persistent serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) elevations while receiving isoniazid, it was found that the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was positive in nineteen cases (95%) in response to stimulation by isoniazid, isonicotinic acid and conjugates of these compounds with human serum albumin. However, no significant amount of antibody against isoniazid was detected in the sera of these patients by a sensitive radioimmunoassay. By contrast, no positive LTT was seen in normal controls or in patients receiving isoniazid without evidence of liver damage, while in patients with transient SGOT abnormalities, the LTT was positive only at the time of liver dysfunction. There was no correlation between the degree of lymphocyte transformation and the severity of liver damage. However, there were differences in the patterns of response to the four stimulatory preparations used. Thus patients with overt hepatitis most frequently responded to isoniazid, while individuals with only SGOT abnormalities showed stimulation in the LTT more often with a conjugate of isonicotinic acid and human serum albumin. It appears, therefore, that the presence of isoniazid-induced liver damage is associated with the presence of cellular hypersensitivity to the drug. The differences in lymphocyte reactivity in the two groups might indicate a potential means of predicting which individuals are at increased risk of developing overt hepatitis when exhibiting evidence of minor liver dysfunction while receiving isoniazid.
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)/arsenic trioxide (ATO) combination-based therapy has benefitted newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in short-term studies, but the long-term efficacy and safety remained unclear. From April 2001, we have followed 85 patients administrated ATRA/ATO with a median follow-up of 70 months. Eighty patients (94.1%) entered complete remission (CR). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients were 89.2% +/- 3.4% and 91.7% +/- 3.0%, respectively, and the 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS for patients who achieved CR (n = 80) were 94.8% +/- 2.5% and 97.4% +/- 1.8%, respectively. Upon ATRA/ATO, prognosis was not influenced by initial white blood cell count, distinct PML-RARalpha types, or FLT3 mutations. The toxicity profile was mild and reversible. No secondary carcinoma was observed, and 24 months after the last dose of ATRA/ATO, patients had urine arsenic concentrations well below the safety limit. These results demonstrate the high efficacy and minimal toxicity of ATRA/ATO treatment for newly diagnosed APL in long-term follow-up, suggesting a potential frontline therapy for de novo APL.
Achieving an antiviral response at a reasonable cost is a challenge in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. A previous study indicated that consensus interferon with ribavirin had promising activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1. The objective of this study was to determine the virologic response with consensus interferon or pegylated interferon alpha-2b plus weight-ribavirin in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1. Intention-to-treat analysis showed response in 37% and 41% of subjects treated with consensus interferon/ribavirin or pegylated interferon/ribavirin, respectively, with response rates of 42% and 44% observed in analysis of the per-protocol population, not a significant difference. Tolerability of the two treatment regimens was similar. In conclusion, both treatment regimens were safe and gave a similar antiviral response. It is possible that if consensus interferon is administered daily rather than three times weekly, eradication of HCV could be achieved in a larger proportion of patients infected with HCV genotype 1.
Antibiotic combination-associated nephrotoxicity was reviewed in 491 granulocytopenic patients with cancer and fever. Nephrotoxicity was defined as a rise in the serum creatinine level of more than 0.4 mg/dL. The different aminoglycosides, when combined with ticarcillin disodium, were found to have an equivalent nephrotoxic potential and, for the purpose of analysis, were combined and termed "aminoglycoside plus ticarcillin" (Ags + ticarcillin). Groups treated with gentamicin or amikacin plus cephalothin sodium were combined and termed "aminoglycoside plus cephalothin" (Ags + cephalothin). The rate of nephrotoxicity was statistically less for the Ags + ticarcillin group, eight (3.1%) of 262 patients, than for the Ags + cephalothin group, 23 (18.3%) of 126 patients. Age greater than 50 years was a potentiating factor for the occurrence of nephrotoxicity in the Ags + cephalothin group. We have concluded that for granulocytopenic patients with cancer and fever, the antibiotic combination of the Ags + cephalothin should not be used as empiric antibiotic therapy.
To assess the tolerability and side-effect profile of lithium use in a group of octogenarians attending a specialized lithium clinic.
This is a cross-sectional study looking at all patients of eighty years and over attending a lithium clinic. Charts were examined to assess renal function, thyroid function and level of side-effects during their course of lithium treatment in order to assess the tolerability of this medication in octogenarians.
Twelve patients of 80 years and over (with an average age of 83.6 years) were taking lithium for an average period of 53.7 months. They had a mean serum level of 0.42 mmol/l. No patient had to discontinue lithium therapy because of side-effects, even though some patients did develop transient abnormalities of renal function. One patient developed diabetes insipidus. One female patient developed hypothyroidism.
Lithium was well tolerated and was administered safely to this cohort of octogenarians. Monitoring of serum lithium levels and kidney and thyroid function should preferably be done in the setting of a specialized lithium clinic.
Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. Six weeks before the induction of myocardial infarction, some of the animals had been orchiectomized or ovariectomized. The animals were autopsied at regularly timed intervals on days 1, 2, 3, 8, and 15 after myocardial infarction. The gonadectomized animals manifested less severe untoward changes, survived in greater numbers, and experienced superior repair of their damaged hearts. Circulating levels of enzymes (e.g., CPK, GOT, GPT, and LDH), lipids, glucose, and BUN rose and fell during the acute necrosis and repair phases with distinct differences between the intact and castrated animals. Reciprocal changes in the weight of the adrenal and thymus glands, coupled with dynamic changes in circulating corticosterone levels, reflected marked temporal changes in the spectrum of adrenal steroids being secreted, as well as gonadal hormone mediated changes affecting adrenocortical function. The implications of these findings are that adrenocortical, androgenic, and estrogenic hormones condition the nature of the pathophysiologic response to acute myocardial infarction in rats.
Paclitaxel causes a sensory polyneuropathy with characteristic features of distal axonal degeneration. Although the exact mechanisms underlying distal axonal degeneration are unknown, paclitaxel-induced axonal degeneration has been shown to be associated with an increase in detyrosinated tubulin. Here we show that recombinant human erythropoietin prevents axonal degeneration in sensory neurons in vitro and this effect is associated with downregulation of detyrosinated tubulin. Furthermore, in an animal model of paclitaxel-induced distal sensory polyneuropathy, recombinant human erythropoietin protects against distal axonal degeneration. These findings suggest that recombinant human erythropoietin may be useful as a therapy to prevent paclitaxel-induced sensory polyneuropathy in patients undergoing chemotherapy.
This study examined the ability of salbutamol (selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist) to cause endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat aortic rings and depressor response in conscious rats. Salbutamol (0.01-100 microM) concentration dependently relaxed preconstricted aortic rings. The relaxant response was partially attenuated by either mechanical removal of the endothelium or treatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 microM). In conscious rats, either i.v. infused phenylephrine (5 micrograms/kg per min) or i.v. bolus injected L-NAME (12.8 mg/kg), but not the vehicle, caused similar sustained increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP). I.v. infused salbutamol (2-128 micrograms/kg per min, each dose for 5 min) dose dependently decreased MAP in vehicle-treated rats; the depressor responses were potentiated by hypertension induced by phenylephrine. In contrast, the magnitudes of the depressor response to salbutamol in L-NAME-treated rats were less than those in rats pretreated with phenylephrine or the vehicle. I.v. bolus injections of salbutamol (0.25-16 micrograms/kg) also caused dose-dependent and transient decreases in MAP in vehicle-treated rats. The magnitude but not the duration of the depressor response to salbutamol was less in rats treated with L-NAME, compared to those in rats given phenylephrine or the vehicle. These results suggest that endothelium-derived nitric oxide is partially involved in beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation.
With increasing drug abuse of cocaine, the chances are growing that an anaesthetist comes into contact with an acutely intoxicated patient or chronic cocaine user while on call or during his daily routine. In South America chewing coca leaves is daily practise, while in the industrialised world the drug is sniffed, smoked or injected intravenously. Clinically, cocaine is used topically in ENT and ophthalmology due to its local analgesic and strong vasoconstrictive properties. Cocaine has a similar effect on the CNS as amphetamines and produces euphoria and hallucinations. Cocaine acts indirectly on sympathetic stimulation, release of dopamine and inhibition of catecholamine metabolism. It is metabolised in the liver and by serum esterases. Intoxication with cocaine leads to respiratory depression, arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and death. If an emergency operation during acute cocaine intoxication is necessary, all sympathomimetic anaesthetic drugs must be avoided. A deep anaesthesia must be provided to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. In the literature, anaesthesia is regarded as safe for patients with chronic cocaine misuse after abstinence of 24 hours. This case report shows that, even without acute intoxication, severe cardiovascular problems are possible in patients with chronic cocaine abuse. Hence, we recommend a cocaine-free interval of at least one week before elective surgical procedures.
We investigated the hepatotoxicity induced by AQ using a glutathione (GSH)-depleted mice model. Although sole administration of either AQ or L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoxinine (BSO), a well-known GSH synthesis inhibitor, produced no significant hepatotoxicity, combined administration of AQ with BSO induced hepatotoxicity characterized by centrilobular necrosis of the hepatocytes and an elevation of plasma alanine aminotransferase activity. Pretreatment of aminobenzotriazole, a nonspecific inhibitor for P450s, completely suppressed the above hepatotoxicity caused by AQ co-treatment with BSO. Administration of radiolabeled AQ in combination with BSO exhibited significantly higher covalent binding to mice liver proteins than that observed after sole dosing of radiolabeled AQ. The results obtained in this GSH-depleted animal model suggest that the reactive metabolite of AQ formed by hepatic P450 binds to liver proteins, and then finally leads to hepatotoxicity. These observations may help to understand the risk factors and the mechanism for idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of AQ in humans.
A young male bodybuilder, consuming large doses of anabolic steroids (AS), presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with symptomatic rapid atrial fibrillation (AF). Echocardiogram revealed significant septal hypokinesis, and posterior and septal wall thickness at the upper limit of normal for highly trained athletes. The atrial fibrillation had not recurred at 10 weeks after discontinuation of AS use. Consumption of these agents in athletes has been associated with hypertension, ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and sudden death.
We report a patient who developed an acute painful proximal myopathy associated with the use of amiodarone. The temporal course, the presence of amiodarone related hypothyroidism and neuropathy, as well as the patient's improvement on drug withdrawal were consistent with a drug reaction. Muscle biopsy demonstrated an acute necrotising myopathy. The mechanism for this reaction is unclear.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an unstable radical produced during the oxidative deamination catalyzed by NO synthase (NOS) that converts L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO is also generated nonenzymatically from a group of compounds, called NO donors, such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP). NO directly or through its metabolites has been implicated in several disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since NO is a highly labile unstable free gas, we measured the stable end products, nitrite and nitrate (NOx). Here, we investigated the effect of SNP-mediated NO release in different cell types and its effect on the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP). When different cell types were induced with SNP, a significant level of NOx was detected in a time and dose-dependent manner over the spontaneous release of NOx by SNP. The astrocytes, glial, and epithelial cell lines released significantly higher level of NOx as compared to neuronal cells following the exposure of SNP. The latter group of cells was more sensitive to NO-mediated cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by the lactate dehydrogenase assay. The SNP-mediated toxicity is known to be caused by the accumulation of cyanide ions and we report that the ability of cells to protect against it depends on the levels of nitric oxide metabolites. Cell lines, such as astrocytic and epithelial, that produce more NOx are better protected against the SNP-induced toxicity than the less NOx-protecting neuronal cell lines. The possibility of differential susceptibility of neurons and astrocytes resulting from the different content of reduced glutathione is also discussed. The release of NOx was prevented by cotreatment with a NO scavenger and superoxide dismutase but not by a NOS inhibitor. The activity of NOS was decreased when cytosolic extracts were incubated with SNP. In the conditioned medium of SNP-induced cells, the level of soluble betaAPP (sAPP) was decreased, and this decrease was more apparent in neuronal than astrocytic cell lines. Taken together, these results suggest that the SNP-derived NO release is independent of the NOS pathway, that various cell types metabolize SNP differently, and that neuronal cell lines are more vulnerable with SNP treatment with lowered sAPP secretion. Since the neuronal cell lines lack a nitric-oxide-generated protective mechanism, we speculate that these cells may be the first targets of neurodegeneration by several toxic agents, including the cyanides and peroxynitrites.
Tamoxifen, a therapeutic and chemopreventive breast cancer drug, was chosen as a model compound because of acknowledged species specific toxicity differences. Emerging approaches utilizing electro-optical arrays and nanoreactors based on DNA/microsome films were used to compare metabolite-mediated toxicity differences of tamoxifen in rodents versus humans. Hits triggered by liver enzyme metabolism were first provided by arrays utilizing a DNA damage end point. The arrays feature thin-film spots containing an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) ruthenium polymer ([Ru(bpy)(2)PVP(10)](2+); PVP, polyvinylpyridine), DNA, and liver microsomes. When DNA damage resulted from reactions with tamoxifen metabolites, it was detected by an increase in light from the oxidation of the damaged DNA by the ECL metallopolymer. The slope of ECL generation versus enzyme reaction time correlated with the rate of DNA damage. An approximate 2-fold greater ECL turnover rate was observed for spots with rat liver microsomes compared to that with human liver microsomes. These results were supported by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of reaction products using nanoreactors featuring analogous films on silica nanoparticles, allowing the direct measurement of the relative formation rate for alpha-(N(2)-deoxyguanosinyl)tamoxifen. We observed 2-5-fold more rapid formation rates for three major metabolites, i.e., alpha-hydroxytamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and tamoxifen N-oxide, catalyzed by rat liver microsomes compared to human liver microsomes. Comparable formation rates were observed for N-desmethyl tamoxifen with rat and human liver microsomes. A better detoxifying capacity for human liver microsomes than rat liver microsomes was confirmed utilizing glucuronyltransferase in microsomes together with UDP-glucuronic acid. Taken together, lower genotoxicity and higher detoxication rates presented by human liver microsomes correlate with the lower risk of tamoxifen in causing liver carcinoma in humans, provided the glucuronidation pathway is active.
The high level of expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in normal podocyte foot processes suggests that VEGF has an important role in maintaining normal glomerular function. While altered VEGF expression occurs in many glomerular diseases, a direct role for VEGF in the pathogenesis of proteinuria has not been demonstrated.
Expression of VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) was examined in passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) and puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN), by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, Northern and Western blotting. Inhibition of VEGF in the PAN model was performed by administration of a blocking antibody.
In both models, glomeruli showed upregulation of VEGF and VEGF receptors compared to control animals. VEGF mRNA was increased most significantly (5-fold) at day 5 after induction of PHN, prior to the onset of proteinuria, with persistent upregulation (3-fold) at day 21. Increased VEGF mRNA was also seen in PAN, but it was less marked. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry localized VEGF predominantly to podocytes. Increased expression of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 protein was seen in glomerular endothelial cells of PHN and PAN rats by immunohistochemistry, as was VEGFR-2 mRNA by in situ hybridization. Upregulation of VEGFR-1 by endothelial cells was more striking in the PAN model than PHN. Administration of a blocking antibody to rats with PAN did not affect proteinuria, creatinine clearance or sodium excretion.
The expression of VEGF and its receptors is significantly increased in the PHN and PAN rat models of proteinuria suggesting a role for VEGF in the disease process. VEGF may have an important role in promoting glomerular repair in a variety of glomerular diseases.
Copper is an essential trace metal for physiological functions, whereas copper overload causes cytotoxicity in living organisms. Genetically determined systems regulate acquisition, distribution and storage for copper maintenance and homeostasis. The Human ATP7A copper transport ATPase modulates intracellular copper distribution, which is critical for copper-dependent enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD1). To investigate the role of zebrafish ATP7A in copper homeostasis, zebrafish atp7a gene expression was reduced for analysis of downstream cellular function. The results demonstrated that zebrafish sod1 has lower expression in atp7a-knockdown fish. Similarly, zebrafish sp1, a transcriptional regulator of sod1, also shows reduced expression in atp7a-knockdown fish. The lower expression of sod1 resulting from atp7a knockdown is independent to p53 gene activation. The knockdown of atp7a and copper chelator NeoC results in hypopigmentation and notochord deformation in zebrafish. Addition of exogenous copper alleviated the impaired development. Interestingly, both sod1 and sp1 transcripts are reduced in the presence of NeoC and increased with exogenous copper, suggesting that the expression of sod1 and sp1 are directly affected by copper status. This is the first report to demonstrate a hierarchic gene expression of copper homeostatic genes between atp7a, sp1 and sod1 in zebrafish.
To evaluate the impacts of Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) ova on the tight junction barriers in a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model.
Balb/c mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group; TNBS(+)ova(-) group and TNBS(+)ova(+) group. TNBS was used intracolonic to induce colitis and mice of the TNBS(+)ova(+) group were pre-exposed to S. japonicum ova as a prophylactic intervention. Colon inflammation was quantified using following variables: mouse mortality, weight loss, colon extent and microscopic inflammation score. Serum expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ were assessed to evaluate the systemic inflammatory response. NOD2 and its mRNA were also tested. Bacterial translocations were tested by culturing blood and several tissues. ZO-1 and occludin were chosen as the representations of tight junction proteins. Both the proteins and mRNA were assessed.
Ova pre-treatment contributed to the relief of colitis and decreased the mortality of the models. NOD2 expression was significantly downregulated when pretreated with the ova. The TNBS injection caused a significant downregulation of ZO-1 and occludin mRNA together with their proteins in the colon; ova pre-exposure reversed these alterations. Treatment with S. japonicum ova in the colitis model caused lower intestinal bacterial translocation frequency.
S. japonicum ova can maintain epithelial barrier function through increasing tight junction proteins, thus causing less exposure of NOD2 to the luminal antigens which may activate a series of inflammatory factors and induce colitis.
Xanthine oxidase is a key enzyme that catalyses hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid and the overproduction of uric acid will lead to hyperuricemia which is an important cause of gout. In the present study, three chalcone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase in vitro. Of the compounds, only Compound 1, 3,5,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone, exhibited a significant inhibitory activity on xanthine oxidase with an IC(50) value of 22.5 μM. Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the inhibition kinetics data demonstrated that it was a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase and Ki value was 17.4 μM. In vivo, intragastric administration of Compound 1 was able to significantly reduce serum uric acid levels and inhibited hepatic xanthine oxidase activities of hyperuricemic mice in a dose-dependent manner. Acute toxicity study in mice showed that Compound 1 was very safe at a dose of up to 5 g/kg. These results suggest that Compound 1 is a novel competitive xanthine oxidase inhibitor and is worthy of further development.
