A young woman, currently user of cocaine, was admitted because of acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. The coronary arteriography revealed total occlusion of the left main coronary artery. Despite the use of an intraaortic counterpulsation balloon and successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, she developed electromechanical dissociation, unresponsive to resuscitation manoeuvres.
A behavior questionnaire was used retrospectively in 21 manic-depressive children to quantitate manic-depressive behaviors before and after treatment with lithium carbonate. The study children were matched with 21 control children for age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status. The study children had significantly more seizures, relatives with psychotic disorders, allergies, food sensitivities, headaches, and abnormal behaviors in all categories measured. During treatment, manic-depressive children had a statistically significant reduction in disturbed behavior. This behavior, however, was still significantly more disturbed than normal control children.
Repeated administration of psychostimulants produces a behavioural sensitization. Amphetamine-sensitized animals are known to have a higher proportion of high-affinity states of dopamine D2 receptors (D2(High) receptors) in the striatum. We recently reported that repeated administration of a dopamine D1 receptor agonist, R-(+)-SKF38393, reverses the established behavioural sensitization to methamphetamine (MAP). To investigate the mechanisms for reversal of behavioural sensitization, we examined the effect of repeated administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist on the proportions of D2(High) receptors and the high-affinity states of dopamine D1 receptors (D1(High) receptors) in the striatum. In the striatum from the MAP-sensitized rats, the proportions of D1(High) and D2(High) receptors (28.5 +/- 1.96 and 57.5 +/- 3.58%) were higher than those in the saline-control rats (12.0 +/- 1.01 and 21.9 +/- 1.60%, respectively). Repeated administration of R-(+)-SKF38393 to the MAP-sensitized rats reduced the increased proportions of D1(High) and D2(High) receptors to 12.4 +/- 1.57 and 31.0 +/- 2.14%, respectively, which were similar to the proportions in the saline-control rats. The total densities of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors were not altered in each treatment condition. The results demonstrate that the proportions of D1(High) and D2(High) receptors in the striatum are elevated in MAP-sensitized rats, and that repeated administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist to the MAP-sensitized rats reverses the increased proportions of D1(High) and D2(High) receptors. The findings reveal postsynaptic mechanisms for the development of behavioural sensitization to MAP and the reversal of established sensitization by repeated administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist.
A 48-year-old man had type IIb hyperlipoproteinaemia which could not be satisfactorily treated with diet alone (total cholesterol 351 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dl, triglycerides 480 mg/dl). Treatment with lovastatin (an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) was then started at a dosage of 20 mg daily. After two months on the drug cholestatic jaundice developed (total bilirubin 6.15 mg/dl). The jaundice and abnormal biochemical findings regressed within two weeks of discontinuing lovastatin. All other possible causes of jaundice were excluded. These observations indicate that, in addition to hepatocellular damage, lovastatin may in rare instances also exert a cholestatic effect.
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril in a mouse model of pulmonary hypertension induced by bleomycin. Bleomycin-induced lung injury in mice is mediated by enhanced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) expression in the lung, which determines the murine strain sensitivity to bleomycin, and murine strains are sensitive (C57BL/6) or resistant (BALB/c). Bleomycin induced significant pulmonary hypertension in C57BL/6, but not in BALB/c, mice; average pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was 26.4 +/- 2.5 mmHg (P < 0.05) vs. 15.2 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively. Bleomycin treatment induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and activator protein (AP)-1 and enhanced collagen and TNF mRNA expression in the lung of C57BL/6 but not in BALB/c mice. Double TNF receptor-deficient mice (in a C57BL/6 background) that do not activate NF-kappaB or AP-1 in response to bleomycin did not develop bleomycin-induced pulmonary hypertension (PAP 14 +/- 3 mmHg). Treatment of C57BL/6 mice with enalapril significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited the development of pulmonary hypertension after bleomycin exposure. Enalapril treatment inhibited NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation, the enhanced TNF and collagen mRNA expression, and the deposition of collagen in bleomycin-exposed C57BL/6 mice. These results suggest that ACE inhibitor treatment decreases lung injury and the development of pulmonary hypertension in bleomycin-treated mice.
Over the last 10 years, eight children have received vincristine for the treatment of steroid- and cyclophosphamide-resistant nephrotic syndrome at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London. We present our experience of these eight cases and put forward a case for reassessing the effectiveness of vincristine in this disorder. In our series, two children treated with vincristine achieved complete remission with preserved renal function, including relapses in one. Both had primary steroid- and cyclophosphamide-resistant focal segmental glomerulo sclerosis (FSGS). Of the other cases, four also had primary FSGS, one familial FSGS and one mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. We discuss in general the pros and cons of vincristine therapy in nephrotic syndrome versus the cytotoxic agents that are currently used and the differences in clinical features among the responders and non-responders in this small group. In addition, we explore why this may have occurred and summarise the literature over the last 25 years, where vincristine appeared to have been beneficial, especially in secondary forms of nephrotic syndrome associated with malignancy. We conclude that vincristine therapy warrants re-examination as it could be a valuable alternative therapeutic agent in some cases of FSGS with relatively minor side effects.
Although the cerebellum is increasingly being viewed as a brain area involved in cognition, it typically is excluded from circuitry considered to mediate stimulant-associated behaviors since it is low in dopamine. Yet, the primate cerebellar vermis (lobules II-III and VIII-IX) has been reported to contain axonal dopamine transporter immunoreactivity (DAT-IR). We hypothesized that DAT-IR-containing vermis areas would be activated in cocaine abusers by cocaine-related cues and, in healthy humans, would accumulate DAT-selective ligands. We used BOLD fMRI to determine whether cocaine-related cues activated DAT-IR-enriched vermis regions in cocaine abusers and positron emission tomography imaging of healthy humans to determine whether the DAT-selective ligand [11C]altropane accumulated in those vermis regions. Cocaine-related cues selectively induced BOLD activation in lobules II-III and VIII-IX in cocaine users, and, at early time points after ligand administration, we found appreciable [11C]altropane accumulation in lobules VIII-IX, possibly indicating DAT presence in this region. These data suggest that parts of cerebellar vermis mediate cocaine's persisting and acute effects. In light of prior findings illustrating vermis connections to midbrain dopamine cell body regions, established roles for the vermis as a locus of sensorimotor integration and motor planning, and findings of increased vermis activation in substance abusers during reward-related and other cognitive tasks, we propose that the vermis be considered one of the structures involved in cocaine- and other incentive-related behaviors.
It has been suggested that the threshold limit value (TLV) for the time-weighted average (TWA), of benzene be lowered because of its possible leukemogenic effect at low exposure concentrations. This requires the development of new methods of biological monitoring. In this cross-sectional study the diagnostic power of blood and breath benzene and of urinary phenol, catechol, hydroquinone, S-phenylmercapturic acid, and muconic acid were compared in a population of 410 male workers exposed to benzene in garages, in two coke plants, and in a by-product plant. Benzene exposure was assessed by personal air sampling (charcoal tube and passive dosimeter). In all, 95% of the workers were exposed to less than 0.5 ppm benzene. According to the multiple regression equation, the muconic acid and S-phenylmercapturic acid concentrations detected in nonsmokers exposed to 0.5 ppm benzene were 0.3 mg/g and 6 micrograms/g, respectively (range 0.2-0.6 mg/g and 1.2-8.5 micrograms/g, respectively). With muconic acid very few false-positive test results were found, and this determination remained reliable even around a cutoff level of 0.1 ppm benzene. Moreover, the diagnostic power of this test proved to be good even when diluted or concentrated urine samples were not excluded. S-Phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) also performed fairly well. Blood and breath benzene as well as urinary phenol (PH) and hydroquinone (HQ) were clearly less suitable biomarkers than muconic acid (MA). Catechol (CA) was not associated with occupational benzene exposure. According to the results of biological monitoring, the skin resorption of benzene from gasoline or other fuels seems negligible. Correlation, multiple regression, and likelihood ratios consistently showed that MA and S-PMA concentrations were fairly good indicators of benzene exposure in the 0.1- to 1-ppm range, even in a population comprising both smokers and nonsmokers. PH, HQ, CA, and blood and breath benzene were less suitable, if at all, in the same exposure range.
We examined learning and expression of contextual implicit learning of a sequence of targets in a speeded target-detection task in amnesic and control participants. Amnesia was of organic origin in one participant group and induced psychopharmacologically (diazepam 7.5 or 15 mg) in another. Although the amnesic groups were able to learn the target sequence normally, their expression of sequence knowledge (priming) was attenuated when contextual support was limited. This was evaluated by studying response latencies for targets primed by between 0 and 5 preceding context locations. Whereas control participants showed priming when the current target location was primed by only two previous locations, priming was eliminated with two (but not four) previous locations by a low dose of diazepam and was eliminated even with four elements of context under a high dose of diazepam and in amnesia of organic origin. The results suggest that a function of the hippocampal memory system is to support contextual learning and performance, even when that learning is nondeclarative.
Sirolimus improves post transplant maintenance therapy in LTX. Dermal side effects causing pain and discomfort can limit patients' compliance. The package insert mentions such skin disorders as acne and rash. One case of sirolimus-induced leucocytoclastic vasculitis is reported in the literature.
From July 1998 to October 2003, Sirolimus was implemented in the immunosuppressive protocol in 23 out of 60 liver recipients. Sirolimus target levels are between 3 and <10 ng/dl. Combination with a calcineurinblocker and/or MMF (mycophenolate mofetil) depending on liver function and creatinine is standard. Weekly patient monitoring in the first month after discharge included physical examination, blood samples and immunosuppresant trough levels. Biopsies were taken from untypical efflorescences.
Three patients with non-specific effloresces were reported: one with leucocytoclastic vasculitis and one with exfoliate forearm dermatitis required change of medication while one perivascular lymphocytic eosinophilic dermatitis subsided after dose reduction. In three cases of mouth ulcer, trough levels exceeded 10 ng/dl and in six patients acne diminished after dose reduction. Eighteen out of 23 patients are still receiving sirolimus. Reasons for removal from the study were incompliance and incompatibility. Two patients died.
Immunosuppressants inevitably produce side effects in TX recipients. The positive management of troublesome side effects contributes importantly to compliance and patient survival.
We recorded spike activity induced by i.p. penicillin injections in eight rats, repeating the experiment five times per each rat, at 48-h intervals. Spike frequency was significantly reduced in all sessions subsequent to the first, without changes in penicillin blood concentrations. The penicillin model of epilepsy is therefore not advisable in studies on antiepileptic drugs with a crossover design.
Potentially life threatening rythm disturbances, such as third degree A-V block and sinus arrest without "escape rythm", represent infrequent and unexpected events during dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy. We report three cases of cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation maneuvers after dipyridamole infusion during myocardial thallium scan. On the basis of these clinical observations we suggest that a trained cardiologist and resuscitation kit should be available in nuclear lab. Moreover elderly patients may require careful screening for preexisting conduction defects and sick sinus syndrome. When dipyridamole infusion provokes severe bradyarrhythmias not related to myocardial ischemia, a transesophageal electrophysiological study should always be performed.
Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with accelerated neuronal apoptosis in the developing rodent brain. In this study, postnatal day (PND) 7 rats were treated with 20 mg/kg ketamine or saline in six successive doses (s.c.) at 2-h intervals. Brain frontal cortical areas were collected 6 h after the last dose and RNA isolated and hybridized to Illumina Rat Ref-12 Expression BeadChips containing 22,226 probes. Many of the differentially expressed genes were associated with cell death or differentiation and receptor activity. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software identified perturbations in NMDA-type glutamate, GABA and dopamine receptor signaling. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) confirmed that NMDA receptor subunits were significantly up-regulated. Up-regulation of NMDA receptor mRNA signaling was further confirmed by in situ hybridization. These observations support our working hypothesis that prolonged ketamine exposure produces up-regulation of NMDA receptors and subsequent over-stimulation of the glutamatergic system by endogenous glutamate, triggering enhanced apoptosis in developing neurons.
This study compared the relative efficacy of low-magnitude, contingent monetary vouchers, contingent buprenorphine medication, and standard counseling in promoting abstinence from illicit opioids and cocaine among opioid-dependent adults. Following an 8-week baseline period during which participants received buprenorphine maintenance treatment with no contingencies in place, 60 participants were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups for 12 weeks: (a) Participants in the voucher group earned vouchers for each opioid- and cocaine-negative urine sample, in accordance with an escalating schedule. Continuous abstinence resulted in voucher earnings equivalent to a total of 269 US dollars, which participants could exchange for material reinforcers of their choice. (b) Participants in the medication contingency group received half their scheduled buprenorphine dose for clinic attendance and the other half for remaining abstinent from opiates and cocaine. Thus, they received only half of their scheduled dose on submission of an opioid- and/or cocaine-positive urine sample. (c) Participants in standard treatment did not receive programmed consequences contingent on urinalysis results. All participants were maintained with buprenorphine according to a 3-times-per-week dosing regimen and participated in behavioral drug counseling. Retention rate did not significantly differ across the groups; however, participants in the medication contingency group achieved significantly more weeks of continuous abstinence from opiates and cocaine compared with participants in the voucher group (Ms = 5.95 and 2.90, respectively). Results suggest that the use of medication-based contingencies in combination with behavioral therapy in promoting drug abstinence may have clinical utility. Limitations of the study are discussed.
To test the hypothesis that, in lifetime captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the hypertensive effect of dietary sodium chloride supplementation.
Male SHR (aged 6 weeks) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal sodium chloride diet or were fed a high sodium chloride diet. After 2 weeks, the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later, an infusion of clonidine.
Lifetime captopril treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups. Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary sodium chloride-induced increase in MAP in both groups. Infusion of the central nervous system alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high (compared with the basal) sodium chloride diet.
In both lifetime captopril-treated and control SHR, the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the pressor effects of a high sodium chloride diet.
It is reported on lesions of the liver parenchyma after the application of dihydralazin and detajmium bitartrate with description of the clinical and morphological findings. By means of the morphological findings got in liver biopsy a clinically supposed acute virus hepatitis could be excluded. After the application of dihydralazin group cell necroses and an inflammation of the periportal fields, after detajmium bitartrate a typical intrahepatic cholestasis was in the front. The knowledge of medicamentous side-effects may avoid diagnostic and therapeutic errors in the individual case.
Ceftriaxone is known to induce reversible precipitates in the gallbladders of adults and children. However, ceftriaxone-associated gallbladder pseudolithiasis in children is rarely reported in Taiwan. We report a case of 5-year-old boy with Salmonella gastroenteritis, who was treated with ceftriaxone due to multidrug resistance and severe course. Cholelithiasis developed five days after initiation of ceftriaxone therapy and completely resolved one month after the end of treatment. Pediatricians and radiologists must be aware of this complication to prevent anxiety and unnecessary cholecystectomy.
The effects of aspirin (1950 mg/day orally) or indomethacin (75 mg/day orally) on blood pressure were investigated in normotensive volunteers and hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive medication. Aspirin (1950 mg/day) did not change blood pressure or body weight in normotensive or treated hypertensive subjects. No significant change in plasma renin concentration was seen with aspirin (1950 mg/day) in treated hypertensive subjects. Indomethacin (75 mg/day) significantly increased blood pressure in normotensive subjects and treated hypertensive subjects. Body weight increased significantly in the treated hypertensive subjects but not normotensive subjects. In treated hypertensive subjects indomethacin (75 mg/day) did not change plasma volume, but significantly decreased plasma renin concentration.
Methadone is generally believed to be devoid of neuroexcitatory properties, and its use is increasing. This paper reports two cases of myoclonus with high-dose parenteral methadone in patients with cancer under hospice care. This side effect may be dose related and/or due to the parenteral route of administration. Reduction of the dose and change of route was sufficient to eliminate the myoclonus while maintaining an adequate pain control. Possible mechanisms for methadone causing myoclonus include a redistribution of receptor saturation in the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and delta receptors. Ketamine may be an option for patients with intractable pain who develop methadone-induced myoclonus.
Marked interindividual variation exists in blood pressure response to benazepril, which is considered to have genetic basis. Our objectives were to evaluate whether the E112D polymorphism in the prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) gene has impact on blood pressure response to benazepril.
Hypertensive patients from Huoqiu County and Yuexi County of Anhui Province received daily treatment with an oral dosage of 10 mg benazepril for 15 days. Genotypes of the E112D polymorphism in the PRCP gene were determined by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Multivariate linear and Logistic regressions using generalized estimating equation model were performed in a total of 1092 patients to evaluate the association of PRCP genotypes and blood pressure response to benazepril.
Patients carrying ED or DD genotype had a less systolic blood pressure reduction (adjusted beta = -3.7 + or - 1.1, P < 0.001), a less diastolic blood pressure reduction (adjusted beta = -3.1 + or - 0.8, P < 0.001) and a lower percentage of reaching target blood pressure defined as SBP lower than 140 mmHg and DBP lower than 90 mmHg (adjusted OR = 0.6, P = 0.005) than those patients carrying EE genotype. In addition, the results from stratified analysis by county (Huoqiu or Yuexi) were similar to those observed in the pooled population.
Our data suggest that the E112D polymorphism in the PRCP gene may be a useful genetic marker to predict the antihypertensive effect of short-term benazepril treatment in hypertensive patients of Anhui Province, China.
Wilms tumors (WTs) have a complex etiology, displaying genetic and epigenetic changes, including loss of imprinting (LOI) and tumor suppressor gene silencing. To identify new regions of epigenetic perturbation in WTs, we screened kidney and tumor DNA using CpG island (CGI) tags associated with cancer-specific DNA methylation changes. One such tag corresponded to a paralog of the glioma pathogenesis-related 1/related to testis-specific, vespid, and pathogenesis proteins 1 (GLIPR1/RTVP-1) gene, previously reported to be a tumor-suppressor gene silenced by hypermethylation in prostate cancer. Here we report methylation analysis of the GLIPR1/RTVP-1 gene in WTs and normal fetal and pediatric kidneys. Hypomethylation of the GLIPR1/RTVP-1 5'-region in WTs relative to normal tissue is observed in 21/24 (87.5%) of WTs analyzed. Quantitative analysis of GLIPR1/RTVP-1 expression in 24 WTs showed elevated transcript levels in 16/24 WTs (67%), with 12 WTs displaying in excess of 20-fold overexpression relative to fetal kidney (FK) control samples. Immunohistochemical analysis of FK and WT corroborates the RNA expression data and reveals high GLIPR1/RTVP-1 in WT blastemal cells together with variable levels in stromal and epithelial components. Hypomethylation is also evident in the WT precursor lesions and nephrogenic rests (NRs), supporting a role for GLIPR1/RTVP-1 deregulation early in Wilms tumorigenesis. Our data show that, in addition to gene dosage changes arising from LOI and hypermethylation-induced gene silencing, gene activation resulting from hypomethylation is also prevalent in WTs.
Bisphenol A is widely used in polymer products for food and beverage packaging, baby bottles, dental sealants, and fillings, adhesives, protective coatings, flame retardants, water supply pipes, and compact discs, and is found in the environment and in placental tissue, fetuses and breast milk. We have recently reported that neonatal exposure to other environmental pollutants can induce persistent aberrations in spontaneous behavior and also affect learning and memory functions in the adult animal. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that pre- and perinatal exposure to Bisphenol A can induce neurotoxic effects. The present study indicates that a single exposure to Bisphenol A on postnatal day 10 can alter adult spontaneous behavior and cognitive function in mice, effects that are both dose-response related and long-lasting/irreversible. Earlier studies on neonatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have shown the cholinergic system to be a target of neurotoxicity, but here only minor effects on the nicotine-induced behavior was seen. Furthermore, Morris swim-maze and the elevated plus-maze did not reveal any effects on spatial learning and anxiety-like behaviors. The present findings show similarities with effects earlier reported after pre- and perinatal exposure to Bisphenol A, and also with effects seen after a single postnatal exposure to other POPs, such as PBDEs, PCBs and PFCs.
Carvedilol is a new beta-receptor blocking and vasodilating drug that is presently undergoing clinical trials in hypertension and coronary heart disease. In this article, the pharmacodynamic properties of carvedilol are compared with those of standard drugs. The beta-blocking activity was characterized in isolated organs and in conscious rats, rabbits, and dogs. For the beta 1-blockade in guinea pig atria, the pA10 values were 7.44 +/- 0.16 for carvedilol and 6.77 +/- 0.08 for propranolol. Carvedilol is a noncardioselective beta-blocker. The i.v. doses that inhibited the tachycardia by 50% induced by 1 microgram/kg isoprenaline were 62 micrograms/kg in dogs, 138 micrograms/kg in rabbits and 841 micrograms/kg in rats. In rabbits carvedilol was slightly more active and in rats less active than propranolol. In all models, carvedilol was much more active than labetalol or prizidilol. In contrast to propranolol, carvedilol relaxed rat aortic strips. A dose-dependent decrease in arterial blood pressure was seen in different in vivo models. The total peripheral and coronary resistance were decreased in conscious dogs. The doses required for both beta-blockade and decrease in blood pressure were in the same range. The drug was also active after oral administration. There is no hint for development of tolerance.
