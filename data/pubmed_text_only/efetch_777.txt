A 28-year-old woman with inoperable gastric carcinoma was given continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and low-dose cisplatin (CDDP) for 4 weeks while receiving intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH). Eleven days after her last treatment, she developed acute diplopia, deafness and gait ataxia, followed by severe confusion. She became markedly acidotic and hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg, necessitating intubation, dopamine treatment and hemodialysis for 7 h. She was also given thiamine. Thereafter, her blood pressure stabilized, the acidosis improved, and her deafness, diplopia, and confusion were resolved. This case suggests that FP (5-FU/CDDP) therapy toxicity, manifested as acute metabolic acidosis and Wernicke's encephalopathy, may be associated with IVH and thiamine deficiency.
The present report provides evidence to support the hypothesis that peptides released during an immune response alter CNS activity and thus may provide a means for the immune system to transmit afferent signals into the brain. Specifically, it is demonstrated that recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha), a peptide associated with the immune response to viral infection, can alter opiate withdrawal severity in a dose-dependent manner upon direct injection into brain areas essential for this phenomenon. These results are compared and contrasted with the effect of systemically injected rIFN-alpha upon opiate withdrawal. In addition, an electrophysiological investigation into the basis of the interaction of opioids and rIFN-alpha in brain structures essential for the expression of opioid activities is also presented. Finally, the effects of rIFN-alpha upon the functions of both the CNS and other systems is discussed in terms of the effects reported for other peptides associated with immune responses.
Clinical use of adriamycin, an effective chemotherapeutic agent, has been restricted because of a demonstrated dose-limiting cardiotoxicity. To study age-related differences in adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity, clinical status, developed force, ultrastructure, and lipid peroxide changes in the myocardium were investigated in two age groups of rats termed younger (Cy) and older (Co). Experimental animals (Cy + A; Co + A) received a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg of adriamycin over 2 weeks. Animals in the Co + A group showed hydroperitoneum, higher mortality, and a greater decline in weight and feed consumption. Decline in base-line developed force in papillary muscles from Cy + A and Co + A group was not significant, but responsiveness to different interventions was attenuated. Papillary muscles from the Co + A group showed a significantly lesser increase over its control (Co) group in peak developed force in response to higher Ca2+. The decline in the peak developed force due to low Ca2+ and frequency increase was also significantly less in the Co + A group. Qualitatively similar but quantitatively less or even statistically insignificant changes were seen in the younger treated (Cy + A) group compared with its controls. A greater cell damage indicated by the loss of myofibrils, swelling of the mitochondria as well as the tubular system and accumulation of lipofuscin granules was seen in the Co + A group. While there was no significant change in the malondialdehyde content in the lipofuscin granules was seen in the Co + A group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Aggressive responding following benzodiazepine ingestion has been recorded in both experimental and client populations, however, the mechanism responsible for this outcome is unclear. The goal of this study was to identify an affective concomitant linked to diazepam-induced aggression that might be responsible for this relationship. Thirty males (15 diazepam and 15 placebo) participated in the Taylor Aggression Paradigm while covertly being videotaped. The videotapes were analyzed using the Facial Action Coding System with the goal of identifying facial expression differences between the two groups. Relative to placebo participants, diazepam participants selected significantly higher shock settings for their opponents, consistent with past findings using this paradigm. Diazepam participants also engaged in significantly fewer appeasement expressions (associated with the self-conscious emotions) during the task, although there were no group differences for other emotion expressions or for movements in general.
1. Studies have shown that the angiotensin II (Ang II) AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, accentuates the orthostatic hypotensive response in anesthetized rats, and there is evidence indicating that this effect is not exclusively mediated by AT1 receptors. 2. We investigated whether the pronounced orthostatic cardiovascular response observed in losartan-treated rats involves an interference with angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) receptors. 3. Urethane-anesthetized rats were submitted to orthostatic stress (90 degree head-up tilt for 2 min). Intravenous injection of losartan (1 mg kg(-1), n=9) significantly accentuated the decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) induced by head-up tilt (-33+/-6% after losartan vs -15+/-8% control tilt). This effect was accompanied by a significant bradycardia (-8+/-3% after losartan vs -3+/-3% control tilt). Another AT1 antagonist, candesartan, did not potentiate the decrease of MAP and did not change the cardiac response induced by head-up tilt. Strikingly, administration of the Ang-(1-7) antagonist, A-779 (10 nmol kg(-1), n=5), totally reversed the bradycardic effect caused by losartan and this effect was accompanied by a tendency towards attenuation of the hypotensive response caused by losartan. 4. These findings indicate that the marked orthostatic cardiovascular response is specific for losartan, and that it may be due, in part, to an interaction of this antagonist with Ang-(1-7) receptors, probably at the cardiac level.
Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine in a distinctive context (context A). They were then extinguished in a second context (context B) prior to test for cocaine-seeking in the original training context, context A (group ABA), context B (group ABB) or no test (group AB0). Group ABA showed renewal of extinguished cocaine-seeking associated with c-Fos induction in basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Groups ABA and ABB showed test-associated c-Fos induction in prelimbic prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens (core, shell, rostral pole), striatum, lateral amygdala, perifornical hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area. Double immunofluorescence revealed that renewal-associated c-Fos was expressed in orexin-negative lateral hypothalamic neurons whereas test-associated c-Fos was expressed in orexin-positive perifornical hypothalamic neurons. Retrograde tracing from lateral hypothalamus with cholera toxin revealed only sparse dual-labeled neurons in basolateral amygdala and infralimbic prefrontal cortex, suggesting that these regions contribute to renewal of cocaine-seeking independently of their projections to lateral hypothalamus. Retrograde tracing from the ventral tegmental area suggested that hypothalamic contributions to cocaine-seeking are likewise independent of projections to the midbrain. These results suggest that renewal of cocaine-seeking depends critically on basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and infralimbic prefrontal cortex. Whereas basolateral amygdala and lateral hypothalamus contributions may be common to renewal of extinguished cocaine-, alcohol-, and sucrose-seeking, infralimbic prefrontal cortex contributions appear unique to renewal of cocaine-seeking and may reflect the habitual nature of relapse to cocaine.
Intramitochondrial calcification has been reported in heart transplant recipients treated with high-dose cyclosporine. Myocardial magnesium depletion is common in this group and, on the basis of extensive data from animal studies, would be expected to produce similar mitochondrial deposition of calcium. This prospective study investigated the occurrence of such calcification in biopsy specimens obtained serially in nine heart transplant recipients with simultaneous analysis of myocardial magnesium. During a mean follow-up of 32 weeks, 24 biopsy specimens were analyzed from nine patients. Mitochondrial calcium deposition was more marked in biopsy specimens from recipients with magnesium depletion (p < 0.025). Early toxic cyclosporine levels occurred in three recipients associated with a significant but reversible increase in mitochondrial calcification (p < 0.0001). Histologic rejection and use of calcium antagonists did not modify these findings. It is concluded that although cyclosporine toxicity does induce mitochondrial calcium deposition, such deposition can occur in the absence of toxicity should myocardial magnesium depletion be concurrent. Long-term follow-up will establish the clinical sequelae of such observations. However, when taken together with the results of this study, recent reports of attenuation of accelerated graft atherosclerosis by calcium antagonists may suggest that cyclosporine-induced myocardial magnesium depletion may have an etiologic role in this multifactorial process.
The effects of isoenzyme selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and other anti-asthma drugs on antigen-induced eosinophil recruitment and activation in guinea-pig airways was studied. Guinea-pigs were sensitized and subsequently challenged with aerosolized ovalbumin (OVA). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 24 h later. A significant increase in eosinophils and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) was detected in BAL fluid and BAL fluid supernatant respectively from OVA immunized guinea-pigs compared with sham treated animals. Guinea-pigs were treated for 7 days prior to antigen challenge with either the following drugs or the appropriate vehicle (i.p.). The selective beta 2 agonist, salbutamol (0.3 mg/kg), the PDE III inhibitor, milrinone (15 mg/kg) and the non-selective PDE inhibitor, trequinsin (1 mg/kg) had no effect on eosinophil number or EPO levels. The PDE IV inhibitor, rolipram (15 mg/kg), the mixed type III/IV PDE inhibitor, benzafentrine (15 mg/kg) and the non-selective PDE inhibitor, aminophylline (31.5 mg/kg) had no effect on eosinophil number but reduced the amount of EPO detected. The anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroids, beclomethasone (10 mg/kg) and betamethasone (4 mg/kg) and the type IV PDE inhibitor, RP 73401 (5 mg/kg) reduced both eosinophil numbers and EPO levels. These results suggest a role for the type IV PDE isoenzyme in the control of eosinophil recruitment and possibly activation in the airways.
Epidemiological data and studies in rodent models strongly support the role of estrogens in the development of breast cancers. Oxidative stress has been implicated in this carcinogenic process. We have recently demonstrated that antioxidants vitamin C or butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) severely inhibit 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced breast tumor development in female ACI rats. The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanism of antioxidant-mediated prevention of breast cancer. Female August Copenhagen Irish (ACI) rats were treated with E2, vitamin C, vitamin C + E2, BHA and BHA + E2 for up to 8 months. Superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) was suppressed in E2-exposed mammary tissues and in mammary tumors of rats treated with E2. This suppression was overcome by co-treatment of rats with E2 and vitamin C or BHA. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels determined as a marker of oxidative DNA damage were higher in E2-exposed mammary tissues and in mammary tumors compared with age-matched controls. Vitamin C or BHA treatment significantly decreased E2-mediated increase in 8-OHdG levels in the mammary tissues and in MCF-10A cells. Increased DNA damage, colony and mammosphere formation, and migration in SOD3 knocked down MCF-10A cells, and nuclear translocation of SOD3 in vitamin C-treated mammary tissues and in MCF-10A cells suggest protective role of SOD3 against DNA damage and mammary carcinogenesis. Our studies further demonstrate that SOD3, but not SOD2 and SOD1, is induced by antioxidants and is regulated through NRF2. SOD3 may thus be an important gene in defense against oxidative stress and in the prevention of estrogen-mediated breast cancer.
Any insult that affects survival of ovarian antral follicles can cause abnormal estradiol production and fertility problems. Phthalate esters (PEs) are plasticizers used in a wide range of consumer and industrial products. Exposure to these chemicals has been linked to reduced fertility in humans and animal models. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) decrease serum estradiol levels and aromatase (Arom) expression, prolong estrous cycles, and cause anovulation in animal and culture models. These observations suggest PEs directly target antral follicles. We therefore tested the hypothesis that DEHP (1-100 microg/ml) and MEHP (0.1-10 microg/ml) directly inhibit antral follicular growth and estradiol production. Antral follicles from adult mice were cultured with DEHP or MEHP, and/or estradiol for 96 h. During culture, follicle size was measured every 24 h as a measurement of follicle growth. After culture, media were collected for measurement of estradiol levels and follicles were subjected to measurement of cylin-D-2 (Ccnd2), cyclin-dependent-kinase-4 (Cdk4), and Arom. We found that DEHP and MEHP inhibited growth of follicles and decreased estradiol production compared to controls at the highest doses. DEHP and MEHP also decreased mRNA expression of Ccnd2, Cdk4, and Arom at the highest dose. Addition of estradiol to the culture medium prevented the follicles from DEHP- and MEHP-induced inhibition of growth, reduction in estradiol levels, and decreased Ccnd2 and Cdk4 expression. Collectively, our results indicate that DEHP and MEHP may directly inhibit antral follicle growth via a mechanism that partially includes reduction in levels of estradiol production and decreased expression of cell cycle regulators.
A double blind comparative study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of penfluridol and trifluoperazine in patients of chronic schizophrenia. Penfluridol was administered once weekly while trifluoperazine was administered twice daily by preparing identical capsules. The data revealed that both the compounds were similarly effective in maintaining control of symptoms of chronic schizophrenia. However, penfluridol has a definite advantage over trifluoperazine since it is administered once a week instead of twice a day.
The present study was designed to investigate the protective efficacy of eugenol against skin cancer and probe into the mechanistic aspects. Skin tumors were initiated by applying 160 nmol DMBA and promoted by twice weekly applications of 8.5 nmol TPA for 28 wk. All mice developed tumors by 13 wk of promotion. However, in mice pretreated with 30 microL eugenol, no tumors were detected until 8 wk (following anti-initiation protocol) and until 14 wk (following antipromotion protocol) of tumor promotion. PCNA and TUNEL immunohistochemistry of tumors revealed eugenol to ameliorate cell proliferation and elevate apoptosis respectively. The effect of eugenol was assessed on specific stages of carcinogenesis. Initiation with DMBA led to a significant upregulation of p53 expression with a concomitant increase in p21(WAF1) levels in epidermal cells indicating induction of damage to the DNA. However, pretreatment with eugenol led to overexpression of these genes, which probably helped stimulate apoptosis of the initiated cells. To ascertain the molecular mechanisms implicated in the antitumor promoting activity of eugenol, its effect was investigated on markers of tumor promotion and inflammation: ODC activity and iNOS and COX-2 expression, and on levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and PGE(2)). Eugenol markedly inhibited all. Eugenol also inhibited the upstream signaling molecule: NF-kappaB, which regulates the expression of these genes. TPA-induced depletion of cutaneous GSH and antioxidant enzymes armory was also precluded by eugenol. From these results, it could be concluded that eugenol markedly protects against chemically induced skin cancer and acts possibly by virtue of its antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities.
Minoxidil is an antihypertensive vasodilator with no known capability of inducing human cardiovascular pathology; however, the compound does cause a late, canine-specific lesion of the right atrium and acute right atrial and ventricular papillary muscle changes. In all the autopsy cases of minoxidil-treated humans to date, 9 cases were reported with significant right atrial or other cardiac pathology and were carefully reviewed for similarity to either the early or late canine lesion. Three new cases (G, H, and I) were added in this update to 6 cases already described. None of the 3 cases newly analyzed in this paper, as well as the previously reported 6 cases, had gross or histologic constellations which could be diagnosed as associated with minoxidil treatment. Further, the examination of autopsy cases of minoxidil-treated hypertensive right atrial histology findings appear no different than those found in the baseline non-minoxidil treated hypertensive and non-hypertensive cases.
Populations of villages of eastern India and Bangladesh and many other parts of the world are exposed to arsenic mainly through drinking water. Due to non-availability of safe drinking water they are compelled to depend on arsenic-contaminated water. Generally, poverty level is high in those areas and situation is compounded by the lack of proper nutrition. The hypothesis that the deleterious health effects of arsenic can be prevented by modification of dietary factors with the availability of an affordable and indigenous functional food jaggery (sugarcane juice) has been tested in the present study. Jaggery contains polyphenols, vitamin C, carotene and other biologically active components. Arsenic as sodium-m-arsenite at low (0.05 ppm) and high (5 ppm) doses was orally administered to Swiss male albino mice, alone and in combination with jaggery feeding (250 mg/mice), consecutively for 180 days. The serum levels of total antioxidant, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were substantially reduced in arsenic-exposed groups, while supplementation of jaggery enhanced their levels in combined treatment groups. The serum levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly increased in arsenic-exposed groups, while in the arsenic-exposed and jaggery supplemented groups their levels were normal. The comet assay in bone marrow cells showed the genotoxic effects of arsenic, whereas combination with jaggery feeding lessened the DNA damage. Histopathologically, the lung of arsenic-exposed mice showed the necrosis and degenerative changes in bronchiolar epithelium with emphysema and thickening of alveolar septa which was effectively antagonized by jaggery feeding. These results demonstrate that jaggery, a natural functional food, effectively antagonizes many of the adverse effects of arsenic.
To develop a model that relates the probability of occurrence of nephrotoxicity to the cumulative area under the curve (AUC) of amikacin serum concentration.
This was a retrospective study of two groups of patients in whom nephrotoxicity was observed after administration of amikacin. The first group consisted of patients treated with once-daily administration (ODA) [n = 13]. The second group consisted of patients treated with twice-daily administration (TDA) [n = 22].
The probability of nephrotoxicity occurrence.
The model is a powerful tool to represent and describe the influence of the dosage regimen on aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. The onset of nephrotoxicity is delayed in the ODA group (p = 0.01) for the same total daily dose among the two groups. The cumulative serum AUC values at onset of nephrotoxicity were greater for the ODA group (p = 0.029). In addition, for the same probability of nephrotoxicity occurrence (50%), the cumulative AUC for the ODA dosage regimen is 2 613 mg. h/L versus only 1 521 mg. h/L for the TDA dosage regimen. The difference in nephrotoxicity between ODA and TDA is greatest for a cumulative AUC of 2 495 mg. h/L, which corresponds to standard therapy with amikacin 900 mg/day during a 7-day period, i.e. 15 mg/kg/day for a 60kg patient with normal renal function (initial creatinine clearance >80 mL/min). For an AUC above 2 495 mg. h/L, the difference in nephrotoxicity decreases slowly to zero. This result means that ODA is especially justified when the treatment is administered over a short duration, i.e. less than 7 days.
The utility of selecting ODA in order to obtain less nephrotoxicity in comparison with TDA is therefore not established when the treatment is prolonged. In clinical use, the choice of the dosage regimen is not clear-cut, and both expected efficacy and expected toxicity must be taken into account in order to obtain an overall optimisation of each patient's therapy.
Sirolimus is an effective agent used in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after allogeneic transplantation. It also has antiproliferative effects on vascular endothelium when used to coat coronary artery stents. We noted an excess of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in a clinical trial, and retrospectively reviewed the records of 488 patients to determine the association between sirolimus and VOD. When used with cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation (Cy/TBI) conditioning, sirolimus is associated with an increased incidence of VOD (OR 2.35, P = .005). The concomitant use of methotrexate further increased this rate (OR 3.23, P < .001), while sirolimus without methotrexate was not associated with an increased risk of VOD (OR 1.55, P = .33). Mortality after VOD diagnosis was unaffected, and overall treatment-related mortality was lowest when sirolimus was used without methotrexate. Similar findings were noted in matched, related, and unrelated as well as mismatched donor subgroups. When used with busulfan-based conditioning, sirolimus use was associated with an even higher rate of VOD (OR 8.8, P = .008). Our findings suggest that sirolimus use is associated with VOD after TBI-based transplantation when used with methotrexate after transplantation. Sirolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis without methotrexate is associated with the greatest overall survival. Myeloablative doses of busulfan should not be used with sirolimus-based immunosuppression.
We report a case of chronic hepatitis C in whom liver cirrhosis was later diagnosed following abnormality of ALT levels during pegylated interferon α2a and ribavirin treatment. A 62-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C was treated with pegylated interferon α2a plus ribavirin for 72 weeks. Her HCV RNA became negative 16 weeks after the start of treatment and continued to be negative for most of the treatment duration. Her AST/ALT, ALP/γ-GTP levels became elevated soon after the initiation of treatment and thereafter remained unchanged. However, most of these levels normalized after the end of treatment. Post-treatment liver biopsy showed liver cirrhosis, probably due to the interferon treatment itself. This unusual therapeutic outcome should be considered if the levels of hepatic dysfunction during interferon treatment are severe.
Under certain conditions liver regeneration can be accomplished by hepatic progenitor cells ("oval cells"). So far, only few factors have been identified to be uniquely regulated by the "oval cell" compartment. Using macroarray analysis in a rat model of oval cell proliferation (treatment with 2-acetylaminofluorene and partial hepatectomy, AAF + PH), we identified 12 differentially expressed genes compared to appropriate control models (AAF treatment and sham operation or AAF treatment alone). Further analysis in models of normal liver regeneration (ordinary PH) and acute phase response (turpentine oil-treated rats) revealed that three out of 12 genes (thymidine kinase 1, Jun-D and ADP-ribosylation factor 4) were not affected by the hepatic acute phase reaction but similarly overexpressed in both "oval cell"-dependant and normal liver regeneration. We characterized Jun-D and ADP-ribosylation factors as novel factors upregulated in oval cells and in non-parenchymal liver cells of normally regenerating livers. However, two out of 12 differentially expressed genes were specifically expressed in oval cells: ras-related protein Rab-3b and Ear-2. On protein level, Rab-3b was increased in total liver homogenates and demonstrated only in clusters of oval cells. We postulate that Ear-2 and Rab-3b may represent novel regulatory factors specifically activated in "oval cells".
Indinavir sulfate is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This case report describes the radiographic and urologic manifestations of indinavir urolithiasis in two pediatric patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Management involves aggressive hydration and surgical intervention when indicated.
A 25-year-old woman with progressive systemic sclerosis was treated with D-penicillamine. (DPA) 30 days after starting therapy cholestatic jaundice was observed. Moreover, for two years she has taken the pill. Both drugs were discontinued, the jaundice disappeared and the laboratory findings of liver became normal. A rechallenge of D-penicillamine after 9 months induced no reaction. An underlying chronic liver disease before cholestasis could be excluded by liver biopsy. Allergic cutantests and lymphocyte transformation test with D-penicillamine and penicillin gave normal results. The frequency of cholestatic jaundice caused by DPA-therapy is discussed and the possible pathomechanism analyzed.

The blood-brain barrier minimizes the entry of macromolecules into brain tissue. During acute increases in arterial blood pressure, disruption of the blood-brain barrier occurs primarily in cerebral venules and veins. Mechanisms by which increases in cerebral venous pressure produce disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension are not clear. The goal of this study was to determine the role of activation of protein kinase C in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. We examined the microcirculation of the cerebrum in vivo. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by the formation of venular leaky sites and clearance of fluorescent-labeled albumin (FITC-albumin) before and during phenylephrine-induced acute hypertension. In addition, we examined changes in pial arteriolar and pial venular pressure before and during phenylephrine-induced acute hypertension. We compared responses of the blood-brain barrier to acute hypertension in control (untreated) rats and in rats treated with inhibitors of protein kinase C; calphostin C (0.1 microM) or sphingosine (1.0 microM). Under control conditions, no venular leaky sites were visible and clearance of FITC-albumin was minimal in all groups. Phenylephrine infusion increased systemic arterial, pial arteriolar and pial venular pressures, and increased the formation of venular leaky sites and clearance of FITC-albumin by a similar magnitude in all groups. The findings of the present study suggest that inhibition of protein kinase C does not significantly alter the formation of venular leaky sites and/or clearance of FITC-albumin during acute hypertension. Thus, disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension does not appear to be influenced by activation of protein kinase C.
