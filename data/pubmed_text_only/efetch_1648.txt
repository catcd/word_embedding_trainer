KCNK1, a member of the family of two-pore K(+) ion channels, is specifically induced in the livers of male mice after phenobarbital treatment. Here, we have determined the molecular mechanism of this male-specific activation of the Kcnk1 gene and characterized KCNK1 as a phenobarbital-inducible antihyperplasia factor. Upon activation by phenobarbital, nuclear receptor CAR binds the 97-bp response element (-2441/-2345) within the Kcnk1 promoter. This binding is observed in the livers of male mice, but not in the livers of female mice and requires the pituitary gland, because hypophysectomy abrogates it. Hyperplasia further progressed in the livers of Kcnk1 ( -/- ) male mice compared with those of Kcnk1 ( +/+ ) males after phenobarbital treatment. Thus, KCNK1 suppresses phenobarbital-induced hyperplasia. These results indicate that phenobarbital treatment induces KCNK1 to elicit a male-specific and growth-suppressing signal. Thus, KCNK1 and Kcnk1 ( -/- ) mice provide an experimental tool for further investigation into the molecular mechanism of CAR-mediated promotion of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.
We believe, then, that our patient represents an infrequently reported form of tetracycline toxicity. She developed a picture consistent with multisystem involvement, with a positive ANA test. All of the toxic manifestations were reversed upon withdrawal of the drug.
Serotonergic medications with various mechanisms of action are used to treat psychiatric disorders and are being investigated as treatments for drug dependence. The occurrence of fenfluramine-associated valvular heart disease (VHD) has raised concerns that other serotonergic medications might also increase the risk of developing VHD. We hypothesized that fenfluramine or its metabolite norfenfluramine and other medications known to produce VHD have preferentially high affinities for a particular serotonin receptor subtype capable of stimulating mitogenesis.
Medications known or suspected to cause VHD (positive controls) and medications not associated with VHD (negative controls) were screened for activity at 11 cloned serotonin receptor subtypes by use of ligand-binding methods and functional assays. The positive control drugs were (+/-)-fenfluramine; (+)-fenfluramine; (-)-fenfluramine; its metabolites (+/-)-norfenfluramine, (+)-norfenfluramine, and (-)-norfenfluramine; ergotamine; and methysergide and its metabolite methylergonovine. The negative control drugs were phentermine, fluoxetine, its metabolite norfluoxetine, and trazodone and its active metabolite m-chlorophenylpiperazine. (+/-)-, (+)-, and (-)-Norfenfluramine, ergotamine, and methylergonovine all had preferentially high affinities for the cloned human serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor and were partial to full agonists at the 5-HT(2B) receptor.
Our data imply that activation of 5-HT(2B) receptors is necessary to produce VHD and that serotonergic medications that do not activate 5-HT(2B) receptors are unlikely to produce VHD. We suggest that all clinically available medications with serotonergic activity and their active metabolites be screened for agonist activity at 5-HT(2B) receptors and that clinicians should consider suspending their use of medications with significant activity at 5-HT(2B) receptors.
Neurochemical studies document involvement of benzodiazepine (BDZ) and mu opioid receptors in seizure development and their possible age-related role during epileptogenesis. To study developmental changes of this role LiCl/pilocarpine status epilepticus (SE) was induced in P12, P25 and/or adult rats. This SE leads to epilepsy in all adult and subpopulation of immature rats. Using in vitro autoradiography, benzodiazepine (BDZ) and mu opioid receptor binding was evaluated 1 week (early phase of epileptogenesis) and 3 months (chronic phase) after SE in 27 brain structures involved in seizure generation and spread (amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei). The pattern of receptor binding changes was related to the age at SE, interval after SE and to brain structures. Enhanced BDZ binding was found 1 week after SE in many cortical areas in P12 and also in the amygdala complex and dentate gyrus in both P12 and P25. No changes of BDZ binding occurred in adults at that time, but 3 months after SE a decrease of binding appeared in all evaluated areas in both adult and P25 but not P12 rats. This decrease did not reflect neuronal loss. mu opioid receptors were less significantly affected but clear tendency to decrease binding occurred in adult rats in various cortical, amygdala and thalamic regions early after SE. Changes were less expressed in immature rats. Our data support the hypothesis that age-related changes of receptor properties may participate in different functional consequences of SE including epileptogenesis (more common in older age groups) and behavioral changes.
This is a case study of Fusarium keratitis progressing to endophthatmitis that was successfully treated with a tiposomal formulation of amphotericin B (AmBisome] and local natamycin 5%.
A 41-year-old man presented with a clinical picture of endophthalmitis following deep Fusarium solani keratitis. Treatment with natamycin 5% drops and intravenous amphotericin B 150 mg per day caused renal failure and did not alleviate the endophthalmitis. Therefore, intravenous amphotericin B was replaced with intravenous AmBisome, 300 mg per day, to a cumulative dosage of 5.4 g.
Both the endophthalmitis and keratitis were alleviated within several weeks after starting AmBisome treatment. No systemic toxicity was noted. The final ophthalmoLogic examination showed a paracentral corneal scar, and a satisfactory best corrected visual acuity of 20/40.
Due to their relatively low systemic toxicity, liposomal formulations of amphotericin B can be administered in higher doses than traditional unencapsulated ntravenous amphotericin B achieving higher concentrations in the target organ.
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is of universal biological significance. It has emerged as an important global RNA, DNA and translation regulatory pathway. By systematically sequencing 737 genes (annotated in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation database) on the human X chromosome in 250 families with X-linked mental retardation, we identified mutations in the UPF3 regulator of nonsense transcripts homolog B (yeast) (UPF3B) leading to protein truncations in three families: two with the Lujan-Fryns phenotype and one with the FG phenotype. We also identified a missense mutation in another family with nonsyndromic mental retardation. Three mutations lead to the introduction of a premature termination codon and subsequent NMD of mutant UPF3B mRNA. Protein blot analysis using lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals showed an absence of the UPF3B protein in two families. The UPF3B protein is an important component of the NMD surveillance machinery. Our results directly implicate abnormalities of NMD in human disease and suggest at least partial redundancy of NMD pathways.
Exposure to a low dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) produces a variety of toxic manifestations, including fetal death. In order to evaluate the effects of low-dose TCDD on placental function in this study, pregnant Holtzman rats were given a single oral dose of 800 or 1600 ng TCDD/kg body wt or an equivalent volume of vehicle (control) on gestation day (GD) 15 and the results were observed on GD16 and GD20. The number of fetal deaths increased in the animals exposed to TCDD. Although fetal and placental weight did not differ significantly between the control group and the TCDD groups, histological differences from the control rats were clearly observed in the junctional zone (JZ) of the placentas of the TCDD-exposed rats. In the control placenta, glycogen cells occupied the majority of the JZ on GD16, but then decreased in number and almost disappeared by GD20, whereas on GD20 the placenta of the TCDD-exposed rats exhibited a larger area occupied by the glycogen cells and cysts filled with eosinophilic material surrounded by glycogen cells in the JZ than that of the control group. Glycogen assay revealed that the glycogen content of the placentas from the TCDD-exposed rats was higher than in the control rats. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to assess the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3, the two major placental glucose transporter isoforms. On GD20 the level of expression of GLUT1 mRNA in the placentas was not different between the control and TCDD groups, whereas the level of expression of GLUT3 mRNA approximately doubled in both the 800 and 1600 ng/kg TCDD groups. GLUT3 mRNA expression was restricted to the labyrinth zone of placenta, where zone-specific expression of mRNA arylhydrocarbon receptor and induction of cytochrome P450 1A1 mRNA by TCDD were observed, and none was detected in the JZ. These results, including the increase of glycogen content and GLUT3 mRNA level in TCDD-exposed placentas, provide the first evidence of alteration of glucose kinetics in the placenta by TCDD.
We report germline loss-of-function mutations in SPRED1 in a newly identified autosomal dominant human disorder. SPRED1 is a member of the SPROUTY/SPRED family of proteins that act as negative regulators of RAS->RAF interaction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The clinical features of the reported disorder resemble those of neurofibromatosis type 1 and consist of multiple café-au-lait spots, axillary freckling and macrocephaly. Melanocytes from a café-au-lait spot showed, in addition to the germline SPRED1 mutation, an acquired somatic mutation in the wild-type SPRED1 allele, indicating that complete SPRED1 inactivation is needed to generate a café-au-lait spot in this syndrome. This disorder is yet another member of the recently characterized group of phenotypically overlapping syndromes caused by mutations in the genes encoding key components of the RAS-MAPK pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mutations in the SPRY (SPROUTY)/SPRED family of genes in human disease.
The effects of N-[8-amino-1(S)-carboxyoctyl]-L-alanyl-L-proline (AB-47, CAS 120008-53-9), an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the central nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular, autonomic systems, isolated smooth muscles and other functions were investigated in various experimental animals. AB-47 had no effect on central nervous, autonomic systems and isolated smooth muscles. AB-47 (10 and 30 micrograms/kg i.v.) significantly lowered femoral blood pressure without affecting respiration and heart rate in anesthetized rats. However, AB-47 had no effect on the contractile tension of mammalian isolated atrium and aorta. AB-47 had no effect on gastrointestinal transit in mice. Very slight injury of gastric mucosa was observed 4 h after the oral administration of AB-47 in rats but AB-47 did not damage the small intestinal mucosa. AB-47 had no effect on the contraction of rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation induced by electrical stimulation. AB-47 did not affect the incidence of acetic acid-induces writhings. AB-47 potentiated carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. The potentiation of edema may be due to an accumulation of bradykinin induced by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), because ACE is the identical enzyme with kinase II. The pretreatment of AB-47 for 7 days (1, 3, 10 mg/kg/d p.o.) inhibited the cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol (isoprenaline). This result suggests that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system directly or indirectly participates in the cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
A case illustrating the worsening of a patient's schizophrenic symptoms following haloperidol dosage increases in presented. This case is remarkable in that few cases of psychotic exacerbation with haloperidol dosage increases have been reported in the world literature. The possibility exists that, like certain tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptic medication may possess a "therapeutic window,". The concept of a therapeutic window and its relationship to the phenomenon of psychotic exacerbation is reviewed. In evaluating this condition, the clinician should consider other causes of psychotic exacerbation, such as akathisia and anticholinergic psychosis.
We have analyzed transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiles of hepatoma cells cultivated inside a microfluidic biochip with or without acetaminophen (APAP). Without APAP, the results show an adaptive cellular response to the microfluidic environment, leading to the induction of anti-oxidative stress and cytoprotective pathways. In presence of APAP, calcium homeostasis perturbation, lipid peroxidation and cell death are observed. These effects can be attributed to APAP metabolism into its highly reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). That toxicity pathway was confirmed by the detection of GSH-APAP, the large production of 2-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxybutyrate, and methionine, cystine, and histidine consumption in the treated biochips. Those metabolites have been reported as specific biomarkers of hepatotoxicity and glutathione depletion in the literature. In addition, the integration of the metabolomic, transcriptomic and proteomic collected profiles allowed a more complete reconstruction of the APAP injury pathways. To our knowledge, this work is the first example of a global integration of microfluidic biochip data in toxicity assessment. Our results demonstrate the potential of that new approach to predictive toxicology.
We carried out a genome-wide association study (318,237 SNPs) for insulin resistance and related phenotypes in 2,684 Indian Asians, with further testing in 11,955 individuals of Indian Asian or European ancestry. We found associations of rs12970134 near MC4R with waist circumference (P = 1.7 x 10(-9)) and, independently, with insulin resistance. Homozygotes for the risk allele of rs12970134 have approximately 2 cm increased waist circumference. Common genetic variation near MC4R is associated with risk of adiposity and insulin resistance.
Ranitidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, has been associated with hematotoxicity. The mechanism(s) underlying the toxicity is not well understood. The authors studied the mechanism of anemia in a patient with ranitidine associated anemia and thrombocytopenia. Clinical evaluation suggested drug-induced Coombs' positive reticulocytopenic hemolysis. In vitro, with the patient off ranitidine, the authors were able to induce Coombs' positivity by incubating patient's red cells with ranitidine and his serum. This process was inhibited by prior exposure of his red cells to histamine. In vitro studies using clonal assays for hematopoietic progenitors revealed that while the patient's serum or ranitidine alone did not affect the patient's or normal bone marrow hematopoiesis, the simultaneous presence of both agents significantly suppressed both patient's and normal erythroid progenitor (BFU-E) colony development. This suppressive effect was prevented by the prior exposure of marrow to histamine and was not observed when the patient's serum was heat inactivated. These studies suggest that the anemia may have resulted from complement-dependent autoimmune destruction/inhibition of progenitor/mature erythroid cells by a process critically dependent on the presence of ranitidine and possibly acting at or near the histamine receptor.
Early in the monitoring of amiodarone it was evident that neurological events were unexpectedly frequent. A survey was then undertaken to measure the frequency of such events and to gain some impression of their clinical importance. The method of survey was the completion of questionnaires by doctors when patients were being reviewed. There was a 63.6% response rate and questionnaires were evaluated for 408 patients. There were 192 events assessed as being adverse reactions from a group of nine types of neurological events in 112 patients. Paraesthesiae, ataxia, vertigo and tremor were the most common (7-9%). The overall rate of neurological reactions was 27.5%. The individual reactions are examined as are dose relationships.
Although well-defined clinically and electrocardiographically, Acquired Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) remains elusive from a pathophysiologic point of view. An increasingly accepted hypothesis is that it represents an attenuated form of Congenital Long QT Syndrome. To test this hypothesis further, we investigated patients with Acquired LQTS, using various investigations that are known to give information in patients with Congenital LQTS.
All the investigations were performed in patients with a history of Acquired Long QT Syndrome, defined by marked transient QT lengthening (QT>600 ms) and/or torsades de pointes. Measurement of the QT interval dispersion, the interlead difference for the QT interval on a 12-lead ECG, was performed in 18 patients and compared with 18 controls, matched for age and sex. To assess sympathetic myocardial innervation, I-123 Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (I-123-MIBG) scintigraphy was performed in 12 patients, together with Thallium scintigraphy, to rule out abnormal myocardial perfusion. Time-frequency analysis of a high-resolution ECG using a wavelet technique, was made for nine patients and compared with 38 healthy controls. Finally, genetic studies were performed prospectively in 16 consecutive patients, to look for HERG, KCNE1, KCNE2 and KCNQ1 mutations. The functional profile of a mutated HERG protein was performed using the patch-clamp technique.
Compared with the control group, a significant increase in QT dispersion was observed in the patients with a history of Acquired LQTS (55+/-15 vs. 33+/-9 ms, P<0.001). In another group of patients with Acquired LQTS, 123 I-MIBG tomoscintigraphy demonstrated a decrease in the sympathetic myocardial innervation. Time--frequency analysis using wavelet transform, demonstrated an abnormal frequency content within the QRS complexes, in the patients with Acquired LQTS, similar to that found in Congenital LQTS patients. Molecular screening in 16 consecutive patients, identified one patient with a missense mutation on HERG, one of the LQTS genes. Expression of the mutated HERG protein led to altered K(+) channel function.
Our results suggest that Acquired and Congenital Long QT Syndromes have some common features. They allow the mechanism of the clinical heterogeneity, found in both syndromes, to be understood. Further multi-facet approaches are needed to decipher the complex interplay between the main determinants of these arrhythmogenic diseases.
To identify common variants influencing body mass index (BMI), we analyzed genome-wide association data from 16,876 individuals of European descent. After previously reported variants in FTO, the strongest association signal (rs17782313, P = 2.9 x 10(-6)) mapped 188 kb downstream of MC4R (melanocortin-4 receptor), mutations of which are the leading cause of monogenic severe childhood-onset obesity. We confirmed the BMI association in 60,352 adults (per-allele effect = 0.05 Z-score units; P = 2.8 x 10(-15)) and 5,988 children aged 7-11 (0.13 Z-score units; P = 1.5 x 10(-8)). In case-control analyses (n = 10,583), the odds for severe childhood obesity reached 1.30 (P = 8.0 x 10(-11)). Furthermore, we observed overtransmission of the risk allele to obese offspring in 660 families (P (pedigree disequilibrium test average; PDT-avg) = 2.4 x 10(-4)). The SNP location and patterns of phenotypic associations are consistent with effects mediated through altered MC4R function. Our findings establish that common variants near MC4R influence fat mass, weight and obesity risk at the population level and reinforce the need for large-scale data integration to identify variants influencing continuous biomedical traits.
Sprouty genes encode intracellular regulators of receptor tyrosine kinases that function in a variety of developmental events. Although mice carrying null mutations in Sprouty genes exhibit craniofacial anomalies, the precise role of these regulatory proteins in facial development remains unclear. Here, we show that overexpression of spry2 at the initiation of craniofacial development results in a dramatic arrest in outgrowth of the facial prominences. Although endogenous spry2 and fibroblast growth factor 8 (fgf8) are coexpressed throughout much of craniofacial development, overexpression of spry2 did not alter the spatiotemporal patterns of fgf target gene expression. The morphological consequences of spry2 overexpression were specific: all of the facial prominences were truncated, but despite this gross malformation, the programs of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis were not impaired. Collectively, these data suggest that Sprouty2 plays a role in the outgrowth of facial prominences independent of canonical Fgf signaling.
Fluorescein is a fluorochrome dye occasionally administered by intrathecal injection to identify and localize cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Although generally considered to be a benign intervention, intrathecal administration of fluorescein has resulted in adverse events. We report a case of status epilepticus after intrathecal administration of fluorescein. Anesthesia providers should be aware of complications associated with intrathecal fluorescein use and be prepared to manage neurologic complications during the perioperative period.
An epidural anesthetic was planned for a 75-year-old man scheduled for elective femoral-popliteal bypass grafting.
Severe and persistent back pain and posterior thigh muscle spasm abruptly began 10 minutes after epidural injection of mepivacaine.
Signs of impending or evolving neurologic injury completely resolved shortly thereafter.
The worst case scenarios, epidural hematoma and unintentional epidural injection of an irritant, are discussed along with other differential diagnoses. The literature is reviewed to gain insight into this unusual clinical presentation.
Patients with early-stage myeloma are typically observed without therapy until symptomatic disease occurs. However, they are at high risk of progression to symptomatic myeloma, with a median time to progression of approximately 1-2 years. We report the final results of a phase II trial of thalidomide as initial therapy for early-stage multiple myeloma in an attempt to delay progression to symptomatic disease. In total, 31 patients with smoldering or indolent multiple myeloma were studied at the Mayo Clinic. Two patients were deemed ineligible because they were found to have received prior therapy for myeloma, and were excluded from analyses except for toxicity. Thalidomide was initiated at a starting dose of 200 mg/day. Patients were followed-up monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Of the 29 eligible patients, 10 (34%) had a partial response to therapy with at least 50% or greater reduction in serum and urine monoclonal (M) protein. When minor responses (25-49% decrease in M protein) were included, the response rate was 66%. Three patients had progressive disease while on therapy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival are 80% at 1 year and 63% at 2 years. Major grade 3-4 toxicities included two patients with somnolence and one patient each with neuropathy, deep-vein thrombosis, hearing loss, weakness, sinus bradycardia, and edema. Thalidomide has significant activity in early-stage myeloma and has the potential to delay progression to symptomatic disease. This approach must be further tested in randomized trials.
