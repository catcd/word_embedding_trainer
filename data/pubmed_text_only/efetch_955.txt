HER2 is a clinically important tumor marker in breast cancer; however, there is controversy regarding which method reliably measures HER2 status. We compared three HER2 laboratory methods: immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy in node-positive breast cancer patients.
This is a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study, using 524 tumor blocks collected from breast cancer patients registered to clinical trial CALGB 8541. IHC employed CB11 and AO-11-854 monoclonal antibodies; FISH used PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe kit; PCR utilized differential PCR (D-PCR) methodology.
Cases HER2 positive by IHC, FISH and D-PCR were 24%, 17%, and 18%, respectively. FISH and IHC were clearly related (kappa = 64.8%). All three methods demonstrated a similar relationship for DFS and OS. By any method, for patients with HER2-negative tumors, there was little or no effect of dose of adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy. For patients with HER2-positive tumors, all three methods predicted a benefit from dose-intense (high-dose) compared with low- or moderate-dose adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy.
FISH is a reliable method to predict clinical outcome following adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy for stage II breast cancer patients. There is a moderate level of concordance among the three methods (IHC, FISH, PCR). None of the methods is clearly superior. Although IHC-positive/FISH-positive tumors yielded the greatest interaction with dose of therapy in predicting outcome, no combination of assays tested was statistically superior.
Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are immunosuppressive drugs that are used widely to prevent rejection of transplanted organs and to treat autoimmune disease. Hypertension and renal tubule dysfunction, including hyperkalemia, hypercalciuria and acidosis, often complicate their use. These side effects resemble familial hyperkalemic hypertension, a genetic disease characterized by overactivity of the renal sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) and caused by mutations in genes encoding WNK kinases. We hypothesized that CNIs induce hypertension by stimulating NCC. In wild-type mice, the CNI tacrolimus caused salt-sensitive hypertension and increased the abundance of phosphorylated NCC and the NCC-regulatory kinases WNK3, WNK4 and SPAK. We demonstrated the functional importance of NCC in this response by showing that tacrolimus did not affect blood pressure in NCC-knockout mice, whereas the hypertensive response to tacrolimus was exaggerated in mice overexpressing NCC. Moreover, hydrochlorothiazide, an NCC-blocking drug, reversed tacrolimus-induced hypertension. These observations were extended to humans by showing that kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus had a greater fractional chloride excretion in response to bendroflumethiazide, another NCC-blocking drug, than individuals not treated with tacrolimus; renal NCC abundance was also greater. Together, these findings indicate that tacrolimus-induced chronic hypertension is mediated largely by NCC activation, and suggest that inexpensive and well-tolerated thiazide diuretics may be especially effective in preventing the complications of CNI treatment.
We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of intrathecal sufentanil with a low dose of local anesthetic in an attempt to prolong analgesia in labor. Fifty-two patients received one of the following intrathecal study solutions: 2.5 mg of bupivacaine; 10 micrograms of sufentanil; or 2.5 mg of bupivacaine plus 10 micrograms of sufentanil. The mean duration of analgesia (min +/- SD) was significantly different among all three groups: 70 +/- 34 min for bupivacaine, 114 +/- 26 min for sufentanil, and 148 +/- 27 min for bupivacaine-sufentanil (P < 0.001). Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain were significantly higher in the bupivacaine group compared to both the sufentanil group and the bupivacaine-sufentanil group (P < 0.02), and were significantly higher in the sufentanil group compared to bupivacaine-sufentanil at 75 min postinjection and beyond (P < 0.02). Hypotension was not observed in the sufentanil group but occurred transiently in the other two groups (P = 0.09). There was no evidence of motor blockade, excessive somnolence, fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities, or postdural puncture headache (PDPH) in any of the patients. The addition of 2.5 mg of bupivacaine to 10 micrograms of intrathecal sufentanil significantly prolonged labor analgesia without adverse maternal or fetal effects.
Periodontitis is one of the most widespread infectious inflammatory diseases, characterized by chronic bacterial infection of the supporting structures of the teeth, leading to tooth loss in adults. Mangiferin, a naturally occurring glucosylxanthone, has recently gained great attention, owing to potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, and antitumor properties. These studies confirm that mangiferin, exert excellent antioxidant effect and act rapidly in the face of oxidative stress. Meanwhile, mangiferin could significantly inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Especially, treated with mangiferin, the alveolar bone loss of rats with experimental periodontitis has been remarkably reduced. Given these bioactivity exhibited for mangiferin, we hypothesized that mangiferin may play an efficient role in therapy of periodontitis, which may offer new therapeutic options for the management of patients with periodontitis.
Gefitinib is one of the small molecule inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR TKIs). Clinical trials have demonstrated it is effective for treatment of a subset of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib has been generally considered to be a relatively safe agent. Besides a small proportion of fatal interstitial pneumonia, the common adverse drug reactions of gefitinib include diarrhea and skin rash, which are generally mild and reversible. Herein, we report the first two cases of brain metastasis hemorrhage that might be involved with the use of gefitinib.
Two patients with brain metastasis from NSCLC developed brain hemorrhage after gefitinib therapy. The hemorrhage in one case occurred one month after gefitinib combined with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and in the another case hemorrhage developed slowly within brain metastases eight months post gefitinib monotherapy for diffuse pulmonary metastasis from a lung cancer undergone surgical removal previously.
We speculate brain hemorrhage could be one of the adverse drug reactions of gefitinib treatment for NSCLC and suggest clinicians be aware of this possible rare entity. More data are needed to confirm our findings, especially when gefitinib is used in the settings of brain metastases from NSCLC or other origins.
Epigenetic dysregulation is an emerging hallmark of cancers. We developed a high-information-content mass spectrometry approach to profile global histone modifications in human cancers. When applied to 115 lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, this approach identified distinct molecular chromatin signatures. One signature was characterized by increased histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36) dimethylation, exhibited by several lines harboring translocations in NSD2, which encodes a methyltransferase. A previously unknown NSD2 p.Glu1099Lys (p.E1099K) variant was identified in nontranslocated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines sharing this signature. Ectopic expression of the variant induced a chromatin signature characteristic of NSD2 hyperactivation and promoted transformation. NSD2 knockdown selectively inhibited the proliferation of NSD2-mutant lines and impaired the in vivo growth of an NSD2-mutant ALL xenograft. Sequencing analysis of >1,000 pediatric cancer genomes identified the NSD2 p.E1099K alteration in 14% of t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1-containing ALLs. These findings identify NSD2 as a potential therapeutic target for pediatric ALL and provide a general framework for the functional annotation of cancer epigenomes.
We investigated whether pravastatin ameliorates renal damage induced by cisplatin (CP). Forty-three male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: rats treated with a control diet for 19 days and saline injection on day 14 (group1), group 1 with pravastatin treatment with 19 days (group 2), group 1 with CP injection on day 14 (group 3), and group 2 with CP injection (group 4). Renal function and serum lipids, renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mRNA expression and activity, and kidney triglyceride (TG) concentrations were measured. Histology was evaluated by light microscopy with immunohistochemistry for p53, p53-upregulated modulation of apoptosis (PUMA), and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. CP induced renal tubular damage with a higher MDA level, increased PUMA expression, p53- and TUNEL-positive cells counts, elevation of serum lipids, and decreased GSH level, GPx mRNA expression, and activity. Pravastatin partially ameliorated CP-induced renal injury, based on suppression of the renal MDA and TG levels, decreased p53 expression, and apoptosis in CP-treated rats. These findings suggest that pravastatin has a partial protective effect against CP nephrotoxicity via antioxidant activity as well as attenuation of the p53 response, and lipid-lowering effects.
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the absence of paternally expressed, maternally silenced genes at 15q11-q13. We report four individuals with truncating mutations on the paternal allele of MAGEL2, a gene within the PWS domain. The first subject was ascertained by whole-genome sequencing analysis for PWS features. Three additional subjects were identified by reviewing the results of exome sequencing of 1,248 cases in a clinical laboratory. All four subjects had autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and a varying degree of clinical and behavioral features of PWS. These findings suggest that MAGEL2 is a new gene causing complex ASD and that MAGEL2 loss of function can contribute to several aspects of the PWS phenotype.
Liver toxicity represents an important healthcare issue because it causes significant morbidity and mortality and can be difficult to predict before symptoms appear owing to drug therapy or exposure to toxicants. Using metabolomic techniques, we discovered common biomarkers for the prediction of hepatotoxicity in rat urine using mass spectrometry. For this purpose, liver toxicity was induced by 5 days of oral administration of carbon tetrachloride (1 ml kg(-1) per day), acetaminophen (1000 mg kg(-1) per day) and methotrexate (50 mg kg(-1) per day). Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and histopathology in liver tissue were then checked to demonstrate liver toxicity. Global metabolic profiling with UPLC-TOF-MS (ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), multivariate analysis (partial least square-discriminant analysis, hierarchical analysis) and database searching were performed to discover common biomarkers for liver toxicity induced by these three compounds. Urinary concentrations of the newly discovered biomarkers were then quantified to confirm them as biomarkers of hepatotoxicity with targeted metabolic profiling using GC (gas chromatography)-MS and CE (capillary electrophoresis)-MS. In the results, steroids, amino acids and bile acids were metabolically changed between the control and drug-treated groups in global metabolic profiling; 11β-hydroxyandrosterone, epiandrosterone, estrone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, dl-ornithine, 3-methylhistidine, cholic acid and lithocholic acid were selected as liver toxicity biomarkers after performing targeted metabolic profiling. In conclusion, we discovered metabolite biomarkers belonging to three different metabolic pathways to check for liver toxicity with mass spectrometry from a metabolomics study that could be used to evaluate hepatotoxicity induced by drugs or other toxic compounds.
Using the ImmunoChip custom genotyping array, we analyzed 14,498 subjects with multiple sclerosis and 24,091 healthy controls for 161,311 autosomal variants and identified 135 potentially associated regions (P < 1.0 × 10(-4)). In a replication phase, we combined these data with previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from an independent 14,802 subjects with multiple sclerosis and 26,703 healthy controls. In these 80,094 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 48 new susceptibility variants (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)), 3 of which we found after conditioning on previously identified variants. Thus, there are now 110 established multiple sclerosis risk variants at 103 discrete loci outside of the major histocompatibility complex. With high-resolution Bayesian fine mapping, we identified five regions where one variant accounted for more than 50% of the posterior probability of association. This study enhances the catalog of multiple sclerosis risk variants and illustrates the value of fine mapping in the resolution of GWAS signals.
Antihistamines are believed to reduce the sneezing and rhinorrhea associated with allergic rhinitis, primarily by competitive antagonism of histamine for H1 cellular receptors, but additional mechanisms of action may contribute to their clinical efficacy. To improve our understanding of H1 antihistamine action, we studied the effects of pretreatment with terfenadine, cetirizine, ketotifen, azatadine, diphenhydramine, and azelastine on increases in vascular permeability, mast cell activation, and sneezing induced by nasal challenge with antigen. All studied antihistamines reduced sneezing, indicating that they all effectively antagonize histamine after its release. In addition, terfenadine and topically administered azatadine blocked the release of histamine. Studies with cetirizine and azelastine revealed that these antihistamines significantly reduced sulfidopeptide leukotriene levels. Terfenadine and azelastine also reduced kinin production. These results confirm that antihistamines are effective in reducing sneezing and, in some cases, vascular permeability. The findings of these studies also illustrate that the various antihistamines have multiple and different mechanisms of action that may have implications for their clinical uses.
Surfactant protein A (SP-A) functions in homeostasis of lung surfactant and in innate immunity. SP-A is secreted by the fetal lung into amniotic fluid. Additionally it has been detected in gestational tissues. We propose that SP-A influences intrauterine inflammation that is commonly associated with preterm birth, the main underlying cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. We used our previously established mouse model of LPS-induced preterm birth of live-born pups to investigate the role of SP-A in preterm birth. Mice overexpressing rat SP-A (rSP-A) under the control of human SP-C promoter were used. Cytokine concentrations in maternal and fetal serum and in amniotic fluid and mRNA levels of several inflammatory mediators in lungs and in intrauterine tissues were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array and RNase Protection Assay, respectively. Higher levels of SP-A mRNA were observed in fetal lungs and intrauterine tissues of rSP-A mice compared with wild-type. Using Western blot we detected excess of SP-A protein in fetal lung and in amniotic fluid of rSP-A animals. Despite some differences in the basal levels of TNF-α and IL-10 between rSP-A and wild-type animals, there were no differences in the duration of pregnancy. However, the levels of TNF-α, IL-10 and some other inflammatory mediators in intrauterine tissues and in amniotic fluid differed significantly between the mouse lines after maternal LPS given at 17dpc. We conclude that SP-A modulates the levels of intrauterine inflammatory mediators involved in preterm birth and may contribute to inflammatory processes related to spontaneous preterm labor.
Historical changes in forensic psychiatric evaluation on criminal responsibility and proceedings in psychopathological findings of amphetamine psychosis are reviewed at first. The classification of amphetamine related mental disorders are proposed in 6 types. Among them, the clinical characteristics and psychopathological features of "Anxiety-situational reaction type" (Fukushima) are described. According to some reasonable grounds, offenders diagnosed as anxiety-situational reaction type should be evaluated as diminished responsibility in place of irresponsibility. Finally, two cases of murder committed under the influence of amphetamine, are reported in detail.
Rosiglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist that has been shown to induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in a variety of human cancers including thyroid cancer.
Ten patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were enrolled in an open-label, phase II trial of oral rosiglitazone treatment (4 mg daily for 1 week, then 8 mg daily for 7 weeks). The levels of PPARgamma receptor mRNA and protein expression were determined in the patient's neoplasm.
Of 10 patients, 4 had positive radioiodine scans after rosiglitazone therapy with uptake in the neck in 3 patients and in the pelvis in 1 patient. After treatment, the serum thyroglobulin level decreased in 2 patients, increased in 5 patients, and was stable in 3 patients. No patient developed clinically important toxicity associated with rosiglitazone treatment. We found no relationship in the level of PPARgamma mRNA and protein expression in patients who had radioiodine uptake compared with those who did not.
Our findings suggest that rosiglitazone treatment may induce radioiodine uptake in some patients with thyroglobulin-positive and radioiodine-negative differentiated thyroid cancer. We found no relationship between the expression level of the PPARgamma mRNA and protein in the neoplasm and radioiodine uptake status after rosiglitazone therapy, questioning the potential pathway of effect.
We sought to determine the contemporary frequency of seizures, and the associated cardiovascular changes, resulting from local anesthetic-induced seizures in all patients undergoing brachial plexus, epidural, and caudal regional anesthetics. We investigated the following variables: development and treatment of seizure or cardiac arrest during the regional anesthetic, type of anesthetic (including local anesthetic used), gender, age, ASA physical status class and type of operation (elective or emergent). In addition, each patient who experienced a seizure underwent retrospective review of the acute event to determine the arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes accompanying the seizure, as well as details of the regional block technique. There was a significant difference between the rate of seizure development between epidural, brachia, and caudal anesthetics, with caudal > brachial > epidural. A significant difference was also noted in the rate of seizure development within types of brachial block, with supraclavicular and interscalene > axillary. No adverse cardiovascular, pulmonary or nervous system events were associated with any of the seizures, including the 16 patients who received bupivacaine blocks. The frequency of local anesthetic-induced seizures stratified by block type has a wide range, and cardiovascular collapse after bupivacaine-associated seizure has a low incidence.
To investigate whether local anesthetic neurotoxicity results from sodium channel blockade, we compared the effects of intrathecally administered lidocaine, bupivacaine, and tetrodotoxin (TTX), the latter a highly selective sodium channel blocker, on sensory function and spinal cord morphology in a rat model. First, to determine relative anesthetic potency, 25 rats implanted with intrathecal catheters were subjected to infusions of lidocaine (n = 8), bupivacaine (n = 8), or TTX (n = 9). The three drugs produced parallel dose-effect curves that differed significantly from one another: the EC50 values for lidocaine, bupivacaine, and TTX were 28.2 mM (0.66%), 6.6 mM (0.19%), and 462 nM, respectively. Twenty-five additional rats were then given intrathecal lidocaine (n = 8), bupivacaine (n = 8), or TTX (n = 9) at concentrations 10 times the calculated EC50 for sensory block. Lidocaine and bupivacaine induced persistent sensory impairment, whereas TTX did not. Finally, 28 rats were given either intrathecal bupivacaine (n = 10) or TTX (n = 9) at 10 times the EC50, or normal saline (n = 9). Significant sensory impairment again occurred after infusion of bupivacaine, but not after infusion of TTX or saline. Neuropathologic evaluation revealed moderate to severe nerve root injury in bupivacaine-treated animals; histologic changes in TTX- and saline-treated animals were minimal, similar, and restricted to the area adjacent to the catheter. These results indicate that local anesthetic neurotoxicity does not result from blockade of the sodium channel, and suggest that development of a safer anesthetic is a realistic goal.
Mounting evidence suggests copper may influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease by reducing clearance of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) from the brain. Previous experiments show that addition of only 0.12 PPM copper (one-tenth the Environmental Protection Agency Human consumption limits) to distilled water was sufficient to precipitate the accumulation of Abeta in the brains of cholesterol-fed rabbits (1). Here we report that addition of copper to the drinking water of spontaneously hypercholesterolemic Watanabe rabbits, cholesterol-fed beagles and rabbits, PS1/APP transgenic mice produced significantly enhanced brain levels of Abeta. In contrast to the effects of copper, we found that aluminum- or zinc-ion-supplemented distilled water did not have a significant effect on brain Ab accumulation in cholesterol-fed rabbits. We also report that administration of distilled water produced a reduction in the expected accumulation of Ab in three separate animal models. Collectively, these data suggest that water quality may have a significant influence on disease progression and Ab neuropathology in AD.
Capecitabine is a relatively new oral fluoropyrimidine currently licensed for the treatment of colorectal and breast cancer.
It has the advantage of oral administration with good tolerability and comparable activity to intravenous 5-fluorouracil. Central neurotoxicity has been described in 5-fluorouracil-treated patients but there is little data regarding capecitabine. We report here a case of reversible capecitabine-induced encephalopathy progressing to coma.
Literature on fluoropyrimidine-related neurotoxicity will also be reviewed and possible mechanisms of the drug or its metabolites crossing the blood-brain barrier will be discussed.
This study has compared the incidences of nausea, vomiting and headache after ondansetron 0.06 mg kg-1 i.v., prochlorperazine 0.2 mg kg-1 i.m. and prochlorperazine 0.1 mg kg-1 i.v. given during induction of general anaesthesia to 282 patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy. The cardiovascular effects of the drugs were similar. After operation, nausea per se and vomiting per se occurred with similar frequency, in between 6% and 11% and 11% and 19%, respectively, in each test group. Nausea and vomiting in the same patient was reduced from 29% to 2% by i.v. ondansetron (P < 0.0005) and to 3% by i.m. prochlorperazine (P < 0.0005), and appeared to be less severe in these groups. Headache was most frequent after i.v. ondansetron (35%: P < 0.05), but occurred with similar frequency after i.m. prochlorperazine (32%) and i.v. prochlorperazine (29%).
Using exome sequencing and a variant prioritization strategy that focuses on loss-of-function variants, we identified biallelic, loss-of-function CEP57 mutations as a cause of constitutional mosaic aneuploidies. CEP57 is a centrosomal protein and is involved in nucleating and stabilizing microtubules. Our findings indicate that these and/or additional functions of CEP57 are crucial for maintaining correct chromosomal number during cell division.
Fourteen male patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, each of whom had been treated with L-DOPA, and in whom additional treatment with oral dopamine agonist (DA) was needed, were followed for a period of one year. Pergolide mesylate (Permax) was given to each patient, and titrated to a total daily dose of 3 mg. All of the patients were taking L-DOPA. The assessments performed before the start of pergolide treatment consisted of neurological examination, unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) III and IV subscales scoring, mini mental state examination (MMSE) scoring, the neuropsychological examination including Zung scale scoring, biochemical and hematological examinations including prolactine serum levels; and a sexological examination during which the patients filled-in the international index of erectile function (IIEF) questionnaire. These examinations were repeated during the control assessments at months 1, 3, 6 and 12. ANOVA, non-parametric Friedmann's ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests were used for the statistical analysis. There were statistically significant differences between the values of UPDRS III motor subscale and all subscales of IIEF when months 0 and 1 were compared with the results obtained at months 3, 6 and 12. Pergolide mesylate, when added to L-DOPA, significantly improved all sexual functions in younger male Parkinsonian patients who were still interested in sexual activities. The treatment with pergolide in these cases might be more beneficial than with short-acting PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafile. Nevertheless, the relationship between pergolide treatment and incidence of restrictive valvular heart disease must be considered.
Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative with multiple clinical uses including the treatment of various infections, acne vulgaris, and rosacea. Numerous adverse events have been reported ranging from minor complaints such as nausea, to serious life-threatening toxicities such as acute renal failure, hepatotoxicity, and systemic lupus erythematosus. We report the case of an 18-year-old female patient who developed minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa after taking minocycline for acne vulgaris. The vasculitis resolved after discontinuation of the minocycline without need for corticosteroids. This case is the eighth biopsy-confirmed case of minocycline-induced polyarteritis nodosa. Although minocycline is an effective medication with a wide variety of clinical uses, clinicians must be aware of its potential side effects including autoimmune-related disorders such as polyarteritis nodosa or systemic lupus erythematosus.
KIF7, the human ortholog of Drosophila Costal2, is a key component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Here we report mutations in KIF7 in individuals with hydrolethalus and acrocallosal syndromes, two multiple malformation disorders with overlapping features that include polydactyly, brain abnormalities and cleft palate. Consistent with a role of KIF7 in Hedgehog signaling, we show deregulation of most GLI transcription factor targets and impaired GLI3 processing in tissues from individuals with KIF7 mutations. KIF7 is also a likely contributor of alleles across the ciliopathy spectrum, as sequencing of a diverse cohort identified several missense mutations detrimental to protein function. In addition, in vivo genetic interaction studies indicated that knockdown of KIF7 could exacerbate the phenotype induced by knockdown of other ciliopathy transcripts. Our data show the role of KIF7 in human primary cilia, especially in the Hedgehog pathway through the regulation of GLI targets, and expand the clinical spectrum of ciliopathies.
Although altered effects of various anesthetics have been demonstrated during pregnancy, published studies have incompletely defined potential pregnancy-induced changes in the central nervous system toxicity of lidocaine. Accordingly, the seizure threshold for lidocaine was measured in three groups of mechanically ventilated rats breathing 70% N2O-30% O2: male (n = 21), nonpregnant female (n = 19), and pregnant female (n = 23). Lidocaine was administered intravenously at a constant rate of 2.3 mg.kg-1.min-1 while the electroencephalogram was monitored continuously. Total doses of lidocaine and the durations of lidocaine infusion necessary to induce seizure activity were similar among groups. Plasma lidocaine concentrations at the onset of electroencephalographic seizure activity were also similar among groups (male = 10.7 +/- 5.5, nonpregnant female = 12.1 +/- 4.9, pregnant female = 10.8 +/- 4.1 micrograms/mL). In a subset of each group, brain lidocaine concentrations at the onset of seizure activity were also measured, and again no differences among groups were observed (male = 17.4 +/- 6.3, nonpregnant female = 16.8 +/- 4.5, pregnant female = 16.7 +/- 4.2 micrograms/100 g wet wt). The authors conclude that there are no pregnancy-specific alterations in either plasma or brain concentration thresholds for central nervous system toxicity of lidocaine in rats.
