To identify some of the genetic factors that contribute to obesity in children of Central European and North African descent, we studied the parental transmission of alleles at the insulin locus to offspring with early-onset obesity. A variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism upstream of the insulin gene (INS) is associated with variations in the expression of INS and the nearby gene encoding insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). We found an excess of paternal transmission of class I VNTR alleles to obese children: children who inherited a class I allele from their father (but not those inheriting it from their mother) had a relative risk of early-onset obesity of 1.8. Due to the frequency of class I alleles in this population, this risk concerns 65-70% of all infants. These results suggest that increased in utero expression of paternal INS or IGF2 due to the class I INS VNTR allele may predispose offspring to postnatal fat deposition.
The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of supplemental chromium picolinate (CrPic) and chromium histidinate (CrHis) on nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB p65) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in diabetic rat brain. Nondiabetic (n = 45) and diabetic (n = 45) male Wistar rats were either not supplemented or supplemented with CrPic or CrHis via drinking water to consume 8 μg elemental chromium (Cr) per day for 12 weeks. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection (40 mg/kg i.p., for 2 weeks) and maintained by high-fat feeding (40 %). Diabetes was associated with increases in cerebral NF-κB and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adducts and decreased in cerebral nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells inhibitor, alpha (IκBα) and Nrf2 levels. Both Cr chelates were effective to decrease levels of NF-κB and 4-HNE protein adducts and to increase levels of IκBα and Nrf2 in the brain of diabetic rats. However, responses of these increases and decreases were more notable when Cr was supplemented as CrHis than as CrPic. In conclusion, Cr may play a protective role in cerebral antioxidant defense system in diabetic subjects via the Nrf2 pathway by reducing inflammation through NF-κB p65 inhibition. Histidinate form of Cr was superior to picolinate form of Cr in reducing NF-κB expression and increasing Nrf2 expression in the brain of diabetic rats.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent endometrial cancer.
Nine patients with recurrent endometrial cancer who had previously received chemotherapy or radiotherapy participated in the study, between May 1999 and August 2001. Paclitaxel was given at a dose of 70 mg/m(2) as a 1-h infusion every week for at least 20 consecutive weeks unless lesions became progressive. Intravenous dexamethasone and cimetidine and oral diphenhydramine were administered 30 min before paclitaxel infusion.
The nine patients received a total of 149 cycles of therapy. No hypersensitivity reactions were elicited. Grade 3 leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia occurred in 22%, 33%, and 33% of the patients, respectively. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was required for two patients and no patients experienced febrile neutropenia. Neurotoxicity was commonly observed. Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy and myalgias were observed in 78% and 11% of the patients, respectively. No grade 3 or higher nonhematological toxicities were observed. Partial responses were seen in six of the nine patients (67%). The median progression-free interval was 8 months (range, 0-12 months) and the median overall survival was 10 months (range, 4-24 months).
Weekly 1-h paclitaxel administration is considered safe and effective as a salvage therapy for recurrent endometrial cancer, with this schedule and delivery making its use more convenient and easier in the outpatient setting. The current results support further evaluation.
In patients with essential hypertension plasma adrenaline concentrations have been found to be higher than in normotensive subjects and this may represent increased adrenergic activity. Adrenaline released into the circulation can be taken up by the sympathetic nerve ending and as it is re-released as a co-transmitter it enhances exocytotic noradrenaline release by stimulating prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors and as a consequence it contributes to postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptor-induced vasoconstriction. Adrenaline may also induce vasoconstriction via post- and extra-junctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors, as shown by a decrease in the forearm blood flow during adrenaline infusions in the postjunctional alpha 1- and beta-blocked forearm vasculature, an effect that could be antagonized by alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade with yohimbine. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor stimulation in platelets showed an increased sensitivity to adrenaline, as determined by sensitivity in counteracting the inhibitor effect of PGI2 on intracellular free calcium concentration in untreated patients with essential hypertension, when compared with treated patients or normotensive subjects. As these effects can be normalized by antihypertensive treatment this suggests that the increased hormone sensitivity may be related to the elevated intracellular free calcium concentration. Thus adrenaline, via pre- and post-junctional adrenoceptors, may contribute to enhanced vascular smooth muscle contraction, which most likely is sensitized by the elevated intracellular calcium concentration.
AMP deaminase (AMPD; EC 3.5.4.6) is encoded by a multigene family in mammals. The AMPD1 gene is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle, where this enzyme is thought to play an important role in energy metabolism. Deficiency of AMPD activity in skeletal muscle is associated with symptoms of a metabolic myopathy. Eleven unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency were studied, and each was shown to be homozygous for a mutant allele characterized by a C----T transition at nucleotide 34 (codon 12 in exon 2) and at nucleotide 143 (codon 48 in exon 3). The C----T transition at codon 12 results in a nonsense mutation predicting a severely truncated AMPD peptide. Consistent with this prediction, no immunoreactive AMPD1 peptide is detectable in skeletal muscle of these patients. This mutant allele is found in 12% of Caucasians and 19% of African-Americans, whereas none of the 106 Japanese subjects surveyed has this mutant allele. We conclude from these studies that this mutant allele is present at a sufficiently high frequency to account for the 2% reported incidence of AMPD deficiency in muscle biopsies. The restricted distribution and high frequency of this doubly mutated allele suggest it arose in a remote ancestor of individuals of Western European descent.
Brief periods of global cerebral ischemia are known to produce characteristic patterns of neuronal injury both in human studies and in experimental animal models. Ischemic damage to vulnerable areas such as the CA1 sector of the hippocampus is thought to result from excitotoxic amino acid neurotransmission. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of a novel sodium channel blocking compound, zonisamide, to reduce neuronal damage by preventing the ischemia-associated accumulation of extracellular glutamate. Using a gerbil model, animals were subjected to 5 min ischemic insults. Both pre- and post-ischemic drug administration (zonisamide 150 mg/kg) were studied. Histological brain sections were prepared using a silver stain at 7 and 28 days post ischemia. The animals sacrificed at 28 days also underwent behavioral testing using a modified Morris water maze. In vivo microdialysis was performed on a separate group of animals in order to determine the patterns of ischemia-induced glutamate accumulation in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus. Pyramidal cell damage scores in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were significantly reduced in animals pre-treated with zonisamide compared to saline-treated controls, both at 7 days (drug pre-treated: 0.812 +/- 0.28, n = 8; controls: 1.625 +/- 0.24, n = 8; *P < 0.05) and 28 (drug pre-treated: 0.833 +/- 0.22, n = 12; controls: 1.955 +/- 0.26, n = 11; **P < 0.01) days post ischemia. However, animals receiving zonisamide post-treatment did not display significant differences from controls. Behavioral studies also showed significant preservation of function in drug-treated animals. Microdialysis studies confirmed a reduction in glutamate release in drug-treated animals compared to saline-treated controls. Our data suggest that zonisamide is effective in reducing neuronal damage by a mechanism involving decreased ischemia-induced extracellular glutamate accumulation and interruption of excitotoxic pathways.
We developed hepatitis C virus (HCV) core-E1-E2 and HCV core transgenic mice on a common genetic background to assess the contribution of HCV structural proteins to hepatocarcinogenesis. Eight-week-old core-E1-E2, core, and nontransgenic mice inbred on the FVBxC57Bl/6 background were treated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and sacrificed at 32 weeks old. Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The effect of viral proteins on apoptosis was evaluated in HepG2 cells in which apoptosis was induced by anti-Fas antibody. HCCs were identified at 32 weeks in the majority of DEN-treated mice from all three groups. The mean size of HCCs was significantly larger in core-E1-E2 transgenic (4.63 +/- 1.48 mm), compared with core transgenic (0.78 +/- 0.26 mm, P = .01), and nontransgenic (1.0 +/- 0.19 mm, P = .002) mice. While there were no differences in proliferation, the apoptotic index in core-E1-E2 transgenic HCCs was significantly lower than those found in core and non-transgenic HCCs. Core-E1-E2 transfected HepG2 cells demonstrated a significantly lower apoptotic index (0.35 +/- 0.11) compared with that of core transfected cells (0.74 +/- 0.07, P = .0103). Analysis of a Fas-induced apoptosis model in HCV transgenic mice confirmed that core-E1-E2 transgenic liver underwent significantly less apoptosis than transgenic tissue expressing core only. In conclusion, HCV core-E1-E2 transgenic mice develop significantly larger tumors than transgenic mice expressing core alone or nontransgenic mice. The accelerated tumor phenotype is attributable to suppression of apoptosis rather than enhanced proliferation. These data implicate HCV E1 and/or E2 in conjunction with core as antiapoptotic, tumor accelerator proteins.
Patients with hypercholesterolemia without vascular disease have an impaired endothelium-dependent (nitric oxide-mediated) vasodilation in coronary and peripheral vascular beds. This study was designed to establish whether hypercholesterolemia (and its reduction) affects also the microcirculation vasomotion during postischemic hyperemia in both calf and forearm. Thirteen male patients, aged 36.2+/-8.5 years, mean +/-SD, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and 10 male control subjects, aged 32.2+/-3.6 years free from vascular lesions were studied. Plasma lipids, hematologic parameters, and limb vasoreactivity were evaluated while the patients were treated only with diet and during therapy with simvastatin. Calf and forearm blood flows were determined by venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography at rest, during reactive hyperemia, and after sublingual isosorbide dinitrate administration. Calf resting flow rate of the hypercholesterolemic patients during and without treatment was similar to that of the controls. Calf resting vascular resistance was greater in the untreated hypercholesterolemic subjects than in the normal controls, but during treatment this difference was abolished. Peak flow during reactive hyperemia and flow debt repayment were lower in the untreated hypercholesterolemic subjects as compared to the controls, but they were normalized following hypocholesterolemic therapy. No differences were observed in forearm blood flow measurements between hypercholesterolemic subjects (without and during therapy) and control subjects. The blood flow and vascular resistance after isosorbide dinitrate were modified in a similar manner in the hypercholesterolemic (without and during therapy) and control subjects at both calf and forearm. Hypercholesterolemia does not affect vasodilation in the forearm as determined by postocclusive reactive hyperemia, while in the calf hypercholesterolemia is associated with higher resting vascular resistance, lower peak flow during reactive hyperemia, and lower flow debt repayment. These abnormalities are corrected by the hypocholesterolemic treatment.
Mutations in myelin genes cause inherited peripheral neuropathies that range in severity from adult-onset Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 to childhood-onset Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. Many myelin gene mutants that cause severe disease, such as those in the myelin protein zero gene (MPZ) and the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22), appear to make aberrant proteins that accumulate primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in Schwann cell death by apoptosis and, subsequently, peripheral neuropathy. We previously showed that curcumin supplementation could abrogate ER retention and aggregation-induced apoptosis associated with neuropathy-causing MPZ mutants. We now show reduced apoptosis after curcumin treatment of cells in tissue culture that express PMP22 mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that oral administration of curcumin partially mitigates the severe neuropathy phenotype of the Trembler-J mouse model in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of curcumin significantly decreases the percentage of apoptotic Schwann cells and results in increased number and size of myelinated axons in sciatic nerves, leading to improved motor performance. Our findings indicate that curcumin treatment is sufficient to relieve the toxic effect of mutant aggregation-induced apoptosis and improves the neuropathologic phenotype in an animal model of human neuropathy, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in selected forms of inherited peripheral neuropathies.
Patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer participated in a double-blind, multicenter trial comparing placebo with misoprostol 100 micrograms administered q.i.d. for up to four weeks in the treatment of duodenal ulcer. Ulcers were examined endoscopically at two weeks and, if not healed, again at four weeks. Acetaminophen was permitted for pain relief. At four weeks, of 286 patients admitted to the study, the cumulative healing rate for the 227 evaluable patients was 64.9% for misoprostol and 47.4% for placebo (P = 0.008). Misoprostol was also significantly superior to placebo in promoting ulcer healing when all patients entering the study (intent-to-treat cohort) were compared (P = 0.018), and in a modified intent-to-treat cohort consisting of all patients whose final endoscopic results were known (P = 0.005). Ulcer symptoms were similar in both treatment groups, and most patients in both groups were pain free at the end of the first two weeks of treatment. Diarrhea was the most frequently reported adverse experience (8.5% for misoprostol and 3.5% for placebo). This symptom was mild and self-limiting in spite of continued use of misoprostol. We conclude that misoprostol 100 micrograms q.i.d. for four weeks is safe and effective in the healing of duodenal ulcers.
Altered biogenic amine metabolism and function are believed to underlie certain of the neuropsychiatric symptoms, e.g., depression, mania, and anxiety, encountered in clinical hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We therefore investigated the activity of the degradative enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and its binding parameters using [3H]Ro 41-1049 (defining MAO-A) and [3H]Ro 19-6327 (Lazabemide; defining MAO-B) in autopsied brain tissue from male cirrhotic patients with HE. The MAO-B parameters in HE patient tissue were not significantly different from those determined for control tissue. In contrast, increases in MAO-A activities in HE patient frontocortical (by approximately 50%) and cerebellar (by approximately 145%) tissues were observed, confirming our previous findings using comparable tissues. Increases in the abundance of the active MAO-A protein were of the same order of magnitude, e.g., in frontal cortex by approximately 85% and in cerebellum by approximately 225%. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction indicated an increase in the level of gene expression (by approximately 155%) and thus offers some of the first evidence of a transcriptional event potentially mediating MAO-A function in human brain tissue. The levels of biogenic amine acid metabolites were increased as expected. As HE patients are most often treated for their hepatic symptoms rather than their neuropsychiatric manifestations, they represent an important "untreated" psychiatric population. The present findings are therefore not only important for our understanding of the pathophysiology of HE but also extremely relevant to our understanding of the pharmacotherapy of other neuropsychiatric disorders in which biogenic amine and MAO-A dysfunction is indicated.
1 Labetalol reduces blood pressure when given by fast or slow intravenous injection. 2 The extent of the reduction in arterial pressure is independent of the rate of injection but the rate of fall of blood pressure can be controlled by varying the rate of injection. There is little effect on heart rate. 3 These observations suggest that labetalol possesses important advantages over other vasodilator hypotensive drugs in current use.
We examined a possible involvement of cyclooxygenase (COX) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) products in hyperalgesia occurring during streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Indomethacin and celecoxib were used as relatively selective inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. NOS inhibitors included: non-specific inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine and L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine preferentially acting on inducible NOS (iNOS) as well as 7-nitroindazole relatively specific inhibitor neuronal NOS (nNOS). The above-mentioned agents, except 7-nitroindazole, suppressed hyperalgesia occurring after administration of STZ. The results of the study suggest participation of COX-1, COX-2 and iNOS, but not nNOS, in transmission of pain stimuli in STZ-induced diabetic hyperalgesia.
The role of bradykinin receptor blockade in the development of neuropathies caused by diabetes mellitus and vincristine was examined. The effects of a potent and selective B(1) receptor antagonist (des-Arg(10)-HOE 140) as well as a specific antagonist of B(2) receptors (HOE 140) were investigated. Both agents significantly decreased hyperalgesia caused otherwise by vincristine. In a diabetic neuropathy model, both agents almost completely suppressed hyperalgesia in the first 10 days of the study. However, from day 11 after administration of streptozotocin, the action of des-Arg(10)-HOE 140 was significantly weaker than that of HOE 140. The results of the study suggest involvement of both B(1) and B(2) receptors in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in the vincristine-induced as well as diabetic neuropathy model.
NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) has been used extensively as a paradigmatic inhibitor of NO synthase and has been shown to cause antinociception in several experimental models. We describe here how L-NAME produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect when injected intraperitoneally in the mouse after acetic acid induced writhings, or intraplantarly in the rat paw pressure hyperalgesia induced by carrageenin or prostaglandin E2. In contrast another NO synthase inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), had no significant effect per se but inhibited L-NAME systemic induced antinociception in mice and local induced antinociception in the rat paw hyperalgesia test. D-NAME had no antinociceptive effect upon carrageenin-induced hyperalgesia. Pretreatment of the paws with two inhibitors of guanylate cyclase, methylene blue (MB) and 1H-:[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-:[4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) abolished the antinociceptive effect of L-NAME. L-Arginine and the cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, MY 5445 significantly enhanced the L-NAME antinociceptive effect. The central antinociceptive effect of L-NAME was blocked by co-administration of L-NMMA, ODQ and MB. The present series of experiments shows that L-NAME, but not L-NMMA, has an antinociceptive effect. It can be suggested that L-NAME causes the antinociceptive effect by stimulation of the arginine/ NO/ cGMP pathway, since the antinociceptive effect of L-NAME can be antagonized by L-NMMA and abolished by the guanylate cyclase inhibitors (MB and ODQ). In addition, the NO synthase substrate, L-arginine and the cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, MY5445 were seen to potentiate the effects of L-NAME. Thus, L-NAME used alone, has limitations as a specific inhibitor of the arginine-NO-cGMP pathway and may therefore be a poor pharmacological tool for use in characterising participation in pathophysiological processes.
The efficacy and safety of optimally titrated once-daily (CD) and twice-daily (SR) diltiazem were compared in 111 patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension [seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 95 mmHg and < or = 114 mmHg] in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo run-in, parallel-group trial. Following a 4 week washout and placebo-controlled run-in period, patients were randomized to receive diltiazem CD 180 mg and matching placebo (n = 54), or diltiazem SR 90 mg bid (n = 57). Total daily doses were titrated from 180 mg to 360 mg to achieve a goal of seated DBP < 90 mmHg during a 6 week titration period. The patients continued to receive their optimal dose for a 6 week follow-up period. Ninety-six (96) patients (diltiazem CD: 47, diltiazem SR: 49) completed the study protocol, with 60% of the diltiazem CD and 55% of the diltiazem SR patients achieving the goal of seated DBP of < 90 mmHg (p = 0.685). Although significant decreases occurred in seated and standing measurements of diastolic and systolic BP and heart rate with treatment in both groups, there were no significant differences between treatment groups. Both medications were well tolerated, with a similar frequency of adverse effects [diltiazem CD: 24/54 (37%) patients; diltiazem SR: 24/57 (42.1%) patients] with the most frequently reported adverse effects being headache and edema.
We investigated the pharmacological effects of N-hexacosanol on diabetic rat detrusor. Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: diabetic rats induced by 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally of streptozotocin treated with N-hexacosanol (0, 2 or 8 mg/kg, subcutaneously every day) and control rats. Bladder function was estimated by functional studies using carbachol and KCl. Contractile response curves to increasing concentrations of carbachol were constructed in the absence and presence of various concentrations of subtype-selective muscarinic antagonists, that is, atropine, pirenzepine, methoctramine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP). The participation levels of muscarinic M(2) and M(3) receptor mRNAs in detrusor were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Treatment with N-hexacosanol did not alter diabetic status of the rats, but significantly improved the diabetes-induced hypercontractility of the rat bladder. Estimations of the pA(2) values for atropine, pirenzepine, methoctramine and 4-DAMP indicate that the carbachol-induced contractile response is mediated through the M(3) receptor subtype in all groups. Furthermore, N-hexacosanol ameliorated the diabetes-induced upregulation of muscarinic M(2) receptor mRNAs in streptozotocin-diabetic rat detrusor. Our data indicate that N-hexacosanol has therapeutic effects on hypercontractility in the diabetic bladder by ameliorating overexpression of muscarinic M(2) and M(3) receptor mRNAs without significant alternations of pharmacological profiles.
Approximately 15% of child-bearing women develop postpartum depression (PPD), and many women with PPD experience anxious symptoms. It has been proposed that PPD is precipitated by the dramatic decline in reproductive hormones that occurs just after childbirth. To examine this hypothesis, ovariectomized female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a hormone-simulated pregnancy (HSP) regimen; during the subsequent hormone withdrawal period, rats were tested in the forced swim test or elevated plus-maze, animal models of depression and anxiety, respectively. The HSP regimen consisted of injections with progesterone and escalating doses of estradiol benzoate for 22 days; control rats received daily vehicle injections. One, two, four or seven days after the last hormone injection, separate groups of rats were tested once on either the forced swim test or the elevated plus-maze. To examine any hormone withdrawal-induced changes in activity levels, spontaneous locomotor activity was measured at the same time points. At 2 and 4 days after the last hormone injection, HSP-treated females displayed significant increases in immobility relative to vehicle-treated females in the forced swim test. Behavior on the elevated plus-maze did not differ between the HSP and control groups at any of the withdrawal time points. There were also no differences in spontaneous locomotor activity between the HSP and control females at any of the withdrawal time points. The results of this study suggest that postpartum hormone withdrawal may contribute to depressive symptoms experienced after giving birth, and that the HSP-hormone withdrawal protocol may provide a useful animal model of PPD.
Studies were performed in 20 patients with symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) to determine the efficacy of bethanidine compared with procainamide in preventing VT induced by programmed electrical stimulation. Before administering bethanidine, 5 to 10 mg/kg, the patients received 15 mg of protriptyline orally 24 and 2 hours before electrophysiologic studies to prevent the orthostatic hypotensive effects of bethanidine. Sustained VT (VT not spontaneously stopping) was induced in 8 and nonsustained VT (10 beats or more, terminating spontaneously) was induced in 4 patients. Bethanidine, 5 mg/kg, protected in 7 patients, and 10 mg/kg protected 1 additional patient. Procainamide, 1,000 and 1,500 mg intravenously, protected 8 of 16 patients. Bethanidine prevented VT induction in 50% of the patients not protected by procainamide. Bethanidine facilitated VT induction in 3 patients, while procainamide facilitated VT induction in 1 patient. Four patients with symptomatic VT have received bethanidine therapy for an average of 11 +/- 1.3 months, without clinical recurrence of their VT. Concomitant administration of protriptyline attenuated the acute hemodynamic changes caused by bethanidine and chronic combined therapy of protriptyline and bethanidine abolished the severe orthostatic changes in blood pressure caused by bethanidine. These studies show that bethanidine is effective in preventing VT induction and, thus, its use may not be restricted only to cases of primary ventricular fibrillation.
Topical treatment of gastric mucosa with capsaicin (cap) increases gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) and protects the mucosa from injury by acidified bile salts. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that this hyperemia related "cytoprotection" is mediated by nitric oxide. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and the glandular stomach (blood supply intact) was chambered between two plastic rings. Animals were divided into four groups. All groups received a 5-min topical saline exposure. Groups 1 and 2 received iv saline or nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 25 mg/kg iv), a specific nitric oxide inhibitor, 5 min prior to baseline treatment, followed by a 15-min preinjury period of saline and a 15-min injury period of 10 mM acidified taurocholate (ATC, pH 1.2). Groups 3 and 4 were treated as above except topical cap (160 microM) was used during the preinjury period. GMBF was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter (ml/min/100 g tissue). Injury was assessed grossly (grade 0-3), histologically (grade 0-3), and by measuring DNA content of a 5-min N-acetylcysteine wash (DNAE). Baseline GMBF of 30 +/- 1.5 significantly decreased to 15 +/- 1.2 in group 1 versus group 2 (P < 0.05). When topical ATC was used GMBF increased to 59 +/- 4.9 and 25 +/- 2.8, respectively. Injury by grade and DNAE was not significantly different between these groups. GMBF during cap exposure was 42 +/- 4 and 22 +/- 2 in groups 3 and 4, respectively. Graded histologic and gross injuries were significantly worse in group 4 compared to group 3 (P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
A 61 year old patient in a severely reduced general condition complaining of epigastric pain was admitted to our emergency room. Because of elevated troponin T and creatine kinase levels and severely reduced left ventricular function as seen in echocardiography as well as negative T-waves in the anterolateral ECG leads we suspected an acute coronary syndrome. The patient underwent coronary angiography after intubation and a coronary artery disease was excluded. The initial therapy included the use of an intraaortic balloon pump, volume and catecholamine administration controlled by a pulmonary artery catheter. Conducting an abdominal ultrasound we detected a mass at the right adrenal gland. The suspected diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed by elevated catecholamine levels in the urine and a CT scan. After recompensation and subsequent administration of phenoxybenzamine a benign pheochromocytoma was resected. A massive catecholamine secretion due to a pheochromocytoma can lead to a cardiogenic shock and multiple organ failure. In patients with recurrent panic attacks and hypertension a pheochromocytoma should be included in the differential diagnosis.
Pancreatic cancer cells have been shown to possess stem-cell-like properties, especially by reactivating embryonic transcription factors involved in tissue differentiation. We therefore investigated if and to what extent developmental genes of the human pancreas are expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and precursor lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and if this correlates or predicts response to treatment and overall survival.
Invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas [UICC pT3pN0 (n = 13) vs. pT3pN1 (n = 25)] and tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [5-fluorouracil (FU)/folic-acid and gemcitabine; UICC ypN0 (n = 7) vs. ypN1 (n = 6)] resected between 1997 and 2003 were characterized histochemically and immunohistochemically [pancreas duodenum homeobox 1 (PDX-1), Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH), Patched (Ptc) and Gli-1]. Gene distribution was compared with morphological patterns of the pancreatic carcinoma and PanIN as well as with peritumorous reactions of normal pancreas.
The overall expression of PDX-1, SHH, Ptc and Gli-1 was low, but showed a distinctive and topographic linkage inside pancreatic carcinomas as well as inside PanINs. Additionally, a topographic and significant association of these markers with nodal status (PDX-1, Ptc, Gli-1), tumor size (PDX-1, Gli-1) and R status (PDX-1) was found. After stratification with the strongest outcome predictor, grading, survival analysis revealed that Ptc expression in grade 2 and PDX-1 expression in grade 3 carcinomas are independent survival factors.
Markers of pancreas development are reexpressed in invasive ductal adenocarcinomas and their expression is essentially associated with general clinical and pathological features such as survival or nodal status.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used extensively in clinical medicine. In spite of their therapeutic utility, however, they are known to cause significant gastrointestinal and renal toxicities, circumstances that limit their use. The side effects produced in these organs have been attributed mainly to the inhibitory effect of these drugs on the activity of cyclooxygenase, a key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis. In addition to this, in the small intestine it is known that reactive oxygen species also contribute to the enteropathy seen in response to these drugs. In the kidney, however, there is little information whether other mechanisms contribute to the renal toxicity. This study was designed to look at the possible biochemical mechanisms involved in indomethacin-induced renal damage. Rats fasted overnight were dosed with indomethacin (20 mg/kg) by gavage and sacrificed 24 hr later. Histology of the kidney showed abnormalities in the mitochondria in the proximal tubules. Evidence of oxidative stress was found in the kidney associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neutrophil infiltration. The lipid composition in the mitochondria was also altered. Such effects were abolished by the prior administration of arginine, a donor of nitric oxide. This study, thus, suggests that one of the mechanisms by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce renal damage is through oxygen free radicals possibly generated by activated neutrophils and mitochondrial dysfunction.
Since our initial report in 1984 of six patients with AMI temporally related to cocaine use, we have observed 19 additional patients in whom ischemic chest pain syndromes occurred shortly after intranasal or IV use of cocaine or after smoking the drug. Seventeen patients (89 percent) developed non-Q wave infarction and two had Q-wave infarction. One patient manifested angina with striking ST-segment elevation. None of the patients had diabetes or hypertension, and all but one were cigarette smokers. The serum cholesterol level was 162 +/- 7 mg/dl. Four of the five patients who consented to coronary angiographic studies displayed normal coronary arteries, and one showed proximal stenosis of the right coronary artery. The cold pressor test was performed in seven patients; none had angina or ECG changes induced by cold stimulation. We conclude that T-wave infarction is a common form of an acute cardiac event related to cocaine abuse, and its pathogenesis may involve that of the cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm.
