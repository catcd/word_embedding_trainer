Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocarditis occur in many HIV-infected individuals, resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies.
In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods. NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function. In contrast, AZT-treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity.
The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV-positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART-induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.
To document the presentation of 2 cases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) following methadone overdose.
We report 2 cases of acute, bilateral methadone-induced hearing loss that took place on the same night in our emergency department. A 30-year-old male and his 25-year-old wife were found unresponsive in their home after ingesting an unknown, but presumably large, quantity of methadone. Drugs that are typically categorized as ototoxic were ruled out in each patient via rapid in-house urine drug screens as well with a comprehensive analysis via gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Methadone and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were the only drugs found in the toxicology screenings that were common to both patients. The man had a long treatment course that included several days in the intensive care unit. The woman recovered completely and was discharged within a day of admission. The hearing loss in both patients reversed completely within 24 hours.
Several medications are commonly associated with ototoxicity, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antibiotics, loop diuretics, and chemotherapy agents. Although rare, drug-induced SSHL has been documented particularly among intravenous drug abusers after heroin injection. Until now, there has been only one published case report documenting drug-induced SSHL attributed to methadone.
We believe methadone to be the probable cause of SSHL in both patients, because it and THC were the only common drugs found on toxicology screens, a recent case report involved methadone-induced SSHL, and because of the suddenness of the onset and recovery of the patient's hearing coinciding with the time frame of the ingestion. The Naranjo probability scale score revealed that the adverse reaction was probable for each patient.
A 55-year-old white woman received chemotherapy with DTIC after surgery for malignant melanoma (stage I, SSM IV, depth of invasion 12 mm). She died suddenly during the second treatment cycle. Autopsy revealed massive necrosis of the liver and thrombosis of the hepatic veins. The cause of the fatal outcome is attributed to the adverse toxic effects of DTIC.
Recurrent hepatitis B infection after orthotopic liver transplantation remains problematic despite prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (anti-HBs IgG). Recently, famciclovir (an oral nucleoside analog) has been shown to have potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B in vitro as well as in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We present two patients who developed recurrent hepatitis B after orthotopic liver transplantation and were treated with famciclovir, 500 mg t.i.d. Both patients subsequently responded with marked improvement in biochemical liver tests and histology, with subsequent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen. Famciclovir is a useful agent in the treatment of hepatitis B in the liver transplant recipient.
This randomized double-blind study compared the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of intramuscular lornoxicam and tramadol in 76 patients with moderate to unbearable pain following arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using the patella bone-tendon-bone technique. Patients receiving a single dose of lornoxicam 16 mg experienced significantly greater total pain relief than patients receiving tramadol 100 mg over the following 8 hours. Lornoxicam had greater analgesic efficacy than tramadol in patients with moderate baseline pain but was of equivalent efficacy in those with severe/unbearable baseline pain. Fewer patients in the lornoxicam group required rescue medication (58% vs. 77%, respectively). Patients' global impression of efficacy showed lornoxicam to be superior to tramadol with 82% and 49% of patients, respectively, rating treatment as good, very good, or excellent. Following multiple-dose administration of lornoxicam (8 mg tid) or tramadol (100 mg tid) for 3 days, efficacy profiles similar to those following a single dose were obtained. Thus, slightly fewer patients in the lornoxicam group required rescue medication, and patients' global impression of efficacy again favored lornoxicam. Adverse events were reported by 38 of the 76 patients and were mainly mild to moderate in severity. Significantly fewer patients reported one or more adverse events with lornoxicam than with tramadol (14 vs. 24, respectively). Thus, intramuscular lornoxicam offers a useful alternative to tramadol for the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain.
1. In the present work, the effect of adenosine agonists and antagonists on apomorphine-induced penile erection (PE) has been studied. 2. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of the nonselective D1/D2 dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine (0.05-0.5 mg/kg) induced PE in a biphasic manner. The maximum effect was obtained with 0.1 mg/kg of the drug. The response decreased with increasing doses of apomorphine, from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg. 3. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of adenosine agonists 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) decreased the response of apomorphine. Apomorphine-induced PE was increased by low doses (25, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) and decreased by high doses (75, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) of the adenosine antagonist theophylline, respectively. Inhibition of PE induced by NECA and CHA was antagonized by 8-PT pretreatment. 4. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of CHA, NECA, and theophylline produced the same effects as i.p. injections of these agents on PE responses. It is concluded that A-1 and A-2 adenosine receptor activation may inhibit PE induced by dopaminergic mechanism(s), which can be prevented by 8-PT pretreatment.
Left ventricular function was measured after percutaneous nitroglycerin in ten patients with coronary artery disease under double blind random control. The elevation of LVEF after percutaneous nitroglycerin paste (containing 10 mg nitroglycerin) was 8.3% +/- 1.3% (P less than 0.001) at 30 min, 8.5% +/- 1.8% (P less than 0.001) at 60 min, 10.1% +/- 1.8% (P less than 0.001) at 90 min and 8.7% +/- 2.2% (P less than 0.01) at 120 min respectively, but the change of LVEF after nitroglycerin ointment (containing 5 mg nitroglycerin) was not significant. The elevation of ER and RCO after nitroglycerin paste were 0.448 +/- 0.088 (EDV/s) (P less than 0.001), 6.73 +/- 1.47 (EDV/s) (P less than 0.01) at 30 min, 0.376 +/- 0.078 (P less than 0.001), 6.64 +/- 1.36 (P less than 0.001) at 60 min, 0.456 +/- 0.089 (P less than 0.001), 8.02 +/- 2.11 (P less than 0.001) at 90 min and 0.358 +/- 0.076 (P less than 0.01), 6.18 +/- 2.05 (P less than 0.01) respectively. It was demonstrated that percutaneous nitroglycerin paste (10 mg nitroglycerin) can improve the left ventricular function of patients with coronary artery disease.
Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. However, direct evidence of oxidative stress generation in the human failing myocardium has not been obtained. Furthermore, the effect of carvedilol, a vasodilating beta-blocker with antioxidant activity, on oxidative stress in human failing hearts has not been assessed. This study was therefore designed to determine whether levels of lipid peroxides are elevated in myocardia of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and whether carvedilol reduces the lipid peroxidation level. Methods and Results- Endomyocardial biopsy samples obtained from 23 patients with DCM and 13 control subjects with normal cardiac function were studied immunohistochemically for the expression of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)-modified protein, which is a major lipid peroxidation product. Expression of HNE-modified protein was found in all myocardial biopsy samples from patients with DCM. Expression was distinct in the cytosol of cardiac myocytes. Myocardial HNE-modified protein levels in patients with DCM were significantly increased compared with the levels in control subjects (P<0.0001). Endomyocardial biopsy samples from 11 patients with DCM were examined before and after treatment (mean, 9+/-4 months) with carvedilol (5 to 30 mg/d; mean dosage, 22+/-8 mg/d). After treatment with carvedilol, myocardial HNE-modified protein levels decreased by 40% (P<0.005) along with amelioration of heart failure.
Oxidative stress is elevated in myocardia of patients with heart failure. Administration of carvedilol resulted in a decrease in the oxidative stress level together with amelioration of cardiac function.
Oesclim (Laboratoires Fournier, Dijon, France), also known as Esclim or Esclima, is a new estradiol transdermal delivery system (TDS) developed for the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms. This open, randomized, three-way crossover study compared in 24 healthy postmenopausal women the pharmacokinetics of estradiol after a single 4-day application of Oesclim 50, Oesclim 100, and Vivelle 0.05 (CibaGeneva Pharmaceuticals, Summit, NJ; known as Menorest 50 in Europe, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer) on the upper buttock. Serum estradiol concentrations were determined by a validated radioimmunoassay method from samples taken before and during each TDS application. The concentration-time profiles for Vivelle 0.05 and Oesclim 50 were comparable with a similar absorption rate, giving a maximum concentration (Cmax) of 49 and 53 pg/mL above baseline, respectively, followed by a plateau throughout the 96-hour application period. At the end of this period, mean corrected estradiol concentrations were 18 and 19 pg/mL, respectively. The estradiol serum concentrations obtained after an application of Oesclim 100 were approximately twice as high than with Oesclim 50. All products were well tolerated, but skin intolerance was more frequent with Vivelle 0.05 (4 patients; four reports) and Oesclim 100 (3 patients; three reports) than with Oesclim 50 (none). Problems of imperfect adhesion were more than five times as frequent with Vivelle 0.05 (44%) than with Oesclim (8%).
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Despite common emotional symptoms in AD such as anxiety and fear are associated with a more rapid cognitive decline, the pathological mechanisms involved in these behavioral changes remain largely elusive. In this study, we examined the pathological mechanisms of emotional behavior in well-established AD transgenic mice expressing human mutant beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein (APP(Ind) and APP(Sw,Ind)) and tau (3xTg-AD).
We evaluated unconditioned and conditioned fear-induced freezing behavior and spatial memory in APP(Ind), APP(Sw,Ind), and 3xTg-AD transgenic mice. The Abeta and tau pathologies and signaling pathways involved in emotional processing were studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analyses.
The APP(Ind)/APP(Sw,Ind) and 3xTg-AD transgenic mice displayed at early ages enhanced innate and conditioned fear symptoms and spatial memory deficits coinciding with enhanced accumulation of Abeta in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively, of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Similarly, the number of neurons with intraneuronal Abeta40 and Abeta42 was significantly increased in the BLA of human AD brains. Fear responses might reflect an influence of anxiety, because the anxiolytic compounds valproate, diazepam, and buspirone reduced efficiently unconditioned and conditioned fear responses in APP transgenic mice. In addition, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, which is critical for acquisition and consolidation of fear conditioning, was increased in the amygdala of APP transgenic mice after cued conditioning.
We propose a deleterious role of intraneuronal Abeta on amygdala-dependent emotional responses by affecting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway.
Induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) associates with cigarette smoke exposure in many malignancies. Nicotine and its derivative, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), are the two important components in cigarette smoke that contributes to cancer development. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which nicotine or NNK promotes gastric carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. We found that nicotine and NNK significantly enhanced cell proliferation in AGS cells that expressed both alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) and beta-adrenergic receptors. Treatment of cells with alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX, alpha7nAChR antagonist) or propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) blocked NNK-induced COX-2/PGE(2) and cell proliferation, while nicotine-mediated cell growth and COX-2/PGE(2) induction can only be suppressed by propranolol, but not alpha-BTX. Moreover, in contrast to the dependence of growth promoting effect of nicotine on Erk activation, inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) repressed NNK-induced COX-2 upregulation and resulted in suppression of cell growth. In addition, nicotine and NNK mediated COX-2 induction via different receptors to modulate several G1/S transition regulatory proteins and promote gastric cancer cell growth. Selective COX-2 inhibitor (SC-236) caused G1 arrest and abrogated nicotine/NNK-induced cell proliferation. Aberrant expression of cyclin D1 and other G1 regulatory proteins are reversed by blockade of COX-2. These results pointed to the importance of adrenergic and nicotinic receptors in gastric tumor growth through MAPK/COX-2 activation, which may perhaps provide a chemoprevention strategy for cigarette smoke-related gastric carcinogenesis.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is chronically elevated in adipose tissues of obese rodents and humans. Increased levels of TNF-alpha are implicated in the induction of atherogenic adipokines, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI-1) and IL-6, and the inhibition of the anti-atherogenic adipokine, adiponectin. In this study, we investigated the effects of resveratrol on TNF-alpha-induced atherogenic changes of the adipokines in 3T3-L1 cells. Exposure to TNF-alpha for 24 h increased PAI-1 and IL-6 secretion and decreased adiponectin secretion. The mRNA expression of adipokines changed in parallel with mRNA expression. Resveratrol effectively reversed the secretion and mRNA expression of the atherogenic adipokines, PAI-1 and IL-6, induced by TNF-alpha. Decreased secretion levels and mRNA expression of adiponectin by TNF-alpha were also recovered by resveratrol treatment. Our results suggest that resveratrol may improve obesity-induced cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis, by attenuating the TNF-alpha-induced changes of adipokines.
Cytogenetic abnormalities are used to define prognostic subgroups of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with respect to achieving complete remission (CR) and remaining disease free. These prognostic groups for obtaining CR were based on an induction regimen mainly using standard dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) + daunorubicin (DNR). We have reviewed our experience with 122 adult patients with de novo non-M3 AML who were treated with high-dose (HD) Ara-C 3 g/m2 given over 3 h every 12 h for a total of eight doses followed by DNR 60 mg/m2 daily for 2 days. CR was obtained in 80% while 16% had refractory disease and 4% died of sepsis during hypoplasia. CR rate for favorable, intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetic groups were 87%, 79% and 62%, respectively (P = 0.32). High white blood cell count, age, FAB subtype and LDH levels did not adversely affect CR rate. Eighty-five percent of patients achieved CR with one course of treatment and 87% of complete responders were able to receive post remission therapy. High-dose Ara-C/DNR appears to offer an excellent chance of achieving remission for patients with AML including those with poor risk cytogenetics, without an increase in early toxic deaths.
Fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity occurred in an 8-week-old infant girl recovering from surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta. The neonate received 30 minutes of a moderate dose continuous infusion of fentanyl before chest wall rigidity developed. Association of the chest wall rigidity with the fentanyl infusion resulted in the appropriate intervention of narcotic reversal and prevented irreversible hypoxic sequelae. Patients receiving fentanyl, even at moderate doses, are at risk for the development of chest wall rigidity.
Epidemiologic and experimental studies support an association between PM2.5 exposure and insulin resistance (IR). Innate immune cell activation has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of these effects.
We sought to evaluate the role of CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) in PM2.5-mediated inflammation and IR.
Wild-type C57BL/6 and CCR2-/- male mice were fed a high-fat diet and exposed to either concentrated ambient PM2.5 or filtered air for 17 weeks via a whole-body exposure system. We evaluated glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. At euthanasia, blood, spleen, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were collected, and inflammatory cells were measured using flow cytometry. We used standard immunoblots, immunohistochemical methods, and quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to assess pathways of interest involving insulin signaling, inflammation, and lipid and glucose metabolism in various organs. Vascular function was assessed using myography.
PM2.5 exposure resulted in whole-body IR and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in the liver, which was attenuated in CCR2-/- mice by inhibiting SREBP1c-mediated transcriptional programming, decreasing fatty acid uptake, and suppressing p38 MAPK activity. Abnormal phosphorylation levels of AKT, AMPK in VAT, and adipose tissue macrophage content in wild-type mice were not present in CCR2-/- mice. However, the impaired whole-body glucose tolerance and reduced GLUT-4 in skeletal muscle in response to PM2.5 was not corrected by CCR2 deficiency.
PM2.5 mediates IR by regulating VAT inflammation, hepatic lipid metabolism, and glucose utilization in skeletal muscle via both CCR2-dependent and -independent pathways. These findings provide new mechanistic links between air pollution and metabolic abnormalities underlying IR.
Vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) and its analogues are undergoing evaluation as antineoplastic and chemoprevention agents. Because its toxicity and activity are poorly defined, we have completed a phase I trial of retinol. Retinol was administered to 13 cancer patients in daily doses ranging from 100,000 units/m2 to 350,000 units/m2. Neuropsychiatric changes were the earliest dose-limiting symptomatic toxicities, noted in 3 of 5 patients receiving more than 240,000 U/m2 for 3-4 months. Two patients receiving more than 270,000 U/m2 developed hepatomegaly after 3 and 4 months. Liver biopsies were consistent with vitamin A toxicity. Three patients receiving 200,000 U/m2 developed an increase in serum triglycerides concentration. Mild skin and mucous membrane dryness occurred in most patients receiving more than 150,000 U/m2. A mixed response was seen in one patient with melanoma. Because of neuropsychiatric and hepatic toxicity a retinol dose of 200,000 U/m2/day is recommended for future phase II trials.
Epidemiological studies show that exposure to nickel (Ni) compounds is associated with a variety of pulmonary adverse health effects, such as lung inflammation, fibrosis, emphysema and tumours. However, the mechanisms leading to pulmonary toxicity are not yet fully elucidated. In the current study we used Calu-3, a well differentiated human bronchial cell line, to investigate in vitro the effect of Ni in soluble form (NiCl(2)) and in the form of micro-sized Ni particles on the airway epithelium. For this purpose, we evaluated the effect of Ni compounds on the epithelial barrier integrity by monitoring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and on oxidative stress pathways by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and induction of stress-inducible genes. Our results showed that exposure to NiCl(2) and Ni particles resulted in a disruption of the epithelial barrier function observed by alterations in TEER, which occurred prior to the decrease in cell viability. Moreover, Ni compounds induced oxidative stress associated with ROS formation and up-regulation of the stress-inducible genes, Metallothionein 1X (MT1X), Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1), and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γGCS). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the induced effects by Ni compounds can be partially attributed to the increase in Ni ions (Ni(2+)) intracellular levels.
MS-275 and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors currently tested in oncology trials. They have also been found to display potent anti-rheumatic activities in rodent models for RA. However, the anti-rheumatic mechanisms of action remain unknown. The study was carried out with the intent of determining the anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic mechanisms of the HDAC inhibitors.
In this study, the anti-rheumatic mechanisms of MS-275 and SAHA were investigated in several cell culture models.
MS-275 and SAHA inhibited human RA synovial fibroblastic E11 cell proliferation in a non-cytotoxic manner. The anti-proliferative activities were associated with G(0)/G(1) phase arrest and induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. In addition, MS-275 and SAHA suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-kappaB p65 nuclear accumulation, IL-6, IL-18 and nitric oxide (NO) secretion as well as down-regulated pro-angiogenic VEGF and MMP-2 and MMP-9 production in E11 cells at sub-micromolar levels. At similar concentrations, MS-275 and SAHA suppressed LPS-induced NF-kappaB p65 nuclear accumulation and IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-alpha secretion in THP-1 monocytic cells. Moreover, NO secretion in RAW264.7 macrophage cells was also inhibited.
In summary, MS-275 and SAHA exhibited their anti-rheumatic activities by growth arrest in RA synovial fibroblasts, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO, as well as down-regulation in angiogenesis and MMPs. Their anti-rheumatic activities may be mediated through induction of p21 and suppression of NF-kappaB nuclear accumulation.
Nocturnal asthma reflects the severity of the disease, and thus its pharmacologic prevention represents one on the main goals of asthma management.
To determine whether controlled-release theophylline inhibits the development of airway obstruction and/or airway hyperresponsiveness early in the morning, we examined 18 subjects reporting recurrent nocturnal asthma. In each subject, after five days' treatment with an 8 PM increasing dose of oral controlled-release theophylline, up to 10 +/- 1 mg/kg or placebo the night before the study day, we measured serum theophylline, FEV1 and PC20FEV1 at 6 AM, 2 PM and 10 PM.
At 6 AM, both FEV1 and PC20FEV1 were significantly higher on theophylline than on placebo (3.52 +/- 0.22 versus 3.17 +/- 0.25 L; P < .005 and 2.76 divided by 3.61 versus 1.55 divided by 3.73 mg/mL; P < .05, respectively). At 2 PM and 10 PM FEV1, but not PC20FEV1, was higher on theophylline than on placebo (3.73 +/- 0.21 versus 3.54 +/- 0.25 L; P < .05 and 3.40 +/- 0.22 versus 3.24 +/- 0.24 L; P < .05). Serum theophylline was 12.8 +/- 1.1 micrograms/ml, 8.9 +/- 0.77 and 9.5 +/- 0.85 at 6 AM, 2 PM and 10 PM, respectively.
We conclude that an evening dose of controlled-release theophyl line inhibits early morning airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness, and that it may be helpful in the prevention of nocturnal asthma.
The Coronary Drug Project, conducted during 1966 to 1974, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5 lipid-modifying agents in 8,341 men with previous myocardial infarction. Among the 5 drug treatment regimens, only niacin significantly reduced the risk of (1) cardiovascular events during a mean follow-up of 6.2 years and (2) total mortality during 6.2 years with study treatment plus an additional 9 years of post-trial follow-up (Figure 1). Cardiovascular and total mortality outcomes in the niacin and placebo groups are presented by baseline glycemic status and by change in glycemic status from baseline to year 1.
The frequency of retrobulbar neuritis during a long lasting myambutol therapy increases proportionally with the increased doses. This may be seen in retrospection on 2007 cases divided into 16 groups with doses from 15 till 60 mg per kg of bodyweight. Graphically a function may be established between myambutol doses and frequency of optic neuritis (y = -23.2 + 1.1 x). This shows for 20 mg/kg: 0%, for 25 mg/kg: 5%, for 30 mg/kg: 10% frequency of optic neuritis. Those findings allow a rough evaluation of neuritis risk and confirm clinical observations. A planed examination of patients groups with different myambutol doses checked by myambutol serum levels estimations would help in establishing optimal doses of myambutol.
To determine the effects of high oxygen (O2) tension on pulmonary vascular reactivity, we exposed rats either to 100% O2 for 48 hours or 40% O2 for 3 to 5 weeks. Lungs from all rats were isolated, blood perfused and ventilated, and pressor responses to airway hypoxia and to infused angiotensin II were measured. We found that chronic subtoxic hyperoxia did not augment subsequent hypoxic vasoconstriction, and that 48 hrs of 100% O2 markedly blunted hypoxic vasoconstriction. Meclofenamate restored hypoxic vasoconstriction to control levels in the lungs with blunted responses. Evidence for O2 toxicity in the lungs exposed to 100% O2 included interstitial swelling with alveolar exudates seen by light microscopy, and lung edema by water content calculations. We conclude that 1) chronic subtoxic hyperoxia does not influence subsequent hypoxic vasoconstriction, and 2) a dilator prostaglandin produced in the lung is a potent inhibitor of hypoxic vasoconstriction in O2 toxic lungs.
Metronidazole is a widely prescribed treatment for amoebic and anaerobic germ infections. Its neurologic toxicity is rare but can be serious.
We report the case of a 27-year-old male patient, treated with metronidazole for a cerebral abscess. He presented with a cerebellar syndrome and peripheral neuropathy at a cumulative metronidazole dose of 60g. The MRI aspect of the cerebellar lesions in addition to their reversibility after treatment cessation led to the diagnosis of metronidazole induced neurologic toxicity.
The occurrence of neurologic disorders in patients treated with metronidazole must suggest drug toxicity and lead to cessation of treatment.
Adiponectin is a collagen-like circulating protein secreted by adipocytes that is proposed to mediate obesity-related resistance to insulin. In a case-control series, we assessed the role of adiponectin in later development of type 2 diabetes in 70 patients who later developed type 2 diabetes and 70 controls, matched for body-mass index, age, and sex. Cases and controls were taken from the longitudinal study of health in the Pima Indian population. At baseline, the concentration of adiponectin was lower in cases than in controls (p=0.01) and individuals with high concentrations of this protein were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with low concentrations (incidence rate ratio 0.63 [95% CI 0.43-0.92]; p=0.02).
To study the relationship between the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS) gene and the prognosis of colorectal carcinoma and between the TS expression and the effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) on advanced colorectal carcinoma.
134 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens of colorectal carcinoma obtained during operation from 134 patients, 65 males and 69 females, aged 34 approximately 76 with an average age of 51 +/- 11, 16 with differentiated carcinoma and 118 with undifferentiated carcinoma, 4 with infiltration into mucous layer, 21 into submucous layer, 100 into muscular layer, and 5 into serous layer, 25 without lymphatic metastasis and 109 with lymphatic metastasis, 4 in stage IB, 15 in stage II, 90 in stage IIIA, and 27 in stage IIIB by Dukes staging, underwent immunohistochemistry (ABC methods) to determine the expression of TS. After operation all patients received chemotherapy with leucovorin and 5-Fu for 4 approximately 6 periods and were followed up for 9 approximately 72 months.
Eighty-two specimens showed high TS expression and 52 showed low TS expression. The grade of TS expression was significantly correlated with four clinicopathologic variables: histological type, depth of invasion, lymphatic metastasis, and Dukes' stage (all P < 0.001). The 5-year survival rate for the low TS group was 57.69%, significantly lower than that of the high TS group (21.95%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that three variables (histological type, depth of infiltration, and TS grade) independently contributed to the survival rate (all P < 0.05), especially the TS grade (all P < 0.0001). The relative hazard ratio of TS grade was 1.241.
The expression of TS is one of the important prognosis indicators of colorectal carcinoma. It is also a relatively reliable indicator of whether 5-Fu should be used in the treatment of patients with colorectal carcinoma.
An increasing incidence of bladder neoplasms temporally associated with chemotherapy, usually cyclophosphamide, is being reported. These secondary primary bladder malignancies are characteristically found in two groups of patients: those with lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative tumors, and those with immunosuppression after organ transplantation. A case of adenocarcinoma of the bladder associated with malignant lymphoma is reported, and the known cases of second primary bladder malignancies after cyclophosphamide therapy as reported in the literature are reviewed. Studies relating to the enhanced occurrence of second primary cancers in lymphoproliferative disorders are presented. The recognized urologic toxicities of cyclophosphamide, including cytopathologic changes in animals and humans, are discussed. The observed association between immunosuppression and second primary malignancies is explored, as supported by studies on congenital immunodeficiency in humans, viral oncogenesis in experimental animals, and neoplasia after organ transplantation. Possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis associated with cyclophosphamide are reviewed, including suppression of humoral and cell-mediated immune defense mechanisms, direct carcinogenesis, or cocarcinogenesis. A plea is made for the orderly reporting and careful documentation of bladder tumors in patients receiving cyclophosphamide. It is suggested that prospective studies in these patients and in patients receiving cyclophosphamide for nonmalignant disorders would be of value in assessing the culpability of cyclophosphamide as a carcinogen.
Risperidone is effective for short-term treatment of aggression, temper outbursts, and self-injurious behavior in children with autism. Because these behaviors may be chronic, there is a need to establish the efficacy and safety of longer-term treatment with this agent.
The authors conducted a multisite, two-part study of risperidone in children ages 5 to 17 years with autism accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, and/or self-injurious behavior who showed a positive response in an earlier 8-week trial. Part I consisted of 4-month open-label treatment with risperidone, starting at the established optimal dose; part II was an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-substitution study of risperidone withdrawal. Primary outcome measures were the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale and the Clinical Global Impression improvement scale.
Part I included 63 children. The mean risperidone dose was 1.96 mg/day at entry and remained stable over 16 weeks of open treatment. The change on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale was small and clinically insignificant. Reasons for discontinuation of part I included loss of efficacy (N=5) and adverse effects (N=1). The subjects gained an average of 5.1 kg. Part II included 32 patients. The relapse rates were 62.5% for gradual placebo substitution and 12.5% for continued risperidone; this difference was statistically significant.
Risperidone showed persistent efficacy and good tolerability for intermediate-length treatment of children with autism characterized by tantrums, aggression, and/or self-injurious behavior. Discontinuation after 6 months was associated with a rapid return of disruptive and aggressive behavior in most subjects.
Interactions among beta-carotene (BC), alpha-tocopherol (AT) and ascorbic acid (AA) led to the hypothesis that using a combination of these antioxidants could be more beneficial than using a single antioxidant alone, particularly against smoke-related lung cancer. In this investigation, we have conducted an animal study to determine whether combined BC, AT and AA supplementation (AOX) protects against 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung carcinogenesis in smoke-exposed (SM) ferrets. Ferrets were treated for 6 months in the following four groups: (i) control, (ii) SM + NNK, (iii) AOX and (iv) SM + NNK + AOX. Results showed that the combined AOX supplementation (i) prevented the SM + NNK-decreased lung concentrations of retinoic acid (RA) and BC; (ii) inhibited the SM + NNK-induced phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and proliferating cellular nuclear antigen proteins in the lungs of ferrets; and (iii) blocked the SM + NNK-induced up-regulation of total p53 and Bax proteins, as well as phosphorylated p53 in the lungs of ferrets. In addition, there were no lesions observed in the lung tissue of ferrets in the control and/or the AOX groups after 6 months of intervention, but combined AOX supplementation resulted in a trend toward lower incidence of both preneoplastic lung lesions and lung tumor formation in SM + NNK + AOX group of ferrets, as compared with the SM + NNK group alone. These data indicate that combined AOX supplementation could be a useful chemopreventive strategy against lung carcinogenesis through maintaining normal tissue levels of RA and inhibiting the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, cell proliferation and phosphorylation of p53.
A 42-year-old woman with a long-standing diagnosis of schizophrenia experienced two toxic reactions to 1200 mg of chlorpromazine while awaiting surgery for a locally metastatic carcinoma of the cervix. These reactions, which involved fever, increased pulse and respirations, and acute onset of obtundation, and which cleared after several hours, were produced by a medication and dose which had been well tolerated prior to the preoperative period. These reactions, typical of an acute anticholinergic syndrome, were precipitated by an interaction of the drug and a stress-induced change in her psychological state, due to anxiety about her cancer and impending surgery. This type of reaction has not been reported previously in a clinical setting.
