1, 3-Butadiene (BD) is a high-efficiency carcinogen in rodents and was classified as a human carcinogen in 2008 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. However, its ability to induce genetic damage and the influence of metabolic polymorphisms to such damage in humans are both controversial claims. This study was conducted to investigate the relationships between exposure to BD, the polymorphisms of metabolic genes and the chromosomal damage in 45 pairs of occupationally exposed workers in a BD product workshop and matched control workers in an administrative office and circulatory water workshop in China. Exposure to BD was evaluated by personal sampling and stationary sampling. Different chromosomal damage endpoints in peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined using the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay; polymorphisms of metabolic genes [cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH)] in BD-exposed group were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The results show that the average BD measurements of the exposed group were significantly higher than those for the control group (a personal sampling and stationary sampling, respectively). The BD-exposed workers exhibited increased frequencies of micronuclei (MNi) (8.00 ± 3.78‰ versus 5.62 ± 2.41‰) and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) (2.58 ± 2.79‰ versus 1.13 ± 1.34‰) and a decreased nuclear division index (2.20 ± 0.14 versus 2.35 ± 0.27) when compared subjects in the control group. Meanwhile, BD-exposed workers carrying CYP2E1 c1c2/c2c2 or mEH intermediate (I)/high (H) group had a significantly higher NPB frequency than those carrying CYP2E1 c1c1 [frequency ratio (FR) = 2.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72-3.93; P < 0.0001) or the mEH low(S) group (FR = 2.06, 95% CI% 1.17-3.62; P < 0.05), respectively. Our study suggests that MNi and NPB frequency in CBMN cytome assay could be potential genotoxic biomarkers for BD exposure in humans. The polymorphism of CYP2E1 and mEH could also affect the chromosomal instability of BD workers.
Uterine cancer is a common cause for cancer death in women and there is no effective therapy for metastatic disease. Thus, research is urgently needed to identify new therapeutic agents. We showed previously that all female HMGA1a transgenic mice develop malignant uterine tumors, indicating that HMGA1a causes uterine cancer in vivo. We also demonstrated that HMGA1a up-regulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) during tumorigenesis in this model. Similarly, we found that HMGA1a and COX-2 are overexpressed in human leiomyosarcomas, a highly malignant uterine cancer. Although epidemiologic studies indicate that individuals who take COX inhibitors have a lower incidence of some tumors, these inhibitors have not been evaluated in uterine cancer. Here, we show that HMGA1a mice on sulindac (a COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor) have significantly smaller uterine tumors than controls. To determine if COX inhibitors are active in human uterine cancers that overexpress HMGA1a, we treated cultured cells with sulindac sulfide or celecoxib (a specific COX-2 inhibitor). Both drugs block anchorage-independent growth in high-grade human uterine cancer cells that overexpress HMGA1a (MES-SA cells). In contrast, neither inhibitor blocked transformation in cells that do not overexpress HMGA1a. Moreover, xenograft tumors from MES-SA cells were significantly inhibited in mice on sulindac. More strikingly, no tumors formed in mice on celecoxib. These preclinical studies suggest that COX inhibitors could play a role in preventing tumor onset or progression in uterine cancers with dysregulation of the HMGA1a-COX-2 pathway. Importantly, these drugs have lower toxicity than chemotherapeutic agents used to treat advanced-stage uterine cancers.
Stevens-Johnson syndrome and the related disease toxic epidermal necrolysis are life-threatening reactions of the skin to particular types of medication. Here we show that there is a strong association in Han Chinese between a genetic marker, the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by carbamazepine, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of seizures. It should be possible to exploit this association in a highly reliable test to predict severe adverse reaction, as well as for investigation of the pathogenesis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Acidosis and angiotensin II stimulate ammonia production and transport by the proximal tubule. We examined the modulatory effect of the type 1 angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan on the ability of metabolic acidosis to stimulate ammonia production and secretion by mouse S2 proximal tubule segments. Mice given NH(4)Cl for 7 days developed metabolic acidosis (low serum bicarbonate concentration) and increased urinary excretion of ammonia. S2 tubule segments from acidotic mice displayed higher rates of ammonia production and secretion compared with those from control mice. However, when losartan was coadministered in vivo with NH(4)Cl, both the acidosis-induced increase in urinary ammonia excretion and the adaptive increase in ammonia production and secretion of microperfused S2 segments were largely blocked. In renal cortical tissue, losartan blocked the acid-induced increase in brush-border membrane NHE3 expression but had no effect on the acid-induced upregulation of phosphate-dependent glutaminase or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 in cortical homogenates. Addition of angiotensin II to the microperfusion solution enhanced ammonia secretion and production rates in tubules from NH(4)Cl-treated and control mice in a losartan-inhibitable manner. These results demonstrate that a 7-day acid challenge induces an adaptive increase in ammonia production and secretion by the proximal tubule and suggest that during metabolic acidosis, angiotensin II signaling is necessary for adaptive enhancements of ammonia excretion by the kidney and ammonia production and secretion by S2 proximal tubule segments, as mediated, in part, by angiotensin receptor-dependent enhancement of NHE3 expression.
Benzene is a ubiquitous occupational and environmental toxicant. Exposures to benzene both prenatally and during adulthood are associated with the development of disorders such as aplastic anemia and leukemia. Mechanisms of benzene toxicity are unknown; however, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by benzene metabolites may play a role. Little is known regarding the effects of benzene metabolites on erythropoiesis. Therefore, to determine the effects of in utero exposure to benzene on the growth and differentiation of fetal erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E), pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed to benzene and CFU-E numbers were assessed in fetal liver (hematopoietic) tissue. In addition, to determine the effect of benzene metabolite-induced ROS generation on erythropoiesis, HD3 chicken erythroblast cells were exposed to benzene, phenol, or hydroquinone followed by stimulation of erythrocyte differentiation. Our results show that in utero exposure to benzene caused significant alterations in female offspring CFU-E numbers. In addition, exposure to hydroquinone, but not benzene or phenol, significantly reduced the percentage of differentiated HD3 cells, which was associated with an increase in ROS. Pretreatment of HD3 cells with polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) prevented hydroquinone-induced inhibition of erythropoiesis, supporting the hypothesis that ROS generation is involved in the development of benzene erythrotoxicity. In conclusion, this study provided evidence that ROS generated as a result of benzene metabolism may significantly alter erythroid differentiation, potentially leading to the development of Blood Disorders.
All major guidelines for antihypertensive therapy recommend weight loss; anti-obesity drugs might be a helpful option.
