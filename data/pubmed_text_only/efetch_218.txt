Fibrates, such as fenofibrate, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) agonists and have been used for several decades as hypolipidemic agents in the clinic. However, contradictory observations exist on the role of fibrates in host response to acute inflammation, with unclear mechanisms. The role of PPARα in colitis was assessed using fenofibrate and Ppara-null mice. Wild-type or Ppara-null mice were subjected to acute colitis under three distinct protocols, dextran sulfate sodium, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, and Salmonella Typhi. Serum and colon lipidomics were analyzed to characterize the metabolic profiles by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Messenger RNAs of PPARα target genes and genes involved in inflammation were determined by qunatitative PCR analysis. Fenofibrate treatment exacerbated inflammation and tissue injury in acute colitis, and this was dependent on PPARα activation. Lipidomics analysis revealed that bioactive sphingolipids, including sphingomyelins (SM) and ceramides, were significantly increased in the colitis group compared with the control group; this was further potentiated following fenofibrate treatment. In the colon, fenofibrate did not reduce the markedly increased expression of mRNA encoding TNFα found in the acute colitis model, while it decreased hydrolysis and increased synthesis of SM, upregulated RIPK3-dependent necrosis, and elevated mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, which were possibly related to the exacerbated colitis.
The role of free radical generation and its scavenging enzymes in circulating mice polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) has been studied following pulmonary thromboembolism. Levels of malonaldehyde (MDA), 02- radical generation, activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lysozyme were estimated in lysed neutrophil preparations. Activities of SOD and CAT were increased in neutrophils, while animals showed 60 +/- 4% thrombocytopenia. Levels of MDA in PMNLs were also elevated significantly following thrombosis. However, there was no significant change in superoxide radical generation, after thrombotic challenge, in mice neutrophils. The present study provides evidence for the involvement of free radicals in mice pulmonary thromboembolism.
The association of various diuretic therapies with the renal handling of minerals, important factors in the development of nephrocalcinosis and osteopenia, was studied in low birth weight infants. Twenty-four-hour urine specimens (n = 65) were collected from 30 patients who were treated with (1) furosemide with or without spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide (2) spironolactone with hydrochlorothiazide, (3) spironolactone alone, or (4) no diuretic (control; i.e., after diuretic). Hypercalciuria (urinary calcium greater than or equal to 0.15 mmol/kg/day) was observed in all but the control group. Covariate analysis demonstrated a significant effect of sodium, calcium, and vitamin D intakes (p less than 0.01) and sodium excretion (p less than 0.05) on urinary calcium excretion. Treatment with any of these diuretics in neonates may be associated with abnormal renal losses of calcium, sodium, chloride, and potassium. From a nutritional perspective, neonates requiring long-term diuretic therapy thereby require special consideration, including monitoring of mineral excretion and renal ultrasonography.
This study was designed to use urokinase (UK) in combination with batroxobin in thrombolytic therapy so as to see whether batroxobin(DF-521) would be effective for neuroprotection.
The model of right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in male SD rats was established. 120 rats were randomized into 9 groups, namely control group, sham control group, and groups that were treated with batroxobin and urokinase together or separately. Each group comprised 15 rats. Intracranial bleeding, infarct volume ratio and neurological function were observed.
Intracranial bleeding was found in 5 rats of the UK 5000 U/kg group, in 4 rats of the UK 5000 U/kg (2 h) + DF-521 5 BU/kg (2 h) group, and in only 1 rat of the UK 5000 U/kg (2 h) + DF-521 5 BU/kg (1 h) group. Cerebral infarct volume ratio was obviously reduced in 5 BU/kg batroxobin group. No difference was observed in neurological deficit scores.
5000 U/kg urokinase increased the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in rat MCAO model. Batroxobin either used separately or in combination with urokinase would not increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in rat MCAO model.
Embryonic exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin during gonadal sex determination appears to promote an epigenetic reprogramming of the male germ line that is associated with transgenerational adult-onset disease states. Transgenerational effects on the embryonic day 16 (E16) testis demonstrated reproducible changes in the testis transcriptome for multiple generations (F1-F3). The expression of 196 genes was found to be influenced, with the majority of gene expression being decreased or silenced. Dramatic changes in the gene expression of methyltransferases during gonadal sex determination were observed in the F1 and F2 vinclozolin generation (E16) embryonic testis, but the majority returned to control-generation levels by the F3 generation. The most dramatic effects were on the germ-line-associated Dnmt3A and Dnmt3L isoforms. Observations demonstrate that an embryonic exposure to vinclozolin appears to promote an epigenetic reprogramming of the male germ line that correlates with transgenerational alterations in the testis transcriptome in subsequent generations.
Although atopic dermatitis (AD) is the initial step of the "atopic march", a progression from AD to asthma, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Selective expression of IL-13 in the skin of mice caused an AD phenotype resembling human AD, and the disorder was associated with enhanced production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in the AD skin with a systemic Th2 immunity. Here we show that IL-13 transgenic mice with AD had significantly enhanced lung inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) when sensitized and challenged by allergen. In addition, the level of TSLP was significantly higher in acute AD than in chronic AD. Furthermore, elimination of TSLP signaling significantly diminished the allergic asthma responses, immune cell production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13), and serum IgE. These studies indicate that IL-13 induces AD and atopic march via a TSLP dependent mechanism.
Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas are uncommon in rodents and humans and, as such, the mechanisms giving rise to these tumors are poorly understood. Inactivating mutations in the p53 gene have been detected in sporadic and chemically induced human and rodent hemangiosarcomas. Additionally, experimental ablation of p53 function in mice by targeted gene disruption increases the incidence of both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced vascular tumors. These findings implicate p53 disruption in vascular tumor development. In this study, we characterized p53 inactivation immunocytochemically and by gene sequencing in a large number of vascular tumors that developed in B6C3F1 mice during a long-term (2-year) study of the thiazolidinedione troglitazone. For comparative purposes, a murine hemangiosarcoma induced by polyoma middle-T antigen, which transforms endothelial cells via a p53-independent mechanism, five spontaneous human hemangiosarcoma specimens, and species-specific positive control tissues were also evaluated by immunocytochemistry for p53 inactivation. While 20% of the human hemangiosarcomas and all positive control tissues expressed significant levels of nuclear p53, indicating functional inactivation of the protein, none of the 161 mouse vascular tumors studied expressed detectable p53 protein. The absence of inactivating mutations was confirmed in eight of the histologically most malignant mouse hemangiosarcomas by sequencing exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene. These results demonstrate that p53 inactivation did not play a role in development of the vascular tumors seen in the long-term study of troglitazone, and they indicate that loss of p53 function is not essential for vascular tumor development in mice.
Severe and reversible electrocardiographic abnormalities (first degree atrioventricular block, left bundle branch block, ventricular fibrillation), were induced by the administration of Arfonad in a patient with type III acute aortic dissection previously chronically treated with alpha-methyl-dopa. Any other possible cause of the electrocardiographic changes was excluded on the basis of clinical findings and laboratory studies. The explanation of the electrocardiographic abnormalities induced by Arfonad are not readily apparent, also on careful review of the literature. We suggest a strict electrocardiographic monitoring during Arfonad administration especially in patients with cardiac conduction defects and previous administration of cardiac cathecholamines depleting drugs.
Isoniazid chemoprophylaxis recommendations include its use in persons who have positive tuberculin reactions, but neither recent conversion nor other activation risk factors, only if they are under age 35 years. Above this threshold, the isoniazid hepatitis risk is said to outweigh the benefit of preventing activation. Because this policy is controversial, we performed a decision analysis contrasting those who take with those who decline isoniazid therapy according to three outcome measures: life expectancy, likelihood of illness (isoniazid hepatitis and active tuberculosis), and likelihood of fatal illness. We found no threshold between ages 10 and 80 years by the measures of life expectancy and likelihood of fatal illness; isoniazid benefits outweigh risks for all, though the margin is small for the elderly. A threshold exists only in the likelihood of illness: isoniazid risks outweigh benefits for those aged 50 to 65 years. Only extreme variations of assumptions affect these findings. Chemoprophylaxis recommendations should include low-risk tuberculin reactors over age 35 years.
The introduction of ethambutol and rifampicin has modified the therapy of tuberculosis. Therapy in hospitals or sanatoria can be shortened, and intermittent regimens (once or twice weekly under supervision) are possible. Better knowledge of the side effects of particular drugs, particularly rifampicin, (such as allergic reactions in intermittent administration and reduced effect of oral contraceptives) has been gained. Instead of mere supervision, preventive chemotherapy is given in many cases such as in recently discovered fibrotic lesions and in high risk cases (silicosis, treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents)minadequate treatment may lead to functional impairment such as fibrosis and cor pulmonale. These aspects are discussed and the resultant guidelines for the treatment of tuberculosis are presented.
The introduction of ethambutol and rifampicin has changed tuberculos is treatment, rendering possible ambulatory treatment with intermittent regimens. The steroid metabolic effects of Rifampicin, however, pose problems when tuberculostatic and contraceptive therapies are concurrent. It has been reported that metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is intensified by a factor of 4 during rifampicin therapy, explaining the cases of pregnancy occurring during simultaneous rifampicin and contraceptive therapy. Menstrual cycle disturbances have also been observed in patients treated only with Rifampicin. The author recommends that oral contraceptives and rifampicin not to be taken together; which course of therapy should be preferred depends on the ind ividual situation.
Alteration in the intracellular signal transduction pathway in primary afferent neurons may contribute to pain hypersensitivity. We demonstrated that very rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (pERK) occurred in DRG neurons that were taking part in the transmission of various noxious signals. The electrical stimulation of Adelta fibers induced pERK primarily in neurons with myelinated fibers. c-Fiber activation by capsaicin injection induced pERK in small neurons with unmyelinated fibers containing vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1), suggesting that pERK labeling in DRG neurons is modality specific. Electrical stimulation at the c-fiber level with different intensities and frequencies revealed that phosphorylation of ERK is dependent on the frequency. We examined the pERK in the DRG after application of natural noxious stimuli and found a stimulus intensity-dependent increase in labeled cell size and in the number of activated neurons in the c- and Adelta-fiber population. Immunohistochemical double labeling with phosphorylated ERK/VR-1 and pharmacological study demonstrated that noxious heat stimulation induced pERK in primary afferents in a VR-1-dependent manner. Capsaicin injection into the skin also increased pERK labeling significantly in peripheral fibers and terminals in the skin, which was prevented by a mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor, 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminopheylthio)butadiene (U0126). Behavioral experiments showed that U0126 dose-dependently attenuated thermal hyperalgesia after capsaicin injection and suggested that the activation of ERK pathways in primary afferent neurons is involved in the sensitization of primary afferent neurons. Thus, pERK in primary afferents by noxious stimulation in vivo showed distinct characteristics of expression and may be correlated with the functional activity of primary afferent neurons.
Inhaled corticosteroids provide first-line treatment for asthma. An advance to improve potency was to produce new molecules with increased glucocorticoid receptor affinity (eg, fluticasone propionate [FP]). An alternative is to deliver more medication to both the large and small airway inflammation of asthma by using an extrafine aerosol (eg, beclomethasone dipropionate extrafine aerosol [BDP-extrafinel).
To demonstrate clinical equivalence of BDP-extrafine (400 microg daily) and FP (400 microg daily) in symptomatic asthmatic patients over the course of 6 weeks.
This was a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter, 6-week study in adults with asthma taking conventional FP 100 to 250 microg daily or equivalent, and displaying signs/symptoms of active disease requiring additional therapy.
Eighty-eight patients were randomized to BDP-extrafine (and FP-placebo) and 84 to FP (and BDP-placebo). There were no significant differences between treatments with respect to symptom control, as evidenced by mean change from baseline in percentage days without asthma symptoms/nights without sleep disturbance observed at weeks 1 to 2, 3 to 4, or 5 to 6. Mean changes from baseline in AM PEFR at weeks 5 to 6 for BDP-extrafine (19.0) and FP (30.5) were equivalent (P = 0.022 for equivalence). There were significant (P < 0.001) within-treatment-group differences in mean change from baseline in AM PEFR at weeks 1 to 2 for both treatments. There was no difference in the incidence of patients reporting at least one adverse event during the study (BDP-extrafine 41%; FP 37%). Mean percentage change from baseline for AM plasma cortisol at week 6 was + 17.7% for BDP-extrafine and +4.2% for FP (P = 0.066 for difference).
BDP-extrafine and FP at doses of 400 microg daily provided equivalent asthma control in patients with symptomatic asthma and exhibited similar safety profiles.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are increasingly used for cancer treatment, but commonly carry dermatologic side effects. Periungual inflammation is a particularly painful condition that additionally worsens quality of life. In this paper, we report 3 cases of successful treatment of periungual inflammation induced by 3 different EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib, and cetuximab) with topically applied adapalene.
Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a characteristic finding in common neurological disorders. Human data suggest BBB disruption may underlie cerebral dysfunction. Animal experiments show the development of epileptiform activity following BBB breakdown. In the present study we investigated the neurophysiological, structural and functional consequences of BBB disruption. Adult rats underwent focal BBB disruption in the rat sensory-motor cortex using the bile salt sodium deoxycholate (DOC). Magnetic resonance imaging in-vivo showed an early BBB disruption with delayed reduction in cortical volume. This was associated with a reduced number of neurons and an increased number of astrocytes. In-vitro experiments showed that the threshold for spreading depression and the propagation velocity of the evoked epileptic potentials were increased 1 month after treatment. Furthermore, animals' motor functions deteriorated during the first few weeks following BBB disruption. Treatment with serum albumin resulted in a similar cell loss confirming that the effect of DOC was due to opening of the BBB. Our findings suggest that delayed neurodegeneration and functional impairment occur following the development of the epileptic focus in the BBB-permeable cerebral cortex.
Since 1980 I have examined some 1650 patients for the presence or absence of antimalarial maculopathy. Bilateral, irreversible visual field defects have been diagnosed is 62 patients, 37 of whom have been followed for at least 4 years. The 22 patients who presented with relative scotomas did not lose central visual acuity; over a median follow-up period of 6.0 years 33 (75%) of the eyes maintained their visual field, 5 (11%) showed some improvement in visual field, 4 (9%) lost some visual field, and 2 (4%) manifested small absolute scotomas. Nine (60%) of the 15 patients who presented with absolute scotomas were symptomatic. Over a median follow-up period of 8.8 years 19 (63%) of the eyes in this group lost one or more lines of visual acuity, including 4 (13%) that became legally blind; 19 (63%) lost field owing to an increase in the size of the absolute scotomas (13 eyes) or the development of new absolute scotomas (6 eyes). The results suggest that the visual prognosis is excellent if antimalarial therapy is stopped at an early stage of the disease.
We report a case of cholestatic hepatitis accompanied by peripheral and hepatic eosinophilia in a patient taking acetohexamide for a period of 1.5 yr. Jaundice developed acutely and was accompanied by fever. After discontinuation of the drug, there was no evidence of further damage, with prompt normalization of liver enzymes, bilirubin, and eosinophil count.
Although dexamethasone (DEX) is known to cause hypertension in humans and in animals, the hemodynamic characteristics of DEX-induced hypertension (DEX-HT) in the rat remain unclear. This study evaluated central and regional hemodynamics, and the role of total peripheral resistance (TPR) using a vasodilator minoxidil. Rats were divided into four groups, namely saline (n=20), DEX (n=21), minoxidil+saline (n=10) and minoxidil+DEX (n=10). Tail-cuff systolic blood pressure was recorded every second day. After 10-14 days of treatment, central (saline: n=9, DEX: n=10) and regional (saline: n=11, DEX: n=11) hemodynamic parameters were measured. Central hemodynamic data were also obtained from minoxidil-treated rats. DEX increased blood pressure (P<0.0005) in association with an increase in TPR (P<0.05). However, individual assessments of renal, mesenteric and hindquarter circulations did not detect any significant increase in resistance in these beds. Minoxidil increased cardiac output (P'<0.01) and cardiac index (P'<0.005) as well as decreased TPR (P'<0.05) without affecting DEX-HT. DEX prevented weight gain and decreased thymus weight. The increase in TPR in DEX-HT in rats was not simply explained by isolated alterations to resistance in the renal, mesenteric or hindquarter circulations. Minoxidil effectively prevented the increase in TPR but not the increase in blood pressure, suggesting that an increase in TPR is not essential for DEX-induced blood pressure increase.
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are common conditions that are difficult to treat effectively. Psychopharmacologic agents, particularly tricyclic antidepressants, are now being used as adjunctive therapy in bulimia. The case of a 15-year-old girl with bulimia who was treated with imipramine and had a severe (and first) manic episode is presented. The complication of drug-induced mania observed in patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants is discussed.
Neuroendocrine (NE) cells may play a role in prostate cancer progression. Both androgen deprivation and cAMP are well known inducers of NE differentiation (NED) in the prostate. Gene-expression profiling of LNCaP cells, incubated in androgen stripped medium, showed that the Cbeta isoform of PKA is up-regulated during NE differentiation. Furthermore, by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis, we observed that the Cbeta splice variants are differentially regulated during this process. Whereas the Cbeta2 splice variant is down-regulated in growth arrested LNCaP cells, the Cbeta1, Cbeta3 and Cbeta4 variants, as well as the RIIbeta subunit of PKA, are induced in NE-like LNCaP cells. The opposite effect of Cbeta expression could be mimicked by androgen stimulation, implying the Cbeta gene of PKA as a putative new target gene for the androgen receptor in prostate cancer. Moreover, to investigate expression of PKA subunits during prostate cancer progression, we did immunoblotting of several prostatic cell lines and normal and tumor tissue from prostate cancer patients. Interestingly, multiple Cbeta subunits were also observed in human prostate specimens, and the Cbeta2 variant was up-regulated in tumor cells. In conclusion, it seems that the Cbeta isoforms play different roles in proliferation and differentiation and could therefore be potential markers for prostate cancer progression.
The authors describe two cases of tardive akathisia following metoclopramide therapy, in which there were concomitant symptoms of agitated depression.
After enteral administration of 200 mg/kg alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) female Wistar rats develop a hyperlipemia. 48 h after administration of alpha-HCH, serum triglycerides are increased by 300%, whereas both serum cholesterol and serum total phospholipids only increase by about 45%. Serum free fatty acids are not significantly altered. Fractionation of the serum lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation shows that the hyperlipemia is due to a fivefold increase in serum very low density lipoproteins. Hepatic triglyceride secretion, calculated after i.v. injection of Triton WR 1339, is increased in animals pretreated wtih alpha-HCH. Corresponding to this observation, drugs known to diminish the triglyceride secretion of the liver, such as actinomycin D, cycloheximide; glucagon, orotic acid, CFT 1201, and CFT 1042 reduce the alpha-HCH-induced hyperlipemia. We concluded from the results that hyperlipoproteinemia after alpha-HCH is due to an increased hepatic very low density lipoprotein secretion. At the same time, the blood sugar level was decreased in fasting animals after treatment with alpha-HCH. Earlier experiments suggest that this effect is due to a decreased gluconeogenesis in the liver.
α-synuclein (aS) is a natively unfolded pre-synaptic protein found in all Parkinson's disease patients as the major component of fibrillar plaques. Metal ions, and especially Cu(II), have been demonstrated to accelerate aggregation of aS into fibrillar plaques, the precursors to Lewy bodies. In this work, copper binding to aS is investigated by a combination of quantum and molecular mechanics simulations. Starting from the experimentally observed attachment site, several optimized structures of Cu-binding geometries are examined. The most energetically favorable attachment results in significant allosteric changes, making aS more susceptible to misfolding. Indeed, an inverse kinematics investigation of the configuration space uncovers a dynamically stable β-sheet conformation of Cu-aS that serves as a nucleation point for a second β-strand. Based on these findings, we propose an atomistic mechanism of copper-induced misfolding of aS as an initial event in the formation of Lewy bodies and thus in PD pathogenesis.
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is rare, nearly always fatal, and to the authors' knowledge has few nonsurgical treatment options. Based on in vitro studies demonstrating the efficacy of mitotane as a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) antagonist, and expression of high levels of Pgp in ACC, the authors conducted a study of infusional doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide with oral mitotane +/- surgical resection in patients with metastatic ACC.
Thirty-six patients with metastatic ACC received daily oral mitotane (mean, 4.6 g/day) and 96-hour infusional doxorubicin (10 mg/m(2)/day), etoposide (75 mg/m(2)/day), and vincristine (0.4 mg/m(2)/day). Four responding patients (11%) underwent surgery.
Thirty-five patients were evaluable; all had metastatic disease. Eleven patients had not undergone resection of the primary tumor. Approximately 53% of patients had functional tumors. A total of 190 cycles were administered to 36 patients. Responses were observed in 8 patients (22%): 1 complete, 4 partial, and 3 minor responses. The mean duration of response was 12.4 months. Using a landmark method, the median survival of patients who did not respond to chemotherapy was 11.6 months from a point 4 months after the initiation of therapy, whereas that of 8 patients who demonstrated a response to chemotherapy was 34.3 months from that same landmark. High levels of Pgp expression were documented in nine of nine tumors. Mitotane levels > 10 microg/mL, previously shown to antagonize Pgp in vitro, were achieved in 25 of 36 patients (69%). However, rhodamine efflux from CD56-positive cells was not impaired, suggesting poor in vivo Pgp inhibition. The predominant Grade 3/4 toxicity (according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute) was neutropenia in 66% of cycles; however, fever occurred in only 3% of cycles. Daily mitotane was associated with Grade 1/2 nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric changes in 31 of 36 patients (86%).
Using a combination regimen of daily mitotane with infusional doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide in patients with metastatic ACC, responses were observed in 22% of patients. The superiority of this combination over single-agent mitotane is uncertain. The side effects of mitotane made treatment difficult. More effective Pgp antagonists are needed.
Tolerance to the analgesic effect of an opioid is a pharmacological phenomenon that occurs after its prolonged administration. Activation of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) has been implicated in the cellular mechanisms of opioid tolerance. However, activation of NMDARs can lead to neurotoxicity under many circumstances. Here we demonstrate that spinal neuronal apoptosis was induced in rats made tolerant to morphine administered through intrathecal boluses or continuous infusion. The apoptotic cells were predominantly located in the superficial spinal cord dorsal horn, and most apoptotic cells also expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase, a key enzyme for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Consistently, increased nociceptive sensitivity to heat stimulation was observed in these same rats. Mechanistically, the spinal glutamatergic activity modulated morphine-induced neuronal apoptosis, because pharmacological perturbation of the spinal glutamate transporter activity or coadministration of morphine with the NMDAR antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate affected both morphine tolerance and neuronal apoptosis. At the intracellular level, prolonged morphine administration resulted in an upregulation of the proapoptotic caspase-3 and Bax proteins but a downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Furthermore, coadministration with morphine of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (a pan-caspase inhibitor) or acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspart-1-aldehyde (a relatively selective caspase-3 inhibitor) blocked morphine-induced neuronal apoptosis. Blockade of the spinal caspase-like activity also partially prevented morphine tolerance and the associated increase in nociceptive sensitivity. These results indicate an opioid-induced neurotoxic consequence regulated by the NMDAR-caspase pathway, a mechanism that may have clinical implications in opioid therapy and substance abuse.
Perfusion of the isolated heart with Krebs solution containing 5 and 20 microgram/ml of adrenaline induced cardiocyte micronecrosis. Perfusion with 0.5 microgram/ml of adrenaline induced no micronecrosis. Dispersion analysis showed a statistically significant effect of adrenaline concentrations on the degree of the cardionecrotic effect. The fact of micronecrosis appearance in the isolated heart during its perfusion with saline solution requires revision of the hypothesis on the leading role of blood factor in the realization of the cardionecrotic effect of adrenaline. The appearance of micronecroses with the action of adrenaline in concentrations which activate the mechanism of amines uptake by the heart myocytes speaks in favour of the casual relationship between the accumulation of the biogenic amines by myocytes and the development of their necrosis.
