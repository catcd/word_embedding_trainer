Rats' locomotor reactivity to an inescapable novel environment has been shown to be correlated with the psychomotor response to many stimulant drugs. However, the effects of nicotine on rats categorized as high responder (HR) or low responder (LR) has yielded inconclusive results. This study examined the effects of nicotine ditartrate in HR and LR rats using both a high (0.8 mg/kg; freebase) and a low dose (0.2 mg/kg; freebase). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained for the acquisition of nicotine-induced conditioned hyperactivity. After conditioned-hyperactivity testing, rats underwent extinction training to decrease hyperactivity by administering saline as a substitution for nicotine. Hyperactivity was then reinstated with a nicotine challenge (0.8 or 0.2 mg/kg). Pretreatment with nicotine during acquisition training significantly increased locomotor activity. Similarly, rats that had nicotine repeatedly paired with a distinct environment displayed significant conditioned hyperactivity and reinstatement of nicotine-induced hyperactivity. However, nicotine treatment was not found to differentially affect HR and LR rats. These data suggest that individual differences in response to an inescapable novel environment do not predict nicotine-induced locomotor sensitivity or sensitivity to nicotine-associated drug cues.
Cardiovascular and respiratory activity of mu, delta and kappa opioid agonists were investigated utilizing microinjections into the n. preopticus medialis (POM) and periventricularis hypothalami (HPV) of anesthetized rats. Injections of the relative mu agonists Morphine and Morphiceptin the delta agonist D-Ala2, D-Leu5-Enkephalin (DADL) or the putative kappa agonist Dynorphin 1-13 into the HPV caused hypotension and bradypnea; Morphine produced tachycardia while DADL and Dynorphin bradycardia. In the POM, injections of Morphine or DADL increased blood pressure and heart rate whereas Dynorphin caused hypotension and bradycardia. At this site, the mu agonist D-Ala2-MePhe4-Gly5-ol-Enkephalin (DAGO) produced hypotension, tachycardia and bradypnea, DAGO and DADL but not Morphine or Dynorphin also caused bradypnea in this region. These data show that the central cardiovascular and respiratory effects of opioids vary according to injection site and opioid subtype and may differ from findings obtained using cerebroventricular injections.
The effects of four isomeric forms of aminophenols, ortho-, meta-, para-aminophenol and acetaminophen (o-, m-, p-AP and AAP, respectively) on liver and kidney carcinogenesis initiated by N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine (EHEN) were tested. Rats were given 0.1% EHEN (in their drinking water for 2 weeks) and then diet containing these compounds at concentrations of 0.8% for 49 weeks. Administration of o-AP and AAP significantly decreased the number and area of preneoplastic foci staining immunohistochemically for glutathione S-transferase placental type (GST-P) per unit area of liver section as compared with the values for rats given EHEN alone. o-AP and AAP also significantly decreased the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, p-AP and AAP significantly increased quantitative values for kidney preneoplastic lesions and renal cell adenoma. It is suggested that the cytotoxic effects of these chemicals preferentially suppressed the proliferation of preneoplastic liver cells, but stimulated the mitotic activity of preneoplastic tubular lesions in the kidney.
Herpes zoster leukoencephalitis is a rare complication of varicella-zoster virus infection. Associated with high mortality, the majority of cases have been discovered postmortem; today, however, magnetic resonance imaging is being used successfully as an aid in the diagnosis of this disease. The first two reported cases of HIV-infected patients with herpes zoster leukoencephalitis who recovered clinically and showed complete resolution of the magnetic resonance demyelination images after acyclovir treatment are described. In addition, the cases of herpes zoster leukoencephalitis reported in the literature to date are reviewed.
A new variant of a group of pediatric neurodegenerative diseases known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or Batten disease has been identified. It is termed CLN9-deficient. CLN9-deficient fibroblasts have a distinctive phenotype of rapid growth and increased apoptosis and diminished levels of ceramide, dihydroceramide, and sphingomyelin. Transfection with CLN8 but not other NCL genes corrected growth and apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells, although the entire CLN8 sequence was normal. CLN8 is one of the TRAM-Lag1-CLN8 proteins containing a Lag1 motif. The latter imparts (dihydro)ceramide synthase activity to yeast cells. Transfection with the yeast gene Lag1 Sc and the human homolog LASS1 increased ceramide levels and partially corrected growth and apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells. LASS2,-4,,-5, and -6 also corrected growth and apoptosis. Dihydroceramide levels and dihydroceramide synthase activity were markedly diminished in CLN9-deficient cells. Sequencing of LASS1, LASS2, LASS4, LASS5, and LASS6 genes was normal, and expression levels were increased or normal in CLN9-deficient cells by reverse transcription-PCR. N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR), a dihydroceramide synthase activator, corrected growth and apoptosis and increased dihydroceramide synthase activity. Ceramide levels dropped further, and there was no increase in de novo ceramide synthesis, probably due to the effects of 4-HPR as activator of dihydroceramide synthase and inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase. Fumonisin B1, a dihydroceramide synthase inhibitor, exaggerated the CLN9-deficient phenotype of accelerated growth, decreased ceramide and increased apoptosis. This was neutralized by 4-HPR. We conclude that the CLN9 protein may be a regulator of dihydroceramide synthase and that 4-HPR could be developed as a treatment for CLN9-deficient patients.
Few population studies have reported on the long-term changes in the internal cadmium dose and simultaneously occurring mortality.
We monitored blood cadmium (BCd), 24-hr urinary cadmium (UCd), and mortality in an environmentally exposed population.
Starting from 1985, we followed BCd (until 2003), UCd (until 1996), and mortality (until 2007) among 476 and 480 subjects, randomly recruited from low- exposure areas (LEA) and high-exposure areas (HEA). The last cadmium-producing plant in the HEA closed in 2002.
From 1985-1989 to 1991-1996, BCd decreased by 40.3% and 18.9% in the LEA and HEA, respectively (p < 0.0001 for between-area difference). From 1991-1996 until 2001-2003, BCd remained unchanged in the HEA (+ 1.8%) and increased by 19.7% in the LEA (p < 0.0001). Over the entire follow-up period, the annual decrease in BCd averaged 2.7% in the LEA (n = 258) and 1.8% in the HEA (n = 203). From 1985-1989 to 1991-1996, UCd fell by 12.9% in the LEA and by 16.6% in the HEA (p = 0.22), with mean annual decreases of 2.7% (n = 366) and 3.4% (n = 364). Over 20.3 years (median), 206 deaths (21.5%) occurred. At baseline, BCd (14.6 vs. 10.2 nmol/L) and UCd (14.1 vs. 8.6 nmol/24-hr) were higher in deaths than in survivors. The risks (p < or = 0.04) associated with a doubling of baseline UCd were 20% and 44% for total and noncardiovascular mortality, and 25% and 33% for a doubling of BCd.
Even if zinc-cadmium smelters close, historical environmental contamination remains a persistent source of exposure. Environmental exposure to cadmium increases total and noncardiovascular mortality in a continuous fashion without threshold.
Oxcarbazepine is an antiepileptic drug (AED) indicated for use as monotherapy and add-on therapy in adults and children 4 years of age and older. Despite being structurally related to carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine differs substantially in its pharmacokinetic and safety profile; oxcarbazepine has a much lower risk of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions than carbamazepine. Carbamazepine has also been shown to induce the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin, thus reducing free serum testosterone levels and possibly causing erectile dysfunction (ED) in some men; these effects have not been observed with oxcarbazepine. This paper provides a discussion of recent clinical experience with men who presented in private clinical practice with complaints of ED while being treated with carbamazepine for seizure disorders. The four illustrative case studies presented in this report suggest that switching AED treatment from carbamazepine to oxcarbazepine in men with epilepsy can reduce the ED side effects observed with carbamazepine.
Prospective cohort studies constitute the major source of evidence about the mortality effects of chronic exposure to particulate air pollution. Additional studies are needed to provide evidence on the health effects of chronic exposure to particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5)) because few studies have been carried out and the cohorts have not been representative.
This study was designed to estimate the relative risk of death associated with long-term exposure to PM(2.5) by region and age groups in a U.S. population of elderly, for the period 2000-2005.
By linking PM(2.5) monitoring data to the Medicare billing claims by ZIP code of residence of the enrollees, we have developed a new retrospective cohort study, the Medicare Cohort Air Pollution Study. The study population comprises 13.2 million participants living in 4,568 ZIP codes having centroids within 6 miles of a PM(2.5) monitor. We estimated relative risks adjusted by socioeconomic status and smoking by fitting log-linear regression models.
In the eastern and central regions, a 10-microg/m(3) increase in 6-year average of PM(2.5) is associated with 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.9-8.7%] and 13.2% (95% CI, 9.5-16.9) increases in mortality, respectively. We found no evidence of an association in the western region or for persons > or = 85 years of age.
We established a cohort of Medicare participants for investigating air pollution and mortality on longer-term time frames. Chronic exposure to PM(2.5) was associated with mortality in the eastern and central regions, but not in the western United States.
One hundred and eighty six cases of amineptine abuse were reported to the Regional Centres of Pharmacovigilance or to the Laboratory Eutherapie during a ten year period, between 1978 and february 1988. The analysis was carried out on 155 cases. The principal characteristics of overconsumption are: a predominance of females; the existence of risk factors in 2 out of 3 cases; the absence of correlations between the prescribed dosage, the duration and the importance of abuse; the constant search of a psychostimulant effect; a good clinical acceptability in most cases, but the risk of acne and psychic disturbances must be emphasized; withdrawal difficulties, obtained in only 48 patients (for at least one month). Psychic symptoms on withdrawal were variable and it was not possible to identify a syndrome. The risk of abuse seems to be rare, nevertheless, one must know this occurrence and respect the recommanded dosage. In patients with certain psychiatric illnesses, and especially in patients with risks factors, drugs with stimulant properties should be prescribed with caution.
The mechanism by which cysteamine reduces the PRL content of pituitary cells was studied in primary cultures of estradiol-induced pituitary tumors in Fischer 344 rats. The PRL content of these cells was effectively decreased by cysteamine, with an IC50 of 0.2 mM. Cells previously labeled with [3H]leucine were exposed to cysteamine (0.25 mM), and the intracellular content of [3H]PRL was measured by immunological or nonimmunological means, that is by immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis or by electrophoresis alone. The intracellular concentration of immunoreactive [3H]PRL was reduced by 53% by cysteamine, whereas [3H]PRL quantified by electrophoresis alone was not significantly affected. Our data indicate that cysteamine reduces the PRL content of pituitary tumor cells by causing the loss of its immunoreactivity.
Fetal drug addiction is a serious public health problem. In the United States 10 to 15% of children have been exposed "in utero" to cocaine. In a Chilean public health service, more than 200 offspring of cocaine free base abuser have been detected.
To analyze the clinical and social features of 100 children exposed to cocaine free base during fetal development.
Clinical features of children born from cocaine free base consume mothers were described at birth. During subsequent follow up, growth and development, disease episodes, developmental alterations and social situation were recorded. Data was compared with other newborns from the same health service.
Compared to their normal counterparts, exposed children has a lower birth weight, the frequency of premature babies was thrice higher, and small-for-gestational age children were four times more common. There was also a higher prevalence of cardiac malformations, seizures and apnea. Hospital admissions were more frequent, prolonged and required more complex facilities. During follow up, undernutrition and stunting were more prevalent. Psychomotor retardation was present in 67% of children and behavioral disturbances in 93%. Most of these children are governmental protection.
Strategies to prevent drug abuse during pregnancy and its devastating medical and social consequences should be urgently developed (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128: 1093-1100).
Antrafenine, a new non-narcotic analgesic, has been compared at a dose of 600 mg/day to naproxen 500 mg/day and placebo in a double blind three way cross-over study on 36 patients with osteoarthrosis of the hip and/or knee. There was significant improvement with both active drugs. There was no significant difference between the two active drugs. Patients' preference at the end of the study was antrafenine 7, naproxen 10, placebo 2, no preference 9.3 patients withdrew because of concomitant illness; 2 patients withdrew because of lack of efficacy in the placebo period; 3 patients failed to attend clinic. Antrafenine is more efficacious than placebo in the treatment of osteoarthrosis of the hip and/or knee, and at the doses tested, is of comparable potency to naproxen.
We retrospectively identified 49 cases of recreational drug-induced seizures in 47 patients seen at the San Francisco General Hospital between 1975 and 1987. Most patients experienced a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure associated with acute drug intoxication, but 7 patients had multiple seizures and 2 patients developed status epilepticus. The recreational drugs implicated were cocaine (32 cases), amphetamine (11), heroin (7), and phencyclidine (4). A combination of drugs was responsible in 11 cases. Seizures occurred independent of the route of administration, and occurred in both first-time and chronic abusers. Ten patients (21%) reported having had prior seizures, all with a close temporal association with drug abuse. Other than 1 patient who developed prolonged status epilepticus that caused a fixed neurologic deficit, most patients had no obvious short-term neurologic sequelae.
Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, MeA alpha C, A alpha C, Glu-P-1, Glu-P-2, Lys-P-1, IQ and Phe-P-1 were tested for tumour initiating activity in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis model using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as the promoter. The total initiating doses were 20 mg for Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2, 40 mg for MeA alpha C and A alpha C, 5 mg for Lys-P-1, 7.5 mg for IQ and 100 mg for Phe-P-1. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene was used as a positive control compound at a total dose of 100 micrograms. All compounds were topically applied twice weekly for 5 weeks on the dorsal skin, and then followed by similar TPA administration for 47 weeks. Trp-P-2 induced skin tumours in 30% of the mice (0.35 tumours/mouse), and Trp-P-1, MeA alpha C and Phe-P-1 in 10-20% (0.20-0.25 tumours/mouse). The smaller amounts of Lys-P-1 and IQ applied induced tumours at an incidence of 10 and 5% respectively. No tumours appeared in the groups treated with test chemicals alone or TPA alone. Statistical analysis according to either the Fisher exact test or Peto trend test revealed significant differences for tumour appearance in the Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, MeA alpha C and Phe-P-1 followed by TPA groups as compared with that given TPA alone. The data were used to generate ID50 (50% initiating dose) values for each of the compounds.
Many studies have suggested the importance of the rate of drug elimination in the development of pharmacodynamic tolerance and physical dependence to sedative-hypnotics. However, these studies usually compared drugs whose pharmacokinetic properties differed widely, e.g., short- vs. long-acting barbiturates. Accordingly, we investigated the relationship between individual variations in the rate of elimination of a single drug, pentobarbital, and the severity of physical dependence which developed during chronic pentobarbital administration. Animals were treated with Na pentobarbital according to the "maximally tolerable" dosing schedule described previously, twice a day for 35 days, and abruptly withdrawn. The relationship between chronic treatment variables (doses and blood concentrations of pentobarbital, peak and residual central nervous system depression scores), elimination half-lives and withdrawal intensity were explored. Withdrawal intensity was evaluated as overall withdrawal intensity ratings, the number and types of spontaneous withdrawal convulsions and lethality. Individual variations in the drug elimination half-lives related significantly to the severity of physical dependence produced by pentobarbital: the longer half-life, the more intense the production of physical dependence by pentobarbital.
Although the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved substantially in the past three decades, more than half of all patients develop disease that is refractory to intensive chemotherapy. Functional genomics approaches offer a means to discover specific molecules mediating the aberrant growth and survival of cancer cells. Thus, using a loss-of-function RNA interference genomic screen, we identified the aberrant expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a crucial element in AML pathogenesis. We found HGF expression leading to autocrine activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, MET, in nearly half of the AML cell lines and clinical samples we studied. Genetic depletion of HGF or MET potently inhibited the growth and survival of HGF-expressing AML cells. However, leukemic cells treated with the specific MET kinase inhibitor crizotinib developed resistance resulting from compensatory upregulation of HGF expression, leading to the restoration of MET signaling. In cases of AML where MET is coactivated with other tyrosine kinases, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), concomitant inhibition of FGFR1 and MET blocked this compensatory HGF upregulation, resulting in sustained logarithmic cell killing both in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Our results show a widespread dependence of AML cells on autocrine activation of MET, as well as the key role of compensatory upregulation of HGF expression in maintaining leukemogenic signaling by this receptor. We anticipate that these findings will lead to the design of additional strategies to block adaptive cellular responses that drive compensatory ligand expression as an essential component of the targeted inhibition of oncogenic receptors in human cancers.
Heparinassociated thrombocytopenia has been reported for over 35 years. This reaction can result in serious thromboembolic complications. The primary mechanism responsible for this reaction is thought to be an immunologic process. The author reports a severe thrombocytopenia, acute thrombotic occlusion of the leg, acute aortal thrombosis, deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli occurred simultaneously in a 75-year-old woman within 11 days of starting a subcutaneous low-dose heparin prophylaxis.
Due to pain from infected 12 per cent TBSA flame injuries a 71-year-old female was treated with a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (diclofenac), thereby inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, and developed transient impairment of renal function. This case report indicates that prostaglandins may be required to modulate the late responses after burns or other major trauma, especially when infected.
Stereotaxically placed intracerebral microinjections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) were used to produce selective and extensive lesions of either the dopaminergic nigro-neostriatal bundle or the dorsal and ventral noradrenergic projections in the rat. The extensive damage of the noradrenergic pathways which is typically obtained after intranigral 6-OHDA injections was completely prevented by pretreatment with desipramine. Extensive depletions (85-95%) of norepinephrine (NE) in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortices and hippocampi failed to influence either spontaneous or D-amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Neither the time course of the amphetamine response as measured by photocell cages nor the qualitative nature of the response as determined by direct observation was significantly altered by these lesions. In contrast, selective depletion (92%) of neostriatal dopamine (DA) after intranigral 6-OHDA injections severly reduced but did not abolish amphetamine-induced hyperkinesia. At the highest dose studied (2.0 mg/kg) these animals showed an initial increase in activity but, unlike controls, failed to maintain this level. This response was probably mediated by the small remaining stores of DA in the neostriatum. Pimozide (0.5 mg/kg) also severely attenuated but did not abolish amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. These data are consistent with the view that ascending DA projections are a critical substrate for amphetamine-induced hyperkinesia. They furthermore suggest that ascending NE systems do not play a role in this response.
We describe two patients with unusual neuro-ophthalmologic complications during long-term therapy with lithium carbonate given for bipolar affective disorder, "benign" intracranial hypertension in one, and downbeat nystagmus, with oscillopsia in the other. A review of the literature is proposed. Though rare, such neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations are worth being recognised since they usually disappear with cessation--when possible--of lithium therapy.
Tenofovir-related tubule damage characterized by Fanconi syndrome, renal insufficiency and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has been reported in the adult HIV-infected population. To our knowledge there has been no reported case of such complications in the pediatric population. We report the case of a 12-year-old perinatally HIV-infected African-American girl who developed nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency and Fanconi-like syndrome while taking tenofovir (Viread) in combination with lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra) and didanosine (Videx).
As many as 45% of patients with major depressive episode also meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar II (BP II) disorder. Although some clinicians advocate using a mood stabilizer in treating BP II depression, antidepressant monotherapy has been less well studied in this disorder. As part of a prospective, placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention study in 839 patients, the efficacy and safety of short- and long-term fluoxetine treatment in patients with BP II major depression compared with patients with unipolar (UP) major depression was retrospectively examined. Eighty-nine BP II patients (mean age, 41+/-11 years) were compared with 89 age- and gender-matched UP patients and with 661 unmatched UP patients (mean age, 39+/-11 years). All received short-term fluoxetine therapy at 20 mg daily for up to 12 weeks. Complete remission was defined as a final Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score < or = 7 by week 9 that was then maintained for 3 additional weeks. Remitted patients were then randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with one of the following: (1) fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 52 weeks; (2) fluoxetine for 38 weeks, then placebo for 14 weeks; (3) fluoxetine for 14 weeks, then placebo for 38 weeks; or (4) placebo for 52 weeks. Antidepressant efficacy was similar in BP and UP patients during short-term therapy. Discontinuation for lack of efficacy was lower in BP II (5%) than in UP (12%) patients (p = not significant [NS]), whereas dropouts for adverse events were similar in BP II (11%) and UP (9%) patients. During long-term relapse-prevention therapy, relapse rates were similar in BP II and UP patients (p = NS). During short-term fluoxetine therapy, three BP II (3.8%) versus no matched UP (p = NS) and 0.3% unmatched UP (p = 0.01) patients had a "manic switch." During long-term fluoxetine therapy, one (2%) BP II and three (1%) unmatched UP patients (one taking placebo) had a manic switch (p = NS). In conclusion, fluoxetine may be a safe and effective antidepressant monotherapy for the short-term treatment of BP II depression with a relatively low manic switch rate. Fluoxetine may also be effective in relapse-prevention therapy in patients with BP II disorder.
Breast cancer patients are at increased risk of osteoporosis. Contributing factors include age and/or chemotherapy. The selective estrogen modulator, raloxifene (RAL), effective in the prevention of breast cancer and approved for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, may prove beneficial in current breast cancer treatment modules. The purpose of this study was to evaluate RAL in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and trimetrexate (TMX) to determine the most effective sequence in which to administer these cell cycle specific agents while taking into consideration the cellular mechanism of action. The goal was to maintain cytotoxicity to breast cancer cells and capitalize on the selective estrogen receptor modulatory effects of RAL.
MCF-7 cells were exposed to (i) TMX, 5-FU or RAL alone, or (ii) RAL 24 h prior to 5-FU followed 2 h later by TMX, or (iii) 5-FU 2 h prior to TMX followed 24 h later by RAL. The cell viability was determined using the Quick Cell Proliferation Assay.
The growth rate of MCF- 7 cells exposed to early RAL was 68.25 +/- 4.11% that of the control, however, late RAL exposure produced a growth of 34.75 +/- 4.79% that of the control. Late RAL maintained the cytotoxicity of the regimen. The findings were further supported by cell flow cytometry and Western blot analysis data.
RAL given prior to 5-FU/TMX significantly compromised cytotoxicity to breast cancer cells.
To assess the diagnostic value and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in patients with coma of unclear origin with suspected poisoning.
Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised study.
Intensive care unit at a major teaching hospital.
105 Unconscious adults admitted consecutively with suspected drug overdosage during 18 months from a total of 362 cases of poisoning. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, epilepsy, obvious poisoning with drugs identified unequivocally from information from relatives or others as other than benzodiazepines, and coma score greater than 10 on a scale graded from 4 to 20. Patients were allocated randomly to receive flumazenil (21 men and 32 women) or placebo (25 men and 27 women).
Intravenous injection of flumazenil (10 ml, 0.1 mg/ml) or placebo (10 ml vehicle alone) given double blind over three minutes.
Serum and urine concentrations of benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and several other agents; blood gas tensions; standardised evaluation on admission and five minutes after the injection by means of coma scale score and urgent diagnostic or therapeutic interventions indicated according to the history and clinical examination; standardised interview after the injection to try to ascertain further information; and adverse reactions.
Benzodiazepines were found in the serum in 36 of the 53 patients in the flumazenil group and in 37 of the 52 who received placebo. The average coma scale score increased significantly after injection in the flumazenil group (6.4 v 12.1, p less than 0.001) but not in the placebo group. In the flumazenil group several interventions were rendered unnecessary by the injection: gastric lavage and urinary catheterisation (19 patients each), intubation (21), artificial ventilation and computed tomography of the brain (three patients each), blood culture and lumbar puncture (one patient each), and electroencephalography (two). In the placebo group the indications for these procedures did not change in any patient after injection. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in reduction of the frequency of indications for gastric lavage after injection between the two groups was 21% to 51%, that for intubation 25% to 55%, and that for urinary catheterisation 21% to 51%. In the flumazenil group 21 patients gave valuable information on their drug ingestion within 10 minutes after injection compared with only one in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). Nine adverse reactions were recorded in the flumazenil group, eight of which were graded as mild and one severe. The safety of the antagonist was acceptable, even though 60% of the patients in the flumazenil group had multiple drug poisoning including benzodiazepine. No epileptic seizures or arrhythmias were recorded.
Flumazenil is a valuable and safe differential diagnostic tool in unclear cases of multiple drug poisoning.
NO2)is a major urban air pollutant. Previously reported associations between ambient NO2)and children's respiratory health have been inconsistent, and independent effects of correlated pollutants hard to assess. The authors examined effects of NO2 on a spectrum of 11 respiratory symptoms, controlling for PM10 and SO2, using a large pooled dataset.
Cross sectional studies were conducted in Russia, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, during 1993-99, contributing in total 23 955 children. Study-specific odds ratios for associations with ambient NO2 are estimated using logistic regressions with area-level random effects. Heterogeneity between study-specific results, and mean estimates (allowing for heterogeneity) are calculated.
Long term average NO2 concentrations were unrelated to prevalences of bronchitis or asthma. Associations were found for sensitivity to inhaled allergens and allergy to pets, with mean odds ratios around 1.14 per 10 microg/m3 NO2. SO2 had little confounding effect, but an initial association between NO2 and morning cough was reduced after controlling for PM10. Associations with reported allergy were not reduced by adjustment for the other pollutants. Odds ratios for allergic symptoms tended to be higher for the 9-12 year old children compared with the 6-8 year old children.
Evidence for associations between NO2 and respiratory symptoms was robust only for inhalation allergies. NO2 most likely is acting as an indicator of traffic related air pollutants, though its direct effect cannot be ruled out. This remains important, as policies to reduce traffic related air pollution will not result in rapid reductions.
