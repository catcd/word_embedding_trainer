Experimental models and clinical data indicate that the incidence of motor and learning disorders may be increased in children of epileptic mothers taking phenytoin (PHT) during pregnancy. There is little data on the vulnerability of infants to PHT-induced long-term behavioral toxicity after gestational or early life exposure (i.e., infantile convulsion therapy). We examined the persistence of alterations in circling behavior induced by exposure to PHT during gestation, infancy, or both. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected i.p. with saline (SAL) or PHT (30 mg/kg/day) during gestational days (GD) 10-18. The offspring were then administered (i.p.) SAL or PHT (60 mg/kg/day) during postnatal days (PD) 13-23. Afterward, Circling Training tests were performed at three time points. At PD40 and PD80, the clockwise direction of circling was reinforced. At PD150, counterclockwise circling was rewarded instead. At PD40, all PHT-treated groups demonstrated increased circling velocities compared to saline-treated controls. Higher spatial error rates for direction of circling were also observed in gestation-only and infancy-only exposures. At PD80, groups exposed during gestation had higher circling velocities than control or infancy-only exposed groups. At PD150, increases in circling velocity were apparent for the reverse learning task in groups exposed during gestation. These results indicate that early postnatal exposure to PHT may exacerbate the known long-term behavioral effects of gestational exposure.
A population of New Zealand White rabbits exhibit behavioral convulsions when given low doses of psychoactive cannabinoids of marijuana. Carbamazepine, diazepam and phenytoin were most effective in blocking these convulsions caused by delta9tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9THC). Phenobarbital and ethosuximide also blocked convulsions but only at toxic doses. Cannabidiol was effective in blocking convulsions when given concurrently with, but not prior to delta9THC.
Studies in children suggest a weak association between blood lead concentration and blood pressure. To understand this better, we tested the strength of the association in children with elevated blood lead concentrations and whether succimer chelation changed blood pressure as it did blood lead. In a randomized clinical trial of 780 children with blood lead concentrations of 20-44 microg/dL at 12-33 months of age, we compared the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the succimer-treated group and placebo group for up to 5 years of follow-up. We also analyzed the relation of blood lead to blood pressure. Children in the succimer group had lower blood lead concentrations for 9-10 months during and after treatment, but their blood pressure did not differ from those in the placebo group during this period. During 1-5 years of follow-up, children in the succimer group had systolic blood pressure 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 0.27-1.90) mmHg higher than did untreated children in a model with repeated measurements, but the difference in diastolic blood pressure was not statistically significant. No association between blood lead and blood pressure was found. Overall, there is no association between blood lead and blood pressure in these children with moderately high lead exposure, nor does chelation with succimer change blood pressure.
Biochemical (myocardial DNA, RNA, and hydroxyproline) and humoral (plasma [PRA] and kidney [KRA] renin activity) factors were determined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar controls (NR) before and following treatment with minoxidil or propranolol. Minoxidil (150 mg.litre-1 drinking water) effectively controlled blood pressure (17.3 kPa vs 24.9 kPa [130 mmHg vs 187 mmHg], P less than 0.001) despite marked and sustained increases in both PRA and KRA ventricular weight which were not reduced and myocardial DNA, RNA, and hyperdroxyproline which were increased by minoxidil (P less than 0.01). In contrast propranolol did not reduce blood pressure in SHR but ventricular weight was reduced somewhat (3.1 +/- 0.4 mg.g-1 vs 3.4 +/- 0.09 mg.g-1, P less than 0.05); in both SHR and NR, KRA, and PRA were lowered by pranolol. Methyldopa which controlled blood pressure and lowered PRA led to a reversal of hypertrophy. Thus, although blood pressure control is obviously important for reversing cardiac hypertrophy, it may not be the sole factor for the development and reversal of cardiac hypertrophy.
The American Food and Drug Administration has suggested that proton pump inhibitors increase the international normalized ratio (INR) when used concomitantly with warfarin, by being metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C19. We therefore reviewed patients taking warfarin.
Two hundred and forty patients who took warfarin after surgery were divided into two groups: Group I (n = 114) had rabeprazole (10 mg/day) and Group II (n = 126) had lansoprazole (15 mg/day). The initial dose of warfarin was 3 mg and INR was initially assessed on postoperative day 4. Initial INR was significantly lower in Group I (1.66 +/- 0.87) than in Group II (2.06 +/- 1.03, P = 0.0011). Delayed cardiac tamponade and hemothorax occurred as complications in 6 and 1 patients, respectively, in Group II from 5 days to 3 months postoperatively. At the time of the occurrence of complications, the average INR increased to 3.95 (range from 3.11 to 5.86). There were no patients with delayed bleeding in Group I ( P = 0.015).
These results suggest that lansoprazole emphasizes the effects of warfarin. Rabeprazole could be safely used concomitantly with warfarin.
Two patients, aged 24 and 19 years, who had undifferentiated lymphoma, developed the acute onset of focal neurologic deficits 10 days after treatment with moderate-dose methotrexate (2.76 g/m2 by 42-hour intravenous infusion) and 12.5 mg of intrathecal methotrexate. Prior chemotherapy also included intravenous cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, oral prednisone, and intrathecal cytosine arabinoside. Dysarthria with left hemiparesis was noted in one patient and inability to speak and quadriparesis in the other. Cerebrospinal fluid and cranial computerized tomography results were normal; however, EEGs showed focal abnormalities in both patients. Full neurologic recovery occurred within 48 hours. These symptoms developed early in the course of treatment and have not recurred in one patient who continued to receive the same regimen. The mechanism for this neurologic dysfunction is unclear. A similar picture has been reported in patients receiving high-dose methotrexate (8-10 g/m2) for osteogenic sarcoma.
The model of chronic dermatitis caused by repeated application of hapten is frequently used as a tool for assessment of the efficacy of a compound or the elucidation of chronic dermatitis.
The purpose of this study is to provide more detailed analysis of the model of chronic dermatitis caused by repeated application of 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB).
BALB/c mice were sensitized with TNCB on day -7 to the ear, and then TNCB was repeatedly applied to the same ear three times per week, through days 0-21.
The repeated application of TNCB induced an increase of ear thickness, and a relatively steep increment of ear thickness from days 7 to 9 was observed. This increment reached almost a plateau at day 9. The peaks of ear swelling on days 7, 14 and 21 were approximately two times higher than that on day 0. Regarding cytokines in the ear, the highest production of IL-1 beta, 4, 6 and 18 were observed on day 7. The peak production of IL-1 beta, 4 and 6 on day 7 was found within 24 h after the challenge, while that of IL-18 was found at 0 h. The inflammatory cell infiltration into epidermis and dermis was observed and increased in day 7, then reached almost a plateau on day 9.
The indices such as thickness, swelling and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lesional skin was increased and maintained by repeated application, however, the protein levels of some cytokines were not always consistent with the reactions.
Neurofibomatosis (NF1) patients are susceptible to multiple tumors of the nervous system including neurofibromas, optic glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and astrocytoma. The Nf1+/-;Trp53+/- (NPcis) mouse model of NF1 spontaneously develops astrocytoma and MPNSTs that are very similar to human NF1 tumors. To use this model for testing potential therapeutics, we have developed systems that take advantage of bioluminescent reporters of tumor growth. We have generated E2F1 promoter-driving luciferase (ELUX) reporter mice to detect proliferating tumors in NPcis mice in vivo using bioluminescence. The power of this system is that it enables looking at tumor evolution and detecting spontaneous tumors at early stages of development as they evolve within their natural haploinsufficient microenvironment. This system can be used to identify tumors at different stages of tumorigenesis and to examine where spontaneous NF1 tumors initiate. The ability to rapidly screen multiple animals at a time increases the potential for use of this model in preclinical trials. This model will be valuable for the characterization of spontaneous NF1 tumors and will be important for studying the treatment and prevention of NF1 tumors in vivo.
Insomnia and major depressive disorder (MDD) may coexist. This study evaluated hypnotic discontinuation effects following an 8-week placebo-controlled study of eszopiclone/fluoxetine cotherapy in patients with insomnia and comorbid MDD.
Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD and insomnia received fluoxetine each morning for 8 weeks and were randomized to concomitant treatment with nightly eszopiclone 3 mg (cotherapy) or placebo (monotherapy). Thereafter, patients received 2 weeks of continued fluoxetine plus single-blind placebo.
Incidence rates of central nervous system (CNS) and potentially CNS-related adverse events (AEs) during the run-out period were similar between treatment groups (8.8% with monotherapy vs 9.8% with cotherapy), and there was no evidence of benzodiazepine withdrawal AEs. Physician-assessed Clinical Global Impression improvements in depressive symptoms were maintained after eszopiclone discontinuation. Improvements in 17-item Hamilton-Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) scores with cotherapy versus monotherapy seen at Week 8 (p = .0004) were maintained at Week 10 (p < .0001) and significantly higher depression response and remission rates were observed after cotherapy at Week 10 (p < .02). Patients discontinued from eszopiclone maintained improvements in SL (sleep latency), WASO (wake after sleep onset), and TST (total sleep time) during the 2 weeks following discontinuation (p < .05).
In this study, eszopiclone discontinuation did not result in significant CNS or benzodiazepine withdrawal AEs, rebound insomnia, or rebound depression; and improvements in sleep and depressive symptoms were maintained.
Substantial data from clinical trials and epidemiological studies show promising results for use of statins in many cancers, including mammary carcinoma. Breast tumor primarily metastasizes to bone to form osteolytic lesions, causing severe pain and pathological fracture. Here, we report that simvastatin acts as an inhibitor of osteolysis in a mouse model of breast cancer skeletal metastasis of human mammary cancer cell MDA-MB-231, which expresses the mutant p53R280K. Simvastatin and lovastatin attenuated migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 breast tumor cells in culture. Acquisition of phenotype to express the cancer stem cell marker, CD44, leads to invasive potential of the tumor cells. Interestingly, statins significantly decreased the expression of CD44 protein via a transcriptional mechanism. shRNA-mediated down-regulation of CD44 markedly reduced the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in culture. We identified that in the MDA-MB-231 cells, simvastatin elevated the levels of mutated p53R280K, which was remarkably active as a transcription factor. shRNA-derived inhibition of mutant p53R280K augmented the expression of CD44, leading to increased migration and invasion. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse correlation between expression of p53 and CD44 in the tumors of mice that received simvastatin. Our results reveal a unique function of statins, which foster enhanced expression of mutant p53R280K to prevent breast cancer cell metastasis to bone.
We report a case of a 16-year-old female patient with sickle-cell disease with a liver abscess secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She had initially presented with jaundice and abdominal pain and subsequently underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy for removal of gallstones. However, post-cholecystectomy she presented with generalized abdominal pain and computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a liver abscess. A pigtail catheter was inserted into the abscess and culture of the aspirate yielded MRSA (susceptibility pattern of the organism was compatible with community-acquired MRSA). She was treated with intravenous clindamycin for 6 weeks with complete resolution of the abscess.
Foscarnet is an antiviral agent widely used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. We describe a cardiac transplant patient, who while being maintained with hemodialysis because of tobramycin-induced acute renal failure, was given Foscarnet for disseminated CMV infection. Using dialysate-side clearance methodology, we found the dialyzer clearance of Foscarnet to be in the order of 89 ml/min.
To determine the risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in African Americans aged 18 to 45 years. African Americans are at a higher risk for ICH than Whites, particularly in the younger age groups. However, few data are available regarding the factors that contribute to the high risk of ICH among younger African Americans.
A case-control study.
A university-affiliated public hospital.
One hundred and twenty-two African-American patients admitted with non-traumatic ICH to Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta, Ga.) and 366 age- and sex matched African-American controls selected from a nationally representative sample of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population.
Association between ICH and various demographic and clinical factors determined by stepwise logistic regression.
Cocaine use (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.3-11.8), hypertension (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.2-8.7) and alcohol use (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3) were independently associated with increased risk for ICH.
Cocaine use, hypertension and alcohol use contributed to the high risk of ICH observed in younger African Americans. Primary preventive strategies are required to reduce the high frequency of modifiable risk factors predisposing younger African Americans to ICH.
Numerous case series have implicated cocaine use as a cause of both myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke on the basis of the temporal relationship between drug use and event onset. Increasing cocaine use in the US population, especially in younger individuals, mandates a more extensive investigation of this relationship.
We determined the association of cocaine use with self-reported physician diagnosis of MI or stroke in a nationally representative sample of 10 085 US adults aged 18 to 45 years who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A total of 46 nonfatal MIs and 33 nonfatal strokes were reported. After adjusting for differences in age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cholesterol level, body mass index, and cigarette smoking, persons who reported frequent lifetime cocaine use had a significantly higher likelihood of nonfatal MI than nonusers (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 58) but not stroke. In this age group, the population-attributable risk percent of frequent cocaine for nonfatal MI was estimated as 25%.
Regular cocaine use was associated with an increased likelihood of MI in younger patients. Approximately 1 of every 4 nonfatal MIs in persons aged 18 to 45 years was attributable to frequent cocaine use in this survey. Behavior modification by public awareness and education may reduce the cardiovascular morbidity associated with cocaine use.
The long-acting somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995 has been used efficaciously in the therapy of metastatic carcinoid tumor, vasoactive intestinal peptide producing islet cell carcinoma, acromegaly, and TSH secreting pituitary tumors. We report the development of a gallstone in a patient treated for 23 months with a long acting somatostatin analogue for a metastatic carcinoid tumor. Symptomatic improvement and a reduction in the urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid occurred. There was no evidence of a gallstone on ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen prior to somatostatin therapy. A progressively enlarging, asymptomatic gallstone developed during therapy.
Recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) donors can trigger apoptosis of neurons, and growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can protect against NO-induced neuronal cell death. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the possible mechanisms of NO-mediated neuronal apoptosis and the neuroprotective action of these growth factors. Both IGF-1 and bFGF prevented apoptosis induced by NO donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or 3-morpholinosydnonimin (SIN-1) in hippocampal neuronal cultures. Incubation of neurons with SNP induced caspase-3-like activation following downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax protein levels in cultured neurons. Treatment of neurons with a bax antisense oligonucleotide inhibited the caspase-3-like activation and neuronal death induced by SNP. In addition, treatment of neurons with an inhibitor of caspase-3, Ac-DEVD-CHO, together with SNP did not affect the changes in the protein levels, although it inhibited NO-induced cell death. Pretreatment of cultures with either IGF-1 or bFGF prior to NO exposure inhibited caspase-3-like activation together with the changes in Bcl-2 and Bax protein levels. These results suggest that the changes in Bcl-2 and Bax protein levels followed by caspase-3-like activation are a component in the cascade of NO-induced neuronal apoptosis, and that the neuroprotective actions of IGF-1 and bFGF might be due to inhibition of the changes in the protein levels of the Bcl-2 family.
We report the case of a woman who developed subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) after exposure to the sun while taking cinnarizine and thiethylperazine. The patient recalled that 10 years previously, a similar eruption had appeared after sunbathing, while she was taking only cinnarizine. SCLE development in this patient was probably drug related and there is some evidence that cinnarizine played an important pathogenic role.
Heroin (diamorphine) is a highly addictive opiate with potential for misuse. A small number of reports have linked the commencement of heroin misuse to acute exotropia with diplopia and subsequent withdrawal to esotropia in individuals without previous symptoms.(1-5) We describe a young adult who sought strabismus surgery to correct a large-angle exotropia. Detailed patient history and orthoptic measurements at different times of the day revealed a fluctuating angle of divergence relating to the timing of opiate ingestion, rendering surgery inappropriate. We suggest that opiate misuse, which may not willingly be disclosed by patients, should be specifically asked about before acquired-strabismus surgery is undertaken in adults.
Adherence to ribavirin is one factor that is critically important in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. However, ribavirin can be associated with clinically significant hemolytic anemia resulting in dose modifications in up to one-quarter of patients. Currently, baseline predictors of considerable anemia are not sufficiently discriminating for routine therapeutic intervention. The objective of this analysis was to elucidate baseline and on-treatment factors predictive of a considerable hemoglobin drop at week 4.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore possible predictors for considerable hemoglobin decline (> or =2.5 g/dL) at week 4 among patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) and ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day).
A total of 555 patients were included in this analysis. At week 4, 236 patients exhibited a > or =2.5 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. By regression analysis the most important independent variables associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of > or =2.5 g/dL were baseline creatinine clearance (P= 0.0003) and a rapid decline in hemoglobin of > or =1.5 g/dL at week 2 (P < 0.0001). Considerable hemoglobin decreases at week 4 were also significantly associated with early ribavirin dose reductions and a lower cumulative daily dose of ribavirin.
Patients with impaired renal function may be at an increased risk of ribavirin-related anemia and should be monitored accordingly. Furthermore, a hemoglobin drop of > or =1.5 g/dL by week 2 was an excellent early predictor for subsequent considerable hemoglobin decreases and might be used to identify candidates for early intervention against anemia in order to help maintain ribavirin dosing and avoid suboptimal exposure.
Phospholipidosis is a lipid storage disorder in which excess phospholipids accumulate within cells. Some cationic amphiphilic compounds are known to have the potential to induce phospholipidosis. This study was undertaken to examine the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of phospholipidosis and to identify specific markers that might form the basis of an in vitro screening test. Specifically, we performed a large-scale gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays on human hepatoma HepG2 cells after they were treated with each of 12 compounds known to induce phospholipidosis. In electron microscopy, HepG2 cells developed lamellar myelin-like bodies in their lysosomes, the characteristic change of phospholipidosis, after treatment with these compounds for 72 h. DNA microarray analysis performed 6 and 24 h after treatment showed alterations in gene expression reflecting the inhibition of lysosomal phospholipase activity and lysosomal enzyme transport, and the induction of phospholipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Seventeen genes that showed a similar expression profile following treatment were selected as candidate markers. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that 12 gene markers showed significant concordance with lamellar myelin-like body formation. Furthermore, the average fold change values of these markers correlated well with the magnitude of this pathological change. In conclusion, microarray analysis revealed that factors such as alterations in lysosomal function and cholesterol metabolism were involved in the induction of phospholipidosis. Furthermore, comprehensive gene expression analysis enabled us to identify biomarkers of this condition that we then used to develop a rapid and sensitive in vitro screening test for drug-induced phospholipidosis.
The catatonogenic action of haloperidol in rats was assessed through different experimental procedures. In the first experiment the animals were injected intraperitoneally with haloperidol, 0.4-4.0 mg/kg, and then divided into two subgroups. The first group was tested for catatonic behavior from 20 min up to 4 h after the injection, while the second was only tested throughout the last 3- to 4-hour period. In the second experiment, animals received, either 0.2 or 0.6 mg haloperidol/kg 3 times at 15-day intervals, and were tested for catatonic behavior from 20 to 240 min after the injection. 15 days after the last drug session, the same animals were injected with distilled water and then tested for catatonia. The results showed that retesting drastically influenced the amount of catatonic behavior and that, when under no drug, the rats still displayed catatonia. The data suggest a learning component of this behavior.
To explore the contribution of functional coding variants to psoriasis, we analyzed nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the genome by exome sequencing in 781 psoriasis cases and 676 controls and through follow-up validation in 1,326 candidate genes by targeted sequencing in 9,946 psoriasis cases and 9,906 controls from the Chinese population. We discovered two independent missense SNVs in IL23R and GJB2 of low frequency and five common missense SNVs in LCE3D, ERAP1, CARD14 and ZNF816A associated with psoriasis at genome-wide significance. Rare missense SNVs in FUT2 and TARBP1 were also observed with suggestive evidence of association. Single-variant and gene-based association analyses of nonsynonymous SNVs did not identify newly associated genes for psoriasis in the regions subjected to targeted resequencing. This suggests that coding variants in the 1,326 targeted genes contribute only a limited fraction of the overall genetic risk for psoriasis.
We treated two patients with Crohn's disease and one patient with ulcerative colitis who developed headache, papilledema, and intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) during corticosteroid withdrawal. One had four separate episodes with corticosteroid withdrawal, which suggested a causal relationship. This association between pseudotumor cerebri and corticosteroid withdrawal has been documented in children, but is rare in adults with inflammatory bowel disease.
The contribution of cis-regulatory mutations to human disease remains poorly understood. Whole-genome sequencing can identify all noncoding variants, yet the discrimination of causal regulatory mutations represents a formidable challenge. We used epigenomic annotation in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived pancreatic progenitor cells to guide the interpretation of whole-genome sequences from individuals with isolated pancreatic agenesis. This analysis uncovered six different recessive mutations in a previously uncharacterized ~400-bp sequence located 25 kb downstream of PTF1A (encoding pancreas-specific transcription factor 1a) in ten families with pancreatic agenesis. We show that this region acts as a developmental enhancer of PTF1A and that the mutations abolish enhancer activity. These mutations are the most common cause of isolated pancreatic agenesis. Integrating genome sequencing and epigenomic annotation in a disease-relevant cell type can thus uncover new noncoding elements underlying human development and disease.
