Perlecan is a large heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan present in all basement membranes and in some other tissues such as cartilage, and is implicated in cell growth and differentiation. Mice lacking the perlecan gene (Hspg2) have a severe chondrodysplasia with dyssegmental ossification of the spine and show radiographic, clinical and chondro-osseous morphology similar to a lethal autosomal recessive disorder in humans termed dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH; MIM 224410). Here we report a homozygous, 89-bp duplication in exon 34 of HSPG2 in a pair of siblings with DDSH born to consanguineous parents, and heterozygous point mutations in the 5' donor site of intron 52 and in the middle of exon 73 in a third, unrelated patient, causing skipping of the entire exons 52 and 73 of the HSPG2 transcript, respectively. These mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein core. The cartilage matrix from these patients stained poorly with antibody specific for perlecan, but there was staining of intracellular inclusion bodies. Biochemically, truncated perlecan was not secreted by the patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller fragments within the cells. Thus, DDSH is caused by a functional null mutation of HSPG2. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of perlecan in cartilage development.
A young man receiving high dose cytosine arabinoside (3g/m2 every 12 hours) for promyelocytic leukemia developed rapidly increasing hyperbilirubinemia and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient had been treated previously with courses of standard dose cytosine arabinoside without hepatic or renal complications. His condition rapidly deteriorated, and he required hemodialysis. The total bilirubin increased to 45.4 mg/dL, but alkaline phosphatase remained normal. Twelve days after starting chemotherapy, the patient died of hepatorenal failure. Liver necropsy revealed mild bile stasis and microvesicular steatosis. We suspect high dose cytosine arabinoside played a major role in causing impairment of bilirubin transport within the hepatocyte in this patient.
Thirty-eight patients with cancer of the prostate were treated with strict parenteral estrogen in the form of monthly polyestradiol phosphate injections--160 mg, 240 mg, and 320 mg--in this nonrandomized study. In contrast to studies with oral estrogens, there have been no cardiovascular complications at a mean follow-up of 12.9 +/- 0.7 months (SEM). Twenty-nine of the 38 patients (76%) have responded to therapy.
When cisplatin is administered in the form of a cisplatin-methionine substitution complex, high doses of cisplatin can be tolerated with no obvious signs of renal toxicity. We have demonstrated that male Wistar rats receiving a single i.p. dose of cisplatin-methionine at a 1:5 ratio (by weight) did not exhibit cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, while cisplatin administered alone at an identical concentration (6 mg/kg) resulted in marked renal toxicity in all animals treated. Using renal cortical slices prepared from untreated rats, we demonstrated that cisplatin, but not cisplatin-methionine, inhibited the accumulation of 14C-tetraethylammonium (TEA). This observation suggests that cisplatin, unlike cisplatin-methionine, is a substrate for the organic base transport system. In addition, cisplatin alone was more cytotoxic to C6 glioma cells in vitro than the cisplatin-methionine complex. Exposure of C6 glioma cells to cisplatin-methionine, however, resulted in a 50%-60% reduction in 3H-thymidine incorporation at cisplatin:methionine ratios up to 1:10. These results indicate that cisplatin-methionine is significantly cytotoxic yet lacks cisplatin-associated renal toxicity and may, therefore, have a role in the treatment of human malignancies.
To evaluate the consumption and safety of H(2)-receptor antagonists after switching ranitidine and famotidine to over-the-counter (OTC) status.
The Finnish drug consumption data, based on the sales of medicines, and the national register for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from 1990 to 2003 were used. We studied the consumption of H(2)-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate and antacids (A02BA, A02BC, A02BX02 and A02A, respectively, according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] classification). We compared the ADRs of H(2)-receptor antagonists with proton pump inhibitors.
The total consumption of medicines for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease increased more than 2-fold from 1990 to 2003 (from 12.8 daily defined doses [DDD]/1000 inhabitants/day to 29.6 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day). Initially, switching ranitidine and famotidine to OTC status in 1996 increased their consumption. Since 1998, proton pump inhibitors have been the most commonly used drug group for the treatment of peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in Finland. In 2003, the consumption of proton pump inhibitors was 75% (22.2 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day) of the total consumption of drugs for the treatment of peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Switching ranitidine and famotidine to OTC status did not affect the number of reported adverse reactions to these drugs.
According to information collected from the Finnish consumption and ADR databases, H(2)-receptor antagonists are very often used in self-medication and they do not have serious adverse effects. However, the total number of reports concerning these ATC groups in the national ADR database is not very high, and therefore patient-based surveys are needed to verify this finding.
The oral ingestion of soluble nickel compounds leads to neurological symptoms in humans. Deficiencies in aerobic metabolism induced by neurotoxic stimulus can cause an energy crisis in the brain that results in a variety of neurotoxic effects. In the present study, we focused on the aerobic metabolic states to investigate whether disturbance of aerobic metabolism was involved in nickel-induced neurological effects in mice. Mice were orally administered nickel chloride, and neurobehavioral performance was evaluated using the Morris water maze and open field tests at different time points. Aerobic metabolic states in the cerebral cortex were analyzed at the same time points at which neurobehavioral changes were evident. We found that nickel exposure caused deficits in both spatial memory and exploring activity in mice and that nickel was deposited in their cerebral cortex. Deficient aerobic metabolism manifested as decreased O2 consumption and ATP concentrations, lactate and NADH accumulation, and oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the activity of prototypical iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) containing enzymes that are known to control aerobic metabolism, including complex I and aconitase, and the expression of ISC assembly scaffold protein (ISCU) were inhibited following nickel deposition. Overall, these data suggest that aerobic metabolic disturbances, which accompanied the neurobehavioral changes, may participate in nickel-induced neurologic effects. The inactivation of ISC containing metabolic enzymes may result in the disturbance of aerobic metabolism. A better understanding of how nickel impacts the energy metabolic processes may provide insight into the prevention of nickel neurotoxicity.
Lithium intoxication may present as seizures, which have been observed when plasma lithium concentrations were decreasing. The neurotoxic effect of lithium could be due to a rise in intra-/extra-cellular lithium ratio. Intracellular retention of lithium reflected in rapid fall of plasma concentrations during treatment would modify cell membrane properties and increase neuronal excitability. Such a mechanism would explain the occurrence of seizures despite therapeutic plasma lithium concentrations.
A retrospective, multicenter study of 180 children with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency analyzed the clinical features, prognosis, and molecular bases of the COX deficiency. Clinical symptoms including failure to thrive, encephalopathy, hypotony, Leigh syndrome, cardiac involvement, and hepatopathy appeared in most patients early after birth or in early childhood. Two thirds of all children died. Biochemical examination revealed an isolated COX deficiency in 101 children and COX deficiency combined with disturbances of other respiratory chain complexes in 79 children. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactate increased in 85% and 81% of examined cases, respectively. Pathogenic mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA were established in 75 patients. Mutations in surfeit locus protein 1 gene (SURF1) were found in 47 children with Leigh syndrome; 2bp deletion 845-846delCT was found in 89% of independent alleles. Mutations in a mitochondrial copper-binding protein (SCO2) gene were found in nine children with encephalomyopathy and/or cardiomyopathy; all of them were homozygotes or heterozygotes for 1541G>A mutation. Different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion or depletion were found in nine children, mtDNA mutation 3243A>G in six, mtDNA mutation 8363G>A in two children with Leigh syndrome and mtDNA mutations 8344A>G, and 9205-9206delTA in one child each. COX deficiency represents a heterogeneous group of diseases with unfavorable prognosis. Marked prevalence of two nuclear DNA mutations (845-846delCT in the SURF1 gene and 1541G>A in the SCO2 gene) associated with COX deficiency in a Slavonic population suggests the existence of regional differences in the genetic basis of COX deficiency.
It has been suggested that 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 may have a cytoprotective effect in the liver. To assess this hypothesis, we determined the effects of this prostaglandin on the metabolism and toxicity of bromobenzene in mice. Administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (50 micrograms/kg s.c., 30 min before, and every 6 hr after, the administration of bromobenzene) did not modify the disappearance curves of unchanged bromobenzene from plasma and liver, and did not modify the amount of bromobenzene metabolites covalently bound to hepatic proteins 1-24 hr after the administration of a toxic dose of bromobenzene (0.36 ml/kg i.p.). The prostaglandin, however, markedly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase activity, the extent of liver cell necrosis, the depletion of glutathione, and the disappearance of cytochrome P-450 after administration of this toxic dose of bromobenzene (0.36 ml/kg i.p.). It also markedly reduced mortality after administration of a lethal dose of bromobenzene (0.43 ml/kg i.p.). We conclude that 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 can prevent hepatic necrosis without decreasing the covalent binding of bromobenzene metabolites to hepatic proteins. The mechanism for this dissociation between covalent binding and toxicity remains unknown.
Rats' bladders were irrigated with aqueous solutions of chlorhexidine digluconate 1 : 5,000 or 1 : 10,000 for varying periods up to 48 hours. Histologic examination of the bladders showed severe erosive cystitis in a high percentage of cases. It is concluded that chlorhexidine cannot be recommended for prolonged irrigation of the bladder or for instillation during the intermittent catheterisation where chlorhexidine has repeated and prolonged contact with bladder mucosa.
Cocaine addiction in humans is characterized by cycles of abstinence from drug-taking and relapse. Here, electrophysiological recording procedures were used to determine whether nucleus accumbens (Acb) neuronal firing properties are altered following interruption and resumption of cocaine self-administration. Rats (n = 12) were trained to self-administer cocaine (2 h daily sessions) then divided into two groups. Acb activity was recorded for Group 1 (controls) during two additional self-administration sessions completed over the next 2 days (test sessions 1 and 2). Acb activity was recorded for Group 2 (1-month) during one self-administration session completed the next day (test 1), and during a second self-administration session 1 month later (test 2). As in prior reports, a subset of Acb neurons exhibited patterned discharges (short duration and/or long-term cyclic alterations, termed 'phasically active') relative to cocaine-reinforced responding during test session 1. Remarkably, the percentage of phasically active cells dramatically increased (nearly two-fold) following 1-month abstinence, in the core but not the shell of the Acb. Likewise, the strength of the neural correlates (determined via signal-to-baseline ratios) also increased as a function of abstinence. Extinction experiments in another set of rats (n = 12) revealed an increased motivational state for the drug following abstinence. The results show that abstinence from cocaine self-administration causes a dramatic increase in the number and strength of Acb neurons that encode cocaine-related information, thus representing the first neurophysiological correlate of heightened activation of the 'brain reward system' following abstinence and resumption (relapse) of cocaine consumption.
We evaluated the effects of WR-2721 on the toxicity and antitumor activity of the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and carboplatin (CBDCA) in BALB/c and C57B1/6 mice. On a weekly schedule, i.p. injection of 200 mg/kg WR-2721 at 5 min prior to the administration of this combination enabled us to increase the CBDCA dose from a nontoxic level of 45 mg/kg to a normally toxic dose of 60 mg/kg in non-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice while maintaining the 5FU dose at 100 mg/kg. When WR-2721 was given 30 min before this combination, the CBDCA dose could not be increased to 60 mg/kg without producing drug-related deaths. WR-2721 protected against CBDCA- and 5-FU-induced thrombocytopenia but did not prevent leukopenia or anemia in C57B1/6 mice. The antitumor activity of the combination against colon 26 tumors in BALB/c mice was increased by pretreatment with WR-2721, which facilitated elevation of the CBDCA dose to 60 mg/kg in combination with 100 mg/kg 5FU. These results reveal better therapeutic efficacy for the combination of 5FU and CBDCA following pretreatment with WR-2721.
A combination chemotherapy program using methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (M-BACOD), which resulted in a high complete response rate and prolonged disease-free survival in lymphomas of the unfavorable diffuse histiocytic and diffuse undifferentiated histopathologic subgroups, was administered to 44 patients with advanced favorable and intermediate-prognosis non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including nodular lymphoma of the poorly differentiated lymphocytic, mixed, and histiocytic subtypes, and diffuse lymphoma of the poorly differentiated lymphocytic or mixed histologic subtypes. High-dose methotrexate (3 g/m2) was given on Day 14 between cycles of bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone, administered every 3 weeks for ten cycles. Leucovorin factor (10 mg/m2) was given iv 24 hours after the methotrexate infusion was completed, and was continued at 10 mg/m2 by mouth every 6 hours for 72 hours. Therapy was well-tolerated, with predictable myelosuppression in the majority of patients. The complete response rate was 57% (25 of 44 patients), including ten of 18 (56%) patients with nodular and 15 of 26 (58%) patients with diffuse lymphomas. Median overall follow-up among living patients is 65 months, 58 months for patients with nodular and 69 months for patients with diffuse histologic subgroups. Overall survival at 5 years was 64% for patients who achieved complete response, 32% for partial responders, and 0% for those patients who did not respond. Disease-free survival of complete responders was 43% at 5 years, with only one disease-related death noted after 36 months. The nodular and diffuse patient subgroups had similar overall and disease-free survivals. Although initial bone marrow involvement was documented in nine of 18 (50%) nodular patients and in 13 of 26 (50%) diffuse patients, CNS relapse occurred in only one complete and two partial responders. The prolonged disease-free survival observed after M-BACOD therapy demonstrates that durable responses can be achieved with intensive chemotherapy.
Auditory neuropathy is a hearing disorder characterized by normal function of outer hair cells, evidenced by intact cochlear microphonic (CM) potentials and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), with absent or severely dys-synchronized auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). To determine if selective lesions of inner hair cells (IHCs) and auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) can account for these primary clinical features of auditory neuropathy, we measured physiological responses from chinchillas with large lesions of ANFs (about 85%) and IHCs (45% loss in the apical half of the cochlea; 73% in the basal half). Distortion product OAEs and CM potentials were significantly enhanced, whereas summating potentials and compound action potentials (CAPs) were significantly reduced. CAP threshold was elevated by 7.5dB, but response synchrony was well preserved down to threshold levels of stimulation. Similarly, ABR threshold was elevated by 5.6dB, but all waves were present and well synchronized down to threshold levels in all animals. Thus, large lesions of IHCs and ANFs reduced response amplitudes but did not abolish or severely dys-synchronize CAPs or ABRs. Pathologies other than or in addition to ANF and IHC loss are likely to account for the evoked potential dys-synchrony that is a clinical hallmark of auditory neuropathy in humans.
Rats were trained to use the right forelimb to exert continuous downward pressure on a force transducer and simultaneously to drink sweetened milk from a dipper controlled by the emitted force. Oscillations in forelimb force during this performance were spectrally analyzed to describe the tremorogenic effects of haloperidol (0.04, 0.08, or 0.16 mg/kg). Haloperidol reduced time-on-task and increased the variance of force oscillations in the 10.0-25.0-Hz frequency band. When atropine sulfate (5 mg/kg) was given along with haloperidol, time-on-task was partially restored, and the effects of haloperidol on the 10.0-25.0-Hz band were diminished. These data suggest that the behavioral deficits produced by relatively low doses of haloperidol in rats are analogous (and possibly homologous) to neuroleptic-induced Parkinsonian symptoms in humans.
To describe a case of symptomatic hepatotoxicity attributed to oxaprozin use.
A 41-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital with malaise, anorexia, and right upper quadrant pain. The patient was found to have severe jaundice with liver enzyme elevation. Laboratory test results for potential etiologies were negative, except for the use of oxaprozin for the preceding six weeks. Diagnosis of drug-induced hepatotoxicity was made by liver biopsy. The patient's symptoms resolved and liver enzymes normalized after oxaprozin was discontinued.
Symptomatic hepatic effects attributable to most nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are rare and usually mild. Oxaprozin has been shown to cause mild elevation of liver enzymes in clinical studies. This is the second reported case of presumed oxaprozin-induced icteric hepatitis. The mechanism of oxaprozin-induced hepatotoxicity is unclear, but is thought to be due to metabolic idiosyncrasy. Most NSAID reactions are hepatocellular and occur because of individual susceptibility (idiosyncrasy). In general, people aged >40 years and women are more predisposed to NSAID-induced liver injury.
Although this toxicity is rare, clinicians should be aware of the potential for oxaprozin to cause hepatotoxicity and use caution when prescribing this medication. This case also stresses the importance of careful inquiry regarding drug or toxin exposure in cases of unexplained hepatitis.
To report a case of angioedema associated with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan.
A 62-year-old African-American woman was admitted to the hospital for acute renal failure and uncontrolled hypertension. After attempting blood pressure control with three different agents, captopril was combined with metoprolol. The patient noted swelling of the lips combined with shortness of breath after four days of captopril. Losartan was substituted for captopril, which then produced similar swelling of the lips (without shortness of breath) after only one dose. These symptoms resolved after discontinuation of losartan and administration of antihistamines.
Losartan, like other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, blocks the action of angiotensin II at the receptor level. Five published case reports involved patients with a prior history of intolerance to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Two published case reports of similar reactions also occurred in patients with renal compromise. The mechanism for this reaction from losartan is not known, but may not be due to bradykinin excess.
Clinicians should be aware that angiotensin receptor antagonists may not be safe alternatives in patients who have a history of angioedema secondary to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
To explore the possibility that stable MMP patients have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and abnormal sleep architecture defined by nocturnal sleep stages and sleep efficiency.
Observational.
Regional Methadone Service and sleep disorders laboratory in a university affiliated hospital. Participants and measurements. Ten stable MMP patients and nine normal subjects were assessed clinically and with overnight polysomnography.
There were no differences in age, sex and body mass index between the groups. The methadone dose ranged between 50 and 120 mg/day. Six patients had central apnoea index (CAI) greater than 5, four had a CAI greater than 10 and three of these exhibited periodic breathing. No normal subject had central sleep apnoea. The patients had lower sleep efficiency (p < 0.05), less slow wave sleep (p < 0.01), less rapid eye movement sleep (p < 0.05) and more Stage 2 sleep (p < 0.05) than controls.
Stable MMP patients have more sleep architecture abnormalities than controls and a higher prevalence of central sleep apnoea. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, to delineate the mechanisms for the abnormalities and to assess whether the SDB is related to sudden death in stable MMP patients. We recommend that MMP patients have awake and sleep respiration assessed to identify those potentially at risk.
To report a case of angioedema associated with losartan administration.
A 45-year-old white man with a history of hypertension and gout was treated with losartan/hydrochlorothiazide, allopurinol, and colchicine. The patient experienced two episodes of angioedema within a 10-hour period. On both occasions the symptoms resolved after treatment.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are associated with a relatively high incidence of angioedema. The incidence of angioedema secondary to losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is unknown. The patient reported in this case differs significantly from the two cases reported in the literature because he had normal renal function, no previous exposure to ACE inhibitors, the reaction was of late onset, and the symptoms recurred.
This case suggests that losartan can induce late-onset angioedema in patients with normal renal function and that the reaction can recur after initial resolution of the symptoms.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of S-adenosylmethionine on liver peroxidation and liver fibrogenesis in carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis was induced in three groups of six rats by repeated injections of carbon tetrachloride over 9 weeks. One group of animals was treated only with carbon tetrachloride, and the other two received carbon tetrachloride plus S-adenosylmethionine (10 mg/kg intramuscularly daily) from week 3 to week 9, and from week 6 to week 9 of the study, respectively. Two additional groups of six rats, a control group and a group treated only with S-adenosylmethionine, were also studied. Glutathione concentration, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, collagen content, prolyl hydroxylase activity, and procollagen type I mRNA expression were determined in liver samples.
All carbon tetrachloride-treated rats had cirrhosis at the end of the study. Cirrhosis was also present in five of the six carbon tetrachloride-treated rats receiving S-adenosylmethionine for 3 weeks, but in only one of the six rats that received S-adenosylmethionine for 6 weeks. Hepatic glutathione was significantly diminished in carbon tetrachloride-treated rats (2.7 +/- 0.3 mumol/g tissue) and returned to normal in rats receiving S-adenosylmethionine for 3 or 6 weeks (3.7 +/- 0.13 and 3.9 +/- 0.11 mumol/g tissue, respectively). The hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were significantly lower in rats treated with carbon tetrachloride and S-adenosylmethionine for 6 weeks (98 +/- 5 nmol/g) than in rats treated with carbon tetrachloride (134 +/- 12 nmol/g) and in those treated with carbon tetrachloride and S-adenosylmethionine for 3 weeks (127 +/- 13 nmol/g). There were no differences in either hepatic collagen and prolyl hydroxylase activity between rats that received only carbon tetrachloride and those treated with S-adenosylmethionine for 3 weeks. In contrast, carbon tetrachloride-treated rats receiving S-adenosylmethionine for 6 weeks had significantly lower collagen and prolyl hydroxylase activity than the other two groups. A much greater increase in procollagen type I mRNA was found in carbon tetrachloride-treated rats than in rats treated with carbon tetrachloride and S-adenosylmethionine for 6 weeks. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and prolyl hydroxylase activity and hepatic collagen.
We conclude that the early administration of S-adenosylmethionine in a model of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury restores glutathione levels and reduces lipid peroxidation, resulting in less advanced liver fibrosis.
A point-prevalence study in South-west Scotland found that 0.77 per 1,000 of the total population were receiving lithium. Almost one quarter had done so for more than ten years. At the time of lithium commencement, only 68% had always been diagnosed as having an affective illness; 59% of the patients were also receiving antidepressants, major tranquillisers, or both. Though this might be due in part to unnecessary administration of supplementary drugs, 19% of non-inpatients had moderate depressive symptoms, significant depressive illness, or manic symptoms. Lithium side-effects were prominent: 30% of the sample complained of weight gain, thirst or excessive micturition; 42% had noticed hair changes; and 7% had diminished thyroid activity, but most patients believed they had benefited considerably from lithium therapy.
To evaluate, in right ventricular (RV) myocardial infarction, the role of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and left ventricular (LV) damage and the response to treatment of low cardiac output, 20 patients were prospectively studied. Volume infusion increased cardiac output only slightly (11%, p less than 0.001), despite a dramatic increase in ventricular filling pressures. Dobutamine (4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) markedly increased cardiac output (24%, p less than 0.001) with a decrease in ventricular filling pressures. In the 5 patients with TR, dobutamine only modestly increased cardiac output (9 vs 26%, p less than 0.001), while stroke index and LV end-diastolic dimensions decreased in comparison (-5 vs 33% and -6 vs 9%, respectively, p less than 0.001). In the absence of TR (n = 15), there was no significant difference in response to volume expansion between patients with normal (n = 7) and depressed LV ejection fraction (n = 8). In contrast, dobutamine, in patients with depressed LV function, induced a greater increase in cardiac output (38 vs 17%, p less than 0.01) and RV ejection fraction (36 vs 12%, p less than 0.05). All patients with RV infarction-induced low cardiac output responded only modestly to volume loading. Dobutamine is particularly efficacious in patients without TR who have depressed LV function by improving RV function and, consequently, LV preload. In the 5 patients with TR, increasing RV contractility failed to improve the forward stroke volume by increasing the regurgitant fraction.
The rheumatism induced by anticonvulsants has been described in literature mostly because of phenobarbital therapy. The possible onset of this clinical picture due to other antiepileptic drugs is unusual and not well defined. We report the case of a 87-year-old female, affected by partial seizures treated with carbamazepine for 20 years, who came to our observation for the onset of disturbances that clearly resemble the classic syndrome of rheumatism induced by barbiturates: the diagnostic hypothesis of a drug side effect was confirmed by the marked clinical improvement of the patient after carbamazepine was stopped and substituted by gabapentin.
