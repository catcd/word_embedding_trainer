The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect caused by the inhibition of histamine catabolism by means of metoprine and the activation of histamine H(1) receptors by selective agonists on learning and memory processes, using a modified method of the mouse passive avoidance test. The administration of scopolamine 1 mg/kg (i. p.) immediately after the training session caused statistically-significant amnesia during the retention trial performed 24 h later. Piracetam (30 mg/kg (i.p.)), used as a positive control, and administered 20 min before the training session, prevented scopolamine-induced memory impairment. The histamine-N-methyltransferase inhibitor, metoprine, (2 and 5 mg/kg (s.c.)) had effects similar to those of this nootropic drug. The highly-selective H(1) receptor agonist, 2-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)histamine (FMPH) (2.65 and 6.5 microg/mouse (i.c.v.)) and the less selective agonist, 2-thiazolylethylamine (2-TEA) (0.1 and 0.3 microg/mouse (i.c.v.)) both antagonized the scopolamine-induced amnesia significantly and in a dose-related manner. The selective H(1) receptor antagonist, pyrilamine (20 mg/kg (i.p.)), revealed no effect by itself, but significantly prevented the antiamnesic action both that of the H(1) receptor agonists, and that of endogenous histamine, released by metoprine, thus suggesting a cognitive improvement via the activation of H(1) receptors.
Ketamine in dose 10 mg/kg increased the number of erroneous choices of rats with spatial strategy and didn't effect searching accuracy of rats with non-spatial strategy in 8-arm radial maze. Ketamine in doses 1 and 5 mg/kg disrupted rat short-term memory in delayed response reaction. Physostigmine and aspartic acid, but not haloperidol, diminished ketamine amnesia, therefore ketamine impaired the interaction of cholinergic and glutamate/aspartatergic neurons of hippocampal areas.
Intraventricular injection of prostacyclin (PGI2) slightly depressed the general behavior and produced a weak hypothermia in rats. It shortened the response to a thermal nociceptive stimulus and intensified catalepsy caused by chloropromazine and haloperidol. PGI2 did not change concentration of noradrenaline, 4-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and dopamine in different brain areas. It markedly lowered blood pressure and increased respiration. The duration of central hypotensive effect of PGI2 was shortened after 6-hydroxydopamine on 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine pretreatment. The possible involvement of a central mechanism in the hypotensive action of PGI2 requires further clarification.
Recent evidence suggests that increased cortisol secretion, altered cortisol metabolism, and/or increased tissue sensitivity to cortisol may link insulin resistance, hypertension, and obesity. Whether these changes are important in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is unknown. We performed an integrated assessment of glucocorticoid secretion, metabolism, and action in 25 unmedicated lean male patients with hyperglycemia (20 with type 2 diabetes and 5 with impaired glucose intolerance by World Health Organization criteria) and 25 healthy men, carefully matched for body mass index, age, and blood pressure. Data are mean +/- SE. Patients with hyperglycemia (DM) had higher HbA(1c) (6.9 +/- 0.2% vs. 6.0 +/- 0.1%, P < 0.0001) and triglycerides. Cortisol secretion was not different, as judged by 0900 h plasma cortisol and 24 h total urinary cortisol metabolites. However, the proportion of cortisol excreted as 5alpha- and 5beta-reduced metabolites was increased in DM patients. Following an oral dose of cortisone 25 mg, generation of plasma cortisol by hepatic 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD 1) was impaired in DM patients (area under the curve, 3617 +/- 281 nM.2 h vs. 4475 +/- 228; P < 0.005). In contrast, in sc gluteal fat biopsies from 17 subjects (5 DM and 12 controls) in vitro 11beta-HSD 1 activity was not different (area under the curve, 128 +/- 56% conversion.30 h DM vs. 119 +/- 21, P = 0.86). Sensitivity to glucocorticoids was increased in DM patients both centrally (0900 h plasma cortisol after overnight 250 micro g oral dexamethasone 172 +/- 16 nM vs. 238 +/- 20 nM, P < 0.01) and peripherally (more intense forearm dermal blanching following overnight topical beclomethasone; 0.56 +/- 0.92 ratio to vehicle vs. 0.82 +/- 0.69, P < 0.05). In summary, in patients with glucose intolerance, cortisol secretion, although normal, is inappropriately high given enhanced central and peripheral sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Normal 11beta-HSD 1 activity in adipose tissue with impaired hepatic conversion of cortisone to cortisol suggests that tissue-specific changes in 11beta-HSD 1 activity in hyperglycemia differ from those in primary obesity but may still be susceptible to pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme to reduce intracellular cortisol concentrations. Thus, altered cortisol action occurs not only in obesity and hypertension but also in glucose intolerance, and could therefore contribute to the link between these multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
Terbutaline, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, has been shown to cause hypokalemia and an increase of plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations. We considered that terbutaline-induced hypokalemia may be due to the insulin-induced shift of potassium (K+) from the extracellular to the intracellular space. If so, then inhibition of insulin secretion by somatostatin would prevent terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. Further, we wondered whether oral potassium pretreatment could prevent terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. Therefore, 10 healthy volunteers (5 men, 5 women; mean age, 23 yr +/- 3 SD) received either sodium chloride (NaCl) or somatostatin intravenously together with 0.25 mg terbutaline subcutaneously in a double-blind crossover design. On a third test day, they received 39 mval of K+ powder orally before terbutaline injection in an open trial. Terbutaline caused a significant decrease of K+ (from 3.96 +/- 0.08 to 3.3 +/- 0.13 mmol/L +/- SEM; p less than 0.0005), accompanied by a significant increase in plasma glucose (from 83 +/- 3.6 to 101 +/- 4.4 mg/dl +/- SEM; p less than 0.01) and serum insulin concentrations (from 11.7 +/- 0.9 to 19.9 +/- 1.1 microU/ml +/- SEM; p less than 0.001), confirming earlier data. Somatostatin pretreatment inhibited the terbutaline-induced hypokalemia; the small fall of K+ (from 3.7 +/- 0.08 to 3.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/L) was no longer significant. Insulin secretion was completely blocked by somatostatin, leading to an even more pronounced increase of blood glucose. Hypokalemia after terbutaline injection was not prevented by oral potassium pretreatment. In summary, the present findings confirm that terbutaline-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased plasma glucose and insulin levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
A patient with symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome after levodopa withdrawal is described. The patient presented with persistent high fever, stupor, autonomic dysfunction, rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis. He was successfully treated with intravenous dantrolene, resumption of levodopa, and forced alkaline diuresis. Doctors should be aware of the risk of abrupt cessation of dopamine agonists.
Recent repopularization of intrahepatic infusion chemotherapy has been made possible by the development of the implantable Infusaid pump. Surgical placement of a catheter into the gastroduodenal artery with division of collaterals to the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas has reduced the incidence of gastroduodenal ulceration and pancreatitis. The risk of chemical cholecystitis similarly demands prevention. Anatomically, the cystic artery is a branch of the right hepatic artery in over 95 percent of patients. As a result, even a normal gallbladder is subjected to high-dose chemotherapy with the risk of development of drug-induced cholecystitis. In our first six patients undergoing pump implantation who had normal appearing gallbladders at the time of surgery, two developed symptomatic cholecystitis, necessitating cholecystectomy after receiving intrahepatic chemotherapy. As a result, we recommend elective cholecystectomy at the time of arterial catheterization for intrahepatic chemotherapy.
Hypertensive diabetic rats develop a cardiomyopathy characterized by systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, pulmonary congestion and a very high mortality rate. Alterations in contractile proteins and sarcoplasmic reticular calcium (Ca2+) transport in diabetic myocardium and their partial reversal with verapamil suggest that calcium channel blockade may prevent death from congestive heart failure in hypertensive diabetic rats. A large group of rats with renovascular hypertension and streptozotocin diabetes were divided into four groups: untreated animals (Group 1) and animals treated with 100 (Group 2), 300 (Group 3) or 600 (Group 4) mg/kg per day of sustained release diltiazem mixed in their food. Treatment was begun shortly after the onset of hypertension and diabetes. Mortality rates after 4 months were 59% (19 of 32), 53% (17 of 32), 27% (7 of 26) and 35% (12 of 34) in Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively; the mortality rate in age-matched control rats was 5% (1 of 19). The reductions in mortality rates in Groups 3 and 4 were statistically significant. Diltiazem did not change systolic blood pressure, serum glucose concentration, heart rate or left ventricular mass. There was a trend to decreased left ventricular interstitial fibrosis and perivascular fibrosis in diltiazem-treated animals. Ventricular collagen concentration was similar in untreated hypertensive diabetic and control rats; levels were higher in hypertensive diabetic rats that died than in those that survived. There was a trend to decreased collagen concentration as diltiazem dose increased. Myosin isoenzyme distribution was not changed in Groups 3 and 4 (in comparison with Group 1). In all hypertensive diabetic groups, rats that died had a higher blood pressure, heart rate, relative left ventricular mass, lung weight and lung water than did survivors. The mortality rate was two to three times higher among rats with an initial blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg. The beneficial effects of diltiazem on survival were most significant among rats with severe hypertension.
Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP, DYT12) is a distinctive autosomal-dominant movement disorder with variable expressivity and reduced penetrance characterized by abrupt onset of dystonia, usually accompanied by signs of parkinsonism. The sudden onset of symptoms over hours to a few weeks, often associated with physical or emotional stress, suggests a trigger initiating a nervous system insult resulting in permanent neurologic disability. We report the finding of six missense mutations in the gene for the Na+/K+ -ATPase alpha3 subunit (ATP1A3) in seven unrelated families with RDP. Functional studies and structural analysis of the protein suggest that these mutations impair enzyme activity or stability. This finding implicates the Na+/K+ pump, a crucial protein responsible for the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane, in dystonia and parkinsonism.
We investigated the effects of paraoxonase (PON1) 192 polymorphism on serum PON1 activity and the impact of phenotypic expression on the risk and prognosis of Turkish children with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Eighteen children with biopsy-proven Type I MPGN (10 boys, 8 girls) and age-matched 53 healthy controls were included in the study. PCR (polymerase chain reaction), RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques were used to determine the PON1 192 genotype. PON1 activity was measured by spectrophotometric assay of p-nitrophenol production following addition of paraoxon. We found that PON1 192 genotype distribution (AA, AB, BB) in MPGN patients were 61.1%, 22.3%, 16.6% and 15.1%, 35.8%, 49.1% in controls, respectively. The frequency of AA genotypes was significantly higher in the MPGN group (0.611) compared with the healthy controls (0.151) (p < 0.001). Although the serum PON1 activity was lower in MPGN patients (103.3 +/- 55.2 U/l) than the healthy controls (130.9 +/- 71.2 U/mol), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0563). In the genotypes of patients and controls classified according to PON1 A/B polymorphism; serum PON1 activities were significantly increased (p < 0.001, ANOVA) in the order of PON1 AA, AB and BB in both MPGN patients (82.4, 91.7 and 173.6 U/l) and healthy controls (85.9, 119.9 and 193.1 U/l), respectively. There was a significant relationship between the poor prognosis and having AA genotype and low PON1 activity. Of the 8 patients with poor prognosis, 7 had genotype AA and the remaining one was AB heterozygote. Our results suggest that homozygosity for the A allele might have an important role on the risk for developing MPGN and may also be associated with the poor prognosis of disease. In conclusion, we suggest that the PON1 activities are affected by PON1 genetic variability in Turkish patients with MPGN.
Beta-adrenergics are used frequently in the management of asthma. Tremor has been found to be a limiting side effect with the oral or the inhaled forms. We describe one child who developed gross tremors necessitating an extensive neurologic evaluation to eliminate any other cause. With the results of a normal work-up and the reappearance of tremor when challenged again, the diagnosis of increased sensitivity to the tremorogenic effect of beta-adrenergics was made.
The effects of inducers of liver microsomal enzymes on the induction of hyperplastic liver nodules by N-2-fluorenylacetamide (2-FAA) were studied in male F344 rats. The rats were fed a diet containing 200 ppm 2-FAA for 2 weeks and then given test chemicals for the following 8 weeks. Partial hepatectomies were performed at the end of the third week of the experiment. The compounds were tested, and their concentrations (in ppm) in the diet were as follows: 1,000 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), 500 PCB, 500 PCB plus 70 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA); 500 PCB plus 500 phenobarbital, 70 MCA, 500 phenobarbital, 500 phenobarbital plus 500 beta-naphthoflavone, and 2,500 3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyloxazoline-dione-2,4 (DDOD). All experimental groups developed significantly greater numbers and total areas of hyperplastic nodules than did the controls. In groups treated similarly with the test chemicals but without partial hepatectomy, the numbers and total areas of hyperplastic nodules were significantly less than those in the experimental groups with partial hepatectomy. Administration of test chemicals except 2-FAA to partially hepatectomized rats did not induce hyperplastic nodules. The present results showed the early detection of the enhancing effect on induction of hyperplastic liver nodules by a system consisting of the following three procedures: 1) 2-FAA feeding; 2) administration of test chemicals, and 3) partial hepatectomy during administration of test chemicals. In this system DDOD enhanced the induction of hyperplastic nodules of the liver.
Nasturtium officinale R. Br. (Brassicaceae) has been used as a home remedy by the people of south eastern (SE) region of Iran as a medicinal plant. This therapeutical application has been attributed to Nasturtium officinale (N. officinale) antioxidant capacity which is mostly tested by means of cell-free assays: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). In addition, the antioxidant effect of N. officinale extract has been investigated in hypercholesterolaemic rats in vivo. The results revealed that the extract has notable scavenging activity against DPPH radicals as well as potent reducing power in FRAP assay. Intragastric administration of N. officinale (500 mg/kg body weight per day) to groups of hypercholesterolaemic rats for 30 days lowered their blood total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 37, 44 and 48%, respectively. However, the blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the same treated rats increased by 16%. To evaluate the mechanism(s) of action, we studied the antioxidative potential of N. officinale extract in terms of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and also the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the liver tissues. In addition, hepatic tissue malondialdehyde level (MDA, an index of lipid peroxidation) was also determined. Under hypercholesterolaemic condition, hepatic MDA was increased. Moreover, our data indicated GSH depletion along with significant reduction in the activities of CAT and SOD in rats fed high-fat diet rats. On the other hand, significant elevation in the activities of GPx and GR were seen in the same group of rats. Treatment of hypercholesterolaemic rats with N. officinale extract significantly increased the GSH level along with enhanced CAT and SOD activities in liver tissues. Furthermore, N. officinale extract significantly decreased hepatic MDA as well as GPx and GR activities in plant-treated rats. Based on our data, it can be concluded that N. officinale has a high hypolipidaemic activity and this may be attributed to its antioxidative potential.
Medulloblastomas (MBs) constitute an aggressive class of intracranial pediatric tumors. Current multimodality treatments for MBs include surgery, ionizing radiation, and chemotherapy. Toxic side effects of therapies coupled with high incidence of recurrence and the metastatic spread warrant development of more effective, less toxic therapies for this disease. CARP-1/CCAR1 is a peri-nuclear phospho-protein that is a co-activator of the cell cycle regulatory anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ligase. CARP-1 functional mimetics (CFMs) are a novel class of small molecule compounds that interfere with CARP-1 binding with APC/C subunit APC-2, and suppress growth of a variety of cancer cells in part by promoting apoptosis. Here we investigated MB growth inhibitory potential of the CFMs and found that CFM-4 inhibits growth of MB cells in part by inducing CARP-1 expression, promoting PARP cleavage, activating pro-apoptotic stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) p38 and JNK, and apoptosis. Gene-array-based analysis of the CFM-4-treated Daoy MB cells indicated down-regulation of a number of key cell growth and metastasis-promoting genes including cell motility regulating small GTP binding protein p21Rac1, and extracellular matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-10. Moreover, CFM-4 treatment stimulated expression of a number of molecules such as neurotrophin (NTF)3, and NF-κB signaling inhibitors ABIN1 and 2 proteins. Overexpression of NTF3 resulted in reduced MB cell viability while knock-down of NTF3 interfered with CFM-4-dependent loss of viability. CFMs also attenuated biological properties of the MB cells by blocking their abilities to migrate, form colonies in suspension, and invade through the matrix-coated membranes. Together our data support anti-MB properties of CFM-4, and provide a proof-of-concept basis for further development of CFMs as potential anti-cancer agents for MBs.
We investigated the role of angiotensin II and endothelin-1 using the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan and the endothelin ETA receptor antagonist atrasentan, in malignant hypertension and renal failure and damage induced by nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibition in Harlan Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. We also evaluated whether the protective effects of losartan go beyond the blood pressure reduction. Within only 3 weeks of treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), Harlan SD rats developed malignant hypertension with renal failure and injuries. The latter were comprised of fibrinoid necrosis of small arteries and glomerular and tubular necrosis. Although both losartan and atrasentan attenuated the development of hypertension and renal failure, losartan only prevented the renal damage. In contrast to antrasentan, the vasodilator hydralazine reduced blood pressure and prevented the renal injuries similar to losartan. However, when these treatments were prolonged to 5 weeks, losartan, but not hydralazine, was still effective in reducing renal failure and damage, despite a marked increase in blood pressure. Our results indicate that angiotensin II and endothelin-1 play a differential role in the pathogenesis of malignant hypertension and in vascular and renal damage induced by L-NAME in Harlan SD rats. Although the protective effects of atrasentan may depend on the reduction of blood pressure, which was shown to retard the development of renal injury using hydralazine, those of losartan go beyond the blood pressure reduction. Hence, tissue protective effects of angiotensin AT1 receptor blockade may be pivotal for long-term vascular and renal protection.
The incidence of posttransfusion hepatitis and "fulminant" hepatitis was investigated by a plan devised at our hospital in December 1982. Of 2959 blood recipients between January 1982 and December 1988, 504 (22.5%) developed posttransfusion hepatitis, with a mean transfusion volume of 10.2 units. Of the 504 cases of posttransfusion hepatitis, "icteric" (T-Bil > 2.0 mg/dl) and "overt icteric" hepatitis (T-Bil > 5.0 mg-dl) developed in 111 cases (22.0%) and 28 cases (5.6%), respectively. Of the 28 overt icteric hepatitis cases, 13 (2.8%) were thought to be true overt icteric posttransfusion hepatitis because the icterus was caused by other reasons in the other 15 cases (seven neonatal jaundice, four hemolytic anemia, one radiation hepatitis, one halothane-induced hepatitis; two other cases were excluded because chronic liver disease was diagnosed by imaging procedures despite serum ALTs in the normal range before transfusion). The anti-HCV serostatus was investigated in five of the 13 true overt icteric posttransfusion hepatitis patients using blood specimens taken 180 days or more following the onset of posttransfusion hepatitis. Anti-HCV seroconversion occurred in three of the five cases (60%). HCV seroconversions were not seen in the cases in which the icterus was due to other reasons.
Hydromorphone is often administered intrathecally for the treatment of cancer and nonmalignant chronic intractable pain. It is frequently utilized in combination with other analgesics in a multidrug intrathecal infusion; however, very little data are available documenting efficacy or safety of intrathecal hydromorphone as a solo analgesic.
This study was conducted to examine pain and side effects in patients receiving intrathecal hydromorphone.
A retrospective review was conducted of all patients receiving intrathecal hydromorphone monotherapy in two large pain specialty practices in the Pacific Northwest. All data collected within 30 days of the patient's 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month anniversary of implant were analyzed.
Twenty-four patients with noncancer-related chronic pain were included in the study. Thirteen patients had eligible pain data at 1 month, 10 patients had pain data at 3 months and seven patients had pain data available at 12 months after initiation of intrathecal hydromorphone.
Average pain scores decreased significantly (P = 0.03). Side-effect and pain-interference scores remained essentially unchanged in this small sample of patients.
Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography is a useful and relatively safe test for coronary artery disease assessment. However, possible complications should be recognized. We describe a case of transient global amnesia in a woman who underwent a standard-protocol dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiogram for coronary ischaemia detection, after having complained about chest pain. The test was not positive for coronary ischaemia, but a typical picture of transient global amnesia ensued. Symptoms shortly resolved spontaneously. Neurological work up was negative for organic disease. Transient global amnesia is a neurological syndrome of unknown origin and good prognosis. Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography can be added to the described precipitants of transient global amnesia. This neurological syndrome should be taken into account as a possible complication of dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography.
This study evaluates whether the iron deficiency suggested in children and adolescents with overweight is also present with increasing age.
We examined 50 consecutive postmenopausal nondiabetic white women with a BMI > or =30 kg/m(2) and 50 non-obese seemingly healthy women as a control group. In addition to the traditional indices of iron status, we measured the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels, a sensitive and highly quantitative indicator of early iron deficiency not influenced by the acute phase response.
Obese women have higher serum sTfR levels than control subjects [1.38 (range, 0.89 to 2.39) vs. 1.16 mg/dL (range, 0.69 to 2.03 mg/dL); p < 0.001]. However, no difference in ferritin concentration was observed between the groups [70.50 (range, 18 to 219) vs. 69.50 ng/mL (range, 24 to 270 ng/mL); p = not significant]. A positive correlation between BMI and sTfR concentration was detected. On multiple regression analyses, BMI (positively) and ferritin (inversely) were independent predictors accounting for sTfR.
These results suggest that a moderate degree of iron deficiency is also present among adult women with obesity. The determination of sTfR is useful in the evaluation of iron status in this condition. Further studies with a greater number of patients are required to investigate the relationship between tissue iron concentrations and obesity.
The standard treatment of HCV infection with pegylated interferon-alpha2a or -alpha2b and ribavirin is effective in <50% of HCV genotype-1-infected patients. To improve this figure, it might be desirable to obtain optimal plasma concentrations of the drug by increasing the dose. Unfortunately, there is great interpatient variability in ribavirin pharmacokinetics. In the present review, we describe the mechanism of ribavirin-induced anaemia in detail, evaluate host predictive factors for this harmful side effect and assess the literature data on attempts to improve the sustained virological response rate by increasing the dose of ribavirin. We suggest an optimal steady-state concentration range for ribavirin in monoinfected and coinfected patients. Lastly, we propose that it would be of particular value to monitor ribavirin concentrations in HCV genotype-1-infected patients and (regardless of the genotype) coinfected patients, haemodialyzed patients and obese patients.
Pentavalent antimony-mannan (Sb[V]-mannan) was 10-fold more potent than sodium stibogluconate in a murine model of visceral leishmaniasis. Liver antimony concentrations were six-fold higher after Sb[V]-mannan therapy compared with a dose of sodium stibogluconate that was equipotent in reducing liver parasite burdens. Murine toxicity of Sb[V]-mannan was variable, with a 50% lethal dose (LD50) for one preparation that was well above the concentration that killed 90% of the parasites, and for another preparation was only modestly higher than the concentration that killed 90% of the parasites.
To illustrate some differences between humans and rodents in the dose-effect relationships for two ototoxic drugs.
Controlled animal study using typical research regimens for gentamicin and cisplatin compared with human data from the clinical literature.
Auditory brainstem response testing was carried out over months in two groups of animals exposed to typical dose regimens for ototoxic drugs. In the first group, 30 guinea pigs received either 3 or 6 mg/kg of cisplatin on alternate days for 5 days (total dose 15 or 30 mg/kg). In the second group, 24 C57 mice received saline or 19 daily doses of gentamicin 120 mg/kg. The findings in rodents were contrasted with human toxicity in the literature.
Cisplatin increased click thresholds (32 +/- 27 dB) in guinea pigs. Doses of 15 mg/kg caused less hearing loss than 30 mg/kg, but the higher dose was associated with greater mortality owing to renal insufficiency. These findings are comparable with expectations of similar doses of cisplatin in humans. In contrast, gentamicin produced less hearing loss in mice, although the dose employed was well above the lethal dose for humans.
Ototoxic doses of cisplatin in guinea pigs are similar to those of humans, but C57 mice appear to be highly resistant to gentamicin-induced hearing loss compared to humans. Animal models of ototoxicity need to be considered carefully in translational research.
We studied the effects of medial pallidotomy in the first 20 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing this MRI/electrophysiologically guided procedure at our institution. The mean age of patients was 65.5 years (median 66.5) and none suffered any serious complications. Pallidotomy significantly improved motor function in both "on" and "off" states as measured by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and timed tests (Purdue pegboard and counter tapping) in the arm contralateral to surgery 3 months postoperatively. Patients also improved in terms of activities of daily living, reflected by improved UPDRS activity of daily living and complications of therapy scoring and reduced levodopa-induced dyskinesias; six of 11 patients who could not walk in an "off" state prior to surgery could do so postoperatively. The total UPDRS score improved by 22% from preoperative values. The aforementioned improvements occurred similarly in patients greater than (n = 11) or less than 65 years (n = 9) at surgery. Neuropsychological measures indicated that although the majority of cognitive function remains unchanged in right-handed PD patients following dominant (left) hemisphere pallidotomy, mild specific declines in word generation are present. The findings of this study suggest that unilateral pallidotomy is safe and associated with improved motor functioning in elderly as well as younger PD patients experiencing significant disability despite optimal medical therapy.
The anticonvulsant effect of ethanol against N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-(NMDA), kainic acid-, and picrotoxin-induced convulsions was studied in rats. Ethanol (2 g/kg, ip) offered protection against these agents, and it was most effective against picrotoxin and least effective against kainic acid. MK801, NMDA receptor antagonist, also provided protection against these agents. However, it was most effective against NMDA and least effective against kainic acid. Ineffective doses of MK801 (0.1 mg/kg, ip) and ethanol (0.5 g/kg, ip), when administered concurrently, had a facilitatory anticonvulsant effect, thereby providing protection against mortality following severe convulsions induced by NMDA or picrotoxin, but not against kainic acid. The protective effect of ethanol against NMDA- and kainic acid-induced neurotoxicity, in contrast to picrotoxin-induced toxicity, was not reversed by imidazodiazepine, Ro 15-4513, an ethanol antagonist. Furthermore, Ro 15-4513 did not produce any proconvulsant effect with NMDA or kainic acid. These findings suggested that the anticonvulsant actions of ethanol may be attributed to its ability to antagonize NMDA-mediated excitatory responses and facilitate the GABAergic transmission.
1. Tacrolimus, a potent immunosuppressant, induces impaired renal function and neurological complications. We investigated the influence of dosing time on the neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and immunosuppressive effect of tacrolimus in rats. 2. The repeated injection of tacrolimus in the light phase (8:00) produced a significantly greater increase than that in the dark phase (20:00) in the duration of harmine-induced tremors and in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration in rats. An immunosuppressive effect of tacrolimus on the xenotransplantation of mouse-to-rat skin grafts was apparent in the dark phase but not in the light phase. 3. The dosing time-dependent pharmacokinetic results were not observed when tacrolimus concentrations in rat whole blood were measured after a single or repeated injection in the light or dark phase. 4. These findings suggest that treatment in the active phase of the diurnal cycle ameliorates neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity while maintaining the immunosuppressive effect of tacrolimus. The present findings have important implications for therapeutic approaches to avoid tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
