To report a case of treatment of bipolar depression and management of antidepressant-induced mania with a low-dose fluoxetine regimen.
A 59-year-old white woman was admitted involuntarily to a New York State psychiatric center with a diagnosis of bipolar (type I) disorder, mixed, with psychotic features. Initial treatment with lithium, olanzapine, and clonazepam produced a remission of manic and psychotic symptoms. However, the patient remained clinically depressed. Addition of oral fluoxetine 10 mg every morning to her medication regimen was followed 22 days later by the development of a manic state. Reduction of the fluoxetine dosage to 10 mg twice weekly was associated with the attainment of euthymia in 18 days. Thirteen days after the fluoxetine dosage reduction, the patient's fluoxetine blood concentration was 20 micrograms/L and the norfluoxetine concentration was reported as 53 micrograms/L.
To our knowledge, this is the first published case that describes the association between a low-dose fluoxetine regimen and the evolution of a bipolar affective state from depression to euthymia via manic switching. The temporal synchrony of this switching with initial implementation of fluoxetine 10 mg every morning, followed by a dose reduction to 10 mg twice weekly, suggests that bipolar depressed patients are extremely sensitive to low doses of antidepressants and to incremental changes in these doses. However, it also suggests that they can respond clinically to such treatment. Furthermore, our laboratory data indicate that antidepressant blood concentrations may play a contributory role in maintaining the balance between euthymia and mania in these patients.
Manic switching is always a concern when treating a bipolar depressed patient. Utilization of a low-dose antidepressant drug regimen may be a clinically prudent approach in such an individual.
Lithium toxicity can produce persistent and possibly permanent neurologic damage involving multiple areas of the nervous system, often including the cerebellum. Such cases, though rare, may continue to occur since lithium salts are widely used. In this report we describe the neurologic presentation, rehabilitation management, and outcome of treatment in such a patient. Her persistent neurologic syndrome was dominated by features of cerebellar dysfunction. Deficits in speech, swallowing, activities of daily living, transfers, and ambulation were identified and a rehabilitation program was implemented. Therapeutic rehabilitative techniques focused on compensatory mechanisms for ataxia and incoordination. Though her basic neurologic status did not change substantially, she did respond well to rehabilitative measures with significant functional gains and the patient was returned to her prior living arrangement.
Renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), arginine vasopressin in plasma (AVP), free water clearance (CH2O) and blood pressure (BP) were determined in 11 patients with essential hypertension at the end of 3 consecutive periods of observation each of 6 of weeks duration; indapamide 2.5 mg daily was given in period 2 and placebo in periods 1 and 3. RPF and GFR were reduced by 9% and BP by 9%/14% supine and 14%/12% standing during indapamide treatment. Changes in renal haemodynamics were not correlated with those in BP. AVP was not significantly altered by indapamide and was not correlated with BP. Indapamide reduced CH2O possibly due to the reduction in GFR. It is concluded that indapamide evidently induces redistribution of the cardiac output, with enhanced muscle blood flow and reduced renal perfusion, and that AVP does not seem to be involved in blood pressure regulation in mild to moderate essential hypertension under basal conditions.
1. Intravesical instillation of xylene (10-100%, dissolved in silicone oil) through a catheter implanted into the bladder of conscious, freely-moving rats produced behavioural effects (licking of lower abdomen or perineal region) suggestive of intense visceral pain, not mimicked by topical application of the irritant on the urethral outlet. 2. The xylene-induced visceral pain was prevented, to the same extent, by systemic desensitization to capsaicin (50 mg/kg s.c.) performed in either adult or newborn rats, as well as by extrinsic bladder denervation (pelvic ganglionectomy), thus indicating the involvement of primary afferents in the bladder wall. 3. Other behavioural responses induced by xylene instillation into the bladder (hind limb hyperextension, grooming) were not affected by systemic capsaicin desensitization in either adult or newborn rats, but were abolished by bladder denervation. 4. Systemic capsaicin desensitization produced an almost complete depletion of substance P-, neurokinin A-like and calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity in the rat urinary bladder. 5. These findings indicate that, in addition to their role in activating reflex micturition, the neuropeptides-containing capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves of the rat bladder are involved in chemogenic visceral pain.
Several prohormone convertases that are involved in the posttranslational processing of precursor proteins, including neuropetides, hormones and neurotrophic factors, are produced in the central nervous system. These include enzymes named furin, PC1, PC2, PC5 and PACE4. To understand better the potential role played by prohormone convertases in the central nervous system we studied the expression of their messenger RNAs in the hippocampus of rats with pilocarpine-induced seizures. Moreover, we compared their expression patterns with those of neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which are up-regulated in the hippocampus during seizures. Pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, i.p.) induced seizure activity that appeared within the first hour and persisted for approximately 8 h. In situ hybridization showed transient increases in messenger RNA for nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor that peaked at 120 min in the hippocampus. Among the convertases studied, only PC1 messenger RNA displayed up-regulation, with temporal and topographic features comparable to those of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA. The expression of furin, PC2 and PC5 messenger RNA changed little, while PACE4 was not expressed at all, both before and after pilocarpine administration. The highest increase in PC1 messenger RNA expression was found in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and, to a lesser extent, in the pyramidal layer of CA1 and CA3 subfields. Thus, in the rat hippocampus, the epileptiform activity induced by pilocarpine mediates a co-ordinated expression of messenger RNAs for PC1, nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Our findings suggest the involvement of PC1 in the processing of precursor proteins during seizure activity.
The issue of sudden deaths due to acute para methoxy amphetamine (PMA) poisoning is presented in the report. The analysis included three cases autopsied at the Forensic Medicine Department in Bia≈Çystok at the beginning of 2009. The toxicological analysis of samples of blood and urine did not confirm the presence of MDMA, also known as ecstasy, but it revealed the presence of para methoxy amphetamine (PMA). During post-mortem examinations, the cause of the death was not established in either case. Based on the above investigations it may be said that the common cause of death was acute para methoxy amphetamine (PMA) poisoning.
To assess safety and efficacy of propofol and thiopental for refractory status epilepticus (RSE) in children, the authors reviewed 34 episodes of RSE. Thiopental was effective in most patients, but there were serious side effects. Propofol was used according to a strict protocol. It was effective in most patients, so that thiopental was not needed. Side effects were infrequent, of minor severity, and fully reversible. The authors suggest the use of propofol before thiopental.
Nephrotic syndrome is associated with abnormal regulation of renal water excretion. To investigate the role of collecting duct water channels and solute transporters in this process, we have carried out semiquantitative immunoblotting of kidney tissues from rats with adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome. These experiments demonstrated that adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome is associated with marked decreases in expression of aquaporin-2, aquaporin-3, aquaporin-4, and the vasopressin-regulated urea transporter in renal inner medulla, indicative of a suppression of the capacity for water and urea absorption by the inner medullary collecting duct. In contrast, expression of the alpha(1)-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase in the inner medulla was unaltered. Light and electron microscopy of perfusion-fixed kidneys demonstrated that the collecting ducts are morphologically normal and unobstructed. Inner medullary expression of the descending limb water channel, aquaporin-1, was not significantly altered, pointing to a selective effect on the collecting duct. Aquaporin-2 and aquaporin-3 expression was also markedly diminished in the renal cortex, indicating that the effect is not limited to the inner medullary collecting duct. Differential centrifugation studies and immunocytochemistry in inner medullary thin sections demonstrated increased targeting of aquaporin-2 to the plasma membrane, consistent with the expected short-term action of vasopressin on aquaporin-2 trafficking. The extensive down-regulation of aquaporin and urea transporter expression may represent an appropriate renal response to the extracellular volume expansion observed in nephrotic syndrome, but may occur at the expense of decreased urinary concentrating and diluting capacity.
To investigate the effect of drugs acting on the endogenous opioid system, we studied 10 adults with Tourette's syndrome who received propoxyphene hydrochloride (260 mg/day), naltrexone hydrochloride (50 mg/day), and placebo in a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial. Using a self-report scale (Tourette's Syndrome Symptom List), subjects noted a significant (p less than 0.04) lessening of tics after treatment with naltrexone when compared with placebo. An improvement in performance on the Trail Making B test, a measure of attention and visuomotor sequencing and planning, occurred after receiving naltrexone when compared with placebo (p less than 0.08) or propoxyphene (p less than 0.02). The Trail Making B test best discriminated the treatments (p less than 0.02, analysis of variance). No other treatment effects were observed for several other measures of tic severity, attentional ability, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Our findings indicate that pharmacological manipulation of the endogenous opioid system does influence symptoms of Tourette's syndrome.
Nephropathic cystinosis is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that codes for a cystine transporter in the lysosomal membrane. Affected patients store 50-100 times the normal amounts of cystine in their cells, and suffer renal tubular and glomerular disease, growth retardation, photophobia, and other systemic complications, including a myopathy and swallowing dysfunction. Using videofluoroscopy and ultrasound examinations, we assessed the swallowing function of 101 patients with nephropathic cystinosis on their most recent admission to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center between 1987 and 2004. These patients ranged in age from 6 to 45 years; more than half had significant complaints of swallowing difficulty. On examination of barium swallow, the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases of swallowing were abnormal in 24%, 51%, and 73% of patients, respectively. The frequency of dysfunction increased with age for each phase of swallowing. Both the Swallowing Severity Score (a measure of dysfunction on barium swallow) and the Oral Muscle Composite Score (a reflection of vocal strength, oral-facial movement, and tongue and lip function) increased (that is, worsened) with the number of years that a patient was not receiving treatment with cysteamine, the cystine-depleting agent of choice in cystinosis. The severity scores decreased with the number of years on cysteamine therapy. The Swallowing Severity Score varied directly with the severity of muscle disease, but was not correlated with the presence or absence of the 57-kb CTNS deletion that commonly occurs in nephropathic cystinosis patients. We conclude that swallowing dysfunction in cystinosis presents a risk of fatal aspiration, correlates with the presence of muscle atrophy, and, based on cross-sectional data, increases in frequency with age and number of years without cysteamine treatment. Cystine-depleting therapy with cysteamine should be considered the treatment of choice for both pre- and posttransplant cystinosis patients.
Ketanserin is a serotonin antagonist with high affinity for S2-serotonergic receptors, which mediate the vasoconstrictor effects of serotonin. It does not block the vasodilator effects of this monoamine, and it is devoid of agonist activity and serious central side effects. Ketanserin, however, also binds to alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The compound (10 mg i.v.) was given to 30 patients with essential hypertension and four normotensive patients with chronic autonomic failure, owing to an efferent sympathetic lesion. Ketanserin lowered systolic and diastolic arterial pressure by about 20%. The effects on cardiac output, cardiac filling pressures, forearm blood flow, renal blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate revealed a hemodynamic pattern compatible with dilatation of both resistance and capacitance vessels. These vasodilator effects were accompanied by moderate reflex stimulation of the heart. The drug did not alter the pressor effect of bolus injections of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine, which contrasted with the competitive antagonism exerted by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. Baroreflex-mediated bradycardia after phenylephrine also was not affected by ketanserin. The drug had a distinct hypotensive effect in patients with autonomic failure, despite the fact that these patients did not respond to the nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, 20 mg i.v. Thus, ketanserin is capable of lowering arterial pressure independently of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. The results are therefore indirect evidence supporting a role of serotonin in hypertension.
In the present study we compared the effects of treatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan and of 'triple therapy' (hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, reserpine) on the course of blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy and angiotensin II concentrations after induction of hypertension in transgenic rats with inducible expression of the mouse renin gene (Cyp1a1-Ren-2 rats).
Hypertension was induced in Cyp1a1-Ren-2 rats through dietary administration of the natural xenobiotic indole-3-carbinol (I3C, 0.3%) for 4 days. Starting on the day before administration of I3C, rats were treated either with candesartan or received triple therapy for 9 days. Systolic blood pressure was measured in conscious animals. Rats were decapitated and angiotensin II levels in plasma and in whole kidney and left ventricular tissues were determined by radioimmunoassay.
Administration of I3C resulted in the development of severe hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy that was accompanied by marked elevations of plasma and tissue angiotensin II concentrations. Candesartan treatment prevented the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy and was associated with a reduction of tissue angiotensin II concentrations. In contrast, triple therapy, despite maintaining systolic blood pressure in the normotensive range, did not prevent the development of cardiac hypertrophy and tissue angiotensin II augmentations.
Our findings indicate that hypertension in Cyp1a1-Ren-2 rats is a clearly angiotensin II-dependent model of hypertension with elevated circulating and tissue angiotensin II concentrations, and that antihypertensive treatment with AT1 receptor blockade is superior to conventional triple therapy in effective protection against hypertension-induced end-organ damage in this rat model.
Reye's syndrome or encephalopathy with fatty infiltration of the liver occurs mainly in childhood and to a lesser degree in adult age. Salicylate may play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Still's disease is a form of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis very rare in the adult. A case is reported of a 39-year old woman who developed Reye's syndrome while on aspirin therapy for the treatment of a classical adult Still's disease.
Two cases of chloroquine-induced neuromyopathy are described. The clinical picture is a proximal weakness of lower limbs in one case, and a sensory peripheral neuropathy in the other. Vacuolar changes were not found in muscle biopsies, but electron microscopic studies revealed characteristic dense and lamellated inclusion bodies in muscle fibers and endothelial cells. Sural nerve biopsies were performed in each case. There was a severe loss of myelinated fibers in one. Dense and lamellated inclusions were found in schwann cells, perineural and endothelial cells. In a literature review, only one case with sural nerve biopsy is found in human pathology of chloroquine neuromyopathy.
Prolonged ouabain administration (25 microg kg(-1) day(-1) for 5 wk) induces "ouabain hypertension" (OH) in rats, but the molecular mechanisms by which ouabain elevates blood pressure are unknown. Here, we compared Ca(2+) signaling in mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) from normotensive (NT) and OH rats. Resting cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt); measured with fura-2) and phenylephrine-induced Ca(2+) transients were augmented in freshly dissociated OH ASMCs. Immunoblots revealed that the expression of the ouabain-sensitive alpha(2)-subunit of Na(+) pumps, but not the predominant, ouabain-resistant alpha(1)-subunit, was increased (2.5-fold vs. NT ASMCs) as was Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger-1 (NCX1; 6-fold vs. NT) in OH arteries. Ca(2+) entry, activated by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) store depletion with cyclopiazonic acid (SR Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor) or caffeine, was augmented in OH ASMCs. This reflected an augmented expression of 2.5-fold in OH ASMCs of C-type transient receptor potential TRPC1, an essential component of store-operated channels (SOCs); two other components of some SOCs were not expressed (TRPC4) or were not upregulated (TRPC5). Ba(2+) entry activated by the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol [a measure of receptor-operated channel (ROC) activity] was much greater in OH than NT ASMCs. This correlated with a sixfold upregulation of TRPC6 protein, a ROC family member. Importantly, in primary cultured mesenteric ASMCs from normal rats, 72-h treatment with 100 nM ouabain significantly augmented NCX1 and TRPC6 protein expression and increased resting [Ca(2+)](cyt) and ROC activity. SOC activity was also increased. Silencer RNA knockdown of NCX1 markedly downregulated TRPC6 and eliminated the ouabain-induced augmentation; silencer RNA knockdown of TRPC6 did not affect NCX1 expression but greatly attenuated its upregulation by ouabain. Clearly, NCX1 and TRPC6 expression are interrelated. Thus, prolonged ouabain treatment upregulates the Na(+) pump alpha(2)-subunit-NCX1-TRPC6 (ROC) Ca(2+) signaling pathway in arterial myocytes in vitro as well as in vivo. This may explain the augmented myogenic responses and enhanced phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in OH arteries (83) as well as the high blood pressure in OH rats.
A case of meningitis occurring in a 37 year old woman with Sj√∂gren's syndrome, seropositive arthritis, and a possible overlap syndrome soon after starting sulphasalazine and after subsequent rechallenge is reported.
Expression of an estrogen-regulated reporter gene, growth of MCF-7 cells in the presence of 17beta-estradiol (E2) or E2 plus TCDD, and DNA microarray plus real time quantitative PCR analyses of gene expression in MCF-7 cells were used to evaluate the effects of TCDD, a known E2 antagonist, on E2-regulated gene expression in human cells. TCDD added simultaneously with E2 exhibited significantly decreased E2-associated upregulation of reporter gene expression compared with cells treated with E2 alone, and decreased E2 enhancement of mitosis in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells treated with E2 or E2 plus TCDD and DNA microarray-evaluated to determine patterns of gene expression, showed substantial differences in gene expression in TCDD-treated cells compared with E2-treated cells. Of the 2400 genes on the Perkin Elmer global array microchip utilized for this analysis, a minimum of 317 were significantly upregulated and 488 were significantly downregulated. Of these, the gene encoding insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the protein product of which has been previously reported to be decreased, missing, altered, or defective in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus, was evaluated by real time quantitative PCR to corroborate the array data. An evaluation of the potential consequences of TCDD-altered IRS-1 downregulation is presented.
Mancozeb, a commonly used fungicide, has been shown to induce tumours in mouse skin and maneb, unit constituent of mancozeb, is reported to induce tumours in rats. The mechanism by which mancozeb induced tumorigenicity is not known. Since the levels of inositol phospholipids and phosphatidic acid have roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, the effects of mancozeb on the levels of these lipids were studied in rats. Daily oral administration of commercial grade mancozeb at a concentration of 50 mg/kg body wt for 30 days (5 days a week) caused no significant change in the levels of inositol phospholipids and phosphatidic acid (PA) in both cerebrum and liver, while at high concentration (250 mg/kg body wt) under the same treatment schedule mancozeb increased the levels of these lipids. In cerebrum, the levels of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and PA were increased by 36 and 43% respectively without affecting the levels of polyphosphoinositides, whereas in liver the levels of not only PI (50%) and PA (49%) but also those of polyphosphoinositides were increased. These results show that mancozeb influences the levels of PA and inositol phospholipids, involved in phospholipase C-pathway of signalling.
1 The effect of pindolol administered to twenty-six patients with hypertension of unknown origin was compared with respect to blood pressure and plasma renin activity change after increase of the dose over a period of 6 weeks. 2 There was no clear correlation between the fall of plasma renin activity, which in some patients was very marked, and the fall in blood pressure. Some patients with a fall in plasma renin activity did not drop their pressure. Conversely, some with a fall of pressure did not drop their plasma renin activity. 3 The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to the pindolol finally caused further lowering of the blood pressure in all but one patient and the plasma renin activity rose in all but two patinets. There was no clear correlation between change in plasma renin activity and the effect on blood pressure.
Mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) are responsible for 20% of familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and mutant SOD1 has been shown to have increased surface hydrophobicity in vitro. Mutant SOD1 may adopt a complex array of conformations with varying toxicity in vivo. We have used a novel fluorescence-based proteomic assay using 4,4'-bis-1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (bisANS) to assess the surface hydrophobicity, and thereby distinguish between different conformations, of SOD1 and other proteins in situ.
Covalent bisANS labeling of spinal cord extracts revealed that alterations in surface hydrophobicity of H46R/H48Q mutations in SOD1 provoke formation of high molecular weight SOD1 species with lowered solubility, likely due to increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. BisANS was docked on the H46R/H48Q SOD1 structure at the disordered copper binding and electrostatic loops of mutant SOD1, but not non-mutant WT SOD1. 16 non-SOD1 proteins were also identified that exhibited altered surface hydrophobicity in the H46R/H48Q mutant mouse model of ALS, including proteins involved in energy metabolism, cytoskeleton, signaling, and protein quality control. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) were also enriched in the detergent-insoluble fractions with SOD1. Given that chaperones recognize proteins with exposed hydrophobic surfaces as substrates and the importance of protein homeostasis in ALS, we crossed SOD1 H46R/H48Q mutant mice with mice over-expressing the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcription factor. Here we showed that HSF1 over-expression in H46R/H48Q ALS mice enhanced proteostasis as evidenced by increased expression of HSPs in motor neurons and astrocytes and increased solubility of mutant SOD1. HSF1 over-expression significantly reduced body weight loss, delayed ALS disease onset, decreases cases of early disease, and increased survival for the 25th percentile in an H46R/H48Q SOD1 background. HSF1 overexpression did not affect macroautophagy in the ALS background, but was associated with maintenance of carboxyl terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP) expression which declined in H46R/H48Q mice.
Our results uncover the potential importance of changes in protein surface hydrophobicity of SOD1 and other non-SOD1 proteins in ALS, and how strategies that activate HSF1 are valid therapies for ALS and other age-associated proteinopathies.
Retinoid X receptor (RXR) forms heterodimers with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs, with subtypes of alpha, delta and gamma), and the heterodimers can be activated by either an RXR or a PPAR subtype-specific ligand. Based on the chemical structure of the RXR natural ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), we designed and synthesized a retinoid-like compound, CS018. In vitro characterizations by cell-based reporter gene assays indicated that CS018 activated RXR homodimers and the heterodimers of RXR with PPARs, but not with farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) and liver X-activated receptor (LXR). Furthermore, RT-PCR results showed that CS018 induced the expression of the PPARgamma target genes, CD36 and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In vivo studies on the diabetic db/db mice demonstrated that CS018 dramatically lowered the animal blood glucose levels. CS018 thus may represent a new retinoid-like compound that activates RXR/PPARs and has potential therapeutic applications in type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases.
In a double-blind study using sodium lactate and isoproterenol infusions to provoke panic attacks, 73 of 86 panic disorder patients and 10 of 45 controls panicked with lactate, and 58 of 86 patients and 4 of 45 controls panicked with isoproterenol. We measured baseline and peak anxiety ratings in 10 controls with lactate-induced panic attacks, 31 controls who did not panic during lactate infusions, and 63 panic disorder patients who did panic during lactate infusions. The controls who panicked with lactate had robust increases in their anxiety ratings very similar to the increases experienced by patients who panicked with lactate.
Exposure during pregnancy to alcohol (ethanol) produces a number of adverse effects. One of them is fetal alcohol syndrome. The hallmark of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is craniofacial dysmorphism and the changes in craniofacial measurement are dependent on the alcoholic dose and its time of exposure. Since prenatal ethanol exposure can alter craniofacial development in rodents and reliably produce long-term behavioral effect in them, the present study was designed to extend the same changes in the Sprague Dawley species.
The albino rat was studied to determine whether gestational exposure to alcohol (Ethanol) produces permanent craniofacial effect. On gestational day (GD7-10) 25% ethanol was injected intraperitoneally to pregnant rats. Various dimensions for skull and face of adult male rats were taken.
Both vertical and coronal dimensions were altered in the exposed animals.
This study demonstrates that exposure to ethanol on a critical gestational period produces permanent craniofacial defects.
Although progesterone (P4) has been implicated to offer protection against ovarian cancer (OCa), little is known of its mechanism of action. The goal of this study was to identify P4-regulated genes that have anti-OCa action. Three immortalized nontumorigenic human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cell lines and three OCa (OVCA) cell lines were subjected to 5 days of P4 treatment. Transcriptional profiling with a cDNA microarray containing approximately 2400 known genes was used to identify genes (1) whose expression was consistently downregulated in OVCA cell lines compared to HOSE cell lines, and (2) whose expression was restored in OCa cell lines by P4 treatment. From the candidates selected, activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3), caveolin-1, deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1), and nonmetastatic clone 23 (NM23-H2) were chosen for post hoc functional studies based on their previously reported action as tumor suppressors or apoptosis inducers. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed loss of or reduced transcription of these genes in OVCA cells when compared to HOSE cells and their upregulation following P4 treatment. Hormonal specificity was demonstrated by blockade experiments with a progestin antagonist RU 38486. Ectopic expression of caveolin-1, DLC-1, and NM23-H2 caused growth inhibition in OVCA cell cultures, but not in HOSE cell cultures, while forced expression of ATF-3 suppressed growth in both. Overexpression of AFT-3 also enhanced caspase-3 activity in both HOSE and OVCA cells, whereas ectopic expression of caveolin-1 and DLC-1 only activated this enzyme in OCa cells. In contrast, NM23-H2 overexpression was ineffective in activating caspase-3. Overexpression of any of the four genes in OCa cells reduced soft-agar colony formation and cell invasiveness. Taken together, we have identified four new P4-regulated, antitumor genes for OCa. However, their modes of action differ significantly; ATF-3 primarily functions as an apoptosis inducer, NM23-H2 as a suppressor of cell motility, and caveolin-1 and DLC-1 exhibiting features of classical tumor suppressors. To the best of our knowledge, except for NM23-H2, this is the first report linking P4 to the regulation of these tumor suppressor/proapoptotic genes, which could serve as future therapeutic targets.
Three newborn infants are presented in this case report who developed severe calcifications in the thighs after intramuscular injections of vitamin E. The prognosis seems to be good. Calcifications disappeared without clinical residue.
To study the therapeutic effect of exogenous interleukin-10 on CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats and its possible mechanisms.
Fourty-seven SD rats were randomly divided into control group (group N) and CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis model group (group C). After CCl4 was given for 9 wk, the model group was divided into three groups. Rats in group M were put to death immediately,rats in group T were treated with IL-10 for another three wk and then put to death, rats in group R recovered after three weeks and were then killed. The degree of hepatic fibrosis was measured by HE staining and histological activity index (HAI). Histological activity index (HAI), change of collagen types I and III were measured by Picrosirius staining. The expression of TNF-alpha, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in liver tissue was measured by S-P immunohistochemistry.
CCl4- induced experimental rat hepatic fibrosis model was established successfully. The degree of hepatic fibrosis was markedly lower in group T than in groups M and R, and there was no difference between the two groups. The expression of collagen types I and III was significantly suppressed in group T and was slightly suppressed in groups M and R. The positive levels of TNF-alpha, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in group M increased significantly compared to those in group N (P<0.01). The positive signals decreased significantly in groups T and R (P<0.01),but positive score was significantly lower in group T than in group R (P<0.01).
Exogenous IL-10 can reverse CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. IL-10 may exert its reversible effects on hepatic fibrosis by blocking CCl4-induced inflammation,inhibiting expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-1 and promoting resolution of collagen types I and III.
The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in levodopa-induced dyskinesia are unclear. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson disease, the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous apomorphine infusion. rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce drug-induced dyskinesias, whereas 5-Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase.
