The effect of citalopram (CTP) a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor agent was studied on ouabain-induced arrhythmia in spontaneously beating isolated guinea-pig atria. CTP (2-32 microg/ml) produced a dose-dependent decrease in the force of contractions (7-62%), and in the rate of contractions (11-72%). Pre-administration of the atria with CTP inhibited the ouabain-induced arrhythmia in isolated atria. Ouabain alone (1.2 microg/ml) produced arrhythmia at 4.5 min, and asystole at 20.7 min. Pretreatment with CTP (8 microg/ml) significantly increased the time of onset of arrhythmia to 9.5 min. In addition CTP prolonged the beating of atria (survival time) to more than 56 min, and inhibited the occurrence of asystole. These findings indicate that CTP produces direct cardiac action, probably due to the inhibition of cardiac Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels. Moreover our results suggest that CTP may reduce the membrane conductance through inhibition of ionic channels which decrease ouabain-induced arrhythmia.
A presumptive case of metronidazole toxicity in a 3.4-kg adult cat is described. The cat had been treated for suspected inflammatory bowel disease with an anti-inflammatory dose of prednisone and metronidazole (73.5-147 mg/kg PO q24h) for approximately 40 days prior to presentation. Clinical signs were primarily related to the central nervous system, including acute tetraparesis, unresponsiveness, tremors, and vocalization. The patient was euthanatized after 12 days of supportive care. Necropsy revealed no significant macroscopic lesions. Histologic evaluation revealed multifocal, fairly well-demarcated foci of necrosis in the brainstem, extending from the diencephalon to the medulla oblongata. To our knowledge, this is the first report to document histologic lesions associated with metronidazole administration in a cat.
Liver transplantation in patients with severe portopulmonary hypertension (PPH) has been associated with mortality rates in the range of 70% to 80%. Preoperative long-term epoprostenol therapy reverses pulmonary hypertension and may be a valuable possibility to reduce mortality in patients with severe PPH undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. We want to report a patient with severe PPH, who was treated with intravenous epoprostenol for an 8-month period, after which pulmonary vascular resistance had decreased from 12 to 3 Wood units. Nevertheless, the patient developed intractable perioperative right heart failure necessitating transient mechanical circulatory support. The patient was weaned from mechanical circulatory support, but died from another episode of acute right heart failure after 28 days. Complicated liver transplantation associated with major cardiovascular stress is obviously not tolerated in patients with severe portopulmonary hypertension even after preoperative long-term epoprostenol therapy.
A nationwide study of aplastic anemia in Israel revealed a mean yearly incidence of 7.1/1,000,000 in males and 8.7/1,000,000 in females. Twenty-five per cent of the cases reported had an apparent chloramphenicol etiology. Ten patients, five treated with chloramphenicol and five without it, developed acute leukemia. The median survival was 11 months in males and 28 in females. Survival was particularly inferior in chloramphenicol-related cases, suggesting that this group constitutes a specific entity.
Reversible cerebral angiopathy (RCA) is responsible for disabling headache and potential stroke complications. Most patients respond poorly to analgesics. We describe four patients with typical RCA whose headache rapidly disappeared after IV nimodipine treatment was initiated.
Spontaneous or propranolol-induced hypoglycemia can occur in uremic humans. We studied glucose kinetics (using [3-3H]glucose) in five uremic humans 24 h after hemodialysis and in seven normal controls. The effect of glucagon infusion at rates of 3, 6, 12, and 18 ng X kg-1 X min-1 at 60-min intervals was compared with either saline or beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol infusion). In uremics, plasma glucose increased by 20-25% and by 40-50% at the 3 and 6 ng X kg-1 X min-1 glucagon doses, respectively, with no further increases at higher infusion rates. Glucose production increased transiently and in tandem with glucose uptake at each glucagon increment (P less than 0.0001). During beta-adrenergic blockade, the effect of glucagon in stimulating glucose production was blunted by 14-24% at the 6-18 ng X kg-1 X min-1 doses (P less than 0.05). During saline infusion, plasma insulin concentrations increased progressively to peak levels fourfold above basal at the 18 ng X kg-1 X min-1 dose. This increase in plasma insulin was virtually abolished by concomitant beta-adrenergic blockade (P = 0.0002). In contrast to uremic subjects, normal controls exhibited lesser degrees of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia at all glucagon infusion rates. Propranolol infusion had no effect on the increments in glucose production and uptake nor on the plasma insulin response. These results suggest that in uremic humans propranolol independently reduces the hepatic response to glucagon and the insulin secretory response to hyperglycemia and/or hyperglucagonemia. These observations provide a possible mechanism for the adrenergic regulation of glucose homeostasis in uremia.
Capecitabine is a drug that requires the consecutive action of three enzymes: carboxylesterase 2 (CES 2), cytidine deaminase (CDD), and thymidine phosphorylase (TP) for transformation into 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The metabolism of 5FU requires the activity of thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) among other enzymes. The present study prospectively examined the possible relationship between the toxicity and efficacy of capecitabine and 14 different polymorphisms in CES 2, CDD, TS and DPD. Between 2003 and 2005, a total of 136 patients with advanced breast or colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine were prospectively enrolled. The presence of two polymorphisms (CDD 943insC and CES 2 Exon3 6046 G/A) were associated with a non-statistically significant higher incidence of grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (p=0.07) and grade 3-4 diarrhoea (p=0.09), respectively. Patients heterozygous or homozygous for the polymorphism CES 2 5'UTR 823 C/G exhibited a significantly greater response rate to capecitabine, and time to progression of disease (59%, 8.7 months) than patients with the wild type gene sequence (32%, p=0.015; 5.3 months, p=0.014). For the first time, an association between a polymorphism in the CES2 gene and the efficacy of capecitabine has been described, providing preliminary evidence of its predictive and prognostic value.
Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE) has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine and today is used as an herbal supplement touted for improving neural function and for its antioxidant and anticancer effects. Herbal supplements have the potential for consumption over extended periods of time, with a general lack of sufficient data on long-term carcinogenicity risk. Exposure of B6C3F1 mice to GBE in the 2-year National Toxicology Program carcinogenicity bioassay resulted in a dose-dependent increase in hepatocellular tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We show that the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in GBE exposed animals is complex, involving alterations in H-ras and Ctnnb1 mutation spectra, WNT pathway dysregulation, and significantly altered gene expression associated with oncogenesis, HCC development, and chronic xenobiotic and oxidative stress compared to spontaneous HCC. This study provides a molecular context for the genetic changes associated with hepatocarcinogenesis in GBE exposed mice and illustrates the marked differences between these tumors and those arising spontaneously in the B6C3F1 mouse. The molecular changes observed in HCC from GBE-treated animals may be of relevance to those seen in human HCC and other types of cancer, and provide important data on potential mechanisms of GBE hepatocarcinogenesis.
Osteoporosis associated with estrogen deficiency is defined as an abnormal decrease in bone mass leading to an increased fracture risk. Genistein (GEN), as a phytoestrogen, is a type of soybean-derived isoflavone that possesses structural similarity to estrogen. In this study, we assessed the effect of GEN in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. To determine the effect of GEN on bone metabolism, we investigated gene expression profiles using a radioactive cDNA microarray. Eight-week-old female mice were either sham operated (SHAM) or OVX. From 1 week after the operation, OVX mice were injected daily with intraperitoneal GEN (0.1, 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/day) or 17beta-estradiol (E2, 0.03 microg/day) for 4 weeks. A cDNA microarray was used to evaluate changes in the expression of 1,152 genes. OVX mice showed bone mineral density (BMD) loss versus SHAM mice (5.8+/-0.4 vs. 6.9+/-0.6 mg/cm2). However, femur BMDs were completely restored by GEN and by E2 administration in OVX mice. Serum osteocalcin in OVX mice treated with 0.5 mg/day of GEN was 1.6-fold (44.30+/-5.73 ng/ml) higher than that in untreated mice. GEN treatment up-regulated 38 genes (e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase 10) and down-regulated 18 (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase 13). Moreover, GEN was found to have a protective effect on bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency in OVX mice. The present study suggests that GEN modulates bone metabolism-related gene expression, including calciotropic receptor, cytokines, growth factors and bone matrix proteins.
Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic agent which causes severe nephrotoxicity. Studies have suggested that reactive oxygen species, mainly generated in mitochondria, play a central role in cisplatin-induced renal damage. A wide range of antioxidants have been evaluated as possible protective agents against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity; however a safe and efficacious compound has not yet been found. The present study is the first to evaluate the protective potential of carvedilol, a beta-blocker with strong antioxidant properties, against the mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis in kidney of rats treated with cisplatin. The following cisplatin-induced toxic effects were prevented by carvedilol: increased plasmatic levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN); lipid peroxidation, oxidation of cardiolipin; oxidation of protein sulfhydryls; depletion of the non-enzymatic antioxidant defense and increased activity of caspase-3. Carvedilol per se did not present any effect on renal mitochondria. It was concluded that carvedilol prevents mitochondrial dysfunction and renal cell death through the protection against the oxidative stress and redox state unbalance induced by cisplatin. The association of carvedilol to cisplatin chemotherapy was suggested as a possible strategy to minimize the nephrotoxicity induced by this antitumor agent.
Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin. Increasing evidence demonstrates that physiological supply of folic acid during pregnancy prevents folic acid deficiency-related neural tube defects (NTDs). Previous studies showed that maternal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure caused NTDs in rodents. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high-dose folic acid supplementation during pregnancy on LPS-induced NTDs. Pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (20 μg/kg/d) from gestational day (GD) 8 to GD12. As expected, a five-day LPS injection resulted in 19.96% of fetuses with NTDs. Interestingly, supplementation with folic acid (3mg/kg/d) during pregnancy significantly alleviated LPS-induced NTDs. Additionally, folic acid significantly attenuated LPS-induced fetal growth restriction and skeletal malformations. Additional experiment showed that folic acid attenuated LPS-induced glutathione (GSH) depletion in maternal liver and placentas. Moreover, folic acid significantly attenuated LPS-induced expression of placental MyD88. Additionally, folic acid inhibited LPS-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation in placentas. Correspondingly, folic acid significantly attenuated LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 in placentas, maternal serum and amniotic fluid. In conclusion, supplementation with high-dose folic acid during pregnancy protects against LPS-induced NTDs through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects.
The PEX6 (peroxisome assembly factor-2, PAF-2) gene encodes a member of the AAA protein (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family and restores peroxisome assembly in fibroblasts from peroxisome biogenesis disorder patients belonging to complementation group C (group 4 in the United States). We have now clarified the genomic DNA structure of human PEX6 and identified mutations in patients from various ethnic groups. The human PEX6 gene consists of 17 exons and 16 introns, spanning about 14kb. The largest exon, exon 1, has at least 952 bp nucleotides. Eleven novel mutations (18 alleles) were identified by direct sequencing of the PEX6 cDNA from 10 patients. All these mutations have been confirmed in the corresponding genomic DNA. There was no common mutation, but an exon skip was identified in two unrelated Japanese patients. Most of the mutations led to premature termination or large deletions of the PEX6 protein and resulted in the most severe peroxisome biogenesis disorder phenotype of Zellweger syndrome. A patient with an atypical Zellweger syndrome had a missense mutation that was shown to disrupt the cell's ability to form peroxisomes. This mutation analysis will aid in understanding the functions of the PEX6 protein in peroxisomal biogenesis. Hum Mutat 13:487-496, 1999.
Treatment with high-dose cytarabine (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine) is often associated with an acute febrile reaction sometimes including abdominal pain, myalgia, and rash. The similarity of these symptoms to those caused by hypersecretion of cytokines in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) prompted us to investigate the plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines during treatment of children with high-dose cytarabine.
Sixteen children treated for hematological malignancies and in clinical remission were studied during treatment with six infusions of cytarabine given every 12 hr at a dose of 2 g/m(2). Blood samples for analysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-1gamma (IL-1gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were obtained prior to treatment and subsequently at 12, 36 and 60 hr. Additional samples were collected as soon as fever occurred.
Thirteen of 16 patients developed fever at a median time of 30 hr following start of treatment. At 12 hr levels of TNF-alpha were elevated followed by a rise in IL-6, IFN-alpha, and IL-1ra, peaking at the onset of fever. Thereafter these levels slowly declined whereas low IL-10 levels became detectable.
We conclude that high-dose cytarabine treatment often induces release of TNF-alpha followed by the sequential release of other proinflammatory cytokines. Most likely these cytokines mediate the development of symptoms comprising the cytarabine syndrome.
Herbal medication use is common in many cultural groups. Because these products are unregulated, the potential for significant toxicity exists. We report a case of aplastic anemia associated with the use of an herbal medication by a 12-year-old boy. On analysis, the herbal medication was found to contain phenylbutazone, which has been strongly associated with the production of similar hematologic abnormalities. The medication was not listed as an ingredient and no warning was present on the box.
Imbalances of Th1- and Th2-type responses have been postulated to be a predisposing factor for both humoral and cellular mediated autoimmune diseases. To further define their roles in systemic autoimmunity, IL-4 and IFN-gamma gene knockout mice were studied for susceptibility to the prototypic Th2-mediated mercury-induced autoimmunity. A predominant Th2-type response following HgCl2 treatment of wild-type B10.S mice was confirmed by the findings of a significant increase in splenic IL-4 and hypergammaglobulinemia primarily of the IgG1 isotype, without an increase in IFN-gamma levels. Paradoxically, IL-4-deficient mice developed the characteristic anti-nucleolar autoantibodies and tissue deposition of immune complexes, while IFN-gamma-deficient mice had very low autoantibody levels and essentially normal immunohistology. Studies to define defects in Ab responses of IFN-gamma-deficient mice, using the T-dependent Ag (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl, revealed an attenuated IgG response to low and to a lesser extent high doses of (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl-hemocyanin, but maintenance of affinity maturation. These results indicate that Th1/Th2 imbalance does not directly play a role in susceptibility to mercury-induced autoimmunity, and suggest that the dependence on Th1-type responses in certain autoimmune diseases is due to the requirement for IFN-gamma for Ab production to weakly antigenic self molecules.
Blockade of angiotensin II receptors was first achieved in the 1970s using a peptide, saralasin acetate. Although it was effective in lowering blood pressure, it required parenteral administration and had a short duration of action and partial agonist activity. These disadvantages are absent with losartan, a selective, orally administered, nonpeptide blocker of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor that recently became available for clinical use. Losartan has a sustained duration of action, permitting once-daily dosing in many patients, and lacks partial agonist activity. More than 3300 hypertensive patients have received losartan in Phase III, controlled clinical trials. Losartan given concomitantly with a low dose (12.5 mg) of hydrochlorothiazide further reduces blood pressure. Its overall incidence of adverse experiences is similar to that of placebo. Because of its efficacy, specificity, duration of action, and safety profile, losartan should be considered as first-line therapy for the treatment of patients with hypertension.
Vincristine is considered as a backbone of therapy in the induction and consolidation phases of pediatric malignancies. Neurotoxicity is a principal side effect of its use. This study is a randomized single-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the role of glutamic acid in ameliorating neurotoxicity in pediatric patients with hematologic and solid tumors receiving vincristine during induction course. Fifty-four patients in the glutamic acid group received glutamic acid 1.5 grams daily orally in 3 divided doses during the 4-week induction with vincristine in a dose of 1.5 mg/m² IV weekly. Placebo group (40 patients) received oral placebo 3 times daily in the same way as the glutamic acid group. The onset of neurotoxicity was significantly earlier in placebo group than in glutamic acid group regarding tendon Achilles reflex, Patellar reflex, parasthesia, and increased frequency of constipation. This was statistically significant mostly in third and fourth visits, no severe cases of strength and mental alteration side effects in both groups. Glutamic acid was well tolerated with no gastrointestinal side effects in patients. This study suggests that the coadministration of oral glutamic acid with repetitive intravenous bolus injections of vincristine resulted in a reduction of its neurotoxicity.
A patient developed a severe cholinergic syndrome from the use of echothiophate iodide ophthalmic drops, presented with profound muscle weakness and was initially given the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Red blood cell and serum cholinesterase levels were severely depressed and symptoms resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of the eye drops.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) may be an ideal candidate disease for in utero gene therapy as disrupted fetal lung growth plays a significant role in disease outcome. We previously demonstrated that transient in utero overexpression of CFTR during fetal development resulted in lung epithelial proliferation and differentiation. We hypothesized that gene therapy with CFTR would improve the pulmonary hypoplasia associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). CDH was induced by the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenyl-4-nitrophyl ether (nitrofen) following maternal ingestion at either 10 or 13 days gestation. In utero gene transfer of the CFTR gene was subsequently performed at 16 days gestation. Examination of the fetuses at 22 days gestation revealed little improvement in the CFTR-treated lungs following induction of hernias with nitrofen at 10 days gestation. However, the CFTR gene treatment significantly improved internal surface area, saccular density, overall saccular number, and amount of saccular air space in the lungs that were treated with nitrofen at 13 days gestation. RT-PCR demonstrated that gene transfer occurred following treatment at 13 days gestation but not in the lungs treated with nitrofen at 10 days gestation, despite gene transfer at the same gestational age (16 days) in both groups. As disruption of lung development correlates with the gestational stage at which nitrofen exposure occurs, these results confirmed previous findings that in utero gene transfer efficiency depends on the stage of lung development. Lung development may be significantly delayed in human CDH to allow for successful gene transfer later in gestation, providing a substantial therapeutic window.
Thalidomide is increasingly being used for the treatment of a variety of dermatologic conditions. Some of the risks associated with thalidomide use, however, are still being uncovered. Increased incidence of venous thrombosis following thalidomide use has recently been reported in the treatment of diseases with disease-related thrombotic risks, such as malignancy and lupus with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We report a case of venous thrombosis resulting from thalidomide use in a patient with cicatricial pemphigoid, illustrating the potential concern for increased thrombosis following thalidomide use in the dermatology setting.
A 61-year-old patient who had been treated with lisinopril in the past without any problems was commenced on ramipril for left ventricular dysfunction. He developed a painful symmetrical purpuric eruption over both feet after three days. A full vasculitis screen was negative. Ramipril was stopped and he required a course of steroids after which the rash improved slowly. The ACE inhibitors can cause various skin side effects; however, it rarely causes cutaneous vasculitis. Ramipril-induced cutaneous vasculitis is particularly rare and our case was atypical because the patient had tolerated lisinopril before. Previous successful treatment with one ACE inhibitor does not rule out the vasculitis caused by the drug from the same group. Here we report ramipril-induced cutaneous vasculitis in a patient who required steroid therapy to control it.
Epidurally administered midazolam can potentiate analgesia by epidural bupivacaine. However, whether this effect is synergistic or additive is not known. In this study, we investigated the spinally-mediated analgesic interaction between midazolam and bupivacaine by using the tail-flick and formalin tests in rats with chronically implanted catheters. Behavioral effects were also observed. The dose dependency of analgesia and the 50% effective doses of intrathecal midazolam and bupivacaine were determined, and then the interaction of these two drugs was examined with an isobolographic analysis. Both drugs had dose-dependent analgesic effects in both the tail-flick test and the formalin test. The 50% effective dose values of the combination were significantly lower than the calculated additive values in both tests (P = 0.023 in the tail-flick test; P = 0.0025 in Phase 1 and 0.047 in Phase 2 of the formalin test). Behavioral side effects decreased in the combination group compared with each drug alone. In conclusion, intrathecally administered midazolam and bupivacaine had synergistic analgesic effects on acute thermal- or inflammatory-induced pain, with decreased behavioral side effects.
In both acute thermal- and inflammatory-induced pain, intrathecally administered midazolam and bupivacaine produced synergistic analgesia with decreased side effects in intrathecally catheterized rats.
Oral disopyramide given prophylactically following myocardial infarction has been compared with placebo in a double-blind trial using continuous-tape monoriting of the electocardiogram. It caused a significant reduction in the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and of the various degrees of heart-block. There was a significant reduction of reinfarction during hospital stay in patients who had received disopyramide. Disopyramide appears to be a safe and effective oral therapy in the prevention of potentially serious arrhythmias following myocardial infarction.
Sulfasalazine salicylazosulfapyridine (SASP), consisting of 5-aminosalicylic acid bound to sulfapyridine by a diazo bond, is an effective drug in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, its mechanism of action remains a matter of debate. The objective of our work was to investigate SASP's effect on NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway in transcriptional regulation level. Repeated colitis was induced by administration of 4 cycles of 4% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS); The severity of colitis was assessed on the basis of clinical signs, colon length, and histology scores. Moreover, sIgA and haptoglobin (HP) were analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and ICAM-1 gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using SYBA green I. NF-kappaB signal transduction proteins and transcriptional factor p65 interaction with promoter of ICAM-1 were assessed by western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. SASP administration significantly attenuated the colitis signs and caused substantial reductions of HP expression, and maintained the level of cecum sIgA. SASP inhibited ICAM-1 gene expression and had no effect on MIF gene expression. Also, SASP was able to reduce p-IkBalpha protein expression; however, no change in the activation of IKKalpha, IKKbeta, p65, and IKBalpha was noted. SASP inhibited p65 recruitment to the gene ICAM-1 promoter. In conclusion, inhibition of NF-kappaB pathway signal proteins and blockade of p65 binding to gene ICAM-1 promoter might explain the effect and mechanisms of SASP at alleviating DSS-induced colitis in mice.
In this article, we describe a case of a man without diabetes with a long history of amiodarone use. He presented with a foot deformity and plantar ulceration. Examination showed him to have a symmetrical peripheral neuropathy and findings consistent with a Charcot foot. Extensive investigations failed to find other causes for his neuropathy, other than his amiodarone use. We believe that this is the first reported case of a neuropathic foot deformity and ulceration occurring with amiodarone use, and we feel that it is important to point out the association of this commonly used antiarrythmic drug with this form of neuropathic osteoarthropathy.

Azathioprine treatment benefited 19 (66%) out of 29 patients suffering from severe psoriasis. Haematological complications were not troublesome and results of biochemical liver function tests remained normal. Minimal cholestasis was seen in two cases and portal fibrosis of a reversible degree in eight. Liver biopsies should be undertaken at regular intervals if azathioprine therapy is continued so that structural liver damage may be detected at an early and reversible stage.
Flutamide is a non-steroidal anti-androgen used in the treatment of prostate cancer, usually in combination with LHRH-analogs. Incidence of hepatotoxicity associated to Flutamide in the literature is very low and does not exceed 0.18%. Between February 1989 and December 1994, the FDA was reported 20 cases of patients who had died and 26 who had been hospitalized due to hepatotoxicity secondary to Flutamide. We contribute two cases of patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma following treatment with flutamide and LHRH-analogs who presented liver failure; one with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis that recovered after discontinuation of the drug, and a second one who developed micronodular cirrhosis and later died of icteroascitic decompensation and hepatorenal syndrome. Including a review of the literature, the paper comments on the likely biological mechanisms for liver toxicity caused by Flutamide. The authors conclude that clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients who either will receive or are receiving treatment with Flutamide is necessary, and withdrawal of drug imperative as soon as certain symptoms of hepatic dysfunction become apparent.
High-dose opioid therapy can precipitate seizures; however, the mechanism of such a dangerous adverse effect remains poorly understood. The aim of our study was to determine whether the neuroexcitatory activity of high-dose morphine is mediated by selective stimulation of opioid receptors.
Mice hippocampi were resected intact and bathed in low magnesium artificial cerebrospinal fluid to induce spontaneous seizure-like events recorded from CA1 neurons.
Application of morphine had a biphasic effect on the recorded spontaneous seizure-like events. In a low concentration (10 microM), morphine depressed electrographic seizure activity. Higher morphine concentrations (30 and 100 microM) enhanced seizure activity in an apparent dose-dependent manner. Naloxone, a nonselective opiate antagonist blocked the proconvulsant action of morphine. Selective mu and kappa opiate receptor agonists and antagonists enhanced and suppressed the spontaneous seizure activity, respectively. On the contrary, delta opioid receptor ligands did not have an effect.
The proseizure effect of morphine is mediated through selective stimulation of mu and kappa opiate receptors but not the activation of the delta receptor system. The observed dose-dependent mechanism of morphine neuroexcitation underscores careful adjustment and individualized opioid dosing in the clinical setting.
