The contact phase of blood coagulation in a group of patients suffering from essential hypertension was studied before and after captopril administration. The baseline levels of factor XII, factor XI and plasminogen were significantly higher than in normals and correlated with baseline diastolic blood pressure levels. On the contrary, plasma prekallikrein was not significantly different from normal. These results suggest the presence of a hypercoagulable state in essential hypertension. After captopril administration, factor XII, factor XI and prekallikrein rapidly decreased, perhaps as a consequence of the drug's effect on the vascular endothelial surface. There was no correlation between the changes of active and inactive renin and the changes of prekallikrein and plasminogen levels. Our data do not support the view that factor XII-plasma kallikrein or plasmin dependent pathways are involved in the activation of inactive renin in vivo. Captopril, by provoking rapid pressure changes, appears to be able to affect the clotting system.
The effectiveness of near-infrared imaging (NIR) interrogation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression as a sensitive biomarker of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) response to arsenic trioxide therapy was studied in mice.
A431 OSCC in vitro were exposed to 0 µM, 0.5 µM, 2.5 µM, or 5 µM of As(2)O(3) for 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed EGFR expression and demonstrated a sensitivity dose-related signal decline with As(2)O(3) treatment. Next, mice with pharynx-implanted A431 cells received As(2)O(3) i.p. every 48 h at 0.0, 0.5, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg/day (n = 6/group) from day 0 to 10. An intravenous NIR probe, EGF-Cy5.5, was injected at baseline and on days 4, 8, and 12 for dynamic NIR imaging. Tumor volume and body weights were measured three times weekly.
In vitro, A431 EGFR expression was well appreciated in the controls and decreased (p<0.05) with increasing As(2)O(3) dose and treatment duration. In vivo EGFR NIR tumor signal intensity decreased (p<0.05) in As(2)O(3) treated groups versus controls from days 4 to 12, consistent with increasing dosage. Tumor volume diminished in a dose-related manner while body weight was unaffected. Immunohistochemical staining of excised tumors confirmed that EGFR expression was reduced by As(2)O(3) treatment in a dose responsive pattern.
This study demonstrates for the first time that OSCC can be interrogated in vivo by NIR molecular imaging of the EGFR and that this biomarker is effective for the longitudinal assessment of OSCC response to As(2)O(3) treatment.
Low-dose ketamine anaesthesia was compared with neuroleptanaesthesia, in respect of immediate and longer-term psychomimetic reactions, in 40 female patients undergoing elective gynaecological surgery. Qualitatively, but not quantitatively, different psychomimetic reactions occurred in both groups. In the neurolept group the predominant complaint was of a dissociative nature, reported after 24 h by 11 (55%) of the patients, while in the ketamine group the predominant experience was dreaming, reported by eight (40%) of the patients after 24 h. Interviews after 3 months revealed a low frequency of psychomimetic reactions in both groups. However, 30% of all the patients (12) complained of impairment of intellectual function, and in seven patients this was severe enough to interfere with their ability to work.
The authors report the case of a boy with PFIC type 2 or BRIC type 2 who suffered from liver dysfunction at 2 months after birth.
A liver biopsy specimen revealed mild liver cirrhosis, and the findings resembled those observed in Byler disease. Genetic examination revealed a normal familial intrahepatic cholestasis-1 gene, but a heterozygous mutation for the ABCB11, C1620A (F540L), was observed. Therefore, the patient was initially diagnosed with PFIC type 2. For 3 years after the diagnosis, he had severe pruritus, an increased serum bile acid, and normal serum values of gamma-glutamyl transaminase. At the age of 2, treatment with administration of ursodeoxycholic acid was started; subsequently, a gradual improvement in his liver function was observed. At the age of 3, he suffered from massive intestinal and pulmonary hemorrhage, which improved immediately after the administration of vitamin K. He was then admitted to our hospital for liver transplantation. At 1 month after the admission, his liver dysfunction showed further improvement, except for a mild increase in the serum bile acid level. This condition did not show any change during the 5-year follow-up period. In addition, the patient showed severe growth failure and was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency. Hence, he receives growth hormone administration.
The patient could be genetically diagnosed with bile salt export pump disease of PFIC type 2 or BRIC type 2. Various clinical features are observed in PFIC or BRIC patients with ABCB11 mutation.
The hypolipidemic and anti-atheromatous effect of S-methylmethionine sulfonium chloride (Vitamin U, MMSC) were investigated using various experimental procedures. In the results, orally administered MMSC markedly normalized dietary-induced hyperlipidemia in rats and rabbits, demonstrating the lowering effects on plasma total cholesterol, beta-lipoprotein and phospholipids, and no appreciable effect on plasma triglycerides. In normolipidemic and a surfactant-induced hyperlipidemic rats, MMSC did not decrease plasma lipids level, nor MMSC-affected plasma lipoprotein lipase and liver catalase activities. In contrast, clofibrate showed little or no effect on plasma lipids level of dietary-induced hyperlipidemic rats, with exception of plasma triglycerides, whereas clofibrate lowered plasma lipids level in normolipidemic and surfactant-induced hyperlipidemic rats, and enhanced liver catalase activity. From the results, the lipids lowering effects of MMSC using various procedures were clearly differentiated from those of clofibrate. Additionally, the anti-atheromatous effect of MMSC was histopathologically demonstrated in dietary-induced ahteromatous rabbits. A unique hypolipidemic effect of MMSC is discussed from therapeutic viewpoint.
Penicillamine has been successfully reintroduced and continued for a minimum of 13 months in 5 patients who developed proteinuria during the first course of the drug. The daily maintenance dose during the second course was 150--250 mg taken midway between 2 meals. Proteinuria did not recur; no significant excretion of fibrin degradation products occurred; complement, urea, creatinine, and serum albumin remained within normal limits. Urine microscopy showed no abnormality.
Propofol is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic agent. However, cognitive function remains depressed for several hours thereafter. We have evaluated the ability of nefiracetam, a novel cognition-enhancing agent, to alleviate propofol-induced amnesia in a rodent model of learning.
Rats were trained in a one-trial, step-through, light-dark passive avoidance paradigm. Propofol (10 and 75 mg/kg) was administered by the intraperitoneal route at 15 min before training and separately at increasing times in the immediate 0-6 h post-training period (100 and 150 mg/kg). Nefiracetam, 9 mg/kg, was administered by the intraperitoneal route 1 h before training. Animals were tested for recall at the 12 h post-training time, and after their killing, immunocytochemistry was used to determine the increase in hippocampal neuronal polysialylation, an event associated with memory consolidation. Induction and duration of anesthesia induced by propofol was determined using tail pinch and pedal withdrawal reflexes.
Propofol-induced anterograde amnesia occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of retrograde amnesia required a higher dose of propofol, which anesthetized the animals and was effective only in the immediate 3-h post-training period. In the absence of any evident effect on the onset or duration of anesthesia, nefiracetam prevented both forms of propofol-induced amnesia and preserved the learning-associated changes of neuronal polysialylation state.
The ability of nefiracetam to prevent propofol-induced anterograde and retrograde amnesia is proposed to be indirect and to result from modulation of gene transcription in a manner that initiates a cascade of events involving protein synthesis leading to synaptic growth associated with the formation of the long-term memory trace.
The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of initiation of gold therapy on glomerular and tubular integrity. Urine albumin was used as a marker of glomerular damage. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) urinary excretion served as an indicator of proximal tubular damage. This study was an adjunct to a clinical trial that investigated the safety and the efficacy of Depo-Medrone during the induction phase of gold therapy. The NAG activities and albumin levels in the urine of 36 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis treated with sodium aurothiomalate weekly up to a total of 1 g were investigated. NAG was assayed in 565 early morning urine samples of these patients at weekly intervals for 24 weeks. The mean NAG level rose from 50.2 nmol/mg of creatinine on entry to peak NAG excretion of 120.4 nmol/mg of creatinine at week 4 and then fell to 56.3 nmol/mg of creatinine at week 24. Urinary albumin was assayed in 252 early morning urine samples at monthly intervals during gold treatment. Values greater than 20 mg/l were observed in 7.5% of urine samples. Microalbuminuria was present in 9% of patients at baseline. Two patients who were withdrawn because of proteinuria and macroalbuminuria had normoalbuminuria on entry. We conclude that raised levels of NAG associated with tubular damage are more frequent than glomerular damage on entry to, and during, treatment with gold salts.
PS-341 (bortezomib, Velcade), the first proteasome inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential water-soluble vitamin required for many normal physiologic functions and has to be obtained through diet or supplemental tablets in humans. Here we studied the potential effect of vitamin C on the anticancer activity of PS-341 in human cancer cell lines.
The effects of vitamin C on apoptosis induction by PS-341 alone and by PS-341 combined with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand were studied. In addition, the effects of vitamin C and other antioxidants on PS-341-mediated proteasome inhibition were also examined. Finally, the direct chemical interaction between vitamin C and PS-341 was determined.
Vitamin C abrogated the ability of PS-341 to induce apoptosis in various human cancer cell lines, to induce G(2)-M arrest, and to augment apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, vitamin C suppressed PS-341-mediated inhibition of proteasome activity. PS-341 itself did not induce generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species whereas other antioxidants failed to abrogate its biological activity. Importantly, we detected a direct chemical interaction between vitamin C and PS-341.
Vitamin C directly binds to PS-431, thus inactivating PS-341 independent of its antioxidant activity. Our findings suggest that vitamin C may have a negative effect on PS-341-mediated anticancer activity.
Among industrialized countries, the rate of drug-induced liver failure varies widely accounting for about 1-12% of the indications for liver transplantation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are with antibiotics the most frequently involved compounds. In this single-center series of 57 consecutive cases of acute liver failure treated by orthotopic liver transplantation, five were related to NSAIDs-induced liver damage, three being due to nimesulide use. This has to be taken as a further warning about the potential for this compound to induce liver failure.
Although chronic lithium therapy has been associated with a defect in the urinary concentrating mechanism, short-term renal effects of lithium have received little attention in the intact animal. Solute-free water reabsorption (T-cH2O) and free water clearance (CH2O) were measured in primates of the genus Galago under control conditions and while animals were receiving either 0.5 mmol/kg-h or 1.0 mmol/kg-h lithium chloride (135 mM) intravenously. CH2O was unchanged by lithium infusion (P greater than 0.10), whereas T-cH2O was significantly depressed at all levels of osmolal clearance (P smaller than 0.01). Spontaneous recovery of near-normal T-cH2O was documented in two animals within 1 wk following acute lithium infusion. In addition it was observed that lithium-induced depression of T-cH2O could be partially prevented by pretreatment with intravenous amiloride. These results suggest that alterations in the renal concentrating mechanism can occur rapidly following the onset of lithium administration. They also imply that impairment of the renal concentrating mechanism by lithium is due at least in part to antagonism of the action of vasopressin on the collecting duct.
Results of previous studies suggest that renin-angiotensin system blockers might reduce the burden of diabetic retinopathy. We therefore designed the DIabetic REtinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) Programme to assess whether candesartan could reduce the incidence and progression of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes.
Two randomised, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled trials were done in 309 centres worldwide. Participants with normotensive, normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetes without retinopathy were recruited to the DIRECT-Prevent 1 trial and those with existing retinopathy were recruited to DIRECT-Protect 1, and were assigned to candesartan 16 mg once a day or matching placebo. After 1 month, the dose was doubled to 32 mg. Investigators and participants were unaware of the treatment allocation status. The primary endpoints were incidence and progression of retinopathy and were defined as at least a two-step and at least a three-step increase on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale, respectively. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00252733 for DIRECT-Prevent 1 and NCT00252720 for DIRECT-Protect 1.
1421 participants (aged 18-50 years) were randomly assigned to candesartan (n=711) or to placebo (n=710) in DIRECT-Prevent 1, and 1905 (aged 18-55 years) to candesartan (n=951) or to placebo (n=954) in DIRECT-Protect 1. Incidence of retinopathy was seen in 178 (25%) participants in the candesartan group versus 217 (31%) in the placebo group. Progression of retinopathy occurred in 127 (13%) participants in the candesartan group versus 124 (13%) in the placebo group. Hazard ratio (HR for candesartan vs placebo) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.67-1.00, p=0.0508) for incidence of retinopathy and 1.02 (0.80-1.31, p=0.85) for progression of retinopathy. The post-hoc outcome of at least a three-step increase for incidence yielded an HR of 0.65 (0.48-0.87, p=0.0034), which was attenuated but still significant after adjustment for baseline characteristics (0.71, 0.53-0.95, p=0.046). Final ETDRS level was more likely to have improved with candesartan treatment in both DIRECT-Prevent 1 (odds 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.30, p=0.0048) and DIRECT-Protect 1 (1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25, p=0.0264). Adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups.
Although candesartan reduces the incidence of retinopathy, we did not see a beneficial effect on retinopathy progression.
Symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation is common in supratentorial and cerebellar infarction, but is rare in brainstem infarction. It is seldom reported in basilar artery occlusion. Although early arterial recanalization by thrombolytic agent has became the new trend of treatment, for some neurologists anticoagulant is still a conventional alternative treatment of basilar artery occlusion, especially in longer-existing ischemic deficits. We report a case of massive pontine hemorrhage associated with enoxaparin (low-molecular-weight heparin) treatment for basilar artery occlusion. On the basis of the clinical information and neuroimaging, an embolism was the most likely cause of stroke. The case presented herein adds massive pontine hemorrhagic transformation to the list of possible complications of anticoagulants for basilar artery occlusion. Apart from no evidence-based benefit in treatment of basilar artery occlusion, anticoagulant may contribute to devastating hemorrhagic transformation.
In a controlled trial the effect of indomethacin was studied in 54 patients with primary dysmenorrhea. 34 patients were treated with 3 X 25 mg indomethacin per day orally for 5 days starting 2 days before onset of menstruation. Treatment was continued for 4 months, 20 patients received a placebo preparation. Symptoms of dysmenorrhea were reduced by 66-73% over the control group during all 4 treatment periods. 18 patients of the treated group reported complete relief from symptoms, 10 a marked improvement. Only 3 patients reported no effect of the drug, while in 3 other patients the treatment had to be discontinued due to the well-known untoward effects of indomethacin (nausea, vertigo). The therapeutic efficacy of indomethacin supports the concept of an essential role of prostaglandins in primary dysmenorrhea. The use of prostaglandin-synthetase inhibitors (aspirin-like drugs) is discussed for patient with primary dysmenorrhea who cannot be treated by contraceptive steroids.
Astrocytes are, as normal constituents of the brain, promising vehicles for ex vivo gene delivery to the central nervous system. In the present study, we have used a lentiviral vector encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to transduce rat-derived primary astrocytes, in order to evaluate their potential for long-term transgene expression in vivo and neuroprotection in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Following transplantation of GDNF-transduced astrocytes to the intact striatum, the level of released GDNF was 2.93 +/- 0.28 ng/mg tissue at 1 week post-grafting, reduced to 0.42 +/- 0.12 ng/mg tissue at 4 weeks, and thereafter was maintained at this level throughout the experiment (12 weeks; 0.53 +/- 0.068 ng/mg tissue). Similarly, grafting to the substantia nigra (SN) resulted in a significant overexpression of GDNF ( approximately 0.20 ng/mg tissue) at 1 week. Intact animals receiving transplants of GDNF-transduced astrocytes displayed an increased contralateral turning (5.39 +/- 1.19 turns/min) in the amphetamine-induced rotation test, which significantly correlated with the GDNF tissue levels measured in the striatum, indicating a stimulatory effect of GDNF on the dopaminergic function. Transplantation of GDNF-transduced astrocytes to the SN 1 week prior to an intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesion provided a significant protection of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. By contrast, when the cells were transplanted to the striatum, the level of released GDNF was not sufficient to rescue the striatal fibers and, hence, to protect the nigral dopaminergic neurons. Overall, our results suggest that genetically modified astrocytes expressing GDNF can provide neuroprotection in a rat model of Parkinson's disease following transplantation to the SN.
The intravesical use of local anesthetics has been described for a variety of urologic procedures with no previous reports of toxicity. We recently took care of a 2.5- year-old girl with systemic lidocaine toxicity following treatment for postoperative bladder spasms. The patient developed a generalized seizure requiring endotracheal intubation but recovered fully with supportive care. We report the clinical details of this case as well as a brief review of lidocaine toxicity.
Utility of computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of the lesions of the sinonasal tract in chronic cocaine abusers.
Eleven young cocaine abusers were included consecutively. A CT of the paranasal sinuses was made by otorhinolaryngological symptoms.
CT showed septal perforation in all of them. There was one nasal cavity and findings of sinusitis. Only a patient had naso-oral fistula.
CT is useful in septal perforation in cocaine addicts because it delineates the extension of destructive lesions.
Rieger syndrome is one of the most serious causes of tooth agenesis. Mutations in the PITX2, FOXC1, and PAX6 genes have been associated with Rieger syndrome. We have studied a three-generation Chinese family affected with Rieger syndrome and showing prominent dental abnormalities. Mutational screening and sequence analysis of the PITX2 gene revealed a previously unidentified four-base-pair deletion of nucleotides 717-720 in exon 5 in all affected members. The mutation causes a frame shift after Thr44, the 7th amino acid of the homeo-domain, and introduces a premature stop codon in the gene sequence. This deletion is the first unquestionable loss-of-function mutation, deleting all the functionally important parts of the protein. Our novel discovery indicates that the oligodontia and other phenotypes of Rieger syndrome observed in this family are due to this PITX2 mutation, and these data further support the critical role of PIXT2 in tooth morphogenesis.
To evaluate the ocular changes and medical and surgical therapy after high-dose systemic steroid treatment in babies with infantile spasm and hypsarrhythmia.
Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.
In 5 of the 9 (55%) babies with infantile spasm exposed to systemic corticosteroid treatment, an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic disc cupping was observed.
Ophthalmic examination under mild sedation was conducted 3 to 4 weeks after initiation of systemic therapy. Antiglaucoma treatment was given to the patients found to have high IOPs and cup-to-disc ratio changes. Routine follow-up was continued until systemic therapy was completed.
Controlled IOP with a decrease in cupping damage after antiglaucoma therapy.
Five patients required antiglaucoma treatment; one also underwent augmented trabeculectomy. Mean IOP decreased in this subgroup from 30.1 +/- 9.5 mmHg to 15.4 +/- 4.2 mmHg in the right eye (P = 0.043) and from 32.6 +/- 7.4 mmHg to 15.2 +/- 1.8 mmHg in the left eye (P = 0.043). Mean cup-to-disc ratio improved from 0.53 +/- 0.2 to 0.37 +/- 0.04 in the right eye (P = 0.06) and from 0.57 +/- 0.12 to 0.35 +/- 0.05 in the left eye (P = 0.042).
The rapid onset of IOP and cup-to-disc ratio changes in patients with infantile spasm and hypsarrhythmia treated by high-dose corticosteroids necessitates early and intensive monitoring to prevent anatomic ocular damage and visual impairment in the future.
The incidences of pentamidine-associated nephrotoxicity and hyperkalemia were determined from a retrospective review of records in AIDS patients using standard definitions for both toxicities. There were 37 patients, mean age 35.6 +/- 7.7 years and mean initial creatinine clearance (Clcr) 96 mL/min (1.6 mL/s). The mean pentamidine dose was 255 +/- 60 mg/d (3.87 +/- 0.33 mg/kg/d). The mean total dose was 2900 +/- 1600 mg given over 11.6 +/- 5.9 days (range 3-21 d). In 28 patients who were nephrotoxic (8 mild, 6 moderate, 14 severe), 27 episodes were possibly or probably pentamidine-associated. Total dose and days to nephrotoxicity onset were 1570 +/- 710 mg and 6.4 +/- 2.8 days (range 2-15 d), respectively. Nine patients became hyperkalemic (one required countermeasures) and all cases were pentamidine-associated. Total dose and days to hyperkalemia onset were 2510 +/- 1460 mg and 9.2 +/- 4.9 days (range 3-16 d), respectively. Mean baseline potassium increased and Clcr decreased significantly during therapy (from 4.2 to 4.9 mEq/L and from 96 to 70 mL/min, respectively). No correlation between nephrotoxicity or hyperkalemia and initial renal function was found, but significant correlations were found between the total pentamidine dose or duration and the percent of renal function remaining. AIDS patients have a high incidence of pentamidine-associated nephrotoxicity (up to 73 percent) and hyperkalemia (24 percent) with a trend to earlier onset of the former.
Abnormalities of the short arm of chromosome 4 cause multiple congenital malformations, including craniofacial, oral, and dental manifestations. A candidate gene for oral defects in this region is MSX1, which is mandatory for normal oral and tooth development. We examined the dentition and the presence of MSX1 in eight Finnish patients with abnormalities of 4p, including seven cases of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Five of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome patients presented with agenesis of several teeth, suggesting that oligodontia may be a common (even though previously not well-documented) feature in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. In fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, the five patients with oligodontia lacked one copy of MSX1, while the other three had two hybridization signals. One of these presented with the only case of cleft palate among the patients. Our result confirms that haploinsufficiency for MSX1 serves as a mechanism that causes selective tooth agenesis but, alone, is not enough to cause oral clefts.
On the basis of clinical and audiological examinations of 102 tuberculosis patients who were on a combined treatment which included aminoglycoside antibiotics (streptomycin and canamycin), neurosensory disorders of the hearing function were detected in 75% of them. A clinical trial of obsidan, a beta-blocking agent, was performed in which it was used as a protective drug against ototoxic antibiotics given to 112 patients. Its combined application with antibiotics of the aminoglycoside series decreased their toxic effect from 75.6% to 21.4%.
Tocopherols are present in significant amounts in vegetable oils used in human foods. The most prevalent tocopherols in foods are the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants with (RRR) stereochemistry. Tocopherols are lipophilic phenolic antioxidants, produced by plants. In the United States, gamma-tocopherol is the most prominent dietary tocopherol due to its high amount in the dominant commercially produced vegetable oils such as soybean, corn, and cottonseed. In this report, experiments were designed to study the inhibitory effect of mixed tocopherols against N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary tumor growth in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Beginning at 21 days of age, rats were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg body weight of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. One wk later, the rats were fed experimental diets containing 0 or 0.1% mixed tocopherols containing over 50% gamma-tocopherol. At 9 wk after N-methyl-N-nitrosourea treatment, all rats were evaluated for inhibition of mammary tumor growth and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Dietary administration of mixed tocopherols significantly suppressed mammary tumor growth (P < 0.05) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (P < 0.01) and also moderately suppressed tumor multiplicity. The treatment increased the serum levels of gamma- and delta-tocopherols without affecting the body weight. The results of this study suggest that mixed tocopherols may be safe and effective agents for the prevention of breast cancer.
