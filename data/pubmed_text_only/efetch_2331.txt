The effects of PG-9 (3alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate), the acetylcholine releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis were evaluated. In the mouse passive-avoidance test, PG-9 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1-selective antagonist S-(-)-ET-126. In the same experimental conditions, PG-9 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced amnesia, demonstrating a central localization of the activity. At the highest effective doses, PG-9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test. PG-9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG-9 were 17.6-fold of the control value. During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG-9. The current work indicates the ability of PG-9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells. Therefore, PG-9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of human type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Although SIRT1 has a therapeutic effect on metabolic deterioration in T2DM, the precise mechanisms by which SIRT1 improves insulin resistance remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SIRT1 in the liver of diet-induced insulin-resistant low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice and of genetically obese ob/ob mice attenuates hepatic steatosis and ameliorates systemic insulin resistance. These beneficial effects were associated with decreased mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, inhibited the unfolded protein response (UPR), and enhanced insulin receptor signaling in the liver, leading to decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and improved glucose tolerance. The tunicamycin-induced splicing of X-box binding protein-1 and expression of GRP78 and CHOP were reduced by resveratrol in cultured cells in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Conversely, SIRT1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts challenged with tunicamycin exhibited markedly increased mTORC1 activity and impaired ER homeostasi and insulin signaling. These effects were abolished by mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin in human HepG2 cells. These studies indicate that SIRT1 serves as a negative regulator of UPR signaling in T2DM and that SIRT1 attenuates hepatic steatosis, ameliorates insulin resistance, and restores glucose homeostasis, largely through the inhibition of mTORC1 and ER stress.
A case of fatal aplastic anemia due to carbamazepine treatment in an epileptic woman is reported. Despite concerns of fatal bone marrow toxicity due to carbamazepine, this is only the fourth documented and published report. Carbamazepine is a safe drug, but physicians and patients should be aware of the exceedingly rare but potentially fatal side effects, better prevented by clinical than by laboratory monitoring.
Ten preterm infants (birth weight 0.970 to 2.495 kg) with apnea due to periodic breathing (apneic interval = 5 to 10 seconds) or with "serious apnea" (greater than or equal to 20 seconds) were studied before and after the administration of theophylline. We determined the incidence of apnea, respiratory minute volume, alveolar gases, arterial gases and pH, "specific" compliance, functional residual capacity, and work of breathing. Theophylline decreased the incidence of apnea (P less than .05), increased respiratory minute volume (P less than 0.001), decreased (PACO2 (and PaCO2 P less than 0.001), increased the slope of the CO2 response curve (P less than 0.02) with a significant shift to the left (P less than 0.02). These findings suggest that the decreased incidence of apnea after theophylline is associated with an increase in alveolar ventilation and increased sensitivity to CO2 with a pronounced shift of the CO2 response curve to the left. These data are consistent with the idea that apnea is a reflection of a depressed respiratory system.
Prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy in the United States as well as in many European countries. It is curable as long as it is localized, but the invasion of prostate cancer and formation of metastasis turn it into a life-threatening disease. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is believed to play a key role in tissue degradation and cell migration under various normal and pathological conditions, including cancer invasion and metastasis. Increased expression of uPA has been reported in various malignancies including prostate cancer. However, the mechanisms of the overexpression have remained poorly understood. Here, we report increased copy number of uPA gene in 3 of 13 hormone-refractory prostate carcinomas, including 1 high-level amplification. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that the increased expression of uPA coincided with the amplification of the gene in these tumors. Matrigel invasion assay showed that prostate cancer cell line PC-3, containing amplification of the uPA gene, was more sensitive to the urokinase inhibitor, amiloride, than DU145 or LNCaP cell lines, which do not have the amplification. The findings suggest that one of the mechanisms underlying the overexpression of the uPA is the amplification of the gene, which is associated with the increased invasive potential of the cells.
The objective of this study is to conduct a dose-finding study of sarizotan in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with dyskinesia to identify a safe dose and to identify a sensitive dyskinesia rating measure. Sarizotan is a novel compound with full 5-HT(1A) agonist properties and additional high affinity for D(3) and D(4) receptors. An open label study documented improvements in PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia. There is no precedent for study designs or outcome measures in pivotal trials of antidyskinesia therapies. The approach used here was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study. Included were PD patients optimized to levodopa and dopaminergic drugs with moderately disabling dyskinesias present greater than or equal to 25% of the waking day. Interventions included sarizotan 2, 4, or 10 mg/day or matching placebo, given in two doses. There were two outcome measures: the primary measure was change from baseline in diary-based on time without dyskinesia; the secondary measures were change from baseline in scores on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), the composite score of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Items 32+33 (dyskinesia duration and disability) and total UPDRS. A total of 398 subjects were randomized, with 381 included in the intention-to-treat population. No significant changes occurred on sarizotan compared to placebo on any diary-based measure of dyskinesia or the AIMS score. The composite score of UPDRS Items 32+33 was significantly improved with 2 mg/day sarizotan, with a trend at 10 mg/day. Adverse events were not significantly different in sarizotan- and placebo-treated patients, but off time significantly increased with sarizotan 10 mg/day. Sarizotan 2 mg/day is a safe agent in PD patients with dyskinesia. To test its role in abating dyskinesia, future studies should focus on this dose and will use the composite score of UPDRS Items 32+33 as the primary outcome.
Angiogenesis is necessary for the growth of adipose tissue. Dietary polyphenols may suppress growth of adipose tissue through their antiangiogenic activity and by modulating adipocyte metabolism. We investigated the effect of curcumin, the major polyphenol in turmeric spice, on angiogenesis, adipogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, and gene expression involved in lipid and energy metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocyte in cell culture systems and on body weight gain and adiposity in mice fed a high-fat diet (22%) supplemented with 500 mg curcumin/kg diet for 12 wk. Curcumin (5-20 micromol/L) suppressed 3T3-L1 differentiation, caused apoptosis, and inhibited adipokine-induced angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Supplementing the high-fat diet of mice with curcumin did not affect food intake but reduced body weight gain, adiposity, and microvessel density in adipose tissue, which coincided with reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR-2. Curcumin increased 5'AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, reduced glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase-1, and increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 expression, which led to increased oxidation and decreased fatty acid esterification. The in vivo effect of curcumin on the expression of these enzymes was also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In addition, curcumin significantly lowered serum cholesterol and expression of PPARgamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, 2 key transcription factors in adipogenesis and lipogenesis. The curcumin suppression of angiogenesis in adipose tissue together with its effect on lipid metabolism in adipocytes may contribute to lower body fat and body weight gain. Our findings suggest that dietary curcumin may have a potential benefit in preventing obesity.
We have previously shown that nicotine enhances cue-induced cocaine craving. In the present study, the effects of a nicotine antagonist, mecamylamine, on cue-induced cocaine craving were investigated. Twenty-three cocaine-dependent patients, all cigarette smokers, were randomly assigned to mecamylamine (2.5 mg tablet) or placebo in a single-dose, placebo-controlled, crossover, double-blind study. Craving and anxiety were measured before and after cocaine cues with visual analog scales for desire to use cocaine and mood. Skin conductance, skin temperature and heart rate were recorded before and during cocaine cues. Following exposure to cocaine cues, all patients reported an increase in cocaine craving and anxiety relative to the precue measures. Cue exposure also produced an increase in skin conductance and decrease in skin temperature. The cue-induced increase in cocaine craving was reduced, while the cue-induced skin conductance and temperature responses were unaffected, by mecamylamine. These findings show that cue-induced cocaine craving is attenuated by mecamylamine. Further study on the use of mecamylamine in relapse prevention programs are suggested.
Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans are elements of matrix. In the nervous system, glycosaminoglycans modulate neurite outgrowth and are co-receptors for growth factors playing a crucial role in cell differentiation and synaptogenesis. The receptor of protein tyrosine phosphatase beta (RPTPbeta) is a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan which plays an important role in neural morphogenesis and axon guidance mechanisms. Pilocarpine-treated rats present status epilepticus, which is followed by a seizure-free period (silent), by a period of spontaneous recurrent seizures (chronic), and the hippocampus of these animals exhibits cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting. Thus, the synthesis of heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate and the time course of RPTPbeta immunoreactivity were studied in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex during these phases of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. The results showed decreased synthesis of heparan sulphate during the acute phase and an increased synthesis of chondroitin sulphate during the silent period in the cortex and hippocampus. In control rats RPTPbeta immunoreactivity was detected only in glial cells. After 6 h of status epilepticus the RPTPbeta immunoreactivity was no longer detectable in the glial cells in both tissues and intense staining became evident in the matrix, surrounding CA3 and dentate gyrus and piriform cortex neurones. In the silent and chronic periods RPTPbeta immunoreactivity was mainly detected in neuronal somata and fibers of neurones of hippocampus and cortex. These changes show a selective variation of synthesis and expression of glycosaminoglycans and RPTPbeta in relation to epilepsy suggesting a molecular interplay between glia and neurones during seizures.
Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), brominated flame retardant, is produced in the largest amounts globally for use in plastics or building materials. TBBPA has been detected in sediment, air at the dismantling plant or human serum samples. In the present study, we examined the effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to TBBPA in mice. TBBPA (99.1% pure) in diet was administered to pregnant ICR mice at doses of 0% (control), 0.01%, 0.1% or 1.0% from gestational day 0 to weaning at postnatal day 27. The average daily food intake and body weight of dams showed no significant differences between the control and treated groups. There were no dose-related effects on reproductive data. Serum concentrations of total-cholesterol and liver weights of treated dams and offspring were higher than those of the control mice. Histological findings in treated dams or offspring showed the increase of focal necrosis of hepatocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver, and increase of dilation or atrophy of renal tubules and cyst in the kidney. TBBPA was developed as a new, safe class of flame retardant and was not highly toxic. However, the present data suggested that TBBPA caused a lipid metabolic disorder and hepatic or kidney lesion, under these conditions.
Formaldehyde (FA), an occupational and environmental toxicant used extensively in the manufacturing of many household and personal use products, is known to induce squamous cell carcinomas in the nasal turbinates of rats and mice and squamous metaplasia in monkey noses. Tissue responses to FA include a dose dependent epithelial degeneration, respiratory cell hypertrophy, and squamous metaplasia. The primary target for FA-induced toxicity in both rodents and monkeys is the respiratory nasal epithelium. FA increases nasal epithelial cell proliferation and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPX) that are associated with subsequent nasal cancer development. To address the acute effects of FA exposure that might contribute to known pathological changes, cDNA gene expression analysis was used. Two groups of male F344 rats received either 40 ul of distilled water or FA (400 mM) instilled into each nostril. Twenty-four hours following treatment, nasal epithelium was recovered from which total RNA was used to generate cDNA probes. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) hybridization data using Clontech Rat Atlas 1.2 arrays revealed that 24 of the 1185 genes queried were significantly up-regulated and 22 genes were significantly downregulated. Results for ten of the differentially expressed genes were confirmed by quantitative real time RT PCR. The identified genes with FA-induced change in expression belong to the functional gene categories xenobiotic metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair. These data suggest that multiple pathways are dysregulated by FA exposure, including those involved in DNA synthesis/repair and regulation of cell proliferation. Differential gene expression profiles may provide clues that could be used to define mechanisms involved in FA-induced nasal cancer.
Although many genes predisposing to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been identified, the biological mechanism(s) remain unclear. Mouse models based on human disease-causing mutations provide the potential for understanding gene function and novel treatment development. Here, we characterize a mouse knockout of the Cntnap2 gene, which is strongly associated with ASD and allied neurodevelopmental disorders. Cntnap2(-/-) mice show deficits in the three core ASD behavioral domains, as well as hyperactivity and epileptic seizures, as have been reported in humans with CNTNAP2 mutations. Neuropathological and physiological analyses of these mice before the onset of seizures reveal neuronal migration abnormalities, reduced number of interneurons, and abnormal neuronal network activity. In addition, treatment with the FDA-approved drug risperidone ameliorates the targeted repetitive behaviors in the mutant mice. These data demonstrate a functional role for CNTNAP2 in brain development and provide a new tool for mechanistic and therapeutic research in ASD.
The relationship between warfarin administration and the frequent development of enlarged hematomas in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is controversial. The present study was carried out to examine this issue.
This study reviewed 41 patients with nontraumatic ICH within 24 h after stroke onset from 1999 to 2003 who received long-term warfarin treatment (29 men and 12 women, 70 +/- 12 years old) and 323 patients who had not been on warfarin (177 men and 146 women, 66 +/- 13 years old). The hematoma volume (HV) on admission, final HV, frequency of hematoma enlargement (HE) and other background characteristics were investigated.
Both the HV on admission (p = 0.031) and final HV (p = 0.001) were larger in patients on warfarin than in those not receiving warfarin. HE occurred more frequently (p < 0.001), and mortality at 30 days or at discharge was higher (p = 0.003) in the warfarin group than in the control group. A multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that warfarin treatment (OR = 5.75, 95% CI = 2.41-13.8, p < 0.001), liver disease (OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.12-5.99, p = 0.026), and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.04-1.15, p < 0.001, per 1-score increase) on admission were independently related to HE.
Acute ICH in patients on long-term warfarin treatment appears to be associated with HE.
For the last 30 years fibrates have been widely prescribed to treat human dyslipidemia. However, the primary mechanism by which they lower plasma lipid levels is still unknown. Studies with transgenic mice have suggested that changes in apoC-III expression levels have a dramatic influence on plasma triglyceride levels. These results suggested that fibrates could reduce lipid levels by lowering apoC-III gene expression. In the current studies, we sought to determine whether the selected fibrates, bezafibrate, clofibrate, fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil, could reduce hepatic apoC-III mRNA and plasma apoC-III levels. Chow-fed rats were orally gavaged daily with a dosing vehicle alone or with 100 mg/kg of each of the fibrates for 1 week and in addition with gemfibrozil for 2 weeks. Bezafibrate and fenofibrate lowered plasma triglyceride by approximately half and dramatically reduced hepatic apoC-III mRNA and plasma apoC-III levels. In contrast, clofibrate did not reduce plasma triglyceride levels and only partially reduced apoC-III mRNA and plasma protein levels. Gemfibrozil strongly reduced plasma triglyceride levels and had an intermediate but significant effect on apoC-III mRNA and plasma apoC-III levels. Some of the fibrates, especially gemfibrozil also reduced plasma apoC-II levels, an effect that could contribute to the observed triglyceride-lowering effect. In addition, the ratio of plasma apoE to plasma apoC-II plus apoC-III was strongly and inversely correlated with plasma triglyceride levels. As plasma apoE levels were not reduced in gemfibrozil-treated animals, this could also have contributed to the triglyceride-lowering effect of this fibrate. Fibrate-mediated triglyceride lowering was not the result of a decreased apoB or VLDL production and, therefore, suggested an enhanced VLDL remnant catabolism. Our results suggest that the mechanism by which fibrates lower plasma triglycerides is by reducing the level of hepatic apoC-III expression.
Citrinin (CTN) is a food-contaminating mycotoxin that efficiently induces renal tumors in rats. However, the modes of carcinogenic action are still unknown, preventing assessment of the risks of CTN in humans. In the present study, the proliferative effects of CTN and its causal factors were investigated in the kidneys of gpt delta rats. In addition, three in vivo genotoxicity assays (reporter gene mutation using gpt delta rats and comet and micronucleus assays using F344 rats) were performed to clarify whether CTN was genotoxic in vivo. CTN was administrated at 20 and 40mg/kg/day, the higher dose being the maximal tolerated dose and a nearly carcinogenic dose. In the kidney cortex of gpt delta rats, significant increases in the labeling indices of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were observed at all doses of CTN. Increases in the mRNA expression levels of Ccna2, Ccnb1, Ccne1, and its transcription factor E2f1 were also detected, suggesting induction of cell cycle progression at all tested doses of CTN. However, histopathological changes were found only in rats treated with the higher dose of CTN, which was consistent with increases in the mRNA expression levels of mitogenic factors associated with tissue damage/regeneration, such as Hgf and Lcn2, at the same dose. Thus, the proliferative effects of CTN may result not only from compensatory reactions, but also from direct mitogenic action. Western blot analysis showed that ERK phosphorylation was increased at all doses, implying that cell cycle progression may be mediated by activation of the ERK pathway. On the other hand, in vivo genotoxicity analyses were negative, implying that CTN did not have the potential for inducing DNA damage, gene mutations, or chromosomal aberrations. The overall data clearly demonstrated the molecular events underlying CTN-induced cell cycle progression, which could be helpful to understand CTN-induced renal carcinogenesis.
The objective of the present study was to characterize the genitourinary syndromes that accompany indinavir-associated pyuria. Of 23 indinavir-treated patients with persistent pyuria, 4 had isolated interstitial nephritis, 10 had both interstitial nephritis and urothelial inflammation, 7 had isolated urothelial inflammation, and 2 had pyuria with nonspecific urinary tract inflammation. A total of 21 patients had multinucleated histiocytes identified by cytologic testing of urine specimens. Urine abnormalities resolved in all 20 patients who stopped receiving indinavir therapy. Pyuria continued in the 3 patients who continued receiving indinavir. Six patients had elevated serum creatinine levels, which returned to baseline levels when indinavir was discontinued. In conclusion, indinavir-associated pyuria was frequently associated with evidence of interstitial nephritis and/or urothelial inflammation, multinucleated histiocytes were commonly present in urine specimens, and cessation of indinavir therapy was associated with prompt resolution of urine abnormalities.
Endometriosis is thought to affect 5-10% of reproductive age women in the general population and is commonly treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Recent studies suggest depressive symptoms are associated with women treated with GnRH agonist for endometriosis.
A retrospective pilot study of 42 female patients, 22 in the treatment group (sertraline) and 20 in the control group (no sertraline), was conducted. All subjects had laproscopically diagnosed endometriosis and were treated with 24 weeks of GnRH agonist therapy. Assessment instruments included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Menopausal Symptom Index.
The results indicate that patients receiving concomitant sertraline reported significantly less depressive symptoms, but did not differ significantly in physical symptoms than the group receiving a GnRH agonist alone.
Antidepressants, such as sertraline, appear to be significantly helpful in the treatment of mood symptoms during the course of GnRH agonist therapy.
A total of 217 patients with essential hypertension were enrolled by 25 Canadian centers in this double-blind, parallel study to compare the efficacy and safety of enalapril administered alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. After a 4-week placebo period, patients were given 10 mg of enalapril for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks of therapy, patients were maintained on the same dose of enalapril, titrated to a higher dose of enalapril, or received combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide if their diastolic blood pressure remained > 90 mmHg. Patients in group 1 received enalapril 10 mg or 20 mg and those in group 2 received enalapril 10 mg alone or combined with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. The maintenance phase lasted 8 weeks. A standard mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure blood pressure at each visit. The mean decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was 16 mmHg in groups 1 and 2; the mean decrease in supine systolic blood pressure (SSBP) was 19 mmHg in group 1 and 20 mmHg in group 2. Eighty percent of the patients in group 1 and 81% of those in group 2 had an SDBP < or = 90 mmHg at the final visit. To achieve this control, 67% of the patients received enalapril 10 mg and 33% received enalapril 20 mg in group 1. In group 2, 70% of the patients received enalapril 10 mg and 30% received enalapril 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Eighteen patients in group 1 and 17 patients in group 2 experienced one or more minor adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, asthenia, abdominal pain, nausea, and dizziness. No major adverse events were observed. We conclude that enalapril used alone reduces blood pressure in the majority of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. When blood pressure is not controlled by enalapril alone, hydrochlorothiazide can safely be added to the regimen.
This work evaluated the potential of the isoforms of methamidophos to cause organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) in hens. In addition to inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), calpain activation, spinal cord lesions and clinical signs were assessed. The isoforms (+)-, (±)- and (-)-methamidophos were administered at 50mg/kg orally; tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) was administered (500mg/kg, po) as positive control for delayed neuropathy. The TOCP hens showed greater than 80% and approximately 20% inhibition of NTE and AChE in hen brain, respectively. Among the isoforms of methamidophos, only the (+)-methamidophos was capable of inhibiting NTE activity (approximately 60%) with statistically significant difference compared to the control group. Calpain activity in brain increased by 40% in TOCP hens compared to the control group when measured 24h after dosing and remained high (18% over control) 21 days after dosing. Hens that received (+)-methamidophos had calpain activity 12% greater than controls. The histopathological findings and clinical signs corroborated the biochemical results that indicated the potential of the (+)-methamidophos to be the isoform responsible for OPIDN induction. Protection against OPIDN was examined using a treatment of 2 doses of nimodipine (1mg/kg, i.m.) and one dose of calcium gluconate (5mg/kg, i.v.). The treatment decreased the effect of OPIDN-inducing TOCP and (+)-methamidophos on calpain activity, spinal cord lesions and clinical signs.
We reported a patient who developed acute quadriplegic myopathy (AQM) following treatment with a combination of high-dose steroid and nondepolarizing blocking agent for idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). Few cases of AQM with IIP have been reported in the literature. The HP progressed rapidly in our patient, but the high-dose steroid therapy was effective. The rehabilitative intervention comprised of passive range-of-motion exercise, functional training, and muscle strengthening. After the initial presentation with severe weakness, the AQM gradually improved and the patient regained full physical function in 8 months. The clinical course was almost identical to that of AQM patients with other lung diseases. Though unlikely to influence the improvement of muscle weakness in AQM patients, the lung diseases associated with AQM may require specific consideration in determining suitable rehabilitation programs and observing patients before and after full recovery from dysmobility.
The appetite suppressant fenfluramine, a serotonin uptake inhibitor, has been implicated in the development of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). The effect of fenfluramine on the pressor response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the canine pulmonary circulation was determined using the isolated perfused dog lung. Pulmonary vascular resistance was measured using vascular occlusion techniques. Group 1 (n=4) consisted of isolated lung lobes treated with 10(-8)M ET-1 alone. For group 2 (n=4) and group 3 (n=4), dogs were given 15 mg fenfluramine daily for 14 days prior to sacrifice for isolated lung perfusion. In group 2, lobes were treated with 10(-7)M fenfluramine after lung isolation. In group 3, the isolated lobes were treated with 10(-8)M ET-1 similar to group 1. Acute treatment of the isolated lobes in group 2 with 10(-7)M fenfluramine increased pulmonary arterial pressure. In group 3, administration of 10(-8)M ET-1 potentiated the effect of ET-1 on post-capillary resistance relative to group 1, and elicited an increase in precapillary resistance, an effect not present in group 1. These results indicate that chronic fenfluramine exposure potentiates the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to ET-1, and suggests that elevated levels of serotonin may <prime> the pulmonary circulation to become hyperreactive to other vasoactive substances possibly leading to the development of disease states such as primary pulmonary hypertension.
Long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To determine the mechanisms by which inflammation affects AD and how NSAIDs protect against it, we stimulated neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with amyloid precursor protein (APP) with proinflammatory cytokines, which increased the secretion of amyloid-beta and APP ectodomain. Addition of ibuprofen, indomethacin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonists, or cotransfection with PPARgamma cDNA reversed this effect. The inhibitory action of ibuprofen and indomethacin was suppressed by PPARgamma antagonists. Finally, we observed that the mRNA levels, expression, and enzymatic activity of beta-secretase were increased by immunostimulation and normalized by NSAIDs. In conclusion, proinflammatory cytokines activate beta-secretase, and NSAIDs inhibit this effect through PPARgamma.
Repeated (+)-amphetamine sulfate (AMPH) administration (5 mg/kg sc twice daily for 6 days and once on day 7) markedly and reversibly decreased (until 96 h after the final dose) neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) in the rat striatum (caudate-putamen) and nucleus accumbens, and had no effect on NPY-LI in the hippocampus. No significant alterations were detected in the hybridization signal of NPY mRNA4 and 24 h after the end of AMPH treatment. A single dose of AMPH (5 mg/kg sc) administered to rats 4 and 24 h prior to sacrifice had no effect on NPY-LI in the brain structures studied. Moreover, AMPH injected 8 days after the last dose of repeated AMPH administration did not change NPY-LI up to 72 h. The minimal dose of haloperidol, the strong mixed dopaminergic D2/D1 receptor antagonist, (0.75 mg/kg injected ip 30 min before each of the multiple AMPH administrations) that was sufficient to completely block stereotypy and hyperlocomotion elicited by multiple AMPH administrations enhanced the AMPH-induced decrease in the striatal and accumbens NPY-LI. Our results suggest that NPY neurons in the striatum, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus are not directly involved in the acute behavioral response to AMPH (stereotypy and hyperlocomotion) as well as in the initiation and expression of AMPH-induced behavioral sensitization.
To facilitate the choice of the best visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treatment strategy for first-line health services in (VL)-endemic areas, we compared in a formal decision analysis the cost and the cost-effectiveness of the different available options.
We selected four drug regimens for VL on the basis of frequency of use, feasibility and reported efficacy studies. The point estimates and the range of plausible values of effectiveness and cost were retrieved from a literature review. A decision tree was constructed and the strategy minimizing the cost per death averted was selected.
Treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate was the most effective approach in the baseline analysis and averted 87.2% of all deaths attributable to VL. The least expensive and the most cost-effective treatment was the miltefosine regimen, and the most expensive and the least cost-effective was AmBisome treatment. The cost of drug and medical care are the main determinants of the cost-effectiveness ranking of the alternative schemes. Sensitivity analysis showed that antimonial was competitive with miltefosine in the low-resistance regions.
In areas with >94% response rates to antimonials, generic sodium stibogluconate remains the most cost-effective option for VL treatment, mainly due to low drug cost. In other regions, miltefosine is the most cost-effective option of treatment, but its use as a first-line drug is limited by its teratogenicity and rapid resistance development. AmBisome in mono- or combination therapy is too expensive to compete in cost-effectiveness with the other regimens.
To refine the criteria for the diagnosis of amiodarone-related optic neuropathy by including a broader spectrum of clinical features, thus helping to differentiate this entity from nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy coincidentally affecting a patient taking amiodarone.
A retrospective case review of 22 patients who developed optic neuropathy while taking amiodarone, in whom other systemic causes were excluded.
We identified 3 groups of patients: those in whom a diagnosis of amiodarone-induced optic neuropathy seems probable (n = 14), those in whom an association with amiodarone optic neuropathy is indeterminate (n = 5), and those in whom the occurrence of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy seems to be coincidental (ie, unrelated to amiodarone) (n = 3). We formulated specific diagnostic criteria for each of these categories.
We recommend a systematic approach that includes assessment of bilaterality, mode of onset, degree of optic nerve dysfunction, structure of the uninvolved optic disc in unilateral cases, and systemic toxic effects. Such well-defined diagnostic criteria can help the clinician in the treatment of patients with this disorder.
