A major challenge in cancer genetics is to determine which low-frequency somatic mutations are drivers of tumorigenesis. Here we interrogate the genomes of 7,651 diverse human cancers and find inactivating mutations in the homeodomain transcription factor gene CUX1 (cut-like homeobox 1) in ~1-5% of various tumors. Meta-analysis of CUX1 mutational status in 2,519 cases of myeloid malignancies reveals disruptive mutations associated with poor survival, highlighting the clinical significance of CUX1 loss. In parallel, we validate CUX1 as a bona fide tumor suppressor using mouse transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis and Drosophila cancer models. We demonstrate that CUX1 deficiency activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling through direct transcriptional downregulation of the PI3K inhibitor PIK3IP1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase interacting protein 1), leading to increased tumor growth and susceptibility to PI3K-AKT inhibition. Thus, our complementary approaches identify CUX1 as a pan-driver of tumorigenesis and uncover a potential strategy for treating CUX1-mutant tumors.
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are potential teratogenic agents. The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term effects of intrauterine AED exposure on neurologic and psychological functioning.
Of a prospective study, "Epilepsy, pregnancy, and child development," children could be retraced at school age and adolescence. Sixty-seven were born to mothers with epilepsy [no drugs during pregnancy (n = 13), monotherapy (n = 31), polytherapy (n = 23)]; 49 were nonafflicted control children. Assessments included an intelligence test (Wechsler), a neurologic examination (Touwen), and an EEG. Data analyses were performed, controlling for parental social status, type of maternal drug therapy and drug dosage, type of epilepsy, frequency of seizures during pregnancy, the original subgroups, and specific drug effects.
Type of maternal epilepsy and type and kind of AED therapy, but not maternal seizures during pregnancy correlated with an increase in abnormal EEG patterns. Minor neurologic dysfunction was diagnosed, with increased frequency from the control to the risk/no drug or monotherapy to the polytherapy group. The compromised intelligence score of the polytherapy group was primarily due to those children who had been exposed to primidone (PRM). Level of IQ was negatively associated with PRM dosage.
Maternal epilepsy and AED therapy during pregnancy appear to have long-term effects on the offspring well into adolescence, as evinced in EEG patterns, minor neurologic dysfunction, and intellectual performance. Severity of effects increased from control group to epilepsy/no-drug group to monotherapy group and was most marked in the polytherapy group. These group differences are assumed to reflect differential neural vulnerability to social and family factors.
Acute renal failure (ARF) was observed in 6 patients under indomethacin treatment. Before receiving the drug 3 patients had normal, and the other 3 slightly elevated plasma creatinine levels. All patients were also treated with diuretics. ARF developed within the first 48 hours of therapy. Four patients had clear-cut oliguria. The renal disorders proved completely and rapidly reversible after treatment was discontinued, except in one female patient who had to undergo peritoneal dialysis for 12 days and in whom moderate aggravation of the pre-existing renal insufficiency persisted on follow up. The ARF was attributed to a sudden fall in renal blood flow due to the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on prostaglandin synthetase. This complication occurs exclusively in patients with renal hypoperfusion secondary to hypovolaemia, with cardiac insufficiency or with intrarenal vascular lesions. Sodium depletion induced by previous or concomitant diuretic treatment increases the risks. The possibility of ARF warrants careful monitoring of urinary output and renal function at the onset of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with altered or precarious haemodynamics.
Doxorubicin is one of the most effective antineoplastic drugs in clinical practice. Its clinical usefulness extends from acute leucemia and lymphoma to a wide range of solid tumors. However, the use of this drug is limited by its cardiac toxicity, that is often life-threatening. A number of clinical approaches discussed in this paper have been used to circumvent the problem of doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure. A summarizing survey of the literature has led to establish two principles for prevention of doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure with clinical meaning in the moment: --the way of administration --the clinical use of Ca-antagonist. The two principles provide an objective basis for preventation of congestive heart failure. The pathobiochemical background, analysed in this paper in detail, demonstrates that the same metabolic condition exist in the myocardial cell as in red blood cell. These interactions are the basis for a further analysis of metabolism in the cell, especially the redox metabolism of glutathione.
The effects of fish oil supplementation on motor disorders, memory dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation (LP) induced by typical neuroleptics were studied. Wistar rats received a suspension prepared with fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids, water, and Tween 80 (1%) in the place of drinking water (FO group) or vehicle (C group) for 8 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, half of the animals of both groups were treated with haloperidol (H and FO + H groups; experiment 1), fluphenazine (F and FO + F groups; experiment 2), or vehicle (C group), administered once a week (12 mg/kg/im) for 4 weeks, maintaining the treatment with FO. Extrapyramidal motor disorders by haloperidol and fluphenazine were observed by an increase in vacuous chewing movements and catalepsy (P < 0.05). These effects were reduced by FO treatment (P < 0.05). Both neuroleptics displayed impairment in memory retention observed by latency time to find the original location of platform in water-maze task, after 4 days of training performed in the last treatment week. This effect was reduced by FO (P < 0.05) to both haloperidol and fluphenazine treatments. Haloperidol increased the LP in plasma and hippocampus, and these effects were decreased by FO treatment (P < 0.05). Fluphenazine increased the LP in plasma and substantia nigra, which were completely decreased by FO treatment (P < 0.05). The FO decreased the motor disorders, memory dysfunction, and oxidative damage typical neuroleptic-induced. Our results indicate that FO exhibits a neuroprotector role useful on diseases related to oxidative damages, and may be considered in the prevention of motor and memory side effects induced by the antipsychotic treatment.
cis-2-Pentenenitrile, an intermediate in the synthesis of nylon and other products, causes permanent behavioral deficits in rodents. Other low molecular weight nitriles cause degeneration either of the vestibular sensory hair cells or of selected neuronal populations in the brain. Adult male Long-Evans rats were exposed to cis-2-pentenenitrile (0, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, or 2.0mmol/kg, oral, in corn oil) and assessed for changes in open field activity and rating scores in a test battery for vestibular dysfunction. Surface preparations of the vestibular sensory epithelia were observed for hair cell loss using scanning electron microscopy. A separate experiment examined the impact of pre-treatment with the universal CYP inhibitor,1-aminobenzotriazole, on the effect of cis-2-pentenenitrile on vestibular rating scores. The occurrence of degenerating neurons in the central nervous system was assessed by Fluoro-Jade C staining. cis-2-Pentenenitrile had a dose-dependent effect on body weight. Rats receiving 1.50mmol/kg or more of cis-2-pentenenitrile displayed reduced rearing activity in the open field and increased rating scores on the vestibular dysfunction test battery. Hair cell loss was observed in the vestibular sensory epithelia and correlated well with the behavioral deficits. Pre-treatment with 1-aminobenzotriazole blocked the behavioral effect. Fluoro-Jade C staining did not reveal significant neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system apart from neurite labeling in the olfactory glomeruli. We conclude that cis-2-pentenenitrile causes vestibular toxicity in a similar way to allylnitrile, cis-crotononitrile and 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), and also shares other targets such as the olfactory system with these other nitriles. The present data also suggest that CYP-mediated bioactivation is involved in cis-2-pentenenitrile toxicity.
We report two patients with dyskinesia responding to antidepressants. The first is a 70-year-old man with depression, Parkinsonism and neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia who presented with hysterical mutism. After recovery from the mutism, he was started on desipramine for depression. One week later the dyskinesia improved markedly. The second patient is a 61-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, dementia, depression and L-dopa-induced oro-lingual-facial dyskinesias. He was taking levodopa, trihexyphenydil and bromocriptine. The depression was treated first with desipramine and later with trazodone. The dyskinesia improved significantly on both drugs. The response of the dyskinesias to antidepressant medication may be due to the fact that antidepressants decrease beta-adrenoreceptor sensitivity and density which in turn may result in a diminished release of dopamine since beta-adrenoceptors mediate the noradrenaline-stimulated release of dopamine.
Lithium treatment, which is extensively used in bipolar affective disorders, may give rise to hypercalcaemia and sometimes to irreversible hyperparathyroidism.
We present a patient who developed hyperparathyroidism following long-term treatment with lithium.
After 15 years on lithium the patient was diagnosed with hypercalcaemia; at the same time the patient stopped her lithium medication. Two years later she developed depression with psychotic symptoms and was given electroconvulsive treatment. Measurements of serum calcium and parathormon showed that she had developed hyperparathyroidism. Neck exploration was performed, and two parathyroid adenomas (weight 650 mg and 880 mg), which had been detected by scintigraphy, were removed. Lithium treatment was restarted. One year later she was normocalcaemic and her mood was normal.
In lithium-induced hyperparamyroidism, lithium should be replaced with other mood stabilizers, preferably an antiepilepticum. If cessation of lithium therapy does not lead to normocalcaemia, parathyroidectomy is indicated.
The effect of thymoquinone (TQ), the main constituent of the Nigella sativa L. oil, on ifosfamide (IFO)-induced Fanconi syndrome (FS) and its antitumor activity were investigated in rats and mice, respectively. In rats, a daily injection of IFO (50 mg/kg per day, i.p.) for 5 days induced a FS characterized by wasting off glucose, electrolytes and organic acids, along with elevated serum creatinine and urea, as well as decreased creatinine clearance rate. Administration of TQ with the drinking water of rats, (5 mg/kg per day) for 5 days before and during IFO treatment, ameliorated the severity of IFO-induced renal damage. TQ significantly improved IFO-induced phosphaturia, glucosuria, elevated serum creatinine and urea, and significantly normalized creatinine clearance rate. Moreover, TQ significantly prevented IFO-induced renal glutathione (GSH) depletion and lipid peroxide accumulation. In mice bearing Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) xenograft, TQ (10 mg/kg per day) administered in drinking water significantly enhanced the antitumor effect of IFO (50 mg/kg per day, i.p. on days 1-4 and 15-18). Furthermore, mice treated with IFO in combination with TQ showed less body weight loss and mortality rate compared to IFO single therapy. These observations demonstrate that TQ may improve the therapeutic efficacy of IFO by decreasing IFO-induced nephrotoxicity and improving its antitumor activity.
The objective of this study was to compare indinavir peak plasma (Cmax) values after administration of indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg on an empty stomach or with food. High indinavir Cmax values have been associated with indinavir-related nephrotoxicity.
This was an open-label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, cross-over pharmacokinetic study performed at steady state. HIV-infected patients who had been using indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily for at least 4 weeks were randomized to take this combination with a light breakfast (two filled rolls and 130 ml of fluid) on a first study day, and without food on a second day, or in the reverse order. The pharmacokinetics of indinavir and ritonavir were assessed after plasma and urine sampling during 12 h.
Data for nine patients were evaluated. Administration of indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg on an empty stomach resulted in a higher indinavir Cmax [geometric mean (GM) ratio - fasting/fed and 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28 (1.08-1.52), P=0.01] and a trend to a shorter indinavir tmax (P=0.07) compared to administration with food. The mode of administration of indinavir/ritonavir did not affect plasma indinavir Cmax and AUC values, parameters that have been associated with the antiviral efficacy of indinavir, nor the urinary excretion of indinavir.
Administration of indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg on an empty stomach results in a higher indinavir Cmax compared to ingestion with a light meal. Stated the other way round, intake with a light meal reduces indinavir Cmax, which probably reflects a food-induced delay in the absorption of indinavir. It is recommended to administer indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg with food, as a possible means to prevent indinavir-related nephrotoxicity in patients who start or continue with this regimen.
Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained twisting movements and muscle contractions and abnormal postures. Dystonia is a symptom present in many diseases of the central nervous system. Anatomical data reveal that dystonia appears in diseases involving the basal ganglia, diencephalon, brain stem and cerebellum. Physiological studies revealed an abnormal facilitation of polysynaptic reflexes at the brain stem level. A common pathogenic mechanism for dystonia must be found in order to delineate in effective treatment. From clinical and biochemical data we suggest that dystonia is produced by abnormal shift of the norepinephrine/dopamine neurotransmission in favor of norepinephrine in different brain areas.
Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, has found an important position in the practice of medicine. Its use in pregnancy, however, is an open question as a number of detrimental side effects have been reported in the fetus and neonate. Ten patients and 12 pregnancies are reported where chronic propranolol has been administered. Five patients with serial pregnancies with and without propranolol therapy are also examined. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications are examined. An attempt is made to differentiate drug-related complications from maternal disease--related complications. We conclude that previously reported hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, neonatal apnea, and bradycardia are not invariable and cannot be statistically correlated with chronic propranolol therapy. Growth retardation, however, appears to be significant in both of our series.
Major depression is characterized by dysfunction of neuroendocrine and immune networks. Trans-resveratrol, a phenolic compound presented in polygonum cuspidatum, was demonstrated previously to exert antidepressant-like effects through regulating monoaminergic system, oxidative/antioxidant defense and inflammatory response. The present study investigated the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of trans-resveratrol and piperine, a bioavailability enhancer, in mice and explored the possible mechanism. Trans-resveratrol was shown to reduce the immobility time both in the tail suspension and forced swimming tests (TST and FST). But the maximal inhibition was nearly 60% even if the doses were increased by 160 mg/kg; while piperine produced weak antidepressant-like effects in these two models. The interaction between trans-resveratrol and piperine was shown a clear-cut synergistic effect as evidenced by an isobolographic analysis. The further study suggested that the anti-immobility response from the subthreshold dose of piperine (2.5 mg/kg) and low doses of trans-resveratrol (10 and 20 mg/kg) was abolished by pretreatment with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 300 mg/kg, i.p.) in TST and FST, indicating the involvement of serotonergic system. Moreover, treatment with the subthreshold dose of piperine and low doses of trans-resveratrol attenuated reserpine-induced hypothermia and ptosis arguing for the relevance of noradrenaline. Additional evidence from neurochemical (monoamines in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus) and biochemical (monoamine oxidase, MAO activity) assays corroborated the synergistically elevated monoaminergic system after co-treatment with trans-resveratrol and piperine. The present results indicate the effect of trans-resveratrol combined with piperine on depressive-like behaviors may be partly due to the potentiated activation of monoaminergic system in the brain. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the involvement of the oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammatory and neuroprotective pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of this combination. The synergistic effect obtained from the combination may provide innovative clues for designing novel antidepressants with high efficacy and low side effects.
To study the possible relation between spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and the derangement of cognitive memory.
Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult Long-Evans rats by pilocarpine (320 mg/kg, i.p.) and interrupted after 2 h by clonazepam (CZPs mg/kg, i.p.). In addition to the animals that were given pilocarpine and CZP (group P), two groups received ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.): the first group 15 minutes after SE onset (group K15), and the second immediately after the CZP (group K120). Control groups were formed from animals not treated with pilocarpine as well as animals that received pilocarpine but did not develop motor seizures. Spatial cognitive memory was tested in the Morris water maze.
Testing was impossible for more than 6 days after SE in group P. Ketamine shortened this period for the two groups that received it. During the silent period, deteriorated cognitive memory progressively improved, but the performance of group P started to worsen before the appearance of SRS. Group K120 only expressed a tendency toward declining performance, whereas group K15 never developed SRS, and the behavior of these animals did not differ from that of the controls after the postseizure period was over. Histologically, massive hippocampal cell loss was seen in group P. Ketamine protected hippocampal cells in a time-dependent manner; group K15 did not exhibit any obvious necrosis in the hippocampus.
There is no close relation between cognitive functions and the appearance of SRS, because ketamine, administered 120 min after the beginning of SE, prevented the derangment of cognitive functions but not the appearance of SRSs.
Hearing loss after aminoglycoside administration has been thought to result primarily from hair cell injury. The purpose of the study was to determine the potential for direct injury of spiral ganglion cells and hair cells in cases of documented human aminoglycoside ototoxicity.
Retrospective case review.
The clinical course of two individuals with aminoglycoside ototoxicity are documented, including the details of administration of tobramycin and other ototoxic medication and serial audiograms. The temporal bones were processed, and the cochlear elements quantified.
Histopathological study of the temporal bones from the individuals in the study demonstrated reduction of both ganglion cell and hair cell populations. Spiral ganglion cell loss was not necessarily subadjacent to areas of hair cell loss in cases of aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Instead, spiral ganglion cell reduction may be present in segments of the cochlea with normal-appearing hair cells.
The study suggests that aminoglycoside antibiotics can injure spiral ganglion cells directly, as well as hair cells. Thus, the characteristic hearing loss of ototoxicity can result from degeneration of either cochlear element.
Gastric mucosal protection is associated with the actions of anti-ulcer drugs or agents affecting on the afferent and/or efferent nerve fibres of the vagal nerve.
1. To identify the dose-response curves of drugs (compounds) on the afferent vanilloid-receptor (capsaicin or resiniferatoxin-sensitive) and on efferent secretion (atropine, pirenzepine, cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, omeprazole, esomeprazole) basal gastric acid and stimulated gastric secretion in relation to the chemically-induced gastric mucosal damage in rats; 2. To determine the ED50 (pD2) and pA2 on the calculation of affinity and intrinsic affinity curves for these agonists/antagonists, as an indication of relative potency of effects.
The observations were carried out in rats (30 different models).
The ED50 values for affinities of capsaicin, resiniferatoxin were obtained in nmol/kg b.w. range, whereas the values were in the nmol/kg to micromol/kg b.w. ranges for effects on the gastric basal, stimulated (bethanechol, pentagastrin, histamine) gastric secretion, and the gastric mucosal damage-produced by different ulcerogenic agents (ethanol, HCl, aspirin, indomethacin).
From the observations, that agents acting on vanilloid (capsaicin) receptors were the most potent inhibitors of acid secretion and gastric lesions from necrotizing agents, suggests that the capsaicin sensitive afferent nerves have a primary place in the efferent regulated events leading to initiation of gastric mucosal damage.
Bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the proteasome that is currently under investigation for the treatment of solid malignancies. We have shown previously that bortezomib has activity in pancreatic cancer models and that the drug induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress but also suppresses the unfolded protein response (UPR). Because the UPR is an important cytoprotective mechanism, we hypothesized that bortezomib would sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Here, we show that bortezomib promotes apoptosis triggered by classic ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and thapsigargin) via a c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent mechanism. We also show that cisplatin stimulates ER stress and interacts with bortezomib to increase ER dilation, intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and cell death. Importantly, combined therapy with bortezomib plus cisplatin induced JNK activation and apoptosis in orthotopic pancreatic tumors resulting in a reduction in tumor burden. Taken together, our data establish that bortezomib sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis and show that bortezomib strongly enhances the anticancer activity of cisplatin.
Citicoline (CDP-choline) is a key intermediary in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, an important component of the neural cell membrane. It has been shown to produce beneficial effects in both animal models and non-US clinical stroke trials. This study comprised a randomized (3 doses of citicoline to 1 placebo), vehicle-controlled, double-blind trial at 21 US centers. Treatment was to be started within 24 hours of stroke onset and was continued orally for 6 weeks. Final outcome assessments were at 12 weeks. Two hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled, with approximately 65 in each of the four groups. Mean time from stroke onset to treatment was 14.5 hours, and there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the four groups except for patient weight. A significant difference between the groups, favoring citicoline treatment, was seen in terms of functional outcome as measured by the Barthel Index and Rankin scale, neurologic evaluation as measured by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scale, and cognitive function as measured by the Mini Mental Status Examination. When the baseline NIH stroke scale was used as a covariate, both the 500-mg citicoline group and the 2,000-mg citicoline group had a significant improvement in terms of the percent of patients who had a favorable outcome on the Barthel Index at 90 days. There were no drug-related serious adverse events or deaths in this study. This study suggests that oral citicoline can be used safely with minimal side effects in acute stroke treatment. Citicoline appears to improve functional outcome and reduce neurologic deficit with 500 mg of citicoline appearing to be the optimal dose.
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated the effect of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor tolcapone 100 or 200 mg three times daily on activities of daily living and motor function in 298 patients with parkinsonism receiving levodopa but without motor fluctuations. At 6 months, both dosages of tolcapone produced significant reductions in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores for activities of daily living (Subscale II) and motor function (Subscale III) and in the total score for Subscales I to III. These improvements were maintained up to the 12-month assessment. At 6 months, both tolcapone groups had changes in levodopa dosage that were significantly different from placebo: the tolcapone groups had decreases in mean total daily dose of levodopa, whereas the placebo group had a mean increase. Tolcapone was well tolerated. The principal adverse events were levodopa-related, but these were generally mild or moderate. Diarrhea was the most frequent nondopaminergic adverse event. Tolcapone appears to be beneficial in the treatment of patients with parkinsonism who have not yet developed motor fluctuations.
Recently, fluphenazine, a phenothiazine neuroleptic, has been associated with idiosyncratic retinopathy. Neuroleptic-induced retinopathy appears to be isolated to only a few structurally related phenothiazines, suggesting that the causality is not the result of dopamine antagonism. The chemical structure of fluphenazine is very similar to that of chlorpromazine and thioridazine, agents known to produce retinopathy. Like chlorpromazine and thioridazine, fluphenazine may be oxidized by retinal cytochrome P450 and/or myeloperoxidase to an electrophile, producing injury in susceptible patients.
Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) extrafine aerosol, a newly developed pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) with a hydrofluoroalkane-134a (HFA) propellant (HFA-BDP; Qvar, 3M Pharmaceuticals, St. Paul, MN), has been shown to be effective in controlling asthma symptoms at approximately half the daily dose of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-BDP.
This study evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of switching patients with asthma maintained on a stable dose of CFC-BDP pMDI to therapy with HFA-BDP pMDI at approximately half their previous daily dose of CFC-BDP.
This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group multicenter trial. Patients with at least a 6-month history of asthma whose symptoms were controlled on CFC-BDP, 400 to 1600 microg daily, during a 2-week run-in period were randomized in a 1:3 ratio to CFC-BDP at the same daily dose or HFA-BDP at approximately half the daily dose of CFC-BDP for 12 months.
A total of 473 patients were randomized: 354 to HFA-BDP, 119 to CFC-BDP. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in mean change from baseline in morning (AM) peak expiratory flow rate or forced expiratory volume in one second throughout the study. There were no consistent differences between treatment groups in individual asthma symptoms or daily beta2-agonist use during the study. There was an increase in the percentage of symptom-free days between baseline and month 12 in the HFA-BDP group (11.5%) and the CFC-BDP group (4.6%). No statistically significant differences in serum osteocalcin levels or adverse events were seen during the study or in AM plasma cortisol levels at month 12.
Asthma control was maintained in patients switched from a stable dose of CFC-BDP (400 to 1600 microg daily) to HFA-BDP at approximately half the CFC-BDP dose (200 to 800 microg daily), and was maintained over the next 12 months. HFA-BDP demonstrated a similar safety profile to CFC-BDP; there were no differences between the agents with regard to systemic effects.
The study compared sevoflurane or propofol as anaesthesia supplements to remifentanil infusion and topical local anaesthesia for insertion of a rigid bronchoscope for bronchial foreign body removal in children aged one to three years. Seventy children were randomly allocated to two groups to receive remifentanil infusion at 0.2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) with either sevoflurane or propofol supplements for insertion of the rigid bronchoscope. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure before anaesthesia, prior to and on insertion of the bronchoscope and one, three, five, seven and ten minutes after insertion were measured. Incidence of cough and apnoea were recorded. The haemodynamic changes during bronchoscopy were moderate and did not differ between groups. The sevoflurane group had a lower incidence of cough than the propofol group. No significant difference was detected in the incidence of apnoea between groups. It can be concluded that remifentanil infusion with modest use of general anaesthetic agents facilitates rigid bronchoscopy successfully in children.
One hundred and ninety-seven patients exhibiting a disturbed sleep pattern were recruited by thirty-five general practitioners into this single-blind randomized parallel group multicentre study. There were twelve patient withdrawals or drop-outs leaving sixty-one, sixty-three and sixty-one patients who, following 2 nights on placebo as baseline, completed 5 consecutive nights of treatment on loprazolam (1 mg), temazepam (20 mg) and placebo, respectively. Loprazolam and temazepam were found to have similar hypnotic activity with both treatments being superior to placebo. There was no statistical difference in the side-effect profile of the three treatment groups.
An initial clinical phase I trial of isophosphamide has been carried out at dose levels of 200-10,000 mg/m2 of body surface area using a single-dose, every-3-week schedule. Significant toxicity was not seen at isophosphamide dose levels less than 2900 mg/m2. At higher doses, nausea and vomiting was nearly universal. Hematologic toxicity manifested by leukopenia occurred in 12 of 20 patients treated with doses of 3800-7000 mg/m2. Thrombocytopenia to 100,000 platelets/mm3 was not seen in any patient. Urinary bladder toxicity manifested by hemorrhagic cystitis was seen in 15 of 23 patients treated with doses of 3800-10,000 mg/m2. Hemorrhagic cystitis could be completely prevented by bladder irrigation with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (1% solution, 2000 ml/day). With careful attention to hydration, renal toxicity was largely prevented with blood urea nitrogen elevations to 30 mg/dl in only two of 14 patients receiving isophosphamide doses of 5000-7000 mg/m2. Another side effect was central nervous system toxicity in seven of 17 patients at doses of 5000-10,000 mg/m2. For phase II trials a dose of 5000 mg/m2 is recommended, with careful attention to the state of hydration in the patient and with the knowledge that bladder irrigation may be necessary for the prevention and/or amelioration of bladder toxicity.
