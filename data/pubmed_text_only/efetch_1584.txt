The aims of our randomized, single-blind trial involving 49 patients were to study the efficacy, side effects, and tolerance of metronidazole and satranidazole in patients of amebic liver abscess. Twenty-five patients received metronidazole (800 mg TID) and 24 received satranidazole (300 mg TID with placebo at mealtime). Patients recorded side effects and tolerability through a performa. The time taken for resolution of fever and pain and the fall in abscess size was not significant. However, tolerance of satranidazole as reported by the patients was significantly better than metronidazole (P < .005). The incidence of adverse effects was significantly lower in the group given satranidazole (P < .005). The incidence of nausea and metallic taste was significantly lower in the patients given satranidazole (P < .005). Thus, despite having a similar efficacy, satranidazole showed a far lower incidence of side effects and had a significantly better tolerance than Metronidazole.
Dopamine agonists are effective in delaying levodopa-induced dyskinesia in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and reducing motor fluctuations in advanced PD. Rotigotine, a novel dopamine receptor agonist, improves motor function in both early and advanced PD using a transdermal route of administration. A smaller, but convincing body of data, supports its ability to ameliorate the symptoms of restless legs syndrome as well. The side-effect profile mimics other dopamine agonists, with the addition of application-site reactions, most of which are mild-to-moderate. Advantages over existing dopamine agonists include once-daily administration, absence of food interactions, maintenance of stable plasma levels and utility in patients with swallowing difficulties.
1. We have investigated the mechanism of capsaicin-induced mouse ear oedema compared with that of arachidonic acid (AA)-induced ear oedema, and evaluated the possible involvement of neuropeptides in the development of capsaicin-induced oedema. 2. Topical application of capsaicin (0.1-1.0 mg per ear) to the ear of mice produced immediate vasodilatation and erythema followed by the development of oedema which was maximal at 30 min after the treatment. This oedema was of shorter duration with less swelling than AA-induced oedema (2.0 mg per ear). 3. Capsaicin-induced ear oedema was unaffected when inhibitors of arachidonate metabolites including platelet activating factor (PAF) were administered before capsaicin (250 micrograms per ear) application, while these agents significantly prevented AA-induced oedema. Dexamethasone, histamine H1 and/or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonists, and substance P (SP) antagonists were effective in inhibiting both models. Furthermore, a Ca(2+)-channel blocker and the capsaicin inhibitor, ruthenium red, were effective inhibitors of capsaicin oedema but had no effect on AA-induced oedema. 4. Phosphoramidon (50 micrograms kg-1, i.v.), an endopeptidase inhibitor, markedly (P < 0.001) enhanced only capsaicin-induced ear oedema, but bestatin (0.5 mg kg-1, i.v.), an aminopeptidase, failed to enhance oedema formation. 5. Neuropeptides (1-100 pmol per site) such as rat calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), SP, neurokinin A (NKA), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which are released from capsaicin-sensitive neurones, caused ear oedema by intradermal injection. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of CGRP (10 fmol per site) and SP (10 pmol per site) on oedema formation was observed. 6. The oedema induced by neuropeptides was significantly (P<0.05 or P<0.001) inhibited when cyproheptadine (20 mg kg-1, p.o.), a histamine H, and 5-HT antagonist, was administered before injection. In contrast, nifedipine (50 mg kg-1, p.o.), a Ca2+-channel blocker, and indomethacin(10 mg kg-1, p.o., except for NKA), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, had little effect on neuropeptide induced oedema.7. These results suggest that the mechanism of capsaicin-induced ear oedema is different from that of AA-induced oedema and suggest that the development of capsaicin-induced ear oedema is primarily mediated by neuropeptides. The neuropeptides released after activation of sensory nerves cause an increase of vascular permeability by interactions with endothelial cells and by histamine (and 5-HT)release from mast cells.
Cannabis use may precipitate schizophrenia especially if the individual has a genetic vulnerability to this mental disorder. Human and animal research indicates that neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether dysfunction in the Nrg1 gene modulates the behavioural effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychotropic component of cannabis.
Heterozygous Nrg1 transmembrane-domain knockout mice (Nrg1 HET) were treated with acute THC (0, 5 or 10 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before being tested using open field (OF), hole board (HB), light-dark (LD), elevated plus maze (EPM), social interaction (SI) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests.
Nrg1 HET mice showed differences in baseline behaviour with regard to locomotor activity, exploration and anxiety. More importantly, they were more sensitive to the locomotor suppressant actions of THC compared to wild type-like (WT) mice. In addition, Nrg1 HET mice expressed a greater THC-induced enhancement in % PPI than WT mice. The effects of THC on anxiety-related behaviour were task-dependent, with Nrg1 HET mice being more susceptible than WT mice to the anxiogenic effects of THC in LD, but not in the EPM, SI and OF tests.
Nrg1 HET mice were more sensitive to the acute effects of THC in an array of different behaviours including those that model symptoms of schizophrenia. It appears that variation in the schizophrenia-related neuregulin 1 gene alters the sensitivity to the behavioural effects of cannabinoids.
Intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging is reported to be a safe test with minimal side effects. It has been proposed by some that the test simply dilates the coronary vessels without actually producing myocardial ischemia. In this report, we describe a patient who, following intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging, developed severe myocardial ischemia which persisted for 90 minutes, requiring emergency coronary angioplasty to alleviate the ischemic insult. Sequential electrocardiograms and cardiac isoenzyme levels following coronary angioplasty were within normal limits. Thus, severe myocardial ischemia following intravenous dipyridamole testing can occur and emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring of these patients, particularly when the pretest risk of coronary disease is high.
A 65 year old man with recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias post myocardial infarction developed dysarthria and visual hallucinations due to flecainide toxicity. A readily available assay is required for estimating serum flecainide levels in patients with diminished renal or hepatic function or failed arrhythmia suppression.
Hepatic ganglioside composition was investigated in normal and cholestatic Wistar rats. Cholestasis was induced by 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE; 5 mg/kg body weight s.c. for 18 days). As compared with controls, the EE administration resulted in severe cholestasis, as indicated by biochemical as well as morphological signs. Gangliosides isolated from the liver tissue were separated by TLC, with resorcinol-HCl detection and densitometric evaluation. As compared with controls, the total hepatic lipid sialic acid content in cholestatic rats was increased almost 2-fold (44.3 +/- 15.2 vs 79.1 +/- 9.0 nmol/g wet weight of liver tissue, p < 0.01). This increase was primarily due to the increase of ganglioside GD1a (3.6 +/- 1.0 vs 11.8 +/- 3.0 nmol/g wet weight of liver tissue, p = 0.001), as well as to the enormous up-regulation of b-series gangliosides GD3 (0.08 +/- 0.03 vs 2.0 +/- 1.2 nmol/g wet weight of liver tissue, p = 0.002), GD1b (0.1 +/- 0.06 vs 5.4 +/- 1.6 nmol/g wet weight of liver tissue, p = 0.002) and GT1b (0.06 +/- 0.03 vs 6.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/g wet weight of liver tissue, p = 0.002). As the majority of gangliosides are concentrated in cell membranes, our findings suggest that dramatic increase of b-series gangliosides might contribute to the protection of hepatocytes against the deleterious effects of cholestasis.
The pollutant, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ("dioxin"), has been implicated in the etiology of a wide variety of human birth defects. In an effort to identify pharmacological blockers of dioxin-induced terata, we performed a histological and microscopic analysis of the developing murine palate that had been exposed to dioxin. In both in vivo and in vitro model systems, we observed that dioxin exposure leads to a reduction in the number of filopodial extensions at the medial epithelial edge of the developing palate. Given that this filopodial aberration is similar to the phenotype observed in Tgfbeta3 null mice, a mutant known to display a 100% incidence of cleft palate, we examined the interaction between TGFbeta3 and dioxin in palatal fusion. We found that that the addition of TGFbeta3 to an in vitro palate culture model prevented the dioxin-induced reduction in filopodial density. Moreover, TGFbeta3 exposure completely prevented the dioxin-induced block of palatal fusion in this system. Although these data do not point to a direct cellular or molecular mechanism for TGFbeta3 dioxin antagonism, these results do suggest that TGFbeta3 or stimulators of this signaling pathway hold potential as antidotes for dioxin-induced terata and that this opposing pharmacology may extend to additional toxicological endpoints.
Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a neuropeptide involved in integrating the behavioral, autonomic, and hormonal responses to stress within the central nervous system. Patients suffering from depression have abnormal activity in stress responsive brain regions and elevated cerebrospinal fluid CRF. The DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder include behavioral changes such as depressed mood, anhedonia, and psychomotor agitation/retardation. We studied the effects of 434 microgram of CRF given intracerebroventricularly over 40 min in group and individually housed monkeys to examine the role of elevated levels of central CRF on behavior. CRF elicited a wide range of behaviors, which fell into three broad categories: anxiety-like, depressive-like, and externally oriented. Externally oriented behaviors decreased, and anxiety-like behaviors increased regardless of how the animals were housed. Interestingly, increased depressive-like behaviors were only observed when the animals were socially housed. In a separate experiment, we examined the effects of the same dose of CRF on the regional cerebral glucose metabolism of lightly anesthetized monkeys by using positron emission tomography and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose. CRF infusion increased glucose metabolism in the pituitary/infundibulum, the amygdala, and hippocampus. These results indicate that increased central CRF tone affects primate behavior in a context-dependent manner, and that it activates limbic and stress-responsive regions. The fact that intracerebroventricular CRF increases depressive-like behavior in socially housed animals and increases activity in limbic brain regions may help explain the behavioral and metabolic alterations in humans with affective disorders, and this model could therefore have significant value in the development of novel antidepressant treatments.
Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a chronic disease for which there is currently no approved medical treatment. We previously reported in an animal model that β-blockade with metoprolol exerted beneficial effects on left ventricular remodeling and survival. Despite the recent publication of promising human data, β-blockade in chronic AR remains controversial. More data are needed to support this potentially new treatment strategy. We hypothesized that carvedilol might be another safe treatment option in chronic AR, considering its combined β-blocking and α-blocking effects and proven efficacy in patients with established heart failure.
The effects of a 6-month treatment with carvedilol 30 mg/kg/d orally were evaluated in adult Wistar rats with severe AR. Sham-operated and untreated AR animals were used as controls. Carvedilol treatment resulted in less left ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation. Ejection fraction was improved and filling pressures were reduced by carvedilol. β1-Receptor expression was also improved as well as myocardial capillary density. Those beneficial effects were noted despite the presence of drug-induced bradycardia.
Carvedilol exerted protective effects against volume-overload cardiomyopathy in this model of aortic valve regurgitation with preserved ejection fraction. These results suggest a protective class effect of β-blockers. Combined with the recent publication of promising human data, our findings support the need to carefully design a prospective study in humans to evaluate the effects of β-blockers in chronic aortic valve regurgitation.
There has been little exploration of major biologic regulators of cerebral development in autism. In archived neonatal blood of children with autistic spectrum disorders (n = 69), mental retardation without autism (n = 60), or cerebral palsy (CP, n = 63) and of control children (n = 54), we used recycling immunoaffinity chromatography to measure the neuropeptides substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT3), and neurotrophin 4/5 (NT4/5). Neonatal concentrations of VIP, CGRP, BDNF, and NT4/5 were higher (ANOVA, all p values < 0.0001 by Scheffe test for pairwise differences) in children in the autistic spectrum and in those with mental retardation without autism than in control children. In 99% of children with autism and 97% with mental retardation, levels of at least one of these substances exceeded those of all control children. Concentrations were similar in subgroups of the autistic spectrum (core syndrome with or without mental retardation, other autistic spectrum disorders with or without mental retardation) and in the presence or absence of a history of regression. Among children with mental retardation, concentrations did not differ by severity or known cause (n = 11, including 4 with Down syndrome). Concentrations of measured substances were similar in children with CP as compared with control subjects. SP, PACAP, NGF, and NT3 were not different by diagnostic group. No measured analyte distinguished children with autism from children with mental retardation alone. In autism and in a heterogeneous group of disorders of cognitive function, overexpression of certain neuropeptides and neurotrophins was observed in peripheral blood drawn in the first days of life.
Ellipticine, an alkaloid isolated from Apocyanaceae plants, has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in several human malignant tissues including breast, thyroid, and ovarian cancers. The antitumor activity of ellipticine is thought to be primarily mediated by the induction of DNA damage through the inhibition of topoisomerase II and formation of DNA adducts. The human endometrium is known to express topoisomerase II. However, the apoptogenic activity of ellipticine and the mechanisms underlying its action have not been investigated in endometrial cancer cells. In the present study, exposure to ellipticine (1-10μM) was shown to induce apoptosis in RL95-2 human endometrial cancer cells. Ellipticine-induced cell death was associated with the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and was accompanied by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial membrane, and caspase activation. The production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased and sustained at high levels during ellipticine treatment. Subsequent to ROS accumulation, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated in ellipticine-treated cells. Release of AIF from the mitochondria appeared to be affected by caspases, ROS, and ERK. The present data show that the treatment of RL95-2 cells with ellipticine induces apoptosis, ellipticine-induced apoptosis is mediated by ROS and the activation of MAPKs, and release of AIF is involved in a caspase-independent pathway. These results demonstrate the potential of ellipticine as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human endometrial cancers.
Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms (TNSs) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine. However, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal. Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine. Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs.
Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% lidocaine in 7.5% glucose, 2% prilocaine in 7.5% glucose, or 0.5% bupivacaine in 7.5% glucose. All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy. Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted. In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure.
Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs. Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine (150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after bupivacaine (200 and 299 min, respectively; P < 0.05).
Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs.
Indomethacin increases plasma lithium levels. A patient taking lithium for manic-depressive illness became delirious after indomethacin was initiated for arthritis. The probable mechanism of this interaction is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin, resulting in renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal excretion of lithium. When indomethacin is administered in addition to lithium, there is a risk of potentially fatal lithium toxicity.
Activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) has been shown to play a role in neuronal regeneration and development of posttraumatic neuropathic pain. The ROCK inhibitor Fasudil, used clinically for the treatment of vasospasm, was used to investigate the analgesic profile of a ROCK inhibitor. Fasudil was evaluated in different preclinical models of neuropathic, osteoarthritic (OA), and inflammatory pain as well as capsaicin-induced acute pain and secondary mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, Fasudil was tested in in vivo electrophysiology to determine the mechanism by which Fasudil produces analgesia. Fasudil at the highest dose tested (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia in spinal-nerve ligation (SNL; 77%), chronic constriction injury (CCI; 53%), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical hypersensitivity (63%), sodium iodoacetate-induced OA pain (88%), and capsaicin-induced acute flinching behaviors (56%). However, Fasudil (at 30 mg/kg) failed to attenuate or had only modest effects on inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia following carrageenan injection and mechanical allodynia following Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) injection. Fasudil produced ED(50) of 10.8 mg/kg in the SNL, and 5.7 mg/kg in the OA pain models. The ED(50) and 95% CI could not be obtained in the other models. Furthermore, administration of Fasudil (10 mg/kg, iv) significantly reduced both spontaneous and evoked firing of wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in SNL, but not sham rats. Finally, Fasudil significantly decreased exploratory behaviors at 30 mg/kg. These results suggest that the acute administration of a ROCK inhibitor produces efficacy in both neuropathic and nociceptive pain states at doses devoid of locomotor side effects, with specific effects on WDR neurons.
In this article, the potential analgesic effects of Fasudil in a range of preclinical pain models were assessed. Fasudil was shown to have efficacy in neuropathic and nociceptive pain models. These findings may help identify new therapeutic treatments for pain in the clinic.
Recent evidence has suggested that cAMP plays a role as a second messenger in the decrease in nociceptive threshold (or hyperalgesia) produced by agents acting on primary afferent terminals. In support of this hypothesis we report that intradermal injection of a direct activator of adenyl cyclase, forskolin, produces a dose-dependent hyperalgesia in the rat. The duration of this hyperalgesia was prolonged by the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, isobutylmethylxanthine and rolipram. Forskolin hyperalgesia was antagonized by the Rp isomer of cyclic adenosine-3'5'-monophosphothioate, an analog of cAMP that prevents the phosphorylation of the cAMP protein kinase. The Rp isomer of cyclic adenosine-3'5'-monophosphothioate also inhibited the hyperalgesia induced by a membrane-permeable analogue of cAMP, 8-bromocyclic adenosine monophosphate, as well as the hyperalgesia induced by agents that are presumed to act directly on primary afferent nociceptors: prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin I2, (8R,15S)-dihydroxyicosa(5E-9,11,13Z)tetraenoic acid; and the adenosine A2-agonist 2-phenylaminoadenosine. Although the cAMP second messenger system contributes to primary afferent hyperalgesia, we found no evidence for a contribution of protein kinase C. Thus, hyperalgesia induced by prostaglandin E2, prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2), (8R,15S)-dihydroxyicosa(5E-9,11,13Z)tetraenoic acid, the adenosine A2-agonist 2-phenylaminoadenosine, 8-bromocyclic adenosine monophosphate and the direct activator of adenyl cyclase, forskolin, were not significantly attenuated by the selective inhibition of protein kinase C by the 19-31 fragment of protein kinase C. Two other inhibitors of protein kinase C, sphingosine and staurosporine, also failed to attenuate prostaglandin E2-induced hyperalgesia.
The participation of excitatory neurotransmitter systems in the basal ganglia in the initiation and propagation of limbic seizures induced by pilocarpine has been investigated in the rat. Limbic seizures (electrographic and motor) occur in rats receiving bilateral microinjections into the entopeduncular nucleus of 12.5 nmol N-methyl-D-aspartate or 0.1 nmol kainate, 15 min prior to a subconvulsant dose of pilocarpine (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). N-Methyl-D-aspartate (12.5 nmol) or kainate (0.5 nmol), injected alone bilaterally into the entopeduncular nucleus, induce sniffing and grooming but no electrographic or behavioural seizures. Limbic seizures also occur after a subconvulsant dose of pilocarpine when it is preceded by injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (12.5 nmol) or kainate (0.5 or 2 nmol) into the dorsal striatum. Behavioural and electrographic signs of limbic seizures following pilocarpine (380 mg/kg) are suppressed by the focal microinjection into the entopeduncular nucleus of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (0.02 nmol) or the kainate antagonist, gamma-D-glutamylamino-methylsulphonate (40 nmol). Seizure threshold within the limbic system is modulated by excitatory systems controlling basal ganglia outputs. The relative importance of N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor systems varies between different components of the basal ganglia.
Although paclitaxel is a frontline antineoplastic agent for treatment of solid tumors, the paclitaxel-evoked pain syndrome is a serious problem for patients. There is currently no valid drug to prevent or treat the paclitaxel-induced allodynia, partly due to lack of understanding regarding the cellular mechanism. Studies have shown that minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia/macrophage, prevented neuropathic pain and promoted neuronal survival in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Recently, Cata et al also reported that minocycline inhibited allodynia induced by low-dose paclitaxel (2 mg/kg) in rats, but the mechanism is still unclear.
Here, we investigate by immunohistochemistry the change of intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) in the hind paw glabrous skin, expression of macrophage and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in DRG at different time points after moderate-dose paclitaxel treatment (cumulative dose 24 mg/kg; 3 × 8 mg/kg) in rats. Moreover, we observe the effect of minocycline on the IENF, macrophages and ATF3. The results showed that moderate-dose paclitaxel induced a persisted, gradual mechanical allodynia, which was accompanied by the loss of IENF in the hind paw glabrous skin and up-regulation of macrophages and ATF3 in DRG in rats. The expressions of ATF3 mainly focus on the NF200-positive cells. More importantly, we observed that pretreatment of minocycline at dose of 30 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg, but not 5 mg/kg, prevented paclitaxel-evoked allodynia. The evidence from immunohistochemistry showed that 30 mg/kg minocycline rescued the degeneration of IENF, attenuated infiltration of macrophages and up-regulation of ATF3 induced by paclitaxel treatment in rats.
Minocycline prevents paclitaxel-evoked allodynia, likely due to its inhibition on loss of IENF, infiltration of macrophages and up-regulation of ATF3 in rats. The finding might provide potential target for preventing paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain.
46 migraineurs with secondary chronic daily headache were treated for medication abuse as outpatients by abrupt withdrawal of the offending drugs. The patients were supported with adequate explanation of the disorder, regular follow-up, amitriptyline (10 mg at night), and naproxen (500 mg) for relief of headache symptoms. By 6 months of follow-up 37 patients had relief from chronic headaches, and analgesic intake had become intermittent and appropriate to the original occasional migraine episodes. 6 had substantially reduced analgesic intake, but headache severity was unchanged; 2 had not managed to reduce intake and headache was unchanged; and 1 patient withdrew after the first visit.
The peroxisomes in the liver of four patients with alcoholic hepatitis and in six patients with drug-induced hepatitis are compared to eight control livers by catalase cytochemistry and morphometry. A decrease of catalase activity is observed in alcoholic, amitriptyline, aprindine, clomipramine and methiomazole hepatitis. Peroxisomes with a heterogeneous distribution of the catalase reaction product are found in most hepatitis livers. The number of organelles is increased 1.5 to 4.2 times in alcoholic, aprindine, methimazole and phenytoin hepatitis livers. In the last case, peroxisomes are also smaller. Changes in shape are seen in all hepatitis livers; they include invaginations, tails, funnel-like constrictions and gastruloid cisternae. In aprindine, phenytoin, methimazole and two alcoholic hepatitis livers, surface density exceeds the upper control value. These data indicate a loss of catalase activity in most hepatitis livers but also peroxisomal proliferation and shape modifications. It has been proposed that the latter changes are favorable for metabolic activity.
We describe an 84-year-old man with an unusual clinical presentation of palatal tremor in association with ciprofloxacin treatment. The patient had rhythmical movements not only of the soft palate but also of the face and trunk. Complete resolution of the symptoms occurred 2 days after discontinuation of ciprofloxacin and administration of sodium valproate. This is the first reported case of palatal tremor secondary to the use of ciprofloxacin.
Obesity was induced in neonatal mice by subcutaneous injections of monosodium glutamate (MSG) at an early neonatal stage. The process of adipocyte formation was studied comparatively in the developing epididymal adipose tissue of the MSG-treated mice and in normal mice during the period from the 6th to the 100th postnatal day. Tritiated thymidine autoradiographic studies showed that cell proliferation activity was the highest on the 6th postnatal day both in the MSG-treated and the control mice. In normal mice, however, cell proliferation took place less frequently after 6 days and had almost ceased after 49 days. In the obese mice, as evidenced by relatively high labeling indices, cell proliferation continued to occur even after 49 days. Ultimately there was no difference in the number of adipocytes counted by Hirsch's method in the MSG-treated and the control mice at the 100th postnatal day. The storage of fat droplets became more noticeable in obese mice than in normal mice after 35 days. The mean size of fat droplets of the obese mice was twice as large as that in normal mice on the 49th postnatal day. These results indicate that the MSG-induced obesity is of the hypertrophic type.
To 13 uremic patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, 4 micrograms of 1,25(OH)2D3 were given orally twice a week for 4 weeks. Intact PTH values fell from 488.3 +/- 84.2 to 235.2 +/- 59.6 pg/ml (Mean +/- SE, p less than 0.01), while serum total and ionized calcium elevated from 10.3 +/- 0.2 to 11.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dl (p less than 0.01), from 1.43 +/- 0.03 to 1.64 +/- 0.06 mmol/l (p less than 0.05), respectively, in 9 patients whose initial intact PTH level had been below 1000 pg/ml. The other 4 patients, of whom intact PTH level had been above 1000 pg/ml, did not show significant change in intact PTH values, though serum ionized calcium elevated slightly after this treatment. The correlation curve, determined by ionized calcium and intact PTH values in each period, was found to shift in only 2 out of 5. During the 4 weeks of high dose oral 1,25(OH)2D3 therapy, mean blood pressure elevated from 92.4 +/- 3.3 to 103.5 +/- 3.5 mmHg (p less than 0.01) in general, and 7 patients out of 13 complained of mental irritability. These data suggest that oral administration of high dose 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses PTH secretion of uremic patients directly, however, reliability of this effect is still controversial. Indication of this therapy and adverse effects caused by rapid increase in serum calcium should be studied in more detail.
