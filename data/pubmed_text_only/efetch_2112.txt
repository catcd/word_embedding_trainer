Hemeoxygenase-1 induction in response to adverse circulatory conditions is protective. Our recent study has shown that administration of sirtinol attenuates hepatic injury in male Sprague-Dawley rats after trauma-hemorrhage; however, the mechanism by which sirtinol produces the salutary effects remains unknown. We hypothesized that sirtinol administration in male Sprague-Dawley rats after trauma-hemorrhage decreases cytokine production and protects against lung injury through a hemeoxygenase-1 related pathway.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8 per group) underwent trauma-hemorrhage (mean arterial blood pressure 40 mm Hg for 90 min, then resuscitation). A single dose of sirtinol (1 mg/kg of body weight) with or without a hemeoxygenase enzyme inhibitor (chromium-mesoporphyrin) or vehicle was administered IV during resuscitation. Twenty-four hours thereafter, myeloperoxidase activity (a marker of neutrophil sequestration) and tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 levels in the lung, protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and tissue histology were measured. Lung hemeoxygenase-1 protein level was also determined.
In the sirtinol-treated rats subjected to trauma-hemorrhage, there were significant improvements in lung myeloperoxidase activity (4.68 +/- 0.31 vs 9.36 +/- 1.03 U/mg protein, P < 0.05), tumor necrosis factor alpha levels (710.7 +/- 28 vs 1288 +/- 40.69 pg/mg protein, P < 0.05), interleukin-6 levels (343.6 +/- 18.41 vs 592.7 +/- 22.3 pg/mg protein, P < 0.05), and protein concentrations (303.8 +/- 24.54 vs 569.6 +/- 34.82 microg/mL, P < 0.05) and lesser damage in histology. There was no statistically significant difference in interleukin-10 levels in the lung between sirtinol-treated trauma-hemorrhaged rats and vehicle-treated trauma-hemorrhaged rats (842.5 +/- 54.18 vs 756.2 +/- 41.34 pg/mg protein, respectively). Lung hemeoxygenase-1 protein levels were increased in rats receiving sirtinol treatment as compared with vehicle-treated trauma-hemorrhaged rats (5.18 +/- 0.25 vs 2.70 +/- 0.16, P < 0.05). Administration of the hemeoxygenase inhibitor chromium-mesoporphyrin prevented the sirtinol-induced attenuation of shock-induced lung damage.
The salutary effects of sirtinol administration on attenuation of lung inflammation after trauma-hemorrhage are mediated via upregulation of hemeoxygenase-1 expression.
Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) are the "gold standard" for in vitro toxicity tests. However, 2D PHH cultures have limitations that are due to a time-dependent dedifferentiation process visible by morphological changes closely connected to a decline of albumin production and CYP450 activity. The 3D in vitro culture corresponds to in vivo-like tissue architecture, which preserves functional characteristics of hepatocytes, and therefore can at least partially overcome the restrictions of 2D cultures. Consequently, several drug toxicities observed in vivo cannot be reproduced in 2D in vitro models, for example, the toxic effects of acetaminophen. The objective of this study was to identify molecular differences between 2D and 3D cultivation which explain the observed toxicity response. Our data demonstrated an increase in cell death after treatment with acetaminophen in 3D, but not in 2D cultures. Additionally, an acetaminophen concentration-dependent increase in the CYP2E1 expression level in 3D cultures was detected. However, during the treatment with 10 mM acetaminophen, the expression level of SOD gradually decreased in 3D cultures and was undetectable after 24 h. In line with these findings, we observed higher import/export rates in the membrane transport protein, multidrug resistance-associated protein-1, which is known to be specific for acetaminophen transport. The presented data demonstrate that PHH cultured in 3D preserve certain metabolic functions. Therefore, they have closer resemblance to the in vivo situation than PHH in 2D cultures. In consequence, 3D cultures will allow for a more accurate hepatotoxicity prediction in in vitro models in the future.
Ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) (EBDC) fungicides are used heavily in the United States. EBDCs (e.g., mancozeb, maneb) are metabolized to ethylene thiourea (ETU). The EPA classifies ETU as a carcinogen, based on thyroid and other cancers in rodents, and has restricted the use of EBDCs, while requiring workers to use protective equipment. There are no data on the potential carcinogenicity of EBDCs in humans, and there is only one study on human genotoxicity. ETU is known to cause decreases of thyroxine (T4) and increases in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in rodents. We have studied cytogenetic outcomes and serum thyroid hormone levels among 49 heavily exposed workers without protective equipment spraying EBDC on tomatoes in Mexico. We also studied 14 lightly exposed landowners and 31 nonexposed controls. Urinary ETU was used to compare exposure between groups. We found an increase in TSH (p = 0.05) among applicators compared to controls, but no decrease in thyroid hormone (T4). We found increases in sister chromatid exchange (p = 0.03) and in chromosome translocations (chromosome aberrations that persist through cell division) for applicators compared to controls (p = 0.05). However, the subset of reciprocal translocations showed a lesser increase (p = 0.24). Our data suggest that EBDCs affect the thyroid gland and the lymphocyte genome among heavily exposed workers. However, our data are limited to subclinical outcomes, are of borderline statistical significance, and should be interpreted with caution.
We have described a patient who had acute oliguric renal failure after ingesting a single large overdose of ibuprofen. This patient had no predisposing underlying disease, and subsequently had complete resolution of renal failure.
Standard renal clearance techniques were used to investigate the acute effects of gentamicin on renal electrolyte handling in anesthetized rats. Data were obtained before substantial changes in tubular integrity would be expected to occur, thus permitting a distinction between the actions of the drug per se and renal changes resulting from underlying tubular damage. Infusion of gentamicin over a 3-hr period resulted in an immediate and sustained calciuresis and magnesiuresis, with no significant change in the renal clearance of sodium or potassium. Within 60 min of the onset of drug infusion at 0.28 mg/kg/min, renal calcium clearance (ml/min) increased from 0.095 +/- 0.013 to 0.210 +/- 0.016 (P less than .001) and renal magnesium clearance (ml/min) increased from 0.538 +/- 0.059 to 0.662 +/- 0.053 (P less than .01). Because it was subsequently shown that infusion of gentamicin did not alter glomerular filtration rate, it is clear that both responses resulted from a reduced tubular reabsorption of the respective ions; they were rapidly reversible when gentamicin infusion ceased. A higher dose of gentamicin (0.56 mg/kg/min for 3 hr) also significantly decreased plasma magnesium concentrations (0.40 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.49 +/- 0.02 mmol/l, treated vs. control; P less than .01). Gentamicin-induced changes in the renal handling of calcium and magnesium, therefore, occur independently of and before the development of nephrotoxicity. They may be at least partially responsible for the alteration in electrolyte homeostasis seen in humans during aminoglycoside treatment (e.g., hypomagnesemia). It is interesting to speculate on the possibility that they may also in some way contribute to the subsequent cellular injury that is known to occur with prolonged use of gentamicin.
To examine the effects of propranolol and nifedipine on exercise-induced attack in patients with variant angina, exercise 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy with quantitative analysis by emission-computed tomography was performed in 20 patients with variant angina after oral propranolol (80 mg), nifedipine (20 mg), and placebo. Exercise-induced attack occurred in 11 patients on placebo, in 14 on propranolol, and in none on nifedipine. The exercise duration was significantly shorter in those on propranolol (p less than .05), but significantly longer in patients on nifedipine (p less than .05) than in those on placebo. The peak rate-pressure product was significantly lower in patients on propranolol (p less than .01), but did not change in those on nifedipine, as compared with that in patients on placebo. The size of the perfusion defect as measured by 201Tl tomography was significantly greater in patients on propranolol (p less than .05), but significantly less in those on nifedipine (p less than .01) than in those on placebo. In conclusion, propranolol does not suppress but rather may aggravate exercise-induced attack in patients with variant angina, while nifedipine suppresses it. This unfavorable effect of propranolol on exercise-induced attack in patients with variant angina is likely to be due to a reduction of regional myocardial blood flow.
52 patients with acute neurotic anxious and psychosomatic syndromes or chronic anxious and vegetative neuroses were treated orally with the combination drug Betamed (1 tablet contain 60 mg bupranolol and 2.5 mg diazepam). The optimum daily dosage are 2 to 3 tablets; duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. The most responsive target symptoms are psychogenic disorders of the cardiovascular system, anxiety and insomnia, while no antidepressive effect was observed. Clinical improvement is often observed 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of treatment, and dosage reduction is possible frequently. Rarely observed side effects are minimal and mainly occur within one week after onset of treatment. Controls performed 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of treatment revealed reactivation of symptoms only in some patients with chronic anxiety and vegetative syndromes. In addition to the easy application and excellent tolerance of the combination drug emphasis is given on the minimal danger of drug dependence.
In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive a lidocaine patch or placebo applied on each side of the wound at the end of surgery. Data were collected for 24 h after surgery. Seventy patients completed the study (36 lidocaine group, 34 placebo group). Demographics and postoperative morphine consumption were not different between the groups. However, the lidocaine patch group reported significantly less pain on coughing (19%-33% reduction) over all time periods (treatment vs placebo P < 0.0001, time x treatment P = 0.3056) and at rest (17%-32% reduction) for up to 6 h (treatment vs placebo P = 0.0003, time x treatment P = 0.0130).
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial to determine if cephalothin plus an aminoglycoside is more nephrotoxic than methicillin plus an aminoglycoside, patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups: cephalothin and gentamicin (C.G.), cephalothin and tobramycin (C.T.), methicillin and gentamicin (M.G.), or methicillin and tobramycin (M.T.). The incidence of definite nephrotoxicity was: C.G., 7/23 (30.4%); C.T., 5/24 (20.8%); M.G., 2/20 (10%); and M.T., 1/23 (4.3%). There was no statistically significant difference in nephrotoxicity between the combined gentamicin groups (C.G. and M.G.) and the combined tobramycin groups (C.T. and M.T.). Definite nephrotoxicity developed in 12/47 (25.5%) of the combined cephalothin groups (C.G. and C.T.) and in only 3/43 (7%) of the combined methicilllin groups (M.G. and M.T.). The combination of cephalothin plus an aminoglycoside is therefore more nephrotoxic than the combination of methicillin plus an aminoglycoside.
Microcystin-producing Microcystis bloom is a severe water problem in the world. Some reports indicate that chronic exposure to microcystin may result in liver damage in adults, but information on effects in children is limited.
We investigated the relationship between microcystin exposure and liver damage in children.
We measured microcystin concentrations in drinking water and aquatic food (carp and duck) from two lakes and four wells. Participants were 1,322 children 7-15 years of age who obtained drinking water from one of the tested sources, completed questionnaires, and provided blood samples for serum liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT)] and serum microcystin analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with liver damage (two or more abnormal serum enzyme levels in ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT).
Microcystin was detected in most samples of water and aquatic food from two lakes. Children who drank water from the lake with the highest microcystin concentrations had a total estimated daily microcystin intake of 2.03 μg, a value much higher than the tolerable daily intake (0.40 μg) proposed by the World Health Organization for children. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, use of hepatotoxic medicines, and microcystin exposure were associated with liver damage. AST and ALP levels were significantly higher in high-microcystin-exposed children than in low-exposed children and unexposed children when participants who were HBV-positive or hepatotoxic medicine users were excluded from the analysis.
These results suggest that chronic exposure to microcystin may be associated with liver damage in children in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region.
Diclofenac sodium (Voltarol) was administered i.v. to 149 consecutive patients who were thought likely to benefit from its anti-inflammatory action. Patients were allocated randomly to one of two groups: group A received the undiluted i.m. preparation (25 mg ml-1) and group B the i.m. preparation diluted in normal saline (5 mg ml-1). Diclofenac 1 mg kg-1 administered over a 10-min period via a 23-gauge needle into a vein at either the antecubital fossa or the dorsum of the hand. No local or systemic problems were encountered in either group, at the time of injection. A high incidence of painless local venous thrombosis occurred in both hand and arm veins, 72 h after administration in group A (85% and 58%, respectively). The incidence of thrombosis was reduced markedly after administration of the diluted drug: 38% hand veins; 8% antecubital fossa veins.
This report describes a patient treated for metastatic leiomyosarcoma, who acutely developed doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and consequently developed heart failure. Medical therapy was initiated; however, her condition deteriorated and a surgical alternative was proposed. A biventricular assist device was implanted, allowing her multisystem organ failure to improve. During the next 9 days while on the assist device, her heart failure resolved, her organs were well perfused, and her heart entered a recovery period. After 9 days of mechanical support with the biventricular assist device, she was explanted from the assist device, and with inotropic support and an intra-aortic balloon pump, she maintained adequate hemodynamics. Eighteen days after implantation of the assist device, she was discharged from the hospital with hospice care, where she later died. Although the patient's cardiac function did not have long-term recovery, short-term recovery after doxorubicin toxicity was achieved. The authors maintain that the use of a biventricular assist device in the treatment of acute heart failure resulting from doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy is an effective way to manage this patient population.
Recent studies have shown that proto-oncogene c-fos mRNA is induced in the central nervous system by a variety of stimuli including generalised convulsions. In this study, the expression of c-fos protein (c-Fos) following lignocaine-induced convulsions was examined and compared with that following convulsions induced by non-anesthetic convulsants, such as pentylenetetrazol, kainic acid and electroconvulsive shocks, in rat brain. Administration of 120 mg.kg-1 lignocaine by the intraperitoneal route induced generalised convulsions in all rats examined within 10 min. C-Fos was markedly induced in the piriform cortex and amygdala, and slightly induced in the neocortex and thalamus, while no c-Fos expression was observed in the hippocampus. In contrast, c-Fos expression following generalised convulsions induced by non-anaesthetic convulsants was very marked in the hippocampal region, piriform cortex and amygdala, and extended to the thalamus and neocortex. These results contradict those of previously reported local cerebral metabolic studies using 2-deoxyglucose as a metabolic marker, and suggest that lignocaine-induced convulsions, unlike those induced by non-anaesthetic convulsants, may not cause severe sequelae (plastic changes) in the hippocampus.
The addition of capecitabine to docetaxel significantly improves overall survival in anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. We evaluated a low-dose capecitabine-docetaxel regimen as first-line therapy. Patients who had received adjuvant anthracyclines received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and capecitabine 950 mg/m2 twice daily, days 1-14, every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was time to progression. Forty-five patients were evaluable (median age 56 years, range 35-75). The response rate was 42%, including two complete responses. Nine patients (20%) attained stable disease. Median time to progression was 8 months and median overall survival was 23 months. Five patients (11%) experienced grade 3 neutropenia but febrile neutropenia was absent. Three patients (7%) experienced grade 3 hand-foot syndrome; there was no significant gastrointestinal toxicity. This capecitabine-docetaxel regimen is an active first-line therapy and appears better tolerated than regimens using a higher capecitabine dose. Data from the randomized trial comparing the registered versus a lower capecitabine dose, both in combination with docetaxel, should definitively answer whether a lower dose provides a better safety profile while maintaining the considerable efficacy of this combination.
A common side effect associated with succinylcholine is postoperative myalgia. The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence. We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia. The incidence and severity of succinylcholine-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine (n = 32 for each). Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant). At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia (not significant). In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline. We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported myalgia; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL-6 was found. In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine-associated myalgia.
Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine-induced postoperative myalgia. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between postoperative myalgia and time course of interleukin-6 concentrations, a marker of inflammation. Pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine.
The cutaneous signs of toxicomania are better known since the last two decades. We describe an original case of segmental necrotic and chronic livedo of the right arm associated with cocaine use.
A 31 year-old intravenous cocaine user presented a necrotic and painful livedo of the right arm. Two years before referral, localized recurrent edema was noted without general involvement. No local (infectious, vascular) or general (dysimmunity, coagulation abnormalities) aetiologies could be found. An amorphic substance composed of mineral bodies was found in the dermis, without damage to the vessels. Dramatic improvement was obtained with simple supportive care, while intravenous injections were stopped.
The vasoconstrictive properties of cocaine have been demonstrated in Raynaud's phenomenon, ischemia, focal necrosis of the extremities, and also in liver and kidney disorders. This drug has pharmacological effects on endothelial cells and coagulation, explaining the arterial and venous thrombosis reported. The foreign bodies found in our patient probably came from an intraarterial injection. The progressive and chronic evolution, without any evidence of thrombosis at the time of examination, are suggestive of the vasoconstrictive action of chronic dermal deposits.
Fluctuations in performance in patients with Parkinson's disease on chronic levodopa therapy (the "on-off" effect) are due to several factors. The increasing severity during treatment of early morning akinesia, "freezing" episodes, and end-of-dose deterioration are probably due to progression of the underlying disease. Peak-dose dyskinesia and peak-dose akinesia are due to levodopa over dosage. "Yo-yo-ing", which is the severest form of such fluctuation in mobility and dyskinesias, may represent the sum of these disorders.
Encephalopathy is a serious adverse reaction occurring in 15-30% of patients treated with the alkylating agent ifosfamide. Patients with this adverse effect may experience seizures, drowsiness, confusion and hallucinations of different grades of severity. In this article, we describe five cases of acute CNS toxicity in patients aged > or =65 years of age treated with ifosfamide and we review data on the management and outcome of this serious complication in elderly patients. All five patients experienced symptoms of encephalopathy soon after receiving combination chemotherapy including ifosfamide for different tumours. All of the patients had been assessed by means of a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for the presence of associated diseases, disability, cognitive status and depression, and scores were satisfactory in all patients, although case 5 was deemed frail because of cancer-related limitation in movement. In four patients, the antidote methylene blue (methylthioninium chloride) was administered intravenously, with successful recovery in three patients and a fatal outcome in the fourth patient. The fifth patient rapidly recovered after discontinuation of ifosfamide and did not receive methylene blue. The roles of older age, peak ifosfamide concentration, low albumin levels, increased serum creatinine and bulky abdominal disease as predisposing factors for ifosfamide-related encephalopathy in retrospective series are controversial.Although methylene blue has been frequently administered in patients with ifosfamide-related encephalopathy, its efficacy in this context has not been assessed objectively. Thus, careful baseline evaluation of elderly patients and constant clinical observation during infusion, especially during the first course of therapy, are recommended to reduce the risk of severe CNS toxicity from ifosfamide.
The effectiveness and safety of iv infused norepinephrine (0.5 to 1 microgram/kg X min) were evaluated in 12 hyperdynamic vasodilated septic patients, who remained hypotensive despite iv volume expansion and antimicrobial and dopamine therapy. During norepinephrine infusion, mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index increased (p less than .001) and heart rate decreased (p less than .02). Cardiac index either increased or was unchanged in ten patients and decreased slightly in the remaining two patients. Urine flow increased (p less than .01) and was more than 0.5 ml/min when a critical renal perfusion pressure was reached if renal damage was not overwhelming. We conclude that norepinephrine may improve arterial BP and urine flow when volume replacement and dopamine therapy have failed to reverse the hypotension of septic shock.
Immune/inflammatory cells act in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-affected patients by synthesizing several inflammatory mediators, including cytokines that initiate intracellular signaling. Recently, small molecule inhibitors of transduction and transcription signals that influence the intracellular pathways (such as the Janus kinase [JAK] family of tyrosine kinases) have been tested for RA treatment. Four members of the JAK family are known: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TyK2. JAK1/JAK3 constitutively binds to the cytoplasmic portion of the cytokine receptor - the common gamma chain - that represents a common subunit of several cytokines involved in T-cell and natural killer cell development, as well as in B-cell activation. Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor that is now available and effective in RA treatment, as shown in multiple Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. However, long-term safety data and comparisons with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and small molecule inhibitors are necessary to better determine the role of tofacitinib in RA.
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major neuropsychiatric complication of acute and chronic liver failure. Neuropathologically, HE in chronic liver failure is characterized by astrocytic (rather than neuronal) changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis and in altered expression of key astrocytic proteins. Magnetic resonance imaging in cirrhotic patients reveals bilateral signal hyperintensities in globus pallidus on T1-weighted imaging, which appear to result from manganese deposition. Proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows an increase in glutamine resonance in brain, a finding that confirms previous biochemical studies and is consistent with increased uptake of ammonia by the brain (glutamine synthesis). Recent molecular biological studies show an increased expression of several genes coding for neurotransmitter-related proteins in chronic liver failure. Such genes include those for monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), nitric oxide synthase (nNOS isoform) and the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. Activation of these systems may lead to alterations of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter function and changes in cerebral blood flow in chronic liver failure.
We report two renal transplant patients who experienced onset of severe bilateral knee pain 1 and 3 months after transplantation, respectively, while on tacrolimus therapy. Tacrolimus, like cyclosporine A, is an immunosuppressive agent that inactivates the enzyme calcineurin phosphatase. A bone pain syndrome was reported in 1989 in organ transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine A. Our cases suggest that tacrolimus may induce the same syndrome. Technetium 99m bone scanning shows increased uptake in the affected areas, and magnetic resonance imaging changes are consistent with bone marrow edema. The tacrolimus dosage need not be reduced unless trough levels are too high. The symptoms resolve completely within a few months. Imaging studies should be done to rule out avascular necrosis. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is discussed. Since tacrolimus was introduced recently, similar cases should be published.
Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, right heart catheterization, and systolic time intervals were done in 33 adult patients receiving doxorubicin (AdriamycinTM). Doxorubicin administration was associated with a dose-related increase in the degree of myocyte damage, and 27 of 29 patients biopsied at doses greater than or equal to 240 mg/m2 had doxorubicin-associated degenerative changes identified on biopsy. The pre-ejection period to left ventriculr ejection time ratio (PEP/LVET) showed a threshold phenomenon and did not begin to increase until a total dose of 400 mg/m2 had been reached. Seven patients with catheterization-proven heart failure had a significantly greater amount of myocyte damage on biopsy than dose-matched control subjects (P less than 0.01). Preveious mediastinal radiation appeared to potentiate the doxorubicin-associated degenerative process. Mediastinal radiation and age greater than or equal to 70 years appeared to be risk factors for doxorubicin-associated heart failure. Dose limitation by combined clinical, noninvasive, invasive, and morphologic criteria offered an advantage over empirical dose limitation or dose limitation by PEP/LVET alone.
Germ line missense mutations in the RET (rearranged during transfection) oncogene are the cause of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2 (MEN2), but at present surgery is the only treatment available for MEN2 patients. In this study, the ability of Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) to act as a RET inhibitor was investigated. Sorafenib inhibited the activity of purified recombinant kinase domain of wild type RET and RET(V804M) with IC(50) values of 5.9 and 7.9 nm, respectively. Interestingly, these values were 6-7-fold lower than the IC(50) for the inhibition of B-RAF(V600E). In cell-based assays, Sorafenib inhibited the kinase activity and signaling of wild type and oncogenic RET in MEN2 tumor and established cell lines at a concentration between 15 and 150 nm. In contrast, inhibition of oncogenic B-RAF- or epidermal growth factor-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation required micromolar concentrations of Sorafenib demonstrating the high specificity of this drug in targeting RET. Moreover, prolonged exposure to Sorafenib resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and RET protein degradation. Using lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors, we demonstrate that Sorafenib induces RET lysosomal degradation independent of proteasomal targeting. Furthermore, we provide a structural model of the Sorafenib.RET complex in which Sorafenib binds to and induces the DFG(out) conformation of the RET kinase domain. These results strengthen the argument that Sorafenib may be effective in the treatment of MEN2 patients. In addition, because inhibition of RET is not impaired by mutation of the Val(804) gatekeeper residue, MEN2 tumors may be less susceptible to acquired Sorafenib resistance.
The effect of halothane-induced hypotension on the development of postanesthetic myopathy was studied, using 6 healthy adult horses. Horses were anesthetized with halothane in oxygen for 3.5 hours on each of 2 occasions. Intermittent positive-pressure ventilation was used to maintain PaCO2 of 45 to 55 mm of Hg throughout both anesthetic exposures. By regulating the inspired halothane concentration, a mean arterial blood pressure of 85 to 95 mm of Hg (normotension) was maintained throughout the 1st anesthetic exposure, and a mean arterial blood pressure of 55 to 65 mm of Hg (hypotension) was maintained during the 2nd anesthetic exposure. All horses recovered uneventfully from normotensive anesthesia, but all had some muscle dysfunction after prolonged hypotensive anesthesia. Because of apparent animal discomfort and lameness involving more than 1 limb, 3 horses were euthanatized soon after they recovered from hypotensive anesthesia. The 3 other horses showed a degree of lameness. In addition, 1 horse had raised, swollen plaques over the hip, rib, and facial areas which were in contact with the surgical table, and another had evidence of facial nerve paralysis. One hour after the 6 horses stood after hypotensive anesthesia was completed, values obtained for aspartate transaminase and creatinine were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than those obtained after normotensive anesthesia was completed. Aspartate transaminase, total bilirubin, and creatinine values were significantly (P less than 0.05) increased when compared with those obtained before horses were anesthetized. A large increase was measured in creatine kinase. Twenty-four hours after hypotensive anesthesia was completed, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in the 3 surviving horses were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than those values after normotensive anesthesia was completed.
Exposure to air pollutants is suggested to adversely affect fetal growth, but the evidence remains inconsistent in relation to specific outcomes and exposure windows.
Using birth records from the two major maternity hospitals in Newcastle upon Tyne in northern England between 1961 and 1992, we constructed a database of all births to mothers resident within the city. Weekly black smoke exposure levels from routine data recorded at 20 air pollution monitoring stations were obtained and individual exposures were estimated via a two-stage modeling strategy, incorporating temporally and spatially varying covariates. Regression analyses, including 88,679 births, assessed potential associations between exposure to black smoke and birth weight, gestational age and birth weight standardized for gestational age and sex.
Significant associations were seen between black smoke and both standardized and unstandardized birth weight, but not for gestational age when adjusted for potential confounders. Not all associations were linear. For an increase in whole pregnancy black smoke exposure, from the 1(st) (7.4 μg/m(3)) to the 25(th) (17.2 μg/m(3)), 50(th) (33.8 μg/m(3)), 75(th) (108.3 μg/m(3)), and 90(th) (180.8 μg/m(3)) percentiles, the adjusted estimated decreases in birth weight were 33 g (SE 1.05), 62 g (1.63), 98 g (2.26) and 109 g (2.44) respectively. A significant interaction was observed between socio-economic deprivation and black smoke on both standardized and unstandardized birth weight with increasing effects of black smoke in reducing birth weight seen with increasing socio-economic disadvantage.
The findings of this study progress the hypothesis that the association between black smoke and birth weight may be mediated through intrauterine growth restriction. The associations between black smoke and birth weight were of the same order of magnitude as those reported for passive smoking. These findings add to the growing evidence of the harmful effects of air pollution on birth outcomes.
