Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), used widely in the manufacture of plastics, is a well-known reproductive toxicant. It causes apoptosis and loss of spermatogenic cells, resulting in testicular atrophy. Reports are scarce in the literature on the progression of apoptosis following repeated doses of phthalates. DEHP's mechanism of inducing testicular atrophy has been associated with depletion of zinc in the testis. ZnT-1 is a zinc transporter that is highly expressed in the testis. Thus, DEHP might exert its toxic effects on the testis by altering the expression of ZnT-1. In this regard, 25-day old Sprague-Dawley rats were given vehicle (5 ml corn-oil/kg, po) for 2, 7 and 14 days, or DEHP (2 g/5 ml corn-oil/kg, po) daily, for 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 days. Zinc content in testes was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and ZnT-1 mRNA was quantified by the branched DNA signal amplification method. Body weight gain and testicular weight (absolute and relative) were significantly lower in DEHP-treated rats. DEHP produced morphological changes in the testis, including apoptosis, necrosis, and loss of spermatogenic cells, which resulted in testicular atrophy. Apoptotic index (AI: the percentage of apoptotic cells in seminiferous tubules), determined using the TUNEL technique, was markedly increased after 1 day (AI: 2.9%, control AI: 0.1-0.3%) followed by a peak at 3 days (AI: 11.5%) and a gradual decrease till 10-14 days (AI: 7-9%). Zinc content in testis was not changed 1 day after DEHP administration, but decreased significantly at later time points. No difference was found in ZnT-1 mRNA expression between control and DEHP-treated animals until day 14. Our results suggest that apoptosis, along with necrosis, plays an important role in the mechanism of testicular atrophy by DEHP. In addition, ZnT-1 mRNA expression was not altered by DEHP and therefore, it appears that ZnT-1 cannot account for the decrease in testicular Zn content. Pathological lesions and apoptosis occurred prior to the loss of zinc in testis, suggesting that zinc depletion might be a secondary effect of DEHP-induced testicular toxicity, rather than the cause.
Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of the calcineurin signaling pathway in mediating the development of cardiac hypertrophy. It has also been reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) regressed cardiac hypertrophy in some animal and human models. In this study, we investigated the possible role of calcineurin in the regression of cardiac hypertrophy induced by the ACEI perindopril in rats with renovascular hypertension. The effect of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) was also studied. Starting from 2 months after a two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) procedure, the rats that had developed progressive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy were daily administered perindopril (1 mg/kg per day) or CsA (20 mg/kg per day) until 3 months. At the end of either treatment, the LV gravimetric, morphometric and histological measurements revealed the regression of LV hypertrophy; and the enzymatic assay, Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that both calcineurin activity and the calcineurin protein and mRNA expression levels were significantly decreased compared with untreated 2K1C rats, but that LV systolic performance was unchanged by either treatment. These data suggest that the cardiac hypertrophy regression induced by the ACEI perindopril is likely mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of the calcineurin signaling pathway.
Emerging evidence suggests that feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) to rodents affects the expression of genes involved in drug transport. However, gender-specific effects of HFD on drug transport are not known. The multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2, Abcc2) is a transporter highly expressed in the hepatocyte canalicular membrane and is important for biliary excretion of glutathione-conjugated chemicals. The current study showed that hepatic Mrp2 expression was reduced by HFD feeding only in female, but not male, C57BL/6J mice. In order to determine whether down-regulation of Mrp2 in female mice altered chemical disposition and toxicity, the biliary excretion and hepatotoxicity of the Mrp2 substrate, Î±-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), were assessed in male and female mice fed control diet or HFD for 4weeks. ANIT-induced biliary injury is a commonly used model of experimental cholestasis and has been shown to be dependent upon Mrp2-mediated efflux of an ANIT glutathione conjugate that selectively injures biliary epithelial cells. Interestingly, HFD feeding significantly reduced early-phase biliary ANIT excretion in female mice and largely protected against ANIT-induced liver injury. In summary, the current study showed that, at least in mice, HFD feeding can differentially regulate Mrp2 expression and function and depending upon the chemical exposure may enhance or reduce susceptibility to toxicity. Taken together, these data provide a novel interaction between diet and gender in regulating hepatobiliary excretion and susceptibility to injury.
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the duration of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) on subsequent cognitive function in rats. SE was induced by pilocarpine (320 mg/kg i.p.) and was terminated by injection of 1 mg/kg diazepam at 30, 60 and 90 min in 3 groups of 10 rats each. Cognitive function was tested by a passive avoidance task and was assessed at the baseline and on days 1, 7, 14 and 21 (post SE). It was found that cognitive function was disrupted on days 7, 14 and 21 post SE in rats who had SE for 60 and 90 min, whereas it was not affected in rats that had 30 min of SE. Hence, the duration of SE may affect future cognitive performance and mandates emergency treatment.
Plasma cholinesterase variants have been examined in blood samples obtained from 23 patients who, after an intravenous injection of suxamethonium 30 mg before e.c.t., had prolonged apnoea. Attempts have been made to screen the relatives of all patients shown to have an unusual plasma cholinesterase. The present study indicates an increased frequency of the fluoride-resistant variants in those psychiatric patients sensitive to suxamethonium.
Reactive oxygen species are produced in response to environmental toxins, and previous studies have suggested that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) damages a number of target organs through the generation of oxygen free radicals and oxidative stress. Upon exposure, TCDD becomes concentrated in adipose tissue, and adversely affects many organs, including liver. This study examined whether oxidative stress was induced in adipocytes and liver that were exposed to TCDD. 3T3-F442A adipocyte cultures were treated with TCDD (5-200 nM) for up to 72 h, and the activity and mRNA levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in adipocyte cell lysates were measured. The addition of 50 nM TCDD induced a two-fold increase in SOD activity after 48 h (P<0.05). In contrast, TCDD had no significant effect on the activity of catalase or GSH-Px in the adipocytes, and the increase in SOD activity was not accompanied by a change in SOD mRNA levels. To assess the effects of TCDD on oxidative stress enzymes in vivo, male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected weekly for 8 weeks with 30 ng/kg TCDD. In addition, the rats were fed either a low-fat complex-carbohydrate (LFCC) diet, or a high fat sucrose diet (HFS). The HFS diet has previously been shown to induce mild obesity and insulin resistance, without inducing diabetes. SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px activities were measured in the liver and adipose tissue of these rats. TCDD injection resulted in a 52% decrease in catalase activity in the adipose tissue of HFS rats (P<0.05). In contrast, SOD and GSH-Px activities were not altered in adipose tissue of TCDD-injected rats. In liver, however, there were significant decreases in GSH-Px activity in response to TCDD. This effect of TCDD was observed in both the LFCC and HFS dietary groups. In addition, GSH-Px activity in the HFS rats was significantly decreased when compared to GSH-Px activity in LFCC rats, in both TCDD-treated and control groups, suggesting that TCDD and a high fat diet may combine to exacerbate oxidative stress. Thus, TCDD induces complex changes in enzymes of oxidative stress in both adipocytes and liver. In adipocytes, these changes occurred post-transcriptionally, as there were no changes in mRNA levels. In addition, a high fat diet per se also resulted in a decrease in GSH-Px activity in liver.
Mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (mSOD1) gene are associated with a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and their expression in transgenic mice produces an ALS-like syndrome. Recent observations suggest a role for inflammatory-related events in the progression and propagation of the neurodegenerative process in ALS. Consistent with this view, the present study demonstrates that, during the course of the disease, the expression of cyclooxygenase type 2 (Cox-2), a key enzyme in the synthesis of prostanoids, which are potent mediators of inflammation, is dramatically increased. In both early symptomatic and end-stage transgenic mSOD1 mice, neurons and, to a lesser extent, glial cells in the anterior horn of the spinal cord exhibit robust Cox-2 immunoreactivity. Cox-2 mRNA and protein levels and catalytic activity are also significantly increased in the spinal cord of the transgenic mSOD1 mice. The time course of the spinal cord Cox-2 upregulation parallels that of motor neuronal loss in transgenic mSOD1 mice. We also show that Cox-2 activity is dramatically increased in postmortem spinal cord samples from sporadic ALS patients. We speculate that Cox-2 upregulation, through its pivotal role in inflammation, is instrumental in the ALS neurodegenerative process and that Cox-2 inhibition may be a valuable therapeutic avenue for the treatment of ALS.
Bleomycin is a radiomimetic antitumor agent with unique genotoxic properties. 1-nitropyrene is an environmental mutagen and carcinogen that undergoes both oxidative and reductive metabolism. In the present study, hepatocellular carcinomas were induced in male A/J mice by the intraperitoneal injection of bleomycin (120 mg/kg) followed by the intraperitoneal administration of 1-nitropyrene (total dose: 1,575 mg/kg). In order to understand the mechanism by which these two compounds induce hepatocellular carcinomas, the incidence and spectrum of mutations in the K-ras proto-oncogene in these hepatocellular carcinomas were analyzed. The hepatocellular carcinomas were induced by the administration of bleomycin and 1-nitropyrene were evaluated for point mutations in exon 1 and exon 2 of the K-ras gene by the polymerase chain reaction and a sequencing analysis. No mutation was found in the hotspots regions of the K-ras gene codon 12, 13, or 61. However, the codon 64 of the K-ras gene mutation was identified in 10 of 10 (100%) hepatocellular carcinomas. All mutations showed the same pattern, which was TAC-CAC transition. Codon 64 of the K-ras gene mutation may thus play an important role in the induction of hepatocellular carcinomas by bleomycin in the existence of 1-nitropyrene. As far as we know, this is the first report of a codon 64 mutation in the K-ras gene in a chemically induced tumor.
This report characterizes an atypical presentation of a thioridazine overdose. Clinical manifestations included wide Q.R.S. complex, hyperthermia, hypertension, hypertonia, and coma. Plasma catecholamine levels were markedly elevated. The patient was treated with dantrolene sodium and supportive care. The patient's condition improved over time, with questionable response to dantrolene sodium. Supportive care was the mainstay of treatment.
Renal EGF expression decreases in varying models of acute renal failure (ARF). We found previously that the loss of distal tubular EGF during gentamicin ARF is strongest in the cortex, where proximal tubular injury was most severe. To gain more insight into the mechanism underlying this apparent anatomical association, renal growth factor expression was investigated during mercuric chloride ARF, in which proximal tubular injury is most severe in the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OSOM).
Endogenous renal growth factor expression was investigated by RNA hybridization and by immunohistochemistry in a rat model of mercuric chloride ARF. In addition we determined temporal and spatial profiles of tubular injury, cell proliferation, and mononuclear cell infiltration during the 3-week observation period.
Serum creatinine values were maximal 2 days after treatment and were again normalized at day 6. Tubular injury was most severe in the PST and maximal at day 2. Cell proliferation was also higher in the PST and maximal at day 4. Three weeks after treatment, normal renal morphology was restored. Increased numbers of mononuclear cells appeared transiently in the renal interstitium from day 1 on. Most of these cells were macrophages and T lymphocytes; macrophages surrounded preferentially the severely injured PST in the OSOM. In analogy to gentamicin ARF, renal EGF and IGF-I gene expression were decreased early in the setting of mercuric chloride ARF. The decrease in distal tubular EGF staining was most pronounced in the OSOM, i.e. the anatomical area where mercuric-chloride-induced proximal tubular injury was most severe.
Renal EGF and IGF-I gene expression decreases strongly during mercuric chloride ARF. The spatial association between the initial decrease of distal tubular EGF expression and the zone of major proximal tubular injury could originate from metabolic alterations secondary to oxygen starvation. A possible role of mononuclear cells remains to be determined.
We report a case of Hodgkin disease presenting with a subacute myelopathy without evidence of metastatic involvement of the spinal cord. The systemic disease responded to conventional chemotherapy, but the myelopathy only improved after intrathecal dexamethasone was added to the treatment program, beta-2-microglobulin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated at presentation. Following the use of intrathecal corticosteroids there was a decrease of CSF beta-2-microglobulin levels. The possible significance of these findings is discussed.
to evaluate the activity and toxicity of the combination cisplatin plus vinorelbine plus amifostine in advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
a two-stage Simon design was applied. To proceed after the first stage, responses from seven of 19 patients were needed. Overall, 17 responses from 40 treated patients were required to comply with the design parameter. Inclusion criteria were cyto-histologically proven stage IIIB-IV NSCLC; age of 70 years or less; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less; normal cardiac, hepatic, renal and bone marrow functions; and no previous chemotherapy. Patients were staged by physical examination, biochemistry, chest radiograph, brain, thoracic and abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans, and bone scan. All patients received cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) intravenously (iv) day 1, vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) iv days 1-8-15-22, amifostine 740 mg/m(2) iv day 1 every 4 weeks up to six cycles. Eleven of 40 enrolled patients were stage IIIB and 29 stage IV, with a median age of 57 years (range, 38-70 years).
all patients were evaluable for response and toxicity (intention to treat analysis). We observed 20 (50%) objective responses, with four (10%) complete responses. Median time to progression was 20 weeks, and median survival was 45 weeks. The toxicity was manageable. The reported main toxicities were neutropenia grade 4 in 10% of patients, grade 1 and grade 3 nephrotoxicity both in 5% of patients and grade 1 amifostine-related hypotension in 15% of patients.
these data show that cisplatin plus vinorelbine plus amifostine is an active and feaseable regimen in stage IIIB-IV NSCLC. A phase III trial comparing cisplatin plus vinorelbine versus cisplatin plus vinorelbine plus amifostine in advanced NSCLC is warranted.
We recently reported that short-term treatment with KAT-681 (KAT), a liver-selective thyromimetic, inhibits the development of preneoplastic lesions in rat livers and may be a candidate chemopreventive agent for hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, time-course observations of hepatocellular proliferative lesions were carried out during short-term and long-term treatment with KAT to investigate its anti-hepatocarcinogenic effects. The hepatocellular proliferative lesions in male F344 rats were induced by the initiation treatment of diethylnitrosamine (DEN), followed by treatment with 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) and partial hepatectomy (PH). The rats were administered KAT orally at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks (experiment 1) or 0.1 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks (experiment 2). In experiment 1, a serial reduction in the number of altered hepatocellular foci (AHF) with positive expression of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) was observed until day 14 of the treatment period. The proliferative index (PI) of hepatocytes in the AHF significantly increased in the KAT group throughout the treatment period, with a peak on day 2. KAT treatment showed no obvious effects on GST-P-positive hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) at any time point. In contrast, long-term KAT treatment in experiment 2 revealed a reduction in the mean size of HCAs in addition to reductions in the number and mean size of AHF. The PIs within the lesions in KAT-treated rats were significantly lower than those in controls. The present study indicates that KAT has different inhibitory effects on hepatocarcinogenesis in the early and late phases of KAT treatment; there is a reduction in AHF with enhanced cell proliferation in the early phase and the inhibition of development of AHF and HCAs with suppression of cell proliferation in the late phase. These results may suggest further potential of KAT as a promising chemopreventive agent for hepatocarcinogenesis.
A patient with schizoaffective disorder developed signs of catatonia while on a regimen of valproic acid, sertraline, and risperidone. The catatonic features evolved for the first time after a single dose of valproate and were alleviated by lorazepam. The same catatonic signs recurred after a second dose of valproate and again remitted after lorazepam. Catatonia did not recur subsequent to discontinuing valproate, and the patient had tolerated the combination of valproate and risperidone in the past without developing catatonia. Although the catatonia in this case initially appears to be paradoxical, the phenomenon is actually consistent with current models of catatonia. A unique drug interaction may account for this phenomenon. Possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic explanations are discussed, including the relation of catatonia to increased activity of the medial globus pallidus and current models of catatonia.
1-Hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU) was administered orally to 63 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a daily dose of 200 to 600 mg. Twenty three of those patients who received HCFU over 4 weeks without any other therapies were studied for its antitumor effect. Eighteen patients were evaluated for tumor size. The results showed a response rate of 16.7% (3/18) based on the criteria of Koyama et al. Patients with minute hepatoma had an especially good response; the response rate being 40% (2/5), or 60% (3/5) including minor response. Tests showed no aggravation of liver function. HCFU was considered to be useful in the treatment of HCC. However, unexpected adverse neurological effects were encountered in 6 patients. They began with slurred speech, bradypragia and gait disturbance, and finally progressed to unconsciousness in 4 out of 6 patients, in which the clinical picture resembled hepatic encephalopathy. Though reversible, these symptoms necessitate immediate withdrawal of HCFU therapy.
To examine the effects of FK506 on glutamate neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons.
Experiments were performed with primary retinal cultures obtained from 17- to 19-day-old rat fetuses. To assess the effects of FK506 and other drugs on glutamate neurotoxicity, cultures were treated with a drug beginning 10 minutes before application of glutamate and continuing during the subsequent 10 minutes of glutamate exposure. The treated cells were then incubated for 1 hour in a drug-free and glutamate-free medium. After a 1-hour incubation, cell viability was quantitatively measured by the trypan blue exclusion method.
Brief exposure to glutamate markedly decreased cell viability. FK506 protected against glutamate neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Rapamycin is a competitive inhibitor of FK506 that binds FK506 binding protein. Simultaneous application of rapamycin and FK506 negated the protective effects of FK506. Cyclosporin A, which binds and inhibits calcineurin, mimicked the protective effects of FK506. Treatment with FK506 did not affect the intracellular maximum Ca2+ concentration induced by glutamate application. Although FK506 exhibited protective action against Ca2+ ionophore-induced neurotoxicity, it had no effect on nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity. Treatment with FK506 reduced the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS).
FK506 protected against glutamate neurotoxicity by inhibiting NOS activity in cultured retinal neurons.
The undesirable effects of high-dose methotrexate on integument and mucosa are well-known, but lesions of the skin proper, characterized by distal erythema with desquamation, are rare. We report the case of a male patient presenting with extensive skin erosions after intravenous infusion of a 5 gram total dose of methotrexate to treat high-grade lymphoma. The skin disease was accompanied by renal, hepatic and mucosal lesions, as well as bone marrow aplasia. The mechanism of cutaneous necrosis is uncertain, but it might be due to direct toxicity of methotrexate to the epidermis. The patient was also treated with G-CSF. He recovered from aplasia within 6 days, without infectious complications. Haematopoietic growth factors might have reduced the risk of infection arising from the skin, by shortening the duration of cytopenia.
Tea flavonoids such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) protect against vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis via their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions. Persistent and widespread environmental pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), can induce oxidative stress and inflammation in vascular endothelial cells. Even though PCBs are no longer produced, they are still detected in human blood and tissues and thus considered a risk for vascular dysfunction. We hypothesized that EGCG can protect endothelial cells against PCB-induced cell damage via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. To test this hypothesis, primary vascular endothelial cells were pretreated with EGCG, followed by exposure to the coplanar PCB 126. Exposure to PCB 126 significantly increased cytochrome P450 1A1 (Cyp1A1) mRNA and protein expression and superoxide production, events which were significantly attenuated following pretreatment with EGCG. Similarly, EGCG also reduced DNA binding of NF-ÎºB and downstream expression of inflammatory markers such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1) after PCB exposure. Furthermore, EGCG decreased endogenous or base-line levels of Cyp1A1, MCP-1 and VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. Most of all, treatment of EGCG upregulated expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-controlled antioxidant genes, including glutathione S transferase (GST) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, silencing of Nrf2 increased Cyp1A1, MCP-1 and VCAM-1 and decreased GST and NQO1 expression, respectively. These data suggest that EGCG can inhibit AhR regulated genes and induce Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzymes, thus providing protection against PCB-induced inflammatory responses in endothelial cells.
The DNA repair and detoxifying enzymes, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), may be responsible fpr poor response to alkylating agents in glioblastoma treatment. The methylation of MGMT promoter and the expression of MGMT and GST were highly heterogeneous in surgical specimens of human glioblastoma and in established human glioblastoma cells under 2-D and 3-D culture conditions, suggesting an intrinsic property of these cells. MGMT and GST expression did not predict the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to alkylating agents. Combination of alkylating agents with inhibitors of GST disclosed additive effects, suggesting that inhibition of GST should be considered in glioblastoma therapy.
Sensory neuropathies developed in three of four patients with prurigo nodularis who had been treated with thalidomide. The serum samples of the patients who had neuropathy produced morphologic changes in cultured dorsal root ganglion cells. These observed changes support the postulate that thalidomide induces primary neuronal degeneration.
Thalidomide is effective for the treatment of severe cutaneous lupus. Our aim was to study the safety and efficacy of different doses of thalidomide in this condition.
We studied patients with severe cutaneous lupus that was unresponsive to antimalarials, prednisolone, methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclosporin A. Starting doses of 100 mg daily (n = 16 patients), 50 mg daily (n = 17), or 50 mg on alternate days (n = 15) were compared. The response to thalidomide was categorized as complete remission, partial remission, or no visible improvement. All patients received a baseline electromyogram (EMG) followed by repeat EMG every 3 to 6 months, or sooner if neuropathic symptoms developed.
Forty-eight patients (46 female; mean [+/- SD] age, 44 +/- 12 years; range, 22 to 71 years) with discoid lupus (n = 18), subacute cutaneous lupus (n = 6), or systemic lupus erythematosus with skin involvement (n = 24) were included. The response rate was 81%, including 29 patients (60%) in complete remission and 10 (21%) in partial remission. Nine patients (19%) failed to respond. Thirteen patients (27%) developed peripheral neuropathy, which was EMG-proven in 11, including 4 patients in the 50-mg alternate-day group. Other side effects included drowsiness, constipation or abdominal pain, and amenorrhea. The relapse rate after stopping thalidomide was 67% (26/39). There was no association between a positive response to the drug and either starting doses or cumulative dose. Similarly, no association was found between peripheral neuropathy and the starting or cumulative dose.
Thalidomide is effective for the treatment of severe cutaneous lupus. There were no clear dose-dependent effects. However, the high incidence of neurotoxicity, even at low doses, suggests that it may be most useful as a remission-inducing drug.
Many reports have inferred that macrophages can interact with tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a vicious cycle of tumor development; however, the changes in gene expression in tumor cells under the effects of macrophages are still largely unknown. The present study was carried out to illustrate the changes in the gene expression profile in lung cancer cells under the effects of macrophage-conditioned medium. Gene expression profile data were derived from the GEO database GSE9315. The GSM234968 sample was derived from a highly invasive human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line, CL1-5, and was treated with conditioned medium (supernatant of a culture solution of human monocyte THP-1). The GSM234967 sample that was not treated with the conditioned medium was used as a control. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were carried out using DAVID software, and visualization networks were constructed using Cytoscape software. The results showed that 40 differentially expressed genes were annotated. Five differentially expressed transcription factors were identified, EIF2B4, EIF2B5, JUNB, GNG11 and HMGB2, which were all related to 'stress' and 'responses'. The gene cluster of JUNB was mainly enriched in cancer-related pathways, 'Wnt signaling pathway' and 'MAPK signaling pathway'. Finally, 10 small molecules, thioridazine, resveratrol, astemizole, ciclopirox, calmidazolium, etoposide, anisomycin, pyrvinium, azacyclonol and terfenadine, which may act on transcription factors, were identified using the CMap database. In conclusion, we identified transcription factors playing key roles in tumor cells under the effects of macrophages in order to provide new clues for blocking this vicious cycle of tumor development.
Acetone potentiation of haloalkane-induced liver injury is a well-known phenomenon. Acetone-treated rats challenged with a trichloroethylene-CCl4 mixture exhibit a more sever liver injury than that predicted by the addition of the single potentiating effects of each. The purpose of the present study was to determine if acetone exerted similar interactions with other haloalkane mixtures. The testing protocol used was designed and performed to allow categorization of interactions occurring among two or three agents. Rats were treated (p.o.) with corn oil or acetone (10.2 mmol/kg) and were administered (i.p.) 18 h later 1,1-dichloroethylene (0.6 mmol/kg), trichloroethylene (5.6 mmol/kg), tetrachloroethylene (19.6 mmol/kg), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (10.0 mmol/kg), 1,1,2-trichloroethane (1.1 mmol/kg), 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (1.0 mmol/kg), CHCl3 (6.2 mmol/kg), CCl4 (1.0 mmol/kg), or a mixture of two haloalkanes (all 28 combinations were tested). Liver injury was assessed 24 h later using plasma alanine aminotransferase activity and a quantitative histological evaluation. In corn oil pretreated rats, the hepatotoxic responses observed for the 28 mixtures were additive for 26 of 28 mixtures and supra-additive for 2 of 28, whereas in acetone-pretreated rats the responses observed were additive for 17 of 28, infra-additive for 10 of 28, and supra-additive for 1 of 28. Mixtures containing 1,1,1-trichloroethane or tetrachloroethylene resulted only in no change in toxicity or infra-additivity. Increased toxic responses (additivity and supra-additivity) were observed with certain binary mixtures containing CCl4, CHCl3, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, or 1,1-dichloroethylene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the recommended first-line antihypertensive treatment for managing chronic kidney disease, and strict blood pressure (BP) regulation is crucial for the reduction of proteinuria. Valsartan and candesartan are commonly used ARBs in Japan, with maximum permissible doses of 160 mg/day and 12 mg/day, respectively. We evaluated BP and proteinuria after changeover from the maximum dose of candesartan to the maximum dose of valsartan, in 55 poorly controlled hypertensive patients undergoing candesartan treatment who were unable to achieve optimal BP according to the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2004). We measured BP and pulse rate and assessed urinary protein excretion (UPE) before and after changeover. Changeover was associated with decreases in systolic BP and diastolic BP from 158/89 mmHg to 150/86 mmHg (p<0.01). Changeover was also associated with a reduction in UPE adjusted to urinary creatinine from 0.35+/-0.19 g/g creatinine to 0.19+/-0.37 g/g creatinine (p=0.0271) in patients who had high urinary protein levels prior to changeover without significant decreases in BP (p=0.0184). According to multiple regression analysis, higher UPE (p<0.0001) and a lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (p=0.0011) prior to changeover were independently correlated with reduction in UPE. Our results suggest that the maximum dose of valsartan is more effective than the maximum dose of candesartan for reducing BP and proteinuria.
The present study was designed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of Ï-conotoxin (Ï-CTX) in a cell-based model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using cultured PC12 cells incubated with Î²-amyloid (AÎ²). Immunohistochemical staining, Western blot, MTT and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis were employed to assess the cell viability and cell death. AÎ² in this model was clearly neurotoxic, inducing necrosis and apoptosis. Ï-CTX antagonized the effects of AÎ²: there was an increase in cell viability and a suppression of inflammatory- and oxidative stress-related factors. These data suggest that Ï-CTX may have neuroprotective actions against AÎ²-induced neurotoxicity. The significance of these new findings relative to the etiology and treatment of AD is discussed.
C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein in humans. Elevated levels of CRP are produced in response to inflammatory cytokines and are associated with atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance. Exposure to inorganic arsenic, a common environmental toxicant, also produces cardiovascular disorders, namely atherosclerosis and is associated with insulin-resistance. Inorganic arsenic has been shown to contribute to cardiac toxicities through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that result in the activation of NFÎºB. In this study we show that exposure of the hepatic cell line, HepG2, to environmentally relevant levels of arsenite (0.13 to 2 Î¼M) results in elevated CRP expression and secretion. ROS analysis of the samples showed that a minimal amount of ROS are produced by HepG2 cells in response to these concentrations of arsenic. In addition, treatment of FvB mice with 100 ppb sodium arsenite in the drinking water for 6 months starting at weaning age resulted in dramatically higher levels of CRP in both the liver and inner medullary region of the kidney. Further, mouse Inner Medullary Collecting Duct cells (mIMCD-4), a mouse kidney cell line, were stimulated with 10 ng/ml CRP which resulted in activation of NFÎºB. Pretreatment with 10 nM Y27632, a known Rho-kinase inhibitor, prior to CRP exposure attenuated NFÎºB activation. These data suggest that arsenic causes the expression and secretion of CRP and that CRP activates NFÎºB through activation of the Rho-kinase pathway, thereby providing a novel pathway by which arsenic can contribute to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.
