The CRX (cone-rod homeobox) gene is specifically expressed in developing and mature photoreceptors and encodes an otd/Otx-like paired homeodomain protein. Mutant alleles of the CRX gene have recently been associated with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) as well as dominant Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Since LCA is more commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, we examined a cohort of recessive LCA patients for CRX mutations. A homozygous substitution of arginine (R) at codon 90 by tryptophan (W) was identified in the CRX homeodomain of one of the probands who was nearly blind from birth. A group of 48 control individuals and 190 previously characterized CORD probands did not reveal this sequence change. The mutant CRXR90W homeodomain demonstrated decreased binding to the previously identified cis sequence elements in the rhodopsin promoter. In transient transfection experiments, the mutant protein showed significantly reduced ability to transactivate the rhodopsin promoter, as well as lower synergistic activation with the bZIP transcription factor NRL. Heterozygosity of the mutant CRX (R90W) allele was detected in both parents and in an older sibling. Ophthalmologic examination and electro-retinography revealed a subtle abnormality of cone function in both the parents. These data suggest that the R90W mutation results in a CRX protein with reduced DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory activity and that the subsequent changes in photoreceptor gene expression lead to the very early onset severe visual impairment in LCA.
Fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective for the treatment of depression in the elderly and offer a safer side-effect profile as compared to tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. We report a case in which a patient treated with fluoxetine developed parkinsonism following the introduction of cimetidine. Inhibition of hepatic P450 cytochrome enzymes by cimetidine with an increase in serum levels of norfluoxetine may have precipitated this extrapyramidal syndrome, which has been related to agonism of the serotonergic input to nigrostriatal tracts and basal ganglia. Parkinsonism as a side effect of SSRIs occurs infrequently, suggesting an idiosyncratic response resulting from a functional imbalance of serotonergic and dopaminergic activity in susceptible individuals. Careful monitoring of geriatric patients treated with fluoxetine is indicated, particularly for those on high doses, those with impaired hepatic functioning, or those treated with concurrent medications that slow the metabolism of fluoxetine.
A patient with ergot intoxication due to medication for migraine developed lateral popliteal nerve palsy. This is attributed to recurrent ischaemia caused by ergotamine.
Small conductance calcium (Ca(2+)) activated SK channels are critical regulators of neuronal excitability in hippocampus. Accordingly, these channels are thought to play a key role in controlling neuronal activity in acute models of epilepsy. In this study, we investigate the expression and function of SK channels in the pilocarpine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. For this purpose, protein expression was assessed using western blotting assays and gene expression was analyzed using TaqMan-based probes and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) comparative method delta-delta cycle threshold ( big up tri, open big up tri, openCT) in samples extracted from control and epileptic rats. In addition, the effect of SK channel antagonist UCL1684 and agonist NS309 on CA1 evoked population spikes was studied in hippocampal slices. Western blotting analysis showed a significant reduction in the expression of SK1 and SK2 channels at 10days following status epilepticus (SE), but levels recovered at 1month and at more than 2months after SE. In contrast, a significant down-regulation of SK3 channels was detected after 10days of SE. Analysis of gene expression by qPCR revealed a significant reduction of transcripts for SK2 (Kcnn1) and SK3 (Kcnn3) channels as early as 10days following pilocarpine-induced SE and during the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model. Moreover, bath application of UCL1684 (100nM for 15min) induced a significant increase of the population spike amplitude and number of spikes in the hippocampal CA1 area of slices obtained control and chronic epileptic rats. This effect was obliterated by co-administration of UCL1684 with SK channel agonist NS309 (1microM). Application of NS309 failed to modify population spikes in the CA1 area of slices taken from control and epileptic rats. These data indicate an abnormal expression of SK channels and a possible dysfunction of these channels in experimental MTLE.
Various strategies have been studied to reduce the discomfort of rocuronium pain. These studies have shown fentanyl and lidocaine to be effective in reducing the incidence of pain on rocuronium injection. This prospective, randomized, and double-blind study was carried out on 80 neurosurgical patients for whom pain on rocuronium injection was assessed after pretreatment with lidocaine, fentanyl, sufentanil, or normal saline. The 80 neurosurgical patients were randomly allocated to anyone of the groups to receive lidocaine, fentanyl, sufentanil, or normal saline prior to being given rocuronium. The patients were asked about any discomfort in the hand, and also to rank that discomfort on a 5-point scale. In the normal saline group, the incidence of pain was 95%, of which 90% had very severe pain. In the lidocaine group, only 10% of patients reported pain, which was mild in nature. In the fentanyl group, 95% of patients had pain, of whom 25% had severe to very severe pain. In the sufentanil group, 85% of patients reported pain, of whom 25% fell into the severe to very severe group. We found that lidocaine was best at decreasing the incidence of pain on intravenous (i.v.) injection of rocuronium. Although the incidence of pain on injection of rocuronium with both fentanyl and sufentanil was high, the intensity was definitely reduced, with most patients falling in the mild pain group.
We present a case involving a 66-year-old woman with a history of childhood somnambulism who presented with a recent recurrence of sleepwalking. The diagnosis of somnambulism was confirmed polysomnographically and linked etiologically to the start of using metoprolol, a lipophilic beta-blocker, for treating her hypertension. The parasomnia disappeared completely after discontinuation of the drug. Recurrence of non-REM parasomnias, such as somnambulism, has previously been described as an adverse effect of the beta-blocker, propranolol, solely in patients with migraine. There was no history of migraine in the patient presented here. The clinical significance of the findings and possible underlying mechanisms are discussed.
We report three cases of unusual tubal-type endocervical glandular proliferations simulating minimal deviation adenocarcinoma in women with a history of in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure. The lesions were characterized by haphazard glandular proliferations extending from 3.4 to 6.1 mm into the endocervical stroma and to the margins of excision in all cases. Most of the glands were small to medium-sized and round; some exhibited a moderate degree of cystic dilatation, and occasional glands had curvilinear profiles. The glandular epithelium displayed extensive tubal-type differentiation in all cases. In two cases, the glands lacked cytologic atypia and mitotic activity, and in one case, there was mild to moderate nuclear atypia with occasional mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical studies showed diffuse expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and essentially no expression of p16 in two cases tested; there was no expression of CD10 in one case that was tested. The Ki-67 proliferation index was zero in one case and 25% in another. Human papillomavirus DNA was not detected by in situ hybridization in one case that was tested. The proliferations lacked features of mucinous and tubo-endometrioid types of minimal deviation adenocarcinoma. The clinicopathologic findings suggest the lesions are benign, and the association with in utero DES exposure raises the possibility that these could be a form of DES-related adenosis.
Most patients with diabetes die from cardiac or arterial disease, for which there are limited therapeutic options. Free Cu(2+) ions are strongly pro-oxidant, and chelatable-Cu(II) is increased in the diabetic heart. We reported previously that treatment by Cu(II)-selective chelation with triethylenetetramine (TETA) evokes elevated urinary Cu(II) in diabetic rats and humans in whom it also improved hallmarks of established left ventricular (LV) disease. Here, we treated diabetic rats with TETA and evaluated its ability to ameliorate Cu(2+)-mediated LV and arterial damage by modifying the expression of molecular targets that included transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, Smad4, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), and heparan sulfate (HS). Eight-weeks of TETA treatment significantly improved cardiac diastolic function but not [glucose](plasma) in diabetic animals. LV and aortic mRNAs corresponding to TGF-beta1, Smad4, collagen types I, III, and IV, and fibronectin-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, were elevated in untreated diabetic animals and normalized after TETA treatment. EC-SOD mRNA and protein, and [HS](tissue) were significantly decreased in diabetes and restored by drug treatment. Candidate molecular mechanisms by which TETA could ameliorate diabetic cardiac and arteriovascular disease include the suppression of an activated TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway that mediates increased ECM gene expression and restoration of normal EC-SOD and HS regulation. These findings are relevant to the restoration toward normal by TETA treatment of cardiac and arterial structure and function in diabetes.
Lung fibrosis can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension, limiting exercise tolerance and life expectancy. Furthermore, vasodilators might cause deterioration in gas exchange. Our aim was to compare acute effects of sildenafil, nitric oxide, and epoprostenol in individuals with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung fibrosis.
We did a randomised controlled, open-label trial, in 16 individuals admitted to our hospital with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung fibrosis. After inhalation of nitric oxide (10-20 ppm), we assigned patients to either maximum tolerated dose of intravenous epoprostenol (mean 8.0 ng/kg per min; n=8) or oral sildenafil (50 mg; n=8). Our primary objective was to assess pulmonary vasodilative potency (decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance index) of sildenafil by comparison with inhaled nitric oxide and infused epoprostenol. Analyses were by intention to treat.
Pulmonary vascular resistance index was reduced by nitric oxide (-21.9%, 95% CI -14.1 to -36.2), epoprostenol (-36.9%, -24.4 to -59.6), and sildenafil (-32.5%, -10.2 to -54.1). However, ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance decreased only in individuals who received nitric oxide and sildenafil. Baseline measurement of multiple-inert-gas elimination showed right-to-left shunt flow (4.8%, 0.0-28.2) and little perfusion of low ventilation(V)/perfusion(Q) areas (0.1%, 0.0-13.0). Prostacyclin increased V/Q mismatch (shunt 16.8%, 10.8-35.9; low V/Q 3.8%, 0.0-13.0) and decreased arterial oxygenation. By contrast, nitric oxide (4.5%, 0.0-18.0; 0.0%, 0.0-17.3) and sildenafil (3.3%, 0.0-11.3; 0.0%, 0.0-12.4) maintained V/Q matching, with raised arterial partial pressure of oxygen (14.3 mm Hg, -1.7 to 31.3) noted for sildenafil. We recorded no adverse events.
Sildenafil causes preferential pulmonary vasodilation and improves gas exchange in patients with severe lung fibrosis and secondary pulmonary hypertension.
Long-term experience with intracavernous self-injection of papaverine in 36 patients with erectile failure is reported. The average required dose of papaverine in 2037 documented injections was 31.5 mg. The rate of complications was low with a mean follow-up of 6.9 months. Prolonged erections occurred four times. Two patients reported the development of tolerance. In one man circumscribed induration of the tunica albuginea was observed, which disappeared spontaneously after change of the injection site. No infections of the corpora cavernosa, circulatory disturbances or signs of hepatotoxicity were observed.
Ambulatory autoinjection therapy of the corpus cavernosum with a vasoactive drug combination for vasculogenic and neurogenic erectile dysfunction was performed in 50 men from 10/85-6/87. Acceptance was excellent by all patients and their wives. Transitory hematomas appeared in 6/50 (12%) cases. Local infections, cavernitis or systemic side effects were not observed. In 3/50 (6%) patients prolonged erections occurred. Treatment included drainage of the intracavernous blood, manual decompression and if necessary additional application of 1 mg metaraminol under extreme caution. Only 1 (2%) patient developed a nodular tunica fibrosis at the injection site which disappeared spontaneously upon cessation of treatment within 4 weeks.
The NOA-05 multicenter trial was performed to analyze the efficacy of primary chemotherapy with procarbazine and lomustine (PC) in patients with gliomatosis cerebri (GC) and to define clinical, imaging, and molecular factors influencing outcome.
Thirty-five patients with previously untreated GC were treated with up to six 56-day courses of 110mg/m(2) lomustine on day 1 and 60mg/m(2) procarbazine on days 8 to 21. The primary endpoint was the rate of patients without therapy failure (defined as progressive disease, death from any cause, or termination of PC therapy before the end of course 4) at 8 months after the beginning of PC chemotherapy.
The failure-free survival rate at 8 months was 50.3%. Median progression-free survival was 14 months. At progression, 12 patients received salvage radiotherapy. Median overall survival was 30 months. Multivariate analysis revealed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene mutation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.58) and initial presentation without a bilateral symmetrical infiltration pattern on magnetic resonance imaging (HR 0.07, 95%CI 0.01-0.54) as independent prognostic factors associated with prolonged survival. IDH1 mutation was significantly associated with MGMT promoter methylation and an oligodendroglial tumor component.
PC chemotherapy is effective in GC. With the NOA-05 trial being the first prospective multicenter trial in GC, PC chemotherapy can be regarded as a promising option for the primary therapy of these tumors.
Paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizer, is an effective agent for treating cancer of the breast, ovary, head and neck, and lung. Because paclitaxel is insoluble in water, it is formulated with the micelle-forming Cremophor EL. Neurologic toxicity is well described with both the drug and this carrier, with most toxicities manifesting as peripheral neuropathy, motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and myopathy. Toxic effects on the central nervous system, such as seizures or encephalopathy, have been rarely reported; however, the seizures reported were closely related to the time of infusion. We describe a 41-year-old woman with no history of seizures who was treated with paclitaxel for breast cancer. Four days after the drug was infused, she developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that could not be attributed to other causes. The patient was treated with phenytoin and was able to complete her adjuvant chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel without further events. Her condition was neurologically stable without phenytoin for the next 6 months. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a possible association (score of 3) between the delayed seizure and paclitaxel or its solvent, Cremophor EL. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for seizure activity in patients who receive paclitaxel formulated with Cremophor EL.
Clozapine is effective for resistant schizophrenia. After two sudden deaths in physically well young men soon after starting clozapine, we investigated the cardiovascular complications for this drug.
From January, 1993, to March, 1999, 8000 patients started clozapine treatment in Australia, and were registered with a mandatory monitoring service. We identified cases of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy from voluntary reports to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Committee and sought details of the relevant diagnostic studies, necropsies that had been done in suspicious cases, or both.
23 cases (20 men, three women, mean age 36 years [SD 9]) were identified: 15 of myocarditis and eight of cardiomyopathy associated with clozapine treatment. Six patients died. All cases of myocarditis (five deaths) occurred within 3 weeks of starting clozapine. Cardiomyopathy (one death) was diagnosed up to 36 months after clozapine was started. Necropsy results showed mainly eosinophilic infiltrates with myocytolysis, consistent with an acute drug reaction.
Clozapine therapy may be associated with potentially fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy in physically healthy young adults with schizophrenia.
It is often difficult to administer extended antibiotic therapy in the hospital for right-sided Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Although the effectiveness of single-drug therapy given for 4 to 6 weeks and that of two-drug therapy given for 2 weeks have been shown, no data are available on the effectiveness of short-course single-drug therapy.
To compare the efficacy of cloxacillin alone with that of cloxacillin plus gentamicin for the 2-week treatment of right-sided S. aureus endocarditis in intravenous drug users.
Open, randomized study.
An academic tertiary care hospital in Barcelona, Spain.
90 consecutive intravenous drug users who had isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, had no allergy to study medications, and had no systemic infectious complications that required prolonged therapy. An efficacy subset consisted of 74 of these patients who did not meet an exclusion criterion.
Cloxacillin (2 g intravenously every 4 hours for 14 days) alone or combined with gentamicin (1 mg/kg of body weight intravenously every 8 hours for 7 days).
Clinical or microbiological evidence of active infection after 2 weeks of therapy, relapse of staphylococcal infection, or death.
In an analysis of the efficacy subset, treatment was successful in 34 of the 38 patients who received cloxacillin alone (89% [95% CI, 75% to 97%]) and 31 of the 36 patients who received cloxacillin plus gentamicin (86% [CI, 71% to 95%]). Three patients died: one in the cloxacillin group and two in the combination therapy group. Of the 37 patients who completed 2-week treatment with cloxacillin, 34 (92%) were cured, and 3 (8%) needed prolonged treatment to cure the infection. Of the 34 patients who completed 2-week treatment with cloxacillin plus gentamicin, 32 (94%) were cured and 2 (6%) required treatment for 4 weeks. One patient in the combination group had relapse.
A penicillinase-resistant penicillin used as single-agent therapy for 2 weeks was effective for most patients with isolated tricuspid endocarditis caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Adding gentamicin did not appear to provide any therapeutic advantages. Additional studies to confirm the therapeutic equivalence of short-course therapy with penicillinase-resistant penicillin alone and therapy with combined regimens are warranted.
Cystic maculopathy without leakage on fluorescein angiography has been described in cases of toxicity to niacin. We present a similar case of cystic maculopathy due to docetaxel (Taxotere) in the treatment of breast cancer.
A 53-year-old Asian female presented with complaints of decreased vision soon after the initiation of treatment for breast cancer with docetaxel. A cystic maculopathy with a normal fluorescein angiogram was found on examination. Significant improvement in visual acuity along with resolution of the cystic maculopathy was found after changing to an alternate antineoplastic agent.
Docetaxel may be associated with cystic maculopathy that does not display angiographic evidence of abnormal capillary permeability.
Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) reduces cell death in experimental and clinical liver dysfunction. Nitric oxide (NO) mediates PGE1 protection against D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced cell death. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) plays a protective role in different experimental models of cell death. We investigated if NF-kappaB was responsible for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and cytoprotection induced by PGE1 against D-GalN cell death in cultured hepatocytes. Rat hepatocytes were isolated following the classical method of collagenase perfusion of liver. A kinetic study of cell death, NF-kappaB activation, mRNA and protein iNOS expression, and NO production was carried in hepatocytes treated with D-GalN (5 mM) in the presence or absence of PGE1 (1 microM) administered 2 h before the hepatotoxin. A proteasome inhibitor was used to evaluate the role of NF-kappaB activation in our experimental conditions. PGE1 protection against D-GalN-induced cell death was associated with its capacity to rapidly enhance NF-kappaB activation, mRNA and protein iNOS expression, and NO production in D-GalN-treated hepatocytes. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation abolished iNOS expression and cell protection by PGE1 in hepatocytes treated with the hepatotoxin. The present study shows that the cytoprotection by PGE1 against D-GalN-induced apoptosis was related to NF-kappaB-dependent iNOS expression.
Lithium is known to potentiate the ability of pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus in rats. The goal of this study was to determine whether lithium could potentiate pilocarpine-induced seizures in developing animals. Behavioral, electroencephalographic (EEG), and histopathological changes induced by systemic administration of lithium (3 meq/kg) followed 20 h later by pilocarpine (3, 10, 30, 60 mg/kg) were studied in 3-30-day-old rats. Lithium followed by pilocarpine (30 and 60 mg/kg) induced hyperactivity, tremor, loss of postural control and scratching but no electrographic seizures in 3-8-day-old rats. In the 7-10-day-old animals pretreatment with lithium and pilocarpine 60 mg/kg induced status epilepticus with sustained myoclonus and continuous bilateral synchronous spike and sharp wave, but doses of pilocarpine lower than 60 mg/kg had no effect. The susceptibility to lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus increased markedly during the third postnatal week of life. During this time period, rats treated with lithium (3 meq/kg) plus pilocarpine 10 mg/kg exhibited behavioral and EEG manifestations of status epilepticus. The same combination of lithium and pilocarpine failed to induce status epilepticus either before or after the third week of life. Histopathological analysis of the brains of the animals used in these studies failed to demonstrate the widespread damage reported in adult rats that have undergone lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.
There is growing evidence of adverse birth outcomes due to exposure to air pollution during gestation. However, recent negative studies are also reported. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of ozone and vehicle exhaust exposure (NO(2)) on the length of the gestational period and risk of preterm delivery. We used data from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry on all vaginally delivered singleton births in the Greater Stockholm area who were conceived during 1987-1995 (n = 115,588). Daily average levels of NO(2) (from three measuring stations) and ozone (two stations) were used to estimate trimester and last week of gestation average exposures. Linear regression models were used to assess the association between the two air pollutants and three exposure windows, while logistic regression models were used when analyzing associations with preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation). Five percent were born preterm. The median gestational period was 40 weeks. Higher levels of ozone during the first trimester were associated with shorter gestation as well as with an elevated risk of preterm delivery, the odds ratio from the most complex model was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.00-1.13) per 10 μg/m(3) increase in the mean daily 8-h maximum concentration. Higher levels of ozone during the second trimester were associated with shorter gestation but the elevated risk of preterm delivery was not statistically significant. Higher levels of ozone and NO(2) during the last week of gestation were associated with a shorter duration of gestation and NO(2) also with preterm delivery. There were no significant associations between first and second trimester NO(2) exposure estimates and studied outcomes. The effect of first trimester ozone exposure, known to cause oxidative stress, was smallest among women who conceived during autumn when vitamin D status, important for fetal health, in Scandinavian women is the highest.
The pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in Parkinson's disease is not well understood. We have recorded local field potentials (LFP) from macroelectrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of 14 patients with Parkinson's disease following surgical treatment with deep brain stimulation. Patients were studied in the 'Off' medication state and in the 'On' motor state after administration of levodopa-carbidopa (po) or apomorphine (sc) that elicited dyskinesias in 11 patients. The logarithm of the power spectrum of the LFP in selected frequency bands (4-10, 11-30 and 60-80 Hz) was compared between the 'Off' and 'On' medication states. A peak in the 11-30 Hz band was recorded in the 'Off' medication state and reduced by 45.2% (P < 0.001) in the 'On' state. The 'On' was also associated with an increment of 77. 6% (P < 0.001) in the 4-10 Hz band in all patients who showed dyskinesias and of 17.8% (P < 0.001) in the 60-80 Hz band in the majority of patients. When dyskinesias were only present in one limb (n = 2), the 4-10 Hz peak was only recorded in the contralateral STN. These findings suggest that the 4-10 Hz oscillation is associated with the expression of LID in Parkinson's disease.
Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, and markers for disease subtypes and therapy response remain poorly defined. For that reason, we employed a retrospective study in node-positive breast cancer to identify molecular signatures of gene expression correlating with metastatic free survival. Patients were primarily included in FEC100 (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) arms of two multicentric prospective adjuvant clinical trials (PACS01 and PEGASE01-FNCLCC cooperative group). Data from nylon microarrays containing 8,032 cDNA unique sequences, representing 5,776 distinct genes, have been used to develop a predictive model for treatment outcome. We obtained the gene expression profiles for 150 of these patients, and used stringent univariate selection techniques based on Cox regression combined with principal component analysis to identify a genomic signature of metastatic relapse after adjuvant FEC100 regimen. Most of the 14 selected genes have a clear role in breast cancer, carcinogenesis or chemotherapy resistance. Six genes have been previously described in other genomic studies (UBE2C, CENPF, C16orf61 [DC13], STMN1, CCT5 and BCL2A1). Furthermore, we showed the interest of combining transcriptomic data with clinical data into a clinicogenomic model for patients subtyping. The described model adds predictive accuracy to that provided by the well-established Nottingham prognostic index or by our genomic signature alone.
