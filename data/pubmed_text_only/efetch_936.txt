The triazolopyridazine, CL218,872, inhibited the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in the cerebellum more potently than in cortex, both in vitro and in vivo. The relationship between this phenomenon and the selectivity of benzodiazepine receptor subtypes is considered. In a range of behavioural tests the overall profile of CL218,872 was similar to that of diazepam in the rat and mouse, although CL218,872 was half as potent as diazepam in the rat and some 20-fold weaker in the mouse. In particular contrast to published observations, CL218,872 reduced locomotor activity in rats and mice at doses only slightly larger than those required to inhibit conflict in rats and footshock-induced fighting in mice. The only qualitative difference between the compounds that could be detected was in the mouse where large doses of CL218,872 did not produce the marked degree of motor incoordination seen after diazepam. However, no such difference was observed in the rat. The presently held view that CL 218,872 is a non-sedative anxiolytic agent needs to be revised in the light of these observations.
Ischemia-reperfusion injury plays an important role in the development of primary allograft failure after heart transplantation. Inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for treating ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here we have characterized the cardioprotective efficacy of zoniporide and the underlying mechanisms in a model of myocardial preservation using rat isolated working hearts.
Rat isolated hearts subjected to 6 h hypothermic (1-4°C) storage followed by 45 min reperfusion at 37°C were treated with zoniporide at different concentrations and timing. Recovery of cardiac function, levels of total and phosphorylated protein kinase B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, glycogen synthase kinase-3β and STAT3 as well as cleaved caspase 3 were measured at the end of reperfusion. Lactate dehydrogenase release into coronary effluent before and post-storage was also measured.
Zoniporide concentration-dependently improved recovery of cardiac function after reperfusion. The functional recovery induced by zoniporide was accompanied by up-regulation of p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p-STAT3, and by reduction in lactate dehydrogenase release and cleaved caspase 3. There were no significant differences in any of the above indices when zoniporide was administered before, during or after ischemia. The STAT3 inhibitor, stattic, abolished zoniporide-induced improvements in functional recovery and up-regulation of p-STAT3 after reperfusion.
Zoniporide is a potent cardioprotective agent and activation of STAT3 plays a critical role in the cardioprotective action of zoniporide. This agent shows promise as a supplement to storage solutions to improve preservation of donor hearts.
Recent evidence has emerged that macrophage glutathione (GSH) content and selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGSHPx) activity are inversely related to cell-mediated oxidation of LDL, and intervention means to enhance the macrophage GSH-SeGSHPx status may contribute to attenuation of the atherosclerotic process. Our previous works showed that protein bound polysaccharide (PSK) injected intraperitoneally could enhance SeGSHPx activity and mRNA content of mouse macrophages. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate whether PSK can reduce the oxidative injury to the established atherosclerotic rabbits. Using the established atherosclerotic rabbit model, we studied the effect of PSK on oxidatively modified LDL (Ox-LDL), lipoperoxide (LPO) cholesterol contents and SeGSHPx activities of plasma and tissues (aorta, heart and liver) in the established atherosclerotic rabbits. As compared with the control group, Ox-LDL, LPO and cholesterol contents were much lower; SeGSHPx activities and SeGSHPx/LPO ratios were much higher in plasma and tissues (aorta, heart and liver); and the lesion area of aortae was reduced in the PSK group. Through the increment of SeGSHPx activity in macrophages and aortae, PSK enhances their antioxidation potentiality and improves the antioxidant/prooxidant imbalance in them, and thus decreases Ox-LDL, LPO and cholesterol contents of plasma and tissues, and regresses lesion area of aortae in the established atherosclerotic rabbits.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Previous studies have identified several genetic loci associated with typical AF. We sought to identify common genetic variants underlying lone AF. This condition affects a subset of individuals without overt heart disease and with an increased heritability of AF. We report a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies conducted using 1,335 individuals with lone AF (cases) and 12,844 unaffected individuals (referents). Cases were obtained from the German AF Network, Heart and Vascular Health Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cleveland Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital. We identified an association on chromosome 1q21 to lone AF (rs13376333, adjusted odds ratio = 1.56; P = 6.3 x 10(-12)), and we replicated this association in two independent cohorts with lone AF (overall combined odds ratio = 1.52, 95% CI 1.40-1.64; P = 1.83 x 10(-21)). rs13376333 is intronic to KCNN3, which encodes a potassium channel protein involved in atrial repolarization.
Cardiotoxicity limits the clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) and other quinone-hydroquinone antitumor anthracyclines. One-electron reduction of the quinone moiety is followed by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have been proposed to induce cardiotoxicity through an oxidative stress; conversely, one-electron oxidation of the hydroquinone moiety by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and oxyferrous myoglobin (Mb(II)O(2)) is followed by an anthracycline degradation process that has been proposed to limit cardiotoxicity. We previously reported that tert-butoxycarbonyl-alanine (t-BA) impeded DOX oxidation/degradation by H(2)O(2)/Mb(II)O(2) in a cell-free system; accordingly, t-BA increased the levels of DOX, its conversion to ROS, and its concentration-related toxicity in cardiomyocytes. To re-explore methodological and toxicological aspects of anthracycline degradation, we used 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI), an anthracycline analogue that is very similar to DOX but undergoes protonation-sequestration in cytoplasmic acidic organelles. t-BA lacked an effect on H9c2 cardiomyocytes exposed to EPI; however, blocking the protonation-sequestration mechanism with the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (BFL), enabled t-BA to increase the cellular levels of EPI, its conversion to ROS, and its concentration-related toxicity. This suggested that t-BA was specific enough to increase the cellular levels and toxicity of only those anthracyclines that were liable to oxidation/degradation by H(2)O(2)/Mb(II)O(2). By exposing cardiomyocytes to nontoxic concentrations of DOX or EPI and by increasing their cellular levels by means of appropriate combinations with t-BA, BFL, or t-BA+BFL, we nonetheless found that the loss of cardiomyocyte viability correlated with the accumulation of undegraded anthrayclines but not with their ability to form ROS or to induce lipid peroxidation. This suggested that an accumulation of undegraded anthracyclines might induce cardiotoxicity also by mechanisms independent of ROS and oxidative stress. Thus, EPI proved useful to refine the value of t-BA in the studies of anthracycline degradation and to reappraise the role of anthracycline degradation in cardiotoxicity.
Neoplastic nodules (NN) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) induced in the rat by ciprofibrate were analyzed for peroxisome proliferation. The volume density of peroxisomes in NN and HCC was 5.7 +/- 2.7 and 6.6 +/- 2.9, respectively; whereas in adjacent uninvolved liver the volume density was 16.3 +/- 5.0. No ultrastructural differences between NN were found to discriminate nodule from carcinoma. The results of this study indicate that the peroxisome proliferative response of NN and HCC to ciprofibrate is similar and can not be used as a marker to differentiate these lesions.
Chemopreventive potential of Acacia nilotica bark extract (ANBE) against single intraperitoneal injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA, 200mg/kg) followed by weekly subcutaneous injections of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4), 3 ml/kg) for 6 weeks induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats was studied. At 45 day after administration of NDEA, 100 and 200mg/kg of ANBE were administered orally once daily for 10 weeks. The levels of liver injury and liver cancer markers such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT), total bilirubin level (TBL), alpha-feto protein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were substantially increased following NDEA treatment. However, ANBE treatment reduced liver injury and restored liver cancer markers. ANBE also significantly prevented hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and reduced glutathione (GSH) in NDEA-treated rats which was dose dependent. Additionally, ANBE also increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes viz., catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the liver of NDEA-administered rats. Eventually, ANBE also significantly improved body weight and prevented increase of relative liver weight due to NDEA treatment. Histological observations of liver tissues too correlated with the biochemical observations. HPLC analysis of ANBE showed the presence of gallic, protocatechuic, caffeic and ellagic acids, and also quercetin in ANBE. The results strongly support that A. nilotica bark prevents lipid peroxidation (LPO) and promote the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense system during NDEA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis which might be due to activities like scavenging of oxy radicals by the phytomolecules in ANBE.
The haemodynamic effects of an infusion of nicardipine were studied noninvasively before, during and after halothane anaesthesia in man, using a simple technique to achieve constant plasma drug concentrations. Eighty patients were randomly allocated to receive an intravenous infusion of either nicardipine or normal saline. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were significantly lower and heart rate significantly higher throughout the infusion than before infusion (p less than 0.001, all variables) in those patients who received nicardipine. The hypotension induced by nicardipine was not affected by induction of anaesthesia; halothane significantly reduced the nicardipine-induced tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Nicardipine caused no cardiac rhythm disorders. This technique for the intravenous administration of nicardipine achieves appropriate stable plasma concentrations, is devoid of severe haemodynamic disturbance and appears to be safe to use during halothane anaesthesia in patients with normal left ventricular function.
We performed a genome-wide association study for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in three population cohorts, including 2,940 cases and 1,380 controls who were current or former smokers with normal lung function. We identified a new susceptibility locus at 4q22.1 in FAM13A and replicated this association in one case-control group (n = 1,006) and two family-based cohorts (n = 3,808) (rs7671167, combined P = 1.2 x 10(-11), combined odds ratio in case-control studies 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.69-0.83).
Although it has been shown that upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α is protective in acute ischemic renal injury, long-term overactivation of HIF-1α is implicated to be injurious in chronic kidney diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a well-known pathogenic factor producing chronic renal injury and has also been shown to increase HIF-1α. However, the contribution of HIF-1α to Ang II-induced renal injury has not been evidenced. The present study tested the hypothesis that HIF-1α mediates Ang II-induced renal injury in Sprague-Dawley rats. Chronic renal injury was induced by Ang II infusion (200 ng/kg per minute) for 2 weeks in uninephrectomized rats. Transfection of vectors expressing HIF-1α small hairpin RNA into the kidneys knocked down HIF-1α gene expression by 70%, blocked Ang II-induced HIF-1α activation, and significantly attenuated Ang II-induced albuminuria, which was accompanied by inhibition of Ang II-induced vascular endothelial growth factor, a known glomerular permeability factor, in glomeruli. HIF-1α small hairpin RNA also significantly improved the glomerular morphological damage induced by Ang II. Furthermore, HIF-1α small hairpin RNA blocked Ang II-induced upregulation of collagen and α-smooth muscle actin in tubulointerstitial region. There was no difference in creatinine clearance and Ang II-induced increase in blood pressure. HIF-1α small hairpin RNA had no effect on Ang II-induced reduction in renal blood flow and hypoxia in the kidneys. These data suggested that overactivation of HIF-1α-mediated gene regulation in the kidney is a pathogenic pathway mediating Ang II-induced chronic renal injuries, and normalization of overactivated HIF-1α may be used as a treatment strategy for chronic kidney damages associated with excessive Ang II.
Insulin resistance is one of the determinants of post-prandial hyperglycaemia. Recently, acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that delays the absorption of carbohydrates from the small intestine, has been found to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. However, the molecular mechanism by which acarbose inhibits cardiovascular events remains unknown. In this study, we examined whether oral administration of acarbose could suppress expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in fructose-fed rats, a widely used animal model of insulin resistance. Serum MCP-1 levels were elevated in fructose-fed rats after 4 weeks. Acarbose treatment for 4 weeks reduced the fructose-induced elevation of serum MCP-1 levels. Acarbose treatment for 8 weeks decreased MCP-1 mRNA levels in the aortae of fructose-fed rats. These results suggest that the cardioprotective effects of acarbose could be due, at least in part, to the suppression of MCP-1 expression.
Malignant hyperthermia is a life-threatening condition caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the ryanodine receptor type 1 gene. Identifying patients predisposed to malignant hyperthermia is done through the Ca-induced Ca release test in Japan. We examined the intracellular calcium concentration in human cultured muscle cells and compared the sensitivity of myotubes to ryanodine receptor type 1 activators based on the Ca-induced Ca release rate. We assessed the utility of this method as an identifying test for predisposition to malignant hyperthermia. Muscle specimens were obtained from 34 individuals undergoing the Ca-induced Ca release test. We cultured myotubes from residual material and monitored changes in intracellular calcium concentration after exposure to the ryanodine receptor type 1 activators caffeine, halothane and 4-chloro-m-cresol by measuring fura-2 fluorescence. We determined the half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) for the test compounds in each myotube and calculated cut-off points using receiver operating characteristic curves. Seventeen patients each were classified into the accelerated and non-accelerated groups based on their Ca-induced Ca release rate. The EC50 values for caffeine, halothane and 4-chloro-m-cresol of the accelerated group were significant lower than those of the non-accelerated group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The calculated cut-off points of EC50 values for caffeine, halothane and 4-CmC were 3.62 mM, 2.28 mM and 197 microM, respectively. An increased sensitivity to ryanodine receptor type 1 activators was seen in myotubes in the accelerated group. This functional test on human cultured myotubes indicates that the alteration of their intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis may identify the predisposition to malignant hyperthermia.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has shown concern about the burden of tuberculosis in the developing countries. Even though rifampicin is an effective drug in the management of tuberculosis, it has been documented to have some toxic effects in humans. Therefore, this study intends to investigate the modulatory effect of vitamins C and E on the hepatotoxicity, sperm quality and brain toxicity of Rifampicin. Forty Wistar albino rats were used, 10 animals per group. Group 1 animals received 0.3 mL of distilled water, the Group 2 animals received the therapeutic dose of rifampicin, Group 3 animals received therapeutic doses of rifampicin plus vitamin E, while Group 4 received therapeutic doses of rifampicin and vitamin C. The administration was performed orally during three months; the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the end of that period. Blood samples were collected and liver function and lipid profile was analyzed using fully automated clinical chemistry device. The liver, brain and reproductive organs underwent histopathological examination. Sperm samples were collected from the epididymis to achieve count and motility and morphological analysis. Results showed rifampicin alone to raise (p < 0.05) liver function enzymes (Aspartate amino transferase [AST], Serum alanine amino transferase [ALT] and Total Bilirubin) when compared with controls. While the vitamin E treated group showed remarkable protection, the vitamin C treated group showed questionable protection against the rifampicin induced liver damage. Sperm count results showed an important (p < 0.05) increase in the sperm quality in vitamin E and C treated groups. However, the vitamin E plus Rifampicin treated group showed increased lipid peroxidation. The histopathological findings revealed structural damages by rifampicin in liver, brain and epididymis while some remarkable architectural integrity was observed in the antioxidant-treated groups. It can be concluded that vitamin E or C improved sperm quality and protected against the brain damage caused by rifampicin. Moreover, vitamin E demonstrated remarkable hepatoprotection against rifampicin induced damage while vitamin C shows a questionable hepatoprotection.
To study the effect of resveratrol on spermatogenesis after 2,5-hexanedione(2,5-HD)-induced testicular injury.
Forty male SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups. Group A were normally raised and Group B, C, D and E exposed to 1% 2,5-HD for 5 weeks, followed by administration of resveratrol of different concentrations (20, 40 and 80 mg/[ kg x d], respectively) to Group C, D and E for 9 weeks. Then the rats were killed, their physical signs, body weight gain and testis weight were assessed, and immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis used to investigate the numbers and diameters of seminiferous tubules and the expression of c-kit protein of spermatogenic cell membrane.
The rats exposed to 2,5-HD showed weak body, lax skin, dim color pattern, tardy body weight gain, and emaciated testis. Immunohistochemistry revealed emaciated seminiferous tubules, stagnant obsolete spermatogonia and negative expression of c-kit protein. After resveratrol administration, the 2,5-HD-induced physical signs were improved and close to normal. Compared with those of the 2,5-HD injured group, the body weight and testis weight of the resveratrol treated group increased obviously (P < 0.01); and the aliquots of the seminiferous epithelia began to differentiate and the spermatogenesis and expression of c-kit protein partly resumed (P < 0.01). With increasing dose of resveratrol, the diameters and numbers of seminiferous tubules (P < 0.01) and the expression levels of c-kit protein (P < 0.01) were gradually and significantly restored almost to normal.
Resveratrol could promote the recovery of spermatogenesis after 2,5-HD-induced testicular injury.
To compare the frequency, severity, and time course of venous irritation after administration of a single intravenous dose of phenytoin with an equimolar dose of fosphenytoin, a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug.
Randomized, double-blind, two-period, crossover study.
University hospital clinical research unit.
Twelve healthy volunteers within 15% of ideal body weight and with no clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination, medical history, or laboratory assessment.
Volunteers randomly received a 30-minute infusion of phenytoin sodium 250 mg (250 mg/5 ml) or an equimolar dose of fosphenytoin 375 mg (375 mg/5 ml). Subjects returned for the crossover treatment 14-21 days later.
Subjects assessed venous irritation (pain, burning, itching), and investigators evaluated phlebitis (erythema, swelling, tenderness), induration, exudation, and cording. Phenytoin was associated with a significantly higher degree of pain at the infusion site in all subjects and a significant degree of phlebitis in eight subjects (p < 0.05); cording occurred in six subjects. The time course of phenytoin-induced phlebitis was bimodal. Erythema and tenderness were prominent at the end of the infusion and again at 24 hours. Cording was first noted between 24 hours and 1 week after infusion. In contrast, fosphenytoin was associated with mild pain in two subjects, one incident of phlebitis, and no erythema or cording.
Fosphenytoin administration resulted in significantly less venous irritation and phlebitis compared with an equimolar dose of phenytoin. The clinical use of this water-soluble phenytoin prodrug should minimize the frequency and severity of infusion-site reactions and should allow convenient, rapid, intravenous administration of drug, undiluted or admixed with intravenous solutions.
We studied nine presumed nongenotoxic rodent carcinogens, as defined by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), to determine their ability to induce acute or subacute biochemical and tissue changes that may act as useful predictors of nongenotoxic rodent carcinogenesis. The chemicals selected included six liver carcinogens (two of which are peroxisome proliferators), three thyroid gland carcinogens, and four kidney carcinogens. We administered the chemicals (diethylhexyl phthalate, cinnamyl anthranilate, chlorendic acid, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, monuron, ethylene thiourea, diethyl thiourea, trimethyl thiourea, and d-limonene to the same strains of mice and rats used in the original NTP bioassays (nine chemicals to rats and seven to mice). Selected tissues (liver, thyroid gland, and kidney) were collected from groups of animals at 7, 28, and 90 days for evaluation. Tissue changes selected for study were monitored for all of the test groups, irrespective of the specificity of the carcinogenic responses observed in those tissues. This allowed us to assess both the carcinogen specificity and the carcinogen sensitivity of the events being monitored. We studied relative weight, cell labeling indices, and pathologic changes such as hypertrophy in all tissues; a range of cytochrome P450 enzymes and palmitoyl coenzyme A oxidase in the liver; changes in the levels of plasma total triiodothyronine, total thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as markers of thyroid gland function; and hyaline droplet formation, tubular basophilia, and the formation of granular casts in the kidney. There were no single measurements that alerted specifically to the carcinogenicity of the agents to the rodent liver, thyroid gland, or kidney. However, in the majority of cases, the chemical induction of cancer in a tissue was preceded by a range of biochemical/morphologic changes, most of which were moderately specific for a carcinogenic outcome, and some of which were highly specific for it (e.g., increases in TSH in the thyroid gland and increases in relative liver weight in the mouse). The only measurements that failed to correlate usefully with carcinogenicity were the induction of liver enzymes (with the exception of the enzymes associated with peroxisome proliferation). Most of the useful markers were evident at the early times studied (7 days and 28 days), but no overall best time for the measurement of all markers was identified. The judicious choice of markers and evaluation times can aid the detection of potential nongenotoxic rodent carcinogens.
A 67-year-old lady was admitted with a myocardial infarction. Coronarography revealed thrombotic material within coronary arteries. The underlying disease was paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a stem cell defect characterized by episodes of complement-induced hemolysis and thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation and antiaggregation were initiated. Subsequently, massive cerebral bleeding developed, to which the patient finally succumbed despite neurosurgical craniectomy. This tragic case illustrates that an antithrombotic treatment is always a balancing act with an unsecure outcome.
It has been well characterized that flavonoids possess pronounced anticancer potentials including anti-angiogenesis, anti-metastasis, and pro-apoptosis. Herein, we report, for the first time, that VI-14, a novel flavonoid derivative, possesses anti-cancer properties. The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-migration and anti-invasion activities of VI-14 in breast cancer cells. Our data indicate that VI-14 inhibits adhesion, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 cells treated with VI-14 display reduced activities and expressions of ECM degradation-associated proteins including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and 9 (MMP-9) at both the protein and mRNA levels. Meanwhile, VI-14 treatment induces an up-regulated expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) and 2 (TIMP-2) in MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blotting results show that phosphorylation levels of critical components of the MAPK signaling pathway, including ERK, JNK and P38, are dramatically decreased in VI-14-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, treatment of VI-14 significantly decreases the nuclear levels and the binding ability of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Taken together, our data suggest that VI-14 treatment suppresses migration and motility of breast cancer cells, and VI-14 may be a potential compound for cancer therapy.
A case is reported in which a patient became manic while taking metoclopramide, a drug which affects several neurotransmitter systems. The apparent relationship between the manic symptoms and metoclopramide was strengthened by a placebo period with no such symptoms, followed by recurrence upon rechallenge. Amitriptyline blunted the manic response.
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta along with decreased striatal dopamine levels, and consequent extra pyramidal motor dysfunctions occur. It has been reported that Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic recently had shown to have neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative disorder. Therefore the present study was designed to investigate the effects of Ceftriaxone (CFX) in a MPTP model of Parkinson in rats. MPTP was administered intranigrally for the induction of PD in Male Wistar rats. Ceftriaxone (100 and 200mg/kg) and Ropinirole (1.5 and 3mg/kg) were given intraperitonially, after induction of Parkinson's disease for 14 days. Different behavioral performance was carried on 1st, 14th, 21st, 28th consecutive days and biochemical parameters were estimated on 28th day. Central administration of MPTP showed significant impairment of motor behavior and marked increase of oxidative damage and neuro-inflammmation in rats. However, post treatment with Ceftriaxone (100 and 200mg/kg) significantly improved the motor deficits and attenuated the oxidative damage indicating decreased rise of LPO and nitrite concentration and restored the decreased activities of endogenous antioxidant enzyme (Glutathione, Catalase, SOD). In addition Ceftriaxone also attenuates the pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-β in striatum region of MPTP induced PD in rats. Ropinirole (1.5mg/kg) pretreatment with sub-effective dose of a Ceftriaxone (100mg/kg) had significantly enhanced the protective effect of Ceftriaxone as compare to its effect with per se group. These results suggested that Ceftriaxone exhibit Neuroprotective effect by mediating brain antioxidant defense mechanism and by up regulating of dopaminergic pathway and down regulation of glutamatergic pathway.
The development of acute renal failure and interstitial nephritis due to therapeutic doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been documented repeatedly in adult patients but is rare in children. We report the occurrence of this complication in a child. Acute renal failure and hyperkalemia developed in a 2-year-old boy with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis after one month of naproxen sodium therapy. The evidence of renal toxic effects became manifest after an episode of dehydration. A percutaneous renal biopsy specimen revealed interstitial nephritis. The patient recovered promptly after withdrawal of the drug.
Behavioural and some neurochemical effects of Ro 40-7592 (3,4-dihydroxy-4'-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone), a new COMT inhibitor, were studied in rats and mice. Ro 40-7592 increased the effect of L-DOPA (plus benserazide) on locomotor activity, reserpine-induced hypothermia, and catalepsy induced by pimozide, haloperidol and fluphenazine. Locomotor hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or nomifensine, as well as stereotypy induced by amphetamine (but not apomorphine), were also increased by Ro 40-7592. The drug stimulated exploratory activity in the open field test. It decreased the levels of HVA and 3-MT, increased the level of DOPAC but did not change the levels of dopamine in the striatum, nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex. These results indicate that Ro 40-7592 may improve the therapy with L-DOPA (plus decarboxylase inhibitor) of Parkinson's disease.
The authors report a case of thrombopenia induced by pentosane polysulfate (PSP), complicated by a myocardial infarction. Biological tests showed a platelet pro-aggregating effect of PSP and an IgG immunoglobulin fixed to the platelets. A review of the literature shows that PSP-induced thrombopenias must be known as well as those induced by heparins and that they have similar complications. The thrombopenia may persist with an inappropriate substitution with heparin and the clinical picture may be aggravated. It is desirable to carry out systematic screening for a cross-allergy and prevent it by using anti-vitamin K.
Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) has been described as a phenobarbital-like inducer of hepatic enzymes. Phenobarbital (PB) and phenobarbital-like chemicals induce transient hepatic and thyroid hyperplasia and sustained hypertrophy in rats and mice. The extent to which these processes are involved with D4-induced hepatomegaly is not known. The present study has evaluated the effects of repeated inhalation exposure to D4 vapors on hepatic and thyroid cell proliferation and hypertrophy with respect to time and exposure concentration. Female Fischer 344 rats were exposed via whole body inhalation to 0 ppm D4, 700 ppm D4 vapors (6 h/day; 5 days/week), or 0.05% PB in drinking water over a 4-week period. Incorporation of 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and the abundance of proliferating cell nuclear antigen were used as indicators of cell proliferation. Designated animals from each treatment group were euthanized on study days 6, 13, and 27. The effect of D4 exposure concentration on hepatic cell proliferation was evaluated at 0, 7, 30, 70, 150, 300, or 700 ppm. Liver-to-body weight ratios in animals exposed to 700 ppm D4 were increased 18, 20, and 22% over controls while PB-treated animals showed increases of 33, 27, and 27% over controls on days 6, 13, and 27 respectively. Hepatic incorporation of BrdU following exposure to D4 was highest on day 6 (labeling index = 15-22%) and was at or below control values by day 27. This pattern of transient hyperplasia was observed in all hepatic lobes examined and was similar to the pattern observed following treatment with PB.
