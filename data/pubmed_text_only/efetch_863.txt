Elocalcitol, which had been under development by BioXell SpA, is a synthetic derivative of vitamin D3 that regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis via its binding to the vitamin D receptor. In preclinical studies, elocalcitol inhibited the androgen-dependent and androgen-independent proliferation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cells more potently than finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor. In a phase IIb trial in patients with BPH, treatment with elocalcitol resulted in a significantly reduced prostate volume compared with placebo; irritative urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency and nocturia) and urodynamic parameters were comparable to the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin. In a phase IIa trial in patients with prostatitis, elocalcitol significantly reduced levels of IL-8 in semen, suggesting improved quality and forward motility of sperm. However, phase IIb trial data from patients with overactive bladder (OAB) were less promising: elocalcitol failed to meet the primary endpoint despite demonstrating good efficacy in a phase IIa trial. Based largely on these disappointing data, BioXell decided to terminate all further clinical development of elocalcitol, including an uncompleted phase IIa trial in patients with male infertility. Given the novel mechanism of action, efficacy profile and improved tolerability of elocalcitol over existing classes of drugs, the compound could have potentially added to the armamentarium in the expanding therapeutic markets of BPH, OAB and male infertility. This possibility appears to have been negated by BioXell's recent decision to terminate all further development of elocalcitol.
Antioxidant properties of many medicinal plants have been widely recognized and some of them have been commercially exploited. Plant derived antioxidants play a very important role in alleviating problems related to oxidative stress. The present study was aimed at assessing the antioxidant property of costunolide and eremanthin isolated from a medicinal plant Costus speciosus (Koen ex. Retz) Sm. rhizome. Experimental diabetes was induced by a single dose of STZ (60mg/kg, i.p.) injection. The oxidative stress was measured by tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH) content and enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in brain, liver, heart, kidney and pancreas. An increase in TBARS level, a significant reduction in GSH content along with decreased enzymatic activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx were seen in untreated diabetic rats. Administration of either costunolide (20mg/kg day) or eremanthin (20mg/kg day) for 60 days caused a significant reduction in TBARS level and a significant increase in GSH content along with increased enzymatic activities of SOD, CAT and GPx in the treated rats when compared to untreated diabetic rats. Acute toxicity test revealed the non-toxic nature of the compounds. The results indicated for the first time the protective effect of costunolide and eremanthin from oxidative stress, thus opening the way for their use in medication.
During the clinical development of nomifensine maleate (Merital), 1319 depressed patients received nomifensine (average doses of 150 mg/day) in 4-6 week trials; treatment was continued for at least 2 months in 170 patients and at least 6 months in 53. Comparison data were provided by 593 patients who received placebo and 612 given the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine HCl (average doses of 150 mg/day). The relationship of therapeutic gain to interfering side effects (the therapeutic index) was rated by the investigators and nomifensine received a more favorable therapeutic index rating than did imipramine. Side effect information was collected at each visit. Nomifensine produced less sedating, anticholinergic, and other discomforting side effects than imipramine and was able to sustain clinical benefit with minimal side effects in patients treated up to 6 months.
A 7-month-old male presented with lethargy and failure to thrive. The child was exclusively breast-fed from birth by a mother who was a strict vegetarian. Laboratory data revealed macrocytic anemia and methylmalonic acid in the urine, consistent with vitamin B12 deficient anemia. The patient responded well to supplementation with B12 alone and was developmentally normal by 11 months of age. This study emphasizes the need for assuring maternal dietary adequacy during pregnancy and after birth.
E75 and GP2 are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-restricted immunogenic peptides derived from the HER2/neu protein. In a E75 peptide-based vaccine trial, preexisting immunity and epitope spreading to GP2 was detected. The purpose of this study was to further investigate GP2 for potential use in vaccination strategies. Importantly, a naturally occurring polymorphism (I-->V at position 2, 2VGP2) associated with increased breast cancer risk was addressed.
Prevaccination peripheral blood samples (PBMC) from HLA-A2 breast cancer patients and CD8+ T cells from HLA-A2 healthy donors were stimulated with autologous dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with GP2 and tested in standard cytotoxicity assays with HER2/neu+ tumor cells or GP2- or 2VGP2-loaded T2 targets. Additional cytotoxicity experiments used effectors stimulated with DC pulsed with E75, GP2, or the combination of E75+GP2.
GP2-stimulated prevaccination PBMC from 28 patients demonstrated killing of MCF-7, SKOV3-A2, and the HLA-A2- control target SKOV3 of 28.8+/-3.7% (P<.01), 29.5+/-4.0% (P<.01), and 16.9+/-2.7%, respectively. When compared with E75, GP2-stimulated CD8+ T cells lysed HER2/neu+ targets at 43.8+/-5.2% versus 44.2+/-5.7% for E75 (P=.87). When combined, an additive effect was noted with 58.6+/-5.4% lysis (P=.05). GP2-stimulated CD8+ T cells specifically recognized both GP2-loaded (19.6+/-5.7%) and 2VGP2-loaded T2 targets (17.7+/-5.2%).
GP2 is a clinically relevant HER2/neu-derived peptide with immunogenicity comparable to that of E75. Importantly, GP2-specific effectors recognize 2VGP2-expressing targets; therefore, a GP2 vaccine should be effective in patients carrying this polymorphism. GP2 may be most beneficial used in a multiepitope vaccine.
Injected intramuscularly, the enanthane and decanoate esters of the phenothiazine fluphenazine are an effective treatment of the disordered behavior and thinking of schizophrenia. The decanoate preparation is not only slightly longer-acting but also has a smaller incidence of side-effects that the enanthate. The major adverse effect of these medications is the high frequency of extrapyramidal system disturbance. Since the 50% rate of failure of schizophrenic outpatients to take prescribed oral medications decreases treatment failure to about 20% with the use of long-acting injectable phenothiazines, this route of administration offers an advantage in patient management particularly applicable to community mental health systems. Moreover, parenteral administration of long-acting fluphenazine may be useful for patients who do not attain effective serum levels with medication taken orally because of metabolic or absorption difficulties.
A once-weekly regimen of streptomycin (1 g) plus a slow-release preparation of isoniazid (matrix isoniazid) in high dosage, namely 50 mg/kg body-weight for rapid inactivators of isoniazid and 35 mg/kg for slow inactivators, was prescribed for 6 months to 64 tuberculous patients (27 rapid, 37 slow). The regimen was tolerated by most the of the patients. However, 4 rapid and 3 slow inactivators had a modification of the regimen, mainly for giddiness. There were no cases of peripheral neuropathy. No adverse effects on haemopoiesis or hepatic or renal functions were observed in any of the patients. It is concluded that it is feasible to administer matrix isoniazid in dosages considerably higher than ordinary isoniazid, in once-weekly chemotherapy.
Enhanced behavioral responsiveness to central nervous system (CNS) norepinephrine (NE) in Alzheimer disease (AD) may contribute to the pathophysiology of disruptive behaviors such as aggression, uncooperativeness with necessary care, irritability, and pressured pacing. We evaluated the efficacy of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol for treatment-resistant disruptive behaviors and overall behavioral status in nursing home residents with probable or possible AD.
Thirty-one subjects (age 85 +/- 8 [SD]) with probable or possible AD and persistent disruptive behaviors that interfered with necessary care were randomized to propranolol (n = 17) or placebo (n = 14) in a double-blind study. Stable doses of previously prescribed psychotropics were maintained at pre-study dose during the study. Following a propranolol or placebo dose titration period of up to 9 days (per a dosing algorithm), subjects were maintained on maximum achieved dose for 6 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC).
Propranolol augmentation (mean achieved dose 106 +/- 38 mg/d) was significantly more effective than placebo for improving overall behavioral status on the total NPI score and CGIC. Improvement in individual NPI items within propranolol subjects was significant only for "agitation/aggression" and "anxiety," and reached borderline statistical significance favoring propranolol over placebo only for "agitation/aggression." Pressured pacing and irritability did not appear responsive to propranolol. In propranolol subjects rated "moderately improved" or "markedly improved" on the CGIC at the end of the double-blind study phase, improvement of overall behavioral status had diminished substantially after 6 months of open-label propranolol treatment.
Short-term propranolol augmentation treatment appeared modestly effective and well tolerated for overall behavioral status in nursing home residents with probable or possible AD complicated by disruptive behaviors. Propranolol may be helpful specifically for aggression and uncooperativeness (the behaviors assessed by the NPI "agitation/aggressiveness" item). However, the usefulness of propranolol in this very old and frail population was limited by the high frequency of relative contraindications to beta-adrenergic antagonist treatment and diminution of initial behavioral improvements over time.
Uric acid nephrolithiasis developed in a 75-year-old man who had received a large cumulative dose of streptozotocin for treatment of metastatic islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Oligoanuric renal failure mediated by massive intraureteral uric acid deposits occurred despite normal serum concentrations of uric acid. This case implicates the uricosuric effects of streptozotocin in the pathogenesis of uric acid nephropathy and suggests that renal uric acid excretion should be monitored routinely in patients receiving large cumulative doses of this drug.
Initial results from the first International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS-I) found that tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors by 31% in women at increased risk for breast cancer, but most of the follow-up at this time was during the active treatment phase. We report an updated analysis of IBIS-I that focuses on the period after active treatment was completed, a time for which little evidence from other trials is available.
A total of 7145 women who were aged 35-70 years and at increased risk of breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either tamoxifen (20 mg/day) or placebo for 5 years. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma in situ), but side effects were also investigated. Relative risks were computed as the ratio of incidence rates. All statistical tests were two-sided.
After a median follow-up of 96 months after randomization, 142 breast cancers were diagnosed in the 3579 women in the tamoxifen group and 195 in the 3575 women in the placebo group (4.97 versus 6.82 per 1000 woman-years, respectively; risk ratio [RR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58 to 0.91, P = .004). The prophylactic effect of tamoxifen was fairly constant for the entire follow-up period, and no diminution of benefit was observed for up to 10 years after randomization. However, side effects in the tamoxifen group were much lower after completion of the active treatment period than during active treatment. For example, deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were statistically significantly higher in the tamoxifen arm than in the placebo arm during active treatment (52 versus 23 cases, RR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.36 to 3.87) but not after tamoxifen was stopped (16 versus 14 cases, RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.52 to 2.53). The two arms did not differ in the risk of ER-negative invasive tumors (35 in each arm, RR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.65) across the entire follow-up period, but the risk of ER-positive invasive breast cancer was 34% lower in the tamoxifen arm (87 versus 132 cases, RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.87).
The risk-reducing effect of tamoxifen appears to persist for at least 10 years, but most side effects of tamoxifen do not continue after the 5-year treatment period.
Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common cause of hospital-acquired renal failure. Gadolinium-based contrast agents have been proposed as alternatives to iodinated contrast in patients at high risk for CIN. The use of high-dose intraarterial gadolinium chelates in the catheterization laboratory has been investigated in only a small number of patients. We compared patients with a creatinine clearance <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 who received intravenous hydration (> or =1,500 ml) and oral n-acetylcysteine prophylaxis with those who received a gadodiamide-iodine mixture (n = 90) or iodinated contrast alone (n = 79) in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. CIN was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dl in serum creatine from baseline. The 2 groups were similar with respect to demographics and risk factors. Although less iodinated contrast was used in the gadolinium mixture group, there was no difference in the incidence of CIN between the 2 groups. However, the initiation of dialysis (n = 7) and death (n = 8) only occurred in the diluted gadolinium contrast group. A stepdown multivariate analysis found diabetes mellitus to be the only independent predictor of CIN (p = 0.02, odds ratio 3.35, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 9.29, c-statistic 0.66). In conclusion, the incidence of CIN was not decreased in high-risk patients receiving a gadolinium-iodinated contrast mixture versus iodinated contrast alone.
Triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI; D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.1) deficiency is a recessive disorder that results in hemolytic anemia and neuromuscular dysfunction. To determine the molecular basis of this disorder, a TPI allele from two unrelated patients homozygous for TPI deficiency was compared with an allele from a normal individual. Each disease-associated sequence harbors a G X C----C X G transversion in the codon for amino acid-104 and specifies a structurally altered protein in which a glutamate residue is replaced by an aspartate residue. The importance of glutamate-104 to enzyme structure and function is implicated by its conservation in the TPI protein of all species that have been characterized to date. The glutamate-to-aspartate substitution results in a thermolabile enzyme as demonstrated by assays of TPI activity in cultured fibroblasts of each patient and cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were stably transformed with the mutant alleles. Although this substitution conserves the overall charge of amino acid-104, the x-ray crystal structure of chicken TPI indicates that the loss of a side-chain methylene group (-CH2CH2COO- ---- -CH2COO-) is sufficient to disrupt the counterbalancing of charges that normally exists within a hydrophobic pocket of the native enzyme.
Bisphosphonates exhibit direct antitumor activity in animal models, but only at high doses that are incompatible with the clinical dosing regimens approved for the treatment of cancer patients with skeletal metastases. We compared the antitumor effects of clinical dosing regimens of the bisphosphonates zoledronic acid and clodronate in a mouse model of bone metastasis.
Mice (n = 6-10 per group) were treated with zoledronic acid, clodronate, or vehicle starting before (preventive protocols) or after (treatment protocols) intravenous injection with human B02/GFP.2 breast cancer cells, which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase and metastasize to bone. Zoledronic acid was given as daily, weekly, or single doses at a cumulative dose of 98-100 microg/kg body weight, equivalent to the 4-mg intravenous dose given to patients. Clodronate was given as a daily dose (530 microg/kg/day), equivalent to the daily 1600-mg oral clinical dose given to patients. Bone destruction was measured by radiography, x-ray absorptiometry or tomography, and histomorphometry (as the ratio of bone volume to tissue volume). Skeletal tumor burden was measured by histomorphometry (as the ratio of tumor burden to soft tissue volume [TB/STV]) and luciferase activity. All statistical tests were two-sided.
In treatment protocols, daily clodronate was less effective at decreasing the TB/STV ratio than daily (53% versus 87%, difference = 34%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 16% to 44%, P < .001) or weekly (53% versus 90%, difference = 37%, 95% CI = 19% to 46%, P < .001) zoledronic acid-dosing regimens. Compared with vehicle, a single dose of zoledronic acid decreased tumor burden by only 16% (95% CI = 9% to 22%, P < .001). In preventive protocols, daily clodronate and daily or weekly zoledronic acid decreased the TB/STV ratio by 49% (95% CI = 40% to 57%, P = .006), 83% (95% CI = 68% to 98%, P < .001), and 66% (95% CI = 47% to 84%, P < .001), respectively, compared with vehicle, whereas a single dose of zoledronic acid decreased tumor burden by only 13% (95% CI = -2% to 28%, P = .84). Mice treated with a daily preventive regimen of clodronate or with a daily or weekly preventive regimen of zoledronic acid showed a decreased B02/GFP.2 cell tumor burden compared with vehicle, whereas a single preventive dose of zoledronic acid had no effect.
Daily or repeated intermittent therapy with clinical doses of bisphosphonates inhibits skeletal tumor growth in a mouse model.
We tried to identify a novel marker characteristic for rat hepatocellular preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, undetectable by well established cytochemical markers. Glutathione S-transferase placental (GST-P)-negative hepatocellular altered foci (HAF), hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were generated by two initiation-promotion models with N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEN) and peroxisome proliferators, Wy-14,643 and clofibrate. Total RNAs isolated from laser-microdissected GST-P-negative HAF (amphophilic cell foci) and adjacent normal tissues were applied to microarray analysis. As a result, five up-regulated genes were identified, and further detailed examinations of the gene demonstrating most fluctuation, ie, that for alpha(2)-macroglobulin (alpha(2)M) were performed. In reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, alpha(2)M mRNA was overexpressed not only in amphophilic GST-P-negative HAF but also in amphophilic GST-P-negative HCA and HCC. In situ hybridization showed accumulation of alpha(2)M mRNA to be evenly distributed within GST-P-negative HAF (predominantly amphophilic cell foci). Distinctive immunohistochemical staining for alpha(2)M could be consistently demonstrated in GST-P-negative HAF, HCA, and HCC induced not only by peroxisome proliferators but also N-nitrosodiethylamine alone. Thus our findings suggest that alpha(2)M is an important novel cytochemical marker to identify hepatocellular preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, particularly amphophilic cell foci, undetectable by established cytochemical markers and is tightly linked to rat hepatocarcinogenesis.
In a double-blind random assignment study, nomifensine was compared to imipramine in a population of depressed male inpatients (N = 36; ages 22-56 years). Nomifensine and imipramine in doses of 100-150 mg/day were found to be comparable over the 4-week treatment period on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impressions. The Self-Rating Symptom Scale showed differences favoring nomifensine for the Depression factor at Days 3, 7, and 10. In extensive laboratory analyses, no clinically important changes were seen within or between groups. Although differences were not significant, more discomforting side effects--specifically, anticholinergic, nervousness/restlessness, and sedation--were seen in the imipramine than the nomifensine group. These results indicate that nomifensine compares favorably with imipramine in the treatment of depressed inpatients.
Chemoimmunotherapy for patients with metastatic melanoma is associated with high toxicity, and only a subset of patients will benefit. This randomised phase II study was performed with the primary objective of exploring whether two cycles of dacarbazine monotherapy could select the subset of patients that would benefit most from more intensive chemoimmunotherapy.
Patients with metastatic melanoma were randomised to either receive chemoimmunotherapy with dacarbazine, cisplatin, interferon-alpha and interleukin-2 (arm A) or initial treatment with two cycles of dacarbazine monotherapy followed irrespective of response by the same 4-drug regimen of chemoimmunotherapy (arm B). Chemoimmunotherapy was continued in the absence of disease progression for a maximum of four cycles. Primary end-point was the disease stabilisation rate.
A total of 93 patients were randomised, and 89 patients were eligible. Disease stabilisation (complete/partial response or stable disease) was achieved in 19 patients (42.2%) in arm A and 9 patients (20.5%) in arm B. In arm B 32 of the 44 patients continued chemoimmunotherapy after two cycles of dacarbazine. Of 20 patients with progressive disease (PD) after two cycles of dacarbazine in arm B, only 2 patients achieved an objective response. Median overall survival (OS) in arms A and B was 10.5 months and 9.5 months, respectively.
Despite a lower initial stabilisation rate, the strategy of starting with 2 courses of DTIC prior to a 4-drug regimen led to comparable median overall survival. Only few transient responses were achieved with the 4-drug regimen in patients with disease progression on DTIC, suggesting frequent cross resistance. Two cycles of dacarbazine monotherapy cannot be recommended to select patients for more intensive chemoimmunotherapy.
The anticonvulsive effect of midazolam was compared with that of diazepam in ten dogs. Lidocaine-induced seizure waves on the electroencephalogram were used to observe the suppressive effect of the drugs. Midazolam, 0.2 mg.kg(-1), was found to possess a stronger suppressive effect against lidocaine-induced seizures than the same dose of diazepam. These two drugs showed to possess similar effects on cerebral and systemic circulations and cerebral metabolism during seizures.
Amiodarone (AD) is a highly efficient antiarrhythmic drug with potentially serious side effects. Severe pulmonary toxicity is reported in patients receiving AD even at low doses and may cause interstitial pneumonia as well as lung fibrosis. Apoptosis of alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) has been suggested to play an important role in this disease. In the current study, we aimed to establish a murine model of AD-induced lung fibrosis and analyze surfactant homeostasis, lysosomal, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in this model. AD/vehicle was instilled intratracheally into C57BL/6 mice, which were sacrificed on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Extent of lung fibrosis development was assessed by trichrome staining and hydroxyproline measurement. Cytotoxicity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase assay. Phospholipids (PLs) were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Surfactant proteins (SP) and markers for apoptosis, lysosomal, and ER stress were studied by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. AECII morphology was evaluated by electron microscopy. Extensive lung fibrosis and AECII hyperplasia were observed in AD-treated mice already at day 7. Surfactant PL and SP accumulated in AECII over time. In parallel, induction of apoptosis, lysosomal, and ER stress was encountered in AECII of mice lungs and in MLE12 cells treated with AD. In vitro, siRNA-mediated knockdown of cathepsin D did not alter the AD-induced apoptotic response. Our data suggest that mice exposed to intratracheal AD develop severe pulmonary fibrosis, exhibit extensive surfactant alterations and cellular stress, but AD-induced AECII apoptosis is not mediated primarily via cathepsin D.
We encountered a case of exercise-induced chest pain after the implantation of sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs). She had no history of previous chest pain, and an exercise stress test just after the implantation of the SESs was negative without any symptoms. However, six months after the implantation of the SESs, she began to experience frequent episodes of severe chest pain on effort in spite of there being no significant coronary stenosis. Interestingly, severe coronary vasoconstriction was induced by an intracoronary administration of acetylcholine, and exercise stress testing revealed positive findings with chest pain and ST-T segment depression on ECG. An intensive treatment with two types of calcium channel blockers could readily and completely abolish the exercise-induced chest pain and ST-T segment depression on the ECG. In view of these findings, we presumed that coronary microvessel dysfunction and/or exercise-induced coronary vasoconstriction leading to myocardial ischemia had appeared 6 months after the implantation of the SESs. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon could not be completely elucidated, the anatomical and functional abnormalities of the coronary arteries associated with the implantation of the SESs may have been one of the most important mechanisms.
A 61-year-old woman fell ill with recurrent nausea, loss of appetite and tiredness. Five days later she noted increasing jaundice of skin and sclerae, pale stools and dark urine, and she developed itching over the whole body. Among biochemical tests alkaline phosphatase (537 U/l) and bilirubin (32.0 mg/dl) were markedly increased, while both GOT (102 U/l) and GPT (39 U/l) were only slightly elevated. Ultrasonography was normal and extrahepatic cholestasis appeared unlikely on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Cholestasis due to virus hepatitis was also excluded. It was only on repeated and direct questioning that the patient reported having taken three tablets daily of Augmentin (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) for 12 days 5 weeks before the onset of symptoms.
After symptomatic treatment with Colestyramine (4 g three times daily), ursodeoxycholic acid (250 mg twice daily) and the antihistaminic Clemastine (1 g two times daily) the severe pruritus decreased quickly and alkaline phosphatase concentration became normal. At follow-up examination 4 and 8 weeks later the laboratory tests were normal.
This report of Augmentin-induced cholestasis is not unique. It shows that previous drug intake must be carefully investigated in any case of cholestasis of unknown cause.
Withdrawal from chronic cocaine reduces extracellular glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens by decreasing cystine/glutamate exchange (xc-). Activating xc- with N-acetylcysteine restores extracellular glutamate and prevents cocaine-induced drug seeking. It was hypothesized that the activation of xc- prevents drug seeking by increasing glutamatergic tone on presynaptic group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) and thereby inhibiting excitatory transmission. In the first experiment, the capacity of glutamate derived from xc- to regulate excitatory transmission via mGluR2/3 was determined. Physiological levels of cystine (100-300 nm) were restored to acute tissue slices from the nucleus accumbens or prefrontal cortex. Cystine increased glutamate efflux and decreased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) and spontaneous EPSC (sEPSC) frequency as well as evoked EPSC amplitude. These effects of cystine were presynaptic, because there was no change in mEPSC or sEPSC amplitude, and an increase in the evoked EPSC paired-pulse facilitation ratio. The cystine-induced reduction in EPSCs was reversed by blocking either xc- or mGluR2/3. In the second experiment, blocking mGluR2/3 prevented the ability of N-acetylcystine to inhibit the reinstatement of drug seeking in rats trained to self-administer cocaine. These data demonstrate that nonsynaptic glutamate derived from xc- modulates synaptic glutamate release and thereby regulates cocaine-induced drug seeking.
This study was designed to test the hypothesis that increasing the infusion rate of bile salts could overcome drug-induced cholestasis. Cholestasis was induced by administration of 17.5 mumol/L estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide during the infusion of taurocholate, tauroursodeoxycholate or dehydrocholate at 20 nmol/min/gm liver. After 30 min, a bolus of 10 mumol of the bile salts was added to the perfusate, and the infusion rate of each bile salt was increased. Taurocholate at a rate of 62 or 125 nmol/min/gm liver, caused a prompt dose-dependent increase of the depressed bile flow and bile salt excretion. A higher rate of taurocholate infusion (180 nmol/min/gm liver) was less effective than either the 62 or 125 rate in increasing bile flow. Infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate at 250 or 390 nmol/min/gm liver also led to a dose-dependent recovery. Further increase of tauroursodeoxycholate infusion rate of 580 nmol/min/gm liver did not provide any additional recovery in bile flow. Dehydrocholate, at rates of 62 or 125 nmol/min/gm liver, gave only a slight enhancement of bile flow. Both taurocholate and tauroursodeoxycholate caused a marked removal of the estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide, which had accumulated in the liver. At lower taurocholate infusion rates, the estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide was excreted mainly in the bile. At the highest rate, however, biliary excretion of estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide declined significantly, and a marked back-efflux of the estrogen into the perfusate was noted. In contrast, tauroursodeoxycholate led to enhanced biliary estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide excretion at all increased tauroursodeoxycholate infusion rates and to only a small increase in back-efflux of estradiol-17 beta-D-glucuronide at the two highest tauroursodeoxycholate infusion rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
