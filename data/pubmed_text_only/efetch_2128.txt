The nonsteroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used anticancer drug. In women with breast cancer, adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen reduces relapse and improves overall survival. In advanced breast cancer, the response rate is more than 50% in hormonal dependent disease. In women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen the incidence of new primary breast cancers is decreased. This latter observation has led to the initiation of prevention trials. In 1989 the first report from a large prospective randomised trial showed a significant increase of endometrial carcinoma among women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. This effect may be linked to the somewhat paradoxical estrogenic properties of tamoxifen. The endometrial effects should be considered in the long term use of tamoxifen, and should also be taken into account in the evaluation of the prevention trials. Animal data indicate that tamoxifen can induce tumours in other organ systems, for example the liver, but no increase in primary liver cancer has been reported from the randomised trials. In some of these trials an increase in other gastrointestinal cancers (e.g. colon and gastric carcinoma) has been observed. The mechanism behind this may be different from that of the endometrium. In animal systems, tamoxifen has shown to induce DNA damage, with formation of DNA adducts. The risk of secondary gastrointestinal cancer needs to be further evaluated. The adverse effects of tamoxifen have led to the development of new anti-estrogenic drugs and other estrogen reducing agents (e.g. aromatase inhibitors).
We report the case of 64-year-old female patient with pulmonary embolism and bilateral femoropopliteal deep vein thrombosis caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II) resistant to danaparoid sodium and subsequently administered lepirudin in whom a single late plasmapheresis performed on day 6 of the initiation of treatment of HIT reversed the course of the disease, preventing its highly potential fatal outcome. Primarily administered lepirudin was not only ineffective but even led to further aggravation of the patient's clinical state and platelet count drop in the first stage of the HIT treatment. The improvement of the patient's clinical state was not achieved before therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) had removed the greatest part of pathogenetic circulating substrate. Only after TPE, lepirudin, introduced again, led to the platelet count recovery. In the subsequent course of the treatment, lepirudin was combined with an overlapping oral anticoagulant. Previously positive heparin aggregation test and fast particle gel heparin-platelet factor 4 immunoassay were normalized as well as the patient's clinical status. Early plasmapheresis, administered within 4 days of the onset of thrombocytopenia in HIT, as a beneficial therapeutic measure in certain individual cases, is indisputable. However, our results do not concur with previously reported findings of the so far most comprehensive study on plasmapheresis performed in the management of HIT with thrombosis, discrediting late plasmapheresis administered 4 days after the onset of the disease not only as ineffective, but even as an aggravating factor. Our results suggest the possible beneficial impact of late plasmapheresis as a method that may reverse a prothrombotic process and lead to a fast improvement in the patient's platelet count, especially in cases initially resistant to thrombin inhibitors.
It is well known that in vitro the combination of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, or other antipseudomonal penicillins with gentamicin, tobramycin, or other aminoglycoside antibiotics results in the inactivation of the antibacterial activity of the aminoglycoside. To assess the influence of the in vivo interaction of tobramycin and ticarcillin on experimental nephrotoxicity, male Fischer 344 rats were given either tobramycin alone (120 mg/kg per day), tobramycin (120 mg/kg per day) and ticarcillin (250 mg/kg per day) concomitantly, or the combination of these drugs at the same doses that had been preincubated for 24 h and at the time of delivery contained but 63 and 25%, respectively, of the initial concentrations of tobramycin and ticarcillin as measured by conventional analytical procedures. Initial experiments were conducted to determine the concentrations of the antibiotics in serum achieved after administration of each test solution. After a single dose of the test solution, ticarcillin concentrations in serum were higher and more prolonged in rats given tobramycin plus ticarcillin than in rats given ticarcillin alone. After 7 days of exposure to the test solutions, inulin clearance in animals given tobramycin alone was 0.15 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- 2 standard errors) ml/min per 100 g of body weight as compared with 0.53 +/- 0.1 in rats given tobramycin and ticarcillin concomitantly, 0.59 +/- 0.1 in animals given the partially inactivated tobramycin-ticarcillin mixture, and 0.79 +/- 0.1 in control rats. Although there was some improvement in inulin clearance in the group containing tobramycin alone, the three treatment groups maintained the same rank relationship in inulin clearance through 14 days of treatment. Real histology confirmed the attenuation of tubular injury in animals given tobramycin and ticarcillin concomitantly. There was no evidence of toxicity from the presumed inactivation complexes of tobramycin-ticarcillin. These results document an in vivo protective effect of ticarcillin on experimental tobramycin nephrotoxicity.
The influence of ethinylostradiol on hepatocarcinogenesis was investigated in the female Dawley-rat. After 14 weekly gastric instillations of 50 mg diethylnitrosamine/kg and simultaneous administration of diet supplemented with ethinylostradiol 10 mg/l kg diet, 77.8% of the rats developed a hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, only 31.8% had carcinoma of the liver under similar experimental conditions. The relation of preneoplastic lesions correlated with that of carcinoma induction in both groups. If the results were to be valued on clinical relevance without difficulties a new orientation on surgical indication and transformation of the dignity of benign focal nodular hyperplasia would have to be considered.
To evaluate the effect of methyldopa on retinal artery circulation in pre-eclamptic gravidae using color Doppler imaging and spectral analysis.
Fifty-three pre-eclamptic singleton gravidae of gestational age greater than 22 weeks were examined. Patients with sustained hypertension after 1-2 days hospital rest were treated with oral antihypertensive medication, 250-500 mg methyldopa, three to four times a day for a minimum of 5-7 days. The right central retinal arteries were insonated and Doppler waveform values were analysed before and after medication.
The change of the maternal heart rate after methyldopa treatment was -3.96 +/- 7.88 beats per min (P = 0.0006). The change of fetal heart rate was not significantly altered. The change of the diastolic arterial blood pressure after treatment was -4.19 +/- 12.36 mmHg (P = 0.0169). In 36 gravidae, in whom hypotensive effects were noted after treatment with methyldopa, the increase in peak velocity, end-diastolic velocity and mean velocity of the retinal artery were 2.41 +/- 2.20 (P < 0.0001); 1.48 +/- 1.23 (P < 0.0001) and 1.70 +/- 1.42 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The decrease in pulsatility index of the retinal artery after treatment with methyldopa was -0.17 +/- 0.22 (P < 0.0001). In the remaining 17 gravidae, in whom no hypotensive effects were noted after treatment with methyldopa, the decrease in end-diastolic velocity and mean velocity were -1.50 +/- 1.70 (P = 0.0022) and -0.98 +/- 1.90 (P = 0.0488), respectively. The increase in pulsatility index was 0.34 +/- 0.30 (P = 0.0003).
In pre-eclamptic gravidae in whom the hypotensive effects were noted after treatment with methyldopa, the mean velocity of the retinal arteries was significantly higher and the mean pulsatility index lower after treatment. We conclude that the hypotensive effect of methyldopa in pre-eclamptic gravidae is associated with a significant decrease in retinal artery vascular resistance.
Our purpose was to evaluate the null hypothesis that dual tocolysis with magnesium sulfate and indomethacin does not alter the rate of grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage.
Fifty-six neonates weighing 500 to 800 gm from mothers who received tocolytic therapy with magnesium sulfate alone or in combination with indomethacin were the subjects of this retrospective study. Demographic variables were evaluated with a Student t test, chi(2) analysis, Fisher exact test, or Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) as appropriate.
There was an increased incidence of grade III to IV intraventricular hemorrhage among patients treated with dual therapy (p = 0.02). Logistic regression showed that fetal age and dual tocolysis with indomethacin were the only independent prognostic factors for severe intraventricular hemorrhage.
The results indicate that dual tocolysis with indomethacin may place extremely low-birth-weight infants at increased risk for grade III to IV intraventricular hemorrhage.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is frequent in obese subjects and has a relatively benign course; however, it may progress to cirrhosis. Weight loss in these patients may alleviate the findings of NASH. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pharmacological anti-obesity therapies on the findings of NASH.
There were thirteen patients (9 women, 4 men) in sibutramine group and 12 patients (8 women, 4 men) in orlistat group. The mean ages and body-mass indexes of the two groups were 42.5 years, 37.3 kg/m2 and 43.2 years, 36.1 kg/m2, respectively.
The obese subjects with NASH were given sibutramine or orlistat for six months. Additionally, all patients were given a low caloric diet. Liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT and ALP), insulin resistance (analysed by HOMA) and hepatic ultrasound (US) findings were assessed at baseline and after 6 months.
Both sibutramine and orlistat significantly reduced body weight (10.2 and 8.4%, respectively), insulin resistance (47 and 40%, respectively), AST (41 and 39%, respectively), ALT (59 and 58%, respectively), and GGT serum levels (27 and 25%, respectively). The ultrasonographic regression in steatosis was observed in 11 patients who received sibutramine and 8 patients who received orlistat. During the treatment, unexpectedly significant increases in total alkaline phosphatase levels were found in both sibutramine and orlistat groups (9 and 14%, respectively).
The present study shows that both sibutramine-induced and orlistat-induced weight losses result in reduction of insulin resistance, and improvements in biochemical markers and US findings of NASH. Because the GGT levels decreased in both groups, the increased ALP levels might have another source.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a syndrome that has been identified with increased frequency. The mortality associated with HIT approaches 35%. Previous strategies for treatment of the associated thrombosis with HIT have frustrated clinicians with poor outcomes. Recent awareness of the complex pathophysiology of HIT combined with the availability of new anticoagulants has led to the development of a rational therapeutic strategy for this group of patients. The foundation of this strategy involves thrombin inhibition and careful patient monitoring. Our preliminary results with the thrombin inhibitor argatroban (Novastan) have been favorable and warrant continued investigation.
An animal model system has been established which reproduces some of the features of the Fetal Hydantoin Syndrome. This pattern of altered growth and development includes growth retardation, craniofacial anomalies, distal phalangeal hypoplasia, and mental deficiency. Rats exposed in utero to phenytoin on gestational days 9, 11, and 13 exhibited fetal onset growth retardation, abnormalities of the craniofacial region and axial skeleton. In addition, the exposed offspring had significantly lower fetal weights, a shortened snout and a high-arched, irregular palate, and significant delays in skeletal maturation. These abnormalities resemble those reported for the Fetal Hydantoin Syndrome and provide a means to study the effect of phenytoin on the morphological and biochemical development of the fetus.
Orthostatic hypotension either because of autonomic failure or neurocardiogenic syncope can be very incapacitating and should be treated accordingly. Drug therapy is frequently needed to alleviate orthostatic symptoms. The physiopathological basis of neurocardiogenic syncope and of autonomic failure is completely different and their treatment should be distinct. In the past 5 years, many randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shed light on the efficacy of specific pressor drugs. In patients with orthostatic hypotension because of autonomic failure, alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, and midodrine in particular, have been shown to increase standing blood pressure and decrease orthostatic symptoms. Other drugs such as octreotide, indomethacin or ergotamine have also been shown to elevate standing blood pressure and/or orthostatic tolerance. Fludrocortisone is a well known and frequently used pressor drug but randomized controlled studies are needed to measure its efficacy. In patients with orthostatic hypotension associated with neurocardiogenic syncope, clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers, especially beta(1)-selective agents without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as atenolol, midodrine and paroxetine can decrease recurrence of syncope. Treatment algorithms, such as those presented in this review, should always be interpreted in the light of individual patient characteristics. Many of the drugs used for orthostatic hypotension have multiple indications and contraindications that should influence therapeutic decisions. Little is known about the effectiveness and tolerability of specific combinations of pressor drugs. Consequently, sound clinical judgment and close follow-up of patients should always guide combination therapy.
This case report describes for the first time acute coronary syndrome in a 67-year old patient after oral intake of naratriptan for migraine. So far in the literature, only sumatriptan, zolmitriptan and frovatriptan have been described to cause acute coronary syndromes. A 67-year old Swiss woman with thoracic pain after intake of 2.5 mg naratriptan presented with T-wave inversions in the ECG and a positive troponin-T at our hospital. Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. Naratriptan-induced coronary vasospasms were thought to have caused the acute coronary syndrome.Triptans should not be prescribed in patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease. However, triptans can also cause acute coronary syndromes in patients without coronary heart disease--as described in our case report. Severe or persistent thoracic pain after intake of triptans should therefore be investigated accordingly.
Cannabinoids can evoke antihyperalgesia and antinociception at a peripheral site of action. However, the signaling pathways mediating these effects are not clearly understood. We tested the hypothesis that certain cannabinoids directly inhibit peripheral capsaicin-sensitive nociceptive neurons by dephosphorylating and desensitizing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) via a calcium calcineurin-dependent mechanism. Application of the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) to cultured trigeminal (TG) neurons or isolated skin biopsies rapidly and significantly inhibited capsaicin-activated inward currents and neuropeptide exocytosis by a mechanism requiring the presence of extracellular calcium. The inhibitory effect did not involve activation of G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors, because neither pertussis toxin nor GDPbetaS treatments altered the WIN effect. However, application of WIN-activated calcineurin, as measured by nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)c4 transcription factor, dephosphorylated TRPV1. The WIN-induced desensitization of TRPV1 was mediated by calcineurin, because the application of structurally distinct calcineurin antagonists (calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide and cyclosporine/cyclophilin complex) abolished WIN-induced inhibition of capsaicin-evoked inward currents and neuropeptide exocytosis. This mechanism also contributed to peripheral antinociceptive/antihyperalgesic effects of WIN because pretreatment with the calcineurin antagonist calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (CAIP) significantly reduced peripherally mediated WIN effects in two behavioral models. Collectively, these data demonstrate that cannabinoids such as WIN directly inhibit TRPV1 functional activities via a calcineurin pathway that represents a mechanism of cannabinoid actions at peripheral sites.
Previous studies have proposed that sodium supplement to nonionic contrast media (CM) can decrease the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF). This study was designed to compare the occurence of VF induced by ioxilan (containing 9 mmol/LNa+) with other nonionic CMs. After wedging a catheter in the right coronary artery, test solutions including ioxilan, ioversol, iomeprol, and iopromide were infused for 30 sec at the rate of 0.4 ml/sec or until VF occurred. Then, incidence of VF, contact time (i.e. the time required to produce VF), and QTc were measured. Also, the CMs other than ioxilan were investigated at sodium levels adjusted to 9 and 20 mmol/L Na+. The incidence of VF with ioxilan (0%) was the lowest of all. In the other CMs, the incidence decreased in accordance with increase of sodium. Iomeprol and iopromide showed significant reduction of VF incidence at the sodium level of 20 mmol/L. The higher sodium supplements also prolonged the contact times. The increase of QTc was the greatest in ioxilan. Ioxilan has the least arrythmogenic property among the current low-osmolality nonionic CMs. This property might be attributable to an optimal sodium concentration of 9 mmol/L in the CM.
Human malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an asbestos-related malignancy characterized by frequent resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Here, we investigated the feasibility of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition by temsirolimus as an antimesothelioma strategy.
Phosphorylation of mTOR (p-mTOR) was assessed by immunohistochemistry in MPM surgical specimens (n = 70). Activation of mTOR and impact of mTOR inhibition by temsirolimus was determined in MPM cell lines in vitro (n = 6) and in vivo as xenografts in severe combined immunodeficiency mice (n = 2) either as single agent or in combination with cisplatin.
Strong immunoreactivity for p-mTOR was predominantly detected in epitheloid and biphasic but not sarcomatoid MPM specimens while adjacent normal tissues remained widely unstained. Accordingly, all mesothelioma cell lines harbored activated mTOR, which was further confirmed by hyperphosphorylation of the downstream targets pS6K, S6, and 4EBP1. Temsirolimus potently blocked mTOR-mediated signals and exerted a cytostatic effect on mesothelioma cell lines in vitro cultured both as adherent monolayers and as nonadherent spheroids. Mesothelioma cells with intrinsic or acquired cisplatin resistance exhibited hypersensitivity against temsirolimus. Accordingly, cisplatin and temsirolimus exerted synergistic inhibition of the mTOR downstream signals and enhanced growth inhibition and/or apoptosis induction in mesothelioma cell lines. Finally, temsirolimus was highly active against MPM xenograft models in severe combined immunodeficiency mice both as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin.
The mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus is active against mesothelioma in vitro and in vivo and synergizes with chemotherapy. These data suggest mTOR inhibition as a promising novel therapeutic strategy against MPM.
We examined longitudinal disability scores in 54 patients with Parkinson's disease followed for 6 years at UCLA. We sorted data into 3 groups based on age at onset of symptoms: group A, onset under 50 years; group B, 50 to 59 years; group C, 60 years or older. There were no significant differences between groups initially. All 3 groups improved dramatically when levodopa was given, but group A showed significantly less disability in years 4, 5, and 6 than did group C. The groups did not differ with respect to side effects. To determine if age at onset affected mortality, we sorted records from 4 geographically diverse centers into the same 3 groups. Results on 359 patients followed for 3,314 person-years, covering a period of 17 years after onset of symptoms, showed that group A had the most favorable observed-to-expected mortality ratio, 1.82, compared with 2.17 and 2.20 for groups B and C respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. Results from the disability analyses indicate that patients with onset of Parkinson's disease under 50 years of age may have a more favorable prognosis than those whose symptoms begin in later years.
Mice have been used extensively for studying normal prostate development and for generation of transgenic or knock-out prostate cancer animal models. To understand systematically and thoroughly the androgen responsive program in the mouse prostate, we carried out microarray analysis to profile gene expression changes during prostate involution and re-growth triggered by castration and subsequent hormone replacement. Genes with significant changes in these two processes were identified and gene ontology analyses revealed that they were mainly involved in response mechanisms, cell adhesion, metabolism, protein metabolism, and cell-cycle progression. The changes observed during prostate involution were largely reversed during re-growth. Sixty-four genes, including Nkx3.1 and probasin, and 65 other genes, including insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 and H-cadherin (H-Cad), were further identified respectively as androgen-responsive genes and genes inversely correlated with androgen, based on their down- or up-regulation following castration and up- or down-regulation following androgen replacement. Potential androgen-responsive elements were found in the 5' upstream promoter region of 47 of those 65 genes, suggesting a potential suppression mechanism by androgen receptor. Of these, the role of H-Cad in tumorigenesis was further evaluated. Reduction of H-Cad transcript level was found in the majority of human prostate cancer cell lines and prostatic adenocarcinoma samples examined. Furthermore, induced H-Cad expression in DU145 cells, and knock-down of H-Cad expression in BPH1 cells inhibited and facilitated tumorigenicity, respectively. Taken together, our study provides a molecular understanding of the mouse prostate involution and re-growth processes and identifies a set of genes that are inversely correlated with androgen and may be potentially suppressive for tumorigenesis.
Fifty-five patients suffering from refractory chronic back pain took part in a double-blind, multiple-dose, randomised, cross-over study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose capsule preparation containing 500 mg paracetamol (CAS 103-90-2) and 30 mg codeine phosphate 1/2 H2O (CAS 41444-62-6) (talvosilen forte, test preparation) with a reference capsule preparation containing 50 mg tramadol hydrochloride (CAS 22204-88-2), in a regimen of two capsules 8-hourly. There were two treatment periods of up to 7 days each. Cross-over took place, without washout, at the end of 7 days, or sooner if patients were unable to tolerate the first treatment. The test preparation was at least as efficacious as the reference in the treatment of back pain (81% of patients experienced good or satisfactory pain relief). 81% of patients tolerated the test well compared to only 69% receiving the reference, as per protocol analysis. The results of this study suggest that the test product is at least as efficacious as tramadol in the treatment of patients with refractory chronic back pain, whilst being better tolerated.
We studied 25 patients treated with oral phosphate and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D for 0.5-15 y (mean, 7 y) to determine the incidence of nephrocalcinosis and its relationship to treatment, renal function, and growth. During the follow-up period, 3 hypercalcaemic and 13 random hypercalciuric episodes were documented. Creatinine clearances and urine concentration tests were normal in all patients. One patient's 24-h urine specimen indicated hypercalciuria. Kidney ultrasonography revealed nephrocalcinosis in 80% of the patients, but its severity was not significantly related to the dose of calcitriol or of phosphate, the duration of treatment, the age at which treatment was started, or growth. None of the 9 untreated affected family members had nephrocalcinosis. Longitudinal studies revealed that the greatest loss in height velocity occurred during the first 2 y of life. Our study shows that nephrocalcinosis is a common complication of phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, but it is not necessarily associated with impaired renal function. Although the treatment failed to prevent a decrease in height velocity during infancy, it effectively maintained height velocity after 2 y of age.
The effect of inosine on adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy was studied. Total adriamycin (ADR) dose of 25 mg/kg i.p. injected in 15 equal partial doses 3 times a week for five following weeks evoked fully developed cardiomyopathy in rats. Inosine 200 mg/kg i.p. injected 5 times a week parallel to ADR diminished ADR cardiotoxicity evaluated by electrocardiographic recordings and histopathological examination. Moreover lower cytostatic toxicity was observed as judged by less-expressed leucopenia and lower SGOT activities in inosine treated animals.
The cytotoxic ability of T-cells against tumor cells may be increased by interleukin (IL)-2. The infiltration of tumors by these cytotoxic T-cells may be enhanced by low-dose cyclophosphamide, which may also serve to deplete regulatory T-cells. Famotidine may increase IL-2 internalization by the IL-2 receptor on T-lymphocytes. We have treated 14 patients with either metastatic melanoma or kidney cancer, using CY 350 mg/M(2) intravenously (i.v.) over 1 hour followed by a continuous infusion IL-2 9 MIU/M(2)/24 hours for 72 hours and famotidine 20 mg i.v. twice per day. All patients had received prior systemic therapy. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks until disease progression.
8 with melanoma, 8 males, median age, 64, median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, 1; most common metastatic sites: lungs, lymph nodes, bone, and liver. Median number of cycles received=2 (range, 2-4). Most common toxicities were fever, nausea/emesis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, and rigors. All patients were treated on an oncology inpatient unit. One (1) patient with kidney cancer has had a partial response in lung and lymph nodes for 5 months, while 1 patient with melanoma had a partial response in pulmonary metastases. Cyclophosphamide and IL-2 with famotidine has evidence of antitumor activity in previously treated kidney cancer and melanoma.
In a randomised, double-blind, four-way crossover study, 24 healthy volunteers received 240 mg/d pentaerithritol tetranitrate (PETN, CAS 78-11-5), 150 mg/d PETN, 60 mg/d isosorbide mononitrate slow release (ISMN, CAS 16051-77-7) or placebo in each study period for two days. Headache and disability to work were self-rated six times per day; individual measurements were combined to total scores. ISMN caused headaches more frequently (in approx. 90% of volunteers) and more severe (average total score 15.2) and a greater disability (average total score 6.0) than the high or low PETN-dosage (both in approx. 50%, headache score 4.9 or 6.4, disability score 1.1 or 2.1, resp.) and placebo (in approx. 10%, headache 0.8, disability 0), all these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon). The high PETN-dosage showed a non-significant trend to produce fewer systemic side effects than the low PETN-dosage (not vice versa). With ISMN six volunteers prematurely terminated the study period and one volunteer who was replaced withdrew from the entire study due to side effects; all volunteers completed the study periods with the other medications.
The central role of chemokines in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has been made clear. Recently polymorphisms in the gene regulatory region of MCP-1 and in the promoter region of RANTES have been found, which increase the expression of these chemokines. We investigated the role of these polymorphisms together with the chemokine SDF-1-801A and the chemokine receptors CCR2-64I and CCR5Delta32 mutations in 318 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) referred to coronary bypass surgery, comparing them with 320 healthy controls. The prevalence of the MCP-1 -2518 G/G homozygotes was significantly higher among CAD patients than among controls (P<0.005; OR=2.2 (95% CI 1.25-3.92). The Lp(a) levels of CAD patients with G/G genotype were significantly higher than those in patients with G/A or A/A genotypes. No CAD patients homozygous for the CCR5Delta32 and CCR2-64I mutations have been found. The genotype distributions of the two alleles deviated from the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in patients, indicating that the numbers of homozygotes were significantly lower than expected. The MCP-1 -2518G variant in homozygous form appears as a genetic risk factor for severe CAD. This genotype is associated with elevated Lp(a) levels in patients. Individuals homozygous for CCR2-64I or CCR5Delta32 mutations are at reduced risk for severe CAD.
We investigated the ability of the mammary gland to metabolically activate 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). Although mammary gland microsomes had almost no capacity to metabolically activate the parent compounds, mammary gland cytosol was able to esterify the N-hydroxylamines. Acetyltransferase was the primary enzyme responsible for the phase II activation of the N-hydroxylamines. The level of acetyl CoA-stimulated binding when N-hydroxy PhIP served as the substrate was approximately 3- and 17-fold higher than when IQ and MeIQx served as substrates, respectively. N-Hydroxy-IQ and N-hydroxy PhIP can also be activated by tRNA synthetase and phosphatase, but not by sulfotransferase. However, the levels of proline- and ATP-enhanced DNA binding was approximately 30- and 60-fold lower than the acetyl CoA-enhanced DNA binding of IQ and PhIP, respectively. Differences observed in the phase II activation of the various heterocyclic amines in the mammary gland may explain why the mammary gland is a target organ for PhIP-induced carcinogenicity but not for IQ- or MeIQx-induced carcinogenicity in Fischer 344 rats.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy and mesna have been successfully used for hemorrhagic cystitis. We defined the protective effects of hyperbaric oxygen and mesna in further cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis in guinea pigs.
A total of 48 male guinea pigs were divided into 6 groups. All groups received 2 doses of 68.1 mg./kg. cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally at the same time intervals but group 1 served as controls. Group 2 received cyclophosphamide only, group 3 received hyperbaric oxygen treatment (2.8 ATA for 90 minutes twice daily) before and the day after further cyclophosphamide, group 4 received 21.5 mg./kg. mesna intraperitoneally only with further cyclophosphamide, group 5 received hyperbaric oxygen and mesna with further cyclophosphamide, and group 6 received hyperbaric oxygen before initial cyclophosphamide, between the 2 doses and after the further dose of cyclophosphamide, and mesna on the days of cyclophosphamide.
Although mesna alone provided protection against cyclophosphamide induced cystitis in animal bladders, there was also significant damage compared with controls. When the uroprotective efficacy of mesna was supported with hyperbaric oxygen, bladder protection was promoted since mean histological scores and hematuria levels in this group did not differ from those in controls.
According to this animal study using hyperbaric oxygen as adjuvant therapy in humans may be a better tool than mesna alone for the prophylaxis and treatment of cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
