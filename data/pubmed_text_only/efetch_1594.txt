This report concerns two rare autopsy cases of methotrexate (MTX)-related leukoencephalopathy without radiation therapy. In the first case, there were widespread necrotic foci with prominent spheroids, that is, disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (DNL), mainly in the cerebral white matter. In contrast, in the second case, there were widespread demyelinated foci without significant axonal changes, which we would like to name disseminated demyelinating leukoencephalopathy (DDL), mainly in the cerebral white matter. We emphasize that the pathology of pure MTX-related leukoencephalopathy is not uniform, and may show at least two kinds of histologic change. Furthermore, both cases did not develop significant vascular changes, which are usually induced by radiation therapy. The distribution of the lesions in two cases was examined by large specimens, including hemisphere specimens. The distribution of the lesions in the brain of our cases was also different. In the first case, the DNL lesions were predominantly distributed in the frontal and temporal lobes. In the second case, the DDL lesions were prominently localized in the occipital lobe. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing not only the pathological findings of MTX-related leukoencephalopathy without irradiation but also the precise distributions of the lesions.
Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) and Withdrawal Seizure-Resistant (WSR) mice were selectively bred for high and low handling-induced convulsions, respectively, after chronic ethanol treatment. Withdrawal severity is one factor that may contribute to the development of alcoholism and/or substance abuse, and anxiety is another. We sought to explore whether these factors are genetically related.
WSP and WSR mice of two replicate pairs of selected lines were tested for anxiety-related behaviors on the canopy stretched-attend-posture apparatus 20 min after intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (2 g/kg, 20% v/v), pentobarbital (20 mg/kg), or an equivalent volume of saline. Dependent measures of anxiety included number of stretched attend postures (SAP) and time spent in the exposed area of the apparatus. Number of line crossings, which measures overall activity, was also scored.
WSP mice given saline exhibited more SAP than WSR mice given saline, which indicated greater baseline anxiety. Ethanol and pentobarbital both reduced SAP and increased time spent in the exposed area of the apparatus, which indicated that both drugs exerted an anxiolytic effect. Despite baseline differences in SAP between selected lines, both anxiolytic drugs reduced SAP to similar levels in WSP and WSR mice.
These results support the hypothesis that WSP mice are more sensitive than WSR mice to the anxiety-reducing effects of ethanol and pentobarbital. Some genes that influence this difference are likely to be the same as those that influence ethanol withdrawal severity. Thus, higher basal anxiety and greater genetic sensitivity to anxiolytic drug effects may relate to a greater genetic predisposition to the development of severe alcohol withdrawal signs.
Treatment of acromegaly with intermittent sc injections of octreotide is associated with an increased incidence of cholelithiasis. We investigated the incidence of gallstone formation, the occurrence of gallbladder disease, and the response of gallstones to ursodeoxycholic acid in 30 acromegalic patients who were treated with a continuous sc infusion of octreotide at doses between 200 and 800 micrograms/day for 3-70 months. Of the 30 patients, 28 had pretretment ultrasonography of the biliary tree performed, and all had frequent follow-ups. Nine patients underwent pre- and posttreatment bile sampling. No patient treated for less than 6 months and 18.5% of patients treated for more than 6 months developed new gallstones. No patient developed symptomatic cholelithiasis while receiving octreotide therapy. Of six patients who developed gallstones, four were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, which dissolved all gallstones. One patient with gallstones experienced an episode of biliary colic when octreotide was withdrawn; however, no cholecystitis was found at subsequent cholecystectomy. Bile sampling showed that 8 (75%) of the 12 patients who were assessed demonstrated microcrystals, whereas in 3 (50%) of 6 patients who were closely analyzed thereafter, microcrystals disappeared once octreotide therapy was stopped. Our results show that continuous sc infusion octreotide therapy increases the incidence of cholelithiasis over normal values, as is the case with intermittent sc injections. Although higher octreotide levels are sustained with continuous sc infusion, this is not associated with an increased risk of gallstone formation compared with intermittent sc octreotide therapy.
Our previous work supports a role for aquaporin-8 (AQP8) water channels in rat hepatocyte bile formation mainly by facilitating the osmotically driven canalicular secretion of water. In this study, we tested whether a condition with compromised canalicular bile secretion, i.e., the estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, displays defective hepatocyte AQP8 functional expression. After 17alpha-ethinylestradiol administration (5 mg x kg body wt(-1).day(-1) for 5 days) to rats, the bile flow was reduced by 58% (P < 0.05). By subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting analysis, we found that 34 kDa AQP8 was significantly decreased by approximately 70% in plasma (canalicular) and intracellular (vesicular) liver membranes. However, 17alpha-ethinylestradiol-induced cholestasis did not significantly affect the protein level or the subcellular localization of sinusoidal AQP9. Immunohistochemistry for liver AQPs confirmed these observations. Osmotic water permeability (P(f)) of canalicular membranes, measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry, was significantly reduced (73 +/- 1 vs. 57 +/- 2 microm/s) in cholestasis, consistent with defective canalicular AQP8 functional expression. By Northern blotting, we found that AQP8 mRNA expression was increased by 115% in cholestasis, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism of protein level reduction. Accordingly, studies in primary cultured rat hepatocytes indicated that the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin prevented the estrogen-induced AQP8 downregulation. In conclusion, hepatocyte AQP8 protein expression is downregulated in estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, presumably by lysosomal-mediated degradation. Reduced canalicular membrane AQP8 expression is associated with impaired osmotic membrane water permeability. Our data support the novel notion that a defective expression of canalicular AQP8 contributes as a mechanism for bile secretory dysfunction of cholestatic hepatocytes.
A woman developed a prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes while on methadone treatment for heroin addiction. We think methadone, or its impaired metabolism, was the major cause for her prolonged QT interval and progression to torsade. However, torsade is often multifactorial, as was likely so in this case. We advise physicians treating patients taking methadone to obtain careful medication and drug-use histories, screen for risk factors associated with long QT syndrome, counsel patients about potential drug interactions, and measure the QT interval before and during methadone treatment in high-risk patients.
Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a rare bone marrow failure syndrome in which hematopoietic defects are the main cause of mortality. The most studied gene responsible for DC pathogenesis is DKC1 while mutations in several other genes encoding components of the H/ACA RNP telomerase complex, which is involved in ribosomal RNA(rRNA) processing and telomere maintenance, have also been implicated. GAR1/nola1 is one of the four core proteins of the H/ACA RNP complex. Through comparative analysis of morpholino oligonucleotide induced knockdown of dkc1 and a retrovirus insertion induced mutation of GAR1/nola1 in zebrafish, we demonstrate that hematopoietic defects are specifically recapitulated in these models and that these defects are significantly reduced in a p53 null mutant background. We further show that changes in telomerase activity are undetectable at the early stages of DC pathogenesis but rRNA processing is clearly defective. Our data therefore support a model that deficiency in dkc1 and nola1 in the H/ACA RNP complex likely contributes to the hematopoietic phenotype through p53 activation associated with rRNA processing defects rather than telomerase deficiency during the initial stage of DC pathogenesis.
Phyllanthus urinaria is widely used as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-hepatotoxic medicines in almost every tropical country. However, scientific evidence supporting its use in cancer metastasis is limited, particularly osteosarcoma. We investigated the effect of P. urinaria extract (PUE) on cell viability, invasion, and migration in the human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell line, and looked at the impact of PUE on several relevant proteases and signaling pathways. This study demonstrates that PUE, at a range of concentrations (from 0 to 100 μg/ml), concentration-dependently inhibited the migration/invasion capacities of Saos-2 without cytotoxic effects. Zymographic and western blot analyses revealed that PUE inhibited the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) enzyme activity, as well as protein expression. Western blot analysis also showed that PUE inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Testing of mRNA level, quantitative real-time PCR, and promoter assays evaluated the inhibitory effects of PUE on u-PA expression in Saos-2 cells. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was reactive to the transcription protein SP-1, which was inhibited by PUE. In conclusion, PUE suppresses human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell invasion and migration by transcriptionally inhibiting u-PA via ERK and Akt signaling pathways. Therefore, PUE produces anti-metastatic activity in Saos-2 cells.
The peroxisomal membrane protein, with a relative molecular mass of 70,000 (M(r) 70K) (PMP70), is an important component of peroxisomal membranes and an ATP-binding cassette protein. To investigate its possible involvement in Zellweger syndrome (ZS), an inborn error of peroxisome assembly, we cloned and sequenced cDNAs for human PMP70 and mapped the gene to chromosome 1. Amongst 32 probands with ZS or related disorders, we found two mutant PMP70 alleles in single ZS probands from the same complementation group. One allele has a donor splice site mutation and the second a missense mutation. Our results suggest that PMP70 plays an important role in peroxisome biogenesis and that mutations in PMP70 may be responsible for a subset of ZS patients.
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of dopamine. Recently, we described a point mutation in hTH (Q381K) in a family of two siblings suffering from progressive L-DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD), representing the first reported mutation in this gene. We here describe the cloning, expression and steady-state kinetic properties of the recombinant mutant enzyme. When expressed by a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system and in E. coli, the mutant enzyme represents a kinetic variant form, with a reduced affinity for L-tyrosine. The 'residual activity' of about 15% of the corresponding wild-type hTH (isoform hTH1), at substrate concentrations prevailing in vivo, is compatible with the clinical phenotype of the two Q381K homozygote patients carrying this recessively inherited mutation.
Animal and human experimental studies have yielded conflicted data regarding the effects of cocaine on cardiovascular function. We studied the cardiac and hemodynamic profiles in emergency department chest pain patients following recent cocaine use.
After obtaining informed consent, emergency department patients who presented with a chief complaint of chest pain and cocaine use within 24 hours of arrival were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a structured 40-item history and physical examination and were placed on the IQ Noninvasive Hemodynamic Surveillance System (Renaissance Technology, Inc., Newton, PA), a validated transthoracic cardiac output monitor. The principal measurements obtained included cardiac output, cardiac index, and stroke volume. Data were analyzed with standard descriptive techniques.
Twenty-seven patients were enrolled (median age, 37 years [range, 23-54]; 74% male). Patients used a mean of $200 worth of cocaine, usually crack (67%). Patients had a history of tobacco use (82%), prior myocardial infarction (33%), and prior cocaine-associated chest pain (67%). The median (interquartile range; IQR) for the hemodynamic parameters were: mean arterial blood pressure 92 mm Hg (IQR 85-100); heart rate 83/min (IQR 72-98); cardiac output 6.9 L/min (IQR 5.1-7.2); cardiac index 3.2 L/min/m2 (IQR 2.4-4.0); stroke volume 78 mL/beat (IQR 64-93).
Most emergency department patients with cocaine-associated chest pain have normal cardiac profiles at the time of presentation. The negative inotropic effects of high doses of cocaine observed in animal models do not appear to be present in patients who develop chest pain after using recreational doses of cocaine.
The literature on low-dose heparin thrombosis prophylaxis has been reviewed to evaluate differences in effect and bleeding complications between heparin administered at twelve- and eight-hour intervals. The more frequent administration gives a slightly greater reduction of the overall frequency of thrombosis but is not more effective in reducing extensive thrombi or fatal pulmonary emboli. Moreover, it causes more haemorrage, which is why it is concluded that the twelve-hourly interval must be recommended.
Chronic lead exposure induces hypertension and alters endothelial function. However, treatment with low lead concentrations was not yet explored. We analyzed the effects of 7 day exposure to low lead concentrations on endothelium-dependent responses. Wistar rats were treated with lead (1st dose 4 µg/100 g, subsequent dose 0.05 µg/100 g, i.m. to cover daily loss) or vehicle; blood levels attained at the end of treatment were 9.98 µg/dL. Lead treatment had the following effects: increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP); reduction of contractile response to phenylephrine (1 nM-100 µM) of aortic rings; unaffected relaxation induced by acetylcholine (0.1 nM-300 µM) or sodium nitroprusside (0.01 nM-0.3 µM). Endothelium removal, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 µM) and tetraethylammonium (2 mM) increased the response to phenylephrine in treated rats more than in untreated rats. Aminoguanidine (50 µM) increased but losartan (10 µM) and enalapril (10 µM) reduced the response to phenylephrine in treated rats. Lead treatment also increased aortic Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase functional activity, plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, protein expression of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha-1 subunit, phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Our results suggest that on initial stages of lead exposure, increased SBP is caused by the increase in plasma ACE activity. This effect is accompanied by increased p-eNOS, iNOS protein expression and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase functional activity. These factors might be a compensatory mechanism to the increase in SBP.
Treatment with alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor blockers improves lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that induction of apoptosis in prostate tissue could be a mechanism underlying the observed clinical benefit. This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial enrolled 536 men with LUTS who were treated with alfuzosin (10 or 15 mg) once daily or placebo for 3 months. Total prostate and transition zone volume was measured by standardized transrectal ultrasound measurements at baseline and 3 months. Total prostate volume increased by 0.4 ml from baseline in placebo patients but decreased by -0.25 ml in the combined alfuzosin groups. Percentage change was not statistically significantly different between the placebo and alfuzosin groups. Changes in transition zone volumes from baseline were similar in both treatment arms; percentage change was not statistically significantly different between the placebo and alfuzosin groups. Volume changes did not correlate with prostate volumes at baseline. Overall, neither total prostate nor transition zone volume increased or decreased systematically within the 3-month treatment period. If alfuzosin-induced apoptosis in prostate tissue, it was not evident by a measurable change in prostate volume after 3 months' treatment. Further analysis at 1 and 2 years will determine the effect of longer-term treatment.
Folate plays an important role in carcinogenesis. The enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), encoded by the MTHFR gene, is involved in this process. We investigated both the independent and joint effects of dietary folate and other methyl-related nutrients, as well as three polymorphisms of MTHFR (677C>T, 1298A>C, and 1793G>A), on endometrial cancer risk in a population-based case-control study. Between 1997 and 2003, 1,204 newly diagnosed endometrial cancer cases and 1,212 controls were recruited among women between the ages of 30 and 69 years in urban Shanghai, China. Information on dietary intake of folate and other methyl-related nutrients, including vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and methionine, was derived from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Genotyping was completed on 1,041 cases and 1,030 controls for MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133), 1298A>C (rs1801131), and 1793 G>A (rs2274967) [corrected] Haplotype estimation of the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms was performed using PHASE software. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate associations of nutrients, MTHFR genotypes, and haplotypes with endometrial cancer risk. A significant inverse association between dietary folate intake and endometrial cancer risk was observed among all subjects and non-B vitamin supplement users. The greatest reduction in endometrial cancer risk was observed among non-users of supplements in the highest quartile of dietary folate intake (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7) as compared with those in the lowest quartile. Dietary intake of folate cofactors (methionine, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12) was not related to risk of endometrial cancer. No association was observed between endometrial cancer and the MTHFR 677C>T, 1298 A>C, and 1793G>A polymorphisms or derived haplotypes. Among non-users of supplements, however, the 1298C and 1793A alleles were associated with a lower risk of endometrial cancer among women with high dietary folate intake but related to a higher risk among those with low dietary folate intake (P(interaction) = 0.08 and 0.03, respectively). Further analysis showed that the lowest risk (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-1.1) was among women with the 1298C allele and the highest intake of both folate and riboflavin (P(interaction) = 0.04). A similar association was observed for the 1793A allele (P(interaction) = 0.03). Our findings suggest that folate intake may decrease the risk of endometrial cancer and modify the effect of MTHFR polymorphisms on risk.
Arsenic exposure from drinking water is considered to be a risk factor for skin and internal cancers. Animal studies suggest a potential antagonism between arsenic and selenium in the body. We did a case-cohort analysis to prospectively evaluate the association between arsenic-related premalignant skin lesions and prediagnostic blood selenium levels in 303 cases of skin lesions newly diagnosed from November 2002 to April 2004 and 849 subcohort members randomly selected from the 8,092 participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study with available baseline blood and urine samples collected in 2000. Incidence rate ratios for skin lesions in increasing blood selenium quintiles were 1.00 (reference), 0.68 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.39-1.18], 0.51 (95% CI, 0.29-0.87), 0.52 (95% CI, 0.30-0.91), and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.31-0.90). Effect estimates remained similar with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, excessive sunlight exposure (in men), well water arsenic concentration at baseline, and nutritional intakes of folate, iron, protein, vitamin E, and B vitamins. At any given arsenic exposure level, the risk of premalignant skin lesions was consistently greater among participants with blood selenium lower than the average level. The findings support the hypothesis that dietary selenium intake may reduce the incidence of arsenic-related premalignant skin lesions among populations exposed to arsenic exposure from drinking water.
A single dose of 15 mg/kg dimethylnitrosamine is an initiator of hepatic tumour formation in rats but does not produce tumours without further treatment. Subsequent promotion by Na phenobarbitone (1000 micrograms/ml drinking water) leads to 40% or more of the rats developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Four days of dietary treatment designed to produce a wave of DNA synthesis at the time of initiation leads to an even greater yield of tumours and nodules after promotion. This effect of phenobarbitone does not appear to be directly related to its ability to induce enzyme activity in the liver because lower doses of phenobarbitone (100 micrograms/ml or less) did not promote tumour development in spite of being adequate for the induction of cytochrome P-450 and associated enzyme activity. A similar incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was found in both the groups given DMN and the top dose of Na phenobarbitone (1000 micrograms/ml) whether or not they had been given the dietary pretreatment. However, hyperplastic nodules were seen only in the diet pre-treated group. This is discussed in relation to the hypothesis that hyperplastic nodules are precursors of hepatic carcinoma.
Autoradiographic binding density of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an indirect measure of ACE activity, is markedly increased at sites of fibrous tissue that appear in the injured heart. This includes myocardial infarction (MI) caused by left coronary artery ligation; endocardial fibrosis of the interventricular septum and perivascular fibrosis of intramyocardial coronary arterioles of the right ventricle, each of which appear remote to MI; and pericardial fibrosis after pericardiotomy (without MI). Expressed in fibroblast-like cells found at each site of tissue repair, ACE may be common to tissue repair in the rat heart, irrespective of the etiologic basis of injury. To address this hypothesis and to determine whether this also applies to other tissues (skin and kidney), the present study was undertaken. ACE binding density was measured by quantitative in vitro autoradiography (125I-351A) in injured rat heart, skin, and kidney. Experimental observations included foreign-body fibrosis after placement of silk ligature in skin or myocardium, endomyocardial myocyte necrosis and fibrosis that accompanied isoproterenol administration (1 mg/kg sc x 2 days), and embolic infarction of the kidney as a result of mural thrombus of the left ventricle that appeared after anterior MI. Fibrosis was identified by collagen-specific staining with picrosirius red. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical labeling with alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) antibody were used to address cell morphology and phenotype, respectively. We found (1) endomyocardial fibrosis 2 weeks after isoproterenol; (2) fibrosis surrounding silk suture in heart and skin 1 week after placement; (3) renal infarction 1 week after left coronary artery ligation; (4) numerous fibroblast-like cells containing alpha-SMA, as well as macrophages, at sites of repair in all tissues studied; and (5) markedly increased ACE binding density at each of these sites. Thus ACE is integral to tissue repair in the heart, skin, and kidney of the rat, irrespective of the etiologic basis of injury. At these sites ACE may serve to regulate local concentrations of substances involved in tissue repair.
Genetic factors are major contributors in determining the susceptibility to systemic autoimmune diseases. We studied the influence of genotype on systemic autoimmunity by treating female mice of the H-2s strains SJL/N, SJL/J, A.SW, and B10.S with mercuric chloride (HgCl2) for 10 weeks and then following autoantibody and tissue immune deposits during the subsequent 12 months. All strains developed antinucleolar antibodies (ANoA) of the IgG class which reacted in immunoblotting with a 34-kDa nucleolar protein identified as fibrillarin. The titre of ANoA attained after 10 weeks' treatment varied from 1:1,280 to 1:20,480 in the order: A.SW > SJL > > B10.S. Following cessation of HgCl2 treatment ANoA and antifibrillarin antibodies (AFA) persisted for up to 12 months, although some B10.S mice showed pronounced reduction not only of their autoantibody titres, but also systemic immune deposits when compared to other H-2s strains. A second set of autoantibodies targeted chromatin and in some mice specifically histones, and were distinguished from the ANoA by a rapid decline after treatment and a susceptibility linked to the non-H-2 genes of the SJL. Tissue levels of mercury remained elevated above untreated controls throughout the study period, suggesting that the mercury detected in lymphoid tissues may provide stimulation of lymphoid cells specific for fibrillarin for a considerable period after exposure has ceased. We conclude that H-2 as well as non-H-2 genetic factors distinctly influence not only the susceptibility to induction of autoimmunity, but also the specificity and magnitude of the response.
The cardiovascular effects of carbamazepine are well-known but left ventricular dysfunction is rarely reported.
We describe 2 cases of severe carbamazepine-associated left ventricular dysfunction during massive self intoxications in young patients without preexistent cardiac disease. We compare our cases to the available literature and discuss the mechanisms implied in the development of left ventricular dysfunction following carbamazepine overdose. Bedside echocardiography was useful in both diagnosis and treatment.
A cohort of manic-depressive patients given prophylactic lithium treatment were examined before treatment started and at intervals during treatment for up to 7 years. The mean lithium dosage was 23.2 mmol/d and the mean serum lithium concentration 0.68 mmol/l. About 40% of the patients were entirely free of side effects, as compared with 10% among patients treated previously with higher lithium doses and serum lithium concentrations. Tremor complaints were presented by 5% of the patients before and by 15% during lithium treatment. The frequency fell with continued treatment, and after a few years it was not higher than before treatment started. Tremor complaints were positively correlated with age and with the use of neuroleptics and antidepressants. The tremorigenic effects of lithium and antidepressants seemed to potentiate each other. Tremor complaints were more frequent at serum lithium levels over than under 0.7 mmol/l. Body weight increased during the first 1-2 years of lithium treatment and then remained constant. The average gain was 4 kg. Weight gain was positively correlated with the patients' body weight before treatment and with the concurrent administration of antidepressant drugs. The frequency of diarrhea complaints (loose stools, defecation urge) rose from 1% to 6% during the first 6 months of lithium treatment and then leveled off. The frequency rose steeply at serum lithium values over 0.8 mmol/l. During lithium administration about one tenth of the patients had psychological complaints, which might or might not have been caused by the treatment: memory impairment and concentrating difficulty, tiredness and "greyness of life", in a few cases altered taste or lowered libido and potency.
A cohort of manic-depressive patients given prophylactic lithium treatment were examined before treatment started and at intervals during treatment for up to 7 years. The mean lithium dosage was 23.2 mmol/d and the mean serum lithium concentration 0.68 mmol/l. The treatment did not affect glomerulus function. Urine volume rose by 10-20% and renal concentrating ability fell by 7-10% during the treatment. These changes were markedly smaller than those found in patients treated previously with higher lithium doses and serum lithium concentrations. High urine volumes and low renal concentrating abilities were not more frequent during than before lithium treatment. Complaints of increased thirst, frequent urination, and nycturia were presented more often during than before lithium treatment. Serum concentrations, urinary excretions and renal clearances of sodium and potassium were not altered by the treatment.
The Norwegian Medicines Agency has recently reported dose-dependent QT prolongation and occurrence of Torsades des pointes in patients treated with methadone; the agency recommends that an ECG is taken before induction to methadone. We have performed a literature search in Medline and Embase. QT prolongation in methadone therapy is dose-dependent and primarily seen with doses higher than those usually used in maintenance therapy and/or in cases with known risk factors. Routine ECG should not be recommended, but before starting therapy the physician should secure an adequate case history including information on any family history of cardiac disease and other risk factors. ECG is recommended when doses higher than 130 mg/day are used or the serum concentration level exceeds 1200 nmol/l. QTc prolongation above 470 msek should be reported to the authors.
The effect of thiaton [3-(di-2-thienylmethylene)-5-methyl-trans-quinolizidinium bromide], an antispasmodic drug, on indomethacin-induced intestinal damage was examined in rats. The animals were given indomethacin, s.c., and the intestinal mucosa was examined 24 h later. Thiaton or atropine was given s.c. twice, 30 min before and 8 h following indomethacin. Indomethacin caused intestinal damage, accompanied with increase in enterobacterial translocation as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and these changes were significantly prevented by supplementation with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2). Treatment of the animals with thiaton dose-dependently prevented the intestinal damage, together with the suppression of MPO and iNOS activities, and these effects were similarly observed by atropine. The increase of bacterial translocation was also significantly prevented by both thiaton and atropine, similar to dmPGE2. Indomethacin enhanced intestinal motility, and this effect was inhibited by either thiaton, atropine or dmPGE2. The intestinal mucus and fluid secretions were decreased by indomethacin but enhanced by dmPGE2. Both thiaton and atropine slightly decreased these secretions under basal conditions but significantly reversed the decrease in the secretions caused by indomethacin. These results suggest that thiaton protects the small intestine against indomethacin-induced damage and inflammatory changes, and this effect is related with prevention of enterobacterial translocation, the process being associated with inhibition of intestinal hypermotility caused by indomethacin, probably due to anti-muscarinic action.
Kidney histology of five infants who died during or immediately after treatment with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) showed severe tubular and interstitial calcinosis. We therefore studied serum concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphate, and parathormone, serum activities of alkaline phosphatase, and urinary excretion of calcium, inorganic phosphate, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in 16 other children with infantile spasms before, during, and after 6 weeks of treatment with ACTH. During the treatment the following observations were made: hypocalcaemia developed in three infants; the mean daily urinary excretion of calcium in the group increased threefold and seven infants had hypercalciuria; the excretion of phosphate increased but its tubular reabsorption remained stable; and in most infants serum parathormone and urinary cAMP excretion increased, and in four infants they increased to supranormal concentrations. These biochemical changes were reversible in most infants. Radiographs suggested loss of bone mass by 3-4 weeks of treatment, with rapid recovery after treatment. We conclude that infants treated with ACTH for infantile spasms are at risk of suffering disturbance in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, which leads to nephrocalcinosis.
We analyzed a 20 year-old patient case exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol, as probably predisposed factor in vaginal cancer. The histopathological report of the incisional biopsy was clear cell vaginal adenocarcinoma, stage III, widespread to the pelvic wall, with metastasis to regional lymph nodes, and lack of distant metastasis. We decided surgical management: protocolized laparotomy, peritoneal washing, retroperitoneal node biopsies and a radical hysterectomy, Piver III, with two thirds parts of vagina. By poor prognosis we decided to offer an adjuvant management, with systemic chemotherapy.
