HsMAD2 and BubR1 are crucial components of a functional mitotic checkpoint. Recently, impaired mitotic checkpoints or decreased expression of mitotic checkpoint genes have been associated with sensitivity to certain anticancer drugs. The current study aimed to evaluate the association of hsMAD2 and BubR1 with sensitivity to various anticancer drugs in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines. We also investigated responses to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy in ESCC patients.
HsMAD2 and BubR1 mRNA levels in six ESCC cell lines and 21 ESCC patients were determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Responses to 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, paclitaxel and docetaxel in human oesophageal cancer cell lines, TE1 and TE2, were evaluated by WST-8 colorimetric assay. HsMAD2 and BubR1 levels were compared with clinicopathological characteristics and responses to radiochemotherapy.
TE1, with lower hsMAD2 and BubR1, showed greater sensitivity to paclitaxel and docetaxel compared with TE2, with higher hsMAD2 and BubR1. HsMAD2 and BubR1 were significantly higher in cancer tissue than in adjacent normal tissue (P < 0.01). Tumoral hsMAD2 and BubR1 were significantly decreased after radiochemotherapy (P < 0.01). There was a significantly strong positive association between hsMAD2 and BubR1 in cancer tissue (P < 0.01). Neither clinicopathological characteristics nor the response to radiochemotherapy was associated with hsMAD2 or BubR1.
The mitotic checkpoint genes, hsMAD2 and BubR1, were co-ordinately overexpressed in ESCC. Low hsMAD2 and BubR1 was associated with sensitivity to paclitaxel and docetaxel. Decreased hsMAD2 and BubR1 after radiochemotherapy may indicate the potential efficacy of taxanes as second-line chemotherapy for recurrent and metastatic oesophageal cancer.
Catecholamine excess results in two distinct forms of coagulative myocytolysis, apparently due to increased membrane permeability followed by a large influx of calcium. To determine if three slow channel calcium antagonists, verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem, could reduce the calcium overload and prevent the development of noradrenaline induced acute myocardial contraction band lesions, 48 adult mongrel dogs in eight groups (n = 6) were continuously infused with saline alone, noradrenaline alone (4 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1), nifedipine (1 microgram X kg-1 X min-1), or other calcium blockers (10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) with saline or noradrenaline. After 15 minutes of pretreatment with a calcium antagonist, the antagonists were simultaneously infused with either saline or noradrenaline for 60 minutes. Nifedipine increased heart rate to the same degree as noradrenaline alone, whereas verapamil and diltiazem significantly suppressed the noradrenaline induced increases in heart rate. All three calcium antagonists reduced the increases in blood pressure and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias seen with noradrenaline alone. Only nifedipine produced a moderate increase in contractility (dP/dtmax) within 5 min and a pronounced synergistic increase when combined with noradrenaline. The effect of the other antagonists with noradrenaline was no different than the effect with noradrenaline alone. Contraction band lesions in the hearts of dogs in the saline and saline plus calcium antagonist groups were rare. The group receiving noradrenaline alone showed large numbers of the two predominant lesions: small paradiscal contraction band lesions and large holocytic contraction band lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Hindbrain and craniofacial development during early organogenesis was studied in normal and retinoic acid-exposed Macaca fascicularis embryos. 13-cis-retinoic acid impaired hindbrain segmentation as evidenced by compression of rhombomeres 1 to 5. Immunolocalization with the Hoxb-1 gene product along with quantitative measurements demonstrated that rhombomere 4 was particularly vulnerable to size reduction. Accompanying malformations of cranial neural crest cell migration patterns involved reduction and/or delay in pre- and post-otic placode crest cell populations that contribute to the pharyngeal arches and provide the developmental framework for the craniofacial region. The first and second pharyngeal arches were partially fused and the second arch was markedly reduced in size. The otocyst was delayed in development and shifted rostrolaterally relative to the hindbrain. These combined changes in the hindbrain, neural crest, and pharyngeal arches contribute to the craniofacial malformations observed in the retinoic acid malformation syndrome manifested in the macaque fetus.
Levels of circulating glucose are tightly regulated. To identify new loci influencing glycemic traits, we performed meta-analyses of 21 genome-wide association studies informative for fasting glucose, fasting insulin and indices of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to 46,186 nondiabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558 additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with fasting glucose and HOMA-B and two loci associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. These include nine loci newly associated with fasting glucose (in or near ADCY5, MADD, ADRA2A, CRY2, FADS1, GLIS3, SLC2A2, PROX1 and C2CD4B) and one influencing fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (near IGF1). We also demonstrated association of ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR and DGKB-TMEM195 with type 2 diabetes. Within these loci, likely biological candidate genes influence signal transduction, cell proliferation, development, glucose-sensing and circadian regulation. Our results demonstrate that genetic studies of glycemic traits can identify type 2 diabetes risk loci, as well as loci containing gene variants that are associated with a modest elevation in glucose levels but are not associated with overt diabetes.
Degeneration of photoreceptors is a common feature of ciliopathies, owing to the importance of the specialized ciliary structure of these cells. Mutations in AHI1, which encodes a cilium-localized protein, have been shown to cause a form of Joubert syndrome that is highly penetrant for retinal degeneration. We show that Ahi1-null mice fail to form retinal outer segments and have abnormal distribution of opsin throughout their photoreceptors. Apoptotic cell death of photoreceptors occurs rapidly between 2 and 4 weeks of age in these mice and is significantly (P = 0.00175 and 0.00613) delayed by a reduced dosage of opsin. This phenotype also shows dosage-sensitive genetic interactions with Nphp1, another ciliopathy-related gene. Although it is not a primary cause of retinal blindness in humans, we show that an allele of AHI1 is associated with a more than sevenfold increase in relative risk of retinal degeneration within a cohort of individuals with the hereditary kidney disease nephronophthisis. Our data support context-specific roles for AHI1 as a contributor to retinopathy and show that AHI1 may explain a proportion of the variability in retinal phenotypes observed in nephronophthisis.
Given the heterogeneous nature of metabolic dysfunctions associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), a single pharmaceutical cannot be expected to provide complication-free therapy in all patients. Thiazolidinediones (TZD) increase insulin sensitivity, reduce blood glucose and improve cardiovascular parameters. However, in addition to increasing fat mass, TZD have the potential in certain individuals to exacerbate underlying hepatosteatosis and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Pharmacogenetics should allow patient selection to maximize therapy and minimize risk. To this end, we have combined two genetically diverse inbred strains, NON/Lt and NZO/Lt, to produce a "negative heterosis" increasing the frequency of T2D in F1 males. As in humans with T2D, treatment of diabetic and hyperlipemic F1 males with rosiglitazone (Rosi), an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma receptor (PPARgamma), reverses these disease phenotypes. However, the hybrid genome perturbed both major pathways for phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis in the liver, and effected remarkable alterations in the composition of cardiolipin in heart mitochondria. These metabolic defects severely exacerbated an underlying hepatosteatosis and increased levels of the adipokine, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a risk factor for cardiovascular events. This model system demonstrates how the power of mouse genetics can be used to identify the metabolic signatures of individuals who may be prone to drug side effects.
Limited information is available regarding systemic changes in mammals associated with exposures to petroleum/hydrocarbon fuels. In this study, systemic toxicity of JP-8 jet fuel was observed in a rat inhalation model at different JP-8 fuel vapor concentrations (250, 500, or 1000 mg/m(3), for 91 days). Gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry sequencing identified the alpha-2 microglobulin protein to be elevated in rat kidney in a JP-8 dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis of kidney and lung tissue extracts revealed JP-8 dependent elevation of inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Tissue changes were observed histologically (hematoxylin and eosin staining) in liver, kidney, lung, bone marrow, and heart, and more prevalently at medium or high JP-8 vapor phase exposures (500-1000 mg/m(3)) than at low vapor phase exposure (250 mg/m(3)) or non-JP-8 controls. JP-8 fuel-induced liver alterations included dilated sinusoids, cytoplasmic clumping, and fat cell deposition. Changes to the kidneys included reduced numbers of nuclei, and cytoplasmic dumping in the lumen of proximal convoluted tubules. JP-8 dependent lung alterations were edema and dilated alveolar capillaries, which allowed clumping of red blood cells (RBCs). Changes in the bone marrow in response to JP-8 included reduction of fat cells and fat globules, and cellular proliferation (RBCs, white blood cells-WBCs, and megakaryocytes). Heart tissue from JP-8 exposed animals contained increased numbers of inflammatory and fibroblast cells, as well as myofibril scarring. cDNA array analysis of heart tissue revealed a JP-8 dependent increase in atrial natriuretic peptide precursor mRNA and a decrease in voltage-gated potassium (K+) ion channel mRNA.
The modifying potential of prior administration of toxic agents was investigated in our multi-organ carcinogenesis model using male F344/DuCrj rats with the aim of assessing the link between tissue damage and initiation. Animals were administered one of four toxic agents for 8 wk, and then treated with N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 100 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), intraperitoneally (i.p.), single injection), N-methylnitrosourea (MNU, 20 mg/kg b.w., i.p., four times during wk 9 and 10), and dihydroxy-di-N-propylnitrosamine (DHPN, 0.1% in drinking water, during wk 11 and 12) for multi-organ carcinogenesis. All surviving rats were killed at the end of wk 36, and the major organs carefully examined for preneoplastic and neoplastic lesion development. Immunohistochemical demonstration of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci was also performed to facilitate quantitative assessment of liver lesion development. D-galactosamine (300 mg/kg b.w., i.p., once a week), a hepatotoxin, significantly inhibited the induction of GST-P positive foci, while 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDPM, 0.1% in diet), a bile duct proliferator which is itself a hepatocarcinogen, possessed enhancing activity. DDPM, also a goitrogen, clearly inhibited the development of follicular cell tumors in the thyroid. Uracil (3.0% in diet), which is an inducer of papillomatosis in the urinary bladder, did not exert any enhancing potential on bladder carcinogenesis. Bleomycin (2 mg/kg b.w., i.p., twice a week), which is an alveolar epithelium injuring agent, also did not modify the induction of alveolar epithelium proliferative lesions. These results indicate that prior organ injury by toxic agents does not always act to enhance sensitivity to carcinogenesis.
Psychopharmacological activities of L-6-ketopiperidine-2-carbonyl-L-leucyl-L-proline amide (RGH-2202) were compared with those of the parent peptide, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH, L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide, Pyr-His-Pro amide) in rodents. RGH-2202 caused qualitatively similar effects to TRH in a variety of tests for the activity on the central nervous system. The compound as well as TRH increased the spontaneous motor activity, enhanced the conditioned avoidance response, and antagonized the avoidance suppression by haloperidol and the sleep-inducing effect of pentorbarbital in mice. It was also efficacious against the deficits of consciousness in mice with concussive head injury and the EEG disturbance in rats with basilar artery occlusion. Besides, it antagonized the cycloheximide-or anoxia-induced amnesia and enhanced the habituation of exploratory activity in mice. Biochemically, it enhanced, like TRH, the turnover of norepinephrine and dopamine in the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum of mice and rats, and increased cyclic GMP levels in the cerebellum of rats. In spite of the global similarity between the pharmacological profiles of RGH-2202 and TRH, there were some intriguing differences between them. RGH-2202 was 2-5 times more effective than TRH in improving the deficits of active avoidance performance and retention in mice, while it was weaker than TRH in modifying the haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mice and enhancing the spinal reflexes in rats. Besides, its thyrotropin releasing activity was about 30 times less potent than that of TRH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder caused by expression of the fusion gene BCR-ABL following a chromosomal translocation in the hematopoietic stem cell. Therapeutic management of CML uses tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which block ABL-signaling and effectively kill peripheral cells with BCR-ABL. However, TKIs are not curative, and chronic use is required in order to treat CML. The primary failure for TKIs is through the development of a resistant population due to mutations in the TKI binding regions. This led us to develop the mutant coiled-coil, CC(mut2), an alternative method for BCR-ABL signaling inhibition by targeting the N-terminal oligomerization domain of BCR, necessary for ABL activation. In this article, we explore additional pathways that are important for leukemic stem cell survival in K562 cells. Using a candidate-based approach, we test the combination of CC(mut2) and inhibitors of unique secondary pathways in leukemic cells. Transformative potential was reduced following silencing of the leukemic stem cell factor Alox5 by RNA interference. Furthermore, blockade of the oncogenic protein MUC-1 by the novel peptide GO-201 yielded reductions in proliferation and increased cell death. Finally, we found that inhibiting macroautophagy using chloroquine in addition to blocking BCR-ABL signaling with the CC(mut2) was most effective in limiting cell survival and proliferation. This study has elucidated possible combination therapies for CML using novel blockade of BCR-ABL and secondary leukemia-specific pathways.
Metoclopramide hydrochloride is now commonly prescribed for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders. Over a 2-year period 18 patients with neurologic disorders induced by metoclopramide were assessed at the Parkinson's disease clinic of the Ottawa Civic Hospital. During metoclopramide therapy acute transient dystonic reactions were seen in 4 patients, and parkinsonism, which was frequently misdiagnosed and treated as classic Parkinson's disease, was seen in 12 patients. After treatment with metoclopramide was stopped, tardive dyskinesia appeared in seven patients and has persisted for up to 15 months in three patients. Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia occurred in older patients undergoing long-term therapy with metoclopramide. This experience, therefore, suggests that such treatment, especially in older patients, should be avoided.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for the management of rheumatological disorders, and as analgesics and antipyretics. Hepatotoxicity is an uncommon, but potentially lethal complication, which usually occurs within 12 weeks of starting therapy. It can occur with all NSAIDs, but appears to be more common with diclofenac and particularly sulindac. Female patients aged >50 years, with autoimmune disease, and those on other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, appear to be particularly susceptible. Liver function test abnormalities generally settle within 4-6 weeks of stopping the causative drug. However, some patients may develop acute liver failure and successful orthotopic liver transplantation may be undertaken in such patients. Recent in vitro animal studies have shown that the mechanism of diclofenac toxicity relates both to impairment of ATP synthesis by mitochondria, and to production of active metabolites, particularly n,5-dihydroxydiclofenac, which causes direct cytotoxicity. Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) has also been shown to be important in diclofenac-induced liver injury, resulting in generation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial swelling and oxidation of NADP and protein thiols. Physicians and hepatologists must be vigilant to the hepatotoxic potential of any NSAID, as increased awareness, surveillance and reporting of these events will lead to a better understanding of the risk factors and the pathophysiology of NSAID-related hepatotoxicity.
The controversies on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) appear to be gradually culminating in two divergent groups of workers. One group uses low doses of the drug administered weeklyand the other group prefers high doses, the so-called standard loading dose system or its modification. The present study reports impressions with a modified repeated protracted high dose schedule of 5-FU in 325 patients with far-advanced solid malignancies treated in Bangladesh with 20% objective and 40% subjective responses. The morbidityrate was high but the protraction and the vigilance perhaps have kept the mortality rateat 1.5%. About 14% of 120 patients with gastrointestinal metastatic cancers have survived more than 1 year and 8% beyong 2 years. Review of the literature of 5-FU reveal atendency towards better response rates with higher drug concentrations particularly in the tumor-bearing area. It is noted that some prolonged survivors are always recorded byworkers using high dose schedules but not yet by those using weekly schedules. It is imperative to wait for both short- and long-term results of the controlled trials before valid conclusions can be made.
To quantify and compare the incidence of ventricular arrhythniias associated with the use of five nonsedating antihistamines: acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, loratadine and terfenadine. The effects of age, sex, dose, duration of treatment, and the interaction with P450 inhibitor drugs were also examined.
We carried out a cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using the UK-based General Practice Research database (GPRD). The study cohort included persons aged less than 80 years old who received their first prescription for any of the five study drugs between January 1, 1992 and September 30, 1996. We estimated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias with current use of antihistamines as compared with non use.
The study cohort included 197425 persons who received 513012 prescriptions. Over the study period 18 valid cases of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias were detected. Nine occurred during the current use of any antihistamine, resulting in a crude incidence of 1.9 per 10000 person-years (95%CI: 1.0-3.6) and a relative risk of 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-11.8) as compared with non use. Astemizole presented the highest relative risk (RR= 19.0; 95%CI: 4.8-76.0) of all study drugs, while terfenadine (RR=2.1; 95%CI:0.5-8.5) was in the range of other nonsedating antihistamines. Older age was associated with a greater risk of ventricular arrhythmias (RR=7.4; 95%CI: 2.6-21.4) and seemed to increase the effect of antihistamines (RR=6.4; 95%CI: 1.7-24.8). The proportions of high dose terfenadine and the concomitant use with P450 inhibitors among current users of terfenadine were 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively over the study period with no single case of ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the presence of these two risk factors.
The use of nonsedating antihistamines increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias by a factor of four in the general population. Yet, the absolute effect is quite low requiring 57000 prescriptions, or 5300 person-years of use for one case to occur. The risk associated with terfenadine was no different from that with other nonsedating antihistamines.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a major reason for withdrawal of drugs from development as well as from the market. A major problem predicting hepatotoxicity is the lack of suitable predictive in vitro system. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is usually associated with the recruitment of immune cells to the liver accelerating an inflammatory response often initiated by activation of the Kupffer cells. In order to evaluate whether the introduction of inflammatory cells could increase the sensitivity for drug-induced cytotoxicity we developed an in vitro co-culture system based on two human cell lines; a hepatoma (Huh-7) and monocytic (THP-1) cell line. As model drugs we chose two peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) agonists, the hepatotoxic troglitazone and the non-hepatotoxic rosiglitazone. In the co-cultures, troglitazone caused an enhanced cytotoxicity as compared to single cultures of either cell line, whereas little cytotoxicity was seen after treatment with rosiglitazone. Troglitazone treatment increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and stress-related genes in both cell types, which in general was more pronounced in co-cultures than in single cell cultures. Based on these results we suggest that co-cultures of human hepatoma cells and monocytes might provide an important in vitro system for better prediction of cytotoxicity mediated by potential hepatotoxins.
CNS dysfunction, especially impaired cerebellar function, is the dose-limiting toxicity associated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside, which precludes doses of greater than 48 g/m2. Four hundred eighteen patients between the ages of 2 and 74 years with leukemia or lymphoma received 36 to 48 g/m2 cytosine arabinoside either alone or with anthracycline antibiotics, 4'-(9-acridinylamino) methane sulfon-m-anisidine (m-AMSA), or total body irradiation. In only 35 of 418 patients (8%) did severe cerebellar toxicity develop; it was irreversible or fatal in four (1%) patients. The age of the patient was a critical factor in the incidence of severe cerebellar toxicity. Patients greater than 50 years old had a statistically significant greater incidence of cerebellar toxicity compared with younger patients (26/137, 19%, v 9/281, 3%; P less than .0005, chi 2). Neither the diagnosis, disease status, sex, nor the regimen altered the incidence of severe cerebellar toxicity (when corrected for age). A second course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside, administered to 62 patients, did not increase the incidence of severe cerebellar toxicity, which occurred in five (8%) of these patients. Two of the five patients had severe toxicity with the initial course. Of the 60 patients with no antecedent cerebellar dysfunction, three (5%) had severe toxicity with the second course: one of 41 patients were less than 50 years old; two of 19 patients were greater than or equal to 50 years. Since the occurrence of severe cerebellar dysfunction is greatly affected by age, reduced doses of high-dose cytosine arabinoside should be given to patients greater than 50 years old, and methods for reducing the cerebellar toxicity should be investigated in these patients.
Neurons depend on afferent input for survival. Rats were given daily kanamycin injections from P8 to P16 to destroy hair cells, the sole afferent input to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Most SGNs die over an approximately 14-week period after deafferentation. During this period, the SGN population is heterogeneous. At any given time, some SGNs exhibit apoptotic markers--TUNEL and cytochrome c loss--whereas others appear nonapoptotic. We asked whether differences among SGNs in intracellular signaling relevant to apoptotic regulation could account for this heterogeneity. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, which reflects neurotrophic signaling, is reduced in many SGNs at P16, P23, and P32, when SGNs begin to die. In particular, nearly all apoptotic SGNs exhibit reduced phospho-CREB, implying that apoptosis is due to insufficient neurotrophic support. However, >32% of SGNs maintain high phospho-CREB levels, implying access to neurotrophic support. By P60, when approximately 50% of the SGNs have died, phospho-CREB levels in surviving neurons are not reduced, and SGN death is no longer correlated with reduced phospho-CREB. Activity in the proapoptotic Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-Jun signaling pathway is elevated in SGNs during the cell death period. This too is heterogeneous: <42% of the SGNs exhibited high phospho-Jun levels, but nearly all SGNs undergoing apoptosis exhibited elevated phospho-Jun. Thus, heterogeneity among SGNs in prosurvival and proapoptotic signaling is correlated with apoptosis. SGN death following deafferentation has an early phase in which apoptosis is correlated with reduced phospho-CREB and a later phase in which it is not. Proapoptotic JNK-Jun signaling is tightly correlated with SGN apoptosis.
It is well established that calcitonin is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption; however, a physiological role for calcitonin acting through its cognate receptor, the calcitonin receptor (CTR), has not been identified. Data from previous genetically modified animal models have recognized a possible role for calcitonin and the CTR in controlling bone formation; however, interpretation of these data are complicated, in part because of their mixed genetic background. Therefore, to elucidate the physiological role of the CTR in calcium and bone metabolism, we generated a viable global CTR knockout (KO) mouse model using the Cre/loxP system, in which the CTR is globally deleted by >94% but <100%. Global CTRKOs displayed normal serum ultrafiltrable calcium levels and a mild increase in bone formation in males, showing that the CTR plays a modest physiological role in the regulation of bone and calcium homeostasis in the basal state in mice. Furthermore, the peak in serum total calcium after calcitriol [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)]-induced hypercalcemia was substantially greater in global CTRKOs compared with controls. These data provide strong evidence for a biological role of the CTR in regulating calcium homeostasis in states of calcium stress.
The duration of the effects of single oral doses of 80 and 160 mg of propranolol was studied in 11 patients with stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris. After administration of both doses, plasma propranolol levels peaked at 2 hours in 8 of the 11 patients and thereafter declined exponentially with an average plasma half-life of 3.98 hours (range 1.4 to 4.3) after the 80 mg dose and 4.28 hours (range 1.9 to 5.4) after the 160 mg dose. There was wide interindividual variation in plasma propranolol concentration at any given time after each dose. Treadmill walking time to the onset of angina, the total duration of exercise and the total external work performed were significantly greater by 1 hour after each dose of propranolol than after placebo. This improvement in exercise tolerance persisted unchanged for 8 hours (P less than 0.001) and was still significant although less marked at 12 hours (P less than 0.05). Improvement in exercise tolerance after propranolol was associated with a significant reduction in S-T segment depression during exercise. Both at rest and during exercise, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product decreased after propranolol, and these circulatory effects persisted for 12 hours. Changes in walking time, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were similar after 80 and 160 mg of propranolol. Despite the increase in exercise duration and in total work performed after propranolol, the rate-pressure product at the onset of angina was lower after propranolol. In view of the prolonged effects of single oral doses of 80 and 160 mg of propranolol, it is suggested that administration of propranolol twice daily should be adequate in treating patients with stable angina pectoris. These studies also demonstrate that routine measurement of plasma propranolol levels is of little practical value in the management of patients with angina pectoris.
Mitral valve replacement is considered when there is severe mitral stenosis, severe mitral insufficiency or a combination of the two. Ordinarily, surgical replacement is considered only for patients who are in functional classes III or IV and do not respond to medical management. Patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis should be treated with mitral commissurotomy whenever possible. Patients selected for commissurotomy should have a pliable valve, no other major valve dysfunction, sinus rhythm, no systemic embolism and good left ventricular function. Early operation is not ordinarily required. Mitral insufficiency may require mitral valve replacement in six rather common settings: rheumatic disease, rupture of mitral chordae tendineae, postinfarction rupture of a papillary muscle, intractable infective endocarditis, floppy mitral valve and malfunction of a prosthetic valve. Rupture of mitral chordae tendineae can usually be recognized from the history, physical examination, echocardiogram and angiocardiogram. Severe left ventricular papillary muscle dysfunction is usually due to cardiac infarction, and occurs within the first 9 days of infarction. When only a papillary muscle tip is ruptured the patient may survive long enough for a mitral valve replacement. In infective endocarditis, operation is more often needed because of congestive heart failure than because of refractory infection. Evidence of mitral stenosis or insufficiency in a patient with a previously implanted prosthetic valve usually indicates an urgent need for study and early operation. Uncommon causes of mitral incompetence that may require valve replacement are endocardial fibroelastosis, Marfan's syndrome, calcified mitral anulus, osteogenesis imperfecta, methysergide-induced heart disease and carcinoid heart disease.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a key regulator of gastrointestinal, immunological, and mucosal homeostasis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the prostaglandin-producing enzyme cyclooxygenases (COXs), and can induce serious complications, such as gastrointestinal damage, with long-term treatment. Orengedokuto (OGT), a Japanese traditional herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), is effective in various animal models of enteropathy. In the present study we examined whether OGT prevents enteropathy induced by NSAIDs in mice. Ulceration in the small intestine was induced with 2 subcutaneous injections of indomethacin (20 mg/kg body weight). Orally administered OGT prevented or reduced lethality, intestinal lesions, bleeding, increased serum nitrate/nitrite levels, and reduction of mucosal PGE2 induced by indomethacin. These beneficial effects of OGT were accompanied by increased production of PGE2 and interleukin 10 by isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells; COX-2 in these cells may be a major source of PGE2 in normal intestines. These findings suggest that OGT could be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and adverse reactions to NSAIDs.
We previously demonstrated that tenuifoliside B and 3,6'-disinapoylsucrose in Polygalae Radix, the root of Polygala tenuifolia WILLDENOW, inhibited potassium cyanide (KCN)-induced hypoxia and scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice. Because both ingredients have a common sinapoyl moiety in their structure, we inferred that the sinapoyl moiety could inhibit hypoxia and memory impairment. In the present study to clarify the hypothesis, sinapic acid inhibited KCN-induced hypoxia and scopolamine-induced memory impairment as well as tenuifoliside B and 3,6'-disinapoylsucrose did. In addition, sinapic acid inhibited decompression- or bilateral carotid artery ligation-induced hypoxia (or mortality) and CO2-induced impairment in mice, and basal forebrain lesion-induced cerebral cholinergic dysfunction (decreases in acetylcholine concentration and choline acetyltransferase activity) in rats. These results, taken together, suggest the possibilities that sinapic acid is not only a very important moiety in the pharmacological activities of tenuifoliside B and 3,6'-disinapoylsucrose but also a candidate for a cerebral protective and cognition-improving medicine.
Targeted inactivation of the insulin-like hormone 3 (insl3) gene in male mice results in altered gubernacular development, disrupted testis decent, and cryptorchidism. Cryptorchidism is a fairly common human malformation, being displayed in about three males per 100 at birth, but only a small percentage can be linked directly to genetic defects. The phthalate esters (PEs) are high production volume, ubiquitous environmental chemicals, some of which when administered during sexual differentiation, induce male rat reproductive tract malformations including gubernacular agenesis. We hypothesized that phthalate-induced gubernacular lesions likely result from an inhibition of insl3 gene expression. Three phthalates, di-n-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) were administered orally to the dam on gestation day 14 through 18 (GD14-18) and the fetal testes examined on GD18 for effects on steroid hormone production and insl3 gene expression. Compared to chemicals like vinclozolin, linuron, and prochloraz that act as AR antagonists and/or inhibit fetal Leydig cell testosterone production, only the three phthalates significantly reduced both ex vivo testosterone production and insl3 gene expression when quantified by real-time rtPCR. These results provide the first demonstration of PE-induced alteration of insl3 mRNA in the fetal male rat testis.
