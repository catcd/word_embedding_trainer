Adenosine has received wide acceptance as the drug of choice for initial treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), and as a diagnostic adjunct in hemodynamically stable, wide-complex tachycardias. This report describes the successful use of adenosine for the treatment of SVT occurring after successful initial resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation, in which a high dose of the epinephrine protocol was used.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance to lamivudine has not been extensively documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. We studied the long-term incidence of HBV resistance to lamivudine in HIV-positive patients. Sixty-six HIV-HBV-coinfected patients were studied while receiving lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) as a part of antiretroviral therapy. All these patients had a detectable serum HBV DNA at the beginning of lamivudine therapy. Serum HBV DNA was quantified by molecular hybridization. Sequence analysis of the HBV polymerase was performed in patients who became resistant to lamivudine. After 2 months of lamivudine, HBV DNA became undetectable in 57 patients (86.4%, 95% CI: 75.7%-93.6%). After 2 years of lamivudine, 47% +/- 18.6% of the patients, had sustained HBV-DNA suppression. All the 22 tested patients with HBV resistance developed mutation at position 550 in the YMDD motif of the DNA polymerase. None of the following variables were associated with an increased risk of lamivudine resistance: age, associated protease inhibitor therapy, Center for Disease Control (CDC) stage C, known HIV-infection duration, serum HBV-DNA level at baseline, CD4 cell count and serum alanine transaminase levels at baseline and at HBV-replication suppression (2 months of lamivudine). Lamivudine (300 mg/d) is effective for the inhibition of HBV replication in HIV-infected patients. However, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV may occur in 20% of patients per year.
A population-based, incidence case-control study was conducted among women in upstate New York to determine whether pesticide exposure is associated with an increase in risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among women. The study involved 376 cases of NHL identified through the State Cancer Registry and 463 controls selected from the Medicare beneficiary files and state driver's license records. Information about history of farm work, history of other jobs associated with pesticide exposure, use of common household pesticide products, and potential confounding variables was obtained by telephone interview. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using an unconditional logistic regression model. The risk of NHL was doubled (OR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.21-3.71) among women who worked for at least 10 years at a farm where pesticides were reportedly used. When both farming and other types of jobs associated with pesticide exposure were combined, there was a progressive increase in risk of NHL with increasing duration of such work (p = 0.005). Overall cumulative frequency of use of household pesticide products was positively associated with risk of NHL (p = 0.004), which was most pronounced when they were applied by subjects themselves. When exposure was analyzed by type of products used, a significant association was observed for mothballs. The associations with both occupational and household pesticides were particularly elevated if exposure started in 1950-1969 and for high-grade NHL. Although the results of this case-control study suggest that exposure to pesticide products may be associated with an increased risk of NHL among women, methodologic limitations related to selection and recall bias suggest caution in inferring causation.
We report a case of emergence delirium in a 26-month-old girl after she received oral midazolam to achieve conscious sedation. This patient's clinical course is discussed. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of emergence delirium related to use of oral midazolam.
The patch test results in 8247 patients tested in the years from 1975 to 1984 at the Department of Dermatology at the University of Graz were evaluated and a trend analysis was performed. The most conspicuous results were: Increase of contact allergy to nickel in young women; Decrease of contact allergy to chromate; Frequent occurrence of contact allergy to 4,4-diaminodiphenylmethane.
Elevated serum progesterone levels at the end of the follicular phase in controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) leads to a poorer ongoing pregnancy rate in IVF cycles due to reduced endometrial receptivity. The objective of this study was to use microarray technology to compare endometrial gene expression profiles at the window of implantation according to the levels of circulating progesterone.
For this prospective cohort study, microarray data were obtained from endometrial biopsies from 12 young healthy oocyte donors undergoing COS with pituitary suppression by either gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists, and recombinant FSH. On the day of recombinant chorionic gonadotrophin (rCG) administration, six women had serum progesterone levels (P) >1.5 ng/ml (study group) and six had serum P levels <1.5 ng/ml (control group). Endometrial samples were collected using a Pipelle catheter 7 days after the rCG injection.
Using the parametric test, we identified 140 genes significantly dysregulated (64 up- and 76 down-regulated) in the study group endometria compared with the control endometria, regardless of the GnRH analogue employed. These genes are related to cell adhesion, developmental processes, the immune system and others, which are all required for normal endometrial function development. Of the 25 gene targets previously proposed as markers for endometrial receptivity, 13 appeared over-regulated in the study group.
Our results reveal that elevated progesterone levels on the day of rCG administration can induce significant alterations in the gene expression profile of the endometrium.
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) plays a key role in the detoxification of superoxide free radicals. We evaluated the association of prostate cancer with genetic polymorphisms in SOD1 (CuZn-SOD; IVS3-251A>G), SOD2 [MnSOD; Ex2+24T>C (V16A)], and SOD3 (EC-SOD; IVS1+186C>T, Ex3-631C>G, Ex3-516C>T, and Ex3-489C>T), the three main isoforms of SOD. Prostate cancer cases (n = 1,320) from the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial were frequency matched to nondiseased controls (n = 1,842) by age, race, time since initial screening, and year of blood draw. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI); stratified analysis by the level of antioxidative vitamins was also conducted. The higher activity Ala variant at SOD2 Ex2+24T>C (V16A), which has been hypothesized to suppress prostate carcinogenesis, was associated with elevation of prostate cancer risk in Caucasians (Val/Ala versus Val/Val: OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97-1.42; Ala/Ala versus Val/Val: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03-1.60; P(trend) = 0.03). Stratification by quartiles of dietary and supplemental vitamin E intake (IU/d) showed risks of prostate cancer tended to be increased among SOD2 Ala allele carriers, except at the highest quartile of vitamin E intake (>222; P(interaction) = 0.06, Q1-Q3 versus Q4). The association between Ala allele and prostate cancer risk among those with lower intake of vitamin E (</=222) was stronger for smokers (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.10-1.90). No significant association with prostate cancer was observed for polymorphic variants in SOD3 or SOD1. These results suggest that the Ala variant of SOD2 is associated with moderately increased risk of prostate cancer, particularly among men with lower intakes of dietary and supplemental vitamin E.
To determine whether actively using, methamphetamine (meth)-dependent men who have sex with men (msm) could be enrolled and retained in a pharmacologic intervention trial, and the degree to which participants would adhere to study procedures, including medication adherence. study design: phase ii randomized, double-blind trial of bupropion vs. placebo.
Thirty meth-dependent, sexually active MSM were randomized to receive daily bupropion XL 300 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants received weekly substance use counseling, provided weekly urine specimens, and completed monthly audio-computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) behavioral risk assessments. Adherence was measured by medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) caps (the number of distinct MEMS cap openings divided by the number of expected doses) and self-report.
Ninety percent completed the trial: 89% of monthly ACASIs were completed, 81% of study visits were attended, and 81% of urine samples were collected. Adherence by MEMS cap was 60% and by self-report was 81% and did not differ significantly by treatment assignment. The median number of positive urine samples was 5.5 out of a possible 11 (50%). Participants in both arms reported similar declines in the median number of sex partners (P = 0.52). No serious adverse events occurred and there were no significant differences in adverse events by treatment assignment (P = 0.11).
It is feasible to enroll and retain actively using, meth-dependent MSM in a pharmacologic intervention. Bupropion was well tolerated. Study participation and retention rates were high, however, study drug medication adherence was only moderate. Findings support a larger trial with improved adherence support to evaluate the efficacy of bupropion and other pharmacologic interventions for meth dependence in this population.
Cyclophosphamide (CP) administration to rats in a single i.p. dose (200 mg kg-1), while producing urinary bladder toxicity and 30-40% depression of the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (MFO), failed to produce any depression of MFO activities in extrahepatic tissues such as lung, kidney and intestine. Phenobarbital pretreatment of the rats, which is known to enhance hepatic microsomal activation of CP, protected against CP-induced urinary bladder toxicity and the depression of hepatic MFO activities. This protection appears to be, at least in part, related to phenobarbital induction of hepatic cytochrome P-450 isozyme(s) that metabolizes CP to a new metabolite tentatively identified as didechlorodihydroxycyclophosphamide.
Expression of inducible heat shock protein-70 mRNA (hsp-70 mRNA) was studied in the rat brain following systemic administration of different convulsant agents: an L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel agonist, (+/-)-BAY K 8644 (BAY-K); the excitotoxic glutamate agonists kainic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA); and the GABAA receptor complex antagonists pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and lindane (gamma-hexaclorocyclohexane). BAY-K induced minimal hsp-70 mRNA expression in the hippocampus of convulsant rats, localized in the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cell layer of Ammon's horn. Kainic acid treatment in rats, showing severe limbic convulsions, caused intense expression of hsp-70 mRNA and protein (HSP-70). Expression was localized in select cerebral regions, notably the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA3 field of Ammon's horn and the piriform cortex, and also the subicular complex and the amygdala, and, to a lesser extent, the entorhinal cortex, the pyramidal cell layer of CA1, several thalamic nuclei, and the parietal cortex. In contrast, systemic administration of NMDA, PTZ or lindane led to no detectable induction of hsp-70 mRNA in the rat brain, despite producing convulsions. Histological examination revealed cell injury only following kainic acid treatment. Damage was most apparent in the piriform and entorhinal cortices, pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 field, and cortical amygdaloid nuclei. BAY-K, NMDA, PTZ and lindane did not lead to any observable histopathological changes. These results show that convulsions of different aetiology do not inevitably induce hsp-70 mRNA expression or cell damage. Intense expression of hsp-70 mRNA was generally associated with regions that later showed variable degrees of nerve cell damage, although hsp-70 mRNA expression was not always predictive of subsequent cell death or survival.
We describe a patient with Wilson's disease who presented with neurologic disease, was treated with D-penicillamine, and suffered sudden neurologic deterioration coincident with therapy. Replicate brain magnetic resonance imaging examinations after six weeks and 11 months of penicillamine therapy documented the development of new brain lesions during this period, while liver biopsy specimen data disclosed that excellent hepatic decoppering had occurred. To develop information on the relative rarity or frequency of neurologic worsening with the initiation of penicillamine therapy, we conducted a retrospective survey of 25 additional patients with Wilson's disease who met the criteria of presenting with neurologic disease and having been treated with penicillamine. The replies indicate that, at least from the patient's viewpoint, this syndrome occurs frequently. We suggest that the cause of this distressing syndrome, and ways to mitigate or circumvent it, must be discovered.
Green odor (GO), a mixture of cis-3-hexenol and trans-2-hexenal, attenuates stress responses and anxiety to psychological stressors in rodents; however, it remains unknown whether GO affects behavioral and stress responses to risk-related olfactory stimuli and actual noxious stimuli. The present study investigated the effects of green odor on behavioral and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) responses to 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a component of fox feces, and electric footshock (FS) stress. When rats were simultaneously exposed to TMT and GO, they showed decreases in immobility and plasma ACTH levels compared with TMT alone. GO exposure after TMT increased immobility, but blocked the elevation of plasma ACTH levels compared with rats exposed to distilled water after TMT. This means that GO presentation during TMT attenuated the TMT-induced behavioral response and GO presentation during and after TMT inhibited TMT-induced elevation of plasma ACTH levels. Furthermore, electric FS-induced plasma ACTH elevations were attenuated by simultaneous GO and FS exposure. GO presentation after FS attenuated plasma ACTH elevations and fecal responses. These findings reveal that GO has alleviating effects on olfactory stimulus- and noxious stimulus-induced behavioral and endocrinal responses.
The effects of ganglioside on paclitaxel induced neuropathy were studied in 15 female Wistar rats. The animals were equally divided into 3 groups based on the type of administrated drug. The first (C-group) received an intraperitoneal weekly injection of 1 ml of NSS for five weeks. The second (P-group) received 9 mg/kg of a paclitaxel intraperitoneal weekly injection for five weeks. The third (PG-group) received both ganglioside and paclitaxel. Sensory evaluation and electrophysiologic studies of the tail nerve were performed before the administration of the first dose and at the end of the experiment. Morphological evaluation of the sciatic nerve was also studied. The results revealed the mean reaction time of the tail flick test, latency, amplitude and nerve conduction velocity of the P-group in the first and seventh week were of significant difference. However, there was no significant difference detected in those of the C-group and the PG-group. There was significant difference in all parameters between the PG and P-groups but not between the PG and C-groups. Cross sections of the sciatic nerve in the P-group showed mild endoneurium edema and some degenerated axons. Small myelinated nerve fibers in the PG-group were prominent. The results of this study indicated that ganglioside treatment could produce some beneficial effects in an animal model of paclitaxel induced neuropathy.
Considerable attention has been given to the relationship between levels of fine particulate matter (particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter; PM(2.5) in the atmosphere and health effects in human populations. Since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began widespread monitoring of PM(2.5) levels in 1999, the epidemiologic community has performed numerous observational studies modeling mortality and morbidity responses to PM(2.5) levels using Poisson generalized additive models (GAMs). Although these models are useful for relating ambient PM(2.5) levels to mortality, they cannot directly measure the strength of the effect of exposure to PM(2.5) on mortality. In order to assess this effect, we propose a three-stage Bayesian hierarchical model as an alternative to the classical Poisson GAM. Fitting our model to data collected in seven North Carolina counties from 1999 through 2001, we found that an increase in PM(2.5) exposure is linked to increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in the same day and next 2 days. Specifically, a 10- microg/m3 increase in average PM(2.5) exposure is associated with a 2.5% increase in the relative risk of current-day cardiovascular mortality, a 4.0% increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality the next day, and an 11.4% increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality 2 days later. Because of the small sample size of our study, only the third effect was found to have > 95% posterior probability of being > 0. In addition, we compared the results obtained from our model to those obtained by applying frequentist (or classical, repeated sampling-based) and Bayesian versions of the classical Poisson GAM to our study population.
VEGF(165), the most abundant isoform in man, is an angiogenic cytokine that also regulates vascular permeability. Its function in the renal glomerulus, where it is expressed in visceral epithelial and mesangial cells, is unknown. To assess the role of VEGF(165) in glomerular disease, we administered a novel antagonist - a high-affinity, nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer coupled to 40-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) - to normal rats and to rats with mesangioproliferative nephritis, passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), or puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN). In normal rats, antagonism of VEGF(165) for 21 days failed to induce glomerular pathology or proteinuria. In rats with mesangioproliferative nephritis, the VEGF(165) aptamer (but not a sequence-scrambled control RNA or PEG alone) led to a reduction of glomerular endothelial regeneration and an increase in endothelial cell death, provoking an 8-fold increase in the frequency of glomerular microaneurysms by day 6. In contrast, early leukocyte influx and the proliferation, activation, and matrix accumulation of mesangial cells were not affected in these rats. In rats with PHN or PAN, administration of the VEGF(165) aptamer did not influence the course of proteinuria using various dosages and administration routes. These data identify VEGF(165) as a factor of central importance for endothelial cell survival and repair in glomerular disease, and point to a potentially novel way to influence the course of glomerular diseases characterized by endothelial cell damage, such as various glomerulonephritides, thrombotic microangiopathies, or renal transplant rejection.
Exposure to arsenic has long been known to have neurologic consequences in adults, but to date there are no well-controlled studies in children. We report results of a cross-sectional investigation of intellectual function in 201 children 10 years of age whose parents participate in our ongoing prospective cohort study examining health effects of As exposure in 12,000 residents of Araihazar, Bangladesh. Water As and manganese concentrations of tube wells at each child's home were obtained by surveying all wells in the study region. Children and mothers came to our field clinic, where children received a medical examination in which weight, height, and head circumference were measured. Children's intellectual function on tests drawn from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, version III, was assessed by summing weighted items across domains to create Verbal, Performance, and Full-Scale raw scores. Children provided urine specimens for measuring urinary As and creatinine and were asked to provide blood samples for measuring blood lead and hemoglobin concentrations. Exposure to As from drinking water was associated with reduced intellectual function after adjustment for sociodemographic covariates and water Mn. Water As was associated with reduced intellectual function, in a dose-response manner, such that children with water As levels > 50 microg/L achieved significantly lower Performance and Full-Scale scores than did children with water As levels < 5.5 microg/L. The association was generally stronger for well-water As than for urinary As.
To identify the predictors of six-month continuous abstinence among Greek smokers treated in a Smoking Cessation Clinic, emphasising the role of sleep disturbance on the outcome.
A nested case-control design was used. Patients who attended the Smoking Cessation Clinic between November 2004 and October 2005, and who completed six months of follow-up, constituted the final study population (N=285). The patients were separated into two groups - those who managed to quit smoking and those who didn't. The cessation method included pharmacotherapy, one-to- one behavioral counselling, and follow-up by telephone communication.
Among various baseline characteristics examined, multivariate regression analysis indicated that the time to first cigarette after awakening, and use of bupropion, independently predicted abstinence, while awakening during the night was negatively associated with abstinence.
These multivariate factors, which can positively or negatively affect the outcome, should be taken into account so that smoking cessation treatment can be individualised.
The goals of the current study were to determine the safety and efficacy of a nonplatinum-containing doublet, gemcitabine and docetaxel, in the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-naive nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).
Thirty-two patients with advanced, chemotherapy-naive NSCLC were treated with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) and docetaxel (40 mg/m(2)) administered on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and survival and 27 patients were evaluable for response.
This combination was extremely well tolerated with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurring in 6 of 32 patients (19%) (grading was based on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria). There were two episodes of Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and no episodes of Grade 3 or 4 anemia. Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities included nausea (occurring in 1 of 32 patients), diarrhea (occurring in 1 of 32 patients), fatigue (occurring in 10 of 32 patients), fluid retention (occurring in 2 of 32 patients), anorexia (occurring in 4 of 32 patients), and transaminitis (occurring in 2 of 32 patients). Six patients experienced Grade 3 pneumonitis that was at least possibly related to the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel. There was 1 complete response and 7 partial responses for an overall response rate of 30%. The 1-year and median survivals were 35% and 7.9 months, respectively.
In the current study, the regimen of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) and docetaxel (40 mg/m(2)) administered on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days was well tolerated with manageable hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities. The responses were comparable to those achieved with platinum-based combination chemotherapy and the 2-year survival was an encouraging 19%. These data would support the further study of this nonplatinum doublet in patients with advanced NSCLC.
Carbon monoxide (CO) liberated by a water-soluble carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM-3) induces a positive inotropic effect with a negative chronotropic effect in normal rat hearts. However, the efficacy of CORM-3 under conditions of chronic cardiac insufficiency is unknown. In a rat model of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, CORM-3 (20 microg/min) produced a positive inotropic effect as demonstrated by significant increases in systolic pressure (P < 0.05) and pressure derivative (dp/dt max) over time (P < 0.05). A similar dose of CO-depleted negative control (inactive CORM-3) failed to cause any change in these parameters. When the inotrope dobutamine was added at a dose of 10 microM following CORM-3, there was no additional increase in systolic pressure or dp/dt max. However, significant rises in systolic pressure and dp/dt max were observed after dobutamine administration to the hearts previously treated with inactive CORM-3. These results suggest that CORM-3 produces a positive inotropic effect in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy rat hearts, similar to that reported previously in normal hearts. The inotropic effect produced by CO in the doxorubicin cardiomyopathy heart was mimicked by a classical inotrope (dobutamine), suggesting that either a maximal inotropic effect is achieved at this dose of CORM-3 or both drugs utilize shared signaling pathways in cardiac muscle.
The effect of alpha-tocopherol pretreatment (6 mg/100 g body wt/day, orally for a period of 90 days) on mitochondrial electron transport in myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol (20 mg/100 g body wt, subcutaneously for two days) was studied in rats. A significant decrease was observed in the activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase in heart mitochondria of isoproterenol administered rats. The cytochrome content and the oxidation of succinate in state 3 and state 4 decreased significantly in the cardiac mitochondria treatment. In alpha-tocopherol pretreated rats, the activities of TCA cycle enzymes, concentration of cytochromes and the oxidation of succinate in state 3 and state 4 were retained at near normal values, following isoproterenol administration.
This report shows by light microscopy the appearance of secondary neurulation separated from primary neurulation and its developmental fate in the spinal cord of mice exposed to retinoic acid in utero. The embryos and fetuses were derived from pregnant mice (ICR strain) given 60, 40, or 0 mg/kg of retinoic acid in olive oil on day 8 of gestation orally and killed 1, 2, or 10 days later. Separation of the primary neural fold from the secondary neural tube was seen in 9- and 10-day-old embryos: the caudal part of the neuroepithelium of the primary neural fold was disarranged with non-closed posterior neuropore, and underneath it the secondary neural tissue extended caudally with abnormal notochord. At term, fetuses showed spina bifida, including myeloschisis, myelocele, and diplomyelia (diastematomyelia) with abnormal distribution of ganglionic cells. These cord lesions were located between the third lumbar and second coccygeal levels. The former two cord anomalies were associated with diplomyelia and split the dorsal and ventral portions of the spinal cord with an overlapping zone between the third lumbar and third sacral levels. These findings suggest that the separation from primary neurulation is due to the lesions in both primary neural folds and notochord induced by retinoic acid and that the spinal cord caudal to the third lumbar level originates from both neuroectoderm and mesenchyme-like cells while that caudal to the third sacral level originates from mesenchyme-like cells only.
Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in many countries. The mechanism of cell death is initiated by formation of a reactive metabolite that binds to mitochondrial proteins and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidant stress. Manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) is a critical defense enzyme located in the mitochondrial matrix. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the functional consequences of partial SOD2-deficiency (SOD2+/-) on intracellular signaling mechanisms of necrotic cell death after APAP overdose. Treatment of C57Bl/6J wild type animals with 200mg/kg APAP resulted in liver injury as indicated by elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase activities (2870±180U/L) and centrilobular necrosis at 6h. In addition, increased tissue glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels and GSSG-to-GSH ratios, delayed mitochondrial GSH recovery, and increased mitochondrial protein carbonyls and nitrotyrosine protein adducts indicated mitochondrial oxidant stress. In addition, nuclear DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay) correlated with translocation of Bax to the mitochondria and release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Furthermore, activation of c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) was documented by the mitochondrial translocation of phospho-JNK. SOD2+/- mice showed 4-fold higher ALT activities and necrosis, an enhancement of all parameters of the mitochondrial oxidant stress, more AIF release and more extensive DNA fragmentation and more prolonged JNK activation.
the impaired defense against mitochondrial superoxide formation in SOD2+/- mice prolongs JNK activation after APAP overdose and consequently further enhances the mitochondrial oxidant stress leading to exaggerated mitochondrial dysfunction, release of intermembrane proteins with nuclear DNA fragmentation and more necrosis.
Metastasis is one of the most threatening features of the oncogenic process and the main cause of cancer-related mortality. Several studies have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are critical for tumor invasion and metastasis. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), a phenolic compound of red wine, has been reported to be a natural chemopreventive agent. However, the cancer preventive effects of piceatannol (3,5,3',4'-tetrahydroxystilbene), a metabolite of resveratrol and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we report that piceatannol inhi-bits H-ras-induced MMP-2 activity and the invasive phenotype of MCF10A human breast epithelial cells harboring mutated H-ras (H-ras MCF10A cells) more effectively than resveratrol. Piceatannol attenuated the H-ras-induced phosphorylation of Akt in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas resveratrol, at the same concentrations, did not exert an inhibitory effect. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that piceatannol significantly inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and suppressed phospha-tidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) expression in the H-ras MCF10A cells. Ex vivo pull-down assays revealed that piceatannol directly bound to PI3K, inhibiting PI3K activity. Data from molecular docking suggested that piceatannol is a more tight-binding inhibitor than resveratrol due to the additional hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the backbone amide group of Val882 in the ATP-binding pocket of PI3K.
A patient with Down's syndrome and Eisenmenger's complex presented for orthopaedic surgery on the elbow under general anaesthesia. During pre-oxygenation, in order to prevent a subsequent fall in systemic vascular resistance, metaraminol 1 mg was administered intravenously. The patient immediately developed bradycardia, mild hypertension and became deeply cyanosed. His condition rapidly improved after atropine 0.6 mg was given intravenously. Following induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone and tracheal intubation facilitated by suxamethonium, anaesthesia was maintained by mechanical ventilation of the lungs with nitrous oxide and oxygen (40%) with intravenous increments of fentanyl for analgesia and pancuronium for muscle relaxation; residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine. The patient made an eventful recovery. Although general anaesthesia is tolerated by patients with Eisenmenger's complex, powerful vasoactive drugs should not be administered unless specifically indicated.
