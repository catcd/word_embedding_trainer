The classic agent for cutaneous leishmaniasis is pentavalent antimony. However, there are no reports of the efficacy of antimony versus placebo or of the efficacy of any alternative therapy versus either antimony or placebo. In the present report, the oral antifungal agent ketoconazole (600 mg/day for 28 days) was compared to a recommended regimen of intramuscular Pentostam (20 mg antimony/kg, with a maximum of 850 mg antimony/day, for 20 days) in a randomized study of the treatment of Panamanian cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis panamensis. A separate group of patients with this disease was administered placebo.
Ketoconazole clinically cured 16 of 21 (76%) patients. The lesions on nine patients healed by 1 month after therapy, and the lesions healed by 3 months after therapy on the other seven patients. Side effects were limited to a 27% incidence of mild, reversible hepatocellular enzyme elevation and an asymptomatic, reversible, approximately 70% decrease in serum testosterone in all patients. Pentostam cured 13 of 19 (68%) patients; the lesions on seven patients healed by the end of therapy, and the lesions on four other patients healed by 1 month after the end of therapy. Side effects were a 47% incidence of mild, reversible hepatocellular enzyme elevation and the morbidity due to 20 intramuscular injections in almost all patients. The placebo group of 11 patients had a 0% cure rate. By 1 month after therapy, all placebo-treated patients demonstrated new lesions or one lesion that was 23% to 875% larger than before therapy.
Both ketoconazole and Pentostam were more effective than placebo against L. braziliensis panamensis cutaneous leishmaniasis. Oral ketoconazole is comparable in efficacy to this parenteral Pentostam regimen and can be recommended as initial treatment for this disease.
Musculoskeletal complaints were the presenting symptoms in four of 44 children (9%) treated for relapsed Wilms' tumors with ifosfamide, a derivative of cyclophosphamide. Subsequent radiologic examination revealed rachitic bone and joint changes. A fifth child manifested clinical and radiographic signs of rickets after presenting with hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, and glycosuria. Recognition of a potential drug-induced Fanconi syndrome is important when managing pediatric oncology patients previously treated with ifosfamide. Early replacement therapy is recommended when proximal renal tubular abnormalities are detected to help prevent and control the severe metabolic bone disease associated with the Fanconi syndrome.
Hearing loss is an infrequently-reported consequence of recreational drug abuse. Although there are sporadic reports of hearing loss from heroin and cocaine ingested separately, there are no reports of hearing loss resulting from the combination of both drugs ingested simultaneously in the form of speedballing.
The purpose of this report is to document a case of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss associated with an episode of speedballing.
Case Report.
The subject of this report was a 40-year-old man with a 20-year history of substance abuse. Data collected included a case history, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry and acoustic reflexes, and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions.
The audiologic evaluation indicated a mild to moderate, relatively flat, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss that was worse in the right ear.
A bilateral sensorineural hearing loss involving both cochlear and neural pathology may be a rare complication of cocaine, heroin, or the combination of the two drugs.
The effects of the potassium channel inhibitor and putative botulinum toxin antagonist 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) were investigated in vitro on the contractile properties of rat diaphragm muscle. In the presence of 100 pM botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A), twitches elicited by supramaximal nerve stimulation (0.1 Hz) were reduced to approximately 10% of control in 3 hr at 37 degrees C. Addition of 3,4-DAP led to a rapid reversal of the BoNT/A-induced depression of twitch tension. In the presence of 100 microM 3,4-DAP, antagonism of the BoNT/A-induced blockade began within 30-40 sec and reached 82% of control with a half-time of 6.7 min. The beneficial effect of 3,4-DAP was well maintained and underwent little or no decrement relative to control for at least 8 hr after addition. Application of 1 microM neostigmine 1 hr after 3,4-DAP led to a further potentiation of twitch tension, but this action lasted for < 20 min. Moreover, neostigmine caused tetanic fade during repetitive stimulation. In contrast to the efficacy of the parent compound, the quaternary derivative of 3,4-DAP, 3,4-diamino-1-methyl pyridinium produced little or no twitch potentiation up to a concentration of 1 mM. The potassium channel blocker, tetraethylammonium, generated a transient potentiation followed by a sustained depression of twitch tensions. It is concluded that 3,4-DAP is of benefit in antagonizing the muscle paralysis following exposure to BoNT/A. Co-application of neostigmine or tetraethylammonium with 3,4-DAP, however, appears to confer no additional benefit.
It remains open to debate whether hyperinsulinemia leads to the development of hypertension. We addressed this issue by investigating the effect of chronic insulin infusion on blood pressure and related parameters in hypertensive fructose-fed rats. Rats were given either normal chow or a fructose-rich diet, and insulin or saline was infused through mini-pumps in the same animals for 14 days. The chronic insulin infusion exerted no effect on the blood pressure of the chow-fed rats. Fructose feeding increased the blood pressure and levels of insulin, triglyceride and fatty acid. Insulin infusion augmented the hyperinsulinemia but normalized the blood pressure and plasma lipids. Plasma angiotensin II was elevated in the fructose-fed rats, while insulin infusion left it unchanged. The expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) mRNA was doubled in both the aorta and epididymal fat of the fructose-fed rats, while that of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) was unaltered. Insulin infusion completely rectified the over-expression of the AT1R gene. Our findings indicate that chronic insulin infusion exacerbates hyperinsulinemia while normalizing blood pressure and the gene expressions of AT1R in insulin-resistant fructose-fed rats, suggesting that endogenous hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance is associated with the development of hypertension, whereas exogenous hyperinsulinemia attenuates hypertension probably due to amelioration of insulin resistance.
This case study describes the investigation of the sudden, unexpected death of a young, slightly hypertensive woman. She had a previous history pf serious hypokalemic-induced cardiac dysrhythmias associated with diuretic usage. Postmortem examination revealed no anatomic cause for her death. Her agonal plasma potassium, 5.4 mmol/L, seemed too low in light of her extreme acidosis, hypoxemia, and emergency treatment. Diuretic analysis indicated surreptitious ingestion of hydrochlorothiazide. Hypokalemia and the control of serum potassium concentration are discussed as are various modifiers of serum potassium.
A series of prostaglandin DP agonists containing a 3-oxa-15-cyclohexyl motif was synthesized and evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo biological assays. The reference compound ZK 118.182 (9beta-chloro-15-cyclohexyl-3-oxa-omega-pentanor PGF(2alpha)) is a potent full agonist at the prostaglandin DP receptor. Saturation of the 13,14 olefin affords AL-6556, which is less potent but is still a full agonist. Replacement of the 9-chlorine with a hydrogen atom or inversion of the carbon 15 stereochemistry also reduces affinity. In in vivo studies ZK 118.182 lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) upon topical application in the ocular hypertensive monkey. Ester, 1-alcohol, and selected amide prodrugs of the carboxylic acid enhance in vivo potency, presumably by increasing bioavailability. The clinical candidate AL-6598, the isopropyl ester prodrug of AL-6556, produces a maximum 53% drop in monkey IOP with a 1 microg dose (0.003% w/w) using a twice-daily dosing regime. Synthetically, AL-6598 was accessed from known intermediate 1 using a novel key sequence to install the cis allyl ether in the alpha chain, involving a selective Swern oxidative desilylation of a primary silyl ether in the presence of a secondary silyl ether. In this manner, 136 g of AL-6598 was synthesized under GMP conditions for evaluation in phase I clinical trials.
To report the occurrence of fatal acute liver failure following addition of levothyroxine to a regimen of sunitinib and acetaminophen.
A 57-year-old woman who started sunitinib treatment for relapsed metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor after imatinib failure had disease stabilization and normal liver function through 8 cycles of sunitinib 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off treatment. Her continuing medications included acetaminophen approximately 4.5 g/wk, as well as standard medications for asthma. In cycle 8, she received oral levothyroxine 50-150 microg/day for approximately 30 days to control hypothyroidism before beginning cycle 9 of sunitinib. On day 4 of cycle 9, she was hospitalized with progressively rising circulating liver enzyme levels. She died 4 days postadmission despite discontinuation of sunitinib and initiation of intensive supportive treatment. At autopsy, her liver showed severe centrilobular necrosis with moderate-to-severe steatosis and minimal parenchymal invasion by the neoplasm. Viral stains were negative.
Hepatic failure has been reported rarely in patients receiving sunitinib. Autopsy results excluded neoplastic disease progression and viral infection in the etiology of the event, and the patient may have died of the combined interaction of sunitinib, acetaminophen, and levothyroxine. Although sunitinib was not more than a possible hepatotoxin (Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) and may even have been hepatoprotective over a 48-week period against chronic intake of acetaminophen (probable hepatotoxin) by producing regional hypothyroidism within the liver, it is hypothesized that correction of the putative hepatic hypothyroidism with oral levothyroxine (possible hepatotoxin) and reinitiation of sunitinib treatment may have triggered hepatic necrosis.
Acetaminophen should be used with particular caution in patients receiving sunitinib. In sunitinib-treated patients who also require levothyroxine therapy, increased caution in restarting subsequent sunitinib treatment and discontinuation of acetaminophen, if possible, is advisable. Further evaluation of this potential interaction is warranted.
To evaluate the significance of inborn metabolic disorders of the pyrimidine degradation pathway, 450 children with unspecific neurological symptoms were comprehensively studied; 200 healthy children were recruited as controls. Uracil and thymine as well as their degradation products in urine were determined with an improved method based on reversed-phase HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and detection by multiple-reaction monitoring using stable-isotope-labelled reference compounds as internal standards. From the results of the control group we established age-related reference ranges of all pyrimidine degradation products. In the patient group, two children with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) deficiency were identified; one of these was homozygous for the exon 14-skipping mutation of the DPYD gene. In addition, two patients with high uracil, dihydrouracil and beta-ureidopropionate were found to have ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. In the urine of 9 patients, beta-alanine was markedly elevated owing to treatment with vigabatrin, an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, which interferes with beta-alanine breakdown. Four patients had exclusively high levels of beta-aminoisobutyrate (beta-AIB) due to a low activity of the D-beta-AIB-pyruvate aminotransferase, probably without clinical significance. In conclusion, quantitative investigation of pyrimidine metabolites in children with unexplained neurological symptoms, particularly epileptic seizures with or without psychomotor retardation, can be recommended as a helpful tool for diagnosis in clinical practice. Sensitive methods and age-related reference ranges enable the detection of partial enzyme deficiencies.
Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an inductive antioxidant enzyme, can protect cells from oxidative injury to the mitochondria. The elevation of MnSOD activity in cells can effectively prevent many diseases associated with oxidative stress. Polysaccharide Krestin (PSK), a kind of protein-bound polysaccharide extracted from Coriolus versicolor, is used as an immune response modifier in anti-tumor therapy. We have previously found that PSK could alleviate the oxidative injury that oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) brought to monocytes/macrophages, and therefore had some preventive or therapeutic effect on atherosclerosis. In order to find out if the effects of PSK were associated with the alteration ofantioxidant enzymes, we investigated its effect on MnSOD activity and gene expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages. The results showed that PSK could enhance SOD activity and increase the contents ofMnSOD mRNA in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, the induction of MnSOD by PSK could be blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D.
The anticonvulsant drug, primidone, was believed to be responsible for the development of hepatic cirrhosis in a 9-year-old German Shepherd Dog with idiopathic epilepsy. Marked increases in serum alanine aminotransferase, serum alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and sulfobromophthalein retention, as well as decreases in albumin and BUN supported the diagnosis of hepatic failure. Biochemical abnormalities improved after primidone was discontinued. Previous reports indicated a poor prognosis for anticonvulsant-induced hepatic failure; however, this dog has remained stable for over a year after diagnosis and proper therapy.
Valproic acid (VPA) has been used as anticonvulsants, however, it induces hepatotoxicity such as microvesicular steatosis and necrosis in the liver. To explore the mechanisms of VPA-induced steatosis, we profiled the gene expression patterns of the mouse liver that were altered by treatment with VPA using microarray analysis. VPA was orally administered as a single dose of 100 mg/kg (low-dose) or 1000 mg/kg (high-dose) to ICR mice and the animals were killed at 6, 24, or 72 h after treatment. Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were not significantly altered in the experimental animals. However, symptoms of steatosis were observed at 72 h with low-dose and at 24 h and 72 h with high-dose. After microarray data analysis, 1910 genes were selected by two-way ANOVA (P<0.05) as VPA-responsive genes. Hierarchical clustering revealed that gene expression changes depended on the time rather than the dose of VPA treatment. Gene profiling data showed striking changes in the expression of genes associated with lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism, oncogenesis, signal transduction, and development. Functional categorization of 1156 characteristically up- and down-regulated genes (cutoff >1.5-fold) revealed that 60 genes were involved in lipid metabolism that was interconnected with biological pathways for biosynthesis of triglyceride and cholesterol, catabolism of fatty acid, and lipid transport. This gene expression profile may be associated with the known steatogenic hepatotoxicity of VPA and it may provide useful information for prediction of hepatotoxicity of unknown chemicals or new drug candidates through pattern recognition.
Epileptic negative myoclonus (ENM) has been increasingly recognized in different epilepsies, but the reasons for its appearance and prognosis remain uncertain. We report 3 patients who developed de novo, almost continuous ENM, triggered by antiepileptic drug (AED) tapering, that resolved with treatment.
Three patients aged 16, 19, and 65 years with a 13- to 36-year history of partial epilepsy were receiving a therapeutic dosage of carbamazepine or phenobarbital plus either clobazam (CLB) or valproate (VPA). None had previously had ENM. Forty-eight to 72 h after CLB or VPA withdrawal, the habitual seizures recurred. The patient also began to report repetitive postural lapses of one or more limbs that interfered with eating or writing. At this time, each patient underwent polygraphy with simultaneous surface electromyography (EMG) of deltoid, biceps, and triceps muscles and of the wrist extensor and flexor bilaterally.
In all patients, EEGs demonstrated almost continuous epileptiform discharges whose spatial distribution was similar to that observed before ENM appearance. Polygraphic recordings showed repetitive loss of postural EMG activity in one or more limbs, 100-400 ms in duration, which occurred in conjunction with the spike-waves. One milligram of clonazepam intravenously always terminated ENM status, which has not recurred in the ensuing 9-36 months.
ENM may emerge as a new type of seizure due to tapering of AED therapy. This effect is possibly related to the great activation of epileptiform activity with consequent interference with cortical activity.
A case of organophosphorous poisoning in a 29 year old male who developed intermediate syndrome manifested by features of respiratory depression as evidenced by marked weakness of the respiratory muscles, tachypnoea, and drop in oxygen saturation despite reversal of nicotinic and muscarinic effects of organophosphorous poisoning. The case highlights its early recognition and prompt institution of mechanical ventilation with continuation of anticholinergic drugs. The mechanical ventilation had to be continued for 9 days with successful outcome.
The cost of genomic information has fallen steeply, but the clinical translation of genetic risk estimates remains unclear. We aimed to undertake an integrated analysis of a complete human genome in a clinical context.
We assessed a patient with a family history of vascular disease and early sudden death. Clinical assessment included analysis of this patient's full genome sequence, risk prediction for coronary artery disease, screening for causes of sudden cardiac death, and genetic counselling. Genetic analysis included the development of novel methods for the integration of whole genome and clinical risk. Disease and risk analysis focused on prediction of genetic risk of variants associated with mendelian disease, recognised drug responses, and pathogenicity for novel variants. We queried disease-specific mutation databases and pharmacogenomics databases to identify genes and mutations with known associations with disease and drug response. We estimated post-test probabilities of disease by applying likelihood ratios derived from integration of multiple common variants to age-appropriate and sex-appropriate pre-test probabilities. We also accounted for gene-environment interactions and conditionally dependent risks.
Analysis of 2.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 752 copy number variations showed increased genetic risk for myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. We discovered rare variants in three genes that are clinically associated with sudden cardiac death-TMEM43, DSP, and MYBPC3. A variant in LPA was consistent with a family history of coronary artery disease. The patient had a heterozygous null mutation in CYP2C19 suggesting probable clopidogrel resistance, several variants associated with a positive response to lipid-lowering therapy, and variants in CYP4F2 and VKORC1 that suggest he might have a low initial dosing requirement for warfarin. Many variants of uncertain importance were reported.
Although challenges remain, our results suggest that whole-genome sequencing can yield useful and clinically relevant information for individual patients.

This multicentre, observational, prospective, nonrandomized study compared the effectiveness and tolerability of quetiapine and risperidone in the acute and long-term treatment of schizophrenia in a clinical setting. Patients admitted to an acute unit with schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV), who were prescribed quetiapine or risperidone (3 : 1 ratio) within the first week of treatment, according to the physician's usual practice, were recruited. In total, 492 patients (quetiapine: 367; risperidone: 125) were followed up at weeks 1 and 2, discharge and 6 and 12 months thereafter. Mean doses at 12 months were: quetiapine 718.5 mg/day and risperidone 7.0 mg/day. Efficacy measures (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness and Improvement) indicated similar results for both agents. No difference was found in rehospitalization rate with either drug. In terms of tolerability, orthostatic hypotension was more frequent with quetiapine, but extrapyramidal symptoms and male sexual dysfunction were more frequent with risperidone. In conclusion, quetiapine and risperidone had comparable effectiveness, but there were differences between treatments in their side effect profile.
In addition to regulating blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is also involved in hepatic fibrogenesis. We aimed to investigate the effect of losartan, an angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist, on CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by a subcutaneous injection with 50% CCl4 in Sprague-Dawley rats. The amount of CCl4 administered was 1 mg/kg. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in plasma and hydroxyproline (Hyp) contents in liver tissue were assayed by spectrophotometry. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and procollagen III (PC III) were assessed by radioimmunoassay. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) levels in culture supernatants of Kupffer cells (KCs) stimulated with Ang II was determined by ELISA. Liver samples collected after 12 weeks of CCl4 treatment were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, then scored. Losartan (2.5, 5, and 10 mg x kg(-1), ig) and captopril (100 mg x kg(-1), ig) significantly decreased liver and spleen indexes, serum transaminase (AST, ALT) activities, HA and PC III levels, and Hyp contents in liver tissue in rats of hepatic fibrosis. Histopathological scores showed that losartan had an inhibitory effect on the progression of hepatic fibrosis. In in vitro experiments, losartan (1 x 10(-9) - 1 x 10(-5) M) significantly reduced TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 levels in culture supernatants of KCs, but captopril (1 x 10(-5) M) did not. The results showed that losartan significantly inhibited the progression of hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4, and the inhibitory effect of losartan on hepatic fibrosis might be associated with its ability to inhibit the production of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 by activated KCs.
Previous studies suggest that enzymes involved in the androgen metabolic pathway are susceptibility factors for prostate cancer. Estrogen metabolites functioning as genotoxins have also been proposed as risk factors. In this study, we systematically tested the hypothesis that common genetic variations for those enzymes involved in the androgen and estrogen metabolic pathways increase risk for sporadic and familial prostate cancer. From these two pathways, 46 polymorphisms (34 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 10 short tandem repeat polymorphisms, and 2 null alleles) in 25 genes were tested for possible associations. Those genes tested included PRL, LHB, CYP11A1, HSD3B1, HSD3B2, HSD17B2, CYP17, SRD5A2, AKR1C3, UGT2B15, AR, SHBG, and KLK3 from the androgen pathway and CYP19, HSD17B1, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, COMT, GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1, NQO1, ESR1, and ESR2 from the estrogen pathway. A case-control study design was used with two sets of cases: familial cases with a strong prostate cancer family history (n = 438 from 178 families) and sporadic cases with a negative prostate cancer family history (n = 499). The controls (n = 493) were derived from a population-based collection. Our results provide suggestive findings for an association with either familial or sporadic prostate cancer with polymorphisms in four genes: AKR1C3, HSD17B1, NQO1, and GSTT1. Additional suggestive findings for an association with clinical variables (disease stage, grade, and/or node status) were observed for single nucleotide polymorphisms in eight genes: HSD3B2, SRD5A2, SHBG, ESR1, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTT1, and NQO1. However, none of the findings were statistically significant after appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons. Given that the point estimates for the odds ratio for each of these polymorphisms are <2.0, much larger sample sizes will be required for confirmation.
Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS, MIM 120100), commonly known as familial cold urticaria (FCU), is an autosomal-dominant systemic inflammatory disease characterized by intermittent episodes of rash, arthralgia, fever and conjunctivitis after generalized exposure to cold. FCAS was previously mapped to a 10-cM region on chromosome 1q44 (refs. 5,6). Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS; MIM 191900), which also maps to chromosome 1q44, is an autosomal-dominant periodic fever syndrome with a similar phenotype except that symptoms are not precipitated by cold exposure and that sensorineural hearing loss is frequently also present. To identify the genes for FCAS and MWS, we screened exons in the 1q44 region for mutations by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from affected individuals and controls. This resulted in the identification of four distinct mutations in a gene that segregated with the disorder in three families with FCAS and one family with MWS. This gene, called CIAS1, is expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and encodes a protein with a pyrin domain, a nucleotide-binding site (NBS, NACHT subfamily) domain and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif region, suggesting a role in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis.
The peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase B (Thb) gene was previously identified as a direct target gene of PPARalpha, a nuclear hormone receptor activated by hypolipidemic fibrate drugs. To better understand the role of ThB in hepatic lipid metabolism in mice, Sv129 wild-type and Thb null mice were fed or not the selective PPARalpha agonist Wy14,643 (Wy). Here, it is shown that in contrast to some other mouse models deficient for peroxisomal enzymes, the hepatic PPARalpha signaling cascade in Thb null mice was normal under regular conditions. It is of interest that the hypotriglyceridemic action of Wy was reduced in Thb null mice underlining the conclusion that neither thiolase A nor SCPx/SCP2 thiolase can fully substitute for ThB in vivo. Moreover, a significant increased in the expression of lipogenic genes such as Stearoyl CoA Desaturase-1 (SCD1) was observed in Thb null mice fed Wy. Elevation of Scd1 mRNA and protein levels led to higher SCD1 activity, through a molecular mechanism that is probably SREBP1 independent. In agreement with higher SCD1, enrichment of liver mono-unsaturated fatty acids of the n-7 and n-9 series was found in Thb null mice fed Wy. Overall, we show that the reduced peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fat observed in Thb null mice fed Wy is associated with enhanced hepatic lipogenesis, through the combined elevation of microsomal SCD1 protein and activity. Ultimately, not only the amount but also the quality of the hepatic fatty acid pool is modulated upon the deletion of Thb.
A 52-year old woman developed severe cholestasis seven days after the administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (RMP-SMZ) The clinical and pathologic features are discussed as well as the various mechanisms of liver injury following TMP-SMZ use.
Ephaptic transmission is one of the electrophysiological hallmarks of hemifacial spasm. It is generally accepted that in the majority of patients with idiopathic hemifacial spasm, microvascular compression of the facial nerve at the site where the nerve exits the brain stem is the underlying cause. Whether the actual site of the ephapse is at the site of the lesion or at a nuclear level due to hyperexcitability of the facial motor nucleus is still controversial. Rarely, hemifacial spasm may be due to space occupying lesions in the cerebellopontine angle or in the brain stem. We report the electrophysiological findings of four patients with hemifacial spasm due to extra-axial tumors in different locations of the posterior fossa. The location of the tumor was intrameatal in one patient, in the cerebellopontine angle in two patients and in the brain stem in another patient. Facial nerve motor neurographies including transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed abnormal findings in two patients. Selective stimulation of facial nerve branches demonstrated delayed (ephaptic) responses in all but one patient whose hemifacial spasm had disappeared after treatment with carbamazepine. The latencies of the delayed responses did not correlate with the tumor location. In sum, the site of ephaptic transmission cannot be reliably determined by latency measurements of the delayed response because of its variability which is probably caused by the different size and diameter of the axons participating in ephaptic transmission as well as by the extent of focal demyelination at the site of the lesion. A neuroradiological work up including MR imaging should be mandatory in all patients with hemifacial spasm because electrophysiological studies fail to differentiate between idiopathic and symptomatic hemifacial spasm.
The chemical reaction of 1,4-benzoquinone with glutathione results in the formation of adducts that exhibit increasing degrees of glutathione substitution. Purification of these adducts and analysis by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the products of the reaction to be 2-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone; 2,3-(diglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone; 2,5-(diglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone; 2,6(diglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone; 2,3,5-(triglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone; and 2,3,5,6-(tetraglutatathion-S-yl)hydroquinone. The initial conjugation of 1,4-benzoquinone with glutathione did not significantly affect the oxidation potential of the compound. However, subsequent oxidation and glutathione addition resulted in the formation of conjugates that, dependent upon the position of addition, become increasingly more difficult to oxidize. Increased glutathione substitutions, which resulted in an increase in oxidation potentials, paradoxically resulted in enhanced nephrotoxicity. The triglutathion-S-yl conjugate was the most potent nephrotoxicant; the diglutathion-S-yl conjugates exhibited similar degrees of nephrotoxicity; the mono- and tetraglutathion-S-yl conjugates were not toxic. Thus, with the exception of the fully substituted isomer, the severity of renal necrosis correlated with the extent of glutathione substitution. The lack of toxicity of the fully substituted isomer is probably a consequence of its inability to alkylate tissue components. Thus, the conjugation of glutathione with quinones does not necessarily result in detoxification, even when the resulting conjugates are more stable to oxidation. The inhibition of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by AT-125 protected against 2,3,5-(triglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone-mediated nephrotoxicity. It is suggested that other extra-renal sites expressing relatively high levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase might therefore also be susceptible to hydroquinone-linked glutathione conjugate toxicity. This pathway might also contribute to the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of certain quinones.
The effects of an angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker (ARB) on focal brain ischemia and atherosclerotic lesions were explored in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoEKO) mice treated with a high-cholesterol diet (HCD). The ischemic brain area and neurological deficit 24 h after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion were significantly greater in ApoEKO mice treated with HCD for 10 weeks than in those with a normal standard diet. The reduction of cerebral surface blood flow in the penumbral region and the increase in superoxide production in the ischemic area were exaggerated in HCD-treated ApoEKO mice. Histological analysis showed atherosclerotic changes in the proximal aorta and deposition of lipid droplets in the arterial wall in the brain. Administration of an ARB, telmisartan (0.3 mg/kg/day), for the last 2 weeks after 8 weeks of HCD feeding attenuated the ischemic brain area, the neurological deficit, the superoxide production in the ischemic area, and the reduction of cerebral blood flow in the penumbra, without significantly changing blood pressure or serum cholesterol level. Telmisartan also decreased atherosclerotic lesion formation in the proximal aorta of HCD-treated ApoEKO mice, although it did not remarkably change lipid deposition in the cerebral arteries. These results suggest that the blockade of the AT(1) receptor attenuates ischemic brain damage induced in an atherosclerosis model. This inhibitory action is mediated through the attenuation of the reduction in cerebral blood flow and of oxidative stress in the brain; it also mediated through telmisartan's anti-atherosclerotic effect.
We present a case of 6-year-old boy who developed severe hyperkalaemia and ventricular tachycardia after administration of succinylcholine. Ventricular tachycardia was defibrillated and Gordon syndrome, which was diagnosed subsequently, was treated successfully. Paediatric patients with underlying metabolic disorders such as Gordon syndrome are at high risk of developing severe hyperkalaemia after succinylcholine administration.
Thyroid and parathyroid glands from normal adult sheep and sheep with vitamin D3-induced hypercalcemia were evaluated immunohistochemically for the presence of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and calcitonin (CT). Thyroid follicular cells, C-cells, and parathyroid chief cells stained moderately to strongly positive for PTHrP in both groups of sheep. C-cells were identified as cells positive for cytoplasmic staining of CT. Staining of C-cells for calcitonin in hypercalcemic sheep was diminished in intensity. The data demonstrated that PTHrP is present in the sheep thyroid and parathyroid glands. PTHrP may function as a local paracrine factor in these organs, but its staining intensity was not affected by the induction of hypercalcemia.
