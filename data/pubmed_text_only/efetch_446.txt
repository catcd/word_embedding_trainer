334 electrocardiographic recordings obtained from 109 patient who underwent cerebral angiography with low osmolality contrast media (CM) were analysed. CM used in this study included meglumine sodium ioxaglate, iopamidol, and iohexol. A tachycardial effect greater than 10% was seen in 8.3% of recordings, while a bradycardial effect greater than 10% was seen in 11.1%. Assessment was based on the type of CM used, age of the patients, usage of atropine sulfate as premedication, and the vessel injected. Patients who were under 19 years of age, and unpremedicated had a significantly higher incidence of bradycardia. On the other hand, there was no significant difference of the incidence of electrocardiographic abnormality between the three CM, and between two injected vessel groups. We have also analysed the incidence of generalized adverse effect. There was no serious complication, however, 11.9% of the patients who underwent cerebral angiography with ioxaglate developed urticaria and this was significantly higher incidence than in the other two CM groups.
A rare, but frequently fatal, side effect of the antipsychotic drug clozapine is myocarditis. We report a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to clozapine administration that was diagnosed in vivo for the first time through endomyocardial biopsy and was successfully treated with corticosteroids. Histologic diagnosis was based on the evidence of eosinophilic infiltration of the endomyocardium and eosinophil degranulation. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed in order to establish or exclude a clear-cut relationship between cardiac dysfunction and clozapine, and was crucial to establish a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Clozapine withdrawal and targeted 8-day, low-dose corticosteroid therapy resolved the symptoms and restored cardiac function.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is neoplasm which is resistant to all currently used treatment modalities including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been suggested as a novel therapeutical approach to the treatment of malignant gliomas. Here, we attempted to enhance hypericin-induced photocytotoxicity and apoptosis by diazepam, a non-selective ligand of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) which seem to play an important role in apoptosis regulation. For the study, we used U-87 MG and U373 MG glioma cell lines and primary cultures of GBM cells prepared from peroperatively obtained tumor specimens. The patients included 7 histologically confirmed GBMs. Colorimetric MTT assay was employed to study the photocytotoxic effects of hypericin and diazepam. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and assess the proapoptotic effects of diazepam. We found that hypericin upon photoactivation exerts strong cytotoxic effects against U-87 MG and U373 MG cells as well as primary GBM cell cultures. No cytotoxic effect of hypericin was observed under dark conditions. Diazepam inhibited cell growth in U-87 MG cells and primary cultures whereas proliferation of U373 MG cells remained unaffected. When hypericin was combined with diazepam, photocytotoxicity was increased in U-87 MG cells and primary cultures unlike U373 MG cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed photoactivated hypericin-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Apoptosis was significantly enhanced by diazepam in U-87 MG cells. However, no such effect was observed in U373 MG cells. In the present study, we showed that photocytotoxic effect of hypericin in glioma cells can be potentiated by diazepam. This effect is underlied by the ability of diazepam to facilitate hypericin-induced apoptosis. This work provides support to performe clinical studies involving diazepam in the antiglioma treatment regimens as an apoptosis-modulating agent.
Cadmium (Cd) exposure has been recognized to result in a wide variety of cellular responses, including oxidative stress and body weight loss. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of lycopene supplementation on the antioxidant defense system, lipid peroxidation (LPO) level, nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production, and body weight in Cd-exposed rats. Animals were divided into four groups (n = 7): control, Cd-treated, Cd plus lycopene-treated, and lycopene-treated. Cadmium (as CdCl2) was administrated orally for 20 days (6.6 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), and lycopene (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) was similarly administered. Lycopene administration significantly suppressed Cd-induced LPO in plasma and kidney homogenates. Lycopene also reversed Cd-decreased body weight compared to the control. Cadmium treatment had diverse effects on the antioxidant enzyme activities. Although antioxidant superoxide dismutase activity was unchanged, glutathione peroxidase activity was decreased, and catalase activity was elevated in kidney homogenates of Cd-administrated group. However, lycopene treatment reversed Cd-changed enzyme activities to the control level. Xanthine oxidase activity and TNF-alpha concentration were not altered by Cd administration, indicating that superoxide anion production and inflammation were not stimulated. Cadmium did not change NO levels in kidney homogenates but decreased those in plasma, and this effect was not prevented by lycopene supplementation. The result suggests that consumption of adequate levels of lycopene may be useful to prevent heavy-metal-induced LPO and body weight loss.
Carbamoylphosphate synthetase I deficiency (CPS1D) is a urea-cycle disorder characterized by episodes of life-threatening hyperammonemia. Correct diagnosis is crucial for patient management, but is difficult to make from clinical presentation and conventional laboratory tests alone. Enzymatic or genetic diagnoses have also been hampered by difficult access to the appropriate organ and the large size of the gene (38 exons). In this study, in order to address this diagnostic dilemma, we performed the largest mutational and clinical analyses of this disorder to date in Japan. Mutations in CPS1 were identified in 16 of 18 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CPS1D. In total, 25 different mutations were identified, of which 19 were novel. Interestingly, in contrast to previous reports suggesting an extremely diverse mutational spectrum, 31.8% of the mutations identified in Japanese were common to more than one family. We also identified two common polymorphisms that might be useful for simple linkage analysis in prenatal diagnosis. The accumulated clinical data will also help to reveal the clinical presentation of this rare disorder in Japan.
Contrast media are used as substances for visualization of vascular system. But, their administration is often associated with thromboembolic complications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the thrombogenic action of ionic and non-ionic contrast media on thrombus formation. The experimental destruction of endothelial cells by Laser injury leads to thrombus and emboli formation. Two ionic and two non-ionic contrast media were injected intravenously via penis vein and tested at various dosages (1.0 and 2.5 ml/kg) 5, 30, 45 and 65 minutes after injection. The administration of these contrast media decreases the number of Laser injuries required to induce thrombus formation, increases the number of emboli which detached from thrombus and prolongs duration of embolization (p < or = 0.05). These experimental results suggest that ionic and non-ionic contrast media induce thrombogenic effects. This thrombogenicity was the greatest for non-ionic contrast media. It was observed the decrease of the white cells, red cells and platelets.
Thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) have been identified as a predictor of response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Danenberg et al. developed a technology to evaluate gene expressions in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens (DTP; Danenberg tumor profile). In this study, TS and DPD gene expressions were measured in 47 primary colorectal cancer tumors and 12 metastatic tumors using FFPE specimens. In primary tumors, expression of TS genes in cancerous tissues was statistically higher than in stromal tissues, while DPD gene expressions in stromal tissues were higher than those in cancerous tissues. The median TS mRNA level was 0.86 in hepatic metastasis and 1.95 in lymph node metastasis. The median DPD mRNA level was 0.86 in hepatic metastasis and 1.96 in lymph node metastasis. Both gene expressions differed among primary tumors and metastatic tumors, especially in metastatic sites. DTP might be useful to evaluate the 2 gene expressions in colorectal cancer. Further studies would be needed to clarify the mechanisms of difference of gene expressions in cancerous and stromal tissues, or in primary tumors and metastatic tumors.
Metallothioneins (MTs) are cysteine-rich proteins that assist in cellular homeostasis and protect against oxidant injury. MTs can be induced by heavy metals and inflammatory mediators and function as free radical scavengers, reservoirs for essential heavy metals, and immunomodulators. In light of MTs' roles in responses to stress, we evaluated the in vivo effects of MT gene dose on the course of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection. LM burden was measured in livers and spleens, and flow cytometric assays were used to analyze splenocyte surface sulfhydryls, oxidative burst and apoptosis. Our results suggest that deviations from the normal complement of MT genes alter the course of LM infection. Compared to the wild-type C57BL/6J (B6-WT) strain, a congenic partner that carries a larger number of Mt1 genes (B6-MTTGN) and a congenic strain in which both Mt1 and Mt2 are disrupted (B6-MTKO) both showed lower bacterial burdens three days post-inoculation. This difference was prominent in the first 48h of infection, after which LM clearance occurred at comparable rates in all three strains. Lymphocytes from B6-MTKO mice exhibited increased cell death and increased levels of surface sulfhydryls compared to B6-WT and B6-MTTGN mice. Lymphocytes from B6-MTTGN mice had increased levels of intracellular oxidants compared to B6-WT and B6-MTKO mice. The oxidative burst by macrophages from infected B6-MTTGN and B6-MTKO mice was increased, suggesting one mechanism by which these strains might reduce the LM burden. These results indicate that MT gene dose dramatically influences host-defenses against LM infection.
The experiments with rats treated with gentamicin showed that nitrogen excretion function of the kidneys did not significantly change in the animals 3 months after induction of pyelonephritis, while in the animals not treated with the antibiotic there was a significant increase in excretion of alkaline phosphatase with urine. The nitrogen excretion function of the kidneys was not affected by gentamicin, except an increase in the urea blood level. Gentamicin promoted a significant rise in excretion of enzymes with urine, especially that of alkaline phosphatase. Treatment of healthy animals with gentamicin resulted in the increased excretion of alkaline phosphatase with urine and increased urea blood levels which was evident of the nephrotoxic effect of the aminoglycoside antibiotic. When such animals were treated with furosemide, the renal excretion of the enzyme and the blood creatinine urea levels decreased. Therefore, furosemide lowered nephropathy induced by gentamicin. The increase in the activity of the urine enzymes may be due to inflammatory changes in the kidney parenchymal on the one hand and the pephrotoxic effect of the drugs on the other hand. The urine enzymes may be used as important diagnostic tests in cases with kidney affections and indicators of safe treatment with nephrotoxic antibiotics.
Seven cases of convulsive seizure occurring after abrupt withdrawal of Lorazepam in non epileptic patients are reported. Five ot of them had an important cerebral damage occurred in perinatal period. All patients, before withdrawal, had been taking Lorazepam, 5-15 mg/day, for at least six months. It is stressed that in similar cases there is no need to start an anticonvulsive therapy because usually there is not a spontaneous recurrence of convulsive seizures. It is suggested that withdrawal of long term treatments with high doses of benzodiazepines be accomplished carefully and very slowly especially in patients with a previous cerebral damage.
Adequate patient sedation is mandatory for diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In this respect it is known that the short-acting anesthetic propofol offers certain potential advantages for sedation during ERCP, but there are no controlled studies concerning the feasibility and safety of propofol sedation in elderly, high-risk patients.
One hundred and fifty consecutive patients aged >or=80 yr with high comorbidity (ASA score >or=III: 91 %), randomly received midazolam plus meperidine (n = 75) or propofol alone (n = 75) for sedation during ERCP. Vital signs were continuously monitored and procedure-related parameters, recovery time, and quality as well as patients' cooperation and tolerance of the procedure were assessed.
Clinically relevant changes in vital signs were observed at comparable frequencies with a temporary oxygen desaturation (<90%) occurring in eight patients in the propofol-group and seven patients receiving midazolam/meperidine (n.s.). Hypotension was documented in two patients in the propofol group and one patient receiving midazolam/meperidine. Propofol provided a significantly better patient cooperation than midazolam/meperidine (p < 0.01), but the procedure tolerability was rated nearly the same by both groups. Mean recovery time was significantly shorter in the propofol group (22 +/- 7 min vs 31 +/- 8 min for midazolam/meperidine (p < 0.01)) while the recovery score was significantly higher under propofol (8.3 +/- 1.2 vs 6.1 +/- 1.1(p < 0.01)). During recovery a significant lower number of desaturation events (<90%) were observed in the propofol group (12%) than in the midazolam/meperidine group (26%, p < 0.01).
Under careful monitoring the use of propofol for sedation during ERCP is superior to midazolam/meperidine even in high-risk octogenarians.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients often complain of gastrointestinal symptoms after eating chili. However, the effect of chili ingestion on gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients has not been characterized. To study the effect of chili-containing foods on postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 20 IBS-D patients underwent gastrointestinal symptoms and postprandial colonic transit evaluations after ingesting three different meals: (i) a standard meal, (ii) a spicy meal (a standard meal mixed with 2 g chili), and (iii) a standard meal with 2 g chili in capsules, in a randomized crossover fashion. Postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms were scored every 15 min for 2 h using visual analogue scales. Thirty-eight healthy volunteers were used as controls. In healthy volunteers, the spicy meals and meals with chili capsules induced only mild abdominal burning relative to the standard meals (P < 0.05), whereas it induced significant levels of abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients (P < 0.05). Other gastrointestinal symptoms and postprandial colonic transit after spicy meals and meals with chili capsules did not differ from standard meals in IBS-D and controls (P > 0.05). Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients and controls reported similar oral burning symptoms when eating spicy meals (P > 0.05). Both the spicy meal and the standard meal with chili capsules led to similar severity of gastrointestinal symptoms (P > 0.05). Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients exhibit gut hypersensitivity to chili. Chili ingestion produced more abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients than in healthy volunteers, but was associated with similar oral burning symptoms.
There are several approaches for developing new antiallergic/antiasthmatic agents. One of them is the improvement of an existing class of effective drug classes. Due to some undesired effects of intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids, there is a need for better tolerated corticosteroids. Loteprednol etabonate belongs to the so-called class of soft steroids because it is metabolized by a one-step reaction (hydrolysis) without using the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. In in vitro investigations using human cells, loteprednol inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-5) according to its relative binding potency to the glucocorticoid receptor. In in vivo animal studies, loteprednol effectively inhibited allergically induced vascular leakage in the nasal cavity of actively sensitized Brown Norway rats and rhinorrhea in actively sensitized domestic pigs following nasal challenge. In several models of allergic asthma, it was clearly demonstrated that loteprednol was able to suppress the allergically induced late phase eosinophilia in mice, rats and guinea pigs. After intrapulmonary administration of loteprednol, only a slight, statistically nonsignificant reduction in thymus weight was observed in a dose range far less than the therapeutically relevant doses. Its therapeutic ratio is clearly superior to those of beclomethasone and budesonide. Loteprednol is a safe steroid with an extremely wide range between therapeutic and side effect inducing doses. Its elimination profile, its pronounced binding to plasma protein and erythrocytes and the low oral bioavailability makes this drug highly suitable for nasal or pulmonary use.
Fluvoxamine and paroxetine, both serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), were compared at two centers in a 7-week double-blind study in outpatients with major depression, diagnosed by DSM-III-R criteria.
Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive dosage titrated upward to between 50-150 mg/day of fluvoxamine (N = 30) or 20-50 mg/day of paroxetine (N = 30). The mean +/- SD daily dose administered at the last assessment was 102 +/- 44 mg/day for fluvoxamine and 36 +/- 13 mg/day for paroxetine. Sixteen (53%) fluvoxamine-treated patients and 10 (33%) paroxetine-treated patients were titrated to the maximum permissible dosage of either drug. Sample size was calculated to provide at least 85% power at 5% level of significance to detect at least a 1.00-point difference in mean severity of adverse events, assuming a standard deviation of 1.0.
Fluvoxamine and paroxetine were similarly effective in ameliorating depression as demonstrated by mean total scores of 10.9 +/- 7.3 (p < .00) and 11.5 +/- 7.4 (p < .00), respectively, in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity. The most common events were headache (N = 17, 57%), nausea (N = 14, 47%), sweating (N = 10, 33%), somnolence (N = 9, 30%), diarrhea (N = 9, 30%), dry mouth (N = 8, 27%), dizziness (N = 8, 27%), and, among males, impotence (N = 3, 21%) and ejaculatory abnormality (N = 3, 21%) in the paroxetine group, and headache (N = 12, 40%), somnolence (N = 12, 40%), nausea (N = 11, 37%), dry mouth (N = 11, 37%), insomnia (N = 9, 30%), asthenia (N = 7, 23%), and dyspepsia (N = 7, 23%) in the fluvoxamine group. The only statistically significant difference between treatment groups was for sweating (33% paroxetine vs. 10% fluvoxamine, p = .028).
Observed differences in some side effects, although not statistically significant, indicate that when a patient has difficulty tolerating one SSRI, the clinician may choose to change to a different agent within the same class.
We examined retrospectively the use of hydroxychloroquine in 9 patients with childhood dermatomyositis (DM). These patients had an incomplete response to corticosteroid therapy or had disease exacerbation when attempting to taper corticosteroids. They received hydroxychloroquine in a mean dosage of 3.6 mg/kg (range 2-5 mg/kg) while maintaining corticosteroid therapy. Significant improvement was noted at 3 months of therapy in rash (p less than 0.0001), proximal (p = 0.0004) and abdominal muscle strength (p = 0.0001) and at 6 months of therapy in reduced prednisone dosage (p less than 0.02). These data suggest hydroxychloroquine may be helpful in some patients with childhood DM, particularly those with prominent cutaneous disease or significant corticosteroid toxicity.
An account is given of the therapeutic experience with lithium in childhood hyperaggressivity. In 13 cases of the hospitalized 17 children between 3 and 12 years of age significant rehabilitation was achieved. Their sociability and ability to adapt themselves to the environment improved to a tolerable level. During treatment, no irreversible side effects were observed. It is recommended that the treatment should be performed either at a child psychiatric unit or by a psychiatrist with adequate experiences in this field and preferably at a hospital.
5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5azadC) inhibits DNA methyltransferase and subsequently induces the expression of genes silenced by methylation. While treatment with 5azadC downregulated hTERT and upregulated MGMT expression in two glioma cell lines, there was no change in the expression of these two genes in the normal cell line. However, cell viability was reduced as a result of 5azadC treatment in all three cell lines. 5azadC treatment reduced telomerase expression and activity and subsequently enhanced chemosensitivity towards cisplatin, taxol and tamoxifen but not with the alkylating agents temozolomide (TMZ), carmustine and chlorambucil. To further evaluate the effect of these findings, the level of hTERT and MGMT expression was measured in a recurrent anaplastic ependymoma, seven glioblastoma and two normal brain tissues. While four of eight gliomas and one of the normal tissues expressed MGMT, hTERT was expressed in all gliomas but not in the normal brain tissue. Results of this study suggest that taxol together with 5azadC may be a good therapeutic combination for glioma. In addition, the work on cell lines can be repeated on tissues utilizing hTERT as the therapeutic target for demethylation using 5azadC in glioma.
A patient is reported in whom hypercalcaemia developed when adjuvant hormonal treatment with tamoxifen (Nolvadex) was instituted. The response to withdrawal of the drug and the recurrence of hypercalcaemia on rechallenge with tamoxifen make a causal relationship between hypercalcaemia and tamoxifen therapy probable. Some of the mechanisms of development of hypercalcaemia in cases of breast carcinoma are discussed, and the literature on hypercalcaemia and tamoxifen therapy is reviewed.
The repeated misuse of highly toxic organophosphorus compound (OP) based chemical warfare agents in military conflicts and terrorist attacks poses a continuous threat to the military and civilian sector. The toxic symptomatology of OP poisoning is mainly caused by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE, E.C. 3.1.1.7) resulting in generalized cholinergic crisis due to accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in synaptic clefts. Beside atropine as competitive antagonist of ACh at muscarinic ACh receptors oximes as reactivators of OP-inhibited AChE are a mainstay of standard antidotal treatment. However, human AChE inhibited by certain OP is rather resistant to oxime-induced reactivation. The development of more effective oxime-based reactivators may fill the gaps. To get more insight into a potential structure-activity relationship between human AChE, OPs and oximes in vitro studies were conducted to investigate interactions of different tabun and sarin analogues with human AChE and the oximes obidoxime and HI 6 by determination of various kinetic constants. Rate constants for the inhibition of human AChE by OPs, spontaneous dealkylation and reactivation as well as reactivation by obidoxime and HI 6 of OP-inhibited human AChE were determined. The recorded kinetic data did not allow a general statement concerning a structure-activity relationship between human AChE, OP and oximes.
We are investigating treatments for cocaine abuse based on viral gene transfer of a cocaine hydrolase (CocH) derived from human butyrylcholinesterase, which can reduce cocaine-stimulated locomotion and cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in rats for many months. Here, in mice, we explored the possibility that anti-cocaine antibodies can complement the actions of CocH to reduce cocaine uptake in brain and block centrally-evoked locomotor stimulation. Direct injections of test proteins showed that CocH (0.3 or 1mg/kg) was effective by itself in reducing drug levels in plasma and brain of mice given cocaine (10mg/kg, s.c., or 20mg/kg, i.p). Administration of cocaine antibody per se at a low dose (8 mg/kg, i.p.) exerted little effect on cocaine distribution. However, a higher dose of antibody (12 mg/kg) caused peripheral trapping (increased plasma drug levels), which led to increased cocaine metabolism by CocH, as evidenced by a 6-fold rise in plasma benzoic acid. Behavioral tests with small doses of CocH and antibody (1 and 8 mg/kg, respectively) showed that neither agent alone reduced mouse locomotor activity triggered by a very large cocaine dose (100mg/kg, i.p.). However, dual treatment completely suppressed the locomotor stimulation. Altogether, we found cooperative and possibly synergistic actions that warrant further exploration of dual therapies for treatment of cocaine abuse.
Five cocaine-dependent individuals completed a 22-day inpatient study of sleep and cognition. Following 3 days of drug-free baseline, participants underwent 3 days of twice-daily smoked cocaine base self-administration (6 50-mg doses, 14 minutes apart), followed by 15 days of abstinence. Each morning and afternoon, the CDR repeatable, multiple-version, computerized cognitive battery (whose stability following practice has been documented) was administered. During abstinence, performance deteriorated on vigilance tasks (especially reaction time) as well as on immediate and delayed verbal recognition tasks but not on working memory tasks. Declines were most evident in the afternoon. Data suggest that abstinence can unmask cognitive deficits induced by chronic cocaine use and circadian factors may mediate their severity.
Oral opioid formulations contribute to postoperative analgesia. In this study, we evaluated the perioperative application of oral controlled-release oxycodone to reduce postoperative IV morphine consumption and opioid side effects after lumbar discectomy.
Forty patients scheduled for elective lumbar discectomy over 1 or 2 levels were included in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Every 12 h patients received either 20 mg oral controlled-release oxycodone or placebo, from the evening before surgery until the second postoperative morning. All patients received IV morphine via a morphine patient-controlled analgesia device for postoperative analgesia. Acetaminophen 1 g was administered to all patients every 6 h. Postoperative IV morphine consumption was assessed separately for T(0)-T(24) and T(24)-T(48). Postoperative assessments were conducted every 6 h for the first 48 h after surgery. Postoperative analgesia assessments included pain at rest, during coughing, and with motion, using a visual analog scale. Nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation, and bowel function were also assessed every 6 h. Patients rated their satisfaction with postoperative analgesia 72 h postoperatively.
Postoperative IV morphine consumption was significantly reduced during T(0)-T(24) (26 +/- 10 mg vs 52 +/- 29 mg) and T(24)-T(48) (13 +/- 8 mg vs 33 +/- 18 mg) in the controlled-release oxycodone group compared with that in the placebo group. Pain scores at rest, during coughing, and with motion were significantly lower during the first 48 postoperative hours in the controlled-release oxycodone group. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were significantly reduced during the first 24 h in the controlled-release oxycodone group. Lastly, the controlled-release oxycodone group also experienced significantly earlier recovery of bowel function and had higher patient satisfaction with pain therapy.
Perioperative oral controlled-release oxycodone reduces postoperative IV morphine consumption after lumbar discectomy while providing good analgesia with fewer side effects compared with placebo.
Haplotype analysis was used to refine of the DOXNPH locus, which harbors the susceptibility gene for doxorubicin (DOX; Adriamycin) nephropathy, a Mendelian form of selective podocyte injury. Analysis of haplotype structure in three strains with contrasting susceptibility (148 single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 101-kb spacing) was complementary to analysis of recombinants in 176 F2 mice. For example, haplotype analysis but not meiotic mapping could exclude the Abcc1 multidrug transporter, and this was confirmed further by phenotypic evaluation of Abcc1 null mice. Next, comparison of haplotype structure (55 single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 44-kb spacing) with phenotype in 15 inbred strains revealed a risk haplotype that was shared by susceptible strains (P = 0.00017), thereby reducing the DOXNPH region to a 1.3-Mb interval. These data demonstrate that susceptibility to DOX nephropathy represents a founder mutation in the laboratory mouse. Haplotype analysis can be used for identification of the DOXNPH gene and prediction of strain susceptibility pattern.
We determined the frequency of and risk factors for congestive heart failure following treatment for Wilms' tumor that included doxorubicin.
Flow sheets and medical records were reviewed to identify cases of congestive heart failure in a cohort of patients treated on National Wilms' Tumor Studies (NWTS)-1, -2, -3, and -4. The frequency of congestive heart failure was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A case-control study was conducted to determine the relationship among cumulative doxorubicin dose, site(s), total dose of abdominal and thoracic irradiation, sex, and the frequency of congestive heart failure.
The cumulative frequency of congestive heart failure was 4.4% at 20 years after diagnosis among patients treated initially with doxorubicin and 17.4% at 20 years after diagnosis among those treated with doxorubicin for their first or subsequent relapse of Wilms' tumor. The relative risk (RR) of congestive heart failure was increased in females (RR = 4.5; P =.004) and by cumulative doxorubicin dose (RR = 3.3/100 mg/m(2); P <.001), lung irradiation (RR = 1.6/10 Gy; P =.037), and left abdominal irradiation (RR = 1.8/10 Gy; P =.013).
We conclude that congestive heart failure is a risk of treatment with doxorubicin for Wilms' tumor. Additional follow-up of those children treated on NWTS-4 will be necessary to determine if the decrease in dose to 150 mg/m(2) significantly reduces this risk.
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is most induced by exposure of the oral epithelial cells to tobacco products such as cigarette smoke. This exposure always occurs in the presence of saliva and presumably is induced by free radicals. To explore the effects of CS on cells in the presence of saliva, we used peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and exposed them to CS, alone or in the presence of saliva. We discovered that after 80min, exposure of the lymphocytes to CS alone resulted in a time-dependent cellular loss with a survival rate of 56%, while following lymphocyte exposure to CS in the presence of saliva, less than 15% of the cells survived. This was accompanied by concomitant accumulation of cellular protein carbonyls which could be protected by the exogenous addition of uric acid or glutathione, but not by the addition of ascorbate (Asc), N-acetyl-l-cystein (NAC) or desferal (DES). Exposure of the lymphocytes to aldehydes present in CS, such as acrolein and croton-aldehyde, also resulted in the elevation of protein carbonyls, which was ameliorated primarily by the addition of glutathione. However, lymphocyte exposure to acroline in the presence of saliva did not show the same synergism in cell death observed as when the lymphocytes were exposed to CS and saliva. Thus, we postulated the existence of another mechanism and examined the role of redox active iron as an additional explanation for this synergism. In fact, it was found that in the presence of saliva and ascorbate there was a marked decrease in the lymphocyte survival rate; this was reversed by the addition of the iron chelator desferal. In light of these results, a comprehensive mechanism for the induction of oral cancer by cigarette smoke is suggested, stressing the role of a pivotal player in the process leading to oral cancer which has never been previously considered in this regard - the saliva.
Many patients with affective illness show partial or otherwise unsatisfactory responses to standard treatments, encouraging trials of combinations of pharmacologically dissimilar antidepressants.
Records of consecutive outpatients with affective disorders only partially responsive to treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) or bupropion, alone, were reviewed for changes in specific symptoms and risks of adverse events when an SRI and bupropion were combined.
Greater symptomatic improvement was found in 19 (70%) of 27 subjects during a mean +/- SD of 11 +/- 14 months of combined daily use of bupropion (243 +/- 99 mg) with an SRI (31 +/- 16 mg fluoxetine-equivalents) than with either agent alone. Adverse effect risks were similar to those associated with each monotherapy, with a > 10% incidence of sexual dysfunction (N = 11, 41%), insomnia (N = 6, 22%), anergy (N = 4, 15%), and tremor (N = 3, 11%) during combined therapy; there were no seizures.
With conservative dosing and close monitoring, combinations of SRIs with bupropion in this uncontrolled clinical series appeared to be safe and often more effective than monotherapy.
