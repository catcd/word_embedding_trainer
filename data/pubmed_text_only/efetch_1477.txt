Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress or protein misfolding and aggregation may underlie this process. Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic mechanism responsible for protein degradation and recycling of damaged proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. Autophagic dysfunction may hasten the progression of neuronal degeneration. In this study, resveratrol promoted autophagic flux and protected dopaminergic neurons against rotenone-induced apoptosis. In an in vivo PD model, rotenone induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, increased oxidation of mitochondrial proteins and promoted autophagic vesicle development in brain tissue. The natural phytoalexin resveratrol prevented rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro, and this pro-survival effect was abolished by an autophagic inhibitor. Although both rotenone and resveratrol promoted LC3-II accumulation, autophagic flux was inhibited by rotenone and augmented by resveratrol. Further, rotenone reduced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, whereas resveratrol increased HO-1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 abolished resveratrol-mediated autophagy and neuroprotection. Notably, the effects of a pharmacological inducer of HO-1 were similar to those of resveratrol, and protected against rotenone-induced cell death in an autophagy-dependent manner, validating the hypothesis of HO-1 dependent autophagy in preventing neuronal death in the in vitro PD model. Collectively, our findings suggest that resveratrol induces HO-1 expression and prevents dopaminergic cell death by regulating autophagic flux; thus protecting against rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis.
Women initiate cocaine use at a younger age and have more complications (e.g., higher rates of major or minor depression) related to cocaine use than men. It has been proposed that estrogens play an important role in these sex differences. The addictive potential of psychoactive drugs can be measured in rats via a rewarding intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure. The rate-independent method of ICSS allows researchers to assess the "pure" rewarding effect of cocaine without influence of nonspecific motor reactions. The present study aimed to estimate effects of estradiol and a combination of estradiol and cocaine on ICSS in ovariectomized female rats. 17-β-estradiol (5μg/animal/day, 2 days) produced a long-lasting gradual lowering of the thresholds for ICSS. The ability of estradiol to decrease thresholds for ICSS has never been shown previously. Combination of 17-β-estradiol and cocaine (5.0mg/kg, 5 days) produced a greater effect on ICSS thresholds than the effect of either compound alone. No tolerance or sensitization to cocaine developed during the study. Present findings suggest estradiol increases sensitivity of the brain reward system in rats, which may have an important implication in understanding sex differences in cocaine effects.
1. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of treatment with isoproterenol (ISO, 0.3 mg kg-1 day-1, s.c.) for 7 days on the vascular reactivity of rat-isolated aortic rings. Additionally, potential mechanisms underlying the changes that involved the endothelial modulation of contractility were investigated. 2. Treatment with ISO induced cardiac hypertrophy without changes in haemodynamic parameters. Aortic rings from ISO-treated rats showed an increase in the contraction response to phenylephrine (PHE) and serotonin, but did not change relaxations produced by acetylcholine or isoproterenol. Removal of the endothelium increased the responses to PHE in both groups. However, this procedure was less effective in ISO-treated as compared with control rats. Endothelial cell removal abolished the increase in the response to PHE in ISO-treated rats. The presence of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester shifted the concentration-response curve to PHE to the left in both groups of rats. However, this effect was more pronounced in the ISO group. In addition, aminoguanidine (50 microM) potentiated the actions of PHE only in the ISO group. ISO treatment increased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS protein expression in the aorta. 3. Neither losartan (10 microM) nor indomethacin (10 microM) abolished the effects of ISO on the actions of PHE. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, 150 U ml-1) and L-arginine (5 mM), but neither catalase (300 U ml-1) nor apocynin (100 microM), blocked the effect of ISO treatment. In addition, we observed an increase in superoxide anion levels as measured by ethidium bromide fluorescence and of copper and zinc superoxide dismutase protein expression in ISO-treated rats. 4. In conclusion, our data suggest that ISO treatment alters the endothelial cell-mediated modulation of the contraction to PHE in rat aorta. The increased maximal response of PHE seems to be due to an increase in superoxide anion generation, which inactivates some of the basal NO produced and counteracts NO-mediated negative modulation even in the presence of high NO production and antioxidant defence.
In a proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis, portal pressure does not decrease adequately with propranolol. These patients may benefit from another drug that may reduce portal pressure. We evaluated the role of spironolactone, alone or with propranolol, in such patients.
Patients with cirrhosis, with or without ascites, with esophageal varices and with hepatic venous pressure gradient exceeding 12 mmHg, which did not show a 20% reduction after an 80-mg oral dose of propranolol, were studied. They were allocated to receive spironolactone 100 mg orally once daily either alone (group 1, n=10) or with propranolol 40 mg orally twice daily (group 2, n=10), for 7 days, after which the hemodynamic study was repeated.
Hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased in those receiving spironolactone and propranolol (p=0.007); 5 patients in group 1 and 7 in group 2 showed a reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient by more than 20%. However, the reduction produced by spironolactone alone (20.5 [31.3]%) was not significantly different from that produced by combination therapy (30.3 [25.9]%; p=0.46).
Spironolactone in combination with propranolol achieves adequate reduction (> or = 20%) in hepatic venous pressure gradient in propranolol-resistant portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis. Spironolactone alone was also effective in some patients.
Long-term treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) is frequently associated with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias are likely due to changes in the signal transduction pathways, at the striatal level, related to pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors. We investigated whether markers of this phenomenon can also be detected peripherally. We analyzed mRNA expression for D5 (D1-like) and D3 (D2-like) receptors and levels of second messengers, such as cAMP and free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), in peripheral blood lymphocytes of PD patients with (LID+) or without LIDs (LID-). Patients with PD showed depressed [Ca2+]i rise in response to mitogen-induced activation. The defect was more pronounced in LID+ (-33% with respect to healthy controls) than in LID- patients (-20%). Peripheral blood lymphocyte levels of cAMP were decreased in both LID+ (3.8 +/- 2.9 pmol/10 cells) and LID- patients (4.2 +/- 2.4 pmol/10(6) cells), with respect to controls (6 +/- 2.6 pmol/10(6) cells). No differences were found in dopamine receptor mRNA expression. Our results demonstrate that second messenger levels are altered in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of PD patients treated with dopaminergic agents and that patients with LIDs show further alterations in the regulation of [Ca2+]i homeostasis. This may represent a distinctive trait of patients prone to develop dyskinetic movements.
The role of molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is controversial. We have performed a prospective study of the molecular behavior of 35 patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone chemotherapy in conjunction with IFN-alpha 2b.
Bcl-2 and clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements were assayed at diagnosis by PCR in lymph node and bone marrow (BM) and sequentially after treatment.
Molecular markers were detected in BM of 29 (83%) patients at diagnosis: Bcl-2 rearrangement in 20 patients (90% major breakpoint and 10% minor cluster) and clonal IgH rearrangement in 9 of 15 patients negative for Bcl-2. Molecular and clinical response was noted in 25 (86%) patients after induction treatment. Progression-free survival at 5 years was 78.1 +/- 8%. A correlation between clinical and molecular response was found in 24 patients with molecular markers in BM at diagnosis and >2 years of follow-up: 94% of patients with undetectable MRD showed continuous clinical remission, whereas 50% of patients who reverted back to positive molecular markers relapsed (P < 0.05).
The rate of molecular response is high in patients treated with cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone and IFN and MRD sequential analysis is useful for disease surveillance.
Hypoxia modulates the production of proteins involved in e.g. inflammation, angiogenesis and glucose utilization and hypoxia may therefore be an important factor underlying adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenolic compound and has been shown to have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and beneficial effects on several obesity-related complications. Thus, in the present study we investigated whether RSV has effects on hypoxic markers (GLUT-1, VEGF), hypoxia-induced key markers of inflammation (IL8, IL6), and leptin in human adipose tissue in vitro. Hypoxia was induced by incubating human adipose tissue fragments with 1% O2 for 24h as compared to 21% O2 The gene expressions were investigated by RT-PCR and protein release by Elisa. Hypoxia increases the expression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) (19-fold, p<0.001), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (10-fold, p<0.05), interleukin-8 (IL8) (8-fold, p<0.05), interleukin-6 (IL6) (5-fold, p<0.05) and leptin (9-fold). The protein levels of VEGF released to the medium was increased (8-fold, p<0.01) by hypoxia. RSV dose-dependently inhibited several of these hypoxia-induced expressions and at a concentration of 50 μM RSV almost completely inhibited the hypoxic responses at the above mentioned gene expression levels (p<0.05-p<0.001) and significantly attenuated the hypoxia-induced protein releases by 50-60%. These results demonstrate that hypoxia induces extensive changes in human adipose tissue in the expression and release of inflammation and angiogenesis-related adipokines. In addition the inhibition of hypoxia-mediated inflammation and angiogenesis might represent a novel mechanism of RSV in preventing obesity-related pathologies.
Secondary hypertension is often characterized by loss of diurnal blood pressure variability. This study examined circadian (24 h) blood pressure variability in adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH)-induced hypertension in the Sprague-Dawley rat.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to sham (0.9% saline, s.c.), n = (9), ACTH (0.5 microg/kg per day, s.c., n = 8) or ACTH (100 microg/kg per day, s.c., n = 7) in a room with a 12 h light/dark cycle (0600 h to 1800 h). A radio telemetry transducer was used to measure blood pressure in unrestrained animals over 3 control days (C1-C3) and 10 treatment days (T1-T10). Heart rate, systolic (SBP), mean arterial (MAP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were continuously recorded. Body weight was measured daily and serum corticosterone concentration ([B]) prior to death.
Sham treatment had no effect on any parameters. ACTH 100 microg/kg per day increased SBP from 124+/-2 pooled control (PC) to 134+/-2 mmHg (T10), MAP from 105+/-2 to 115+/-2 mmHg and DBP from 87+/-1 to 99+/-2 mmHg and decreased heart rate from 305+/-6 to 249+/-5 beats/min and body weight from 299+/-6 (C3) to 280+/-8 g (T10) (all P' < 0.0036). Serum [B] was higher in ACTH- (881+/-44 ng/ml) than sham-treated rats (384+/-17 ng/ml, P < 0.001). There were no differences between sham treatment and ACTH 0.5 microg/kg per day. SBP, MAP, DBP and heart rate were consistently higher for ACTH 100 microg/kg per day and sham-treated animals during the dark cycle (1800 h to 0600 h) than the light cycle (0600 h to 1800 h).
ACTH 100 microg/kg per day raises blood pressure in conscious unrestrained Sprague-Dawley rats without any change in normal diurnal rhythm.
Mercury is a well-known highly toxic metal. In this study, we characterize and investigate the cytotoxicity and its possible mechanisms of inorganic mercury in pancreatic beta-cells. Mercury chloride (HgCl2) dose-dependently decreased the function of insulin secretion and cell viability in pancreatic beta-cell-derived HIT-T15 cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets. HgCl2 significantly increased ROS formation in HIT-T15 cells. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine effectively reversed HgCl2-induced insulin secretion dysfunction in HIT-T15 cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets. Moreover, HgCl2 increased sub-G1 hypodiploids and annexin-V binding in HIT-T15 cells, indicating that HgCl2 possessed ability in apoptosis induction. HgCl2 also displayed several features of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signals including disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, increase of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activations of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase 3. Exposure of HIT-T15 cells to HgCl2 could significantly increase both apoptotic and necrotic cell populations by acridine orange/ethidium bromide dual staining. Meanwhile, HgCl2 could also trigger the depletion of intracellular ATP levels and increase the LDH release from HIT-T15 cells. These HgCl2-induced cell death-related signals could be significantly reversed by N-acetylcysteine. The intracellular mercury levels were markedly elevated in HgCl2-treated HIT-T15 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that HgCl2-induced oxidative stress causes pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and cytotoxicity involved the co-existence of apoptotic and necrotic cell death.
Tetradecylphosphocholine (TPC), hexadecylphosphocholine (HPC), hexadecylphospho(N-N-N-trimethyl)hexanolamine (HPC6), octadecylphosphocholine (OPC), and octadecyl-[2-(N-methylpiperidinio)ethyl]-phosphate (OMPEP) were investigated for antitrypanosomal activity in vitro and in vivo. OMPEP showed the best trypanocidal efficacy in vitro; it was superior to the model compound HPC and comparable to the reference compound alpha-DFMO. HPC showed moderate activity in vivo in terms of increased life expectancy (up to 35% in the acute NMRI-mouse model or 49% if combined with phenylbutazone) and increased packed cell volume, if administered daily. However, HPC and the other alkylphosphocholines failed to prolong survival time of treated mice if given intermittently. Phenylbutazone had no own trypanocidal effect but increased the efficacy of alkylphosphocholines in vitro and in vivo: the combination of HPC and phenylbutazone acted apparently synergistic.
A sensitive urinary biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI) was investigated in beagle dogs with nephrotoxicity induced by gentamicin. Gentamicin sulphate at 25 or 50 mg/kg was injected (s.c.) for 9 days, and conventional urinalysis, ELISA assay of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocal (NGAL) in urine, blood chemistry, and pathological examinations were performed. The dog given gentamicin at 25 mg/kg only showed slight deposition of lysosomal granules in the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidneys without any other significant changes even though urinary NGAL was elevated on Day 10 (day of necropsy). In the dog receiving gentamicin at 50 mg/kg, increases in urinary NGAL were observed on Days 3 and 5, and absence of urination, marked increases in serum urea nitrogen and creatinine, enlargement and discoloration of the kidneys with marked necrosis, and swelling of proximal epithelium were observed. In conclusion, urinary NGAL is considered to be a candidate as a sensitive predictable biomarker of AKI in the gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity model in dogs.
Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, is an effective agent for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To determine the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan and carboplatin, we conducted a phase II study in 61 patients with advanced NSCLC.
Every 4 weeks, the patients received irinotecan 50 mg/m2 (days 1, 8 and 15) and carboplatin (day 1) with a target AUC of 5 mg min/ml using the Chatelut formula.
All patients were evaluable for toxicity, and of 59 patients evaluable for response, 20 achieved a partial response and 26 showed no change. The overall response rate was 34% (95% confidence interval 23-48%). Grade 3 or 4 anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and diarrhea occurred in 32%, 32%, 60%, 25%, and 7%, respectively. The median survival time and 1-year, and 2-year survival rates were 10.0 months, 37.6%, and 15.2%, respectively.
Irinotecan with carboplatin is effective for advanced NSCLC and safe.
We recently reported that treatment of uremic rats with reduced renal mass with the angiotensin II (Ang II) subtype 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist losartan reduces endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in blood vessels and in glomeruli. Although this suggests an important role for Ang II in the modulation of ET-1 production, the concomitant decrease in blood pressure may also be involved. The present study was designed to investigate whether the modulation of ET-1 production in uremic rats is related to tissue-specific effects of AT1 receptor blockade or to the antihypertensive effect of losartan.
One week after renal mass reduction, uremic rats were treated with the conventional triple therapy (TRx) [reserpine (5 mg/l), hydralazine (80 mg/l) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/l)] or losartan (20 mg/kg per day) for 6 weeks. Immunoreactive-ET-1 (ir-ET-1) levels in plasma and urine, as well as in vascular and renal tissues were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay after sample extraction and purification.
Before treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in uremic animals compared to sham-operated controls (165+/-4 versus 123+/-2 mmHg, respectively; P < 0.01). Treatment with the TRx or with losartan normalized systolic blood pressure in uremic rats, whereas it was further increased in untreated uremic animals. At week 6, serum creatinine, proteinuria and urinary ET-1 and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) excretion, as well as vascular and glomerular ET-1 content were increased in uremic rats compared to the controls (P < 0.01). Treatment of uremic rats with the TRx or with losartan reduced ET-1 content in the thoracic aorta and the mesenteric arterial bed (P < 0.01). However, losartan, but not the TRx, significantly attenuated the rise of serum creatinine, proteinuria and urinary ET-1 and TGF-beta1 excretion, as well as ET-1 content in glomeruli of uremic rats. Compared with the controls, renal preproET-1 mRNA expression was also significantly higher in uremic rats. Treatment of uremic rats with losartan prevented renal preproET-1 mRNA overexpression, indicating that changes in glomerular ET-1 content and urinary ET-1 excretion were related to modulation of renal ET-1 production.
These findings indicate that the effect of losartan on ET-1 production in peripheral blood vessels may be mediated, in part, by the reduction of blood pressure. In contrast, the reduction of renal ET-1 production is mediated by tissue-specific effects of AT1 receptor blockade, and may contribute to the renal protective effects of losartan.
The susceptibility of rasH2 mice to urethane lung carcinogenesis and the modifying effects of butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) on development of pulmonary lesions were examined. Single i.p. injections of urethane at 250 mg/kg in males or 500 mg/kg in females induced alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas within 6 weeks. At 4 weeks after the injection with a dose of 1000 mg/kg, adenomas occurred in both sexes. BHT administration increased the multiplicity of hyperplasias observed 3 weeks after the urethane injection and additionally caused adenomas which did not occur in the urethane alone-treated animals. The overall data suggest the possibility of rapid assays for lung carcinogens using rasH2 mice.
We describe the case of a patient who developed reversible retrobulbar optic neuritis after intravenous pamidronate therapy for established osteoporosis. This possible complication has never been previously reported and, since our patient had a history of porphyria, it suggests that bisphosphonates should be administered cautiously in patients with this disease.
Methamphetamine is a highly addictive psychostimulant that has surged in popularity worldwide in the last decade. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophic factor family, is widely expressed in the adult mammalian brain and plays an important role in the long-term survival, differentiation, and outgrowth of neurons. Previous studies suggested that the BDNF gene may be involved in the mechanisms underlying substance dependence. This study investigated the association of the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism with methamphetamine dependence and with psychosis in a Malaysian population with different ethnicities. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was genotyped by PCR-RFLP in 186 male methamphetamine-dependent subjects and in 154 male controls of four different ethnicities, namely, Malay, Chinese, Kadazan-Dusun, and Bajau. Our results showed that the distribution of the BDNF Val66Met genotype in Chinese subjects with methamphetamine dependence (OR=2.6, p=0.015) and methamphetamine psychosis (OR=0.2, p = 0.034) were significant compared with controls. The frequency of the 66Val allele in methamphetamine-dependent subjects was higher than that in the control group, suggesting that the 66Val carriers are more susceptible to methamphetamine dependence. However, 66Val allele frequency in other ethnicities was not significantly different from the controls. The results of the study also showed that in the Chinese methamphetamine-dependent subjects, there was a difference in allele frequency when comparing those who developed psychosis and those who did not. Our findings suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may contribute to methamphetamine dependence and psychosis in the Chinese population but not in other Malaysian ethnicities.
Nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of chronic renal failure in the first 3 decades of life. Causative mutations in 8 genes (NPHP1-8) have been identified, and homologous mouse models for NPHP2/INVS and NPHP3 have been described. The jck mouse is another model of recessive cystic kidney disease, and this mouse harbors a missense mutation, G448V, in the highly conserved RCC1 domain of Nek8. We hypothesized that mutations in NEK8 might cause nephronophthisis in humans, so we performed mutational analysis in a worldwide cohort of 588 patients. We identified 3 different amino acid changes that were conserved through evolution (L330F, H425Y, and A497P) and that were absent from at least 80 ethnically matched controls. All 3 mutations were within RCC1 domains, and the mutation H425Y was positioned within the same RCC1 repeat as the mouse jck mutation. To test the functional significance of these mutations, we introduced them into full-length mouse Nek8 GFP-tagged cDNA constructs. We transiently overexpressed the constructs in inner medullary collecting duct cells (IMCD-3 cell line) and compared the subcellular localization of mutant Nek8 to wild-type Nek8. All mutant forms of Nek8 showed defects in ciliary localization to varying degrees; the H431Y mutant (human H425Y) was completely absent from cilia and the amount localized to centrosomes was decreased. Overexpression of these mutants did not affect overall ciliogenesis, mitosis, or centriole number. Our genetic and functional data support the assumption that mutations in NEK8 cause nephronophthisis (NPHP9), adding another link between proteins mutated in cystic kidney disease and their localization to cilia and centrosomes.
Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) are major metabolites of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) and are found in chlorinated drinking water. All four chlorinated compounds are liver carcinogens in B6C3F1 mice. It has previously been reported that approximately 20% of hepatic tumors induced by PCE exhibited loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 6, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene. In the current investigation, we determined whether TCA or DCA also induced LOH on chromosome 6. Liver tumors were initiated in 15 day old female B6C3F1 mice with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and promoted with 20 mmol/l DCA or TCA in their drinking water. Twenty-four and thirty-seven liver tumors promoted by DCA and TCA, respectively, were examined for LOH using 4 polymorphic loci on chromosome 6. Ten of 37 (27%) tumors (7 of 27 carcinomas and 3 of 10 adenomas) promoted by TCA exhibited LOH at least for two loci on chromosome 6. All 10 tumors that exhibited LOH, lost the C57BL/6J allele at both the D6mit9 loci, while two also lost at least one of the C3H/HeJ alleles. No LOH on chromosome 6 was observed in the 24 liver tumors promoted by DCA. The LOH on chromosome 6 in TCA but not in DCA-promoted tumors supports it as an active metabolite of PCE and demonstrates different pathogenesis at least for some of the DCA and TCA-promoted liver cancer.
We have previously observed the inhibitory effect of ferulic acid on rat tongue carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the modifying effects of a novel geranylated derivative, ethyl 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-propenoate (EGMP), synthesized from ferulic acid on tongue carcinogenesis initiated with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO).
F344 male rats except those treated with EGMP alone and untreated rats were given 20 ppm 4-NQO in drinking water for 9 weeks to induce tongue neoplasms. Starting 1 week after the cessation of exposure to 4-NQO, the experimental groups given 4-NQO and a basal diet were fed the experimental diets containing EGMP (0.2% and 2%) for 20 weeks. The activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and quinone reductase (QR), the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, polyamine content and ornithine decarboxylase activity in the tongue were examined for mechanistic analysis of modifying effects of EGMP on carcinogenesis. The expression of inducible nitric acid synthase (iNOS) was also assessed immunohistochemically.
At week 30, the incidence and multiplicity of tongue squamous cell carcinoma were significantly reduced by feeding of a 2% EGMP diet. EGMP feeding (2% in diet) elevated tongue GST activity and lowered QR activity in the tongue. Dietary EGMP decreased the expression of cell proliferation biomarker expression. Interestingly, EGMP feeding altered iNOS expression in the invasive parts of carcinoma.
These results suggest that EGMP, when given at the 2% dose level during the promotion phase, exerts a chemopreventive action against tongue tumorigenesis through modification of cell proliferation activity and/or detoxifying enzymatic activity.
Although drug induced steatosis represents a mild type of hepatotoxicity it can progress into more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Current models used for safety assessment in drug development and chemical risk assessment do not accurately predict steatosis in humans. Therefore, new models need to be developed to screen compounds for steatogenic properties. We have studied the usefulness of mouse precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) as an alternative to animal testing to gain more insight into the mechanisms involved in the steatogenesis. To this end, PCLS were incubated 24 h with the model steatogenic compounds: amiodarone (AMI), valproic acid (VA), and tetracycline (TET). Transcriptome analysis using DNA microarrays was used to identify genes and processes affected by these compounds. AMI and VA upregulated lipid metabolism, whereas processes associated with extracellular matrix remodelling and inflammation were downregulated. TET downregulated mitochondrial functions, lipid metabolism, and fibrosis. Furthermore, on the basis of the transcriptomics data it was hypothesized that all three compounds affect peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor (PPAR) signaling. Application of PPAR reporter assays classified AMI and VA as PPARγ and triple PPARα/(β/δ)/γ agonist, respectively, whereas TET had no effect on any of the PPARs. Some of the differentially expressed genes were considered as potential candidate biomarkers to identify PPAR agonists (i.e. AMI and VA) or compounds impairing mitochondrial functions (i.e. TET). Finally, comparison of our findings with publicly available transcriptomics data showed that a number of processes altered in the mouse PCLS was also affected in mouse livers and human primary hepatocytes exposed to known PPAR agonists. Thus mouse PCLS are a valuable model to identify early mechanisms of action of compounds altering lipid metabolism.
In a patient aged 34 with lymphoblastic lymphoma lymphomatous infiltrations developed in the leptomeninges but were controlled with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Recurrence of neurological signs after 7 months was recognized as relapse of lymphoma in the central nervous system, but in the brain extensive demyelination and necrotic changes were found. The authors relate the development of leucoencephalopathy to the hypersensitivity of the nervous tissue to chemotherapy after previous radiotherapy.
Paclitaxel Inj. [NK] (test; paclitaxel, CAS 33069-62-4) is a generic version of the drug from the originator (reference). Both drugs contain the same active ingredient and showed identical pharmacokinetics in patients in the previous study; however, these two drugs may have different safety profiles because they contain different inactive ingredients. Thus, in this study, peripheral neurotoxicity, one of the dose-limiting toxicities of the reference, was compared between the test and the reference in rats electrophysiologically and histopathologically. In a nerve conduction study, the amplitude of the caudal sensory nerve action potential decreased significantly after either the test or the reference administration, compared with the amplitude after saline administration, but no significant differences were observed between the two drugs. Histopathologically, apparent degeneration of the myelinated fibers in the sciatic and the sural nerves was seen after either the test or the reference injection, compared with after saline injection, but no apparent differences were observed between the two formulations. These results suggest that no significant difference in peripheral neurotoxicity exists between the test and the reference in rats.
Pain memory is thought to affect future pain sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical pain conditions. Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse. In order to address long-term pain memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin (0.05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals. Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale (0-100) digitized at 1/s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection. Subjects also recalled their pains one week later. Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose-dependent flare (p<0.001) without any difference within or across sessions. The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes. Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses (both p<0.001), regardless of whether first-time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day. Pain recall after one week was similarly precise (magnitude: p<0.01, duration: p<0.05). Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first-time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection (R(2)=0.79) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces. These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain. The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage, and may take up to one day.
The CXCR3 chemokine receptor, a member of the CXCR family, has been linked to a pathological role in autoimmune disease, inflammatory disease, allograft rejection, and ischemia. In the kidney, expression of the CXCR3 receptor and its ligands is up-regulated in states of glomerulonephritis and in allograft rejection, but little is known about the expression and functional role the CXCR3 receptor might play. Here, we study the function of the CXCR3 chemokine receptor in an immortalized human proximal tubular cell line (IHKE-1). Stimulation of the CXCR3 receptor by its selective agonist monokine induced by IFN-gamma leads via a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism to an up-regulation of early growth response gene (EGR)-1. Overexpression of EGR-1 induces down-regulation of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and manganese superoxide dismutase and stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the NADH/NADPH-oxidase system. EGR-1 overexpression or treatment with monokine induced by IFN-gamma resulted in a ROS-dependent inhibition of basolateral Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity, compromising sodium transport in these cells. Thus, activation of the CXCR3 receptor in proximal tubular cells might disturb natriuresis during inflammatory and ischemic kidney disease via EGR-1-mediated imbalance of ROS.
The treatments of mild hypertension with atenolol and prazosin in occupationally active men and women were compared in a double blind cross-over with placebo. The hypotensive effect of the beta-adreno-receptor blocking drug, atenolol, were striking and in accordance with current knowledge, using one daily dose of 100 mg. In contrast, the hypotensive effect of taking 2 mg prazosin twice a day was modest, averaging about 3% when compared with placebo, somewhat less but still detectable during the performance of muscular exercises. Atenolol medication significantly reduced heart rate and blood pressure responses to muscular exercises, covering a range of work loads experienced during ordinary working days. No increased feeling of muscular fatigue or other discomfort during muscular work compared to that on prazosin and placebo medication could be detected. It was therefore concluded that atenolol medication was a useful treatment of mild hypertension and did not reduce the normal working ability and exercise tolerance. Prazosin medication did not significantly change working ability and exercise tolerance.
