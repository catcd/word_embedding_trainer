We report a case of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) resulting from corticosteroid withdrawal. A 36-year-old woman was admitted to hospital because of an intractable headache. A neurological examination on admission showed no abnormalities other than a headache and nausea. CT, MRI, and angiogram examinations showed no abnormalities. Hematological and laboratory data were also normal. Continuous monitoring of her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure showed a value of over 25 mmHg during sleep, but papilledema was not observed. A diagnosis of BIH was made, with corticosteroid withdrawal considered to be the most probable cause. The patient was given isosorbide solution for 3 months. However, her clinical condition continued to deteriorate; she eventually began to develop visual loss, photopsia, and memory disturbances. She underwent lumboperitoneal shunt surgery, which immediately eliminated the headache, photopsia, and memory disturbances. She regained her vision over a five-month period. BIH should be considered as a differential diagnosis when an intractable headache develops after corticosteroid withdrawal, especially in young women.
The present study investigated the possible protective effect of mangiferin against D(+) galactosamine (DGal)-induced nephrotoxicity. DGal intoxication increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production and disturbed the antioxidant machineries in the kidney tissue. Mangiferin treatment post to DGal exposure reduced all these DGal-induced adverse effects. Signal transduction studies showed that DGal significantly increased the protein expression of Bax, cytochrome c, caspase 3/9 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the cytosol and NF-κB in nuclear fraction. The same exposure, on the other hand, reduced the protein expression of Bcl-2 in the cytosol. Mangiferin treatment could, however, reduce the DGal-induced up-regulation of cytochrome c, NF-κB, iNOS, caspase 3/9 and alter the reciprocal regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. Histological studies also revealed the nephroprotective effect of mangiferin against DGal induced nephrotoxicity. Combining, results suggest that mangiferin protects rat's kidney in DGal-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress and acute nephrotoxicity via its antioxidant activities.
A toxic shock syndrome occurred after a femoral nail removal requiring revision surgery. After administration of suxamethonium (1 mg.kg-1), an apnoea prolonged over 45 minutes was observed. The trachea was extubated 105 minutes after suxamethonium administration. For the nail removal, two days before, the anaesthetic had been given by the same anaesthesiologist, with a similar protocol. Apnoea extended over 20 minutes. The day of the revision surgery, plasma cholinesterase activity was 410 UI.L-1 and reached 910 UI.L-1, 9 months later. Dibucaine number was 20 and fluorure number 17. The apnoea was in relation with a genetic plasma cholinesterase deficiency increased by the toxic shock syndrome. Shock and hepatic insufficiency were suspected to contribute to the decrease in plasma cholinesterase. Suxamethonium should be avoided in case of toxic shock syndrome.
To investigate the effect of ER-34122, a novel pyrazole derivative, on 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolite production in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.
In vitro, lysate of rat basophilic leukemia cells, the microsome fraction of sheep seminal vesicles, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, human synovial cells, and human monocytes. Ex vivo and in vivo, male Balb/c mice or SD rats.
In ex vivo study, ER-34122 (0.03-1 mg/kg) was orally administered 1 h before withdrawal of blood samples. In carrageenin-induced paw edema, ER-34122 (3-100 mg/kg) and indomethacin (1-10mg/kg) were orally administered 1 h before carrageenin injection. In arachidonic acid-induced ear inflammation, ER-34122 (0.3-10mg/kg), zileuton (10-100mg/kg) and indomethacin (0.3-3mg/kg) were orally administered 1 h before arachidonic acid application.
5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and other eicosanoids were determined by using an HPLC method and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Rat hind paw edema and mouse ear edema were assessed by measuring paw volume and ear thickness, respectively. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and eicosanoid content of the ear tissue were also determined.
ER-34122 inhibited both LOX and COX product generation in vitro, and ex vivo. ER-34122 and indomethacin inhibited carrageenin-induced paw edema formation. In the arachidonic acid-induced ear inflammation, ER-34122 inhibited inflammatory responses (edema formation and MPO accumulation) as well as eicosanoids (LTB4, LTC4 and PGE2) generation. A representative LOX inhibitor, zileuton, also inhibited these inflammatory responses, while a COX inhibitor, indomethacin, did not suppress them though it completely inhibited PGE2 generation.
The anti-inflammatory characteristics of ER-34122 are considered to be superior to those of COX inhibitors such as indomethacin, because in addition to its inhibitory activity on the COX pathway, ER-34122 inhibits LOX products generation, as revealed by the inhibition of edema formation or polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration in the arachidonic acid-induced ear inflammation model.
To describe a case of QT interval prolongation, syncope, and delirium associated with galantamine use and to analyze similar cases related to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChIs) reported to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC).
An 85-year-old man with dementia was treated with prolonged release galantamine 8 mg daily for 1.5 years. Three months prior to the current admission, he had a syncopal episode with low blood pressure and bradycardia. Two months later, galantamine was withdrawn, but within 2 weeks, the man developed marked cognitive, behavioral, and functional deterioration and galantamine was restarted. Three weeks later, he developed syncope, delirium, hypotension, and prolonged QT interval with serious cardiac arrhythmias, in addition to vomiting and diarrhea. A complete blood cell count and biochemistry panel performed on admission were normal. No infection was detected. Galantamine and irbesartan were ceased. The delirium fully resolved in 6 days, and the QT interval shortened from 503 to 443 msec (corrected by Bazett's formula) 4 days after discontinuation of galantamine and remained normal.
In the ADRAC reports, galantamine was associated with 18 cases of delirium/confusion, 8 of syncope, 13 of bradycardia, 6 of other arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities, and 6 of hypotension. Donepezil was associated with 56, 15, 26, 15, and 5, and rivastigmine with 21, 8, 6, 2, and 2, respectively, of these reactions. Five fatal outcomes were reported in association with galantamine, 11 with donepezil, and 3 with rivastigmine, including 3, 6, and 0 sudden deaths, respectively. This case, along with previously published reports and cases identified from the ADRAC database, illustrates that AChIs may lead to delirium, syncope, hypotension, and life-threatening arrhythmias. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that galantamine was the probable cause of QT interval prolongation, syncope, and delirium in this patient.
Administration of galantamine and other AChIs requires vigilance and assessment of risk factors that may precipitate QT interval prolongation, syncope, and delirium.
The present study aimed to investigate the effects of tamoxifen (TMX) on locomotor behavior and on the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and creatine kinase (CK) in the brain of rats subjected to an animal model of mania induced by d-amphetamine (D-AMPH)-reversion and prevention protocols. The D-AMPH administration increased locomotor activity in saline-treated rats under prevention and reversion treatment; furthermore, there was evident reduction in the locomotion in the D-amphetamine group treated with TMX. D-AMPH significantly decreased the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in saline-treated rats in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala in both prevention and reversion treatment. Depending on the cerebral area and evaluated complex, TMX was able to prevent and reverse this impairment. A decrease in CK activity was also verified in the brain of rats when D-AMPH was administrated in both experiments; the administration of TMX reversed but not prevented the decrease in CK activity induced by D-AMPH. The present study demonstrated that TMX reversed and prevented the alterations in behavioral and energy metabolism induced by D-AMPH (alterations were also observed in bipolar disorder), reinforcing the need for more studies about inhibitors of PKC as possible targets for new medications in the treatment of bipolar disorder.
Eighty-four patients with persistent palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) of long duration were treated with either etretinate or one of three PUVA regimens. PUVA was given either with oral methoxsalen (thirteen cases), with a 1% methoxsalen cream (thirty-three cases) or with trioxsalen baths (eighteen cases). Twenty patients were treated with etretinate. Patients were assessed every fourth week. A mean score for each group was calculated at each visit based on erythema, desquamation, induration and pustulation. In addition, the number of pustules was calculated at each visit. After 12 weeks four of twenty-eight patients treated with local methoxsalen and fourteen of seventeen patients treated with etretinate had completely cleared. At this stage no patient treated with local trioxsalen or oral methoxsalen showed complete clearance.
Pituitary hypertrophy and tumors were induced in male Sprague Dawley rats using estradiol-17 beta. This tumor model generates a variety of pituitary lesions which are relevant to human pituitary disease. In order to characterize these lesions, gadolinium DTPA was injected intravenously into the tail vein of estrogen treated and control rats. High resolution T1-weighted MR images, pre- and postenhancement, were obtained at 8 different time points spanning 300 days following the subcutaneous implantation of the estrogen pellets. Images with 2-mm slice thickness were made with a 2 Telsa small-bore MR imaging system. Both normal and tumorous pituitaries were found to enhance with contrast agent, but contrast uptake was not uniform. Gd-DTPA distribution was sensitive to the different types of lesions generated in the course of this study. Digital subtraction of congruent images, pre- and postcontrast, provided difference images reflecting contrast concentration and allowed identification of subtle enhancement effects. Hypertrophic pituitaries displayed uptake of contrast, but the distribution of contrast agent was nonuniform and appeared mottled. A bright rim enhancement was often seen anterior to the pituitary gland, most likely arising from the oculomotor nerves and arachnoid. Histological slices in the same anatomical plane as the MR images were obtained on the animals allowing identification of individual lesions. Cystic areas within tumors were found to give strong contrast enhancement in less than five min postinjection. Solid and hemorrhagic areas of the pituitary tumor were hypo- to isointense relative to surrounding brain and did not take up contrast agent. Significant perfusion in these areas apparently does not occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Endometrial carcinogenesis induced by concurrent oral administration of ethylenethiourea (ETU) and sodium nitrite (NaNO2) was investigated in ICR (Crj:CD-1) female mice. A mixed solution of ETU (100 mg/kg) and NaNO2 (70 mg/kg) was given to animals orally once a week for up to 6 months and all surviving animals were killed at 12 months of study. During the study, estrous cycle was monitored by vaginal smear and five or 10 selected animals were subjected to interim killing at 3 month interval to observe time-related carcinogenic responses of the uterus. Treatment with ETU and NaNO2 resulted in development of endometrial adenocarcinomas in the uterine horn and the incidence reached 42% in the surviving animals at 12 months. Prior to the development of the tumor, atypical hyperplasia of endometrial glands was frequently observed and regarded as the precancerous lesion. Immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation revealed higher labeling indices in both hyperplastic and neoplastic endometrial glandular cells, and the index in the adenocarcinoma was more than 20% on average at any stage of the estrous cycle. Overexpression of p53 protein, which is frequently demonstrated in virulent phenotypes of human corpus cancers, was seen in three out of eight (38%) adenocarcinomas, but not in the atypical hyperplasia or normal endometrial glands. There were no treatment-related changes in the estrous cycle on vaginal smears at any interval of the study. The analyses for plasma ovarian hormones at 12 months disclosed a marked depression of progesterone in the treated animals, while the 17 beta-estradiol (E2) level was comparable to the controls. These results suggest that endometrial carcinogenesis by ETU and NaNO2 could be initiated with atypical hyperplasia of the endometrial gland and a decrease in plasma progesterone level may play an important role in the development of endometrial carcinogenesis. In addition, inactivation of the p53 gene may play a significant role in the malignant transformation of endometrial epithelial cells in mice.
Five patients received overdoses of vincristine ranging from 3.5 to 32 mg. Neurotoxicity accounted for most of the complications observed. Peripheral neuropathies, cranial nerve palsies, paralytic ileus, atony of the bladder, hypertension, hypotension, seizures, inappropriate ADH secretion, and severe bone marrow depression were all encountered. Two patients died within 72 hours of the overdose. Another patient died of sepsis 22 days after the overdose. Two patients recovered and were discharged. The three patients who survived longer than a few days showed improvement in the vincristine-induced neuropathy, and the two long-term survivors had essentially complete recovery. It appears that if a patient can be supported through the critical period following an overdose, he can be expected to recover normal neurologic function.
1. The effects of 300 microgram of oral clonidine on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations were studied in seven tetraplegic subjects with physiologically complete cervical spinal cord transections. 2. Clonidine did not significantly change resting blood pressure during the 8 h of the study. Resting heart rate fell. Resting plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations, when measured 2 h after clonidine, were not significantly lower. 3. Urinary bladder stimulation resulted in a marked rise in blood pressure accompanied by an elevation in plasma noradrenaline but not adrenaline. The hypertensive response to bladder stimulation was substantially reduced by clonidine, the maximum suppression occurring 2-4 h after administration of the drug. The plasma noradrenaline response to bladder stimulation, when measured 2 h after clonidine, was significantly lower than the response before clonidine. In two tetraplegic subjects with indwelling catheters the rise in intravesical pressure caused by bladder stimulation was unchanged by clonidine. 4. The pressor response to intravenous noradrenaline in two tetraplegic subjects and to intravenous phenylephrine in a further two tetraplegic subjects was unchanged by clonidine. 5. Clonidine may have additional antihypertensive effects which occur independently of actions in the brain. These effects may be exerted by an action either on sympathetic neurones in the spinal cord or on presynaptic alpha-adrenoreceptors in the periphery.
Drug-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis is clinically characterised by inflammation of small vessels and skin alterations, typically palpable purpura. Often the vasculitis is accompanied by fever, myalgia and malaise. All ages and sexes are equally affected. Besides the mentioned clinical features it may also present as macules, papules, vesicules, bullae, subcutaneous nodules or intermittent or chronic urticarial eruptions. Other organ systems may be affected. The patient's history is helpful in identifying the etiologic agent. If a drug is suspected as etiologic agent, a positive lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) supports the hypothesis. A 55 year old female patient developed an ANA and anti-histone antibody positive leukocytoclastic vasculitis with probable concomittant renal involvement after three weeks treatment with ibuprofen. Three months after discontinuation of the medication, the patient is without complaints and has a normal urine sedimentation and normalized immuno-autoantibodies.
Studies were undertaken to determine whether enhancement of GABAergic transmission within the substantia nigra could inhibit seizures caused by the novel, long latency convulsant, L-methionine, sulfoximine (MSO; 200 mg/kg i.p.). Bilateral injections of gamma-vinyl GABA (10 micrograms/side) into several brain sites resulted in varying degrees of protection against MSO-induced seizures. However, significant protection was afforded only when gamma-vinyl GABA was infused into the nigra. The protective effect was reduced when injections were made at sites 2 mm dorsal to the nigra, and was further diminished when the drug was injected into the striatum. These results further support the hypothesis that elevation of cerebral GABA levels is protective against a range of experimentally induced seizures, particularly when the substantia nigra is the target of such manipulations.
6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a neurotoxin that generates an experimental model of Parkinson's disease in rodents and is commonly employed to induce a lesion in dopaminergic pathways. The characterization of those molecular mechanisms linked to 6-OHDA-induced early toxicity is needed to better understand the cellular events further leading to neurodegeneration. The present work explored how 6-OHDA triggers early downstream signaling pathways that activate neurotoxicity in the rat striatum. Mitochondrial function, caspases-dependent apoptosis, kinases signaling (Akt, ERK 1/2, SAP/JNK and p38) and crosstalk between nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were evaluated at early times post-lesion. We found that 6-OHDA initiates cell damage via mitochondrial complex I inhibition, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release, as well as activation of caspases 9 and 3 to induce apoptosis, kinase signaling modulation and NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses, accompanied by inhibition of antioxidant systems regulated by the Nrf2 pathway. Our results suggest that kinases SAP/JNK and p38 up-regulation may play a role in the early stages of 6-OHDA toxicity to trigger intrinsic pathways for apoptosis and enhanced NF-κB activation. In turn, these cellular events inhibit the activation of cytoprotective mechanisms, thereby leading to a condition of general damage.
It is common knowledge that cocaine has been linked to the development of various acute and chronic cardiovascular complications including acute coronary syndromes. We present a young, male patient, drug abuser who underwent CABG due to anterolateral myocardial infarction. Our presentation is one of the very rare cases reported in literature regarding acute thrombosis of left main coronary artery related to cocaine use, in a patient with normal coronary arteries, successfully operated. Drug-abusers seem to have increased mortality and morbidity after surgery and high possibility for stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary interventions, because of their usually terrible medical compliance and coexistent several problems of general health. There are no specific guidelines about treatment of thrombus formation in coronary arteries, as a consequence of cocaine use. So, any decision making concerning the final treatment of these patient is a unique and individualized approach. We strongly recommend that all these patients should be treated surgically, especially patients with thrombus into the left main artery.
We report a case of a severe hypokalaemia by intracellular shift of potassium in a sedated and ventilated head trauma patient. The kalaemia which was 3.9 mmol.L-1 at admission in the intensive care unit decreased to 1.3 mmol.L-1 during a perfusion of noradrenaline (0.3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Following the decrease of the noradrenaline dose, and administration of potassium, the kalaemia rapidly increased to 5.3 mmol.L-1 carrying a risk of arrhythmia. Therefore, kalaemia and ECG should be closely monitored when the noradrenaline doses are reduced. The causes of transcellular shift of potassium are reviewed.
Daily urine volumes, plasma creatinine concentrations, and creatinine clearance were measured in 106 patients with unipolar and bipolar affective disorders attending a "lithium" clinic. Urine volumes exceeded 3.51 in only six patients, plasma creatinine concentrations exceeded 150 mumol/1 (1.7 mg/100 ml) in only five, and creatinine clearance was below 50 ml/min in 16. Renal function was assessed by measuring creatinine clearance and renal tubular function, including response to 20 hours of water deprivation, in a representative sample of 30 patients from the lithium clinic and 30 psychiatric patients matched for age and sex who were taking other psychotropic drugs. Creatinine clearance and tubular function, including urine osmolality after water deprivation, were not significantly different between the two groups. Urinary excretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP), however, was much greater in the lithium-treated patients, who therefore had a diminished tubular responsiveness to AVP. The findings do not support suggestions that long-term lithium treatment results in seriously impaired renal function, renal damage, and polyuria. Compared with other series, however, the patients were being maintained with low serum lithium concentrations, which apparently area as effective prophylactically as higher concentrations.
Impairments in verbal learning and memory functioning have been found to be cardinal features among individuals with schizophrenia as well as among non-schizophrenic cocaine abusers. Cognitive deficits in these areas, moreover, have been associated with poor treatment response and short-term outcome. Little is known, however, about the acute effects of cocaine abuse on schizophrenic patients' learning and memory functioning. Consequently, a potentially reversible and treatable source of cognitive impairment has been virtually ignored. The present study examined the extent of verbal learning and memory impairment in a group of cocaine-dependent schizophrenic patients (n=42) and a group of non-schizophrenic cocaine-dependent patients (n=21) within 72 h of the last cocaine use using the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Schizophrenic patients (n=34) without any substance-use disorders were also tested in an identical time frame and served as a comparison group. Results revealed that all groups demonstrated significant learning and memory impairment relative to CVLT published age and gender corrected norms. Both cocaine-dependent and non-substance abusing schizophrenic groups presented a very similar pattern of impaired learning and recall performance across all CVLT task domains. Comorbid patients, in contrast, presented with marked deficits in their ability to learn and recall verbal information relative to either schizophrenic or cocaine-only groups. Moreover, the cocaine-abusing schizophrenic patients showed significant forgetfulness of the information that they did acquire during delayed recall conditions. The performance deficits exhibited by cocaine-abusing schizophrenic patients differed not only in relative severity of impairment, but also qualitatively in their increased rates of forgetfulness of acquired information. These results are interpreted in terms of the neurobiological substrates of learning and memory and the neurobiological impact of cocaine on schizophrenic patients' cognition during the early phase of inpatient hospitalization. These results suggest that comorbid patients should be targeted for specialized remediation efforts at the beginning phases of inpatient treatment.
The scientific community is on the look-out for safe biomolecules useful in the prevention of obesity and related aberrations such as fatty liver. This study analyzed the influence of resveratrol on hepatic triacylglycerol metabolism.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control and resveratrol-treated groups (30 mg/kg of body weight per day) and fed a commercial obesogenic diet for 6 wk. Liver triacylglycerol content and the activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-Ia (CPT-Ia), acyl-coenzyme A oxydase (ACO), fatty acid synthase (FAS), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), malic enzyme (ME), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) activation were measured. Mitochondrial protein cytochrome C oxidase subunit 2 (COXII), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), hepatocyte nuclear factor receptor-4α (HNF-4α), and PGC-1α mRNA levels were also analyzed. Serum insulin was quantified.
Resveratrol decreased liver fat accumulation, increased CPT-Ia and ACO, and decreased ACC activities. Other lipogenic enzymes, FAS, ME, and G6PDH were not modified. The polyphenol activated AMPK and PGC-1α. The expression of SRBP-1c, PPAR-α, SIRT1, PGC-1α, HNF-4α, TFAM, and COXII was not modified. No changes in serum insulin levels were observed.
Resveratrol partly prevents the increase in liver fat accumulation induced by high-fat high-sucrose feeding by increasing fatty acid oxidation and decreasing lipogenesis. These effects are mediated by the activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 axis.
A broad region on chromosome 4q was previously linked to the phenotype of alcohol dependence in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism sample. A strong positional candidate gene was identified within this region: tachykinin receptor 3 gene (TACR3), which encodes tachykinin receptor 3 (NK3R), the receptor for the tachykinin 3 (neurokinin B) peptide. Pharmacological studies have provided evidence that the administration of NK3R agonists attenuates the intake of alcohol and NK3R can also mediate the acute and chronic behavioral effects of cocaine.
Thirty SNPs were genotyped throughout TACR3. Family based association analysis was performed in 219 European American families to detect an association with alcohol dependence. Subsequent analyses were performed to evaluate the evidence of association with other definitions of alcohol dependence as well as cocaine dependence.
Seven of the 9 SNPs in the 3' region of TACR3 provided significant evidence of association with alcohol dependence (p <or= 0.05). Further analyses suggest that the evidence of association is strongest among those subjects with more severe alcohol dependence (defined by ICD-10) and those with co-morbid cocaine dependence. Haplotype analyses further strengthen the evidence of association in the 3' region of the gene.
These results indicate that sequence variations in TACR3 contribute to the variation in more severe alcohol dependent individuals and those who are also cocaine dependent.
Various mechanisms have been proposed to account for chemotherapy related ischemia, but none of them can explain the available clinical data. In order to explore the possibility that the decreased ability of erythrocytes to deliver oxygen to the heart could be responsible for cardiotoxicity, we have performed an ex vivo and in vivo study of the effects of cisplatin/5-FU on erythrocytes, using a variety of biophysical techniques. Combining EPR and microscopy it was concluded that both cardiotoxic 5-FU and non-cardiotoxic cisplatin have similar effects on the erythrocyte membrane, thus eliminating those changes as a potential source of cardiotoxicity. On the contrary, 31P-NMR and polarography showed that the effects of these cytostatics on the intracellular milieu differ significantly. 5-FU provoked a pronounced decrease of the O2 level in blood and affected the metabolism of phosphate compounds, while cisplatin had no such effects. When combined these two drugs showed synergistic effects, which matches the higher frequency of cardiotoxicity of the combination relative to the sole application of 5-FU. Preliminary results acquired on blood of patients receiving cisplatin/5-FU therapy verified observations obtained ex vivo. These results open a possibility of applying NMR in preclinical trials of new drugs in order to predict their ischemic potential.
Carmofur, a derivative of 5-fluorouracil, has recently been noted to have an infrequent but serious association with leukoencephalopathy. To our knowledge, there has been no report of early MRI findings in this leukoencephalopathy. We describe a case in which diffuse high signal intensity of the entire cerebral white matter, including the corpus callosum, was seen on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Although similar findings can be seen in many other diseases, carmofur-induced leukoencephalopathy should be suspected in a patient treated with carmofur. It is important to know the clinical and MRI characteristics of this condition, for early diagnosis and better prognosis.
