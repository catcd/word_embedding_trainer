Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is an entity characterized by elevated intracranial pressure of probably multifactoral origin, but most cases remain idiopathic. We report a 15-year-old girl with PTC due to prolonged consumption of Arovit (Vitamin A) for treatment of acne. The diagnosis was established by measuring raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure after an intracranial mass lesion and dural venous sinsus thrombosis were excluded. The increased level of vitamin A confirmed the diagnosis of hypervitaminosis A as the causative pathogen. The patient was treated with lumbar punctures and acetazolamide (Diamox). PTC due to hypervitaminosis A is a serious complication, which can cause permanent visual impairment. Patients treated with retinoids require proper surveillance. The elevated serum level of retinoids after withdrawal may persist for weeks.
The cyclosporine analog Valspodar (PSC 833, Novartis Pharma) is a strong inhibitor of the mdr1 gene product p-glycoprotein (pgp). A phase I/II study was conducted in order to evaluate if addition of Valspodar to treatment with daunorubicin and cytarabine, given to patients with primary refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, could increase the complete remission rate.Fifty-three patients were treated in cohorts of three to six patients. Twelve patients reached a complete remission in bone marrow, five of whom also normalized their peripheral blood values. Three patients experienced treatment-related deaths from pneumonia, liver failure and cerebral hemorrhage, respectively. It is concluded that Valspodar 10 mg/kg per 24 h in combination with daunorubicin 45 mg/m(2) for 3 days and cytarabine 1 g/m(2) twice daily for 4 days is tolerable in this heavily pre-treated group of patients. Due to the moderate treatment results, the phase II part of the study was ended prematurely. The modulation of only pgp did not give an obvious improvement of the treatment results in this group of patients.
Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often have a protracted course. However, all these patients are immunosuppressed and may have a high incidence of cutaneous malignancies.
To determine if combination therapy using topical imiquimod cream 5% and the oral cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor are useful in the therapy of squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCC in situ)/Bowen's disease in patients with long-standing CLL.
Five CLL patients with head and neck cutaneous SCC in situ, which met criteria for Bowen's disease, were treated with topical 5% topical imiquimod cream and an oral COX inhibitor, sulindac 200 mg twice a day.
All patients showed clinical resolution and histologic clearing of the tumors after 16 weeks of therapy.
The local immune modulator, 5% imiquimod, in combination with a COX inhibitor, with its many potential antitumor effects may stimulate the innate and possibly the adaptive immune responses to clear these malignancies.
Since adverse effects due to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors frequently occur in cutaneous locations, this review summarizes the spectrum of expected and unexpected adverse effects of these drugs, possible associated mechanisms, and their basic functions for dermatologists. ACE inhibitors block the activity of the metalloproteinase ACE by binding to its active site, thus displacing angiotensin I and preventing its conversion to vasopressive angiotensin II. Furthermore, ACE degrades bradykinin, substance P, enkephalins and some of the reproductive peptide hormones. The overall incidence of adverse effects to ACE inhibitors is estimated at 28%, approximately half of which occurs in the skin. General reactions are first-dose hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal failure. Cutaneous reactions comprise life-threatening angioedema, pruritus, bullous eruptions, urticaria, other generalized rashes, photosensitivity and hair loss. ACE inhibitors thus mimic a broad variety of skin diseases, why these drugs should be thought of when sudden, unexplainable skin eruptions are observed.
: A multicenter, double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of balsalazide in pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC).
: Sixty-eight patients, 5 to 17 years of age, with mild-to-moderate active UC based on the modified Sutherland UC activity index (MUCAI) were randomized to receive oral balsalazide 2.25 or 6.75 g/day for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement (reduction of the MUCAI score by > or =3 points from baseline). Clinical remission (MUCAI score of 0 or 1 for stool frequency) and histological improvement after 8 weeks were also assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters for balsalazide, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid were determined at 2 weeks. Adverse events and laboratory changes were monitored throughout the study.
: Clinical improvement was achieved by 45% and 37% of patients and clinical remission by 12% and 9% of patients receiving 6.75 and 2.25 g/day, respectively. Improvement in histologic grade was achieved by 8 of 16 (50%) and 3 of 10 (30%) patients receiving 6.75 and 2.25 g/day, respectively. No significant differences were seen in efficacy. Pharmacokinetics in 12 patients were characterized by large interpatient variability and low systemic exposure. Adverse events were similar between the treatment groups, the most common being headache and abdominal pain. No clinically significant changes were observed in laboratory values, including those indicative of hepatic or renal toxicity.
: Balsalazide is well tolerated and improves the signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate active UC in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age.
The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA). VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals. Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.
We report a case of Meige syndrome with apraxia of lid opening that lasted for about seven months after discontinuation of sulpiride treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that Meige syndrome with apraxia of lid opening is induced by sulpiride, and that the condition persists.
We report on the case of a 65-year-old female who was treated for one week with famotidine, a reversible H(2)-histamine antagonist, due to gastric pain. Shortly after treatment began, she presented manic symptoms and developed two generalized seizures, after which famotidine was discontinued. Manic symptoms were present for three months; intermittent treatment with both carbamazepine and antipsychotic medication was necessary before her mental status was completely restored. While cimetidine and ranitidine are known to cause secondary mania, this symptom has not been described for famotidine. CNS side effects are usually short-lived and respond to discontinuation of the drug, which was not the case in our patient. During a follow-up period that has so far lasted four years, the patient has been stable without any psychiatric medication. Adjusting the maintenance dosage of H(2)-histamine antagonists has been recommended in elderly patients since age-related reduction in renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate and renal tubular function may be present, which can in turn elevate histamine levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Our patient, however, had normal renal function and was free of organic or psychiatric diseases, so what pathogenetic mechanism led to the remarkably long standing manic syndrome after a relatively short course of famotidine remained unknown; famotidine seems to cause the same spectrum of adverse central nervous system (CNS) reactions as other H(2)-histamine antagonists.
The potential antiatherogenic actions of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan were investigated in apolipoprotein (apo) E deficient mice, an animal model with severe hypercholesterolemia and extensive atherosclerosis. In these animals accelerated atherosclerosis is associated with increased lipid peroxidation which may play a crucial role in the build up of the atherosclerotic lesions. Administration of losartan (25mg/kg/d) to the apo E deficient mice for a 3-month period increased the plasma renin activity 3.5-fold compared to the placebo group. Losartan increased the resistance of LDL to CuSO4-induced oxidative modification as shown by a significant reduction in the LDL content of malondialdehyde by 55% compared to placebo, as well as by the prolongation of the lag time required for LDL oxidation, from 60 min in the placebo-treated mice to more than 140 min in the losartan-treated mice. Losartan reduced significantly the mean atherosclerotic lesion area by 80% compared to the placebo group. We conclude that losartan inhibits LDL lipid peroxidation in the apo E deficient mice and this effect may have an important role in the attenuation of the accelerated atherosclerosis.
This paper reviews 81,756 live births and 858 infant deaths occurring during the years 1959 to 1969. Sixty-three instances of central nervous system vacuolation are reported. Prematurity is shown to be a necessary prerequisite for central nervous system vacuolation to occur during routine antiseptic skin care of newborn infants with 3% hexachlorophene emulsions. Hyperbilirubinaemia is a contributory factor in such premature infants. Long-term clinical follow-up studies show that, should central nervous system vacuolation occur in premature infants, there is no resultant detriment to their immediate clinical progress and physical and neurological development. Normal newborn infants weighing more than 2,000 g do not develop such central nervous system vacuolation during routine antiseptic skin care. The writers conclude that there is no rationale for regulations to restrict the use of 3% hexachlorophene emulsions in routine antiseptic skin care of normal newborn infants and that the benefits of such use far outweigh any possible risks from central nervous system vacuolation.
Immunity to Leishmania donovani is associated with an interleukin (IL)-12 driven T helper 1 (Th1) response. In addition, the ability to respond to chemotherapy with sodium stibogluconate (SSG) requires a fully competent immune response and both Th1 and Th2 responses have been shown to positively influence the outcome of drug treatment. In the present study, the influence of IL-18, which can modulate both interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-4 production, on the outcome of primary L. donovani infection and SSG therapy following infection was assessed using BALB/c IL-18-deficient and wild type mice. IL-18 deficiency was associated with an increased susceptibility to L. donovani infection, evident by day 40 post infection, resulting in higher parasite burdens in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow compared with wild type control animals. Infected IL-18-deficient mice had significantly lower splenocyte concanavalin A (ConA) induced IFN-gamma production as well as lower serum IL-12 and IFN-gamma levels, indicating a reduced Th1 response. However, drug treatment was equally effective in both mouse strains and restored serum IL-12 and IFN-gamma levels, and IFN-gamma production by ConA stimulated splenocytes of IL-18-deficient mice, to levels equivalent to similarly treated wild type mice.
beta-Blocking actions of orally administered Kö 1400 and tiprenolol, new beta-blocking agents, were studied in unanesthetized rats and dogs, using a fall of blood pressure and an increase in heart rate produced by isoproterenol as a measure of beta-receptor activation. Blood pressure was recorded from the aorta of the dog and the caudal artery of rat via indwelling catheter, and heart rate of the dog was recorded by a cardiotachometer triggered by R waves of the lead II electrocardiogram. Mean resting blood pressure was 116 mmHg in rats and 93 mmHg in dogs, and heart rate was 99 beats/min in dogs. Isoproterenol (0.5 microgram/kg) was injected via indwelling venous catheter. Kö 1400, tiprenolol and propranolol inhibited the hypotension and tachycardia induced by isoproterenol at an oral dose level of 2 mg/kg or more. beta-blocking action in these preparations was found to be tiprenolol greater than Kö 1400 greater than propranolol. Pharmacological half life of tiprenolol was longer than that of propranolol, whereas that of Kö 1400 was shorter. No selectivity of beta-blocking actions was observed with all three beta-blockers. These findings are in agreement with the results obtained in isolated atrial and tracheal preparations of the guinea pig.
Abstract This study examined the effects of (-)schisandrin B [(-)Sch B] on MAPK and Nrf2 activation and the subsequent induction of glutathione antioxidant response and cytoprotection against apoptosis in AML12 hepatocytes. Pharmacological tools, such as cytochrome P-450 (CYP) inhibitor, antioxidant, MAPK inhibitors and Nrf2 RNAi, were used to delineate the signalling pathway. (-)Sch B caused a time-dependent activation of MAPK in AML12 cells, particularly the ERK1/2. The MAPK activation was followed by an enhancement in Nrf2 nuclear translocation and the eliciting of a glutathione antioxidant response. Reactive oxygen species arising from a CYP-catalysed reaction with (-)Sch B seemed to be causally related to the activation of MAPK and Nrf2. ERK inhibition by U0126 or Nrf2 suppression by Nrf2 RNAi transfection almost completely abrogated the cytoprotection against menadione-induced apoptosis in (-)Sch B-pre-treated cells. (-)Sch B pre-treatment potentiated the menadione-induced ERK activation, whereas both p38 and JNK activations were suppressed. Under the condition of ERK inhibition, Sch B treatment did not protect against carbon tetrachloride-hepatotoxicity in an in vivo mouse model. In conclusion, (-)Sch B triggers a redox-sensitive ERK/Nrf2 signalling, which then elicits a cellular glutathione antioxidant response and protects against oxidant-induced apoptosis in AML12 cells.
It is well documented that quinine induces reversible hearing loss and tinnitus. The purpose in this study was to induce a quinine hearing loss and to investigate if verapamil, a Ca2+ channel antagonist of L-type might affect the response. Pigmented guinea pigs (n = 24) were anaesthetized by atropine. Hypnorm and midazolam but permitting spontaneous respiration. An electrode of platinum was placed on the round window and short (10 msec) tone pulses at 8 kHz were presented to the external ear. A typical deflection of the N1-wave was determined as the hearing threshold. Quinine hydrochloride 40 mg/kg and verapamil 1 mg/kg were given intravenously. Quinine induced a significant and reversible hearing loss (mean 16 dB). This hearing loss was not at all affected by verapamil given before or after quinine. Verapamil often caused acute cardiac arrest and particularly the combination verapamil followed by quinine-induced death to the animal. We conclude that verapamil and quinine had no in vivo interaction with regard to the hearing ability.
Liver biopsies from 9 out of every 10 obese individuals exhibit pathological changes of unknown aetiology and 3 out of every 10 reflect severe injury in the form of periportal fibrosis. To examine the hypothesis that excessive fibrosis in obesity arises in part from a predisposition to injury of the liver by drugs and xenobiotics, we administered 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg doses of the model periportal hepatotoxin, allyl alcohol, to obese Sprague-Dawley rats and age-matched non-obese controls. Alanine aminotransferase activity (ALT) in plasma was ten-fold more elevated in obese animals than in non-obese animals given the 25 mg/kg dose (P < 0.05). On fitting the ALT results to a non-linear, parametric model by iterative non-linear least squares regression, we found that the slope of the log dose ALT curve was similar for obese and non-obese rats. However, the minimum dose required to produce elevated ALT (DMIN) was 50% lower for obese animals (DMIN 6.47 +/- 2.75 vs. 13.3 +/- 0.96 mg allyl alcohol; P < 0.05). In a subsequent experiment, allyl alcohol was administered to obese rats based on ideal body weight, which is defined as the mean total body weight of an age-matched non-obese animal. With this dosing normalization, the 25 mg/kg ideal body weight doses translated to administration of a fixed dose of 13.5 mg allyl alcohol to obese rats. Obese rats treated in this fashion exhibited more severe necrosis in the periportal zone (median necrosis score 2 versus 0-1, P < 0.05) and increased mortality over controls (44% versus 0%; P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Acquired copper deficiency has recently been recognized as a cause of myeloneuropathy mimicking subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B-12 deficiency. A remote history of gastric surgery is frequently associated with this syndrome. However, the very limited prevalence of severe copper deficiency in patients with a history of gastric surgery suggests that additional contributing factors are likely to be involved. We describe a patient with copper deficiency and a previous Billroth II partial gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma, presenting with severe myelo-optico-neuropathy, demyelinating lesions of the brain, and subjective hyposmia. An abnormal glucose breath test also revealed small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome. Copper replacement therapy associated with antibiotic therapy was effective in preventing further neurological damage and in obtaining mild improvement. We propose that copper status should be evaluated in all patients presenting with unexplained noninflammatory myeloneuropathy. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome should be investigated as a cause of generalized malabsorption and a possible contributing factor to copper deficiency after gastric surgery, as should occult zinc ingestion.
Restriction point transit and commitment to a new round of cell division is regulated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and its obligate activating partners, the D-type cyclins. In this study, we examined the ability of D-type cyclins to promote cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity. Adult transgenic mice expressing cyclin D1, D2, or D3 under the regulation of the alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain promoter exhibited high rates of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis under baseline conditions. Cardiac injury in mice expressing cyclin D1 or D3 resulted in cytoplasmic cyclin D accumulation, with a concomitant reduction in the level of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis. In contrast, cardiac injury in mice expressing cyclin D2 did not alter subcellular cyclin localization. Consequently, cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity persisted in injured hearts expressing cyclin D2, ultimately resulting in infarct regression. These data suggested that modulation of D-type cyclins could be exploited to promote regenerative growth in injured hearts.
To study the clinical and radiological characteristics of levamisole-induced leukoencephalopathy (LILE) in patients with recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) or infected with Ascaris.
The medical histories of 16 patients with LILE were analyzed, including clinical manifestations, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain biopsy findings.
The main clinical manifestations of LILE were motor weakness (75.0%), dysphasia or aphasia (50.0%), cognitive disorder (50.0%), and facial palsy (43.8%). The MRI of 16 cases showed plaque and round or oval demyelinating lesions in white matter, which revealed a signal hypointensity on T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images (DWI), and demonstrated hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The MRI revealed peripheral ring-type enhancement about the focus after Gd-DTPA administration and edema around some lesions, without mass effect. T2-weighted and FLAIR images were highly sensitive to the lesions. Brain biopsy in 1 patient showed multifocal demyelinating lesions without perivascular cuffing by lymphocytes. Treatment generally consisted of steroids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and patients recovered to normal condition.
A single normal dose of levamisole can induce leukoencephalopathy in patients with RAU or Ascaris. The diagnosis depends on the clinical features and imaging appearances. Steroid therapy might be a good choice of treatment.
The toxin ricin has been shown to cause inflammatory lung damage, leading to pulmonary oedema and, at higher doses, mortality. In order to understand the genetic basis of this inflammatory cascade a custom microarray platform (1509 genes) directed towards immune and inflammatory markers was used to investigate the temporal expression profiles of genes in a Balb/c mouse model of inhalational ricin exposure. To facilitate examination of those genes involved in both inflammatory cascades and wound repair the dose which was investigated was sub-lethal across a 96-h time course. Histopathology of the lung was mapped across the time course and genetic responses considered in the context of overall lung pathology. Six hundred and eighty-five genes were found to be statistically significantly different compared to controls, across the time course and these genes have been investigated in the context of their biological function in ricin poisoning. As well as confirming key inflammatory markers associated with ricin intoxication (TNFalpha and IL1beta) several pathways that are altered in expression were identified following pulmonary exposure to ricin. These genes included those involved in cytokine-cytokine signalling cascades (IL1, IL1r, IL1r2, Ccl 4, 6, 10), focal adhesion (Fn1, ICAM1) and tissue remodelling (VEGF, Pim1). Furthermore, the observed alteration in expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) indicates a key role in membrane integrity and cellular adhesion in ricin poisoning. Data captured using this transcriptomic approach could be used to develop a specific approach to the treatment of inhalational ricin exposure. This work was conducted as part of a wider programme of work to compare a number of militarily relevant lung damaging agents, with a view to establishing a rational basis for the identification of more generic medical countermeasures.
Until recently, pentabromodiphenyl (PentaBDE) and decabromodiphenyl (DecaBDE) ethers were commonly used as flame retardants in a wide array of products, mostly in the production of plastics utilized in the electric, electronic and textile industries. The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity of PentaBDE and DecaBDE after their repeated (7-28 days) intragastric administration to rats. The compounds were given at doses of 2, 8, 40 or 200 mg/kg/day (PentaBDE) and 10, 100 or 1,000 mg/kg/day (DecaBDE). The repeated administration of PentaBDE disturbed redox homeostasis, which was manifested by lower total antioxidant status and increased activity of glutathione reductase in serum and higher concentrations of glutathione reduced and malondialdehyde in the liver. The occurrence of these effects was not observed after DecaBDE administration. The results of histopathological examination showed fatty degeneration after administration of the highest dose of PentaBDE. The repeated administration of PentaBDE also caused the increase in relative liver mass, dose-dependent increase in the activity of CYP 1A (EROD) and CYP 2B (PROD), 7-12- and 2-8-fold, respectively, as well as enhanced level of CYP 1A1 (5-30-fold) and CYP 4A (2-4.5-fold). The administration of DecaBDE induced much less pronounced changes: a maximum 2.8-fold increase in the activity of CYP 1A, a twofold increase in CYP 2B, and no alterations in other parameters under study. Contrary to DecaBDE, PentaBDE disturbed redox homeostasis, and induced liver microsomal enzymes. Fatty degeneration in liver caused by this compound was also found.
The cellular effects of biodiesel emissions particulate matter (BDEP) and petroleum diesel emissions particulate matter (PDEP) were compared using a human airway cell line, A549. At concentrations of 25 microg/ml, diesel particulate matter induced the formation of multinucleate cells. In cells treated with a mixture of 80% PDEP:20% BDEP, 52% of cells were multinucleate cells compared with only 16% of cells treated with 20% PDEP:80% BDEP with a background multinucleate rate of 7%. These results demonstrate a causal relation between the formation of multinucleate cells and exposure to exhaust particulate matter, in particular diesel exhaust. Exposure of A549 cells to PDEP induced apoptosis, seen by active caspase-3 expression and the presence of cleaved pancytokeratin. PDEP exhaust was a much stronger inducer of cellular death through apoptosis than BDEP. There was an eightfold increase in the expression of SLC30A3 (zinc transporter-3 or ZnT3) in cells exposed to 80% PDEP:20% BDEP compared to untreated cells. The increase in ZnT3 expression seen in apoptotic cells following PDEP suggests a role for this zinc transporter in the apoptotic pathway, possibly through controlling zinc fluxes. As exposure to diesel exhaust particles is associated with asthma and apoptosis in airway cells, diesel exhaust particles may directly contribute to asthma by inducing epithelial cell death through apoptotic pathway.
Adriamycin (ADR) induces glomerular damage in rats with persistent severe proteinuria which reaches a peak 15 days after a single 5 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.) injection. We studied in ADR-treated rats the effects of a low-protein (6%) diet (LPD) supplemented with keto acids on urinary protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion and glomerular GAG contents. Animals were divided into three groups: group 1 was used as control, and groups 2 and 3 received a single i.v. injection of ADR; group 2 was fed a standard diet (21% protein) and group 3 an LPD. After ADR, group 2 developed heavy proteinuria and showed a progressive increase in urinary GAG excretion starting a few days after the beginning of proteinuria onset and persisting throughout the experiment. After ADR, group 3 (LPD treatment) did not develop proteinuria, and the level of urinary GAGs was comparable to that of controls. The glomerular GAG level in ADR-treated rats was greatly reduced as compared to controls; this decrease was partly eliminated in rats on an LPD. These results suggest that an LPD has a direct effect on cellular GAG production and turnover in ADR-induced glomerulonephritis.
We previously showed that betaxolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, administered during early phases of cocaine abstinence, ameliorated withdrawal-induced anxiety and blocked increases in amygdalar beta(1)-adrenergic receptor expression in rats. Here, we report the efficacy of betaxolol in reducing increases in gene expression of amygdalar corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a peptide known to be involved in mediating 'anxiety-like' behaviors during initial phases of cocaine abstinence. We also demonstrate attenuation of an amygdalar beta(1)-adrenergic receptor-mediated cell-signaling pathway following this treatment. Male rats were administered betaxolol at 24 and 44 h following chronic cocaine administration. Animals were euthanized at the 48-h time point and the amygdala was microdissected and processed for quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and/or western blot analysis. Results showed that betaxolol treatment during early cocaine withdrawal attenuated increases in amygdalar CRF gene expression and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase regulatory and catalytic subunit (nuclear fraction) protein expression. Our data also reveal that beta(1)-adrenergic receptors are on amygdalar neurons, which are immunoreactive for CRF. The present findings suggest that the efficacy of betaxolol treatment on cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety may be related, in part, to its effect on amygdalar beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, modulation of its downstream cell-signaling elements and CRF gene expression.
In thiobutabarbitone-anaesthetized rats, microinjection of clonidine (1-40 nmol) into the anterior hypothalamic area (AHy) produced dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Microinjection of the kappa-opioid agonist U-50,488H (3 and 10 nmol) did not modify these parameters. Simultaneous co-administration of clonidine (4 nmol) and U-50,488H (10 nmol) into the AHy resulted in significant potentiation of the clonidine-induced hypotension and marked attenuation of the bradycardia. A lower dose of U-50,488H (3 nmol) co-administered with clonidine (4 nmol) did not influence the cardiovascular responses to clonidine. These findings suggest that AHy neurons involved in the cardiovascular responses to clonidine may be modulated by kappa-opioid receptor stimulation.
Smoking is known to affect microcirculatory function in a middle-aged population. However, the effects of smoking on myocardial perfusion in young smokers have not been studied. Myocardial perfusion was measured in 15 smokers (24 +/- 2 years) and 15 nonsmokers (24 +/- 3 years) using positron emission tomography. Myocardial perfusion was measured at rest, during cold stress and during dipyridamole. Resting myocardial blood flow was similar in the two groups. The well-described correlation between rate-pressure product and myocardial blood flow was present only in the nonsmokers (r(2) = 0.61, p < 0.001). Myocardial blood flow corrected for the rate-pressure product declined during cold by 20% in the smokers [1.11 +/- 0.28 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.20 ml x g(-1) x min(-1) (p = 0.012)], but remained unchanged in nonsmokers [1.11 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.09 +/- 0.30 ml x g(-1) x min(-1) (p = NS)]. Dipyridamole-induced hyperemia was similar in the two groups [2.23 +/- 0.78 vs. 2.42 +/- 0.65 ml x g(-1) x min(-1) (p = NS)]. In conclusion, smoking induces abnormalities in myocardial microcirculatory regulation in young otherwise healthy smokers. The coronary flow reserve, however, is not significantly altered.
A previously healthy woman developed acute anicteric hepatitis which slowly resolved, though bilateral anterior uveitis then appeared. No other cause than an occupational exposure to trichloroethylene was found, and rechallenge by resuming work has led to a transient increase in serum alkaline phosphatase. Both manifestations may constitute a rare systemic reaction to trichloroethylene.
In this study, we investigated the effects of Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai extract (SQE) and its main constituent, p-coumaric acid, on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. SQE markedly inhibited adipogenesis by downregulating the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and aP2. It also decreased the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and adiponectin mRNAs in differentiating adipocytes. SQE increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation during the early phase of MDI-induced differentiation, suggesting that SQE exerted its anti-adipogenic effect via AMPK activation at an early stage of the differentiation process. p-Coumaric acid suppressed adipogenesis by attenuating the expression of C/EBPα, PPARγ, and SREBP-1c during the late phase of MDI-induced differentiation. In addition, p-coumaric acid increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, and the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) mRNA, in fully differentiated adipocytes, indicating that it promotes fatty acid β-oxidation via AMPK signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that SQE and p-coumaric acid might have the anti-obesitic effects via AMPK pathway in 3T3-L1 cells.
