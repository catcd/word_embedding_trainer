The frequency of common oncogenic mutations and TP53 was determined in Asian oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
The OncoCarta(â„¢) panel v1.0 assay was used to characterize oncogenic mutations. In addition, exons 4-11 of the TP53 gene were sequenced. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify associations between mutations and selected clinico-pathological characteristics and risk habits.
Oncogenic mutations were detected in PIK3CA (5.7%) and HRAS (2.4%). Mutations in TP53 were observed in 27.7% (31/112) of the OSCC specimens. Oncogenic mutations were found more frequently in non-smokers (p = 0.049) and TP53 truncating mutations were more common in patients with no risk habits (p = 0.019). Patients with mutations had worse overall survival compared to those with absence of mutations; and patients who harbored DNA binding domain (DBD) and L2/L3/LSH mutations showed a worse survival probability compared to those patients with wild type TP53. The majority of the oncogenic and TP53 mutations were G:C > A:T and A:T > G:C base transitions, regardless of the different risk habits.
Hotspot oncogenic mutations which are frequently present in common solid tumors are exceedingly rare in OSCC. Despite differences in risk habit exposure, the mutation frequency of PIK3CA and HRAS in Asian OSCC were similar to that reported in OSCC among Caucasians, whereas TP53 mutations rates were significantly lower. The lack of actionable hotspot mutations argue strongly for the need to comprehensively characterize gene mutations associated with OSCC for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
Several chronic studies in rats indicating that cadmium exposure can induce tumors of the ventral prostate have recently been completed in our laboratory. In one such study, a single dose of cadmium, s.c., increased prostatic tumor incidence only at doses below 5.0 mumol/kg, the approximate threshold for cadmium-induced testicular damage. In a further study, prostatic tumors were elevated with higher doses of cadmium (30 mumol/kg, s.c.) if testicular damage was prevented by zinc pretreatment. Most recently, we found that dietary cadmium (25 to 200 micrograms/g) also can increase prostatic neoplastic lesions, but these were reduced by zinc-deficient diets. Thus it appears that cadmium produces prostatic tumors only if testicular function is maintained. Furthermore, we find that metallothionein (MT), a protein associated with cadmium tolerance, may be deficient in the rat prostate, and the prostatic MT gene, at least in the ventral lobe, is unresponsive to metal stimuli. In liver, MT gene expression, as assessed by MT-1 mRNA, was quite apparent in control tissue and was induced in a dose-dependent manner 24 hr following cadmium exposure (1 to 10 mumol/kg, s.c.). However, in the ventral prostate very low constitutive levels of MT-1 mRNA were detected and increases did not occur with cadmium exposure. Cadmium concentrations in the ventral prostate were in excess of those that cause significant induction in the liver. In sharp contrast to the gene in the ventral prostate, in the dorsal prostate the MT gene was quite active. The dorsal prostate is not susceptible to cadmium carcinogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Two adult patients with focal epilepsy who tolerated valproate (VPA) well in different combinations of anticonvulsants developed hyperammonemic encephalopathy when treated with VPA in combination with topiramate (TPM). Topiramate may contribute to the increased ammonia level by its inhibition of carbonic anhydrase and cerebral glutamine synthetase, thereby facilitating VPA/TPM hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Recovery occurred after withdrawal of VPA or TPM.
Among 1,152 psychiatric inpatients who received a phenothiazine, a butyrophenone, or a thioxanthene, 116 developed dystonia attributed to one or more of these drugs. The highest frequencies of dystonia occurred among recipients of haloperidol and the long-acting injectable fluphenazines. For all patients at risk, dystonia was more common in men and in younger patients. For chlorpromazine, high doses, male sex, and low age were each positively associated with dystonia.
A significant relationship between hematocrit values and serum parameters such as the insulin like growth factor (IGF-1) and calcium was observed in patients with posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE). Since angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) decrease hematocrit (Ht) levels in these patients, ACE genotype should play an important role. We designed this study to investigate whether ACE genotype or baseline concentrations of IGF-1, IGF-blood binding protein 3 (BP3), growth hormone (GH), or Ca influenced the response of Ht to ACEI treatment. Twenty-one kidney graft recipients with PTE were treated with enalapril (2.5 to 5 mg/d) for 1 year. IGF-1, BP3, GH, Ca, and Ht were determined before as well as 15, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days after enalapril treatment. ACE polymorphism was also determined. Enalapril treatment significantly decreased Ht levels. Only IGF-1 baseline levels showed a positive correlation to the decreased Ht (P < .025). ACE genotype as determined in 18 patients, showed no correlation with the response to enalapril. Patients with ACE genotype II showed a tendency to an earlier display of PTE. We conclude that low doses of enalapril decrease Ht levels in PTE patients; that PTE begins earlier in patients with II ACE genotype; and that only IGF-1 baseline levels influence the Ht decrease after treatment. These observations suggest that ACEI decrease the Ht via an inhibitory effect on IGF-1, which has a stimulary effect on erythropoiesis.
Thirty-eight patients with chronic vertigo and positional and/or spontaneous nystagmus finished a double-blind study to determine the efficacy of astemizole on nystagmus and its symptoms. Patients with Meniere's disease were excluded. The study took 13 weeks with a follow-up examination. Six to eight noncaloric electronystagmograms were recorded at determined intervals. Three doses of the drug, 5, 10, and 20 mg/d, and placebo were tested. A patient was considered a responder if the number of nystagmic beats occurring in eight head and body positions was reduced by 50% or more and the symptoms of vertigo were greatly reduced. Twenty-eight of the 38 patients were responders. Blood levels of astemizole were related to effectiveness. Patients did not respond to placebo. The onset of drug effect was slow. Astemizole appears to be useful and safe to try on the patient with chronic dizziness.
The author reports an atypical case of tardive dyskinesia in a 19-year-old male who had been given relatively low dosages of neuroleptic medication for less than 6 months. The symptoms cleared within 3 months after the medication was discontinued. The author reviews the literature regarding similar atypical cases and suggests that increased reporting and careful description of such cases might be useful in furthering our understanding of this syndrome.
The authors report seven cases of electrocardiographic abnormalities occurring in 7- to 10-year-old children receiving imipramine pharmacotherapy for behavior disorders. Three of the children evidenced a first-degree atrioventricular block. The abnormalities were less pronounced in the other four children. Imipramine plasma levels during steady state were not found to be directly related to the extent of the electrocardiographic changes within the obtained plasma values. The authors emphasize the necessity of careful clinical surveillance of children receiving imipramine pharmacotherapy.
Activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) is the key process in the development of pancreatic fibrosis, a common feature of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. In recent studies, curcumin has been shown to inhibit PSC proliferation via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2-dependent mechanism. In addition, curcumin is a potent inducer of the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in other cell types. Therefore, the aims of this study were to 1) characterize the effect of curcumin on HO-1 gene expression in PSCs, 2) explore whether HO-1 induction contributes to the inhibitory effect of curcumin on PSC proliferation, and 3) clarify the involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family in this context. Cultured rat PSCs were incubated with curcumin and assessed for HO-1 up-regulation by Northern blot analysis, immunoblotting, and activity assays. The effect of HO-1 on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced PSC proliferation and MAPK activation was determined by immunoblotting, cell proliferation assays, and cell count analyses. Curcumin induced HO-1 gene expression in PSCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner and inhibited PDGF-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and PSC proliferation. These effects were blocked by treatment of PSCs with tin protoporphyrin IX, an HO inhibitor, or transfection of HO-1 small interfering RNA. Our data provide evidence that HO-1 induction contributes to the inhibitory effect of curcumin on PSC proliferation. Therefore, therapeutic up-regulation of HO-1 could represent a mode for inhibition of PSC proliferation and thus may provide a novel strategy in the prevention of pancreatic fibrosis.
The 143 cases of lithium use during pregnancy collected by the Register of Lithium Babies show that infants exposed to lithium appear to have a higher than expected ratio of cardiovascular anomalies to all anomalies and may have an increased risk of congenital heart disease. The authors believe that these findings justify a conservative policy on the use of lithium with fertile and pregnant women.
Niacin lowers serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides, and it raises high-density lipoprotein. However, most patients experience cutaneous warmth and vasodilation (flush). Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) can reduce this flush, presumably by decreasing prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) release from macrophages. Here, we show that methylnicotinate induces significant PGD(2) release from human mast cells and serotonin from human platelets. Intradermal injection of methylnicotinate induces rat skin vasodilation and vascular permeability. Niacin increases plasma PGD(2) and serotonin in a rat model of flush. The phenothiazine prochlorperazine, the H(1), serotonin receptor antagonist cyproheptadine, and the specific serotonin receptor-2A antagonist ketanserin inhibit niacin-induced temperature increase by 90% (n = 5, p < 0.05), 90 and 50% (n = 3, p < 0.05), and 85% (n = 6, p = 0.0008), respectively, in this animal model. These results indicate that niacin-induced flush involves both PGD(2) and serotonin, suggesting that drugs other than ASA are required to effectively inhibit niacin-induced flush.
We present the case of a 29-year-old patient who developed a cerebral infarction, without hemorrhage, after using cocaine. A computed tomography scan of the brain at the time of initial presentation was entirely normal; a repeat CT scan on the fifth hospital day showed a basal ganglion infarction. No evidence of intracranial bleeding was detected. Theories of cocaine-induced cerebral infarction, including promotion of thrombogenesis and vasospasm, are reviewed.
We characterized the overall early effect of chronic ochratoxin A (OTA) treatment on rat liver, analyzing different aspects related to: (i) fibrosis, by measuring collagen content and turnover, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA); (ii) oxidative stress and stress response, by analyzing protein carbonylation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and heat shock protein (HSP70) gene expression; (iii) the possible tumor promoter effect, evaluating cadherin and connexin (CX) mRNA levels. Light microscopy analysis showed no histological differences in OTA-treated and control (CT) rats. Collagen content, determined by computer analysis of Sirius red-stained liver sections, was similar in both groups. In liver homogenates COL-I, COL-III, TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 mRNA levels and alphaSMA were unaffected by OTA. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels were also similar in the two groups. Protein carbonylation, a marker of severe oxidative stress, was not evident in the homogenates of OTA-treated livers; superoxide dismutase (SOD) mRNA tended to be lower and HSP70 was strongly down-regulated. OTA reduced E-cadherin and DSC-2 transcription, and down-regulated liver CX26, CX32 and CX43. In conclusion, these in vivo results show that OTA-induced liver injury involves a reduction in the ability to counterbalance oxidative stress, maybe leading to altered gap junction intercellular communication and loss of cell adhesion and polarity. This suggests that mild oxidative damage might be a key factor, in combination with other cytotoxic effects, in triggering the promotion of liver tumors after exposure to OTA.
The safety of ciprofloxacin, given via 30- and 60-min intravenous infusions at a dose of 300 mg every 12 h for 4 days, was studied in 12 healthy subjects (6 females, 6 males). Local effects of the drug were assessed by frequent examination at the infusion site while systemic safety was determined by haematological and biochemical tests and by careful microscopic examination of the urine for drug crystals and by electroencephalographic studies performed in all subjects before and after dosing. At the site of infusion erythema, itching and a burning sensation developed 10-15 min after onset of infusion in some subjects. These symptoms were slight and did not necessitate termination of the infusions. The rash disappeared in some instances during the infusion and in others within minutes after the end of infusion. The changes usually disappeared, even during the infusion. The incidence of the adverse reactions was not related to the duration of the infusion (30 or 60 min), but was less (frequency and extent) when the anticubital vein was used for infusion rather than when smaller more peripheral veins were employed. Thrombophlebitis occurred after 1 of 96 administrations, and was followed by a return to normal. The electroencephalograms remained normal in all instances. One subject experienced mild nausea of a few hours duration. Only 1 volunteer showed crystalluria; the two such specimens from this subject had the most alkaline pH of all urine samples collected in this study. The probability of crystalluria upon intravenous administration appears not to be higher than after oral administration of ciprofloxacin.
The present study focuses on health assessment of wood based panels which are widely used in interior decoration practices over the recent years in China. Formaldehyde has been identified as chemical indicator of (IAO) and an indoor air pollutant. To test its health effects experiment was undertaken.
A small environmental test chamber (60/L) was used as the generator of emission gas from new panels, and was operating at a temperature of 22.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C and a humidity of 44.4 +/- 2.5% with an air exchange rate of 1.0 +/- 0.15 h-1. On the three experimental days the values of product loading in chamber were 4, 2 and 6 m2/m3, respectively. Eight people were selected randomly from the students and employees of Wuhan Health and Anti-epidemic Station as subjects, with an average age of 21.9 +/- 5.9 years, and a gender ratio of 1:1, and two of them were smokers (one male and one female). The subjects' eyes were exposed to formaldehyde through a pair of goggles. Each goggle had its flow inlet and outlet, and connected to chamber exhaust of emission gas and to an exhaust from the room. The exposure time was very short, just 5 minutes and the formaldehyde doses were at 1.65 +/- 0.01, 2.99 +/- 0.07 and 4.31 +/- 0.02 ppm. A 60-mm linear visual analogue rating scales was used to measure the intensity of sensory eye irritation and a video tape recorder was used to record eye blinking frequency.
The results demonstrated that tests of sensory eye irritation and eye blinking can be used for materials testing, and that a dose-effect as well as a time-variance of the effect can be measured.
The tests showed that eye irritation was perceived at all of the three levels.
Inadvertent and accidental epinephrine overdose might result in potentially lethal complications. We present a case of acute epinephrine toxicity resulting in acute myocardial ischemia in a young boy with combined variable immunodeficiency syndrome who developed severe allergic reaction to intravenous immunoglobulin, and was subsequently given epinephrine by mistake intravenously rather than subcutaneously. He developed significant ischemic changes in standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, transiently raised cardiac enzymes, reduced left ventricular systolic function, pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage. It is suggested that special precautionary measures should be taken regarding the dose and the route while administering epinephrine to avoid mishaps.
Seven infants with persistent neonatal hyperinsulinism were treated in Dhahran Health Centre from 1983 to 1986. The insulin:glucose ratio (serum insulin concentration pmol/l) divided by the blood glucose concentration (mmol/l) ranged from 12 to 636, mean (SD) 177 (201). To control hypoglycaemia, diazoxide (12-24 mg/kg/day) was given in a continuous intravenous glucose infusion (12-22 mg/kg/min) on 11 separate occasions, four infants twice each and three infants once each. An increase of more than one standard deviation in the heart and respiratory rates, together with other symptoms of heart failure, was considered to be evidence of diazoxide toxicity. Cardiorespiratory failure (toxicity) occurred on eight of the 11 occasions (73%) in seven infants. The average daily fluid intake, weight change, respiratory rate and heart rate before treatment were similar whether or not the infant developed toxicity. A diazoxide toxicity index was obtained by multiplying the dose of diazoxide by the insulin:glucose ratio to relate the diazoxide dose to the severity of the disease. In all instances when the toxicity index was more than 1533 (mean (SD) 3732 (2741) cardiac toxicity developed. In contrast, infants with a toxicity index of less than 675 (mean (SD) 364 (270), had no symptoms of toxicity. Symptoms were significantly related to the severity of the disease and the diazoxide dose. It is possible to use the toxicity index to predict the risk of toxicity and to calculate a safe dose of diazoxide in infants with persistent neonatal hyperinsulinism.
Benzotrichloride (BTC) is used in the synthesis of benzoyl chloride and benzoyl peroxide. Epidemiological data suggest that BTC is a human lung carcinogen. In the present study, BTC was evaluated for its ability to induce lung adenomas in strain A/J mice. Four groups of 15 male and 15 female A/J mice were injected i.p. with either tricaprylin or BTC in tricaprylin three times a week for 8 weeks. BTC groups received doses totaling 1440 mg/kg, 719 mg/kg or 287 mg/kg. The mean number of lung tumors per mouse was 127 87 +/- 5.81, 43 +/- 2.44, and 17.73 +/- 1.09 in the groups treated with either 1440 mg/kg, 719 mg/kg, or 287 mg/kg, respectively. Tricaprylin-vehicle controls had a mean number of 0.46 +/- 0.15 lung tumors per mouse. Therefore, BTC produced a significant (P less than 0.001) and dose-related increase in the lung tumor response when compared to tricaprylin controls and is a potent carcinogen in the strain A mouse lung tumor bioassay.
Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels correlate with increased progression and poor prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). VEGF expression is regulated by hypoxia and cytokines, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). In this report, we examined IGF-1 signaling and VEGF expression in SCC-9 cells. IGF-1 and the chemical hypoxia agent, cobalt chloride, each stimulated VEGF secretion and VEGF promoter activation. Cobalt chloride increased Hif-1alpha protein levels and HIF-1 dependent activation of the enolase promoter. IGF-1 increased these parameters only in the presence of cobalt chloride. IGF-1 stimulated PI-3K/Akt and Erk/MAPK pathways in SCC-9 cells, each contributing to Hif-1alpha expression and VEGF secretion. SCC-9 cells express the VEGF receptors Flk-1 and neuropilin-1, with VEGF treatment increasing VEGF promoter activity and VEGF secretion that was attenuated by the Flk-1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ZM 323881. These results demonstrate the presence of an IGF-1 regulated VEGF autocrine loop in HNSCC.
Clinical studies suggest that agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) may exert beneficial effects in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism for the potential therapeutic interest of this class of drugs has not yet been elucidated. Here, in mice overexpressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein, we found that chronic treatment with rosiglitazone, a high-affinity agonist at PPARgamma, facilitated beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) clearance. Rosiglitazone not only reduced Abeta burden in the brain but, importantly, almost completely removed the abundant amyloid plaques observed in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of 13-month-old transgenic mice. In the hippocampus, neuropil threads containing phosphorylated tau, probably corresponding to dystrophic neurites, were also decreased by the drug. Rosiglitazone switched on the activated microglial phenotype, promoting its phagocytic ability, reducing the expression of proinflammatory markers and inducing factors for alternative differentiation. The decreased amyloid pathology may account for the reduction of p-tau-containing neuropil threads and for the rescue of impaired recognition and spatial memory in the transgenic mice. This study provides further insights into the mechanisms for the beneficial effect of rosiglitazone in AD patients.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role during normal embryogenesis, and it has been implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis. Here, we report that Ladybird homeobox 1 (LBX1), a developmentally regulated homeobox gene, directs expression of the known EMT inducers ZEB1, ZEB2, Snail1, and transforming growth factor beta2 (TGFB2). In mammary epithelial cells, overexpression of LBX1 leads to morphological transformation, expression of mesenchymal markers, enhanced cell migration, increased CD44(high)/CD24(low) progenitor cell population, and tumorigenic cooperation with known oncogenes. In human breast cancer, LBX1 is up-regulated in the unfavorable estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone (PR)/HER2 triple-negative basal-like subtype. Thus, aberrant expression of LBX1 may lead to the activation of a developmentally regulated EMT pathway in human breast cancer.
Dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway frequently accounts for the tumorigenesis in head and neck cancer. To develop a new treatment, we investigated the effect of a novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BGT226 (BGT226), in head and neck cancer cells.
The in vitro antitumor effect of BGT226 was determined in various cancer cell lines. Animal models were also applied to examine drug potency. The inhibitory ability of BGT226 on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was analyzed.
The growth inhibition assay revealed that BGT226 was active against all tested cancer cell lines. Cross-resistance was not observed in the cisplatin-resistant cell line. The activation of the AKT/mTOR signal cascade was suppressed by BGT226 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis revealed an accumulation of cells in the G(0)-G(1) phase with concomitant loss in the S-phase. Results of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and the analysis of caspase 3/7 and PARP indicated that BGT226 induced cancer cell death through an apoptosis-independent pathway. BGT226 induced autophagy as indicated by the aggregation and upregulation of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B-II, and p62 degradation. Gene silencing of Beclin1 or cotreatment of the autophagosome inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, inhibited the BGT226-induced autophagy and led to the retrieval of colony survival. In a xenografted animal model, BGT226 significantly delayed tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, along with suppressed cytoplasmic expression of p-p70 S6 kinase and the presence of autophagosome formation.
These data indicate that BGT226 is a potential drug in the treatment of head and neck cancer.
To describe the postmarketing safety data used in the risk assessment of cisapride and to summarize the regulatory actions of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA analyzed reports of patients who developed QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and ventricular arrhythmia in association with the use of cisapride to assess probable etiology and risk factors.
While cisapride was being marketed from 1993-1999, the FDA received reports of the following patients: 117 who developed QT prolongation; 107, torsades de pointes; 16, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; 18, ventricular fibrillation; 27, ventricular tachycardia; 25, cardiac arrest; 16, serious (unspecified) arrhythmia; and 15, sudden death; for a total of 341 individual patients affected, following use of cisapride. Eighty (23%) of the 341 patients died. Deaths were directly or indirectly associated with an arrhythmic event. Factors that suggested an association with cisapride included a temporal relationship between use of cisapride and arrhythmia, the absence of identified risk factors and other explanations for arrhythmia in some patients, and cases of positive dechallenge and rechallenge. In most individuals, the arrhythmia occurred in the presence of risk factors (other drugs and/or medical conditions).
Postmarketing reports and pharmacokinetic and electrophysiological data provided evidence that cisapride is associated with the occurrence of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. The risk of fatal arrhythmia with cisapride was believed to outweigh the benefit for the approved indication, treatment of nocturnal heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, leading to the drug's discontinuation in the United States.
Endocarditis was produced in rabbits with a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate. Subpopulations resistant to other semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins were detected in the isolate. Their presence was probably responsible for the increase in minimum bactericidal concentrations and minimum inhibitory concentrations when tests with high inocula, rather than low inocula were pursued. Rabbits were treated for either 2 or 7 days with nafcillin, cephalothin, cefamandole, vancomycin, rifampin, or gentamicin. Spontaneous death was uncommon in either controls (84% survival) or treated animals (80 to 94% survival). There was no significant difference in the number of bacteria in vegetations of rabbits treated for 7 days with cephalothin, cefamandole, nafcillin, or no antibiotic (control). There was a significant reduction in total bacteria in vegetations of rabbits given vancomycin, gentamicin, or rifampin for 7 days as compared with cephalothin, cefamandole, nafcillin or control. Gentamicin or rifampin sterilized significantly more vegetations after 7 days than cephalothin, cefamandole, nafcillin, or control; rifampin was more effective in sterilizing vegetations than either gentamycin or vancomycin after 2 days. Mutants resistant to 10 mug of rifampin per ml comprised the total bacterial population cultured from vegetations of 2 of 17 rabbits treated with this antibiotic for 7 days; there was no change in the susceptibility of vegetation isolates to other antibiotics. Rifampin, vancomycin, or gentamicin may prove to be more effective in humans than cephalosporins or semisynthetic penicillins in the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis endocarditis.
