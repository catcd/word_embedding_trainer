The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of cefotaxime (CTX) and fosfomycin (FOS), alone or in combination, in an experimental meningitis, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the two antibiotics reproducing those obtained in human CSF during bacterial meningitis. With a dose of 50 mg/kg of CTX and 100 mg/kg of FOS injected i.v. (CTX over 0.5 h and FOS over 3 h), CSF concentrations were comparable to those observed in man. In a series of five rabbits per treatment group, the bacterial population was counted before and after treatment (two doses with a six-hour interval) with CTX, FOS or CTX + FOS (CTX over 0.5 h before the end of FOS infusion). By the 12th hour of treatment, the percentage of bacteria surviving in CSF compared to the initial population was 4.35% for CTX, 0.20% for FOS and 0.19% for CTX + FOS. Thus, it seemed that CTX + FOS was not more active than FOS alone. In another series of four rabbits per group, the bactericidal effect was followed at T0, T6, T12, T24 and T48 after treatment (two doses with a six-hour with a six-hour interval). With CTX, a variable drop in bacterial count from one rabbit to the other occurred during the first 12 h, and then a bacteriostasis followed. With FOS, a quick bactericidal effect was observed during the first 12 h, becoming slower during the following 36 h (0.03% of bacteria surviving at the 48th hour). With CTX and FOS in combination, a quick bactericidal effect was achieved, remaining steady over a 48-hour period (0.001% of bacteria surviving at the 48th hour).
Clinical trials conducted in Western countries have shown that aromatase inhibitors are associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) than tamoxifen in postmenopausal early breast cancer. Because pharmacogenetic differences in drug-metabolizing genes may cause ethnic differences, assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of aromatase inhibitors in non-white women is warranted. This open-label, randomized clinical trial included 706 postmenopausal Japanese women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, who had received tamoxifen for 1 to 4 years as adjuvant therapy. This study was closed early after entry of approximately 28% of the initially planned patients. They were randomly assigned to either switch to anastrozole or to continue tamoxifen for total treatment duration of 5 years. Primary endpoints were DFS and adverse events. At a median follow-up of 42 months, the unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.14; P = 0.14) for DFS and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.29-1.02; P = 0.06) for relapse-free survival (RFS), both in favor of anastrozole. The incidence of thromboembolic events in the tamoxifen group and bone fractures in the anastrozole group was not excessively high. Switching from tamoxifen to anastrozole was likely to decrease disease recurrence in postmenopausal Japanese breast cancer patients. Ethnic differences in major adverse events may be attributable to a low baseline risk of these events in Japanese.
A genome-wide association scan of approximately 6.6 million genotyped or imputed variants in 882 Sardinian individuals with multiple sclerosis (cases) and 872 controls suggested association of CBLB gene variants with disease, which was confirmed in 1,775 cases and 2,005 controls (rs9657904, overall P = 1.60 x 10(-10), OR = 1.40). CBLB encodes a negative regulator of adaptive immune responses, and mice lacking the ortholog are prone to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the animal model of multiple sclerosis.
Abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are well documented in men using illicit drugs and/or infected with HIV; however, less is known about HPA function, or the health consequence of HPA dysfunction, in their female counterparts. People with depression exhibit hypercortisolemia, and depression is common in people with HIV or substance use problems. The current study investigated cortisol secretion in 209 demographically matched men and women, stratified by their HIV and drug use status. Self-reported depressive symptoms were evaluated using a standardized, validated questionnaire (CES-D). Women reported more depressive symptoms than men (p=.01). Male and female drug users exhibited higher cortisol concentrations (p=.03), and were more likely to report depressive symptoms (p=.04), than non-users. Depression was related to elevated cortisol concentrations for the study population (p=.03), and women with elevated cortisol concentrations were significantly more depressed than all other participants (p=.05). While it is unknown whether high cortisol concentrations precede depressive symptoms or vice versa, these data indicate that higher cortisol concentrations are associated with depressive symptoms in heroin and cocaine users, and that this association is more pronounced in women than men. HIV status did not act in an additive or synergistic way with drug use for either cortisol or CES-D measures in the current study. Unique therapies to treat the endocrine and mental health consequences of illicit drug use in men and women deserve consideration as depressive symptoms, and high cortisol concentrations associated with depressive symptoms, differ by gender.
Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disease with a complex genetic etiology. Here, through a genome-wide association study of rheumatoid arthritis, we identified a polymorphism in CCR6, the gene encoding chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 6 (a surface marker for Th17 cells) at 6q27, that was associated with rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility and was validated in two independent replication cohorts from Japan (rs3093024, a total of 7,069 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (cases) and 20,727 controls, overall odds ratio = 1.19, P = 7.7 x 10(-19)). We identified a triallelic dinucleotide polymorphism of CCR6 (CCR6DNP) in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs3093024 that showed effects on gene transcription. The CCR6DNP genotype was correlated with the expression level of CCR6 and was associated with the presence of interleukin-17 (IL-17) in the sera of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, CCR6DNP was associated with susceptibility to Graves' and Crohn's diseases. These results suggest that CCR6 is critically involved in IL-17-driven autoimmunity in human diseases.
To identify new genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis, we conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 5,539 autoantibody-positive individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (cases) and 20,169 controls of European descent, followed by replication in an independent set of 6,768 rheumatoid arthritis cases and 8,806 controls. Of 34 SNPs selected for replication, 7 new rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles were identified at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in an analysis of all 41,282 samples. The associated SNPs are near genes of known immune function, including IL6ST, SPRED2, RBPJ, CCR6, IRF5 and PXK. We also refined associations at two established rheumatoid arthritis risk loci (IL2RA and CCL21) and confirmed the association at AFF3. These new associations bring the total number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci to 31 among individuals of European ancestry. An additional 11 SNPs replicated at P < 0.05, many of which are validated autoimmune risk alleles, suggesting that most represent genuine rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles.
The extract of Curcuma longa, better known as turmeric, was orally administered to experimental rats that were fed a high-cholesterol diet to investigate whether it could regulate plasma lipids and cholesterol levels and possibly improve hepatic conditions. With turmeric supplements, rats showed a significant decrease in total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with rats that were fed a high-cholesterol diet alone. Fatty liver developed in hypercholesterolemic rats with the high-cholesterol diet treatment, and this condition was markedly improved when rats were provided with turmeric supplements at 100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg of body mass. The turmeric treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the total amount of hepatic lipid. Histological staining of liver tissues with Sudan III and hematoxylin showed that rats fed with a high-cholesterol diet alone had more and larger granular fat bodies than rats having turmeric extract supplementation in their high-cholesterol diet. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the expression levels of enzymes involved in fat metabolism and cellular homeostasis in experimental rat livers. The results showed that rats fed a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with turmeric extract had a significant increase in the expression of cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase, hemeoxygenase 1, and low-density lipoprotein receptors but a significant decrease in 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase level when compared with rats fed a normal or high-cholesterol diet, showing that turmeric prevents hypercholesterolemia and the formation of fatty liver by the modulation of expressions of enzymes that are important to cholesterol metabolism.
  Turmeric may be considered a functional food for regulating plasma cholesterol levels and preventing the development of fatty liver in people who frequently consume a high-cholesterol diet.
A diet fortified with calcium carbonate has been reported to reduce blood pressure in low-renin and salt-sensitive hypertensive patients. We have therefore examined the effect of increased dietary calcium on the development of reduced renal mass-saline hypertension in rats, a classical, low-renin, volume, and sodium-dependent model of hypertension. Rats with 70-75% reduction in renal mass were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental rats were fed a sodium-free diet supplemented with calcium carbonate (2.0% calcium) and drank 1% saline for 5 weeks. Control rats consumed the salt-free diet and drank 1% saline for the same period. In control rats, as previously observed, blood pressure progressive increased from a control value of 120.0 +/- 1.2 to 174.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg by the fifth week. In contrast, in the calcium-supplemented rats the development of hypertension was significantly attenuated; the blood pressure only increased from 117.0 +/- 1.2 to 134.0 +/- 3.8 mm Hg by the fifth week. This was associated with a 30% decrease in saline intake by the fifth week, with proportionate decreases in urine volume and sodium excretion but not potassium excretion. Urinary magnesium excretion increased. No such changes were seen in control rats. At the end of the treatment period, plasma levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, BUN, and protein were not different, but plasma chloride and magnesium were lower in experimental rats; vascular smooth muscle cell membrane potentials were also not different. These data show that dietary calcium carbonate can attenuate the development of reduced renal mass-saline hypertension in the rat, possibly in part by altering sodium and water intake.
The study presents the case of a 78-year-old woman with recurrent pulmonary embolism, treated with 2 courses of thrombolysis. In this patient, due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, fondaparinux therapy was used.
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by painful, recurrent attacks of inflammation affecting the hands, feet, face, abdomen, urogenital tract, and the larynx. The inflammation can be disfiguring, debilitating, quite painful, and, in the case of laryngeal attacks, life-threatening. Attacks are frequently the source of unnecessary exploratory abdominal procedures, extended hospital stays affecting a patient's ability to retain employment, and severe compromise of the patient's quality of life. HAE is estimated to affect 10,000 people in the US and is caused by deficient or dysfunctional C1-inhibitor, a naturally occurring molecule that is known to inhibit kallikrein, bradykinin, and other serine proteases in plasma. The treatment and management of HAE have been hampered by the dearth of safe and effective therapies. In the United States, there are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of acute HAE attacks. Although prophylactic HAE therapies do exist, they are often viewed as suboptimal due to moderate degrees of efficacy and the existence of adverse effects associated with therapy. Danazol, an attenuated androgen, is the most commonly prescribed prophylaxis treatment for HAE in the United States. Although it has demonstrated moderate efficacy in the prevention of HAE attacks, danazol's side-effect profile can be problematic because there is a correlation between frequency and severity of adverse events and dosage and duration of therapy.
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Successful treatment of breast cancer relies on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer initiation and progression. Recent studies have suggested a crucial role of perturbations in ferritin levels and tightly associated with this, the deregulation of intracellular iron homeostasis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms for the cancer-linked ferritin alterations remain largely unknown and often with conflicting conclusions. Therefore, this study was undertaken to define the role of ferritin in breast cancer. We determined that human breast cancer cells with an epithelial phenotype, such as MCF-7, MDA-MB-361, T-47D, HCC70 and cells, expressed low levels of ferritin light chain, ferritin heavy chain, transferrin, transferring receptor, and iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2. In contrast, expression of these proteins was substantially elevated in breast cancer cells with an aggressive mesenchymal phenotype, such as Hs-578T, BT-549, and especially MDA-MB-231 cells. The up-regulation of ferritin light chain and ferritin heavy chain in MDA-MB-231 cells was accompanied by alterations in the subcellular distribution of these proteins as characterized by an increased level of nuclear ferritin and a lower level of the cellular labile iron pool as compared to MCF-7 cells. We established that ferritin heavy chain is a target of miRNA miR-200b, suggesting that its up-regulation in MDA-MB-231 cells may be triggered by the low expression of miR-200b. Ectopic up-regulation of miR-200b by transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells with miR-200b substantially decreased the level of ferritin heavy chain. More importantly, miR-200b-induced down-regulation of ferritin was associated with an increased sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. These results suggest that perturbations in ferritin levels are associated with the progression of breast cancer toward a more advanced malignant phenotype.
Citalopram, in European studies, has shown some early promise for treatment of poststroke depression and behavioral complications of dementia. An open pilot study of citalopram was conducted in 16 patients with dementia and behavioral disturbances. Citalopram was well tolerated by 13 of the patients, and 9 had a clinically impressive response. A significant overall mean reduction in disruptive vocalizations was observed by means of a novel technique of computer-assisted real-time observation. The mean citalopram plasma level-to-dose ratio was found to be twice that previously reported in younger patients. These pilot findings should encourage future placebo concentration-controlled trials.
The authors describe major depression with delusions occurring for the first time in an elderly man receiving metoclopramide and review the literature concerning metoclopramide and depression.
The effects of carbidopa combined with levodopa (carbidopa/levodopa) and levodopa alone on the cardiovascular system of patients with Parkinson's disease were evaluated. Thirty-eight patients who had been on stable doses of levodopa underwent a complete cardiac examination, including measurement of recumbent and erect blood pressure and 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients were classified with respect to the presence or absence of clinically significant heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias. Nineteen of the 38 patients (50 percent) had heart disease, and 12 (32 percent) had significant ventricular arrhythmias. Eleven of the 12 with arrhythmias had underlying heart disease. The incidence of arrhythmias did not correlate with the dose of levodopa. The patients were subsequently randomly assigned to treatment groups receiving either carbidopa/levodopa or levodopa alone. There was no significant difference in the severity of ventricular arrhythmias or in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension in the group assigned to carbidopa/levodopa compared with the group receiving levodopa.
In a prospective study the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), systolic blood pressure, ECG, and heart rate were recorded at rest and during submaximal work to compare the cardiotoxic effect of epirubicin with a combination chemotherapy without known cardiotoxicity. A total of 14 females with advanced breast cancer were treated with epirubicin at a median cumulative dose of 827 mg/m2 (range, 550-1244). These patients had previously received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) or cyclophosphamide alone as adjuvant treatment, or CMF for advanced disease. The control group consisted of 11 females with advanced breast cancer given CMF only. The systolic blood pressure at rest as well as during submaximal work was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) after treatment in the epirubicin group than in the CMF controls. With regard to LVEF, the median value of 54% at rest was significantly lower after treatment in the epirubicin group than in the controls (59%). There was a significant fall in LVEF at rest and during exercise in the epirubicin group, whereas no such changes were found in the CMF controls after treatment. The RVEF was unaffected. In the epirubicin-treated group one patient developed fatal congestive heart failure, and in the remaining 13 patients treatment was discontinued due to progression of the cancer and not to cardiotoxicity. Thus, the cardiotoxicity of epirubicin changed the clinical outcome in only 1 of 14 patients with advanced breast cancer.
We investigated whether triazolam attenuated the suppression of motility in the conditioned fear stress task in mice and whether ethanol modified the effects of triazolam. When mice were placed 24 hours later (retention test) in the same environment in which they had previously been exposed to an electric foot shock (training), they exhibited a marked suppression of motility (conditioned fear stress). Triazolam (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), administered before training, attenuated the suppression of motility in the conditioned fear stress task in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the sensitivity to an electric foot shock. The doses of triazolam that attenuated the suppression of motility were much lower that those of chlordiazepoxide (5-10 mg/kg, s.c.). Neither drug, administered before the retention test, attenuated the suppression of motility in the conditioned fear stress task. These results suggest that both benzodiazepines may inhibit the process of acquisition, but not the process of recall, of memory. Ethanol (1 g/kg, p.o.), which, by itself, did not affect either the suppression of motility or the sensitivity to an electric foot shock, exacerbated the attenuation of the suppression of motility in the conditioned fear stress task induced by both triazolam (0.01 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). These results suggest that ethanol exacerbates the effects of benzodiazepines.
Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic disease of small- and medium-sized arteries, involving one or more vascular beds. Patients may present with a range of symptoms, which may not readily lead to a diagnosis of FMD. While maternal cocaine abuse during pregnancy has previously been associated with vascular alterations in the fetus, an association specifically with FMD has not previously been described.
In this case report, a 21-month-old male presented with a 3-week history of daily vomiting, with temporary improvement of symptoms, then relapse followed by loss of consciousness. His medical history was significant only for maternal cocaine use. Clinical evaluation revealed dilated cardiomyopathy, and a presumptive diagnosis of myocarditis was rendered. Respiratory arrest and death occurred 2 days after admission. Postmortem examination demonstrated intimal-type multivessel FMD, which was determined to be the cause of the clinical presentation.
Without a postmortem examination, it is unlikely that a diagnosis of intimal fibroplasia, a rare variant of FMD (5% of cases), would have been made. This case thus illustrates the continuing utility of the classic postmortem examination. More intriguingly, the case suggests a possible relationship between in utero cocaine exposure and the development of fibromuscular dysplasia in the child.
Troglitazone is a potent agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) that is a ligand-activated transcription factor regulating cell differentiation and growth. PPARgamma may play a role in thyroid carcinogenesis since PAX8-PPARgamma1 chromosomal translocations are commonly found in follicular thyroid cancers. We investigated the antiproliferative and redifferentiation effects of troglitazone in 6 human thyroid cancer cell lines: TPC-1 (papillary), FTC-133, FTC-236, FTC-238 (follicular), XTC-1 (Hürthle cell), and ARO82-1 (anaplastic) cell lines. PPARgamma was expressed variably in these cell lines. FTC-236 and FTC-238 had a rearranged chromosome at 3p25, possibly implicating the involvement of the PPARgamma encoding gene whereas the other cell lines did not. Troglitazone significantly inhibited cell growth by cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. PPARgamma overexpression did not appear to be a prerequisite for a response to treatment with troglitazone. Troglitazone also downregulated surface expression of CD97, a novel dedifferentiation marker, in FTC-133 cells and upregulated sodium iodide symporter (NIS) mRNA in TPC-1 and FTC-133 cells. Our investigations document that human thyroid cancer cell lines commonly express PPARgamma, but chromosomal translocations involving PPARgamma are uncommon. Troglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, induced antiproliferation and redifferentiation in thyroid cancer cell lines. PPARgamma agonists may therefore be effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with thyroid cancer that fails to respond to traditional treatments.
Endothelin-1 infusion into humans to obtain pathophysiological plasma levels causes mild hypertension, strong renal vasoconstriction, and sodium retention. We studied whether oral use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (20 mg BID) or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (60 mg OD) could attenuate these effects of endothelin-1 (2.5 ng/kg per minute for 90 minutes) in six healthy volunteers. Endothelin infusion alone increased plasma endothelin from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 8.8 +/- 1.0 pmol/L (P < .05). Blood pressure rose by approximately 6 mm Hg (P < .05). Renal function changes were relatively large: Renal blood flow decreased from 941 +/- 76 to 729 +/- 118 mL/min (P < .05) and glomerular filtration rate from 105 +/- 9 to 92 +/- 10 mL/min (P < .05); renal vascular resistance increased from 101 +/- 7 to 152 +/- 20 mm Hg.min/L (P < .05); and sodium excretion decreased from 158 +/- 54 to 86 +/- 27 mumol/min (P < .05). Enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure from 94 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 3 mm Hg (P < .05) and prevented the hypertensive response to endothelin. By contrast, despite renal predilatation, endothelin reduced renal blood flow strongly (from 1063 +/- 127 to 763 +/- 100 mL/min, P < .05), although maximal renal vascular resistance was numerically lower (124 +/- 11 mm Hg.min/L) than during endothelin alone (P < .05). Glomerular filtration rate fell from 118 +/- 11 to 108 +/- 11 mL/min (P < .05). Enalapril did not alter the antinatriuretic effect of endothelin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The degree and duration of miosis, induced by low doses of parenteral morphine (65 mcg/Kg i.m.) before and after ten days of naloxone treatment, were evaluated in eleven volunteers affected by migraine without aura. Morphine induced miosis was significantly more intense and persistent after chronic naloxone treatment than before the drug was administered. In another group of seven volunteers suffering from migraine without aura, no differences between morphine-induced miosis, prior to and after a ten-day treatment with placebo, were observed. In addition, a third group of fifty-four subjects, suffering from migraine without aura, underwent three-month naloxone treatment (150 mcg/Kg/i.m./day). All subjects included in the third group, were partially or totally refractory to conventional therapy. Pupillopharmacological results indicate that the benefit gained from chronic administration of the opiate antagonist may be related to some type of naloxone-induced supersensitivity of the opioid receptor population.
The uterine and cardiovascular responses to the adrenergic beta2-receptor stimulator terbutaline (TRB) were investigated in 14 patients in normal term labor. TRB, administered intravenously at a rate of 10 to 20 mug per minute, effectively inhibited uterine activity in advanced labor and also expulsion. Intravenous injection of TRB, 250 mug, diminished oxytocin-induced uterine hyperactivity. No serious side effects of the drug were observed; the circulatory effects were minimal, except for a tolerable maternal tachycardia. The mode of action and clinical application of TRB for inhibition of unwanted uterine activity are discussed.
Two hundred and six patients with rheumatoid arthritis were examined for their association with the subtypes of Gc (vitamin D binding protein). In patient groups there is 11% excess of individuals with Gc*2 allele compared to the control group, giving a relative risk of 1.55. This risk increases with the humoral status of the individual. A possible physiological basis between the association of vitamin D binding protein and rheumatoid arthritis is discussed.
To perform an open-label, randomized, controlled trial comparing treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) with two multidrug regimens (MDRs) for advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).
Eight hundred seven patients with advanced HL (stage III to IV, or earlier stage with systemic symptoms or bulky disease) were randomly assigned between ABVD and MDR specified before randomization as alternating chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisolone (ChlVPP) with prednisolone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and etoposide (PABIOE), or hybrid ChlVPP/etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin (EVA). Radiotherapy was planned for incomplete response or initial bulk disease.
At 52 months median follow-up, 212 event-free survival (EFS) events (disease progression or any death) were reported. In the primary comparison, at 3 years EFS was 75% (95% CI, 71% to 79%) for ABVD and 75% (95% CI, 70% to 79%) for MDRs (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.37; HR more than 1.0 favors ABVD). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 90% (95% CI, 87% to 93%) in patients allocated ABVD and 88% (95% CI, 84% to 91%) in patients allocated MDRs (HR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.77). Patients receiving MDRs experienced more grade 3/4 infection, mucositis, and neuropathy. One occurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome was reported, but no acute leukemia was reported. When the two MDRs are compared separately with ABVD, neither the alternating nor the hybrid regimen showed a statistically significant difference from ABVD for EFS or OS. Subgroup analysis suggested that MDRs may be associated with poorer outcomes in older patients (heterogeneity test of OS older or younger than 45 years, P = .020).
There was no evidence of significant difference in EFS or OS between ABVD and MDRs in the trial overall or if the two MDR versus ABVD comparisons are considered separately. ABVD remains the standard for treatment of advanced HL.
Mutated Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) was the first proven cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and was the basis for the first animal model. Many approaches, including transgenic and knock-out animals, cell models, and in vitro studies using recombinant hSOD1 mutants and wild-type, have been employed in an attempt to elucidate the gained toxic function. However, a thorough characterization of the properties of hSOD1 mutants produced in vivo has yet to be carried out, primarily due to the lack of a procedure capable of purifying the enzyme from relevant tissues in a manner that avoids potential artifacts. Here we report a new, one-step purification procedure using a semi-preparative polymeric reversed-phase HPLC system, which yields greater than 99% pure enzyme from the spinal cord, and >95% pure from brain, heart, and kidney. This novel approach for purifying 'in vivo expressed' native dimeric SOD1 will facilitate the determination of the true 'as isolated' properties of the enzyme that is responsible for disease, devoid of any expression system, or harsh purification, artifacts. An important new finding related to the specific activity of human SOD1 (normalized to copper content) is also discussed.
To report a case of recurrent pentamidine-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) and to review previously reported cases in the literature.
Medical records of the subject patient, case reports, and relevant studies identified by MEDLINE.
Data were abstracted from pertinent published sources by one author and reviewed by the remaining authors.
A 43-year-old woman with AIDS experienced pentamidine-induced TdP. TdP and other cardiac arrhythmias recurred repeatedly for 13 days after pentamidine therapy was discontinued and in the presence of normal magnesium and potassium serum concentrations. Infusions of magnesium, lidocaine, and isoproterenol were used to treat the arrhythmias. The exact mechanism of pentamidine-induced TdP has not been clearly established. It is postulated, however, that the similarity of pentamidine's structure to procainamide may contribute to its proarrhythmic effects. The tissue-binding capacity of pentamidine may result in a prolongation of its effects. No distinctive characteristic appears to predispose people to the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Laboratory values that should be monitored include serum magnesium, potassium, and creatinine. The corrected QT interval also should be monitored.
Recurrent arrhythmias may be seen for many days after intravenous administration of pentamidine has been discontinued. Clinicians should consider this phenomenon as they decide how to monitor patients who have received this drug.
A 2-year-old boy developed the Fanconi syndrome 1 year after being treated successfully for a neuroblastoma. This is probably an unusual complication of ifosfamide.
