When used in the treatment of hypertension propranolol is at least of similar potency to bethanidine, guanethidine, and methyldopa. Propranolol does not produce postural or exercise hypotension and it seems that it is often more acceptable to patients than conventional drugs. It usually produces the best control of the supine blood pressure.A series of 109 hypertensive patients was treated with propranolol; in nine the drug was withdrawn. In 92 of the patients a supine or standing blood pressure of 100 mm. Hg or less was achieved. Eighty of the patients had previously been treated with other potent drugs, and close comparisons and prolonged follow-up in 17 patients showed that diastolic pressures of 100 mm. Hg or less were achieved in more patients after propranolol than with guanethidine, bethanidine, or methyldopa.Sensitivity to propranolol varies widely, and dosage should be increased gradually. The hypotensive effect often takes six to eight weeks to reach its maximum. Propranolol reduces cardiac output but may also act by reducing the cardiac component of pressor stimuli; as a result the baroreceptors gradually regulate the blood pressure at a lower level. It is contraindicated in patients with obstructive airways disease or in uncompensated heart failure.
Lindane (gamma-HCH) was examined for its effect on primordial germ cell (PGC) development in the mouse embryo. We found that exposure by gavage of pregnant mice to 15 or 30 mg/kg/bw lindane during the period of PGC migration and gonad colonization (from 8.5 to 11.5 days post coitum, dpc) resulted in a significant reduction of the number of germ cells within 12.5 dpc testis and ovaries (a maximum of about 25 and 40%, respectively). Similarly, lindane caused a dose-dependent decrease of the PGC number in an in vitro culture model. Further experiments showed that in such model, lindane induced features of apoptotic cell death in PGCs such as increase in caspase-3 activity, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) positivity. A marked increase of the number of PGCs positive for TUNEL staining was also observed in 12.5 dpc gonads of embryos from pregnant mice subjected one day before to acute lindane treatment (60 mg/kg/bw). Finally, we show that a brief incubation of isolated PGCs with 10(-5)M lindane resulted in a marked decrease of the basal and kit-ligand-induced phosphorylation level of the AKT kinase, known to be crucial for PGC survival. Taken together these results demonstrate that embryo exposure to lindane during early stages of gametogenesis can severely impair the number of germ cells in the fetal gonads; the compound appears to affect PGC survival through a direct proapoptotic action likely resulting from its adverse effect on AKT activity in such cells.
The nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) 1-, 2-, and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene, 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[e]pyrene, 2- and 3-nitrofluoranthene, 9-nitrodibenz[a,c]anthracene, and two of the parent PAHs fluoranthene and dibenz[a,c]anthracene were tested for tumorigenicity in the neonatal male B6C3F1 mouse. 6-Nitrochrysene was used as a positive control. Mice were administered three intraperitoneal injections of test agent (400 nmol total) on 1, 8, and 15 days after birth and evaluated for liver and lung tumors at 12 months of age. 2-Nitrobenzo[a]pyrene and 6-nitrochrysene induced a high incidence of liver tumors (91-100%), while the remaining test compounds did not induce tumors at a rate significantly higher than the solvent control. 6-Nitrochrysene was the only test agent to produce a significant increase in the frequency of lung tumors. K- and H-ras mutations were analyzed in liver tumors of treated mice and mainly occurred at the first base of K-ras codon 13, resulting in GGC --> CGC transversion. Since most of the tested nitro-PAHs are mutagens in vitro, the results of this study indicate that the in vitro mutagenicity of these compounds does not correlate with their tumorigenicity in the neonatal B6C3F1 mouse bioassay. Also, the results indicate that liver tumors from mice treated with nitro-PAHs possess ras mutations typical of PAHs and their derivatives.
Sudden death was recorded by continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring in a 62 year old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, who had been treated for four days with verapamil 360 mg orally. Analysis of the tape showed a third degree atrioventricular block followed by complete asystole. The sudden death could be related to treatment with verapamil.
Fifty consecutive unselected patients referred for myeloradiculography and examined by the same radiologist, when facilities for measuring the visual evoked response were available, are considered. The effect on the visual evoked response of the examination and the incidence of headache following the use of iohexol as the contrast medium are compared with those after the use of iopamidol and metrizamide reported in a previous study. A total of 400 cases examined with iopamidol and 200 cases examined with iohexol are reviewed with regard to the incidence of headache. Whereas iopamidol and, to a greater extent metrizamide, were found to cause significant lengthening of the visual evoked response latency 20 hours after the radiological examination, iohexol did not. Furthermore there was no significant difference in the 20 hour reading following the use of iohexol compared with the original control group of patients who underwent lumbar puncture alone. There was a lower incidence and severity of headache following the use of iohexol than with iopamidol and a markedly reduced incidence compared with metrizamide. Iohexol is considered less neurotoxic than iopamidol which had previously superceded metrizamide as the contrast medium used for myeloradiculography in the Royal Surrey County Hospital. Volumes of up to 14 ml of iohexol 300 mg I/ml have been used for lumbar radiculography and for total myelography and up to 10 ml for direct lateral cervical puncture. In 350 cases examined to date with iohexol the only serious sequel was a case of chemical meningitis following the lumbar injection of 10 ml of the 300 mg I/ml solution for a cervical examination. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) induces an autoimmune nephritis in the Brown Norway (BN) rats characterized by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-GBM Ab) deposition, proteinuria and a severe interstitial nephritis, all evident at day 13 of the disease. We assessed the effects of all-trans retinoic acid (at-RA) in this experimental model. At-RA is a vitamin A metabolite which has shown beneficial effects on several nephropathies, even though no clear targets for at-RA were provided.
We separated animals in four different experimental groups (HgCl2, HgCl2+at-RA, at-RA and vehicle). From each animal we collected, at days 0 and 13, numerous biological samples: urine, to measure proteinuria by colorimetry; blood to determine VLA-4 expression by flow citometry; renal tissue to study the expression of VCAM-1 by Western blot, the presence of cellular infiltrates by immunohistochemistry, the IgG deposition by immunofluorescence, and the cytokines expression by RT-PCR. Additionally, adhesion assays to VCAM-1 were performed using K562 alpha4 transfectant cells. ANOVA tests were used for statistical significance estimation.
We found that at-RA significantly decreased the serum levels of anti-GBM and consequently its deposition along the glomerular membrane. At-RA markedly reduced proteinuria as well as the number of cellular infiltrates in the renal interstitium, the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta cytokines and VCAM-1 expression in renal tissue. Moreover, we reported here for the first time in an in vivo model that at-RA reduced, to basal levels, the expression of VLA-4 (alpha4beta1) integrin induced by mercury on peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). In addition, using K562 alpha4 stable transfectant cells, we found that at-RA inhibited VLA-4 dependent cell adhesion to VCAM-1.
Here we demonstrate a therapeutic effect of at-RA on an autoimmune experimental nephritis model in rats. We report a significant reduction of the VLA-4 integrin expression on PBLs as well as the inhibition of the VLA4/VCAM1-dependent leukocyte adhesion by at-RA treatment. Thereby we point out the VLA-4 integrin as a target for at-RA in vivo.
Persistent macrophage accumulation and alveolar enlargement are hallmark features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A role for CD8(+) lymphocytes in the development of COPD is suggested based on observations that this T cell subset is increased in the airways and parenchyma of smokers that develop COPD with airflow limitation. In this study, we utilize a mouse model of COPD to examine the contributions of CD8(+) T cells in the persistent macrophage accumulation and airspace enlargement resulting from chronic irritant exposure.
We analyzed pulmonary inflammation and alveolar destruction in wild-type and Cd8-deficient mice chronically exposed to acrolein, a potent respiratory tract irritant. We further examined cytokine mRNA expression levels by RNase protection assay, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity by gelatin zymography, and epithelial cell apoptosis by active caspase3 immunohistochemistry in wild-type and Cd8-deficient mice exposed chronically to acrolein.
These studies demonstrate that CD8(+) T cells are important mediators of macrophage accumulation in the lung and the progressive airspace enlargement in response to chronic acrolein exposures. The expression of several inflammatory cytokines (IP-10, IFN-gamma, IL-12, RANTES, and MCP-1), MMP2 and MMP9 gelatinase activity, and caspase3 immunoreactivity in pulmonary epithelial cells were attenuated in the Cd8-deficient mice compared to wild-type.
These results indicate that CD8(+) T cells actively contribute to macrophage accumulation and the development of irritant-induced airspace enlargement.
The zinc finger E-box binding transcription factor ZEB1 (deltaEF1/Nil-2-a/AREB6/zfhx1a/TCF8/zfhep/BZP) is emerging as an important regulator of the epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) required for development and cancer metastasis. ZEB1 promotes EMT by repressing genes contributing to the epithelial phenotype while activating those associated with the mesenchymal phenotype. TCF8 (zfhx1a), the gene encoding ZEB1, is induced by several potentially oncogenic ligands including TGF-beta, estrogen, and progesterone. TGF-beta appears to activate EMT, at least in part, by inducing ZEB1. However, our understanding of how ZEB1 contributes to signaling pathways elicited by estrogen and progesterone is quite limited, as is our understanding of its functional roles in normal adult tissues. To begin to address these questions, a human tissue mRNA array analysis was done. In adults, the highest ZEB1 mRNA expression is in bladder and uterus, whereas in the fetus highest expression is in lung, thymus, and heart. To further investigate the regulation of TCF8 by estrogen, ZEB1 mRNA was measured in ten estrogen-responsive cell lines, but it is only induced in the OV266 ovarian carcinoma line. Although high expression of ZEB1 mRNA is estrogen-dependent in normal human ovarian and endometrial biopsies, high expression is estrogen-independent in late stage ovarian and endometrial carcinomas, raising the possibility that deregulated expression promotes cancer progression. In contrast, TCF8 is at least partially deleted in 4 of 5 well-differentiated, grade I endometrial carcinomas, which may contribute to their non-aggressive phenotype. These data support the contention that high ZEB1 encourages gynecologic carcinoma progression.
Diphenylhydantoin (DFH) is known to yield cerebellar ataxia in chronically treated epileptic patient due to cerebellar atrophy with loss of Purkinje cells. Little attention has been paid in the literature to the acute DFH intoxication bearing cerebellar symptoms. We report a patient afflicted with complex partial seizures due to a left temporal cyst, who has been treated during the last two years with DFH 100 mg/day. Due to the refractory characteristics of his seizures he was put on DFH 400 mg daily, and developed a pancerebellar syndrome. After surgical removal of the cyst his seizures entirely faded away and his cerebellar signs improved. Nevertheless his neurological examination still showed trunkal and lower limbs ataxia. After one year of follow up his neurological picture did not change, while he was seizures free. TC and MRI did not show cerebellar atrophy.
Amidarone (AMD) is an antiarrhythmic drug with side effects on the nervous system. Cerebellum is seldom involved: We describe the case of a 56 years old male patient with a history of 4 month of cerebellar involvement characterized by gait unsteadiness, ataxia, nistagmus and vertigo. He was on treatment with AMD because of ventricular arrythmia. The cerebellar syndrome progressively disappeared after drug withdrawal and he was symptoms-free 4 months later. Similar symptoms appeared after another one month of automedication with the same drug. Structural lesions, metabolic, nutritional deficiencies or toxics were excluded. Mechanisms of cerebellar toxicity of AMD are yet unknown. The knowledge of the toxic effects of this drug, widely used in our country, would allow its early recognition.
This study examines cases of chronic drug users who died suddenly after drug administration. Victims were young subjects, aged from 19 to 35 from Switzerland and known to the police as long-term drug users. The circumstances of death suggested the occurrence of a sudden, unexpected death. Some victims were undergoing methadone treatment. In each case, a forensic autopsy and toxicological analyses were performed at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Lausanne in Switzerland between 2002 and 2004, including hair analysis as a means to establish chronic drug use in general, and cocaine use in particular. The conduction system was examined histologically and cases showing potentially lethal changes were chosen for this report. The most frequent lesions found were severe thickening of the atrioventricular node artery, intranodal and perinodal fibrosis, and microscopic foci of chronic inflammatory infiltration. The authors conclude that pathological lesions in the conduction tissue may play a role in the occurrence of death attributed to intoxication consecutive to cocaine ingestion.
1. This complex of symptoms appears to be congenital, familial, and hereditary. It is apparently transmitted by a dominant gene, probably on chromosome 5. 2. Hypertonicity with rigidity of all voluntary muscles usually presents at birth. 3. Feeding problems are due to dysphagia or laryngospasm associated with aspiration and dyspnea. 4. Respiratory problems are characterized by apneic episodes due to muscle spasm. 5. Prolonged episodes of muscular rigidity secondary to sudden stimuli result in frequent falls, characteristically en bloc, like a statue. 6. Continuous electromyographic activity even at rest (with absence of fasciculations) improves after intravenous diazepam.
To test the hypothesis that the retinamide N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (fenretinide) would be clinically active potentially via receptor-independent apoptosis and receptor-dependent effects in natural retinoid-resistant oral leukoplakia patients--the first test of this hypothesis in any in vivo setting.
A phase II trial of fenretinide (200 mg/d for 3 months) in oral leukoplakia patients who had not responded (de novo resistance) or who had responded and then relapsed (acquired resistance) to previous treatment with natural retinoids. We analyzed apoptosis via the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling in situ DNA fragmentation assay.
We accrued 35 evaluable patients with retinoid-resistant oral leukoplakia, 12 (34.3%) had partial responses to fenretinide (95% confidence interval, 19.2-52.4%), and response was associated with acquired resistance to natural retinoids (P = 0.015, Fisher's exact test). Nine responders progressed within 9 months of stopping fenretinide. Toxicity was minimal and compliance was excellent. Mean apoptosis values (SE) increased from 0.35% (0.25%) at baseline to 1.18% (0.64%) at 3 months (P = 0.001, sign test); this increase did not correlate with clinical response. The increases in 3-month mean serum concentrations of fenretinide (0.23 micromol/L) and N-(4-methoxyphenyl)retinamide (0.57 micromol/L) correlated with decreased retinol concentrations [Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.57 (P = 0.001) and -0.43 (P = 0.01), respectively].
Low-dose fenretinide was clinically active and produced a small increase in apoptosis in retinoid-resistant oral leukoplakia.
In this report, we describe a fatal case of pontine hemorrhage related with methamphetamine abuse. A 54-year-old male was found dead in a prone position in his parents' house, and a medico-legal autopsy was carried out to determine the cause of his death. Externally, although an injection mark-like injury with subcutaneous hemorrhage was observed in the left cubital fossa, the autopsy revealed no severe trauma leading to death. Internally, every organ was moderately congested. The brain weighed 1330 g. Macroscopically, there was no vascular abnormality such as aneurysm or malformation. In the sections of the brain stem, a massive hematoma occupied the central area of the pons. Drug screening test using Triage was weakly positive for amphetamines. Moreover, in the blood and urine samples, methamphetamine was quantitatively detected at concentrations of 0.4 and 0.6 mg/l, respectively, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Other drugs and poison were not detected in the blood and urine samples collected at autopsy. Histopathologically, necrotizing angiitis characterized by fibrinoid necrosis of the intima and media was observed with cell infiltration. Thus, the pontine hemorrhage seemingly resulted from methamphetamine-induced angiitis, with an acute elevation of blood pressure after methamphetamine abuse.
Several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). Two common variants of the CYP2C9 gene (CYP2C9*2 and *3) were reported to significantly affect the activity of the CYP2C9 enzyme. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CYP2C9 polymorphisms on the risk of gastroduodenal bleeding in acute NSAID users.
This case-control study included 26 patients with endoscopically documented NSAID-related gastroduodenal bleeding lesions and 52 age-, sex- and NSAID use-matched controls with no lesions at endoscopy. Both cases and controls were Helicobacter pylori negative and acute users of an NSAID or cycloxygenase-2 inhibitor that undergoes CYP2C9 metabolism (ie, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, or piroxicam). Two marker single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene, identifying the CYP2C9 *2 and *3 allele, were evaluated in all subjects.
Setting the CYP2C9*1/*1 wild type as reference, significantly higher frequencies of CYP2C9*1/*3 (34.6% vs 5.8%; P < .001; odds ratio [OR], 12.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.917-57.922) and CYP2C9*1/*2 (26.9% vs 15.4%; P = .036; OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.090-13.190) were identified in bleeding versus control patients, whereas no differences between bleeding and controls were observed in the distribution of CYP2C9*2/*3 heterozygotes. Considering allele carriers, the presence of CYP2C9*3 allele was associated with a significant high risk of bleeding (adjusted OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 2.058-26.004).
CYP2C9 genotyping may identify subgroups of persons who potentially are at increased risk of gastroduodenal bleeding when treated with NSAIDs metabolized by CYP2C9. Further studies that evaluate the effectiveness of a strategy using CYP2C9 genotyping in NSAID users are needed before genotyping is introduced into clinical practice.
The use of doxorubicin (DOX) as a chemotherapeutic agent is limited by cardiac injury. Iloprost, a stable synthetic analogue of prostacyclin, has previously been shown to protect against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury in vitro. Here, we addressed whether iloprost is cardioprotective in vivo and whether it compromises the anti-tumour efficacy of DOX.
Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of C57BL/6 mice. DOX treatment was commenced from when tumours became visible. Iloprost was administered from prior to DOX treatment until sacrifice. Echocardiography and invasive haemodynamic measurements were performed immediately before sacrifice. As expected, DOX induced cardiac cell apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction, both of which were attenuated by iloprost. Also, iloprost alone had no effect on tumor growth and indeed, did not alter the DOX-induced suppression of this growth.
In a murine model, iloprost attenuated the acute cardiac injury and dysfunction induced by DOX therapy without compromising its chemotherapeutic effect.
Oral amiodarone effectively suppresses ventricular arrhythmias; however, full activity may take days or weeks. In patients with frequent, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, this delay is not acceptable. Thus, in these patients, the speed and dosing accuracy of an intravenous formulation would be beneficial. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of intravenous amiodarone in patients with refractory, recurrent hemodynamically destabilizing ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation by determining a dose response among three regimens.
A total of 342 patients were enrolled at 46 medical centers in the United States. Patients received one of three randomized, double-blind dose regimens delivering 125, 500, or 1000 mg during the first 24 hours. Supplemental infusions (150 mg) of intravenous amiodarone could be given to treat breakthrough ventricular arrhythmias. The key efficacy end points were the arrhythmia event rate, time to first arrhythmic event, and number of supplemental infusions administered. The event rate decreased with increasing doses: median values were 0.07, 0.04, and 0.02 events per hour for the 125-, 500-, and 1000-mg dose groups, respectively, representing a significant decrease from baseline event rates (P = .043), and approached significance in the overall test for trend (P = .067). There was a significant dose-related increase in the time to first event (trend test P = .025) and a significant dose-related decrease in the number of supplemental boluses per hour (trend test P = .043). Hypotension was the most common (26%) treatment-emergent adverse event during intravenous amiodarone therapy; there was no dose-response relationship. Seventy-eight percent of the patients survived to at least 48 hours.
Intravenous amiodarone is effective for the treatment of recurrent, life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Transient paraparesis has been reported with intrathecal chemotherapy agents and the most common cause is an incomplete inflammatory myelopathy. We report a case of a 30-year-old man diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who developed subacute anterior lumbosacral polyradiculopathy following intrathecal methotrexate, an unusual complication of intrathecal chemotherapy in adults. Spinal magnetic resonance discarded myelopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid exam showed elevation of protein, mononuclear pleocytosis and immunoglobulin synthesis. Electrodiagnostic study showed alterations of sensory and motor conductions only in lower limbs, consistent with multilevel radiculopathy. Differential diagnosis included toxic and neoplastic polyradiculopathy, and axonal variant of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. The authors review possible pathogenic mechanisms and propose several therapeutic and preventive options.
A 30-year-old man was given high doses of phenytoin together with 4 antituberculous drugs for a seizure associated with a probable brain tuberculoma. He developed hepatic toxicity and his serum phenytoin reached the high level of 298 mumol/l (therapeutic range 40-79 mumol/l). All drugs were stopped and the biological parameters returned progressively to normal over the next 15 days. However, he remained with a cerebellar axial syndrome and was still severely ataxic 2 months later. Brain CT and MRI showed mild cerebellar atrophy. This case and the few other published ones, together with some recent experimental data, show that high doses of phenytoin can be toxic to the cerebellar cortical cells. The rarity of similar cases, while millions of epileptics are under phenytoin treatment, would however suggest that individual susceptibility may play a role in this toxicity.
A 67-year-old man who had twice previously undergone operations for a tuberculum sellae meningioma was admitted to hospital for further treatment. After the third surgical intervention, the patient developed persistent low-grade fever and impaired consciousness. Computed tomography, 1 week after surgery, showed postsurgical hydrocephalus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies revealed high intracranial pressure (above 30 cm H2O), and increased cell count (1232/3). One week after the ventricular drainage, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis was recovered from his CSF, and antimicrobial susceptibility results indicated that the organism was methicillin-resistant. After 14 days of intravenous vancomycin (VCM) administration failed, linezolid (LZD) was initialized intravenously, resulting in a resolution of the meningitis. After a ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedure was performed, LZD was continued orally, which resulted in a cure. CSF penetration by VCM is reported to be poor, i.e., approximately 10% of serum concentration, which may explain its lack of efficacy. In this case, the penetration of LZD into the CSF was 58.9% of the peak value and 133% of the trough value of serum concentrations. LZD must be considered one of the first-line treatments against surgical-site infection in neurosurgery caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococci.
