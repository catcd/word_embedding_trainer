Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal disorder that may develop in the perioperative period. A case is described in which discontinuation of chronic levodopa therapy precipitated the postoperative development of this syndrome. The differential diagnosis and management principles are reviewed.
Vestibular toxicity is known to occur from gentamicin. Over a five-year period seven patients with severe and prolonged ataxia from gentamicin vestibular toxicity were seen. Two of these patients were not in renal failure. Case reports of five of these are presented. The possible explanations for prolonged disability are discussed.
To assess the preventive role of zinc chloride on toxicity of ciprofloxacin administration in Wistar albino rat litter. It was a Prospective experimental study. The study was carried out in the Department of Anatomy, Basic Medical Sciences Institute, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan during March 2002 to February 2003 one year study.
Ciprofloxacin and zinc chloride were administered to newly born albino rat litters separately and simultaneously at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight and 1200 microg/Kg body weight respectively, intraperitonealy twice daily from 1 - 14 day after birth. The animals were sacrificed by deep ether anaesthesia. The fore and hind limbs were dis-articulated from the axial skeleton, soft tissue was removed and bones were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Decalcification was done in 10% nitric acid and 10% formic acid changes. After paraplast embedding, 4 microm thick longitudinal sections of proximal & distal ends of long bones were cut by a rotary microtome. Routine staining with haemotoxylin and eosin was performed. Histomorphometery was done to measure the thickness of epiphyseal cartilage and was compared with similar values of the control animals. The results were statistically analyzed to evaluate the significance.
Our study revealed that ciprofloxacin administration in new born albino rat litter decreased the width of epiphyseal growth plate cartilage by 13.7 +/- 0.42 microm, 10.43% in humerus and 6.6 +/- 1.2 microm 4.72% in femur as compared to control, whereas, simultaneous zinc chloride administration restricted the decrease to 1.27 microm +/- SD in humerus and 2.05 microm +/- SD in femur.
Simultanous zinc chloride administration minimized the epiphseal cartilage damage induced by ciprofloxacin in Wistar albino rat litter.
We describe a woman with the 'flu' like syndrome and haemolysis whilst on a supervised daily rifampicin regimen for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Although these are known complications of rifampicin therapy, they often occur when therapy is intermittent or interrupted. Hence the case we describe is unique and is the first of its kind to be reported in Singapore.
Pancreatitis is a complex, progressively destructive inflammatory disorder. Alcohol was long thought to be the primary causative agent, but genetic contributions have been of interest since the discovery that rare PRSS1, CFTR and SPINK1 variants were associated with pancreatitis risk. We now report two associations at genome-wide significance identified and replicated at PRSS1-PRSS2 (P < 1 × 10(-12)) and X-linked CLDN2 (P < 1 × 10(-21)) through a two-stage genome-wide study (stage 1: 676 cases and 4,507 controls; stage 2: 910 cases and 4,170 controls). The PRSS1 variant likely affects disease susceptibility by altering expression of the primary trypsinogen gene. The CLDN2 risk allele is associated with atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. The homozygous (or hemizygous in males) CLDN2 genotype confers the greatest risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk. These results could partially explain the high frequency of alcohol-related pancreatitis in men (male hemizygote frequency is 0.26, whereas female homozygote frequency is 0.07).
Inorganic arsenic (iAs), a human carcinogen, potentially targets the prostate. iAs malignantly transforms the RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial line to CAsE-PE cells, and a derivative normal stem cell (SC) line, WPE-stem, to As-Cancer SC (As-CSC) line. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are noncoding but exert negative control on expression by degradation or translational repression of target mRNAs. Aberrant miRNA expression is important in carcinogenesis. A miRNA array of CAsE-PE and As-CSC revealed common altered expression in both for pathways concerning oncogenesis, miRNA biogenesis, cell signaling, proliferation, and tumor metastasis and invasion. The KRAS oncogene is overexpressed in CAsE-PE cells but not by mutation or promoter hypomethylation, and is intensely overexpressed in As-CSC cells. In both transformants, decreased miRNAs targeting KRAS and RAS superfamily members occurred. Reduced miR-134, miR-373, miR-155, miR-138, miR-205, miR-181d, miR-181c, and let-7 in CAsE-PE cells correlated with increased target RAS oncogenes, RAN, RAB27A, RAB22A mRNAs, and KRAS protein. Reduced miR-143, miR-34c-5p, and miR-205 in As-CSC correlated with increased target RAN mRNA, and KRAS, NRAS, and RRAS proteins. The RAS/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathways control cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation, and when dysregulated promote a cancer phenotype. iAs transformation increased expression of activated ERK kinase in both transformants and altered components of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway including decreased PTEN and increases in BCL2, BCL-XL, and VEGF in the absence of AKT activation. Thus, dysregulated miRNA expression may be linked to RAS activation in both transformants.
Pancreatic cancer is among the most aggressive solid malignancies. It is possible that pancreatic cancer contains cancer stem cells responsible for its malignancy. The purposes of this study were (1) to establish an assay in which a subset of pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC-1) cells with stem cell properties can propagate, and (2) to identify the cells obtained from this assay.
The PANC-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified eagle medium F12 supplemented with epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin, transferrin, selenium, and bovine serum albumin at a density of 1000 cells/mL for 10 to 14 days to form spheres. Cells of spheres were cultured in different conditions to evaluate their ability of self-renewal and differentiation. Clone formation assay and tumor formation assay were used to identify the ability of propagation in vitro and in vivo. The cells and spheres were also stained by using Hoechst 33342 dye to evaluate their capacity of excluding Hoechst dye. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect expressions of LY6E, c-Met, TACSTD1, CD34, and CD44 mRNA.
A subpopulation of PANC-1 cells could propagate to form spheres in this assay. Cells of obtained spheres had the hallmark of excluding Hoechst 33342 dye. Cultured in serum-free medium, the dissociated single cells of primary spheres could form filial spheres again; cultured in serum-containing medium, these cells generated both the cells with the ability of excluding Hoechst 33342 dye and the cells without that ability. The propagation capacity of PANC-1 spheres was higher than that of cells cultured in serum-containing medium both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, LY6E, TACSTD1, and CD44 mRNA were overexpressed in PANC-1 spheres.
A subpopulation of PANC-1 cells can propagate to form spheres with properties of stem cells in this assay; enough of these cells can be obtained for further study. Considering the overexpression of mRNA, it was tentatively suggested that LY6E, TACSTD1, and CD44 proteins may act as surface markers for sorting pancreatic cancer stem cells with fluorescence-activated cell sorter/magnetic-activated cell sorter.
Adverse drug reactions are important determinants of non-adherence to antidepressant treatment, but their assessment is complicated by overlap with depressive symptoms and lack of reliable self-report measures.
To evaluate a simple self-report measure and describe adverse reactions to antidepressants in a large sample.
The newly developed self-report Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist and the psychiatrist-rated UKU Side Effect Rating Scale were repeatedly administered to 811 adult participants with depression in a part-randomised multicentre open-label study comparing escitalopram and nortriptyline.
There was good agreement between self-report and psychiatrists' ratings. Most complaints listed as adverse reactions in people with depression were more common when they were medication-free rather than during their treatment with antidepressants. Dry mouth (74%), constipation (33%) and weight gain (15%) were associated with nortriptyline treatment. Diarrhoea (9%), insomnia (36%) and yawning (16%) were more common during treatment with escitalopram. Problems with urination and drowsiness predicted discontinuation of nortriptyline. Diarrhoea and decreased appetite predicted discontinuation of escitalopram.
Adverse reactions to antidepressants can be reliably assessed by self-report. Attention to specific adverse reactions may improve adherence to antidepressant treatment.
Ipratropium bromide, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, is widely prescribed for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Analyses of COPD patients, with underlying ischaemic heart disease, receiving anticholinergics, have indicated increased risk of severity and occurrence of cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction). The present study explored whether ipratropium bromide induces myocardial injury in nonclinical models of simulated myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Adult Sprague Dawley rat hearts/primary ventricular myocytes were exposed to simulated ischaemia/hypoxia prior to administration of ipratropium at the onset of reperfusion/reoxygenation. Infarct to risk ratio and cell viability was measured via triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The involvement of apoptosis and necrosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial-associated responses were detected by tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester fluorescence and myocyte contracture. Ipratropium (1 × 10⁻¹¹ M - 1 × 10⁻⁴ M) significantly increased infarct/risk ratio and decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Increased levels of necrosis and apoptosis were observed via flow cytometry, accompanied by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 following ipratropium treatment. Levels of endogenous myocardial acetylcholine were verified via use of an acetylcholine assay. In these experimental models, exogenous acetylcholine (1 × 10⁻⁷ M) showed protective properties, when administered alone, as well as abrogating the exacerbation of myocardial injury during ischaemia/reperfusion following ipratropium coadministration. In parallel experiments, under conditions of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion, a similar injury was observed following atropine (1 × 10⁻⁷ M) administration. These data demonstrate for the first time in a nonclinical setting that ipratropium exacerbates ischaemia/reperfusion injury via apoptotic- and necrotic-associated pathways.
Postoperative analgesia may be prolonged by the addition of clonidine to local anesthetic solutions used for regional anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial of patients undergoing podiatric surgery. The study design was prospective, double-blinded, and randomized. Ninety ASA physical status I or II patients scheduled for bunionectomy or hammer toe repair were randomized to receive ankle or metatarsal blocks with plain 1.73% lidocaine (Group L), 1.73% lidocaine with 10 micrograms/mL of clonidine added (Group C10), or 1.73% lidocaine with 20 micrograms/mL clonidine (Group C20). Time from the performance of the block to 1) loss of sensation to pinprick, 2) return of sensation to pinprick, 3) onset of postsurgical pain, and 4) time of first oral pain medication intake were recorded. Beginning at 1 h after the completion of the block, visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal pain scores were recorded every 30 min. Additional postoperative oral pain medication required in the first 9 h after the block was also recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze intergroup differences in the VAS and verbal pain scores, the time to first reported pain, the time to first oral pain medication, and the total amount of oral pain medications required. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze the VAS and verbal pain scores overall and integrated assessment of pain scores and rescue medication was per-formed. Adverse events were also recorded for each group. There were no differences among the three groups with regard to overall VAS pain scores although Group C10 had significantly better verbal pain scores after the first 3 h (P < 0.05). There was also no difference in time to loss or return of pinprick sensation. Group C10 had a longer time to first reported pain (P < 0.01), a longer time to first oral pain medication (P < 0.01), a lower average total dose of oral pain medication required (P < 0.05), and a lower integrated assessment of pain and medication (P < 0.01) than Group L. More patients in Group C10 reported no pain postoperatively (P < 0.01) and no pain medication taken (P < 0.01) than Group L. Group C20 results suggested no statistically significant improvement over plain lidocaine. One patient in Group C20 experienced significant hypotension postoperatively. pH determinations and chemical analysis by capillary electrophoresis showed no significant change in composition of the solutions when clonidine was mixed with lidocaine and stored at 4 degrees C for 1 wk. Compared to 1.73% lidocaine, combining clonidine (10 micrograms/mL) with lidocaine for local anesthetic block for foot surgery significantly increases the duration and quality of postoperative analgesia.
Menkes disease is a lethal X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disorder of copper transport caused by mutations in ATP7A, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. Early postnatal treatment with copper injections often improves clinical outcomes in affected infants. While Menkes disease newborns appear normal neurologically, analyses of fetal tissues including placenta indicate abnormal copper distribution and suggest a prenatal onset of the metal transport defect. In an affected fetus whose parents found termination unacceptable and who understood the associated risks, we began in utero copper histidine treatment at 31.5 weeks gestational age. Copper histidine (900 μg per dose) was administered directly to the fetus by intramuscular injection (fetal quadriceps or gluteus) under ultrasound guidance. Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling enabled serial measurement of fetal copper and ceruloplasmin levels that were used to guide therapy over a four-week period. Fetal copper levels rose from 17 μg/dL prior to treatment to 45 μg/dL, and ceruloplasmin levels from 39 mg/L to 122 mg/L. After pulmonary maturity was confirmed biochemically, the baby was delivered at 35.5 weeks and daily copper histidine therapy (250 μg sc b.i.d.) was begun. Despite this very early intervention with copper, the infant showed hypotonia, developmental delay, and electroencephalographic abnormalities and died of respiratory failure at 5.5 months of age. The patient's ATP7A mutation (Q724H), which severely disrupted mRNA splicing, resulted in complete absence of ATP7A protein on Western blots. These investigations suggest that prenatally initiated copper replacement is inadequate to correct Menkes disease caused by severe loss-of-function mutations, and that postnatal ATP7A gene addition represents a rational approach in such circumstances.
Methods to correct the QT interval for heart rate are often in disagreement and may be further confounded by changes in autonomic state. This can be problematic when trying to distinguish the changes in QT interval by either drug-induced delayed repolarization or from autonomic-mediated physiological responses. Assessment of the canine dynamic QT-RR interval relationship was visualized by novel programming of the dynamic beat-to-beat confluence of data or "clouds". To represent the nonuniformity of the clouds, a bootstrap sampling method that computes the mathematical center of the uncorrected beat-to-beat QT value (QTbtb) with upper 95% confidence bounds was adopted and compared with corrected QT (QTc) using standard correction factors. Nitroprusside-induced reflex tachycardia reduced QTbtb by 43 ms, whereas an increase of 55 and 16 ms was obtained using the Bazett (QTcB) and Fridericia (QTcF) formulae, respectively. Phenylephrine-induced reflex bradycardia increased QTbtb by 3 ms but decreased QTcB by 20 ms and QTcF by 12 ms. Delayed repolarization with E-4031 (1-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)ethyl]-4-methylsulfonylaminobenzoyl)-piperidine), an inhibitor of rectifier potassium current, increased QTbtb by 26 ms but QT prolongation calculations using QTcF and QTcB were between 12 and 52% less, respectively, when small decreases in heart rate (5-8 beats per minute) were apparent. Dynamic assessment of beat-to-beat data, using the bootstrap method, allows quantification of QT interval changes under varying conditions of heart rate, autonomic tone, and direct repolarization that may not be distinguishable with use of standard correction factors.
Weekly paclitaxel and infusional high-dose 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (HDFL) are both effective regimens for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.
A study was designed using weekly paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) 1-hour infusion followed by 2,000 mg/m(2) 5-fluorouracil plus 300 mg/m(2) leucovorin 24-hour infusion on days 1, 8 and 15, repeated every 28 days, in patients who had previously received a > or =1 regimen for MBC. The dose of paclitaxel was adjusted in each cycle according to toxicity.
A total of 182 cycles were given to 28 patients. The doses of paclitaxel needed to be reduced only in 22 (12%) cycles. Forty-five cycles were skipped or delayed more than 7 days, mostly due to neutropenia, infection, or neurotoxicity. Twenty-five patients were evaluable for response. Four had complete response, 13 partial response, seven stable disease, and two progressive disease. The response rate was 60.7% (95% CI: 42.6-78.8). Median survival was 18.1 months (95% CI: 11.4-24.9), and progression-free survival seven months.
Weekly paclitaxel plus infusional HDFL is an active and well tolerated regimen for pretreated MBC patients.
Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 and expression of the D4Z4-encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. The more common form, autosomal dominant FSHD1, is caused by contraction of the D4Z4 array, whereas the genetic determinants and inheritance of D4Z4 array contraction-independent FSHD2 are unclear. Here, we show that mutations in SMCHD1 (encoding structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1) on chromosome 18 reduce SMCHD1 protein levels and segregate with genome-wide D4Z4 CpG hypomethylation in human kindreds. FSHD2 occurs in individuals who inherited both the SMCHD1 mutation and a normal-sized D4Z4 array on a chromosome 4 haplotype permissive for DUX4 expression. Reducing SMCHD1 levels in skeletal muscle results in D4Z4 contraction-independent DUX4 expression. Our study identifies SMCHD1 as an epigenetic modifier of the D4Z4 metastable epiallele and as a causal genetic determinant of FSHD2 and possibly other human diseases subject to epigenetic regulation.
The purpose of this study was to estimate the importance of mutations in the connexin50 gene (GJA8) as a cause of congenital or developmental cataracts in the Indian population and to identify novel mutations in GJA8 that cause cataract in this population.
The coding region of GJA8 was analyzed for mutation by single strand conformational polymorphism in 60 probands affected with congenital or developmental cataract of which 11 probands' corneal diameter measured less than 11.00 mm. Direct sequencing was performed for samples that displayed an abnormal electrophoresis pattern. The segregation of the change with the diseased phenotype was analyzed in the entire pedigree by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.
Molecular analysis of GJA8 revealed two novel missense mutations V44E and R198Q, in the population screened. The mutations cosegregated with the diseased phenotype in an autosomal dominant manner and were absent in 400 normal control chromosomes analyzed. GJA8 mutations were seen in two of the 60 unrelated probands with cataracts. Affected individuals in both of whose families also had microcornea and variable myopia.
This is the first report of mutations in GJA8 to be associated with autosomal dominant cataract and microcornea. Mutations in GJA8 cause 3.3% of congenital cataracts in the population of India.
The efficacy of i.v. versus s.c. administration of Glucantime (100 mg/kg of body weight/day) was studied in 41 dogs with leishmaniasis without serious renal insufficiency. Remission was obtained in 35 dogs (85.4%) after 3 to 6 weeks of treatment but there was a relapse within 1 year in 26 dogs (74.3%). The median period of remission was 6 months. Cross-over therapy resulted in remission in 17 of 20 dogs. The percentage of remission after initial and cross-over therapy, the median relapse free period, and survival did not differ significantly between the two groups. There were very few complications and most were of minor clinical importance. Thrombophlebitis developed in one dog after i.v. injection. In dogs with leishmaniasis without serious renal insufficiency, there is a 75% probability of survival for more than 4 years following treatment with Glucantime for 3 to 6 weeks, with additional treatment when relapses occur.
Isoproterenol-headup tilt table testing provides a diagnosis of neuromediated syncope in many patients who faint. The involvement of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the provocation of syncope suggests that beta blockers might chronically prevent syncope. To assess this, a cohort of 153 syncope patients (age 39 +/- 20 years) underwent baseline assessment of demographic variables, symptomatic burden, and hemodynamic and clinical responses to tilt testing. Fifty-two patients then received beta blockers, and 101 did not receive drug therapy. The primary outcome was the time to the first recurrent syncopal spell. Actuarial survival analysis was used. Syncope recurred in 17 of 52 patients who received beta blockers and in 28 of 101 patients who were untreated. The actuarial probability of remaining free of syncope was similar in both groups. For example, the probability of remaining free of syncope 12 months following the tilt test was 0.72 in both populations. Thus, treatment with beta blockers may not have a significant effect in preventing syncope recurrence following a positive tilt test.
The purpose of this study was to measure serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT) with a commercially available human enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test in various groups of dogs, including those undergoing doxorubicin chemotherapy. Serum samples were obtained from 6 groups of dogs: (1) normal adult dogs (n = 15); (2) dogs with asymptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 5); (3) dogs with congestive heart failure (n = 10); (4) dogs with untreated neoplasia (n = 20); (5) dogs with skeletal muscle trauma (n = 10); and (6) dogs with neoplasia receiving doxorubicin chemotherapy (n = 4). One serum sample was obtained from each of the normal dogs, those with asymptomatic cardiomyopathy, those with congestive heart failure, and those with untreated neoplasia. Serum samples were obtained serially from the dogs that were undergoing doxorubicin chemotherapy; samples were collected before doxorubicin (30 mg/m2) administration and then 1, 5, 7, and 14 days after administration throughout 6 cycles for a cumulative total dose of 180 mg/m2. All normal dogs, dogs with untreated neoplasia, and dogs with asymptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy had cTnT concentrations below the lower limits of detection for the assay used (<0.05 ng/mL). Detectable concentrations of cTnT were found in 3 dogs with congestive heart failure and in 2 dogs with skeletal muscle trauma. Detectable concentrations also were found in both dogs that had received 180 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. We conclude that dogs with congestive heart failure and those with skeletal muscle trauma and dogs with neoplasia receiving high-dose doxorubicin chemotherapy may have increased serum cTnT concentration, which may be suggestive of myocardial damage.
We investigated the interrelated antihypotensive effects of static magnetic fields (SMF) and plasma catecholamine levels in reserpine-induced hypotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Seven-week-old male rats were exposed to two different ranges of SMF intensities, 3.0-10 mT (Bmax) or 7.5-25 mT (Bmax) for 12 weeks. Six experimental groups of 10 animals each were examined: (1) no exposure with intraperitoneal (ip) saline injection (sham exposed control); (2) 10 mT SMF exposure with ip saline injection (10 mT); (3) 25 mT SMF exposure with ip saline injection (25 mT); (4) no exposure with ip reserpine injection (RES); (5) 10 mT SMF exposure with ip reserpine injection (10 mT + RES); (6) 25 mT SMF exposure with ip reserpine injection (25 mT + RES). Reserpine (5 mg/kg) was administered three times a week for 12 weeks, and 18 h after each injection, arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate, skin blood flow, plasma nitric oxide metabolites, plasma catecholamine levels, and behavioral parameters of a functional observational battery (FOB) were monitored. The action of reserpine significantly decreased BP, reduced plasma norepinephrine (NE), increased the FOB hunched posture score and decreased the number of rearing events in the RES group, compared with the respective age-matched control group. Exposure to 25 mT, but not 10 mT, for 2-12 weeks significantly prevented the reserpine-induced decrease of BP in the 25 mT + RES group compared with the respective RES group. Moreover, exposure to 25 mT for 5 weeks partially suppressed the reserpine-induced NE reduction, but did not bring about a complete reversal of reserpine effects. NE levels for the 25 mT + RES group for 5 weeks were significantly higher compared with the RES group, but still lower compared with the control group. In addition, the FOB hunched posture score for the 25 mT + RES group was significantly lower and the number of rearing events was higher compared with the RES group, but these behavioral parameters did not revert to control levels. There were no significant differences in any of the physiological or behavioral parameters measured between the 10 mT + RES and RES groups, nor between the two different SMF groups and the control group. These results indicate that 25 mT SMF with spatial gradients significantly suppressed the reserpine-induced hypotension and bradykinesia. The antihypotensive effects of SMF on the reserpine-treated group might be at least partially related to the inhibition of NE depletion.
Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) and the elastotic changes of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) are rare but well-recognized side-effects of long-term penicillamine therapy. A 42-year old female patient who developed both of these cutaneous side-effects following treatment with high-dose penicillamine for Wilson's disease is described; near-complete resolution of the EPS, but not the PXE was achieved by treatment with isotretinoin (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks, despite continuation of the penicillamine.
Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant, but also has an anti-manic effect, and recently it has been increasingly used in combination with neuroleptics. Nevertheless, there have been very few reports on the involvement of carbamazepine in the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
A case of NMS occurring after addition of carbamazepine to long-term neuroleptic administration is described.
The patient had been treated with neuroleptics for about 30 years, and NMS developed when carbamazepine (400 mg/day) was added.
This case suggests that clinicians should consider the risk of NMS when carbamazepine is administered to patients undergoing long-term treatment with neuroleptics.
Inbred male WF rats were castrated at 40 days of age and divided into 5 groups. Group I was given no further treatment. Groups III, IV, and V received pellet implants of 5.0 mg diethylstilbestrol (DES) concurrently with castration. At 50-55 days of age, groups II, IV, and V were given drinking water containing 5.0 mg N-nitrosobutylurea (NBU) per day for 30 days (subthreshold dose). At the termination of NBU treatment, group V further received daily sc injections of 2-bromoergocryptine (CB-154; 0.4 mg/100 g body wt) four times a week throughout the experiment. None of castrated rats or rats castrated and treated with NBU alone developed hepatic tumors (HT) and pituitary tumors (PT). Incidences of HT and PT in groups III, IV, and V were 4/9 (44%) and 7/9 (78%), 15/17 (88%) and 12/17 (71%), and 17/20 (85%) and 4/20 (20%), respectively. The treatment of DES alone resulted in the concurrent development of HT and PT in castrated male rats (group III), and further NBU treatment significantly increased the incidence of HT (group IV). CB-154 treatment did not change the incidence of HT, the number of HT per rat, and the liver weight, although it significantly reduced the incidence of PT, the pituitary weight, and the serum prolactin level in castrated male rats given DES and NBU (group V). These results indicate that DES itself had a direct carcinogenic effect on the liver; this effect was not mediated by prolactin, and NBU increased the effect of DES in this process.
1. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of the nitric oxide (NO) system in cortisol-induced hypertension in humans. 2. Plasma and urinary nitrate/nitrite concentrations and plasma concentrations of arginine and symmetric (SDMA) and asymmetric (ADMA) dimethyl arginine were measured in six subjects on a restricted nitrate diet who were treated with 80 mg/day cortisol and in subjects on an unrestricted nitrate diet who were treated with cortisol (80 mg/day, n = 6, or 200 mg/day, n = 10) for 5 days. 3. Cortisol significantly increased systolic and mean arterial pressure. Significant reductions in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations were observed in subjects on a restricted nitrate diet on days 3, 4 and 5 of cortisol treatment (to 11 +/- 1, 10 +/- 1, 11 +/- 1 pmol/L, respectively) compared with pretreatment (16 +/- 1 pmol/L; P < 0.01). There were no significant changes in plasma arginine, ADMA or SDMA concentrations. 4. Cortisol treatment significantly increased blood pressure and reduced plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations. Reductions in plasma nitrate concentrations are not explained by changes in substrate availability or in endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. These data support a role for the NO system in cortisol-induced hypertension in humans.
Pyrrolotetrazinones are a new class of azolotetrazinones endowed with a high, remarkable antiproliferative activity in human tumor cultured cells. They hold the deaza skeleton of the antitumor drug temozolomide, although preliminary investigations indicated a different mechanism of action. To understand their mechanism(s) of action along with their target at molecular level, four derivatives were selected on the basis of their activity on a panel of human tumor cell lines and they were investigated in depth in a T leukemia cell line (Jurkat).
Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle after treatment with pyrrolotetrazinones has demonstrated that they were able to induce an arrest of the cell cycle in G2/M phase. This effect was accompanied by apoptosis of the treated cells which is further characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine on the external surface of the cell membranes. Mitochondria were strongly involved in the apoptotic pathway as demonstrated by the induced mitochondrial depolarization, generation of reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-3. Western blot analysis showed that Bcl-2 expression was down regulated whereas the proapototic protein Bax was upregulated in a time dependent manner. Moreover, these compounds induced a clear increase in the mitotic index, and inhibited microtubule assembly in vitro indicating that pyrrolotetrazinones, at variance with temozolomide, involved an efficacious inhibition of tubulin polymerization in their mechanism of action. Interestingly compound 3 at the concentration of 50 mg/kg body weight significantly inhibited in vivo the growth of a syngeneic hepatocellular carcinoma in Balb/c mice.
These results suggest that pyrrolotetrazinones inhibit microtubule polymerization, induce G2/M arrest of cell cycle and cause apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway identifying them as novel effective antimitotic agents with potential for clinical development.
We previously reported that 14-day exposure to 7-chlorinated benz[a]anthracene (7-Cl-BaA), a new environmental pollutant, selectively induced hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2 in rats, although treatment with its parent, benz[a]anthracene (BaA), induced CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1. In this study, to better understand the relative contribution of chlorination to the toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), we investigated the organ-specific distributions of 7-Cl-BaA and BaA in F334 rats. After 14 days of oral administration of 7-Cl-BaA or BaA at a concentration of 1 or 10 mg/kg body weight/day, both chemicals were detected in their plasma, which was collected 24 hr after the last administration, even at the lower dosage. Dose-dependent accumulation patterns were observed in the liver, muscle, kidney, spleen, heart, and lung. The 7-Cl-BaA concentrations in the organs were higher than those of the BaA. Furthermore, at the end of the exposure, 7-Cl-BaA specifically regulated several CYP genes in the heart more so than in other organs, although these inductions were not significant in the BaA treatment. 7-Cl-BaA might also stimulate the metabolic pathways of chemicals other than AhR-mediated metabolism, which is specific to normal PAHs, because of the alterations of CYP2J4, CYP4B1, and CYP17A1 expression in rats. In conclusion, our results imply that the chlorination of PAHs may change their organ-specific distribution and consequently alter their toxicological impacts compared to their parent PAHs.
