Activated microglia have been associated with neurodegeneration in patients and in animal models of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), however their precise functions as neurotoxic or neuroprotective is a topic of significant investigation. To explore this, we examined the effects of pilocarpine-induced seizures in transgenic mice where microglia/macrophages were conditionally ablated. We found that unilateral ablation of microglia from the dorsal hippocampus did not alter acute seizure sensitivity. However, when this procedure was coupled with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning (1 mg/kg given 24 h prior to acute seizure), we observed a significant pro-convulsant phenomenon. This effect was associated with lower metabolic activation in the ipsilateral hippocampus during acute seizures, and could be attributed to activity in the mossy fiber pathway. These findings reveal that preconditioning with LPS 24 h prior to seizure induction may have a protective effect which is abolished by unilateral hippocampal microglia/macrophage ablation.
Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the amnestic effects of orally administered lorazepam. The subjects were tested for immediate and delayed recall, using a word recall memory task. The subjects taking lorazepam did not differ from subjects receiving placebo on immediate recall. However, the delayed recall scores of lorazepam subjects were significantly lower compared to the placebo group (p less than .01).
With the aim of developing a medium-term assay for screening of environmental carcinogens, we exposed mammary carcinogen sensitive human c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene transgenic (Hras128) rats to various carcinogens, including compounds that do not normally induce mammary tumors. Seven-week-old Hras128 rats and wild-type littermates received administrations of 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), anthracene, pyrene, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), diethylnitrosamine (DEN) or azoxymethane (AOM) and were sacrificed at week 12 (females) (at week 10 for the 3-MC group) or week 20 (males). Female Hras128 rats receiving NNK, DEN, or DMA showed a significant increase in mammary tumor incidence and/or multiplicity compared to the respective values with olive oil or deionized distilled water (DDW) vehicles. In male Hras128 rats, a significant increase in mammary tumors was also observed in groups administered 3-MC, B[a]P, anthracene, IQ, and NNK. Mutations of transgenes were observed in codons 12 and/or 61 in the induced tumors by PCR-RFLP except in the DEN group in female and in the MeIQx group in male Hras128 rats. Thus various carcinogens, not necessarily limited to those normally targeting the breast, were found to induce mammary carcinomas in Hras128 rats, especially in females, pointing to potential use for medium-term screening.
To determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade (CAB)-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement.
Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [26 with stage C (T3N0M0) and 16 with stage D1 (T3N1M0)] were included in this study. All patients received CAB [leuprolide acetate (LHRH-A) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB). Hb, PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded. Patients with stage D2-3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study. The duration of the study was six months.
The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14.2 g/dl to 14.0 g/dl, 13.5 g/dl, 13.2 g/dl and 12.7 g/dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB, respectively. Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g/dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients (14.3%). This CAB-induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic. At six months post-CAB, patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10.2 +/- 0.1 g/dl (X +/- SE), whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13.2 +/- 0.17 (X +/- SE). The development of severe anemia at 6 months post-CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2.5 g/dl after 3 months of CAB (p = 0.01). The development of severe CAB-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values (T < 3 ng/ml versus T > or = 3 ng/ml), with age (< 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage (stage C versus stage D1). Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections (3 times/week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO-beta).
Our data suggest that rHuEPO-beta correctable CAB-induced anemia occurs in 14.3% of prostate cancer patients after 6 months of therapy.
Depression is a common problem in elderly patients and frequently is treated with antidepressants. We present the case of a 67-year-old depressed woman who began treatment with citalopram. Two months later, hyponatremia was diagnosed, most likely syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. After discontinuation of citalopram therapy, serum sodium concentrations normalized. Later, she began treatment with mirtazapine. Five months after initiating mirtazapine therapy, she developed symptomatic hyponatremia. After mirtazapine therapy was discontinued, serum sodium concentrations normalized. In this case, unlike those previously reported, hyponatremia recurred 5 months after switching from citalopram to mirtazapine, which is believed to be a safe antidepressant. In conclusion, patients older than 60 years should have baseline electrolyte measurements before starting therapy with an antidepressant, and these should be monitored not only in the first weeks of treatment, but throughout the full course.
We report a case of coronary artery spasm induced by 5-fluorouracil. The symptoms occurred during continuous intravenous infusion of the drug, and a coronary spasm was visualized at angiography.
To investigate the killing effects of cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine (CD/5-FC) suicide gene therapy system on human malignant glioma cells in vitro.
The pCMVCD plasmid was transfected into the U251 human malignant glioma cells using Lipofectamine 2000-mediated method. Resistant clones (named U251/CD cells) were isolated by screening with G418 presence. U251/CD cells were incubated with 5-FC in different concentrations to determine the number of viability cells (or cytotoxicity assay), and measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the media were measured by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.
The untreated U251 cells were insensitive to 5-FC, with the IC50 about 6 500 micromol/L. After the transfection, the IC50 was dramatically reduced to about 10 micromol/L. Therefore, gene transfection made G418-resistant clones (U251/CD cells) highly sensitive to 5-FC. HPLC analysis showed that 5-FU was detected in U251/CD cell medium.
The killing effects of U251 cells modified by CD gene were induced by 5-FC, and the CD/5-FC system was feasible to treat glioma.
Due to the increased utilization of this test for the evaluation of chest pain and for prognostic stratification in patients with a recent myocardial infarction, the results of 235 consecutive tests have been analyzed to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of side effects induced by dobutamine. A potential limitation to the clinical utilization of dobutamine stress echocardiography is the higher incidence of side effects comparison with to other non invasive tests for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease reported by some authors.
Dobutamine/atropine stress echocardiography was performed in 256 patients affected by acute myocardial infarction. Dobutamine was infused starting with the dose of 5 micrograms/kg/min over 3 minutes with incremental steps of 10-20-30-40 micrograms/kg/min over 3 minutes and atropine, in cases of poor chronotropic response, under 2D-echocardiographic and 12-lead electrocardiographic monitoring.
The test was interrupted only in 4 cases for atrial fibrillation (2 patients) and symptomatic hypotension. Patients were divided according to the absence (G1) or presence (G2) of cardiac arrhythmias during the test. Patients of G2 differred from patients of G1 only in respect of the maximal dose of dobutamine infused and the incidence of a wall motion abnormality in the basal echocardiogram.
Dobutamine/atropine echo stress test may be considered a safe test for the evaluation of the presence and severity of coronary artery disease in patients with a previous or recent myocardial infarction.
In premature infants, glucocorticoids ameliorate chronic lung disease, but have adverse effects on growth and the cardiovascular system. Glucocorticoid excess promotes free radical overproduction and vascular dysfunction.
We hypothesized that the adverse effects of postnatal glucocorticoid therapy are secondary to oxidative stress and that antioxidant treatment would diminish unwanted effects.
Male rat pups received a clinically relevant course of dexamethasone (Dex), or Dex with vitamins C and E (DexCE), on postnatal days 1-6 (P1-6). Controls received saline (Ctrl) or saline with vitamins (CtrlCE).
At P21, Dex reduced survival (Ctrl: 96 vs. Dex: 70%) and promoted asymmetric growth restriction (ponderal index, Ctrl: 6.3 +/- 0.1 g . mm(-3) x 10(-5) vs. Dex: 7.4 +/- 0.2 g . mm(-3) x 10(-5)), both p < 0.05. Dex increased cardiac oxidative stress (protein expression: 4-HNE +20%, Hsp90 -42% and eNOS -54%), induced left ventricle (LV) wall thinning (LV wall volume: Ctrl: 47.2 +/- 1.2 mm(3) vs. Dex: 38.9 +/- 1.7 mm(3)) and decreased the ratio of the aortic lumen:total vessel area (Ctrl: 0.74 +/- 0.01 vs. Dex: 0.66 +/- 0.02), all p < 0.05. DexCE restored towards control values survival, growth symmetry the aortic lumen:total vessel area, and increased the cardiac expression of Hsp90 relative to Dex. In addition, relative to controls, the decrease in the cardiac expression of eNOS was no longer significant in DexCE animals (-20.3 +/- 14.4%, p > 0.05). However, DexCE did not prevent growth retardation, cardiac 4-HNE upregulation (DexCE: +29%) or LV thinning (DexCE: 40.1 +/- 1.1 mm(3)). Treatment of neonates with vitamins alone affected somatic growth and promoted thinner LV walls (CtrlCE: 39.9 +/- 0.5 mm(3), p < 0.05).
Combined glucocorticoid and antioxidant therapy in premature infants may be safer than glucocorticoids alone in the treatment of chronic lung disease. However, antioxidant therapy in healthy offspring is not recommended.
l-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (l-2-HGA) is characterized by progressive deterioration of central nervous system function including epilepsy and macrocephaly in 50% of cases, and elevated levels of l-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging shows distinct abnormalities. We report the identification of a gene for l-2-HGA aciduria (MIM 236792) using homozygosity mapping. Nine homozygous mutations including three missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, two splice site mutations and two deletions were identified in the gene C14orf160, localized on chromosome 14q22.1, in 21 patients from one non-consanguineous and 14 consanguineous Turkish families. We propose to name the gene duranin. Duranin encodes a putative mitochondrial protein with homology to FAD-dependent oxidoreductases. The functional role of this enzyme in intermediary metabolism in humans remains to be established.
Dehydroeburicoic acid (DeEA) is a triterpene purified from medicinal fungi such as Antrodia camphorate, the crude extract of which is known to exert cytotoxic effects against several types of cancer cells. We aim to test the hypothesis that DeEA possesses significant cytotoxic effects against glioblastomas, one of the most frequent and malignant brain tumors in adults. 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase release assays indicated that DeEA inhibited the proliferation of the human glioblastoma cell U87MG. In addition, Annexin V and propidium iodide staining showed that DeEA treatment led to a rapid increase of glioblastomas in the necrotic/late apoptotic fraction, whereas cell cycle analysis revealed that DeEA failed to significantly enhance the population of U87MG cells in the hypodiploid (sub-G1) fraction. Using electron microscopy, we found that DeEA induced significant cell enlargements, massive cytoplasmic vacuolization, and loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity. DeEA treatment triggered an intracellular Ca(2+) increase, and DeEA-induced cell death was significantly attenuated by BAPTA-AM but not ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid. DeEA instigated a reduction of both mitochondrial transmembrane potential and intracellular ATP level. Moreover, DeEA induced proteolysis of alpha-spectrin by calpain, and DeEA cytotoxicity in U87MG cells was caspase-independent but was effectively blocked by calpain inhibitor. Interestingly, DeEA also caused autophagic response that was prevented by calpain inhibitor. Taken together, these results suggest that in human glioblastomas, DeEA induces necrotic cell death that involves Ca(2+) overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, and calpain activation.
Nanoparticles can reach the blood and cause inflammation, suggesting that nanoparticles-endothelial cells interactions may be pathogenically relevant. We evaluated the effect of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO₂) on proliferation, death, and responses related with inflammatory processes such as monocytic adhesion and expression of adhesion molecules (E- and P-selectins, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and PECAM-1) and with inflammatory molecules (tissue factor, angiotensin-II, VEGF, and oxidized LDL receptor-1) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We also evaluated the production of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production, and NF-κB pathway activation. Aggregates of TiO₂ of 300 nm or smaller and individual nanoparticles internalized into HUVEC inhibited proliferation strongly and induced apoptotic and necrotic death starting at 5 μg/cm². Besides, TiO₂ induced activation of HUVEC through an increase in adhesion and in expression of adhesion molecules and other molecules involved with the inflammatory process. These effects were associated with oxidative stress and NF-κB pathway activation. In conclusion, TiO₂ induced HUVEC activation, inhibition of cell proliferation with increased cell death, and oxidative stress.
Bisphenol A (BPA), a suspected reproductive biohazard and endocrine disruptor, released from plastics is associated with ED in occupationally exposed workers. However, in rats, despite the induction of hypogonadism, apoptosis of the penile corporal smooth muscle (SM), fat infiltration into the cavernosal tissue and changes in global gene expression with the intraperitoneal administration of high dose BPA, ED was not observed. We investigated whether BPA administered orally rather than intraperitoneally to rats for longer periods and lower doses will lead to ED. Main outcome measures are ED, histological, and biochemical markers in rat penile tissues. In all, 2.5-month-old rats were given drinking water daily without and with BPA at 1 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) per day. Two months later, erectile function was determined by cavernosometry and electrical field stimulation (EFS) and serum levels of testosterone (T), estradiol (E2) and BPA were measured. Penile tissue sections were assayed by Masson (SM/collagen), Oil Red O (fat), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) (apoptosis), immunohistochemistry for Oct4 (stem cells), and α-SM actin/calponin (SM and myofibroblasts), applying quantitative image analysis. Other markers were assayed by western blotting. DNA microarrays/microRNA (miR) assays defined transcription profiles. Orally administered BPA did not affect body weight, but (1) decreased serum T and E2; (2) reduced the EFS response and increased the drop rate; (3) increased within the corporal tissue the presence of fat, myofibroblasts and apoptosis; (4) lowered the contents of SM and stem cells, but not nerve terminals; and (5) caused alterations in the transcriptional profiles for both mRNA and miRs within the penile shaft. Long-term exposure of rats to oral BPA caused a moderate corporal veno-occlusive dysfunction (CVOD), possibly due to alterations within the corporal tissue that pose gene transcriptional changes related to inflammation, fibrosis and epithelial/mesenchymal transition (EMT).
To Investigate the frequency of valvular heart disease in patients taking pergolide.
The medical records of patients seen at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla, between 1998 and 2003 were searched electronically for the word pergolide and the presence of a 2-dimensional echocardiogram. Patients who had not taken pergolide before undergoing echocardlography served as the control group. Echocardiograms were reviewed for the presence of valvular regurgitation. The frequency of valvular disease in patients taking pergolide was calculated and compared with controls. Associations with dosage and years of treatment also were examined.
Fifty-five patients made up the pergolide group, and 63 served as controls. When looking at aortic regurgitation (AR) of any degree, 45% of patients in the pergolide group had AR, compared with 21% of controls (P = .006). The frequency of moderate to severe valvular regurgitation in the pergolide group was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-22%), 13% (95% CI, 5%-24%), and 13% (95% CI, 5%-24%) for the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves, respectively. No statistical difference was identified in the frequency of moderate to severe valvular regurgitation (mitral, tricuspid, or aortic) when compared with controls. There was marginal evidence of an association between a higher daily dosage of pergolide and moderate to severe AR (P = .05).
The frequency of AR appears to be Increased in patients taking pergolide. Our study suggests that if a cause-effect relationship exists between pergolide and valvular heart disease, it likely occurs at a low but clinically important Incidence and may be associated with dosage.
The chronic (10 mg/kg i.p. twice daily, 10 days)-and not the acute-administration of amitriptyline, maprotiline or zimelidine enhances aggressiveness induced by clonidine in mice. An analogous potentiation of clonidine-induced aggressiveness was obtained with chronic administration (the schedule as above) of levomepromazine (2 mg/kg) or thioridazine (5 mg/kg) but not of spiperone (0.2 mg/kg). Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), atropine (5 mg/kg), propranolol (10 mg/kg) or metergoline (0.5 mg/kg) given chronically (the schedule as above) also had no effect. The enhancement of clonidine aggressiveness induced by prolonged treatment with imipramine (10 mg/kg) was prevented by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The results supply further evidence for the previously proposed hypothesis that chronic administration of antidepressants enhances the responsiveness of central postsynaptic noradrenaline receptors.
After preoperative intubation and administration of intravenous cefuroxime, a 48-year-old white female developed anaphylactic shock that was refractory to the usual therapeutic measures but was responsive to treatment with intravenous cimetidine. Beta-lactam sensitivity was subsequently confirmed by skin testing. Cimetidine, which antagonizes arterial H2 receptors, may be useful in the treatment of anaphylaxis refractory to the usual resuscitative measures.
A multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled trial among women with singleton pregnancies and a history of spontaneous preterm birth found that weekly injections of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P), initiated between 16 and 20 weeks of gestation, reduced preterm birth by 33%. The current study estimated both preterm birth recurrence and the potential reduction in the national preterm birth rate.
Using 2002 national birth certificate data, augmented by vital statistics from 2 states, we estimated the number of singleton births delivered to women eligible for 17P through both a history of spontaneous preterm birth and prenatal care onset within the first 4 months of pregnancy. The number and rate of recurrent spontaneous preterm births were estimated. To predict effect, the reported 33% reduction in spontaneous preterm birth attributed to 17P therapy was applied to these estimates.
In 2002, approximately 30,000 recurrent preterm births occurred to women eligible for 17P, having had a recurrent preterm birth rate of 22.5%. If 17P therapy were delivered to these women, nearly 10,000 spontaneous preterm births would have been prevented, thereby reducing the overall United States preterm birth rate by approximately 2%, from 12.1% to 11.8% (P < .001), with higher reductions in targeted groups of eligible pregnant women.
Use of 17P could reduce preterm birth among eligible women, but would likely have a modest effect on the national preterm birth rate. Additional research is urgently needed to identify other populations who might benefit from 17P, evaluate new methods for early detection of women at risk, and develop additional prevention strategies.

1. Tritium labelled proteins, namely bovine serum albumin ([3H]BSA), rat serum albumin ([3H]RSA), anionic horseradish peroxidase ([3H]aHRP) and immunoglobulin present in urine fractions from rat filtration studies in vivo and isolated perfused rat kidneys (IPKs) have been shown by gel chromatographic analysis to be severely degraded to small peptides. The degradation of RSA and BSA in vivo has been shown to be similar. 2. Degradation of proteins in the urine from IPK experiments was inhibited by including 150 mmol/l lysine in the perfusate. Similarly, [3H]BSA and [3H]aHRP excreted from rats with puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was again essentially intact for both IPK and in vivo experiments. 3. It appears that the degradation of proteins observed in urine obtained from control kidneys is due, in part, to proteolytic activity associated with the proximal tubule. Inhibition of proximal tubule function, which occurs for both lysine and puromycin aminonucleoside treatments (as calibrated by lysozyme uptake), results in inhibition of the degradation observed. Glomerular epithelial cells could also contribute to the degradation. 4. There was no generation of low-molecular-weight material in the perfusate or plasma arising from breakdown of circulating proteins or recycling of potential degradation products from the tubules.
This report presents a male who developed clonic seizures on the day he was born. The next day, the diagnosis of pyridoxine-dependent seizures was made. However, contradictory to this diagnosis, seizures reappeared despite treatment with pyridoxine. Seizures ceased after folinic acid was initiated. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of folinic acid-responsive seizures are reviewed. Treatment with folinic acid should be considered in neonatal seizures of unknown origin that do not respond to pyridoxine, or manifest a transient response to pyridoxine.
Therapeutic doses of phenothiazines increased serum levels of prolactin, resulting in a number of side effects. Bromocriptine, a potent dopamine agonist, appears to effectively reduce the serum prolactin level. In this open pilot study, bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel, Sandoz) was administered in an escalating dose schedule to 11 stabilized psychiatric outpatients with hyperprolactinemia resulting from thioridazine HCl (Mellaril, Sandoz) treatment. 6 of 9 patients showed decreases. Overall global psychiatric evaluations were unchanged over the course of combined therapy for all but 1 patient, who showed improvement. The trend of decreased prolactin serum levels indicates that bromocriptine mesylate may prove a useful adjunct to reduce the side effects of hyperprolactinemia.
In the present study, the influence of withdrawal from repeated administration of morphine on intra-ventral hippocampal microinjection of histamine-induced anxiety-like behavior was investigated in male Wistar rats. Three days subcutaneous administration of morphine (5-10 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug decreased the percentage open arm time and the percentage open arm entries. Intra-ventral hippocampal administration of histamine (2.5-7.5 microg/rat) decreased percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries. Intra-ventral hippocampal histamine-induced anxiogenic effect was reversed in animals that had previously received the three days morphine (7.5 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug. Intra-ventral hippocampal administration of pyrilamine (5-20 microg/rat) or ranitidine (10-40 microg/rat) decreased percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries. Pyrilamine- or ranitidine-induced anxiogenic effect was not changed in animals that had previously received the three days morphine (7.5 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug. Intra-ventral hippocampal injections of clobenpropit increased percentage open arm time. The percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries were decreased in the morphine-treated animals compared with non-morphine-treated controls. Percentage open arm entries and locomotor activity was reduced with some doses of clobenpropit. It can be concluded that the histamine system is involved in anxiety-like behavior, and repeated injections of morphine followed by five days free of the drugs interact with histamine receptor mechanism.
The persistent effects on blood pressure of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan and the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril were compared in the young spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Losartan (DuP753/MK954, 15 mg/kg/day) and captopril (100 mg/kg/day) were given in the drinking water of 3-week-old SHRs for 4- and 10-week durations. Blood pressure was measured during treatment and after treatment was stopped until the age of 30 weeks. Both losartan and captopril given for 4 and 10 weeks prevented the development of hypertension during treatment and redevelopment of hypertension after treatment was stopped. Treatment for 10 weeks was more effective than for 4 weeks in lowering long-term pressure. Four weeks of treatment did not affect the mesenteric resistance artery media/lumen (m1/l1) ratio. In contrast, both losartan and captopril given for 10 weeks resulted in large and significant reductions in m1/l1 [5.3 +/- 0.8 and 5.63 +/- 0.8 vs 7.7 +/- 0.8 x 10(-2) (SD), p less than 0.001]. In losartan-treated rats, plasma renin and angiotensin II concentration were increased between 4- and 7-fold at the end of both treatment periods. These findings show losartan to be an effective antihypertensive agent and support data implicating angiotensin II in the early events leading to hypertension in this model. The abilities of losartan and captopril to affect blood pressure without affecting vascular structure suggest that the latter is a poor predictor of long-term hypertensive levels in the SHR.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) activate the prosurvival nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway by hyperacetylating RelA/p65, whereas the chemopreventive agent resveratrol inhibits NF-κB by activating the class III histone deacetylase Sirt1. Interactions between resveratrol and pan-HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) were examined in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. Pharmacologically achievable resveratrol concentrations (25-50 μM) synergistically potentiated HDACI lethality in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. Resveratrol antagonized RelA acetylation and NF-κB activation in HDACI-treated cells. However, short hairpin RNA Sirt1 knockdown failed to modify HDACI sensitivity, which suggests that factors other than or in addition to Sirt1 activation contribute to resveratrol/HDACI interactions. These interactions were associated with death receptor 5 (DR5) up-regulation and caspase-8 activation, whereas cells expressing dominant-negative caspase-8 were substantially protected from resveratrol/HDACI treatment, which suggests a significant functional role for the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in lethality. Exposure to resveratrol with HDACI induced sustained reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which was accompanied by increased levels of DNA double-strand breaks, as reflected in γH2A.X and comet assays. The free radical scavenger Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride blocked ROS generation, DR5 up-regulation, caspase-8 activation, DNA damage, and apoptosis, which indicates a primary role for oxidative injury in lethality. Analyses of cell-cycle progression and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation through flow cytometry revealed that resveratrol induced S-phase accumulation; this effect was abrogated by HDACI coadministration, which suggests that cells undergoing DNA synthesis may be particularly vulnerable to HDACI lethality. Collectively, these findings indicate that resveratrol interacts synergistically with HDACIs in AML cells through multiple ROS-dependent actions, including death receptor up-regulation, extrinsic apoptotic pathway activation, and DNA damage induction. They also raise the possibility that S-phase cells may be particularly susceptible to these actions.
In 1989, we began a multicenter study to evaluate the potential benefit of preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin, ifosfamide and mitomycin over surgery alone in CT-visible N2 non-small-cell lung cancer. We present here a 7-year assessment of this randomized trial. Sixty patients were randomized to receive either surgery alone or three cycles of mitomycin 6 mg/m2, ifosfamide 3 g/m2 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2, given intravenously on day 1 of each cycle at 3-week intervals and followed by surgery. All patients received thoracic irradiation after surgery. The resected tumors were evaluated for the presence of K-ras gene point mutations. Treatment arms were well-balanced in characteristics such as gender, age, histology, and tumor size. Mediastinoscopy and/or mediastinotomy (Chamberlain procedure) with a biopsy was performed in all patients with N2 stage detected by CT scan of the chest (83% of the patients in the preresectional chemotherapy arm and 63% of those in the surgery arm). In eight of the 25 patients (32%) who had mediastinoscopy in the preresectional chemotherapy arm, the initially positive mediastinal lymph nodes were downstaged. For the 30 patients who received preresectional chemotherapy, overall median survival was 22 months (95% CI, 13.4 30.6). Of the 30 patients who received surgery alone, overall median survival was 10 months (95% CI, 7.4-12.6; P = 0.005 by the log rank test). Updated survival data reveals a plateau in the preresectional chemotherapy group, and this still significant long-term survival benefit prompts us to hypothesize that even with short-term preresectional chemotherapy, the natural history of still resectable CT-visible N2 non-small cell lung cancer is favorably altered. The results of our study mirror the long-term survival recently reported in the MD Anderson randomized study.
Mitomycin C 40 mg in 40 ml water was administered intravesically every week for 8 consecutive weeks to 60 patients with superficial bladder cancer. All patients had failed treatment with intravesical thiotepa and had evaluable disease. An objective response of 50% or greater reduction in measured tumor mucosal involvement was obtained in 68% of patients. Forty-two percent of the patients achieved a complete response, and this included 50% of patients with Grade III disease and 70% of patients with a T1 tumor. Median response duration in complete responders was 12.2 months with a range of 3.5 to 24.3 + months. Fifty-five percent of patients are still responding. Therapy was generally well tolerated, and in contrast to thiotepa, myelosuppression was not the dose-limiting effect. One third of all patients experienced symptoms of local irritation, and skin reactions were seen in 12% of patients.
Long-term l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment in Parkinson's disease leads to dyskinesias in the majority of patients. The underlying molecular mechanisms for L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) are currently unclear. However, the findings that there are alterations in opioid peptide mRNA and protein expression and that opioid ligands modulate dyskinesias suggest that the opioid system may be involved. To further understand its role in dyskinesias, we mapped opioid receptor-stimulated G-protein activation using [35S]guanylyl-5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate ([35S]GTPgammaS) autoradiography in the basal ganglia of normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned squirrel monkeys administered water or L-DOPA. Subtype-selective opioid receptor G-protein coupling was investigated using the mu-opioid agonist [D-Ala, N-Me-Phe, Gly-ol]-enkephalin, delta-agonist SNC80 and kappa-agonist U50488H. Our data show that mu-opioid receptor-mediated G-protein activation is significantly enhanced in the basal ganglia and cortex of L-DOPA-treated dyskinetic monkeys, whereas delta- and kappa-receptor-induced increases were limited to only a few regions. A similar pattern of enhancement was observed in both MPTP-lesioned and unlesioned animals with LIDs suggesting the effect was not simply due to a compromised nigrostriatal system. Opioid receptor G-protein coupling was not enhanced in non-dyskinetic L-DOPA-treated animals, or lesioned monkeys not given L-DOPA. The increases in opioid-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding are directly correlated with dyskinesias. The present data demonstrate an enhanced subtype-selective opioid-receptor G-protein coupling in the basal ganglia of monkeys with LIDs. The positive correlation with LIDs suggests this may represent an intracellular signaling mechanism underlying these movement abnormalities.
