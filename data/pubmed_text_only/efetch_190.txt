This study was designed to investigate the ability of a chronic blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptors with losartan to reverse the endothelial dysfunction present in N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-treated hypertensive rats and the possible dependence of this effect on bradykinin B2-receptor activation.
Rats treated with L-NAME alone (60 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks) or with L-NAME + losartan, L-NAME + icatibant (a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist) and L-NAME + losartan + icatibant were studied. Losartan, icatibant or losartan + icatibant were co-administered with L-NAME during the last 4 weeks of the experiment. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene expression in aortic tissues, plasma nitrite/nitrate concentrations, the relaxant effect of acetylcholine on norepinephrine-precontracted aortic rings and 6-keto-PGF1alpha release from aortic rings were used as markers of the endothelial function.
Rats treated with L-NAME alone and L-NAME + icatibant showed, as compared with untreated animals, a clear-cut increase in systolic blood pressure and a decrease of all the markers of endothelial function evaluated. In L-NAME-rats, administration of losartan reduced the systolic blood pressure and restored endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene expression, plasma nitrite/nitrate levels, the relaxant activity of acetylcholine on aortic rings and the generation of 6-keto-PGF1alpha from the aortic tissues. Co-administration of icatibant with losartan blunted the stimulatory effect of losartan on the markers of endothelial function evaluated.
These results demonstrated that losartan is capable of reversing the endothelial vasodilator dysfunction in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats, and that the beneficial effect of losartan is mediated by bradykinin B2-receptor activation.
Integrins are heterodimeric cell-surface proteins that regulate cell growth, migration and survival. We have shown previously that the epithelial-restricted integrin alpha(v)beta6 has another critical function; that is, it binds and activates latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Through a global analysis of pulmonary gene expression in the lungs of mice lacking this integrin (Itgb6 null mice) we have identified a marked induction of macrophage metalloelastase (Mmp12)--a metalloproteinase that preferentially degrades elastin and has been implicated in the chronic lung disease emphysema. Here we report that Itgb6-null mice develop age-related emphysema that is completely abrogated either by transgenic expression of versions of the beta6 integrin subunit that support TGF-beta activation, or by the loss of Mmp12. Furthermore, we show that the effects of Itgb6 deletion are overcome by simultaneous transgenic expression of active TGF-beta1. We have uncovered a pathway in which the loss of integrin-mediated activation of latent TGF-beta causes age-dependent pulmonary emphysema through alterations of macrophage Mmp12 expression. Furthermore, we show that a functional alteration in the TGF-beta activation pathway affects susceptibility to this disease.
The time dependence of the ability of phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to protect adult hens from developing signs of paralysis following the administration of 750 mg/kg tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), p.o., of 1.7 mg/kg O,O-diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP), s.c., was investigated. PMSF was able to protect the hens from organophosphorus-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN) when given between 1 and 24 h before the administration of TOCP, or when given 4 h before DFP. However, PMSF was ineffective at preventing paralysis when given 24 h following dosing with TOCP or when given later than 4 h before DFP administration. These results support the notion that PMSF acts at the same site as the organophosphorus esters.
The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) was studied in patients treated with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin. Thirty-two patients with germ cell cancer were followed for a median of 78 months (range, 49 to 106 months). All had obtained complete remission during treatment; none had relapsed at last follow-up examination. All blood samples, including serum magnesium, were normal. The arterial vasoconstrictor response to cold in the finger was measured by cuff- and strain-gauge techniques at 30, 15, and 10 degrees C. Blood pressure (BP) was measured auscultatorily, using a 12-cm broad cuff on the ipsilateral upper arm. Fourteen patients (44%) had developed anamnestic RP, and all showed an exaggerated response to cold; arterial closure was provoked in nine patients. Eighteen patients (56%) were without finger symptoms. These patients had an exaggerated response to cold in comparison with controls, and in two patients, RP was provoked. None of the patients had an increased systolic pressure gradient from arm to finger when compared with a control group. Thus, an exaggerated cold response was found to be a prolonged vasospastic side effect not only in patients with RP, but also in patients without finger symptoms.
There is a critical need to find new antineoplastic drugs that are active in platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. We conducted a phase II trial of single-agent ifosfamide with mesna uroprotection in patients with ovarian cancer previously treated with an organoplatinum compound to assess its activity in this clinical setting.
Ifosfamide (1.0 or 1.2 g/m2/d for 5 days, delivered on a monthly schedule) was administered to the 57 patients entered onto this trial. Dose reductions were permitted for unacceptable toxicities.
Toxicity included severe bone marrow suppression (WBC count less than 1,000/microL and/or platelet count less than 50,000/microL), renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level greater than 2.0 mg/dL), and reversible CNS dysfunction (disorientation, hallucinations, somnolence, and agitation), which occurred in 20%, 14%, and 12% of patients, respectively. Of 41 patients with strictly defined platinum-refractory ovarian cancer, five (12%) demonstrated a partial (four) or complete (one) response to this treatment program.
Single-agent ifosfamide has modest but unequivocal activity in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Further studies of this drug used as a front-line agent along with an organoplatinum compound or as part of a dose-intensification program with bone marrow, peripheral stem cell, or colony-stimulating factor support are indicated. In addition, single-agent ifosfamide is a reasonable standard second-line treatment strategy in appropriately selected patients with platinum-refractory ovarian cancer.
Asthma exacerbations are among the most frequent causes of hospitalization during childhood, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide association study of a specific asthma phenotype characterized by recurrent, severe exacerbations occurring between 2 and 6 years of age in a total of 1,173 cases and 2,522 controls. Cases were identified from national health registries of hospitalization, and DNA was obtained from the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank. We identified five loci with genome-wide significant association. Four of these, GSDMB, IL33, RAD50 and IL1RL1, were previously reported as asthma susceptibility loci, but the effect sizes for these loci in our cohort were considerably larger than in the previous genome-wide association studies of asthma. We also obtained strong evidence for a new susceptibility gene, CDHR3 (encoding cadherin-related family member 3), which is highly expressed in airway epithelium. These results demonstrate the strength of applying specific phenotyping in the search for asthma susceptibility genes.
The influence of thymic hormone's short fragments: thymopentin or T-5 (RKDVY), RKD and SKD, on behaviour and neurochemical processes (contents of GABA and monoamines in the brain and adrenals, plasma corticosterone), was investigated. The 100 and 500 micrograms/kg doses i.p. prevented alterations in rat's brain GABA content and plasma corticosterone level, as well as elicited anxiolytic activity in a conflict test. T-5 exerted antidepressant activity, too. SKD potentiated the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The data obtained suggest a multicomponent (CNS-activating and inhibiting) mechanism of action of the thymic hormone fragments. These fragments seem to be formed endogenously during thymic hormone bioprocessing and may act as regulatory neuropeptides.
Atrial natriuretic peptide and long acting natriuretic peptide have anticancer effects in human prostate adenocarcinomas.
Atrial natriuretic peptide, long acting natriuretic peptide and cyclic GMP's effects on MEK 1/2 kinase were examined in human prostate adenocarcinoma cells.
Atrial natriuretic peptide and long acting natriuretic peptide decreased the activation of MEK 1/2 over a concentration range of 0.01 microM to 10 microM. Long acting natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide (each 10 microM) inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK 1/2 kinase 97% (p < 0.00001) and 88% (p < 0.00001), respectively. The inhibition of MEK 1/2 was maximal at two hours, and ceased by four hours, secondary to both peptides. The ability of peptides to inhibit MEK 1/2 was inhibited by cyclic GMP antibody and cyclic GMP itself inhibited MEK 1/2 phosphorylation by 93%.
Atrial natriuretic peptide and long acting natriuretic peptide both inhibit MEK 1/2 kinase mediated via cyclic GMP as part of their anticancer mechanism(s) of action.
Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA), a distinct clinical syndrome affecting about 10% of adult asthmatics, appears to be unusually dependent on cysteine leukotriene (cys-LT) overproduction by pulmonary eosinophils. The gene coding for leukotriene (LT) C(4) synthase (LTC(4)S), the enzyme controlling cys-LT biosynthesis, exists as two common alleles distinguished by an A to C transversion at a site 444 nucleotides upstream of the translation start. We tested the hypothesis that this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affects binding of transcription factors and influences the transcription rate, predisposing to AIA. Gel shift assay studies revealed that the (-444)C allele, conferring an activator protein-2 binding sequence, is an additional target for a transcription factor of histone H4 consensus. Introduction of the H4TF-2 decoy oligonucleotide into LTC(4)S-positive, differentiated HL-60 cells decreased accumulation of LTC(4) to 68%. Transfection of COS-7 with promoter construct increased expression of beta-galactosidase reporter for the (-444)C variant. The (-444)C allelic frequency was significantly higher in AIA patients (n = 76) as compared with matched aspirin-tolerant asthmatics (n = 110) and healthy controls (n = 75). Patients with AIA had also upregulated LTC(4)S messenger RNA expression in peripheral blood eosinophils. An inhaled provocation test with lysine-aspirin led to an increase in urinary output of LTE(4), which reached statistical significance only in carriers of the (-444)C allele. Our results suggest that a transcription factor, present in dividing and bone marrow resident progenitors of eosinophils, triggers LTC(4)S transcription in carriers of a common (-444)C allele due to binding with the histone H4 promoter element of the gene. Genetic predisposition to cys-LT pathway upregulation, a hallmark of AIA, can be related to overactive expression of the LTC(4)S (-444)C allele.
This study was undertaken to elucidate the anticonvulsive effects of zonisamide (ZNS: 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]), which was coadministered with valproic acid (VPA: 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, i.p.), or phenytoin (PHT: 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg, i.p.) to ZNS concentration, nitric oxide metabolites (NOx levels), and monoamines in the brain of the EL mouse, a strain highly susceptible to seizures. NOx levels were obtained from measuring of combined level of nitrite plus nitrate. Coadministration of ZNS with VPA or PHT suppressed convulsive seizures more effectively than with treatment of ZNS alone. Both serum and brain concentrations of ZNS tended to increase as the dose of VPA or PHT was increased. While coadministrations of ZNS (75 mg/kg) and VPA or PHT at any dose did not change brain and serum NOx levels, those altered brain monoamine contents. These results suggested that anticonvulsive effect of coadministrations of ZNS and VPA or PHT were caused by changes of monoamines rather than changes of NO metabolites.
Many tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells, only some of which exhibit increased tumorigenicity and resistance to anticancer therapies. Evidence suggests that these aggressive cancer cells, often termed "cancer stem cells" or "cancer stem-like cells" (CSCs), rely upon developmental signaling pathways that are important for survival and expansion of normal stem cells. Here we report that, in analogy to embryonic mammary epithelial biology, estrogen signaling expands the pool of functional breast CSCs through a paracrine FGF/FGFR/Tbx3 signaling pathway. Estrogen or FGF9 pretreatment induced CSC properties of breast cancer cell lines and freshly isolated breast cancer cells, whereas cotreatment of cells with tamoxifen or a small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling was sufficient to prevent the estrogen-induced expansion of CSCs. Furthermore, reduction of FGFR or Tbx3 gene expression was able to abrogate tumorsphere formation, whereas ectopic Tbx3 expression increased tumor seeding potential by 100-fold. These findings demonstrate that breast CSCs are stimulated by estrogen through a signaling pathway that similarly controls normal mammary epithelial stem cell biology.
Lenz-Majewski syndrome (LMS) is a syndrome of intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies that features generalized craniotubular hyperostosis. By using whole-exome sequencing and selecting variants consistent with the predicted dominant de novo etiology of LMS, we identified causative heterozygous missense mutations in PTDSS1, which encodes phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PSS1). PSS1 is one of two enzymes involved in the production of phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine synthesis was increased in intact fibroblasts from affected individuals, and end-product inhibition of PSS1 by phosphatidylserine was markedly reduced. Therefore, these mutations cause a gain-of-function effect associated with regulatory dysfunction of PSS1. We have identified LMS as the first human disease, to our knowledge, caused by disrupted phosphatidylserine metabolism. Our results point to an unexplored link between phosphatidylserine synthesis and bone metabolism.
Lethal phenotypes of human prostate cancer are characterized by progression to androgen independence, although the mechanisms behind this progression remain unclear. Arsenic is a potential human prostate carcinogen that may affect tumor progression. In this study, we used a prostate cancer cell model in which an immortalized, nontumorigenic human prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) had been malignantly transformed by chronic low-level arsenic to help determine whether arsenic affects prostate tumor progression. Control and CAsE-PE (chronic-arsenic-exposed human prostate epithelial) cells were continuously maintained in a complete medium [keratinocyte serum-free medium (K-SFM) with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor] or in a steroid-depleted medium (K-SFM alone). The arsenic-transformed cells showed a more rapid proliferation rate in complete medium than did control cells and also showed sustained proliferation in steroid-reduced medium. Although both control and CAsE-PE cells showed similar levels of androgen receptor (AR), androgens were less effective in stimulating cell proliferation and AR-related gene expression in CAsE-PE cells. For instance, dihydrotestosterone caused a 4.5-fold increase in prostate-specific antigen transcript in control cells but only a 1.5-fold increase in CAsE-PE cells. CAsE-PE cells also showed relatively low levels of growth stimulation by nonandrogen steroids, such as estradiol. Thus, arsenic-induced malignant transformation is associated with acquired androgen independence in human prostate cells. This acquired androgen independence was apparently not due to AR up-regulation, increased activity, or altered ligand specificity. The precise manner in which arsenic altered CAsE-PE growth and progression is undefined but may involve a bypass of AR involving direct stimulation of downstream signaling pathways.
Two adolescents who developed severe extrapyramidal and hypothalamic reactions due to haloperidol therapy are describe. This is a rarely reported result of utilizing this medication in children and youth, and caution is urged in its use. Prolonged reactions have occurred.
To understand the genetic mechanisms driving variant and IGHV4-34-expressing hairy-cell leukemias, we performed whole-exome sequencing of leukemia samples from ten affected individuals, including six with matched normal samples. We identified activating mutations in the MAP2K1 gene (encoding MEK1) in 5 of these 10 samples and in 10 of 21 samples in a validation set (overall frequency of 15/31), suggesting potential new strategies for treating individuals with these diseases.
d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a neurometabolic disorder with both a mild and a severe phenotype and with unknown etiology. Recently, a novel enzyme, d-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which converts d-2-hydroxyglutarate into 2-ketoglutarate, and its gene were identified. In the genes of two unrelated patients affected with d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, we identified disease-causing mutations. One patient was homozygous for a missense mutation (c.1331T-->C; p.Val444Ala). The other patient was compound heterozygous for a missense mutation (c.440T-->G; p.Ile147Ser) and a splice-site mutation (IVS1-23A-->G) that resulted in a null allele. Overexpression studies in HEK-293 cells of proteins containing the missense mutations showed a marked reduction of d-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase activity, proving that mutations in the d-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase gene cause d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.
Platelet count, and plasma thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and circulating platelet aggregates (CPA) were determined in the coronary sinus (CS), aortic bulb (AO) and cubital vein (V) in 21 patients with stable angina and in 6 control subjects before and after atrial pacing (AP). TXB2 measurements were repeated before and after AP in 6 of the 21 angina patients after 15 days' sulphinpyrazone treatment. Platelet count and CPA ratio were similar in angina patients and controls at all three sampling sites and were unchanged at AP peak. In the controls, basal TXB2 values in CS, AO and V were not significantly different and were unchanged at AP peak. In the angina patients compared with the controls, basal TXB2 values in the AO, CS and V were not significantly different whereas the CS/AO TBX2 ratio was significantly higher; at AP-induced ischaemia, CS TXB2 was significantly increased and the CS/AO TXB2 ratio was increased. A weak but significant direct correlation was found between CS/AO TXB2 ratio and coronary score. Sulphinpyrazone treatment reduced CS TXB2 levels at rest and after AP, but not the ischaemic threshold at AP.
Hypertensive diabetic animal models have been developed by injecting streptozotocin (STZ) in neonatal stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSR) and stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP) at the age of two days. After the treatment, the animals showed mild insulin deficiency and mild hyperglycemia at the age of three to four months. Diabetic nephropathy was produced particularly in STZ-treated SHRSR at the age of six months. The effect of neonatal STZ injection on hyperglycemia varied among normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), SHRSR, and SHRSP; SHRSR showed the highest glucose levels, SHRSP showed intermediate levels, and WKY was the lowest. All STZ-treated SHRSR showed glycosuria, while glycosuria was not observed in the treated SHRSP and WKY. Histologic study indicated that these strain differences were partly ascribed to differences in islet B-cell sensitivity to toxic effects of STZ. The development of hypertension was not accelerated in these SHRSR and SHRSP compared with respective nontreated controls. Since STZ-treated SHRSR develop mild diabetic symptom with hypertension and develop mild diabetic glomerulosclerosis, they are good models for studying vascular complications or other problems relating to the synergism between hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
The incidence of low birth weights is increased in offspring of women who are exposed to high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water compared with other women. We hypothesized that effects of arsenic on birth weight may be related to effects on myogenic differentiation.
We investigated the effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on the myogenic differentiation of myoblasts in vitro and muscle regeneration in vivo.
C2C12 myoblasts and primary mouse and human myoblasts were cultured in differentiation media with or without As2O3 (0.1-0.5 microM) for 4 days. Myogenic differentiation was assessed by myogenin and myosin heavy chain expression and multinucleated myotube formation in vitro; skeletal muscle regeneration was tested using an in vivo mouse model with experimental glycerol myopathy.
A submicromolar concentration of As2O3 dose-dependently inhibited myogenic differentiation without apparent effects on cell viability. As2O3 significantly and dose-dependently decreased phosphorylation of Akt and p70s6k proteins during myogenic differentiation. As2O3-induced inhibition in myotube formation and muscle-specific protein expression was reversed by transfection with the constitutively active form of Akt. Sections of soleus muscles stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed typical changes of injury and regeneration after local glycerol injection in mice. Regeneration of glycerol-injured soleus muscles, myogenin expression, and Akt phosphorylation were suppressed in muscles isolated from As2O3-treated mice compared with untreated mice.
Our results suggest that As2O3 inhibits myogenic differentiation by inhibiting Akt-regulated signaling.
Formaldehyde (FA) is a common indoor air pollutant that can cause asthma in people experiencing long-term exposure. While FA and other man-made chemicals contribute to the stimulation of asthma in the general population, the underlying molecular pathogenesis of this relationship is not yet well understood.
To explore FA as an irritant for the onset of asthma and as an adjuvant for the induction of allergy.
In the present study, 40 Wistar rats in five experimental groups were exposed to: (i) saline; (ii) ovalbumin (OVA); (iii) OVA + FA at 417 ppb; (iv) OVA + FA at 2500 ppb; and (v) FA at 2500 ppb. Current and prior occupational exposure limits in China were established at 417 ppb and 2500 ppb, respectively. Gaseous FA was administrated to the animals for 6 h/day before and during OVA immunization or saline treatment. Measured outcomes included in situ lung function analysis, cytokine measurement, and histological changes in the rat lungs.
The airway reactivity, lung histological changes, pulmonary interleukin-4 secretion, and eosinophil infiltration in the OVA and FA exposed rats were significantly higher after gaseous FA exposures of 417 and 2500 ppb. While FA exposure alone did not induce significant structural changes to the airway, and the rate of inflammatory cell infiltration was the same as for the control group, pulmonary levels of interferon-gamma were significantly elevated in the exposed rats.
FA may be an irritant as well as serve as an adjuvant for the onset of asthma or asthma-like symptoms.
Intra-amygdaloid injections of folic acid (FA) in rats induce behavioural, metabolic (assessed using the 2-deoxyglucose method) and neuropathological changes which, however, differ considerably from those produced by kainic acid (KA). Thus FA, in contrast to KA, does not readily induce limbic motor seizures, fails to activate the entire limbic system and does not readily reproduce the local and distant damage induced by KA, notably in the Ammon's horn of the hippocampus. The results argue against the hypothesis that KA acts at folate receptors to induce its limbic epileptic/brain damage syndrome.
To examine whether niacin attenuates lung inflammation and improves survival during sepsis and to determine whether the beneficial effects of niacin are associated with downregulation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway.
Prospective laboratory study.
University laboratory.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 119).
To induce endotoxemia in rats, lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli, O26:B6) at a dosage of 10 mg/kg was injected into a tail vein and 10 mins later, vehicle, a low dose of niacin (360 mg/kg), or a high dose of niacin (1180 mg/kg) was administered once through an orogastric tube, respectively.
We observed the survival of the subjects for 72 hrs. At 6 hrs postlipopolysaccharide, we euthanized animals and measured cytoplasmic phosphorylated inhibitor κB-α and inhibitor κB-α expressions, nuclear NF-κB p65 expression, NF-κB p65 DNA-binding activity, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 gene expressions and histologic damages in lung tissues. We also measured nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced glutathione, and malondialdehyde levels in lung tissues. High dose of niacin suppressed NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine gene expressions in lung tissues, reduced histologic lung damages, and improved survival in endotoxemic rats. Furthermore, it increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and glutathione levels and decreased malondialdehyde level in lung tissues.
High dose of niacin attenuated lung inflammation, reduced histologic lung damages, and improved survival during sepsis in rats. These therapeutic benefits were associated with downregulation of the NF-κB pathway.
Earlier work suggested that adaptive mechanisms of the hibernating brain may also block the development of morphine physical dependence. To test an alternate view that CNS depression itself might be the major factor in the failure of dependence to develop, we compared the strength of dependence produced by morphine (two 75-mg pellets, s.c.) given for 12 hr in the presence, versus in the absence, of continuous pentobarbital anesthesia in nonhibernating ground squirrels (Citellus lateralis) and, in addition, in rats. Dependence was measured by the naloxone (5 mg/kg, s.c.) evoked abstinence syndrome in the awake state. The results demonstrated that pentobarbital-induced general anesthesia does not significantly reduce the development of morphine dependence in either species. We conclude that CNS depression alone does not account for the hibernation-related reduction in morphine physical dependence.
The main form of cytotoxic treatment for advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD) is conventional dose multiagents chemotherapy. As HD is not common in Japan, we conducted a phase II study of the commonly used combination chemotherapy (CCT) regimen established in the West for Japanese patients with advanced HD to confirm the efficacy and safety.
Between October 1989 and February 1993, a multicenter phase II study of alternating CCT C-MOPP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone) and ABVd (adriamycin, vinblastine, bleomycin, dacarbazine) to evaluate its clinical usefulness for clinical stage (cS) II-IV HD was conducted by the Lymphoma Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group.
Seventy-nine previously untreated patients were enrolled in the study. For 67 eligible patients, the response rate was 92.5% with 83.6% complete response (CR). For 40 cS II and 27 cS III/IV patients the response rate was 95.0% with 90.0% CR and 88.9% with 74.1% CR, respectively. The overall 5-year survival rate was 84.8%. Those of cS II and cS III/IV were 92.5 and 73.1%, respectively. There was no significant difference between cS II and cS III/IV (p = 0.1025). The progression-free 4-year survival rate was 72.8%. Those of cS II and cS III/IV were 77.5 and 65.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference between cS II and cS III/IV (p = 0.2483). Grade 4 toxicity by the criteria of the World Health Organization consisted of leukocytopenia in 28.4% of patients. There was GPT elevation in 4.5%, nausea/vomiting in 11.9% and CNS in 1.5% of patients, but there was no treatment-related death.
The C-MOPP/ABVd regimen for Japanese patients with advanced HD is considered to be one of the effective CCTs according to the results of the present phase II study.
To determine how and why different bronchodilators affect ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) relationships differently in experimental asthma, 10 anesthetized dogs were exposed 3 times each (2-1/2 h apart) to aerosolized 1% methacholine over 3 to 5 min. Mechanical, hemodynamic, gas exchange, and catecholamine concentration measurements were made before challenge, and 10, 20, 30, and 135 min after challenge. Fifteen min after challenge the dogs were exposed to aerosolized epinephrine, isoproterenol, salbutamol, or isotonic saline in random order. The worsened V/Q inequality after isoproterenol paralleled increased cardiac output (QT) and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Because of increased QT, arterial PO2 (PaO2) did not fall in spite of the increased V/Q inequality. After administration of isoproterenol, improvement in air-flow obstruction was always associated with significantly less increase in mean PaO2 and more V/Q inequality than after saline. After epinephrine and salbutamol a similar significant decrease in airflow obstruction was associated with only slightly more V/Q mismatching than after saline. The effects of epinephrine on low V/Q ratio areas, shunt, PaO2, QT, heart rate, and PVR were less and of shorter duration than those of isoproterenol. Salbutamol resulted in changes similar to but more persistent than those induced by epinephrine. All variables approached prechallenge values within 2 h after bronchodilator administration, regardless of agent used. These studies show that in a repeatable canine asthma model, randomized administration of epinephrine, isoproterenol, and salbutamol produce different gas exchange responses in spite of similar improvements in air-flow obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
