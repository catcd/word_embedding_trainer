Aberrant activation of oncogenes, such as Ras, likely contributes to the development of hepatocarcinoma (HCC).
We evaluated in vivo the effect of intraperitoneal injections of the Ras inhibitor S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicyclic acid (FTS) on Ras activation and the development of preneoplastic liver lesions in rats receiving weekly diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injections for 16weeks. Western blotting, quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, Tunel and caspase activity assays were used.
FTS prevents liver nodule formation and reduces foci expressing the tumour marker GSTp. FTS abrogates DEN-induced Ras membrane activity, increases Tunel positive cells in transformed, GSTp-expressing hepatocytes, up-regulates caspase 3 and 8 activity, induces Fas, Fas ligand and JNK phosphorylation that occurs independently of TNFalpha and Trail. Cytochrome C release, Bax, Bcl2, Bcl-xl, Ki67 and nuclear cyclin D expression is not affected by FTS.
FTS inhibits Ras activation and prevents preneoplastic liver nodule development by inducing apoptosis in transformed hepatocytes through activation of the Fas/Fas ligand system. FTS might be new molecule for HCC treatment.
Neurological complications after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) have remained a major concern in a small proportion of patients. The etiology of these complications is often thought to be multifactorial: the influence of calcineurin inhibitors is occasionally thought to play an important role. When neurotoxicity occurs after OLTX under tacrolimus, it is usually a minor complication and responds readily to a reduction in the dosage of or a temporary withdrawal of tacrolimus. However, neurotoxic complications occasionally do not respond to this conventional process. Neoral is a microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine. It has more consistent pharmacokinetic parameters and improved bioavailability when compared with conventional cyclosporine. The aim of the present report was to evaluate the role of Neoral in OLTX recipients with neurotoxic complication who failed to respond to a reduction in the dosage of tacrolimus.
Between August 1995 and November 1997, 330 adults (age >18 years) received primary OLTX under tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (mean age 52.6+/-11.4 years). There were 190 men and 140 women. Twenty-three (7%) patients (mean age 53.2+/-11.8 years; 17 men, 6 women) were converted to Neoral (mean 35+/-41 days after OLTX). These patients were followed until June 1998 (mean follow-up 22.7+/-7.8 months).
Four (17.4%) patients died during the follow-up period, and two patients underwent retransplantation. Neurological symptoms improved in all patients who survived. Adequate trough concentrations were achieved in all patients with p.o. Neoral. Nine (39%) patients experienced rejection episodes after conversion. Six (26.1%) patients were converted back to tacrolimus because of ongoing rejection (n=3), retransplantation (n=2), or persistent nausea and vomiting (n=1) without recurrence of the original neurological complication.
Neurological complications after OLTX disorders that occur under tacrolimus and that fail to respond to a reduction in the dosage can be treated safely by conversion to Neoral. However, the rate of rejection is up to 39%, and patients can often be converted back to tacrolimus without recurrence of the original neurological complication.
The aim of the study was to compare the ability of dobutamine and dipyridamole echocardiography to detect stunned but viable myocardium early after acute myocardial infarction, to predict spontaneous functional recovery of the reperfused myocardium at 2 months and to detect myocardial ischemia in the infarcted area. Within 10 days from acute myocardial infarction, 47 patients, 29 anterior and 18 inferior, 41 Q-wave and 6 non Q-wave infarctions, underwent dobutamine echocardiography test at low-dose (5-10 mcg/kg/min over 5 min) and high-dose (20-40 mgc/kg/min over 3 min) and to dipyridamole echocardiography test (0.56 mg/kg over 4 min + 0.28 mg/kg over 2 min) in different days and in random order, after interruption of any vasoactive drug. Resting echocardiography was repeated at 2 months in 38/47 patients. Regional wall motion analysis was performed in a qualitative manner on a 14-segment model; viability was defined as improvement of 1 grade or more of at least 2 basally asynergic segments in the infarcted area. Ischemia was defined as an improvement followed by significant deterioration of contractility of the infarcted segments or deterioration of the infarcted area. All patients underwent coronary arteriography within 1 month from admission. Viability was detected by low-dose dobutamine in 34/47 patients (72%) and in 131/297 (44%) of basally asynergic segments compared to only 21/47 patients (45%) and in 66/297 segments (22%) detected by dipyridamole; myocardial ischemia was induced by dobutamine in 64% of patients compared to 36% by dipyridamole. Late spontaneous functional recovery was detected in 21/38 patients (57%) and in 70/244 (29%) of asynergic segments. Sensitivity of dobutamine and dipyridamole echocardiography for predicting spontaneous functional recovery was 70% and 46% specificity 69% and 83%, positive predictive value 48% and 52%, negative predictive value 85% and 79% respectively. Dobutamine correctly identified the presence of a significant stenosis of the infarct-related artery in 74% of cases compared with 43% of dipyridamole; specificity for detecting stenosis was 67% for dobutamine and 83% for dipyridamole. In conclusion, in patients with thrombolyzed myocardial infarction dobutamine echocardiography detects viable myocardium with late spontaneous recovery in a greater proportion of patients and segments than dipyridamole; dobutamine has a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity compared to dipyridamole for identifying a residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery that may jeopardize myocardium in the area at risk.
We have tested for anti-nociceptive effects of the anticonvulsant KCNQ channel opener, N-(2-amino-4-(4-fluorobenzylamino)-phenyl)carbamic acid ethyl ester (retigabine), in rat models of experimental pain. In the chronic constriction injury and spared nerve models of neuropathic pain, injection of retigabine (5 and 20 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated (P<0.05) mechanical hypersensitivity in response to pin prick stimulation of the injured hindpaw. In contrast, retigabine had no effect on mechanical hypersensitivity to von Frey stimulation of the injured hindpaw in either model. Cold sensitivity in response to ethyl chloride was only attenuated (P<0.05) in the chronic constriction injury model. In the formalin test, retigabine (20 mg/kg, p.o.) attenuated flinching behaviour in the second phase compared with vehicle (P<0.05), and this effect was completely reversed by the KCNQ channel blocker 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone (XE-991; 3 mg/kg, i.p.). Neither retigabine nor XE-991 administration affected the latency to respond to noxious thermal stimulation of the tail in control animals. These results suggest that retigabine may prove to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
The nucleus accumbens is a forebrain region that mediates cocaine self-administration and withdrawal effects in animal models of cocaine dependence. Considerable evidence suggests an important role of dopamine D1 receptors in these effects. Using a combination of current-clamp recordings in brain slices and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from freshly dissociated neurons, we found that nucleus accumbens neurons are less excitable in cocaine withdrawn rats because of a novel form of plasticity: reduced whole-cell sodium currents. Three days after discontinuation of repeated cocaine injections, nucleus accumbens neurons recorded in brain slices were less responsive to depolarizing current injections, had higher action potential thresholds, and had lower spike amplitudes. Freshly dissociated nucleus accumbens neurons from cocaine-pretreated rats exhibited diminished sodium current density and a depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of sodium channel activation. These effects appear to be related to enhanced basal phosphorylation of sodium channels because of increased transmission through the dopamine D1 receptor/cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. The effects of repeated cocaine administration were not mimicked by repeated injections of the local anesthetic lidocaine and were not observed in neurons within the motor cortex, indicating that they did not result from local anesthetic actions of cocaine. Because nucleus accumbens neurons are normally recruited to coordinate response patterns of movement and affect, the decreased excitability during cocaine withdrawal may be related to symptoms such as anergia, anhedonia, and depression.
Currently, over 400 cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix occurring in females born after 1940 have been accessioned into the Registry for Research on Hormonal Transplacental Carcinogenesis. Cases have been identified throughout the United States as well as Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Intrauterine exposure to DES and similar nonsteroidal estrogens have been uncovered in about two-thirds of the cases with an available maternal history. A peak in the age incidence curve of the DES-related cases has been observed at about 19 years with the age range being 7-30 years. The five-year survival for 400 patients has been 80%. Numerous nonmalignant epithelial changes have been observed. It appears that there has not been an increase in the occurrence of premalignant or malignant squamous cell lesions among the DES exposed. Premature birth has been more common among DES-exposed women. For those in whom there is evidence of a midpregnancy loss or premature ripening of the cervix during pregnancy, a cerclage procedure has been effective in producing a desirable outcome.
CYP2C9 is the main enzyme participating in warfarin metabolism, of which genetic polymorphism is typical. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of having allelic variants CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 on the pharmacokinetics, dosage regimen, and the rate of hemorrhage in patients with constant atrial fibrillation taking warfarin. Eighty-two patients with constant atrial fibrillation taking warfarin were included in the study. It was shown that in patients with CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 the clearance of warfarin and its dose were lower, while the episodes of excessive hypocoagulation and hemorrhage associated with warfarin were more frequent than in patients without these allelic variants. Basing on the results of the study, the authors propose an algorithm of choosing the initial warfarin dose depending on CYP2C9 genotype.
In the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in 8245 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at a dosage of 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily, or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. Lovastatin produced sustained, dose-related (P less than .001) changes as follows (for dosages of 20 to 80 mg/d): decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level (24% to 40%), increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level (6.6% to 9.5%), decreased total cholesterol level (17% to 29%), and decreased triglyceride level (10% to 19%). The National Cholesterol Education Program's low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level goal of less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) was achieved by 80% to 96% of patients, while the less than 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) goal was achieved by 38% to 83% of patients. The difference between lovastatin and placebo in the incidence of clinical adverse experiences requiring discontinuation was small, ranging from 1.2% at 20 mg twice daily to 1.9% at 80 mg/d. Successive transaminase level elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal were observed in 0.1% of patients receiving placebo and 20 mg/d of lovastatin, increasing to 0.9% in those receiving 40 mg/d and 1.5% in those receiving 80 mg/d of lovastatin (P less than .001 for trend). Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with a creatine kinase elevation greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was found in only one patient (0.1%) receiving 40 mg once daily and four patients (0.2%) receiving 80 mg/d of lovastatin. Thus, lovastatin, when added after an adequate trial of a prudent diet, is a highly effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia.
Co-administration of niacin with statin offers the potential for additional lipid management and cardiovascular risk reduction. However, niacin is underutilised because of the side effects of flushing, mediated primarily by prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)). A combination tablet containing extended-release niacin and laropiprant (ERN/LRPT), a PGD(2) receptor (DP1) antagonist, offers improved tolerability. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of ERN/LRPT added to statin vs. doubling the dose of statin in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia who were not at their National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal based on their coronary heart disease risk category (high, moderate or low).
After a 2- to 6-week run-in statin (simvastatin 10 or 20 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg) period, 1216 patients were randomised equally to one of two treatment groups in a double-blind fashion: group 1 received ERN/LRPT (1 g) plus the run-in statin dose and advanced to ERN/LRPT (2 g) after 4 weeks for an additional 8 weeks, with no adjustments to the run-in statin dose; group 2 received simvastatin or atorvastatin at twice their run-in statin dose and remained on this stable dose for 12 weeks.
ERN/LRPT added to statin (pooled across statin and statin dose) significantly improved key lipid parameters vs. the doubled statin dose (pooled): the between-treatment group difference in least squares mean per cent change [95% confidence interval (CI)] from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C (primary end-point) was -4.5% (-7.7, -1.3) and in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 15.6% (13.4, 17.9) and in median per cent change for triglyceride (TG) was -15.4% (-19.2, -11.7). Treatment-related adverse experiences (AEs) related to flushing, pruritis, rash, gastrointestinal upset and elevations in liver transaminases and fasting serum glucose occurred more frequently with ERN/LRPT added to statin vs. statin dose doubled.
The addition of ERN/LRPT to ongoing statin treatment produced significantly improved lipid-modifying benefits on LDL-C, HDL-C and TG and all other lipid parameters compared with doubling the statin dose in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia. The types of AEs that occurred at a greater frequency in the ERN/LRPT group were those typically associated with niacin.
A 61 year old man, treated with amiodarone since 1993 for resistant supraventricular arrhythmias, developed acute hepatitis after an intravenous amiodarone administration. Kidney and liver function tests were performed and pointed out abnormal results. Symptoms ascribable to hepatotoxicity were absent. These changes returned to normal levels within 20 days from withdrawal of the drug. Amiodarone hepatotoxicity can be related to prolonged therapy with a high dose. Intravenous amiodarone may cause acute hepatic disease, but it is suggested that polysorbate 80, a solvent added to the intravenous infusion, is a more likely cause of this complication.
Gemcitabine and cisplatin are commonly used in chemotherapy, however, these drugs may cause severe cytotoxic side effects. Theophylline and aminophylline are commonly used as anti-asthma drugs and can block anti-phosphodiesterase activity. We examined whether these methylxanthins could effect lung cancer cell survival and synergise with gemcitabine and cisplatin to induce apoptosis. We found that theophylline induced apoptosis in the cultured H1299 cell line already at concentrations of 30 microg/ml, reaching an ED50% at 100 microg/ml. In contrast, aminophylline induced apoptosis at concentrations of 300 microg/ml and 17% apoptosis was evident at concentrations as high as 900 microg/ml, which is a lethal dose for in vivo treatment. Cisplatin induced apoptosis with ED50% of 0.8 microg/ml, while gemcitabine induced apoptosis with ED50% of 20 ng/ml. Using a combination of 20 microg/ml of theophylline (calculated as an effective but not toxic anti-asthma drug) with 10 ng/ml gemcitabine or with 0.3 microg/ml cisplatin significantly elevated incidence of apoptosis compared to gemcitabine or cisplatin alone at similar concentrations. In contrast, an observed synergistic effect between aminophylline and gemcitabine was evident only at concentrations of 80 microg/ml and 10 ng/ml respectively. However, no effect was apparent in combination doses of aminophylline (80 microg/ml) with cisplatin (0.3 microg/ml). The combined treatments involved reduction in the intracellular level of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene product. This corresponded with the extent of apoptosis induced by the various drug combinations. Thus, theophylline is significantly more effective than aminophylline in increasing the sensitivity of the H1299 lung cancer cells to the induction of cell death by gemcitabine and cisplatin. Thus, combination of theophylline with these drugs may permit a reduction in the effective dose needed in chemotherapy treatment of lung cancer patients.
Paclitaxel is a microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent used in ovarian and breast cancer; its principal adverse effect is sensory neuropathy. We describe the occurrence of sensory polyneuropathy after multiple paclitaxel-eluting stents in a patient who may have sub-clinical Sjogrens syndrome.
Raf/MEK/Erk signaling is activated in the majority of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), providing rationale for targeting this pathway with therapeutic intent. We investigated growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib in AML. Our studies demonstrated that sorafenib significantly inhibited the phosphorylation levels of Raf downstream target proteins MEK1/2 and Erk, induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in AML cell lines and in primary AML samples. Mechanistically, treatment with sorafenib resulted in upregulation of proapoptotic Bim, accompanied by an increase in Bad, Bax and Bak protein levels and decreased Mcl-1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and surviving levels, which mainly led to the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Silencing of Bim protein expression significantly abrogated sorafenib-induced apoptosis, suggesting a critical function of Bim in the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway induced by sorafenib. Importantly, sorafenib also modulated phospho-Erk, Bim, Bax and Mcl-1 levels in samples procured from patients in an ongoing Phase I clinical trial of sorafenib in AML. Combination of sorafenib with cytarabine or the novel small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 synergistically induced cell death in AML cell lines. Our results strongly suggest potential activity of sorafenib as a novel mechanism-based therapeutic agent in AML.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of hypokinetic arrhythmias, bradycardiac (BR) and hypotensive reactions in a population of 775 patients during dobutamine stress test (DST): 281 patients (36.2%, group I) were symptomatic for thoracic pain without any history of coronary artery disease (CAD); 494 patients (63.8%, group II) were evaluated 3-4 weeks after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to stratify ischemic risk. None of these patients was receiving coronarodilating therapy.
DST was performed using an infusion of 5, 10, 20, 40 micrograms/kg/min for 5 minutes during the first two stages and for 3 minutes during subsequent stages, and was accompanied by EKG and echocardiographic monitoring. BR was defined as severe when heart rate diminished more than 40 b/min, moderate when the decrease ranged between 20 and 39 b/min, and mild when the decrease was less than 20 b/min.
A total of 34 (4.38%) BR were observed, 19 (55%) in group I and 15 (45%) in group II. BR were severe in 12 patients (35.9%), 3 with recent AMI (2 inferior and 1 anterior) and 9 without a history of CAD. Fifteen (45%) presented moderate BR, 8 with recent AMI (6 inferior and 2 anterior); 7 cases were in group I. Mild BR was observed in 7 patients (20%), 2 with recent AMI (1 inferior, 1 anterior), of which 5 were in group I. Episodes of junctional rhythm were also observed in 10 patients (29.4%) and 1 patient (2.9%) presented 2nd degree AV block during DST positive for ischemia. The mean duration of bradycardic episodes was 89.6 seconds (+/- 29.8) and only 3 patients (8.8%) presented significant hypotension. In 13 patients (38.2%) arrhythmia was observed during dobutamine-induced ischemia. In spite of the often severely diminished heart rate, no significant hypotension was evident during the bradycardiac episode in 19 patients (55%). Only one patient (2.9%) showed a decrease of more than 40 mmHg.
In conclusion, we found that the incidence of BR during DST (4.38%) is higher than that reported in the literature; moreover, patients with recent inferior AMI showed a higher incidence of BR compared to patients with AMI in other sites (9 vs 4, p = n.s.). We feel that ischemia alone may not be responsible for hypokinetic arrhythmia during DST, but that dobutamine-induced neurovegetative reflexes may also contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the phenomenon.
We evaluated the severity of motor disability and dyskinesias in seven levodopa-responsive patients with Parkinson's disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist, apomorphine, before and after the administration of fluoxetine (20 mg twice per day) for 11 +/- 1 days. After fluoxetine treatment, there was a significant 47% improvement (p < 0.05) of apomorphine-induced dyskinesias without modification of parkinsonian motor disability. The dyskinesias were reduced predominantly in the lower limbs during the onset and disappearance of dystonic dyskinesias (onset- and end-of-dose dyskinesias) and in the upper limbs during choreic mid-dose dyskinesias. The results suggest that increased brain serotoninergic transmission with fluoxetine may reduce levodopa- or dopamine agonist-induced dyskinesias without aggravating parkinsonian motor disability.
Ulcerative colitis is a nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by oxidative and nitrosative stress, leucocyte infiltration and upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, with multiple pharmacological actions, mainly anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumour and immunomodulatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary resveratrol on chronic dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Six-week-old mice were randomized into two dietary groups: one standard diet and the other enriched with resveratrol at 20mg/kg of diet. After 30days, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5days developing acute colitis that progressed to severe chronic inflammation after 21days of water. Our results demonstrated that resveratrol group significantly attenuated the clinical signs such as loss of body weight, diarrhea and rectal bleeding improving results from disease activity index and inflammatory score. Moreover, the totality of resveratrol-fed animals survived and finished the treatment while animals fed with standard diet showed a mortality of 40%. Three weeks after DSS removal, the polyphenol caused substantial reductions of the rise of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and an increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Also resveratrol reduced prostaglandin E synthase-1 (PGES-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins expression, via downregulation of p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signal pathway. We conclude that resveratrol diet represents a novel approach to the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation.
Central corneal thickness (CCT) is associated with eye conditions including keratoconus and glaucoma. We performed a meta-analysis on >20,000 individuals in European and Asian populations that identified 16 new loci associated with CCT at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). We further showed that 2 CCT-associated loci, FOXO1 and FNDC3B, conferred relatively large risks for keratoconus in 2 cohorts with 874 cases and 6,085 controls (rs2721051 near FOXO1 had odds ratio (OR) = 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-1.88, P = 2.7 × 10(-10), and rs4894535 in FNDC3B had OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.29-1.68, P = 4.9 × 10(-9)). FNDC3B was also associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (P = 5.6 × 10(-4); tested in 3 cohorts with 2,979 cases and 7,399 controls). Further analyses implicate the collagen and extracellular matrix pathways in the regulation of CCT.
Effects of acute and long term clonidine treatment on motor and exploratory activities in rats were investigated in the presence and absence of imipramine. Rats received saline (control), clonidine HCl (0.8 mg/kg), imipramine HCl (30 mg/kg) and clonidine in combination with imipramine for 15 days. Clonidine caused hypoactivity and loss of interest and investment in the environment both acutely (on day 1) and chronically (on day 15). These effects of clonidine were reversed by acute and chronic imipramine pretreatments. Chronic clonidine treatment seemed more suitable in producing a model for depression in rats.
In order to study the influence of labetalol on the peroperative oxygenation during deliberate hypotension, 50 patients undergoing middle ear microsurgery were randomly divided in two groups of 25 patients; one group receiving labetalol to induce hypotension, the other group receiving placebo in a double blind manner. In the group receiving labetalol the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) decreased significantly 5 minutes after the intravenous bolus injection. Within 30 minutes the PaO2 returned to the starting level. The arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) increased within 5 minutes and also returned to the initial level after 30 minutes. These changes were absent in the control group. It is concluded that, although labetalol produces a statistically significant change in PaO2 and PaCO2, this finding has only minor clinical implications and so labetalol remains a safe drug to be used for the induction of deliberate hypotension during middle ear microsurgery.
Estrogen receptor α (ERα) acts as a transcription factor by virtue of the ability of its DNA-binding (DB) domain, comprised of a tandem pair of zinc fingers, to recognize the estrogen response element within the promoters of target genes. Herein, using an array of biophysical methods, we probe the structural consequences of the replacement of zinc within the DB domain of ERα with various environmental metals and their effects on the thermodynamics of binding to DNA. Our data reveal that whereas the DB domain reconstituted with divalent ions of zinc, cadmium, mercury, and cobalt binds to DNA with affinities in the nanomolar range, divalent ions of barium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, and tin are unable to regenerate DB domain with DNA-binding potential, although they can compete with zinc for coordinating the cysteine ligands within the zinc fingers. We also show that the metal-free DB domain is a homodimer in solution and that the binding of various metals only results in subtle secondary and tertiary structural changes, implying that metal coordination may only be essential for binding to DNA. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic insights into how environmental metals may modulate the physiological function of a key nuclear receptor involved in mediating a plethora of cellular functions central to human health and disease.
Some central effects of opipramol administered repeatedly (twice daily, 14 days) were studied in rats and mice. Repeated or acute treatment with opipramol did not change the locomotor activity of rats. Given repeatedly, but not in a single dose, opipramol increased the (+)-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. The (+)-amphetamine-induced stereotypy was unchanged by acute or repeated treatment with opipramol. The aggressiveness induced by clonidine in mice was attenuated by a single dose of opipramol, but it was markedly enhanced after repeated treatment with this drug. The immobility time of rats (behavioral despair test) was prolonged by a single dose of opipramol; when given three times, opipramol reduced the immobility time. The obtained results seem to indicate that repeated treatment with opipramol leads to similar effects in the experimental models as those after repeated treatment with typical antidepressant drugs, i.e. enhancement of the responses mediated by dopamine receptors (probably in the limbic system, but not in the striatum) and alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the brain.
Chelidonine administered to rats in doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg ip exerted an inhibitory effect on the dopaminergic structures in the rat. It was shown that chelidonine decreased amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced hyperactivity and inhibited amphetamine and apomorphine sterotype. Besides, chelidonine significantly inhibited the yawning and penile erection produced by apomorphine. However, chelidonine potentiated also catalepsy caused by haloperidol. In doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg ip chelidonine depressed the whole brain dopamine (DA) concentrations and enhanced DA utilization.
To identify susceptibility loci for visceral leishmaniasis, we undertook genome-wide association studies in two populations: 989 cases and 1,089 controls from India and 357 cases in 308 Brazilian families (1,970 individuals). The HLA-DRB1-HLA-DQA1 locus was the only region to show strong evidence of association in both populations. Replication at this region was undertaken in a second Indian population comprising 941 cases and 990 controls, and combined analysis across the three cohorts for rs9271858 at this locus showed P(combined) = 2.76 × 10(-17) and odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-1.52. A conditional analysis provided evidence for multiple associations within the HLA-DRB1-HLA-DQA1 region, and a model in which risk differed between three groups of haplotypes better explained the signal and was significant in the Indian discovery and replication cohorts. In conclusion, the HLA-DRB1-HLA-DQA1 HLA class II region contributes to visceral leishmaniasis susceptibility in India and Brazil, suggesting shared genetic risk factors for visceral leishmaniasis that cross the epidemiological divides of geography and parasite species.
Melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, is very aggressive and resistant to present therapies. The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) has been reported to be constitutively active in many types of cancer. Constitutively active NF-kappaB seen in melanoma likely plays a central role in cell survival and growth. We have established and characterized novel cell lines from our murine melanoma model. Here we report the constitutive activity of NF-kappaB in these melanoma-derived cells, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and reporter assays. We hypothesized that agents that inhibit NF-kappaB may also inhibit cell proliferation and may induce apoptosis in such melanoma cells. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit NF-kappaB activity in several cell types. In our system, curcumin selectively inhibited growth of melanoma cells, but not normal melanocytes. Curcumin induced melanoma cells to undergo apoptosis, as shown by caspase-3 activation, inversion of membrane phosphatidyl serine, and increases in cells in the sub-G1 phase. A curcumin dose-dependent inhibition of NF-kappaB-driven reporter activity correlated with decreased levels of phospho-IkappaBalpha, and decreased expression of NF-kappaB-target genes COX-2 and cyclin D1. This study demonstrates that the use of cells from our model system can facilitate studies of signaling pathways in melanoma. We furthermore conclude that curcumin, a natural and safe compound, inhibits NF-kappaB activity and the expression of its downstream target genes, and also selectively induces apoptosis of melanoma cells but not normal melanocytes. These encouraging in-vitro results support further investigation of curcumin for treatment of melanoma in vivo.
Individuals with Behçet's disease suffer from episodic inflammation often affecting the orogenital mucosa, skin and eyes. To discover new susceptibility loci for Behçet's disease, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 779,465 SNPs with imputed genotypes in 1,209 Turkish individuals with Behçet's disease and 1,278 controls. We identified new associations at CCR1, STAT4 and KLRC4. Additionally, two SNPs in ERAP1, encoding ERAP1 p.Asp575Asn and p.Arg725Gln alterations, recessively conferred disease risk. These findings were replicated in 1,468 independent Turkish and/or 1,352 Japanese samples (combined meta-analysis P < 2 × 10(-9)). We also found evidence for interaction between HLA-B*51 and ERAP1 (P = 9 × 10(-4)). The CCR1 and STAT4 variants were associated with gene expression differences. Three risk loci shared with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis (the MHC class I region, ERAP1 and IL23R and the MHC class I-ERAP1 interaction), as well as two loci shared with inflammatory bowel disease (IL23R and IL10) implicate shared pathogenic pathways in the spondyloarthritides and Behçet's disease.
Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that tea may be protective towards cancers of the GI tract. White tea, the least processed form of tea, contains high levels of polyphenols and, like green tea, is chemopreventive towards heterocyclic amine-initiated colonic aberrant crypt formation in male F344 rats. We examined for the first time the relative effectiveness of white and green tea in suppressing intestinal tumorigenesis in C57BL/6J-Apc(Min/+) (Apc(min)) mice. Each tea was also compared with sulindac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug known to be highly effective in Apc(min) mice. Male C57BL/6J (+/+) (wild-type) and Apc(min) mice were treated in the drinking water with white tea or green tea (1.5% w/v, 2 min brew-time), 80 p.p.m. sulindac, a combination of 80 p.p.m. sulindac in 1.5% white tea, or pH buffered water. After 12 weeks of treatment, Apc(min) mice given white tea, green tea, or sulindac had significantly fewer tumors than controls (P < 0.05). The protection provided by 1.5% green or white tea was comparable to that provided by 80 p.p.m. sulindac. Mice treated with a combination of white tea plus sulindac had significantly fewer tumors than either treatment alone (P < 0.05). beta-catenin and beta-catenin/Tcf-4 regulated proteins Cyclin D(1) and c-Jun were readily detected in polyps, but markedly reduced in normal-looking intestines of mice treated with both tea and sulindac. This research provides evidence that teas, particularly when administered in combination with sulindac, are highly effective at inhibiting intestinal neoplasia in male Apc(min) mice via direct or indirect effects on the beta-catenin/APC pathway.
Parzosin, 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, was administered intravenously to anesthetized normal rats. In the dose range 0.001 to 0.01 mg/kg, the drug induced highly significant, dose-related falls in blood pressure, pulse pressure and heart rate. With doses above 0.01 mg/kg, there was a plateau in hypotensive efficacy and a diminution in negative chronotropic activity. Both actions of prazosin (0.01 mg/kg) were unaffected by vagal blockade with atropine, while hypotensive potency was unimpaired after beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. The vasodilator, diazoxide, lowered blood pressure, widened pulse pressure and caused tachycardia in rats pre-treated with pentolinium. In contrast, all effects of prazosin were abolished by ganglion blockade. These findings, together with the absence of compensatory tachycardia or gross renin hypersecretion during prazosin-induced hypotension, are compatible with an antisympathotonic mode of action for the drug. However, consistent with its effects on cyclic nucleotide distribution, prazosin appears to enhance isoprenaline-induced beta-receptor stimulation.
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is an important means for postoperative analgesia with parenteral opioid. However, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains a major problem with a PCA system. Droperidol is used in PCA to prevent PONV. Extrapyramidal reactions by droperidol are, however, occasionally induced. We describe two cases of severe extrapyramidal hypertonic syndrome with an intravenous administration of droperidol in PCA in young patients, following orthopedic surgery.
