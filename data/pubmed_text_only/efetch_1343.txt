Akathisia remains a significant issue even in the era of atypical antipsychotics. The purpose of the present study was to examine the association of akathisia with various domains of subjective tolerability in order to contribute to the renewed interest in akathisia and the subjective experience of antipsychotic treatment. Fifty schizophrenic outpatients receiving stable doses of risperidone were evaluated for akathisia, schizophrenic symptoms, and subjective tolerability. Subjective tolerability was comprehensively assessed using the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale. Analysis of covariance revealed that the akathisia group had a significantly higher total score as well as higher subscale scores of extrapyramidal side effect, psychic side effect, and autonomic side effect on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale. Further analysis using binary logistic regression analysis revealed that these variables were significantly associated with akathisia. The results of our study suggest that akathisia is significantly associated with a wide range of subjective tolerability profiles, implying the necessity to effectively manage akathisia even its mild forms considering its strong association with subjective tolerability in general.
Recent studies suggest that synaptic pathology in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might be caused by the disruption of a signaling pathway at excitatory glutamatergic synapses, which can be influenced by environmental factors. Some factors, such as prenatal zinc deficiency, dysfunction of metallothioneins as well as deletion of COMMD1, all affect brain metal-ion homeostasis and have been associated with ASD. Given that COMMD1 regulates copper levels and that copper and zinc have antagonistic properties, here, we followed the idea that copper overload might induce a local zinc deficiency affecting key players of a putative ASD pathway such as ProSAP/Shank proteins as reported before. Our results show that increased copper levels indeed interfere with intracellular zinc concentrations and affect synaptic ProSAP/Shank levels, which similarly are altered by manipulation of copper and zinc levels through overexpression and knockdown of COMMD1. In line with this, acute and prenatal copper overload lead to local zinc deficiencies in mice. Pups exposed to prenatal copper overload furthermore show a reduction in ProSAP/Shank protein levels in the brain as well as a decreased NMDAR subunit 1 concentration. Thus, it might be likely that brain metal ion status influences a distinct pathway in excitatory synapses associated with genetic forms of ASD.
Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences.
This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic.
All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without.
Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.
Drug dosages, length of stay (LOS), and incidence of psychological side effects of fentanyl and nalbuphine were compared in a randomized, double-blind study using unpremedicated female day-surgery patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy. Patients received either fentanyl 1.5 micrograms/kg (F group; n = 142), low-dose nalbuphine 300 micrograms/kg (LN group; N = 103), or high-dose nalbuphine 500 micrograms/kg (HN group; n = 41), intravenously (IV) before anesthesia consisting of thiopental, N2O, O2, and a succinylcholine infusion. Additional IV intraoperative and IM postoperative opioids were given if required for signs of inadequate anesthesia or postoperative pain. The patients' clinical and psychological status was evaluated at 20-min intervals postoperatively by a team of trained interviewers. The low- and high-dose nalbuphine groups clinically resembled the fentanyl group in terms of dosing frequency and patients' self-ratings of postoperative analgesia. Length of stay and postoperative sedation were significantly greater with nalbuphine. The incidence of psychological side effects, including dreaming and postoperative anxiety, was also greater with nalbuphine. However, patient acceptance of nalbuphine was high and was similar to that observed in patients given fentanyl.
Clinical and biochemical evidence of a rebound phenomenon after discontinuing thrombin inhibitors has been reported in patients with unstable angina. To investigate if a similar phenomenon occurs in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, 14 patients were prospectively studied during and after discontinuation of heparin infusion. A transient thrombotic state identified by a significant increase in a polypeptide fragment and fibrinopeptide A was observed 3 hours after abruptly discontinuing heparin infusion. This observation may be clinically important in managing patients after coronary angioplasty.
A 5-year-old, 29-kg, female Labrador retriever developed tachypnea, tachycardia, and ataxia following ingestion of approximately 48 mg/kg of phenylpropanolamine. Initial diagnostic tests showed multiform ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular dilatation with a focal dyskinetic region in the dorsal interventricular septum, and elevations in creatinine kinase and cardiac troponin I. All abnormalities resolved within 6 months. The transient electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical abnormalities were consistent with myocardial necrosis from infarction or direct catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity.
Adrenomedullin is a potent vasodilator peptide originally isolated from a pheochromocytoma. Recently, a novel adrenomedullin receptor has been identified as a complex of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity modifying protein 2 (RAMP2). To explore the pathophysiological roles of adrenomedullin and its receptor component RAMP2 in ischemic cardiovascular diseases, we studied the changes of adrenomedullin and RAMP2 mRNA in myocardium and aorta in rats with isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial impairment. In ISO-treated rats, heart became enlarged markedly, the ratio of heart to body weight was increased by 54% (P<0.01), and myocardial malondialdehyde content and plasma lactate dehydrogenase activity was elevated by 43% (P<0.01) and 138% (P<0.01), respectively. Immunoreactive adrenomedullin (ADM) in plasma, myocardium and aorta was augmented by 116.7% (P<0.01), 50.8% (P<0.01) and 12.5% (P>0.05), respectively. ADM mRNA in myocardium and aorta was increased by 96.8% (P<0.01) and 38.5% (P<0.01), respectively. RAMP2 mRNA in myocardium and aorta was increased by 19.6% (P<0.05) and 15.8% (P<0.01), respectively. These results suggest that the increase of ADM level and the up-regulation of ADM and RAMP2 gene in myocardium and aorta may be significant in the pathogenesis of ischemic myocardiopathy.
The effects of the morphinan drugs dextrorphan, dextromethorphan and levorphanol were tested towards the cataleptic activity induced by 1 mg/kg of haloperidol i.p. in rats. The influence of the morphinans was compared to that of the N-methyl-D-aspartate competitive antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. 2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (0.5 mumoles, i.c.v.), dextrorphan (7.5-15 mg/kg, i.p.) and dextromethorphan (15-30 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the degree of catalepsy in the haloperidol-treated rats within 15 min. Conversely, levorphanol (15-30 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased the degree of catalepsy in the haloperidol-treated rats within 15 min. Naloxone (2 mg/kg, i.p.) counteracted the potentiating effects of levorphanol. These findings demonstrate a differential influence of the morphinan stereoisomers dextrorphan and levorphanol on experimental catalepsy, and suggest a potential use of dextromethorphan in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Despite structural similarity with prostaglandin F(2 alpha), the ocular hypotensive agent bimatoprost (Lumigan; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA) shows unique pharmacology in vitro and functional activity in vivo. Unfortunately, the precise mechanisms that underlie bimatoprost's distinctive impact on aqueous humor dynamics are unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of bimatoprost and a novel prostamide-selective antagonist AGN 211334 on human conventional drainage.
Two model systems were used to test the consequences of bimatoprost and/or AGN 211334 treatment on conventional drainage. Human anterior segments in organ culture were perfused at a constant flow rate of 2.5 microL/min while pressure was recorded continuously. After stable baseline facilities were established, segments were treated with drug(s), and pressure was monitored for an additional 3 days. In parallel, the drugs' effects on hydraulic conductivity of human trabecular meshwork (TM) cell monolayers were evaluated. Pharmacological properties of AGN 211334 were characterized in isolated feline iris preparations in organ culture and heterologously expressed G-protein-coupled receptors were examined in vitro.
Bimatoprost increased outflow facility by an average of 40% +/- 10% within 48 hours of treatment (n = 10, P < 0.001). Preincubation or coincubation with AGN 211334 significantly blunted bimatoprost's effects by 95% or 43%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in cell culture experiments in which bimatoprost increased hydraulic conductivity of TM cell monolayers by 78% +/- 25%. Pretreatment with AGN 211334 completely blocked bimatoprost's effects, while coincubation decreased its effects on average by 74%. In both models, AGN 211334 alone significantly decreased fluid flux across trabecular tissues and cells.
The findings indicate that bimatoprost interacts with a prostamide receptor in the trabecular meshwork to increase outflow facility.
We report a 12-month-old boy with renal hypouricemia who presented with crying due to obstructing vesicourethral uric acid stones. Metabolic study revealed persistent acidic urine with normal blood pH, and hypouricemia (1.4-1.7 mg/dl) with an increased ratio of uric acid clearance to creatinine clearance (24-32 %). Pyrazinamide produced no response but the patient showed a positive response to benzbromarone. These findings were consistent with a presecretory defect. No other tubular dysfunctions, such as renal glycosuria, aminoaciduria or phosphaturia were found. The patient underwent surgical treatment and was subsequently treated with potassium citrate. After a 2-year follow-up, he remains asymptomatic, despite persistent hyperuricosuria. To our knowledge, this is the youngest reported case of renal hypouricemia and lithiasis.
We report a case of acquired progressive kinking hair, a rare pilar dysplasia. This is the first case induced by sodium valproate.
A 6-year-old girl, treated with valproate, observed a progressive change in the texture of her hair. They were kinky, lusterless, dry and, under light microscopy, exhibited an aspect of pseudo-pili torti.
This child had acquired progressive kinking hair syndrome most likely induced by valproate. Five other cases of valproate-induced pilar dysplasia have been reported but without clinical descriptions.
We propose adding sodium valproate to the list of drugs susceptible of inducing kinky hair syndrome.
Contribution of circadian mechanisms to the psychostimulant-induced behaviors has been suggested. The pineal gland is important component of circadian mechanisms. Using pinealectomized mice and sham-operated controls, we tested the contribution of pineal gland to the rewarding effects of cocaine in conditioned place preference test. Experiments were performed both during the day and at night. Controls with intact pineal glands demonstrated significant decrease in cocaine-induced conditioned place preference at night compared to daytime, whereas pinealectomized mice did not show any diurnal differences. Circadian mechanisms regulated by the pineal gland thus appear critically involved in cocaine-induced reward.
Gonadotropins and sex hormones are intimately related to the stability of affective states. Patients with affective disorders may demonstrate abnormal levels of sex hormones and gonadotropins. It is therefore possible that affective disorder patients may experience mood dysregulation by synthetic sex hormones and gonadotropins like lupron.
A case report of a young woman with a history of endometriosis and a past history of irritability and depression is described. Treatment of the endometriosis with lupron induced a manic episode.
The lupron-induced mania was successfully treated with a mood-stabilizing agent, lithium carbonate.
Patients with a history of affective disorder may develop manic episodes when treated with Lupron. Mood-stabilizing agents are helpful in ameliorating this unwanted effect.
We present an infrequent case of acute hepatitis by indomethacin, in a patient with a primary biliary cirrhosis, previously not diagnosed and asymptomatic, in who during in the follow-up, with a persistent analytical pattern of disociated cholestasis, a liver biopsy was indicated, with the final diagnosis of chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis.
Exposure to aristolochic acid (AA) is associated with human nephropathy and urothelial cancer. Individual susceptibility to AA-induced disease likely reflects individual differences in enzymes that metabolize AA. Herein, we evaluated AAI metabolism by human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and 1A2 in two CYP1A-humanized mouse lines that carry functional human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes in the absence of the mouse Cyp1a1/1a2 orthologs. Human and mouse hepatic microsomes and human CYPs were also studied. Human CYP1A1 and 1A2 were found to be principally responsible for reductive activation of AAI to form AAI-DNA adducts and for oxidative detoxication to 8-hydroxyaristolochic acid (AAIa), both in the intact mouse and in microsomes. Overall, AAI-DNA adduct levels were higher in CYP1A-humanized mice relative to wild-type mice, indicating that expression of human CYP1A1 and 1A2 in mice leads to higher AAI bioactivation than in mice containing the mouse CYP1A1 and 1A2 orthologs. Furthermore, an exclusive role of human CYP1A1 and 1A2 in AAI oxidation to AAIa was observed in human liver microsomes under the aerobic (i.e., oxidative) conditions. Because CYP1A2 levels in human liver are at least 100-fold greater than those of CYP1A1 and there exists a > 60-fold genetic variation in CYP1A2 levels in human populations, the role of CYP1A2 in AAI metabolism is clinically relevant. The results suggest that, in addition to CYP1A1 and 1A2 expression levels, in vivo oxygen concentration in specific tissues might affect the balance between AAI nitroreduction and demethylation, which in turn would influence tissue-specific toxicity or carcinogenicity.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of botulinum toxin type A on bladder function and histology in a rat chemical cystitis model. The study included 41 female Sprague-Dawley rats with chemical cystitis induced by intravesical instillation of hydrochloric acid. The acid instillation was repeated monthly to maintain chronic inflammation. The treatment group (n=21) received 2-3 units of botulinum toxin type A injected into the bladder detrusor at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 o'clock positions, and the control group (n=20) underwent saline injection into the bladder detrusor at the same positions. Urodynamic studies were performed in all rats before the treatment and at death. The rats were killed at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 2 months after treatment. The bladders were removed and examined histologically for mast cells and inflammatory changes. The cystometric findings showed that, at the beginning and end of the experiment, the increases in the maximum bladder capacity and compliance were significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group (P=0.000 and P=0.025, respectively). The histological studies revealed similar mast cell counts and leukocyte infiltration for the treatment and control groups. In conclusion, in this rat chemical cystitis model, botulinum toxin type A injected into the bladder detrusor led to a functional improvement. Thus, botulinum toxin type A injection may be an alternative, minimally invasive choice to other surgical treatment options in the treatment of a chronic inflammatory condition to improve deteriorated bladder function.
Effects of the brominated flame retardants (BFRs), decabrominated diphenyl ether (DBDE), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), on host immunity of mice were evaluated using respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Five-week-old female mice were fed a diet containing 1% BFRs for 28days, and subsequently infected with RSV. No toxicological sign was observed in BFR-treated mice before infection. TBBPA significantly increased the pulmonary viral titer in the infected mice on day 5 post-infection, but DBDE and HBCD did not. Slight histological changes were observed in lung tissues of TBBPA-treated mice with mock infection. These changes due to TBBPA were much exacerbated by RSV infection. Cytokine analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from RSV-infected mice treated with or without TBBPA revealed that TBBPA significantly increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-gamma at each time point after virus infection, but no change was observed for IL-1beta and IL-12. The levels of IL-4 and IL-10, Th2 cytokines, significantly decreased. Thus, TBBPA caused unusual production of the various cytokines in RSV-infected mice. Flow cytometry revealed that the percentage of double-positive CD4+CD8+ cells, immature T lymphocytes, in the cell populations in BALF from RSV-infected mice increased due to TBBPA treatment. The change was not observed in spleen cells of TBBPA-treated mice. The response to RSV infection verified that TBBPA treatment affected the host immunity of mice. Irregular changes in cytokine production and immune cell populations due to TBBPA treatment were suggested to cause exacerbation of pneumonia in RSV-infected mice.
Clobazam, an anxiolytic 1,5-benzodiazepine, has been evaluated as an anticonvulsant in 2 animal models. In mice showing sound induced seizures, clobazam, 1--4 mg/kg, i.p., blocked seizure responses for 1--2 hr. In Senegalese baboons Papio papio showing photically induced myoclonus or seizures, clobazam, 2--12 mg/kg, i.v., totally prevented such responses for up to 6 hr. In baboons pretreated with allylglycine, 170--185 mg/kg, a similar but briefer protection was induced by clobazam. Neurological toxicity was not prominent (transient, slight nystagmus after clobazam, 2--6 mg/kg; muscular hypotonia after clobazam, 12 mg/kg). The possibility that 1,5-benzodiazepines are superior to 1,4-benzodiazepines in the therapy of epilepsy requires clinical investigation.
Since beta 2-receptor agonists and corticosteroids can counteract inflammatory mediator induced protein leakage and corticosteroids have been proposed as effective in treatment of experimental septic shock, we compared the effects of these agents on rats in endotoxin shock. Sixty adult wistar rats were anaesthetised with thiopentone sodium intra-peritoneally (i.p.), before shock was induced by E coli endotoxin (3 mg/kg bwt i.v.). Ten minutes later the rats were divided into four groups (n = 15 in each) and received either normal saline (controls) 4 ml/kg i.p., methyl prednisolone (MP) 40 mg/kg i.p., isoprenaline (ISO) 200 micrograms/kg i.p. or terbutaline (TER) 200 micrograms/kg i.p. 25% of the initial dose was repeated after 15, 60 and 120 minutes. After 2 hours observation 3-5 animals had died in each group (n.s.), but at the end of the observation period (96 hrs), 87% of the controls, 73% of the MP-group, 53% of the ISO-group and 20% of the TER-group had died. At this time all the surviving animals were looking well and behaving normally. It was concluded that terbutaline significantly increased the survival of rats exposed to a lethal dose of endotoxin compared with controls (p less than 0.001) and compared with methyl prednisolon (p less than 0.05). The mechanism may be that of decreased pulmonary capillary leakage with terbutaline. However, the survival rate was not significantly improved with methyl prednisolon or isoprenaline.
We describe six patients with invasive fungal infections who received large cumulative doses (22.3-73.6 g) of amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) over 21-121 weeks. The drug was well tolerated at these very large doses, and there was limited toxicity. Collectively, these patients received ABLC therapy for a mean of 53.8 weeks (range, 21-121 weeks). The mean serum creatinine level at the start of ABLC therapy was 1 mg/dL (range, 0.4-1.9 mg/dL), and at the end of therapy this level was 1.5 mg/dL (range, 1.0-2.0 mg/dL). Over the course of therapy, only two patients had serum creatinine levels of > or = 2 mg/dL, with transient peak serum creatinine levels of 3.5 and 2.8 mg/dL, respectively. Several patients required replacement therapy with oral or intravenous potassium. None of the patients had ABLC-associated toxic effects necessitating discontinuation of the treatment. ABLC may be given in substantially larger doses than conventional amphotericin B, and very high doses of ABLC that are administered over several months appear to be relatively less toxic than those of conventional amphotericin B.
Amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCD), a novel formulation of amphotericin B and cholesteryl sulfate in a 1:1 ratio, was developed to reduce the toxicity of amphotericin B yet retain its antifungal efficacy. In an open-label trial, ABCD at dosages as high as 6 mg/(kg.d) was administered to 168 patients with documented or presumed systemic mycoses. All patients had responded incompletely to at least 7 days' treatment with conventional amphotericin B (CAB), had experienced CAB-induced nephrotoxic effects, had preexisting renal impairment, or had experienced other CAB-related, treatment-limiting toxic effects. The clinical response to ABCD could be evaluated in 97 patients. Complete clinical response or improvement was noted in 48 (49%) of them after a mean treatment duration of 18.5 days. All 168 enrolled patients were evaluated with regard to safety of the treatment. Even at daily doses as high as 6 mg/kg, and mean and median cumulative doses of 4.0 g and 2.4 g, respectively, ABCD had little renal toxicity: the mean change in serum level of creatinine from baseline to final value was -0.02 mg/dL. Hypokalemia developed in eight patients (5%). This study provides preliminary evidence that ABCD is effective in treating invasive mycoses and lacks the dose-limiting nephrotoxicity of CAB.
To examine the effect of 17beta-estradiol on the severity of the cardinal signs of PD in postmenopausal women.
Although the impact of estrogens on the manifestations of PD has not been subjected to rigorous study, their use is generally thought to be associated with a detrimental antidopaminergic effect.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm crossover study of high-dose transdermal 17beta-estradiol was conducted in eight postmenopausal women with mild to moderate PD, all but one of whom exhibited levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Patients were randomized initially to either hormonal treatment or placebo for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period, and then another 2-week crossover treatment period. Active treatment employed four skin patches each releasing 0.1 mg of estradiol daily, replaced every 2 to 3 days.
After 10 days of treatment a significant reduction was observed in the antiparkinsonian threshold dose of IV levodopa. Mean duration and magnitude of the antiparkinsonian response to threshold or high doses of levodopa were unchanged, and dyskinesia scores were unaltered during 17beta-estradiol treatment compared with placebo. No worsening in "on" time or motor ratings with estrogen treatment was documented.
17beta-estradiol appears to display a slight prodopaminergic (or antiparkinsonian) effect without consistently altering dyskinesias. Standard postmenopausal replacement therapy with transdermal 17beta-estradiol is likely to be well tolerated by many female parkinsonian patients.
Diabetes mellitus is associated with altered iron homeostasis that can potentially effect reactive oxygen species generation and contribute to diabetes-related complications. We investigated, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, whether the expression of liver hepcidin, ferritin, and TfR-1 is altered in diabetes. Rats in the control (C) group received a standard diet; control iron (CI) group received a standard diet supplemented with iron; diabetic (D) group received an injection of streptozotocin; and diabetic iron (DI) group received streptozotocin and the diet with iron. Animals of the D group showed higher levels of serum iron, increased concentration of carbonyl protein, and a decrease in antioxidant status. Group D rats showed increased hepatic expression of Trf-1 compared to the other groups. Iron supplementation reversed this increase. Hepcidin mRNA was 81% higher in DI than in C and CI rats. The results suggest that diabetes, with or without excess iron, can cause perturbations in iron status, hepcidin and Trf-1 expression.
Among the micronutrients required by humans, zinc has particularly divergent modes of action. cDNA microarray and quantitative PCR technologies were used to investigate the zinc responsiveness of known genes that influence zinc homeostasis and to identify, through global screening, genes that may relate to phenotypic outcomes of altered dietary zinc intake. Human monocytic/macrophage THP-1 cells were either acutely zinc depleted, using a cell-permeable zinc-specific chelator, or were supplemented with zinc to alter intracellular zinc concentrations. Initially, genes associated with zinc homeostasis were evaluated by quantitative PCR to establish ranges for fold changes in transcript abundance that might be expected with global screening. Zinc transporter-1 and zinc transporter-7 expression increased when cellular zinc increased, whereas Zip-2 expression, the most zinc-responsive gene examined, was markedly increased by zinc depletion. Microarrays composed of approximately 22,000 elements were used to identify those genes responsive to either zinc depletion, zinc supplementation, or both conditions. Hierarchal clustering and ANOVA revealed that approximately 5% or 1,045 genes were zinc responsive. Further sorting based on this pattern of the zinc responsiveness of these genes into seven groups revealed that 104 genes were linearly zinc responsive in a positive mode (i.e., increased expression as cellular zinc increases) and 86 genes that were linearly zinc responsive in a negative mode (i.e., decreased expression as cellular zinc increases). Expression of some genes was responsive to only zinc depletion or supplementation. Categorization by function revealed numerous genes needed for host defense were among those identified as zinc responsive, including cytokine receptors and genes associated with amplification of the Th1 immune response.
This article reports on a case of sensorimotor neuropathy in a 55-year-old man that developed after vincristine therapy. Subsequent biopsy of the sural nerve and electromyographic studies revealed the presence of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Only 17 patients who developed severe neuropathy with very low accumulated doses of vincristine have been described in the literature. Pain and lateral ankle instability were treated with a functional orthosis. Orthopedic treatment and the biomechanical basis of foot and ankle problems in patients with vincristine therapy-induced Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are discussed.
Irradiated tumor cells given, together with indomethacin, to syngeneic mice induced an antitumor response and conferred protection against a challenge of a lethal dose of murine mammary (4T1) and lung (3LL) carcinoma cells. Continuous administration of indomethacin was crucial throughout the entire period of immunization and challenge, as no protection was achieved when the drug was given during only one of these procedures. Antitumor immunity was long-lasting and, when tested in the 4T1 model, 48% of mice were resistant to a second challenge of lethal tumor cells. Tumor-free immune mice that were given indomethacin for more than 300 days remained healthy with normal white blood cell counts and normal spleen size. Cells isolated from immune mice were able to kill tumor cells in culture after in vitro activation by interleukin-2, in a manner similar to cells from naive normal control mice. In addition, the mitogenic response of their T cells was as high as that of the control naive mice. While indomethacin was able to induce antitumor immunity to 4T1 and 3LL murine carcinoma cells, both of which contain a high concentration of endogenic prostaglandin E(2) (PGE2), no such immunity was achieved to murine tumor cells with a low concentration of endogenic PGE2. These results suggest a correlation between PGE2 concentration and the ability of indomethacin to induce antitumor immunity. We therefore suggest that an immunotherapy protocol with long-term dispensation of a tolerable dose of an immunomodulator, given together with irradiated autologous tumor cells, may stimulate antitumor responses to tumors containing high concentrations of endogenic PGE2.
