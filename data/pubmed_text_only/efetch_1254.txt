Contrast media occasionally produce ventricular fibrillation during coronary angiography. We compared the fibrillatory propensity of the conventional ionic contrast medium, Hypaque-76 (H76) to the low osmolar ionic dimer Hexabrix (HB) and to the nonionic agent Omnipaque (OM) in 20 open chest anesthetized dogs. Intracoronary injection of 6 mL of contrast medium produced spontaneous ventricular fibrillation in four of ten dogs with H76, compared with two of ten with HB, and zero of ten with OM (P = .07). The induction of two premature beats by programmed stimulation of the myocardium during injection of 4 mL of contrast medium produced ventricular fibrillation in ten of ten dogs with H76, compared with three of ten with HB, and zero of ten with OM (P less than .001). Both H76 and HB produced ventricular fibrillation in ten of ten dogs when three premature beats were induced, compared with two of ten dogs with OM (P less than .001). Four mL H76 produced a 109 +/- 18 msec increase in the QT interval, compared with an 82 +/- 17 msec increase with HB, and a 45 +/- 12 msec increase with OM. We conclude that both low osmolar HB and OM are less fibrillatory than the conventional ionic medium H76, and that the nonionic medium OM is less fibrillatory than the ionic dimer contrast medium HB.
Alcoholic fatty liver is susceptible to secondary stresses such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Baicalin is an active component extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis, which is widely used in herbal preparations for treatment of hepatic diseases and inflammatory disorders. This study evaluated the potential beneficial effect of baicalin on I/R injury in alcoholic fatty liver. Rats were fed an alcohol liquid diet or a control isocaloric diet for 5 weeks, and then subjected to 60 min of hepatic ischemia and 5h of reperfusion. Baicalin (200mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered 24 and 1h before ischemia. After reperfusion, baicalin attenuated the increases in serum alanine aminotransferase activity, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in alcoholic fatty liver. The increased levels of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression and inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA expressions increased after reperfusion, which were higher in ethanol-fed animals, were attenuated by baicalin. In ethanol-fed animals, baicalin attenuated the increases in toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 protein expressions and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB after reperfusion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that baicalin ameliorates I/R-induced hepatocellular damage by suppressing TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses in alcoholic fatty liver.
Therapeutic options for patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) now include the purine nucleoside analogues, fludarabine and cladribine. Both these agents have been associated with the onset of severe life-threatening autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In these reports, AIHA developed within 6 weeks of drug administration and was generally resistant to conventional therapy. AIHA following purine analogues has not been reported in other hematologic malignancies. We report here on 4 patients with WM who developed AIHA following cladribine therapy. Cladribine was administered as a 2-hour infusion at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg per day for 5 consecutive days, at 28-day intervals. The median number of cycles was four (range, 4 to 6). AIHA occurred at a median of 40 months (range, 24 to 60) from cladribine administration. Only 1 patient responded to oral steroids while the other 3 were resistant to multiple therapeutic interventions. Two patients, 1 in complete remission and 1 requiring transfusional support, remain alive, and 2 have died. In contrast to published reports of the early onset of AIHA occurring after purine analogues in CLL patients, we observed AIHA in WM patients as a delayed event.
Gossypol prevents the liberation of oxygen from oxyhemoglobin and exerts a hemolytic effect on erythrocytes. In excessive dosages of gossypol, an extreme burden is placed upon the respiratory and circulatory organs owing to the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of blood. Chromium protoporphyrin (CrPP) has been shown to either competitively suppress or to significantly ameliorate a variety of naturally occurring or experimentally induced forms of jaundice in animals and man. In this communication, a novel tissue dependent response to gossypol (50 micromol/kg bw) and gossypol in association with CrPP (50 micromol/kg bw) is described. Our results revealed that gossypol stimulated the hepatic, splenic, and renal delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALA-S) activity, the heme biosynthetic enzyme, and simultaneous administration of CrPP and gossypol synergized the gossypol-mediated increase of ALA-S activity. Gossypol was found to be a potent stimulator of heme oxygenase (HMOX) activity in rat liver and kidney to varying degrees. This tissue response contrasted with that of the spleen, where gossypol decreased the activity of the enzyme. In consonance with the increased hepatic and renal HMOX activity, a marked increase was observed in total serum bilirubin concentration in gossypol treated rats. When rats were given CrPP simultaneously with gossypol, the gossypol mediated increase in hepatic and renal HMOX activity was effectively blocked. Furthermore, the increase in enzymatic activity was accomplished by a decline in the total microsomal protein content on gossypol administration. These findings emphasize the toxic effect of gossypol in eliciting increased heme degradation by stimulating HMOX activity in the liver and the kidney and the potential usefulness of CrPP in experimental and perhaps clinical conditions in which hyperbilirubinemia occurs.
We have previously reported that hepatocarcinogens increase liver cells expressing p21(Cip1), a G1 checkpoint protein and M phase proteins after 28-day treatment in rats. This study aimed to identify early prediction markers of carcinogens available in many target organs after 28-day treatment in rats. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on Ki-67, p21(Cip1) and M phase proteins [nuclear Cdc2, phospho-Histone H3 (p-Histone H3), Aurora B and heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α)] with carcinogens targeting different organs. Carcinogens targeting thyroid (sulfadimethoxine; SDM), urinary bladder (phenylethyl isothiocyanate), forestomach (butylated hydroxyanisole; BHA), glandular stomach (catechol; CC), and colon (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine and chenodeoxycholic acid) were examined using a non-carcinogenic toxicant (caprolactam) and carcinogens targeting other organs as negative controls. All carcinogens increased Ki-67(+), nuclear Cdc2(+), p-Histone H3(+) or Aurora B(+) carcinogenic target cells, except for both colon carcinogens, which did not increase cell proliferation. On the other hand, p21(Cip1+) cells increased with SDM and CC. HP1α responded only to BHA. Results revealed carcinogens evoking cell proliferation concurrently induced cell cycle arrest at M phase or showing chromosomal instability reflecting aberration in cell cycle regulation, irrespective of target organs, after 28-day treatment. Therefore, M phase proteins may be early prediction markers of carcinogens evoking cell proliferation in many target organs.
Various aspects of the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties of the RXR receptor agonist Targretin (LGD 1069) were examined in the methylnitrosourea (MNU)-induced model of mammary cancer. The administration of Targretin at dose levels of 60, 20 or 6.7 mg/kg body wt/day by gavage decreased the number of mammary tumors by 96, 85 and 78%, respectively. When Targretin was administered in the diet at 92 and 275 mg/kg diet cancer multiplicities were reduced by 78 and 92%, respectively. A wider range of dietary doses of Targretin at 15, 50 and 150 mg/kg diet reduced the number of mammary tumors by 38, 55 and 70%, respectively. Treatment of rats with different regimens of Targretin (250 mg/kg diet) yielded cancer multiplicities of 4.3 for non-treated rats, 0.5 for rats treated continuously with Targretin, 2.1 for rats treated with Targretin for 8 weeks followed by 10 weeks of the control diet and 1.6 for rats treated with Targretin alternating 3 days on and 4 days off. Targretin was also examined as a therapeutic agent by treating rats with at least one palpable mammary tumor for 5 weeks. A high dose of Targretin (272 mg/kg diet) caused partial or complete regression of approximately 65% of the cancers over this time period. In contrast, in animals treated with 15 mg Targretin/kg diet only 1 of 12 cancers showed significant regression. Finally, the effect of a limited exposure to Targretin (7 days) on cell proliferation and apoptosis in small mammary tumors was determined. Targretin at 150 mg/kg diet strongly decreased proliferation (75%) and increased apoptosis (300%), while a lower dose of Targretin (15 mg/kg diet, which still prevented 30% of cancers) had no effect on apoptosis but did decrease cell proliferation. Determination of serum IGF1 levels showed that treatment of rats with highly effective doses of Targretin at 272 mg/kg diet or at 60 or 20 mg/kg body wt/day by gavage caused significantly decreased serum IGF1 levels.
This case report describes a post-coronary artery bypass graft patient who developed arterial thrombosis and loss of a dominant hand as a result of the common and serious immune complication of heparin anticoagulation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. This report underscores the need for all surgeons who use heparin in the course of their practice to be aware of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and the spectrum of its clinical presentations and management. Thrombocytopenia or thrombosis that occurs in a patient receiving heparin should prompt a surgeon to stop all heparin as soon as possible and seek appropriate hematologic consultation. Because heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are mainly clinical diagnoses, one should not wait for objective test confirmation of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia before stopping all heparin treatment. Alternative anticoagulation, other than low molecular weight heparin, must be considered for the patient who develops either condition. For surgeons who perform hand surgery, it is necessary to be aware of the significance of upper extremity thrombosis in a patient who is receiving heparin when consulted for surgical management.
Arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis was identified by morphological change and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in hematopoietic malignant cells and neuroblastoma cells. Arsenic trioxide directly induced apoptosis in the acute promyelocytic cell line NB4 cells at a low dose of 1 microM, whereas all-trans-retinoic acid caused the cells to differentiate and finally induced apoptosis. In addition to the involvement of caspase 3 in arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells, the activation of caspase 8 was also shown to be involved by Western blot analysis or by apoptosis inhibition assay using caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO. The down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein was shown in arsenic trioxide-treated pre-apoptotic and early apoptotic mouse B-cell line LyH7 cells, which overexpress Bcl-2 protein, by the studies of Western blot and immunoelectron microscopy. Arsenic trioxide also induced apoptosis in the majority of neuroblastomas cell lines. The arsenic-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines was mediated by the activation of caspase 3 in all cases tested. In regard to the intracellular content of reduced glutathione in various neuroblastoma cell lines, the level in the cells sensitive to arsenic trioxide was under 40 nmol/mg protein, but the cells having more than 40 nmol/mg protein did not undergo apoptosis. N-acetylcysteine protected neuroblastoma cells from arsenic-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the intracellular glutathione content may be a good indicator of application of arsenic trioxide for various kinds of cancer cells. Our results raise the possibility that arsenic trioxide will be effective even against a solid tumor such as neuroblastoma and warrants clinical trials for patients with other kinds of tumors not only by systemic therapy but also using local therapy.
In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the arrhythmogenic action of chlorpromazine (CPZ). Thirty-two anesthetized mongrel dogs were used. In each, the chest was opened and a stimulating electrode was attached to the apex of the left ventricle and the ventricular multiple response threshold (VMRT) was measured. The carotid artery was cannulated to measure aortic pressure. The dogs were divided into four groups, and the time course of VMRT, blood pressure, and heart rate were determined. All groups were placed under observation for 30 min after CPZ infusion. In the control group, only saline (2ml/kg) was infused; CPZ group: CPZ (Img/kg) was infused 10 min after saline (2ml/kg) infusion; CoQ10 group: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (5mg/kg) was infused 10 min before CPZ (Img/kg) infusion; FAD group: Flavin-adenine-dinucleotide (FAD) (2mg/kg) was infused 10 min before CPZ (Img/kg) infusion. In each group, myocardial mitochondria were prepared 30 min after CPZ infusion. The mitochondrial functions, respiratory control index, AdP/O, State III rate of oxygen consumption, and activities of two segments of the electron-transport chain (NADH leads to CoQ leads to cyt.c and cyt.c leads to cyt.a,a3 leads to O2) were measured separately. Ca++--binding activity of the mitochondria was also determined. CPZ administration decreased VMRT and blood pressure, and caused mitochondrial dysfunction which derived from a disturbance in the first segment of the electron transport chain. Decreased Ca++--binding activity was observed when mitochondrial function was disturbed. CoQ10 prevented significantly the decrease in VMRT and the disturbance of mitochondrial function induced by CPZ, but did not prevent the hypotensive effect of CPZ. FAD prevented not only the decrease in VMRT and the disturbance of mitochondrial function, but also the hypotensive effect of CPZ. These results suggest that the decrease in VMRT is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction induced by CPZ. Moreover, it is suggested that the arrhythmogenic effect of CPZ is derived from the decreased mitochondrial Ca++--binding activity.
Both beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist drugs (beta-blockers) and non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs), ie, diltiazem and verapamil, can cause sinus arrest or severe sinus bradycardia, and when drugs from the two classes are used together, these effects may be more than additive. We report nine patients in whom a beta-blocker (one patient), a non-DHP CCB (one patient), or the combination (seven patients) caused sinus arrest or severe sinus bradycardia which resulted in hospitalization in six of the nine. Although this combination of drugs always has the potential for causing profound bradycardia, certain aspects of the history, such as age, the presence of renal or hepatic disease, and the number and types of other medications, are further predictors of marked bradycardia with hypotension.
Four hapten-carrier conjugates were synthesized to evaluate any potential antigenic similarities between these synthetic compounds and the immunogens induced in vivo by the anesthetic, halothane and, thus, be used eventually as a more sensitive probe to detect the presence of these halothane-induced antibodies in halothane-exposed individuals. In this study, antibodies from five halothane hepatitis patients were used to evaluate these antigenic alterations since the specificity of these antibodies would most accurately reflect the antigenic structure of halothane-induced immunogens. Quantitation of antibody binding to these synthetic proteins was determined in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot techniques. Trifluoroacetylated rabbit serum albumin was 5 times more reactive with these antibodies and thus more antigenic than the homologous acetylated moiety confirming the importance of the trifluoromethyl moiety as an epitope in the immunogen in vivo. Insertion of a spacer arm, aminocaproic acid, between the hapten and carrier moieties and an epitope density of 40% acetylation also increased antigenicity. Through these structural alterations produced in vitro, antigenic compounds have been produced which may resemble more closely the immunogen elicited in vivo and which may ultimately serve as more sensitive probes for halothane-induced antibodies from exposed individuals.
Myocardial infarction is one of the most common manifestations of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of betaine, a potent lipotropic molecule, on changes in the levels of lysosomal enzymes and lipid peroxidation in isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction in Wistar rats, an animal model of myocardial infarction in man. Male albino Wistar rats were pretreated with betaine (250 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 30 days. After the treatment period, isoprenaline (11 mg/100 g body weight) was intraperitoneally administered to rats at intervals of 24 h for 2 days. The activities of lysosomal enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, and acid phosphatase) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in plasma with a concomitant decline in the activities of these enzymes in heart tissue of isoprenaline-administered rats. Also, the level of lipid peroxidation was higher in heart lysosomes of isoprenaline-injected rats. Pretreatment with betaine daily for a period of 30 days to isoprenaline-induced rats prevented the changes in the activities of these lysosomal enzymes. Oral treatment with betaine (250 mg/kg body weight) to normal control rats did not show any significant effect in all the biochemical parameters studied. Thus, the results of our study show that betaine protects the lysosomal membrane against isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction. The observed effects might be due to the free radical-scavenging and membrane-stabilizing properties of betaine.
Previous studies showed that Pien Tze Huang, a Chinese folk medicine well known for its therapeutic activity in treating liver diseases, protected the liver against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced damage in mice. In the present study, natural musk, one of the important ingredients of Pien Tze Huang, was replaced by a formulated substitute, and the new formulation of Pien Tze Huang was shown to have similar chromatographic patterns to the original Pien Tze Huang in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography. When used in treating mice with CCl4- or galactosamine-induced liver damage, both the original and new formulations of Pien Tze Huang were found to be able to suppress to a similar extent both the histopathological changes in the liver and the elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Necrosis, cellular ballooning, microvesicular steatosis and lymphocytes infiltration were all significantly reduced in the damaged liver. In hepatoma cells, both formulations activated the activator protein 1 (AP1) enhancer sequence, indicating that both of them were able to act through the JNK signal transduction pathway. The results of the present study showed that the substitution for natural musk does not affect the hepatoprotective activities of Pien Tze Huang. It is also postulated that both formulations protect the liver through regulating signal transduction in the cell.
Proteinuria is an increasingly recognized effect of sirolimus (SRL) therapy in kidney transplant recipients. Predictors of proteinuria after conversion to SRL are not well described, and in particular the risk in African-American (AA) kidney recipients is unknown. We sought to analyze risk factors for proteinuria with SRL therapy in a cohort of 39 patients (44% AA) converted from tacrolimus to SRL at a mean time of 4 months posttransplantation. Patients were maintained on therapy with mycophenolate mofetil while most patients underwent early steroid withdrawal. Urinary protein to creatinine ratio (Up/cr) at a mean of 14 months postconversion increased to > or =500 mg/g in 65% of AAs versus 14% of non-AAs (p = 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure at the time of conversion and pretransplant proteinuric kidney disease were also predictors of proteinuria after SRL conversion. In conclusion, AAs appear to be at high risk for proteinuria and should be monitored closely after conversion to SRL in calcineurin inhibitor sparing protocols.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the neurotoxic peptide beta-amyloid, which is produced by proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a large membrane-bound copper-binding protein that is essential in maintaining synaptic function and may play a role in synaptogenesis. beta-Amyloid has been shown to contribute to the oxidative stress that accompanies AD. Later stages of AD are characterized by neuronal apoptosis. However, the biochemical function of APP and the mechanism of the toxicity of beta-amyloid are still unclear. In this study, we show that both beta-amyloid and APP can oxidize cholesterol to form 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, a proapoptotic oxysterol that was neurotoxic at nanomolar concentrations. 7beta-Hydroxycholesterol inhibited secretion of soluble APP from cultured rat hippocampal H19-7/IGF-IR neuronal cells and inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme alpha-secretase activity but had no effect on beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 activity. 7beta-Hydroxycholesterol was also a potent inhibitor of alpha-protein kinase C, with a K(i) of approximately 0.2 nm. The rate of reaction between cholesterol and beta-amyloid was comparable to the rates of cholesterol-metabolizing enzymes (k(cat) = 0.211 min(-)1). The rate of production of 7beta-hydroxycholesterol by APP was approximately 200 times lower than by beta-amyloid. Oxidation of cholesterol was accompanied by stoichiometric production of hydrogen peroxide and required divalent copper. The results suggest that a function of APP may be to produce low levels of 7-hydroxycholesterol. Higher levels produced by beta-amyloid could contribute to the oxidative stress and cell loss observed in Alzheimer's disease.
Recent studies confirmed a high incidence of sensory axonal neuropathy in patients treated with different doses of thalidomide. The study's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude in patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) treated with thalidomide and use these findings to identify the neurotoxic potential of thalidomide and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment.
Clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with CLE during treatment with thalidomide and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed. Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction > or =40% was the criteria for discontinuing therapy.
During treatment, 11 patients showed a reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude compared to baseline values (9 with a reduction > or =50% and 2 <50%). One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude. Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps. After thalidomide treatment, sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients. At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude, the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21.4 g. The threshold neurotoxic dosage is lower than previously reported.
Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres. This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical neurotoxic potential of thalidomide but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms.
Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has a range of adverse health effects, but its association with dementia remains unclear and with dementia syndromes unknown. We examined the dose-response relationship between ETS exposure and dementia syndromes.
Using a standard method of GMS, we interviewed 5921 people aged ≥60 years in five provinces in China in 2007-2009 and characterised their ETS exposure. Five levels of dementia syndrome were diagnosed using the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy instrument. The relative risk (RR) of moderate (levels 1-2) and severe (levels 3-5) dementia syndromes among participants exposed to ETS was calculated in multivariate adjusted regression models.
626 participants (10.6%) had severe dementia syndromes and 869 (14.7%) moderate syndromes. Participants exposed to ETS had a significantly increased risk of severe syndromes (adjusted RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.59). This was dose-dependently related to exposure level and duration. The cumulative exposure dose data showed an adjusted RR of 0.99 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.28) for >0-24 level years of exposure, 1.15 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.42) for 25-49 level years, 1.18 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.59) for 59-74 level years, 1.39 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.84) for 75-99 level years and 1.95 (95% CI 1.34 to 2.83) for ≥100 level years. Significant associations with severe syndromes were found in never smokers and in former/current smokers. There were no positive associations between ETS and moderate dementia syndromes.
ETS should be considered an important risk factor for severe dementia syndromes. Avoidance of ETS may reduce the rates of severe dementia syndromes worldwide.
Neuroprotection has been the focus of several current efforts to develop a strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The B-type monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) inhibitor deprenyl (selegiline) is used clinically as a PD therapeutic agent, however, its cytoprotective mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we show that deprenyl upregulates the expression and activity of NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), attenuates the increase in the quinoprotein levels in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-treated PC12 cells, and protects PC12 cells from oxidative damage. Deprenyl triggers the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway by increasing the nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity of Nrf2. Both the antioxidant activity of deprenyl and its effect on NQO1 upregulation were greatly attenuated in Nrf2 siRNA transfected cells. The phosphorylation of extracellular regulating protein kinase (Erk) and Akt can be induced by the administration of 50μM deprenyl in PC12 cells, and the ability of deprenyl to enhance NQO1 expression and Nrf2 nuclear translocation is partly attenuated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 and is almost completely attenuated by the phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. The activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling by deprenyl in PC12 cells is independent of MAO-B inhibition. Altogether, our findings indicate that deprenyl protects PC12 cells exposed to MPP(+) resulting from oxidative stress via the Nrf2-mediated upregulation of NQO1 involving both the PI3K/Akt and Erk pathways.
It has been reported that the adenine nucleoside analogue fludarabine is able to increase the phosphorylation and the cytotoxicity of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) in different leukemic models, both in vitro and in vivo. In poor prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the combination of fludarabine with Ara-C and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has proven to be a highly effective regimen. In this study we aimed to further investigate the effects of this drug combination. In vitro, on fresh AML cells from ten patients, our results confirm an additive cytotoxic effect displayed by fludarabine + Ara-C, as demonstrated by isobologram analysis of the data. The addition of G-CSF significantly increased the efficacy of the drug combination. These effects appeared to be related to an increased incorporation of [3H]Ara-C into cellular DNA in the presence of fludarabine + G-CSF. Furthermore, the quantitative evaluation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) showed that fludarabine + Ara-C + G-CSF induce apoptosis to a higher degree than either compound alone. This finding suggests that cooperative induction of apoptosis could be the potential mechanism of action of this drug combination.
An 85-year-old lady with a 4-year history of Alzheimer's dementia was started on a dose of 5 mg of Donepezil. Improvements were noted in her overall mental state with an associated reduction in the level of carer stress but with mild and transient subjective gastrointestinal complaints. Therefore, the dose was cautiously increased to 10 mg. But within 10 days of the increase, she reported bilateral leg pain severe enough to cause her mental state to deteriorate significantly. Pain induced by Donepezil undermined the efficacy of the drug, resulted in increased carer stress and worsening cognition not reversed by the change of medication to another cholinesterase inhibitor.
Octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, has demonstrated clinical utility in patients with carcinoid syndrome and malignant islet cell tumors of the pancreas. Prior studies have reported a greater than expected incidence of cholelithiasis in patients treated with octreotide for acromegaly. This study attempted to determine the incidence and morbidity of cholelithiasis in a group of patients with metastatic carcinoid or malignant pancreatic islet cell tumors who were receiving chronic therapy with octreotide.
Forty-four of 55 patients on investigational protocols with octreotide were eligible for chart review; 10 patients were excluded due to prior cholecystectomy and 1 patient due to asymptomatic cholelithiasis at presentation. Patients fell into three treatment groups. The low dose (LD) group was comprised of 17 patients receiving 150 microg of subcutaneous octreotide 3 times a day. Twenty-one patients received high dose (HD) therapy comprised of 500 microg given 3 times a day. The low dose-high dose (LD-HD) group was comprised of 6 patients who had their dose escalated from 150 microg to 225-500 microg of octreotide 3 times a day.
The overall incidence of cholelithiasis and/or gallbladder sludge was found to be 52.3% in all 3 treatment groups. Three of the 44 patients (6.8%) had symptomatic disease requiring emergency cholecystectomy. Five other patients underwent elective or incidental gallbladder surgery. The incidence of cholelithiasis in the LD, LD-HD, and HD groups was 35.3%, 66.6%, and 61.9%, respectively. The incidence of acute cholecystitis in the three groups was 11.8%, 0%, and 4.8%, respectively.
Although greater than 50% of patients receiving octreotide developed cholelithiasis, a much smaller percentage of patients had symptomatic gallbladder disease. Patients receiving chronic octreotide treatment require monitoring for the development of gallstones. However, prophylactic cholecystectomy is not indicated, unless it is performed in conjunction with bowel resection or cytoreductive hepatic surgery.
Alpha-1-antitrypsin (a1AT) deficiency is caused by homozygosity for the a1AT mutant Z gene and occurs in one in 2000 Americans. The Z mutation confers an abnormal conformation on the a1AT mutant Z protein, resulting in accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and chronic liver injury. Autophagy is one of several proteolytic mechanisms activated to cope with this hepatocellular protein burden, and is likely important in disposal of the unique polymerized conformation of the a1AT mutant Z protein, which is thought to be especially injurious to the cell. Recent data indicate that rapamycin may more efficiently upregulate autophagy when given in weekly dose pulses, as compared with a daily regimen. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of rapamycin on PiZ mice, a well-characterized model which recapitulates human a1AT liver disease. Daily dosing had no effect on autophagy, on accumulation of a1AT mutant Z protein or on liver injury. Weekly dosing of rapamycin did increase autophagic activity, as shown by increased numbers of autophagic vacuoles. This was associated with reduction in the intrahepatic accumulation of a1AT mutant Z protein in the polymerized conformation. Markers of hepatocellular injury, including cleavage of caspase 12 and hepatic fibrosis, were also decreased. In conclusion, this is the first report of a successful in vivo method for reduction of intrahepatic a1AT mutant Z polymerized protein. Application of this finding may be therapeutic in patients with a1AT deficiency by reducing the intracellular burden of the polymerized, mutant Z protein and by reducing the progression of liver injury.
Concerns regarding the safety of nifedipine emerged in 1995 with the report of an increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with adult patients receiving short-acting calcium channel blockers. There have been few case reports of adverse events in children. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect on blood pressure (BP) and the incidence of adverse events associated with nifedipine in our pediatric population. We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who received nifedipine. We recorded the dose administered, all BP measurements and all adverse events reported within six hours of a nifedipine dose regardless of the likelihood that those events were related to the nifedipine dose. 1,746 doses of nifedipine in 166 pediatric patients were reviewed. Systolic BP decreased by a mean of 17% and a maximum of 63%. Diastolic BP decreased by a mean of 28% and a maximum of 89%. Adverse events included: a) change in neurologic status, six cases; b) hypotension, two cases; c) oxygen desaturation, 16 cases. Neurologic events occurred in 33% of patients with acute CNS injury and 3.6% of all patients. Short-acting nifedipine is an important and effective oral antihypertensive agent which can be safely used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in children. It should be used with caution in children with acute CNS injury.
