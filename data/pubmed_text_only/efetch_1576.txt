Oxamniquine is a potent schistosomicide used clinically in the treatment of infections due to Schistosoma mansoni. Although relatively well tolerated, some central nervous system (CNS) effects characterised by convulsions have been reported in a small proportion of the population receiving this drug. Oxamniquine, the major metabolite and the secondary alcohol have been screened for convulsant activity by assessing their ability to potentiate catechol induced seizures in urethane anaesthetised mice. Significant (p < 0.05) potentiation was observed with subconvulsive doses (1.5 mg/kg) of strychnine. In contrast, oxamniquine and the secondary alcohol, each at 200 mg/kg ip, both produced significant (p < 0.05) depressions of seizures in this model whereas no effect was seen following 140 mg/kg ip of the acid derivative. These results indicate anticonvulsant rather than convulsant activity in oxamniquine and the alcohol derivative. The failure to observe any effect with the acid derivative may have been due to poorer CNS penetration.
The rapidly increasing level of contact allergy to methyldibromoglutaronitrile (MDBGN) in Europe is of concern. In April 2003, the EU Commission prohibited the use of MDBGN in leave-on cosmetic products, such as creams and lotions, until a level of safe use can be defined. Industry risk assessment has indicated that such a safe level could be 50-100 p.p.m.
To determine whether 50 p.p.m. or 100 p.p.m. could be tolerated by MDBGN-sensitized individuals, and to evaluate if the risk for elicitation of MDBGN allergy is higher for a leave-on product with a high lipid content than for a product with a low lipid content.
Eighteen volunteers with contact allergy to MDBGN and 10 healthy controls were exposed to repeated open application tests (ROATs) with two moisturizers with a high and a low lipid content, respectively, both containing MDBGN at a concentration of 50 p.p.m. The ROATs were performed on the left and the right side of the neck for 14 days, or until a positive reaction was seen. If a positive reaction did not develop within the first 14 days, two analogous moisturizers containing 100 p.p.m. MDBGN were applied for a further 14 days. Clinical assessments were done on days 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 or when a reaction developed.
Eleven of 18 (61%) subjects developed dermatitis on the test area, of whom 10 developed a positive reaction to the 50 p.p.m. moisturizer, seven having a positive reaction on day 2 or 3. Reactions to the low-lipid moisturizer were the more frequent. All participants used more of the low-lipid moisturizer than the high-lipid moisturizer. The controls all had negative ROATs.
Even 50 p.p.m. cannot be regarded as a safe concentration for use and the prohibition of MDBGN is scientifically well founded.
Skin-infiltrating T cells play a predominant role in allergic and inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. These T cells are attracted by chemotactic factors, e.g. RANTES (regulation on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; CCL5), TARC (thymus and activation regulated chemokine; CCL17) and CTACK (cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine; CCL27).
To investigate which T-cell-attracting chemokines are involved in allergic contact dermatitis in mice.
Allergic contact dermatitis was induced by application of dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) or toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI), and chemokine concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects on chemokine concentrations of the highly selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor cilomilast and the glucocorticoid diflorasone diacetate were studied in mouse ears.
RANTES and TARC were elevated in both models of allergic contact dermatitis 24 h after challenge, whereas CTACK remained unchanged. The increase in RANTES was diminished in mouse ears pretreated with cilomilast or diflorasone diacetate. TARC was reduced by diflorasone diacetate in the DNCB model but was highly induced in the TDI model; in contrast, TARC was not influenced by cilomilast.
TARC and RANTES, but not CTACK, are involved in these two models of allergic contact dermatitis.
In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto controls (WKY), prolonged intravenous infusions of either arginine vasopressin (AVP, 8 mU X kg-1 X min-1) or phenylephrine (PE, 20 nmol X kg-1 X min-1) resulted in similar rises in arterial pressure. Heart rate fell greatly in the WKY but not in the SHR. Withdrawal of the PE infusion resulted in moderate decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate; these responses were similar in SHR and WKY. At 5 h after PE withdrawal, blood pressure and heart rate returned to basal values. In contrast, withdrawal of the AVP infusion was associated with greater falls in blood pressure and rises in heart rate. Blood pressure and heart rate in both the SHR and the WKY at 5 h after AVP were significantly different from their respective basal values. The effects of AVP withdrawal on either blood pressure or heart rate were significantly greater in the SHR than in the WKY. At 5 h after the withdrawal of AVP, blood pressure in the SHR was reduced to normotensive levels. These results suggest that the withdrawal effect was specific to AVP, was more marked in the SHR, and might not result from only the rise in blood pressure seen during the intravenous infusion of the pressor agent.
Vancomycin hydrochloride treatment failure for infections caused by susceptible methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains with high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has prompted recent guidelines to recommend a higher vancomycin target trough of 15 to 20 microg/mL.
A prospective cohort study of adult patients infected with MRSA was performed to determine the distribution of vancomycin MIC and treatment outcomes with vancomycin doses targeting an unbound trough of at least 4 times the MIC. The microbiology laboratory computer records were used to identify all patients from whom MRSA was isolated from August 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005. Primary outcome measures were clinical response, mortality, and nephrotoxicity. Patients were placed into subgroups based on target trough attainment and high vs low vancomycin MIC (>/=2 vs <2 microg/mL) for efficacy and high vs low trough (>/=15 vs <15 microg/mL) for nephrotoxicity analyses.
Of the 95 patients in the study, 51 (54%) were infected with high-MIC strains and had pneumonia (77%) and/or bacteremia. An initial response rate of 74% was achieved if the target trough was attained irrespective of MIC. However, despite achieving the target trough, the high-MIC group had lower end-of-treatment responses (24/39 [62%] vs 34/40 [85%]; P = .02) and higher infection-related mortality (11/51 [24%] vs 4/44 [10%]; P=.16) compared with the low-MIC group. High MIC (P = .03) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (P = .009) were independent predictors of poor response in multivariate analysis. Nephrotoxicity occurred only in the high-trough group (11/63 [12%]), significantly predicted by concomitant therapy with other nephrotoxic agents.
High prevalence of clinical MRSA strains with elevated vancomycin MIC (2 microg/mL) requires aggressive empirical vancomycin dosing to achieve a trough greater than 15 microg/mL. Combination or alternative therapy should be considered for invasive infections caused by these strains.
Combinations of beta-blockers and vasodilators have been assessed for their ability to lower portal pressure and so prevent variceal haemorrhage. However, reservations have been raised particularly with respect to renal function and perfusion after the use of these medicines in patients with chronic liver disease. We studied the acute effects of carvedilol, a new vasodilating beta-blocker which combines non-selective beta-blockade with alpha-1 receptor antagonism, upon the haemodynamics of patients with cirrhosis.
Sixteen patients completed the study which measured the changes approximately 1 h after the administration of 25 mg oral carvedilol.
The hepatic venous pressure gradient fell from 16.7 +/- 0.9 to 13.6 +/- 1.0 mmHg (p < 0.00001), accounted for largely by reductions in the wedged hepatic venous pressure. Despite this, the azygos blood flow did not change. There was a significant fall in mean arterial pressure (94.8 +/- 4.4 cf. 84.6 +/- 4.3 mmHg; p = 0.0001), which was particularly apparent in the diastolic blood pressure of those patients with ascites. The heart rate only fell significantly in the ascitic subjects. No significant changes occurred in the cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance. Unilateral renal vein flow as measured by the reverse thermodilution technique remained constant.
Carvedilol is therefore a potent acute portal hypotensive agent which does not appear to compromise renal perfusion. However, patients with ascites are at greater risk of its systemic hypotensive action.
Our recent work (Clinckers et al., J Neurochem 2004;89:834-43) demonstrated that intrahippocampal perfusion of 2 nM dopamine or serotonin via a microdialysis probe offered complete protection against focal pilocarpine-induced limbic seizures and did not influence basal extracellular hippocampal glutamate levels. Ten nanomolar dopamine or serotonin perfusion, however, worsened seizures and was accompanied by significant extracellular glutamate increases to approximately 200%. The significance of these glutamate elevations in seizure generation remains unclear. The present microdialysis study investigated the modulatory role of extracellular hippocampal glutamate levels in these monoaminergic protective and proconvulsant effects.
A first group of male Wistar albino rats was perfused intrahippocampally for 240 min with 6.25 microM glutamate alone to increase extracellular levels by 200%. Other animals were perfused with anticonvulsant concentrations of monoamines throughout the experiments while receiving continuous coperfusions of 6.25 microM glutamate either before, during, and after (240 min) or only after (100 min) pilocarpine perfusion (40 min). Rats were scored for epileptic behavior, and the mean scores were compared with those of the control group. Microdialysates were analyzed for monoamine and glutamate content with microbore liquid chromatography.
No convulsions occurred during glutamate perfusion alone. When monoamines and glutamate were coperfused before pilocarpine administration, the anticonvulsant effect of the monoamines was lost. Glutamate addition after pilocarpine administration did not affect monoaminergic seizure protection.
These results indicate that extracellular glutamate increases per se do not necessarily induce seizures but that they can modulate the anticonvulsant effects exerted by hippocampal monoamines.
Nefiracetam (NEF) is a novel pyrrolidone-type nootropic agent, and it has been reported to possess various pharmacologic effects as well as cognition-enhancing effects. The present study focused on the anticonvulsant effect of NEF and its potential for antiepileptic therapy.
The anticonvulsant properties of NEF were investigated in experimental seizure models of mice and rats, compared with levetiracetam (LEV) and other standard antiepileptic drugs [AEDs; zonisamide (ZNS), phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid (VPA), diazepam (DZP), and ethosuximide (ESM)]. With reference to standard programs for evaluating potential AEDs, the study included the traditional maximal electroshock seizure and subcutaneous chemoconvulsant (pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline, picrotoxin, strychnine, or N-methyl-D-aspartate) seizure tests and two threshold models (the increasing-current electroshock seizure test and intravenous pentylenetetrazole seizure threshold test). Neurotoxic activities were examined with the rotarod test and traction test.
NEF inhibited electroshock-induced seizures at nontoxic doses, whereas it had no effect on seizures chemically induced by pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline, picrotoxin, strychnine, or N-methyl-D-aspartate. The anticonvulsant spectrum of NEF paralleled that of ZNS, PHT, and CBZ. The anticonvulsant efficacy of NEF was comparable with that of ZNS and less potent than that of PHT, CBZ, and DZP. However, the safety margin of NEF was superior to that of ZNS, CBZ, VPA, and DZP. LEV showed only slight anticonvulsant effects in threshold models, and it was not effective in conventional screening models.
These results suggest that NEF has distinct anticonvulsant spectrum and mechanisms from those of LEV. NEF is an orally active and safe AED, and it possesses a potential for antiepileptic therapy.
Our previous studies had revealed that the dysregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression was a frequent event in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and may be associated with enhanced metastatic potential. To further evaluate the mechanism of SOD2-mediated metastasis in TSCC, TSCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials (i.e., the highly metastatic UM1 line and the UM2 line, which displays fewer metastases) were used. Compared to UM2 cells, UM1 cells exhibited significantly higher SOD2 activity and intracellular H(2)O(2); higher protein levels of Snail, MMP1, and pERK1/2; lower protein levels of E-cadherin; and no difference in catalase activity. Upon knockdown of SOD2 by RNA interference, UM1 cells displayed significantly reduced migration and invasion abilities; reduced activities of SOD2; lower intracellular H(2)O(2); decreased protein levels of Snail, MMP1, and pERK1/2; and increased protein levels of E-cadherin. The migration and invasion abilities of UM2 and SOD2 shRNA-transfected UM1 cells were enhanced by H(2)O(2) treatment and accompanied by increased protein levels of Snail, MMP1, and pERK1/2 and decreased protein levels of E-cadherin. Moreover the migration and invasion abilities of UM1 cells were decreased after catalase treatment. Thus, we conclude that the SOD2-dependent production of H(2)O(2) contributes to both the migration and the invasion of TSCC via the Snail signaling pathway, through increased Snail, MMP1, and pERK1/2 protein levels and the repression of the E-cadherin protein.
The epithelial barrier is determined primarily by intercellular tight junctions (TJs). We have demonstrated previously that all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) plays an important role in forming functional TJs through a specific retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/retinoid X receptor heterodimer in epithelial cells. However, the physiological relevance of retinoic acids (RAs) in maintaining the epithelial integrity remains to be examined. Here, we show that several types of RA, including atRA, promote the barrier function of epithelial TJs. Conversely, RA depletion in the cells by overexpressing CYP26s, cytochrome P450 enzymes specifically involved in the metabolic inactivation of RAs, induces an increase of permeability as measured by two differently sized tracer molecules, inulin and mannitol. This RA-mediated enhancement of barrier function is potentially associated with the increased expression of TJ-associated genes such as occludin, claudin-1, claudin-4, and zonula occludens-1. We also found that RARalpha is a preferential regulator of the epithelial barrier in vitro. Studies of murine experimental colitis, which is characterized by increased gut permeability, reveal that RARalpha stimulation significantly attenuates the loss of the epithelial barrier during colitis in vivo. Our results suggest that cellular RA bioavailability determines the epithelial integrity, because it is a critical regulator for barrier protection during mucosal injuries.
We report a case in which vocal and motor tics (Tourettism) developed after the administration of clomipramine hydrochloride in a young patient with obsessive compulsive disorder and schizoid personality disorder. Several hypotheses for this occurrence are proposed based on the suggested pathogenesis of Tourette syndrome.
A 63-year old man developed severe perianal and palmar contact dermatitis caused by sensitization to iodopropynyl butylcarbamate in moist sanitary wipes. Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate is increasingly employed as preservative in common cosmetic formulations and moist sanitary wipes as substitute for the previously frequently used sensitizers isothiazolinones and methyldibromoglutaronitrile. The allergic potential of diverse preservatives is a serious problem for the cosmetic industry, since truly hypoallergenic preservatives are not available but products such as moist sanitary wipes in large packages definitely require some form of protection.
The identification of differentially regulated apoptotic signals in normal and tumor cells allows the development of cancer cell-selective therapies. Increasing evidence shows that the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins survivin and XIAP are highly expressed in tumor cells but are absent or have very low levels of expression in normal adult tissues. We found that inhibiting AKT activity with 10 to 100 nM deguelin, a small molecule derived from natural products, markedly reduced the levels of both survivin and XIAP, inducing apoptosis in human breast cancer cells but not in normal cells. It is noteworthy that we detected an elevated level of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a signature of caspase activation, without a significant increase in caspase activity in deguelin-treated cancer cells. Our results suggest that severe down-regulation of the IAPs by deguelin releases their inhibitory activity over pre-existing active caspases present in cancer cells, inducing apoptosis without the need for further caspase activation. Because normal cells have very low levels of p-AKT, XIAP, survivin, and pre-existing caspase activity, deguelin had little effect on those cells. In addition, we found that combining deguelin with chemotherapy drugs enhanced drug-induced apoptosis selectively in human tumor cells, which suggests that deguelin has great potential for chemosensitization and could represent a new therapeutic agent for treatment of breast cancer.
1. Eight dogs were given two infusions of digoxin 0.1 mg/kg, one over 9 min and the other one over 90 min in a randomized sequence, allowing at least 12 days between each experiment. 2. Digoxin plasma profiles reflected the rate of digoxin infusion, the peak concentration of drug attained at the end of each infusion being considerably higher but more transient after the 9 min than after the 90 min transfusion. 3. Digoxin reduced the amount of acetylstrophanthidin required to produce electrocardiographic evidence of cardiotoxicity. This increase in cardiac sensitivity at 150 and at 360 min after the start of the digoxin infusion was independent of rate of infusion. 4. These results suggest that the development of cardiotoxicity is dependent upon the quantity of digoxin delivered into the systemic circulation regardless of the plasma concentration. 5. By inference, cardiotoxicity is related solely to the amount and not the rate of absorption from a given dose of digoxin.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with D-penicillamine (D-pen) in doses of 100, 250 or 500 mg/kg per day for 10, 32, 42 or 70 days. In addition animals were examined 28 days after withdrawal from 42 day's treatment with D-pen at 100 or 500 mg/kg per day. Pair-fed rats served as controls. The changes in aortic collagen, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), DNA and RNA were studied. D-Pen had a dose- and time-related solubilizing effect on aortic collagen, which regained normal resistance to extraction within 28 days after cessation of the treatment. In contrast, D-pen caused a progressive accumulation of hydroxyproline (Hyp) in the aortic wall during and after treatment, probably mediated by an increased number of matrix synthesizing cells, as judged by augmentation of the DNA content in the presence of unaltered Hyp/DNA and RNA/DNA ratios. The relative amount of type III collagen was increased after 500 mg/kg per day D-pen for 10 and 42 days. High doses of D-pen increased the percentage of water in the aortic wall and reduced the ratio of Hyp to total tissue protein, suggesting an increased content of water-binding substances. This was confirmed by GAG accumulation. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin 4,6-sulphate (CHS) were predominant after 32 and 42 days, whereas CHS, heparan sulphate (HS) and dermatan sulphate (DS) prevailed after 70 days of treatment. These observations suggest that processes of repair and regeneration are elicited secondary to the inhibitory effect of D-pen on aortic collagen and elastin crosslinking. Hypertrophy of the vessel wall may imply an increased rigidity, resulting in further increase of the susceptibility to haemodynamic injury.
Fibrates, the PPAR alpha ligand-like compounds increase the expression of proximal tubule liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and significantly decrease cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. To study whether the bezafibrate-mediated upregulation of renal L-FABP was involved in this cytoprotective effect we treated transgenic mice of PPAR agonists inducible human L-FABP expression with cisplatin in the presence or absence of bezafibrate. Blood urea nitrogen was unchanged in the first day but increased 3 days after cisplatin. While urinary L-FABP increased over 100-fold 1 day after cisplatin treatment in the transgenic mice it was significantly reduced when these transgenic mice were pretreated with bezafibrate. Cisplatin-induced renal necrosis and apoptosis were significantly reduced in bezafibrate pretreated transgenic mice and this correlated with decreased accumulation of lipid and lipid peroxidation products. Immunohistochemical analysis of kidney tissue of bezafibrate-cisplatin-treated transgenic mice showed preservation of cytoplasmic L-FABP in the proximal tubule, but this was reduced in transgenic mice treated only with cisplatin. L-FABP mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in bezafibrate-cisplatin-treated transgenic mice when compared to mice not fibrate treated. Our study shows that the bezafibrate-mediated upregulation of proximal tubule L-FABP plays a pivotal role in the reduction of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.
Parathyroidectomy is the only effective therapy for osteitis fibrosa cystica in hyperparathyroidism.
The objective of this study was to describe the changes of skeletal and nonskeletal manifestations in a patient with hyperparathyroidism and renal failure after oral vitamin D therapy.
This was a descriptive case report.
The patient was followed up in a referral center.
A 55-yr-old male patient with moderate renal failure was referred for expansile lytic lesions affecting several ribs and the spinous process of T12. His creatinine was 1.8 mg/dl; calcium, 8.9 mg/dl; PTH, 666 pg/ml; and 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D, 27 pg/ml. Bone mineral density (BMD) Z-scores by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were -4.1 at the spine, -1.7 at the hip, and -4.3 at the forearm.
The main outcome measures were the skeletal manifestations of hyperparathyroidism.
At 10 months of therapy, calcium level was 10 mg/d, PTH level declined to 71 pg/ml, and BMD increased by 12% at the spine and 18% at the hip. Computerized tomography (CT) cuts revealed marked regression in the lytic lesions. At 2 yr, BMD increased by an additional 6% at the spine, and there were no further changes in the lytic lesions by CT. The vitamin D receptor genotype using the restriction enzymes Bsm1, Taq1, and Apa1 was Bb, tt, and AA.
We showed regression of severe skeletal abnormalities of hyperparathyroidism documented by serial CT images in response to oral vitamin D therapy. It is possible that the vitamin D receptor genotype of the patient modulated this response.
Turcot's syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by the concurrence of primary brain tumors and colon cancers and/or multiple colorectal adenomas. We report a Turcot family with no parental consanguinity, in which two affected sisters, with no history of tumors in their parents, died of a brain tumor and of a colorectal tumor, respectively, at a very early age. The proband had a severe microsatellite instability (MIN) phenotype in both tumor and normal colon mucosa, and mutations in the TGFbeta-RII and APC genes in the colorectal tumor. We identified two germline mutations within the PMS2 gene: a G deletion (1221delG) in exon 11 and a four-base-pair deletion (2361delCTTC) in exon 14, both of which were inherited from the patient's unaffected parents. These results represent the first evidence that two germline frameshift mutations in PMS2, an MMR gene which is only rarely involved in HNPCC, are not pathogenic per se, but become so when occurring together in a compound heterozygote. The compound heterozygosity for two mutations in the PMS2 gene has implications for the role of protein PMS2 in the mismatch repair mechanism, as well as for the presymptomatic molecular diagnosis of at-risk family members. Furthermore, our data support and enlarge the notion that high DNA instability in normal tissues might trigger the development of cancer in this syndrome.
The expression of calcitonin (CT) and CT-receptor (CTR) mRNA in primary prostate tumors increase with tumor progression. Since advanced prostate tumors display chemoresistance, we tested a hypothesis that CT increases apoptosis resistance of prostate cells against cytotoxic drugs. We examined the effect of CT on etoposide-induced apoptosis in PC-3M, LNCaP and NRP-152 cell lines. The cytoprotective actions of CT were then tested on paclitaxel-, dexamethasone- and selenite-induced apoptosis. We also examined cytotoxic actions of these drugs in CTR-silenced PC-3M cells. Since the role of Akt and inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) in chemoresistance of advanced prostate cancers has been established, we tested the effect of CT on phospho-Akt and survivin levels in PC-3M cells. Finally, the cytoprotective effect of CT on PC-3M cells was tested in the presence of PI3K inhibitors such as LY 294002 and wortmannin. Acutely added CT significantly attenuated apoptosis of PC cell lines in response to etoposide, dexamethasone and selenite treatment, but could not reduce paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. CT potently stimulated phospho-Akt and survivin synthesis in PC-3M cells in a sustained manner, and LY 294002 attenuated CT-induced survivin synthesis as well as apoptosis resistance. These results suggest that CT induces chemoresistance to etoposide, dexamethasone and selenite but not to paclitaxel in prostate cells. Cytoprotective action of CT is mediated by CTR-induced activation of Akt-survivin pathway. Since CT/CTR expression in prostate cancers increases with tumor progression, the suppression of "CT System" may enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy.
Thirty-nine hemophiliac patients, negative for human immunodeficiency virus, with chronic hepatitis C who failed to respond to interferon (IFN) at 3 million units (MU) given subcutaneously thrice weekly for at least 3 months were retreated with 5 MU IFN for 6 months followed by 3 MU IFN in combination with daily oral doses of 1 or 1.2 g ribavirin. Thirty-four patients (87%) completed the study. In 4 patients treatment was discontinued because of treatment-related symptoms; 1 patient dropped out. Dosage reduction was required in 10 patients (26%) because of ribavirin-related anemia or IFN-related side effects. By intention-to-treat analysis, 14 (37%) had a sustained virologic response with preference for those infected by genotypes other than type 1 (43% versus 12%) and with high transaminases levels (168 U/L versus 116 U/L). Thus, IFN and ribavirin combination therapy led to a sustained suppression of hepatitis in one third of hemophiliac patients resistant to conventional monotherapy.
The efficacy and side effects of epidural bolus injection of 4 mg of morphine in a volume of 2 ml, 10 ml, or 20 ml (groups I, II and III) for postoperative analgesia after caesarean section (60 patients) were evaluated. All patients had epidural anaesthesia established up to T4 level with 0.5% bupivacaine 18-20 ml, supplemented with 2% lidocaine with adrenaline, when necessary. Morphine 4 mg in either of the three volumes was injected through the epidural catheter in random order after delivery of the baby. Six patients in each group reported no pain during the 24-h follow-up period. No additional pain medication during the 24 h after surgery was required in 11, 14 and 10 patients in groups I, II and III, respectively. Most of the others managed with the addition of a single dose of rectal ketoprofen. There were no differences in analgesic therapy between the groups. Pruritus was the most common adverse effect (18/20, 19/20 and 18/20 in groups I, II and III, respectively). 10/20, 12/20 and 14/20 (N.S.) patients had nausea and vomiting in groups I, II and III, respectively. Metoclopramide, prescribed for persistent nausea, was given to 4/20 patients in group I, 6/20 patients in group II and 9/20 patients in group III (N.S.). After removal of the urinary catheter 7/20 patient in group III required carbachol for urinary retention compared to 3/20 and 4/20 patients in groups I and II (N.S.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Exposure to gamma radiation causes a wide range of biological damage and alterations, including oxidative stress, inflammation and cancer. This study aimed to identify the radioprotective effect of Korean red ginseng extract (RG) against whole-body gamma-irradiation (γIR) in mice and the regulatory mechanisms of the radiosensitive gene in spleen, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). RG was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) or orally (p.o.) to C57BL/6 mice for five days, which were then exposed to 6.5 Gy of (137)Cs-γIR. Thymus and spleen were harvested after three days, and organ size and COX-2 expression of the spleen using Western blotting, were examined. γIR shrank both organs and RG recovered the size of thymus but not spleen. RG also significantly inhibited the increased expression of COX-2 induced by γIR. These results were similar following both routes of RG administration, however i.p. RG administration was more effective, thus it was used in progressive studies. In terms of COX-2 expression related intracellular factors, we found here that γIR activated the p38 MAPK, PI3K/Akt and HO-1 but not NF-κB or Nrf2. Activated p38 MAPK, PI3K/Akt and HO-1 were down-regulated by RG while the RG-induced COX-2 expression was only related to HO-1 activation. These results suggest that RG supplementation provides protective effects against radiation-induced inflammation and cancer, and its potential to be utilized in clinical trials and functional foods.
10 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma were treated with 10 cycles of m-BACOD. 7 patients presented with a pathological stage IV, 2 with a clinical stage III and one with a clinical stage II disease. 8 patients have been in complete remission for 3-21 months (mean 9 months) after completion of therapy. One patient with T-immunoblastic lymphoma and bulky mass died of progressive disease after 6 cycles of m-BACOD. A second patient with T-immunoblastic lymphoma relapsed 24 months after completion of therapy. Treatment-related major complications, especially MTX-related ulcerative stomatitis, did not occur.
