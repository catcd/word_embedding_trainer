The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the potential of Eudragit EPO nanoparticles (EPO NP) in improving therapeutic efficacy of meloxicam (MLX). MLX loaded EPO NP were prepared by nanoprecipitation method and were characterized for particle size, encapsulation efficiency and for morphology. The in vitro dissolution profile of MLX loaded EPO NP and MLX suspension was evaluated. MLX loaded EPO NP had particle size of approximately 100 nm and the encapsulation efficiency of MLX was approximately 90%. The EPO NP significantly improved anti-inflammatory activity of MLX (P < 0.01) as compared to that of MLX suspension. The enhanced anti-inflammatory effect was maintained for a longer duration (6 h) in case of MLX loaded EPO NP Oral administration of MLX loaded EPO NP also resulted in lesser ulcerogenicity as compared to that of MLX suspension indicating that nanoparticles can also decrease the adverse effects associated with MLX treatment.
There has been the clinical impression that people with higher levels of anxiety and central arousal are more prone to develop cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP), but this notion has not been formally studied. In the current study, we examined the differences between 28 CIP-endorsing and 16 CIP-denying chronic cocaine users in their levels of state and trait anxiety as measured by the Spielberger State-Tait Anxiety Inventory. We also studied levels of central arousal and reactivity using pupil size measures both during exposure to neutral, abstract, non-drug cues, and after exposure to a cocaine cue. Levels of trait (but not state) anxiety were significantly higher in the CIP group than in the non-CIP group. Moreover, while there were no significant pupil size differences or changes between the two groups while viewing neutral, abstract video images, the CIP group had significantly greater pupillary dilation in response to a video image of crack cocaine than did the non-CIP group. These significant differences remained even after covarying for anxiety scores. The study findings seem relevant to studies of autonomic reactivity in response to drug cues in cocaine-dependent patients; such studies might remain attentive to potential cue reactivity differences between patients endorsing and those denying CIP. Finally, this is the first study showing higher trait anxiety in patients with CIP.
Simultaneous administration of one dose of indomethacin (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) and furosemide (1 mg/kg, i.v.) was given to 8 consecutive premature infants who had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and oliguria because of prerenal failure. Four infants responded with ductus closure and 2 infants showed improvement in echocardiogram and clinical distress. There was a significant increase in U/O, GFR, FENa and FECl following drug administration. This study suggests that simultaneous administration of indomethacin and furosemide can be safely used in infants with PDA and oliguria.
Catatonia as a clozapine withdrawal syndrome has not been documented. We report a case of excited catatonia with fever, autonomic instability, and delirium--a picture of malignant catatonia (lethal catatonia) after abrupt clozapine withdrawal. The use of conventional neuroleptics transformed the excited malignant catatonia into a stuporous state resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Such a transformation of excited lethal catatonia into NMS has been described in the literature, providing support for the hypothesis that NMS is a variant of catatonia. Opinions, however, have been conflicting whether lethal catatonia and NMS are indistinguishable. We argue that NMS may be regarded as a neuroleptic-induced retarded (stuporous) subtype of malignant catatonia, clinically indistinguishable from nonneuroleptic retarded malignant catatonia but different from the excited form. To differentiate between the two subtypes of malignant catatonia would help resolve the controversy. The nosological status of excited catatonia, a poorly studied condition, remains unclear. The two subtypes of catatonia may differ in pathophysiology and responses to treatment. Clinicians should be alert to catatonia as a possible clozapine withdrawal phenomenon, and excited catatonia deserves more research attention.
Three enzymatic activities associated with pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis were monitored at weekly or bi-weekly intervals during 2-acetylaminofluorene- (0.025% in a Farber Basal Carcinogenic diet) induced hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth of six enzymes in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, declined in activity while UDP kinase and CTP synthetase showed sequential increases in activity. The alterations in activity appeared to be cyclic, followed by a full or partial return to control values. Three full cycles were monitored. The first cycle preceded nodule formation. The second cycle accompanied nodule formation and preceded sialoglycoconjugate changes reported previously. The third cycle accompanied the early glycoconjugate changes. The cyclic pattern was reproducible in three separate experiments. In each cycle, the order of events was as follows: decrease in dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, sequential increases in UDP kinase, CTP synthetase and CMPsialic acid synthase, and finally increases in the enzyme lactosylceramide: CMPsialic acid sialyltransferase, lipid-soluble sialic acid and total sialic acid. In livers of animals fed 1.87% of the hepatotoxin, 4-acetamidophenol, no biochemical alterations resembling those induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene were obtained, despite acute centrilobular necrosis of the livers. The findings point to a biochemical cascade beginning with administration of carcinogen and continuing through the development of hyperplastic nodules and of frank carcinomas resulting not from hepatotoxicity but as events associated with the hepatocarcinogenic progression.
Whether the placenta contributes to some of the abnormal hormonal profiles in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) pregnancies and whether GDM affects placental endocrine signaling pathways are yet to be established. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in the expression of the placental steroid and peptide hormone synthesis-related factors, enzymes and their receptors between normal and GDM pregnancies. Nine term placentae from GDM pregnancies and twelve from healthy pregnancies were collected. The results of immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and semiquantitative RT-PCR indicated that mRNA and protein levels of leptin, leptin receptors, androgen receptor and FGF2 were significantly higher in the GDM placentae than non-GDM placentae; while NRIH3, NRIH2, StARD3, CYP11A1, HSD3B, HSD11B, HSD17B, ERalpha, ERbeta, progesterone receptor, FGF receptor-2, insulin receptor-alpha and -beta showed no differences. Interestingly, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that aromatase protein concentrations in the GDM placentae were significantly reduced without a change in mRNA levels. Moreover, androgen upregulated FGF2 expression in the placental villous explants. These findings suggest that the placentae of GDM pregnancies contribute to elevated testosterone and leptin levels due to a decrease in the conversion of testosterone to estrogens and to an increase in leptin production. The androgen and leptin signaling pathways may be over-activated by the presence of excessive ligands and overexpressed receptors in GDM placentae. Dysregulation of these two endocrine networks may contribute to placental abnormalities eventually increasing the frequency of maternal and fetal complications associated with GDM.
Severe poisoning has recently been diagnosed in humans having hip implants composed of cobalt-chrome alloys due to the release of particulate wear debris on polyethylene and ceramic implants which stimulates macrophagic infiltration and destroys bone and soft tissue, leading to neurological, sensorial and muscular impairments. Consistent with this premise, in this study, we focused on the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of Co(II) ions on skeletal muscle using mouse skeletal C2C12 myotubes as an in vitro model. As detected using propidium iodide incorporation, increasing CoCl2 doses (from 5 to 200Î¼M) affected the viability of C2C12 myotubes, mainly by cell necrosis, which was attenuated by necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of the necroptotic branch of the death domain receptor signaling pathway. On the other hand, apoptosis was hardly detectable as supported by the lack of caspase-3 and -8 activation, the latter resulting in only faint activation after exposure to higher CoCl2 doses for prolonged time points. Furthermore, CoCl2 treatment resulted in atrophy of the C2C12 myotubes which was characterized by the increased expression of HSP25 and GRP94 stress proteins and other typical `pro-atrophic molecular hallmarks, such as early activation of the NF-kB pathway and down-regulation of AKT phosphorylation, followed by the activation of the proteasome and autophagy systems. Overall, these results suggested that cobalt may impact skeletal muscle homeostasis as an inducer of cell necrosis and myofiber atrophy.
The abuse of anabolic steroids has been well documented in the literature. In contrast, relatively little is written about the abuse potential of glucocorticoids. A case report of a 51-year-old man with substance dependence on prednisone is reported. The limited available literature on the abuse of glucocorticoids is briefly reviewed, and the challenge of treating patients who abuse these medications discussed.
A 48 year-old white male not suffering from endocrine disease or polydipsia, not taking diuretics, and suffering from no renal disease was started on risperidone and discharged on no other drug from Western Missiouri Mental Health Center (WMMHC) after an 8-day hospitalization. Seven days later he was admitted to a university medical center with generalized seizures, hyponatremia, respiratory failure, and rhabdomyalysis. He eventually recovered, was transferred back to WMMHC, and stabilized on appropriate medication. A search of the literature indicates no case reports linking risperidone to hyponatremia. It is assumed that the mechanism of hyponatremia is similar to other psychotropic medication in that it is secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
Fexofenadine is a nonsedating antihistamine approved for treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
This dose-finding study assessed the safety and efficacy of fexofenadine in chronic idiopathic urticaria.
The 4-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study included patients diagnosed with chronic urticaria who had moderate to severe pruritus. Patients received twice daily oral doses of placebo or fexofenadine HCl (20, 60, 120, or 240 mg) at 7 AM and 7 PM. Patients recorded scores for pruritus severity and number of wheals (over the previous 12 hours) in a daily diary. Efficacy variables included mean daily changes from baseline in pruritus severity, number of wheals, and interference with sleep and daily activities due to urticaria.
Patients (N = 418) from 37 investigative sites were included. All four fexofenadine HCl doses were statistically superior to placebo (P < or = .0115) for reducing pruritus and number of wheals scores over the 4-week treatment period. There were greater reductions in urticaria symptoms in the 60 mg fexofenadine HCl group than in the 20 mg group, while similar reductions were observed in the 60, 120, and 240 mg dose groups. Additionally, patients receiving fexofenadine experienced significantly less interference with sleep and daily activities than patients receiving placebo (P < or = .0014). Adverse events occurred with similar incidence in all treatment groups, with no dose-related increases in any event.
Fexofenadine HCl significantly reduced pruritus severity, number of wheals, and interference with sleep and normal daily activities in patients with chronic urticaria compared with placebo. Twice-daily doses of 60 mg or greater were most effective.
A 70 year old heart and renal transplanted man was hospitalized twice for acute abdominal pain with jaundice, inflammatory syndrome and cholestasis following colchicine therapy. All signs and symptoms abated after colchicine's withdrawal. Because the investigations remained negative and the temporal relationship positive, an adverse drug reaction to colchicine was considered possible.
Environmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p, p'-DDE) has been associated with the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
We conducted a case-control study nested within the Physicians' Health Study, a prospective cohort established in 1982. We measured concentrations of PCBs and p,p'-DDE in baseline blood samples from 205 men later diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 409 age- and race-matched controls. Lipid-adjusted organochlorine concentrations were categorized into quintiles based on the distribution among controls. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each quintile relative to the lowest quintile. We also evaluated these associations for major histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
The risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was positively associated with the sum of 51 PCB congeners assayed (SigmaPCB); the group of immunotoxic congeners; the individual congeners 118, 138, 153, and 180; and the sum of these 4 congeners. The simple OR for the highest quintile of lipid-adjusted SigmaPCB versus the lowest was 1.9 (95% CI = 1.1-3.2; test for trend, P = 0.001), with similar trends for individual congeners and groups defined as above. Adjustment for height, body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking, and fish intake did not substantially change the effect estimates. No association was observed for p,p'-DDE. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity in effects by histologic subtype of lymphoma; however, this analysis was underpowered.
These results support the hypothesis of a positive association between PCB exposure and development of NHL in men.
Oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OPAHs) are byproducts of combustion and photo-oxidation of parent PAHs. OPAHs are widely present in the environment and pose an unknown hazard to human health. The developing zebrafish was used to evaluate a structurally diverse set of 38 OPAHs for malformation induction, gene expression changes and mitochondrial function. Zebrafish embryos were exposed from 6 to 120h post fertilization (hpf) to a dilution series of 38 different OPAHs and evaluated for 22 developmental endpoints. AHR activation was determined via CYP1A immunohistochemistry. Phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PHEQ), 1,9-benz-10-anthrone (BEZO), xanthone (XAN), benz(a)anthracene-7,12-dione (7,12-B[a]AQ), and 9,10-anthraquinone (9,10-ANTQ) were evaluated for transcriptional responses at 48hpf, prior to the onset of malformations. qRT-PCR was conducted for a number of oxidative stress genes, including the glutathione transferase(gst), glutathione peroxidase(gpx), and superoxide dismutase(sod) families. Bioenergetics was assayed to measure in vivo oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in 26hpf embryos exposed to OPAHs. Hierarchical clustering of the structure-activity outcomes indicated that the most toxic of the OPAHs contained adjacent diones on 6-carbon moieties or terminal, para-diones on multi-ring structures. 5-carbon moieties with adjacent diones were among the least toxic OPAHs while the toxicity of multi-ring structures with more centralized para-diones varied considerably. 9,10-PHEQ, BEZO, 7,12-B[a]AQ, and XAN exposures increased expression of several oxidative stress related genes and decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), a measurement of mitochondrial respiration. Comprehensive in vivo characterization of 38 structurally diverse OPAHs indicated differential AHR dependency and a prominent role for oxidative stress in the toxicity mechanisms.
The potent growth-inhibitory activity of cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and their widespread expression in epithelia suggest that they may play an important role in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis. To analyse TGF-beta mediated tumor suppressor activity in the liver, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant negative type II TGF-beta receptor in hepatocytes under control of the regulatory elements of the human C-reactive protein gene promoter. Transgenic animals exhibited constitutive and liver-specific transgene expression. The functional inactivation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in transgenic hepatocytes was shown by reduced TGF-beta induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in primary hepatocyte cultures. Liver morphology and spontaneous tumorigenesis were unchanged in transgenic mice suggesting that interruption of the signaling of all three isoforms of TGF-beta in hepatocytes does not disturb tissue homeostasis in the liver under physiological conditions. However, following initiation with the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine and tumor-promotion with phenobarbital transgenic mice exhibited a moderate albeit significant increase in the incidence, size and multiplicity of both preneoplastic tissue lesions in the liver and of hepatocellular carcinomas. These results give in vivo evidence for a tumor suppressor activity of the endogenous TGF-beta system in the liver during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis.
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a widely used organochlorine pesticide and a xenoestrogen that promotes rodent hepatomegaly and tumours. A recent study has shown significant correlation between DDT serum concentration and liver cancer incidence in humans, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesised that a mixture of DDT isomers could exert effects on the liver through pathways instead of classical ERs. The acute effects of a DDT mixture containing the two major isomers p,p'-DDT (85%) and o,p'-DDT (15%) on CAR and ERÎ± receptors and their cell cycle and apoptosis target genes were studied in mouse livers. ChIP results demonstrated increased CAR and ERÎ± recruitment to their specific target gene binding sites in response to the DDT mixture. The results of real-time RT-PCR were consistent with the ChIP data and demonstrated that the DDT was able to activate both CAR and ERÎ± in mouse livers, leading to target gene transcriptional increases including Cyp2b10, Gadd45Î², cMyc, Mdm2, Ccnd1, cFos and E2f1. Western blot analysis demonstrated increases in cell cycle progression proteins cMyc, Cyclin D1, CDK4 and E2f1 and anti-apoptosis proteins Mdm2 and Gadd45Î². In addition, DDT exposure led to Rb phosphorylation. Increases in cell cycle progression and anti-apoptosis proteins were accompanied by a decrease in p53 content and its transcriptional activity. However, the DDT was unable to stimulate the Î²-catenin signalling pathway, which can play an important role in hepatocyte proliferation. Thus, our results indicate that DDT treatment may result in cell cycle progression and apoptosis inhibition through CAR- and ERÎ±-mediated gene activation in mouse livers. These findings suggest that the proliferative and anti-apoptotic conditions induced by CAR and ERÎ± activation may be important contributors to the early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis as produced by DDT in rodent livers.
Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a small molecular weight carcinogen and the prototype of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). While these compounds are primarily known for their carcinogenicity, B[a]P and its metabolites are also neurotoxic for mammalian species. To develop a prophylactic immune strategy against detrimental effects of B[a]P, female Balb/c mice immunized with a B[a]P-diphtheria toxoid (B[a]P-DT) conjugate vaccine were sub-acutely exposed to 2mg/kg B[a]P and behavioral performances were monitored in tests related to learning and memory, anxiety and motor coordination. mRNA expression of the NMDA receptor (NR1, 2A and 2B subunits) involved in the above behavioral functions was measured in 5 brain regions. B[a]P induced NMDA1 expression in three (hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum) of five brain regions investigated, and modulated NMDA2 in two of the five brain regions (frontal cortex and cerebellum). Each one of these B[a]P-effects was reversed in mice that were immunized against this PAH, with measurable consequences on behavior such as anxiety, short term learning and memory. Thus active immunization against B[a]P with a B[a]P-DT conjugate vaccine had a protective effect and attenuated the pharmacological and neurotoxic effects even of high concentrations of B[a]P.
(1) To confirm the presence of Pesticide (Endosulfan) residues in the bone marrow (BM) of children with acute hematological malignancies and compare them with controls. (2) To ascertain if children with Endosulfan in their marrow reside in areas sprayed with Endosulfan.
Case control study
Pediatric oncology unit of a medical college teaching hospital in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka.
26 patients with proven hematological malignancy and 26 age matched controls suffering from benign hematological disease.
Endosulfan residues in the BM were estimated by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Minimum detection limit 10ng/mL). The subjects geographical area of location (residence) was determined to see whether they belong to sprayed area or not. The Chi-square test was applied to see an association between exposure status and hematological malignancy.
A total of 52 children were enrolled of which 26 were study cases and 26 were controls. Of the study and control groups, 84.7% ;and 73.1%, respectively were from exposed areas. The major (88.4%) illness in the study group was ALL, while ITP (50%) occurred most frequently in the control group. Six out of 26 study cases tested positive for endosulfan in the BM, against 1 out of 26 controls (P = 0.042). The Odds ratio was 7.5. All children who had endosulfan in the bone marrow originated from areas, where endosulfan is still being used.
Children with hematological malignancy had raised levels of endosulfan in the bone marrow compared to those without. All the children with raised bone marrow Endosulfan levels were found to be from areas exposed to the pesticide.
The effects of the antianginal and antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone on mitochondrial function and high-energy phosphate content were assessed during normothermic ischaemic cardiac arrest and reperfusion in Langendorff-perfused rat heart. Total ischaemia for 30 min at 37 degrees C produced highly significant changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and high-energy phosphate content. Pretreatment of the rats with one single dose of amiodarone (20 mg/kg i.v., 30 min before killing) markedly attenuated the deleterious effect of ischaemia on mitochondrial function and slightly reduced ATP depletion. In normally perfused hearts, amiodarone pretreatment did not modify any parameter of mitochondrial respiratory function nor did it influence high-energy phosphate or glycogen content. After reperfusion for 15 min, amiodarone-treated hearts showed improved recovery of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and tissue high-energy phosphate content as compared to control hearts. Pretreatment of hearts with amiodarone did not reduce ischaemia-induced leakage of total adenylic nucleotides but highly significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase release during reperfusion. These results indicate that amiodarone could exert substantial protection on the infarcting myocardium.
In a double-blind study with parallel groups 195 hypertensive patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either conventional tablets of metoprolol, 100 mg once daily, or a new controlled-release (CR) formulation of metoprolol, 100 mg once daily. The dose was doubled if the patient's diastolic blood pressure remained greater than or equal to 95 mmHg after six weeks on 100 mg, whereas well-controlled patients continued on 100 mg once daily for a further six-week period. In the metoprolol tablet group the 200 mg dose was administered in the form of Durules. There was a significant reduction from the placebo baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate at 24 h after both six weeks and 12 weeks of active treatment; no significant difference in the mean reduction from baseline between the two groups was demonstrated. However, significantly more patients responded to treatment with metoprolol CR when compared with those patients taking metoprolol tablets. After six weeks of active treatment 61% of the metoprolol CR group and 56% of the conventional metoprolol tablet group had a diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg. After another six weeks the corresponding figures were 83% and 69% respectively. Between week 6 and 12, 36% of patients in the metoprolol CR group and 42% of patients in the conventional metoprolol tablet group were receiving a 200 mg dose. All formulations of metoprolol were well-tolerated. Fewer subjective symptoms were reported during active treatment than during the placebo phase. There were no differences between the groups with regard to changes in laboratory variables from baseline, changes in all combined symptoms, or changes in any one symptom.
Administration of hydrocortisone acetate (250 mg/kg) to newborn mice caused polycystic kidney disease (PKD) of varying proportions in each of 18 different inbred strains; none of the injected controls were affected. All kidneys were histologically examined and scored for degree of cyst formation using a semi-continuous (0 to 4+) grading scheme. Results suggested that this condition is a multifactorial threshold trait. For each strain, estimates of the mean and standard deviation of normally distributed liability were determined by maximum likelihood methods. Concomitant analyses showed: 1) a significant environmental effect related to drug source; 2) a variation in thresholds ranging from 0.94 (N = 46) for the B10.M strain to -0.71 (N = 297) for the C57B1/6J strain; and 3) three groups of strains with different susceptibility to PKD. These results are consistent with a multifactorial basis for susceptibility to PKD. Quantitative analysis of thresholds and liability distributions reveals that genetic, environmental and random elements all contribute to the expression and extent of the cystic trait.
Interleukin (IL)-18 is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine promoting TH-1 and cytotoxic immune responses through interferon (IFN)-gamma induction. The aim of this study was to investigate the production of IL-18 by squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC).
The expression of IL-18 was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and ELISA in untreated and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated HNSCC cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tumor specimens from 16 patients with primary invasive HNSCC.
We have demonstrated that HNSCC cell lines express IL-18 at the mRNA, as well as the protein, level. However, the IL-18 protein was expressed intracellularly and predominantly released as an unprocessed inactive 24-kDa form. After exposure to 5-FU, the processed form of IL-18 was detected in the supernatants of both HNSCC cell lines.
These results indicate that HNSCC cells are a potential source of IL-18 cytokine. The finding that the exposure to 5-FU can elicit its processing suggests a novel target for immunomodulatory intervention in patients with HNSCC.
We studied the protective effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-induced hypotensive anesthesia on gastric mucosa in 30 elective surgical patients. Three groups, each composed of 10 patients, received PGE1, nitroglycerin or none during general anesthesia. Then we measured the viscosity and pH of gastric fluid continuously in each group. In the PGE1 group the viscosity and pH increased significantly and rapidly (P less than 0.05) as compared with the other groups. This suggests that PGE1 offers prophylactic effect against postoperative acute gastric mucosal lesion (AGML).
A variety of hepatobiliary abnormalities has been described in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to these liver alterations are poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate parameters of liver function in a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNB)-induced rat colitis model.
Glucose output, bile acid secretion, bile acid uptake, and the cytochrome P-450 metabolic capacity during TNB-colitis were studied in the perfused liver model. Furthermore, hepatic bile acid- and glycogen content was measured. To evaluate the inflammatory response in the colon and liver, NF-kappaB/Rel was quantified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As an NF-kappaB/Rel regulated gene the inducible NO-synthase (NOS2) was evaluated by Western blot analysis. As possible mediators released from the inflamed colon into the portal vein, endotoxin and the stable metabolite of prostaglandin I2 (6-keto-prostaglandin-F1alpha) were determined.
Glucose output, bile acid secretion, bile acid uptake, and cytochrome P-450 metabolic capacity decreased on the first and second day of TNB-colitis. Hepatic bile acid content increased at day 14 of colitis. Glycogen content was reduced, most likely due to an inadequate chow intake of these animals. A low level of portal endotoxin was detectable during the first 2 days of colitis. In addition, 6-keto-prostaglandin-F1alpha was clearly increased in portal blood. NF-kappaB/Rel binding activity and inducible NOS2 were strongly positive in the colon during colitis. Although low levels of portal endotoxin were measured during the first 2 days of colitis, no significant NF-kappaB/Rel activity and NOS2 induction were detected in the liver.
Our results indicate that during the acute state of the TNB-colitis, bile acid secretion and cytochrome P-450 function are disturbed in the absence of distinct inflammatory changes in the liver.
Platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) activity is deregulated in human GBM due to amplification and rearrangement of the PDGFR-alpha gene locus or overexpression of the PDGF ligand, resulting in the activation of downstream kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Aberrant PDGFR signaling is observed in approximately 25-30% of human GBMs, which are frequently molecularly classified as the proneural subclass. It would be valuable to understand how PDGFR driven GBMs respond to Akt and mTOR inhibition.
Using genetically engineered PTEN-intact and PTEN-deficient PDGF-driven mouse models of GBM that closely mimic the histology and genetics of the human PDGF subgroup, we investigated the effect of inhibiting Akt and mTOR alone or in combination in vitro and in vivo. We used perifosine and CCI-779 to inhibit Akt and mTOR, respectively. Here, we show in vitro data demonstrating that the most effective inhibition of Akt and mTOR activity in both PTEN-intact and PTEN-null primary glioma cell cultures is obtained when using both inhibitors in combination. We next investigated if the effects we observed in culture could be duplicated in vivo by treating mice with gliomas for 5 days. The in vivo treatments with the combination of CCI-779 and perifosine resulted in decreased Akt and mTOR signaling, which correlated to decreased proliferation and increased cell death independent of PTEN status, as monitored by immunoblot analysis, histology and MRI.
These findings underline the importance of simultaneously targeting Akt and mTOR to achieve significant down-regulation of the PI3K pathway and support the rationale for testing the perifosine and CCI-779 combination in the human PDGF-subgroup of GBM.
A study was undertaken to determine whether alterations in the gene expression or overt histological signs of neurotoxicity in selected regions of the forebrain might occur from acrylamide exposure via drinking water. Gene expression at the mRNA level was evaluated by cDNA array and/or RT-PCR analysis in the striatum, substantia nigra and parietal cortex of rat after a 2-week acrylamide exposure. The highest dose tested (maximally tolerated) of approximately 44 mg/kg/day resulted in a significant decreased body weight, sluggishness, and locomotor activity reduction. These physiological effects were not accompanied by prominent changes in gene expression in the forebrain. All the expression changes seen in the 1200 genes that were evaluated in the three brain regions were < or =1.5-fold, and most not significant. Very few, if any, statistically significant changes were seen in mRNA levels of the more than 50 genes directly related to the cholinergic, noradrenergic, GABAergic or glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems in the striatum, substantia nigra or parietal cortex. All the expression changes observed in genes related to dopaminergic function were less than 1.5-fold and not statistically significant and the 5HT1b receptor was the only serotonin-related gene affected. Therefore, gene expression changes were few and modest in basal ganglia and sensory cortex at a time when the behavioral manifestations of acrylamide toxicity had become prominent. No histological evidence of axonal, dendritic or neuronal cell body damage was found in the forebrain due to the acrylamide exposure. As well, microglial activation was not present. These findings are consistent with the absence of expression changes in genes related to changes in neuroinflammation or neurotoxicity. Over all, these data suggest that oral ingestion of acrylamide in drinking water or food, even at maximally tolerable levels, induced neither marked changes in gene expression nor neurotoxicity in the motor and somatosensory areas of the central nervous system.
