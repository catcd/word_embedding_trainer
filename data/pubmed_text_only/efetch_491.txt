Fever as a drug reaction is common. It has, however, not been widely recognized as a complication of cimetidine therapy. We observed a patient who, during the administration of intravenous cimetidine, became hyperpyretic and confused. Six hours after cimetidine therapy was discontinued, he became afebrile. The potential for hyperpyrexia to occur with cimetidine should be considered in patients with unexplained fever who are receiving this drug.
Obesity is a growing worldwide problem with genetic and environmental causes, and it is an underlying basis for many diseases. Studies have shown that the toxicant-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may disrupt fat metabolism and contribute to obesity. The AHR is a nuclear receptor/transcription factor that is best known for responding to environmental toxicant exposures to induce a battery of xenobiotic-metabolizing genes.
The intent of the work reported here was to test more directly the role of the AHR in obesity and fat metabolism in lieu of exogenous toxicants.
We used two congenic mouse models that differ at the Ahr gene and encode AHRs with a 10-fold difference in signaling activity. The two mouse strains were fed either a low-fat (regular) diet or a high-fat (Western) diet.
The Western diet differentially affected body size, body fat:body mass ratios, liver size and liver metabolism, and liver mRNA and miRNA profiles. The regular diet had no significant differential effects.
The results suggest that the AHR plays a large and broad role in obesity and associated complications, and importantly, may provide a simple and effective therapeutic strategy to combat obesity, heart disease, and other obesity-associated illnesses.
Chronic daily headaches (CDH) consist of episodes of head pain occurring daily; more than 15 days each month; often associated with a history of migraine, with or without aura; or with a history of tension-type headaches occurring alone or both occurring together. Chronic daily headaches are frequently associated with rebound headaches after ergotamine, barbiturate, caffeine, and analgesic abuse. We previously reported that migraineurs with typical intermittent headaches exhibited excessive cerebral cortical vasodilation after oral acetazolamide which usually precipitated and reproduced their typical headaches. In the present study, cerebral vasodilator responses were tested by measuring changes in local cerebral blood flow (Delta LCBF) utilizing xenon-contrasted CT scanning, before and after oral administration of 14.3 mg/kg of acetazolamide, in 11 patients with CDH. The results were compared with 12 age-matched typical migraineurs, with and without aura, who had a history of migraine attacks occurring at intervals of 1 month or longer. Global and subcortical gray and white matter Delta LCBFs were quantitated and compared between both groups. After acetazolamide, Delta LCBF increased in cortical gray matter by 11.8% among patients with CDH and by 16.7% among migraineurs, with no significant differences between groups. Typical migraine attacks were provoked by acetazolamide in 9 patients (82%) with CDH and in 11 (92%) migraineurs with intermittent headaches. These observations are taken as evidence that at least 82% of patients with CDH have transformed migraine as judged by the provocation by acetazolamide of typical migraine attacks associated with excessive Delta LCBF increases. Serotonin agonists should be considered in the treatment of CDH to avoid ergotamine, caffeine, barbiturate, and analgesic abuse.
To investigate whether adjuvant treatment with CMF or tamoxifen predisposes to an unfavorable cosmetic outcome or increased breast morbidity after radiotherapy in breast conservation. Data from 266 patients who entered a randomized breast conservation trial (DBCG-82TM protocol) was analyzed. The patients were treated with lumpectomy and axillary dissection followed by external beam radiotherapy to the residual breast. High-risk patients (n = 94), as well as 31 low-risk patients, received additional radiation to the regional lymph nodes. Adjuvant systemic treatment was given to all high-risk patients: premenopausal patients (n = 67) received eight cycles of CMF intravenously (600/40/600 mg per m2) every fourth week; postmenopausal patients (n = 27) received 30 mg of tamoxifen daily for one year. Clinical assessments included cosmetic outcome, breast fibrosis, skin telangiectasia, and dyspigmentation which were scored on a 4-point categorical scale after median 6.6 years. The observations were analyzed in multivariate logistic regression analysis which included potential risk factors on outcome related to systemic treatment, surgery, radiation technique, tumor, and patient characteristics. In premenopausal patients, systemic treatment with CMF independently predicted a fair/poor cosmetic outcome, RR = 2.2 (95% CI 1.2-4.2), as well as increased skin telangiectasia, RR = 3.3 (1.4-8.2). There was no impact of tamoxifen treatment on cosmetic outcome in postmenopausal patients (p = 0.32). However, univariate analysis showed that tamoxifen was significantly associated with breast fibrosis (p < 0.004), as was radiation to the regional lymph nodes (p < 0.0001). A strong interaction between axillary irradiation and tamoxifen treatment occurred since 26 of 27 high-risk postmenopausal patients had received both tamoxifen and axillary irradiation. In multivariate regression analysis, axillary irradiation independently predicted moderate/severe breast fibrosis with a relative risk of 5.0 (2.0-12.5) and 9.6 (3.3-27.7) in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients, respectively. To circumvent the strong interaction between tamoxifen treatment and axillary irradiation, a subsequent analysis omitting axillary treatment from the multivariate regression showed a significant effect of both tamoxifen and CMF on the occurrence of breast fibrosis with relative risks of 5.3 (CI 1.8-15.8) and 4.4 (1.8-10.3), respectively. Adjuvant systemic treatment with CMF given sequentially to radiotherapy independently predicted an adverse cosmetic outcome as well as increased skin telangiectasia after breast conserving treatment. Due to a strong interaction between tamoxifen administration and radiation to the regional lymph nodes, the effect of tamoxifen on the development of fibrosis could not be fully discerned in this study. Axillary irradiation increased the incidence of moderate to severe breast fibrosis in both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients.
Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) administration has been used to prevent infectious diseases in public or as a therapeutic agent by the physicians in treatment of several diseases. Ascorbic acid is also involved in immune cell functions and immune responses, although the mechanisms by which it exerts effects on immune cells against cancer cells are not fully understood at the normal plasma level. In this study, we used the mice lacking l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase (Gulo), the enzyme required for the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid, to characterize the effects of ascorbic acid on NK cell cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer cells, MOSECs (murine ovarian surface epithelial cells). Gulo(-/-) mice depleted of ascorbic acid survived for a shorter time than the normal control or Gulo(-/-) mice supplemented with ascorbic acid after tumor challenge regardless of treatment with IL-2. CD69 and NKG2D expression was clearly reduced in NK cells isolated from mice depleted of ascorbic acid as compared to that in the normal control and the mice supplemented with ascorbic acid. We also observed that IFN-γ secretion by NK cells isolated from Gulo(-/-) mice depleted of ascorbic acid was decreased after NK cells were co-cultured with MOSECs. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of perforin and granzyme B genes was also significantly decreased in NK cells isolated from mice depleted of ascorbic acid. Taken together, our results suggest that ascorbic acid at the normal plasma concentration has an essential role in maintaining the NK cytotoxicity against cancer cells.
Adenosine and dopamine interact within the striatum to control striatopallidal output and globus pallidus GABA release. Manipulating striatal adenosine transmission via blockade of the A2A receptor subtype can compensate for the reduced dopamine activity within the striatum that underlies movement disorders such as antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Preclinical studies in the rat have demonstrated that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists can attenuate behaviors reflecting reduced dopamine activity, such as haloperidol-induced catalepsy and hypoactivity.
In the present studies using nonhuman primates, adenosine antagonists were tested against haloperidol-induced EPS in Cebus apella and haloperidol-induced catalepsy in Saimiri sciureus (squirrel monkey). Specifically, the A2A receptor antagonists, SCH 412348 (0.3-30 mg/kg PO) and KW-6002 (3-100 mg/kg PO); the A1/A2A receptor antagonist, caffeine (1-30 mg/kg PO and IM); and the A1 receptor antagonist, DPCPX (3-30 mg/kg PO) were tested in at least one of these models.
SCH 412348 (10-30 mg/kg), KW-6002 (57-100 mg/kg), and caffeine (30 mg/kg) significantly increased the time to EPS onset. Additionally, SCH 412348, KW-6002, and caffeine afforded protection from the onset of EPS for at least 6 h in some of the primates. SCH 412348 (10 mg/kg) and caffeine (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced haloperidol-induced catalepsy. DPCPX produced a very slight attenuation of EPS at 30 mg/kg, but had no effect on catalepsy.
These findings suggest that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists may represent an effective treatment for the motor impairments associated with both antipsychotic-induced EPS and PD.
Photodynamic therapy is a method for treating cancer using drugs activated by light. A new compound, 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), is a precursor of the active photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and has fewer side-effects and much more transient phototoxicity than previous photosensitizers. Cell survival of ALA-mediated photodynamic therapy was measured in the J82 bladder cancer cell line, along with its mitomycin C-resistant counterpart J82/MMC. This demonstrated that mitomycin resistance is not cross-resistant to photodynamic therapy. There was also a suggestion that the mitomycin-resistant cells were more susceptible to photodynamic therapy than the parent cell line. Photodynamic therapy appeared to enhance the effect of mitomycin C, when mitomycin C was given first. This phenomenon was apparent for both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cell lines. This suggests a possible role for combined mitomycin C and photodynamic therapy in superficial bladder tumours that have recurred despite intravesical cytotoxic drug treatment.
Dysregulation of MAL (myelin and lymphocyte protein) has been implicated in several malignancies including esophageal, ovarian, and cervical cancers. The MAL protein functions in apical transport in polarized epithelial cells; therefore, its disruption may lead to loss of organized polarity characteristic of most solid malignancies. Bisulfite sequencing of the MAL promoter CpG island revealed hypermethylation in breast cancer cell lines and 69% of primary tumors analyzed compared with normal breast epithelial cells. Differential methylation between normal and cancer DNA was confined to the proximal promoter region. In a subset of breast cancer cell lines including T47D and MCF7 cells, promoter methylation correlated with transcriptional silencing that was reversible with the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In addition, expression of MAL reduced motility and resulted in a redistribution of lipid raft components in MCF10A cells. MAL protein expression measured by immunohistochemistry revealed no significant correlation with clinicopathologic features. However, in patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, reduced MAL expression was a significant predictive factor for disease-free survival. These data implicate MAL as a commonly altered gene in breast cancer with implications for response to chemotherapy.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using break-apart red (3') and green (5') ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) probes, consistently shows rearrangements in <100% of tumor cells in ALK-positive (ALK+) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Increased copy numbers of fused and rearranged signals also occur. Here, correlations are explored between the percentage of ALK+ cells and signal copy number and their association with response to ALK inhibition.
Ninety ALK+ NSCLC cases were evaluated. The percentage of positive cells, pattern of positivity (split, single red, or both), and copy number of fused, isolated red and green signals were recorded. Thirty patients had received crizotinib.
Increased isolated red signal copy number (contributing to both single red and split patterns of positivity) correlated with a higher percentage of ALK+ cells (r = 0.743, P < .0001). Mean fused copy number was negatively associated with isolated red signal copy number (r = -0.409, P < .0001). Neither percentage of positive cells (r = 0.192, P = .3), nor copy number of isolated red signal (r = 0.274, P = .195) correlated with maximal tumor shrinkage with crizotinib.
The strong association between increased copy number of key ALK signals and percentage of positive cells suggests that the <100% rate of cellular positivity in ALK+ tumors is due to technical factors, not biological factors. In ALK+ tumors, neither the percentage of positive cells nor signal copy number appear to be informative variables for predicting benefit from ALK inhibition. The inverse relationship between fused and isolated red copy number suggests ALK+ may be a distinct "near-diploid" subtype of NSCLC that develops before significant chromosomal aneusomy occurs.
Kappa agonists can attenuate reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior induced by cocaine priming. The mechanisms underlying this effect have not been characterized fully but may have a serotonergic component as kappa agonists also increase the release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT).
This study investigated the role of kappa opioid receptor and 5-HT mechanisms in kappa agonist-induced attenuation of cocaine priming in monkeys.
Squirrel monkeys were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.18-0.3 mg/kg/injection) under a second-order schedule in which drug seeking was maintained jointly by cocaine injections and a cocaine-paired visual stimulus. In extinction sessions, saline was substituted for cocaine, and the cocaine-paired stimulus was omitted. During test sessions, only saline was available for self-administration, and response-contingent presentations of the cocaine-paired stimulus were restored.
Priming injections of cocaine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Maximal levels of responding were similar to those maintained by active cocaine self-administration. Pretreatment with the kappa agonists enadoline (0.01 mg/kg) and spiradoline (0.3 mg/kg) or the 5-HT transport inhibitors fluoxetine (5.6 mg/kg) and citalopram (10.0 mg/kg) attenuated the priming effects of cocaine, shifting the cocaine dose-response function rightward and downward. Inhibition of cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking by spiradoline and fluoxetine was reversed by R(+)8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (0.03 mg/kg), a 5HT(1A) agonist that inhibits 5-HT release. The effects of spiradoline also were reversed by the kappa antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (10.0 mg/kg).
Results suggest that the capacity of kappa opioid agonists to increase extracellular 5-HT levels may at least partially underlie kappa agonist-induced modulation of cocaine seeking.
We assess the effects of ipsapirone (a 5-HT1A receptor agonist), ketanserin (a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist), (-)-pindolol (a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist), and DOI (a 5-HT2A receptor agonist) on heatstroke in a rat model. Animals, under urethane anesthesia, were exposed to high ambient temperature of 42 degrees C until mean arterial pressure and local cerebral blood flow in the striatum began to decrease, which was arbitrarily defined as the onset of heatstroke. Normothermic controls were exposed to room temperature of 24 degrees C. In rats treated with normal saline immediately before the initiation of heat stress, the values for survival time were found to be 21 to 25 min. Systemic administration of ipsapirone (10 mg/kg) or ketanserin (2 mg/kg) immediately before the initiation of heat stress significantly increased the survival time to new values of 92 to 104 min. Combined treatment with ipsapirone and ketanserin had additive effects (survival time of 156-194 min). In contrast, systemic administration of (-)-pindolol (2 mg/kg) or DOI (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased the survival time to new values of 2 to 3 min. In vehicle-treated heatstroke rats, the values for core temperature, intracranial pressure, and the extracellular levels of cellular ischemia (e.g., glutamate and lactate/pyruvate ratio) or damage (e.g., glycerol) markers and neuronal damage scores in striatum were significantly higher than those of normothermic controls. On the other hand, the values for mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral blood flow, and brain partial pressure of O2 were significantly lower than those of normothermic controls. The heatstroke-induced hyperthermia, arterial hypotension, intracranial hypertension, cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia, and increased levels of cellular ischemia and damage markers in striatum were all significantly attenuated by prior administration of ipsapirone or ketanserin. The present results strongly suggest that previous activation of 5-HT1A receptors or antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors protects against heatstroke by reducing circulatory shock and cerebral ischemia, whereas prior antagonism of 5-HT1A receptors or activation of 5-HT2A receptors exacerbates heatstroke.
Systemic injection of the cholinergic agonist, pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, i.p.) initiates a sequence of events leading to motor limbic seizure activity. Focal injection of the excitatory amino acid antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (50 pmol-1 nmol) into the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), prior to pilocarpine injection, results in a powerful anticonvulsant action. The GABA agonist, muscimol (25-50 pmol) also afforded protection against pilocarpine-evoked convulsions when injected focally into the PPN. The results suggest that an overall inhibition of PPN output neurons is required for anticonvulsant action.
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and diabetes are both associated with a high risk of ischemic events, but the role of intensive blood pressure control in PAD has not been established.
The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes study followed 950 subjects with type 2 diabetes for 5 years; 480 of the subjects were normotensive (baseline diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg). Patients randomized to placebo (moderate blood pressure control) had a mean blood pressure of 137+/-0.7/81+/-0.3 mm Hg over the last 4 years of treatment. In contrast, patients randomized to intensive treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine had a mean 4-year blood pressure of 128+/-0.8/75+/-0.3 mm Hg (P<0.0001 compared with moderate control). PAD, which is defined as an ankle-brachial index <0.90 at the baseline visit, was diagnosed in 53 patients. In patients with PAD, there were 3 cardiovascular events (13.6%) on intensive treatment compared with 12 events (38.7%) on moderate treatment (P=0.046). After adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, an inverse relationship between ankle-brachial index and cardiovascular events was observed with moderate treatment (P=0.009), but not with intensive treatment (P=0.91). Thus, with intensive blood pressure control, the risk of an event was not increased, even at the lowest ankle-brachial index values, and was the same as in a patient without PAD.
In PAD patients with diabetes, intensive blood pressure lowering to a mean of 128/75 mm Hg resulted in a marked reduction in cardiovascular events.
Skull morphology and histology in the heterozygous offspring of a transgenic founder mouse Del1, harbouring 6 copies of deletion mutation in Col2a1 gene, were compared with those in normal siblings. On visual observation and roentgenocephalometric examination the heads of heterozygous Del1 mice were smaller than normal. Histologically the sizes of cartilaginous structures of the cranial base were reduced. Severe defects were seen in the temporomandibular joint as progressive osteoarthritic lesions. These observations elucidate the relationship between the genotype and phenotype and demonstrate that heterozygous Del1 mice are a useful model for studies on a genetic disturbance where 'clinical' manifestations are not evident until adult age.
o-Benzyl-p-chlorophenol, an aryl halide biocide, was evaluated in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in a series of subchronic and 2-year toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. Kidney was the primary target of toxicity in the 13-week gavage studies in rats and mice, with increased nephropathy noted as low as 240 mg/kg in male rats. Considering the nephropathy to be doselimiting, the chronic (2-year) study was conducted at lower doses (male rats: 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg; female rats: 60, 120, or 240 mg/kg; male and female mice: 120, 240, or 480 mg/kg; in corn oil; n = 50/group). Survival and body weights of dosed rats were similar to controls in the 2-year study. Survival of high-dose male and female mice, and body weights of all dosed male and mid- and high-dose female mice, were lower than controls. The incidence and severity of nephropathy increased with dose and length of treatment in both rats and mice. There was an increased incidence of renal tubule adenomas or carcinomas in both the mid- and high-dose male mice. Despite similar evidence of nephropathy, however, there were no increased incidences of neoplasms in female mice or in male or female rats. This study suggests therefore that while nephrotoxicity may have been a necessary component, factors other than the marked nephrotoxicity of o-benzyl-p-chlorophenol were critical to the development of renal carcinogenesis induced in only male mice.
Hallucinations on withdrawal of midazolam have been noted in intensive care patients. Isoflurane is increasingly used as an alternative drug for sedation. We report a seven-year-old child with 15% burns who, on withdrawal of isoflurane, suffered hallucinations, a generalized seizure and disorientation. The adverse symptoms occurred within hours of stopping the isoflurane and lasted for five days.
To study the case of a 2 10/12-year-old boy who had growth failure and delayed bone maturation.
We reviewed the history, which revealed that he had had polyuria, polydipsia, lack of weight gain, and frequent vomiting since the age of 5 months. On physical examination, his height was 86 cm (-1.93 standard deviation [SD]), his weight 10.5 kg (-2.67 SD), and he had motor and mental retardation. His maternal great-grandfather also had polyuria and polydipsia (but not diabetes mellitus), suggesting X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as the underlying cause. The patient underwent a water deprivation-desmopressin test. The coding region of the AVPR2 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and submitted to direct sequence analysis.
The water deprivation test confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, and administration of desmopressin did not diminish his water secretion. Direct sequencing of the AVPR2 gene revealed a novel deletion of adenine at position 222 (222delA) in exon 2. This mutation is predicted to lead to a frameshift beginning at amino acid 75 and a premature stop codon at position 115 (FS75>115X). His height and weight, as well as his motor skills, improved after initiation of therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride.
Growth delay can be associated with diabetes insipidus. The X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in this boy is caused by a novel mutation in the AVPR2 gene that is predicted to truncate the receptor protein.
Endometriosis is a disease of women where endometrial tissue is found growing at ectopic sites. While evidence suggesting a role for the ovarian hormones in endometriosis exists, no complete studies of the roles of estrogen and progesterone have heretofore been performed. Also, if estrogen has a role in the growth and/or maintenance of endometriosis, it is likely that the proestrogenic pesticide, methoxychlor (MXC), might also have such an effect. Sixty rats underwent surgery on Day 0 to induce endometriosis. On Day 21, all rats were ovariectomized. During surgery, the diameters of all endometriotic implants (which were fully developed) were measured. Starting on Day 21, groups of rats were treated daily, for 3 weeks, with (a) vehicle (b) estrone, 1 micrograms/rat, E;(c) progesterone, 2 mg/rat, P; (d) E + P, 1 micrograms + 2 mg; (e) MXC, 250 mg/kg; or (f) MXC + P, 250 mg/kg + 2 mg/rat. On Day 42, all rats were killed, and the diameters of all endometriotic sites were measured. While no differences in diameter were found across groups prior to ovariectomy, ovariectomy plus treatment altered the growth of endometriosis tissue. Progesterone and vehicle treatments produced results that were identical: regression of endometriotic sites. Both estrogen and MXC treatments maintained endometriotic site size at a level greater than that in the vehicle-treated group. The combination of progesterone with either estrone or MXC did not alter the effect of either chemical. We conclude that while estrogen promotes the growth of endometriosis, progesterone either produces regression or fails to maintain the sites. MXC, at a relatively high dose, supports the development of endometriosis. Concurrent progesterone treatment does not modulate the effects of estrone or MXC. These results suggest that exposure of women to high doses of MXC may exacerbate the development of endometriosis or contribute to its recurrence.
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme which has a crucial role in the metabolism of dopamine. It has been suggested that a common functional genetic polymorphism in the COMT gene, which results in 3 to 4-fold difference in COMT enzyme activity, may contribute to the etiology of mental disorders such as bipolar disorder and alcoholism. Since ethanol-induced euphoria is associated with the rapid release of dopamine in limbic areas, it is conceivable that subjects who inherit the allele encoding the low activity COMT variant would have a relatively low dopamine inactivation rate, and therefore would be more vulnerable to the development of ethanol dependence. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis among type 1 (late-onset) alcoholics. The COMT polymorphism was determined in two independent male late onset (type 1) alcoholic populations in Turku (n = 67) and Kuopio (n = 56). The high (H) and low (L) activity COMT genotype and allele frequencies were compared with previously published data from 3140 Finnish blood donors (general population) and 267 race- and gender-matched controls. The frequency of low activity allele (L) was markedly higher among the patients both in Turku (P = 0.023) and in Kuopio (P = 0.005) when compared with the general population. When all patients were compared with the general population (blood donors), the difference was even more significant (P = 0.0004). When genotypes of all alcoholics (n = 123) were compared with genotypes of matched controls, the odds ratio (OR) for alcoholism for those subjects having the LL genotype vs those with HH genotype was 2.51, 95% CI 1.22-5.19, P = 0.006. Also, L allele frequency was significantly higher among alcoholics when compared with controls (P = 0.009). The estimate for population etiological (attributable) fraction for the LL genotype in alcoholism was 13.3% (95% CI 2.3-25.7%). The results indicate that the COMT polymorphism contributes significantly to the development of late-onset alcoholism.
A major link between inflammation and cancer is provided by NF-kappaB transcription factors. Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice, which specifically lack IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), an activator of NF-kappaB, in hepatocytes, are unable to activate NF-kappaB in response to proinflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-alpha. Surprisingly, Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice are hypersusceptible to diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Because defective NF-kappaB activation promotes sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in cells exposed to TNF-alpha, whose expression is induced by DEN, and JNK activity is required for normal hepatocyte proliferation, we examined whether increased susceptibility to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice requires JNK activation. Hepatocytes express both JNK1 and JNK2, but previous studies indicate that JNK1 is more important for hepatocyte proliferation. We therefore investigated this hypothesis using mice homozygous for a JNK1 deficiency either in wild-type or Ikkbeta(Deltahep) backgrounds. In both cases, mice lacking JNK1 were much less susceptible to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. This impaired tumorigenesis correlated with decreased expression of cyclin D and vascular endothelial growth factor, diminished cell proliferation, and reduced tumor neovascularization. Whereas hepatocyte-specific deletion of IKKbeta augmented DEN-induced hepatocyte death and cytokine-driven compensatory proliferation, disruption of JNK1 abrogated this response. In addition to underscoring the importance of JNK1-mediated hepatocyte death and compensatory proliferation, these results strongly suggest that the control of tissue renewal through the IKK and JNK pathways plays a key role in liver carcinogenesis.
This paper describes our experience with the use of razoxane (ICRF 159), a new anti-mitotic drug, in the treatment of thirty-six patients with severe psoriasis. The drug has proven highly effective both in cutaneous and in arthropathic disease. The drug is well tolerated by patients and appears to be free of hepatotoxicity. However, it causes depression of the neutrophil leukocyte count, an effect which is entirely dose-dependent; the hazard to patients can be minimized by careful supervision of therapy.
In January 1984, an outbreak of influenza caused by A/Victoria/7/83-like virus, a new H1N1 variant, occurred in an institution for mentally handicapped children and adults. During the first 18 days of the outbreak, 35 (81%) of 43 residents in two housing modules became ill, nearly all of whom had received influenza vaccine the previous autumn. Amantadine hydrochloride prophylaxis was initiated in two other housing modules and was continued for 28 days. While factors influencing the risk of introduction and secondary spread of influenza virus were comparable in all four modules, only ten (16%) of 63 residents who received amantadine were infected, only one of whom became symptomatic. Most side effects associated with amantadine were mild, but residents with active, preexisting major-motor seizure disorders demonstrated an increase in seizure activity compared with the previous eight-month period; those who took the maximum daily dose of amantadine hydrochloride (200 mg) and those who were also taking anticonvulsants other than phenobarbital were at highest risk.
Intraspinal drug-delivery therapy has been increasingly used in patients with intractable nonmalignant pain syndromes during the past two decades. Morphine, the only FDA-approved opioid for intrathecal administration, has been the principle agent for such therapy. Although intrathecal morphine infusion can produce profound spinal analgesia, it may also cause some untoward side effects. We describe the first case of persistent hiccup caused by intrathecal morphine infusion therapy.
Tolerance to the anti-nociceptive effects of opioids develops rapidly in animals. In contrast, humans with chronic pain show little or no loss of pain relief in prospective opioid trials of 4-8 weeks duration. Employing the Brief Thermal Sensitization model to induce transient cutaneous secondary hyperalgesia, we tested the hypothesis that opioid analgesic tolerance would develop rapidly. In this outpatient randomized placebo-controlled study, subjects in the MMMMP group received two injections of subcutaneous morphine 6 mg (150 min apart) on Monday-Thursday (total 48 mg over 4 days) and matching saline placebo on Friday. Subjects in the PPPPM group received placebo on Monday-Thursday and morphine (total 12 mg) on Friday. Sixty-one healthy volunteers were enrolled; morphine side effects accounted for all nine non-completions. Compared to the first placebo day, the reduction in the area of secondary hyperalgesia on the first morphine day was significant and robust in both groups. Morphine suppression of the painfulness of skin heating and elevation of the heat pain detection threshold were also significant. During 4 days of twice-daily injections, the decline in anti-hyperalgesic effects of morphine did not reach statistical significance (p=0.06) compared to placebo. Morphine side effects did not correlate with anti-hyperalgesic effects and withdrawal symptoms did not emerge. As 4 days is the threshold for demonstrating analgesic tolerance to twice-daily morphine in animal models, a longer period of opioid exposure in healthy volunteers might be needed to detect analgesic tolerance.
Indomethacin has been shown to have adverse effects on renal function in patients with well-compensated alcoholic cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether an oral prostaglandin E1 analogue, misoprostol, could prevent this indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction.
Six patients with well-compensated alcoholic cirrhosis were studied. Renal hemodynamics and tubular function were assessed by clearance techniques before and after an oral dose of (i) 50 mg of indomethacin alone (I50), and (ii) a combination of I50 and 200 micrograms of misoprostol.
I50 produced a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate, a fall in effective renal plasma flow and an increase in renal vascular resistance. Two hundred micrograms of misoprostol was able to abolish the deleterious renal effects of indomethacin totally, yielding an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow and a decrease in renal vascular resistance as well as an increase in urinary volume and urinary sodium excretion. These beneficial effects were maximal in the hour immediately following medication, but were only transient, and this may be a limiting factor in its clinical use.
If the beneficial renal effects of misoprostol could be confirmed after chronic administration, then the vasodilatory, natriuretic and diuretic potential of 200 micrograms of misoprostol could be of potential therapeutic value in patients with well-compensated alcoholic cirrhosis who require non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy.
To determine whether keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epithelial and urothelial growth factor, ameliorates cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced cystitis in rats, KGF (5 mg/kg) was injected in rats as a single i.v. injection 24 h prior to i.p. injection of CP (200 mg/kg). Bladders were evaluated histologically 48 h after CP injection, and KGF pretreatment was found to almost completely prevent CP-induced ulcerative hemorrhagic cystitis. Urinary KGF levels were measured by ELISA, and KGF was found to be undetectable in control urine, but it was found to appear in the urine of KGF-treated rats at 8 h, with a peak concentration of approximately 10 ng/ml. Bilateral nephrectomy did not diminish the proliferative effect of KGF on urothelium, suggesting that the contribution of urinary KGF to urothelial proliferation is insignificant. In conclusion, systemic administration of KGF is protective against CP-induced cystitis. Although KGF appears in the urine, urinary KGF is not necessary for the proliferative action of KGF on urothelium.
Enteric fever affects more than 25 million people annually and results from systemic infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi or Paratyphi pathovars A, B or C(1). We conducted a genome-wide association study of 432 individuals with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever and 2,011 controls from Vietnam. We observed strong association at rs7765379 (odds ratio (OR) for the minor allele = 0.18, P = 4.5 × 10(-10)), a marker mapping to the HLA class II region, in proximity to HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1. We replicated this association in 595 enteric fever cases and 386 controls from Nepal and also in a second independent collection of 151 cases and 668 controls from Vietnam. Imputation-based fine-mapping across the extended MHC region showed that the classical HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele (OR = 0.14, P = 2.60 × 10(-11)) could entirely explain the association at rs7765379, thus implicating HLA-DRB1 as a major contributor to resistance against enteric fever, presumably through antigen presentation.
