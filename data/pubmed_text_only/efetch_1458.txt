Defective endothelium-dependent relaxation is observed in experimental and human diabetes mellitus. The nature of this defect is not fully understood but may involve decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity due to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this paper, we examine the benefits and actions of a novel NO-donating, antioxidant called 2-acetoxybenzoic acid 2-(2-nitrooxymethyl) phenyl ester, and denoted as NCX4016, on NO-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation in normal arteries exposed to acute elevations in glucose or in arteries derived from chronic diabetic animals.
Intrinsic free radical scavenging by NO-NSAIDs in solution were evaluated using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and spin trapping with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). In acute studies, normal rat aortas were exposed in tissue culture for 18 h to 5.5 mM or 40 mM in the presence or absence of NCX4016, a NO-donating NSAID unrelated to aspirin (NCX2216) or aspirin. Vascular reactivity of thoracic aortic rings to endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine in vitro was determined. For chronic hyperglycemia, diabetes was induced in rats by intravenous injection with streptozotocin. Vascular reactivity of thoracic aortic rings to endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine in vitro was determined after 8 wks in untreated animals or animals chronically-treated with NCX4016. Antioxidant efficacy in vivo was determined by measurement of plasma isoprostanes and by nuclear binding activity of NF-kappaB in nuclear fractions of aortae.
Incubation with NCX4016 and NCX2216 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of DMPO-OH formation indicating scavenging of hydroxyl radicals (HO(*)). In contrast, little efficacy to scavenge superoxide anion radicals was noted. Acute incubation of normal arteries with elevated glucose concentration caused inhibition of normal relaxation to acetylcholine. This impairment was prevented by co-incubation with NCX4106 but not by mannitol, the parent compound (aspirin) or by NCX2216. In addition, chronic treatment with NCX4016 prevented the development of defective endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. This protection did not occur as a result to any changes in blood glucose concentration or hemoglobin glycation. Treatment with NCX4016 did decrease the elevation in plasma isoprostanes and normalized the diabetes-induced increase in NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear fractions derived from aortic tissue.
Collectively, these studies suggest that antioxidant interventions using NO-donating NSAIDs may provide an important novel therapeutic strategy to protect the diabetic endothelium.
Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) regulate growth and development and enhance cellular proliferation. IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) inhibits IGF action by competitively binding IGFs that prevents their binding to the IGF cell surface receptor. Altered expression and serum levels of IGFBP-3 are associated with a number of malignancies. Study addressing the effect of IGFBP-3 gene polymorphism on bladder cancer is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of -202 A/C polymorphism of IGFBP-3 gene on development of bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and its correlation with serum concentration of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 and with clinicopathological characteristics. One single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2854744) was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RLFP) technique. One hundred and sixty-two bladder cancer patients were genotyped for this SNP. The genotypes were compared with those of a random sample of 324 age-matched controls of the general population. Serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were also determined. We found statistically significant differences in the genotypic distribution between the cases and the control subject (χ(2) = 6.43, df = 2.0, P = 0.028). Using CC genotype as a reference, the odds ratio for the subjects with AC genotype was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.27-2.84; P = 0.038). We detected a significantly decreased risk of bladder cancer associated with the AA genotype (adjusted OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.24-0.64; P = 0.001) compared with the CC genotype. This decreased risk was more pronounced for invasive bladder cancer. Age-adjusted mean serum IGFBP-3 levels were lowest in the individuals with the CC genotype. We found a positive correlation between age-adjusted serum IGFBP-3 levels and circulating IGF-1 concentrations (16% difference in IGFBP-3 in top vs. bottom tertiles of IGF-1, P for trend = 0.001), which was comparable across genotypes at the -202 IGFBP-3 locus (interaction term, F = 0.10, P = 0.87). Genetic polymorphism of the IGFBP-3 gene may be involved in the etiology of bladder TCC, and our results need further confirmation by larger studies.
Studies have shown signs of brain damage caused by different mechanisms in cocaine users. The serum neuron specific enolase and S100B protein are considered specific biochemical markers of neuronal and glial cell injury. This study aimed at comparing blood levels of S100B and NSE in chronic cocaine users and in volunteers who did not use cocaine or other illicit drugs.
Twenty subjects dependent on cocaine but not on alcohol or marijuana, and 20 non-substance using controls were recruited. Subjects were selected by consecutive and non-probabilistic sampling. Neuron specific enolase and S100B levels were determined by luminescence assay.
Cocaine users had significantly higher scores than controls in all psychiatric dimensions of the SCL-90 and had cognitive deficits in the subtest cubes of WAIS and the word span. Mean serum S100B level was 0.09 +/- 0.04 microg/l among cocaine users and 0.08 +/- 0.04 microg/l among controls. Mean serum neuron specific enolase level was 9.7 +/- 3.5 ng/l among cocaine users and 8.3 +/- 2.6 ng/l among controls.
In this first study using these specific brain damage markers in cocaine users, serum levels of S100B and neuron specific enolase were not statistically different between cocaine dependent subjects and controls.
We compared the distribution of an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the gene coding for the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in 133 Japanese sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) patients with 257 controls. The association between AD and ACE genotypes or alleles was found to be significant. The frequency of II genotypes was 1.4 times higher in AD than controls, while that of DD genotypes was only 0.4 times as high. The altered distribution of ACE alleles in patients with AD appeared to be independent of apolipoprotein E.
We had sequenced a cDNA of calcium oxalate urinary stone protein extracted with 0.1 M EDTA. cDNA sequences showed complete homology between urinary stone protein and human osteopontin (OPN, bone sialoprotein I). In the present study, we investigated the expression of OPN mRNA in the rat kidney in an experimental model of renal stone formation using glyoxylic acid and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3). In the renal stone formation model with and without renal failure, OPN mRNA was shown to be localized by in situ hybridization using an OPN cRNA probe mainly in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, and was enhanced compared with the normal control which was sporadically positive. By Northern blot analysis, the expression of OPN mRNA was shown to be increased by about 5.2-fold in the renal stone formation model and 2.3-fold in D3-administered rats compared with controls. However, no change in the expression of OPN mRNA was observed in an acute renal failure model induced by gentamicin or in rats administered glycoxylic acid alone. Therefore, the promotion of OPN mRNA expression was intrinsic to this stone formation model, and not secondary to acute renal failure because of obstruction by microcrystals in the renal tubules or gentamicin.
The effect of the enkephalinase inhibitor phosphoramidon on the withdrawal syndrome following acute and chronic morphine-induced physical dependence in mice, was investigated. Phosphoramidon administered intracerebroventricularly (50-200 micrograms) suppressed significantly the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping and wet dog shakes while forelimb shakes were potentiated in both acute and chronic morphine-dependent mice. It is suggested that increased saturation of the opioid receptors by endogenous opioid peptides following enkephalinase inhibition, might suppress the severity of the withdrawal syndrome.
Andrographolide, a bioactive diterpenoid, is identified in Andrographis paniculata. In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of andrographolide in rats and studied whether andrographolide enhances antioxidant defense in a variety of tissues and protects against carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative damage. After a single 50-mg/kg administration, the maximum plasma concentration of andrographolide was 1μM which peaked at 30min. The bioavailability of andrographolide was 1.19%. In a hepatoprotection study, rats were intragastrically dosed with 30 or 50mg/kg andrographolide for 5 consecutive days. The results showed that andrographolide up-regulated glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) catalytic and modifier subunits, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1, heme oxygenase (HO)-1, and glutathione (GSH) S-transferase (GST) Ya/Yb protein and mRNA expression in the liver, heart, and kidneys. The activity of SOD, GST, and GSH reductase was also increased in rats dosed with andrographolide (p<0.05). Immunoblot analysis and EMSA revealed that andrographolide increased nuclear Nrf2 contents and Nrf2 binding to DNA, respectively. After the 5-day andrographolide treatment, one group of animals was intraperitoneally injected with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) at day 6. Andrographolide pretreatment suppressed CCl4-induced plasma aminotransferase activity and hepatic lipid peroxidation (p<0.05). These results suggest that andrographolide is quickly absorbed in the intestinal tract in rats with a bioavailability of 1.19%. Andrographolide protects against chemical-induced oxidative damage by up-regulating the gene transcription and activity of antioxidant enzymes in various tissues.
To describe the fifth reported instance, as of February 15, 2006, of a severe interaction between simvastatin and amiodarone and hypothesize inhibition of CYP3A4 as the major mechanism.
A 72-year-old white man (178 cm, 77.2 kg) with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and mild azotemia was hospitalized on September 21, 2004, with thigh weakness, achiness, and dark urine for 7 days. Coronary artery bypass had been performed on July 7, 2004. Amiodarone 200 mg/day was started on July 10, and simvastatin 80 mg/day was initiated on August 13. Laboratory testing on the present admission included creatine kinase (CK) 19,620 U/L (reference range 60-224), blood urea nitrogen 50 mg/dL, creatinine 2.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 912 U/L (30-60), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 748 U/L (30-60), urine myoglobin 71,100 microg/L (<50), and serum myoglobin 13,877 microg/L (<110). Simvastatin and amiodarone were discontinued, and the patient was hydrated with forced alkaline diuresis. Thirteen days later, his CK was 323 U/L, creatinine 1.7 mg/dL, ALT 145 U/L, and AST 37 U/L.
Simvastatin is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and amiodarone is a recognized inhibitor of this enzyme. This may, therefore, account for the presumed drug interaction.
An objective causal assessment suggests that rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and possibly hepatotoxicity were probably related to an amiodarone-simvastatin interaction.
Autism is a behaviorally defined disorder of unknown etiology that is thought to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. High levels of homocysteine and oxidative stress are generally associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare the level of homocysteine and other biomarkers in children with autism to corresponding values in age-matched healthy children. We measured total homocysteine (tHcy), vitamin B(12), paraoxonase and arylesterase activities of human paraoxonase 1 (PON1) in plasma and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in erythrocytes from 21 children: 12 with autism (age: 8.29 +/- 2.76 years) and 9 controls (age: 8.33 +/- 1.82 years). We found statistically significant differences in tHcy levels and in arylesterase activity of PON1 in children with autism compared to the control group: 9.83 +/- 2.75 vs. 7.51 +/- 0.93 micromol/L (P < or =0.01) and 72.57 +/- 11.73 vs. 81.83 +/- 7.39 kU/L (P < or =0.005). In the autistic group there was a strong negative correlation between tHcy and GPx activity and the vitamin B(12) level was low or suboptimal. In conclusion, our study shows that in children with autism there are higher levels of tHcy, which is negatively correlated with GPx activity, low PON1 arylesterase activity and suboptimal levels of vitamin B(12).
Two injectable forms of temazepam, in 90% propylene glycol or 40% salicylic acid, were studied in volunteers, and before surgery in healthy patients. The volunteers also received two forms (capsule and elixir) by mouth. The salicylate preparation was painful on injection and both i.v. formulations caused an unacceptably high incidence of venous thrombosis. Temazepam was detected in plasma earlier following the elixir preparation than the capsule. Plasma concentrations were similar following both injectable preparations. The potency of i.v. temazepam in inducing drowsiness in patients was much less than expected and doses greater than 0.6 mg kg-1 were required to produce adequate sedation. There was a significant reduction in thiopentone induction dose in patients receiving temazepam i.v.
Therapeutic efficacy and target symptoms with clocapramine were compared with those with haloperidol by the crossover method, in a total of 26 chronic schizophrenic patients, by administration of one of the drugs for the first 14 weeks and the other for the next 14 weeks. The final global improvement rating showed no significant difference between the two groups, but clocapramine administered as first drug appeared to have a more pronounced effect than haloperidol. According to the improvement rate in psychotic symptoms, clocapramine tended to be superior to haloperidol for motor retardation, scanty speech and disturbance of thought. In addition the frequency of side-effects was lower with clocapramine than with haloperidol. Neither the side-effects nor abnormal laboratory test results were severe enough to terminate the trial. Clocapramine is considered to be equivalent or superior to haloperidol in terms of anti-psychotic effect in chronic schizophrenia, and is relatively safer than haloperidol.
Members of the SLC4 bicarbonate transporter family are involved in solute transport and pH homeostasis. Here we report that disrupting the Slc4a10 gene, which encodes the Na(+)-coupled Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchanger Slc4a10 (NCBE), drastically reduces brain ventricle volume and protects against fatal epileptic seizures in mice. In choroid plexus epithelial cells, Slc4a10 localizes to the basolateral membrane. These cells displayed a diminished recovery from an acid load in KO mice. Slc4a10 also was expressed in neurons. Within the hippocampus, the Slc4a10 protein was abundant in CA3 pyramidal cells. In the CA3 area, propionate-induced intracellular acidification and attenuation of 4-aminopyridine-induced network activity were prolonged in KO mice. Our data indicate that Slc4a10 is involved in the control of neuronal pH and excitability and may contribute to the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid. Hence, Slc4a10 is a promising pharmacological target for the therapy of epilepsy or elevated intracranial pressure.
We measured total and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF, rCBF) and cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) of oxygen (O2), glucose (G), and lactate (L) levels for 4 h after 16 min global brain ischemia in rhesus monkeys with and without post-insult thiopental therapy. Eleven monkeys weighing 4-5 kg anesthetized with 1 percent halothane, 66 percent nitrous oxide and 33 percent oxygen, were subjected to 16 min global brain ischemia by a combination of trimethaphan hypotension (to a mean arterial pressure of 50 torr) and a high pressure (1500 torr) neck tourniquet. Post-ischemia, 7 monkeys were untreated (controls) and 4 received thiopental 90 mg/kg infused intravenously over 60 min, beginning at 5 min post-ischemia. Total CBF and rCBF were measured by continuous monitoring of cerebral venous (torcula) and parietal-occipital (external scintillation) 133Xe activity, respectively, after intra-innominate artery injection of 500 micronCi 133Xe in saline. In control monkeys, hyperemia in rCBF, but not in total CBF was observed at 6-7 min post-ischemia, whereas both total CBF and rCBF increased in thiopental treated monkeys. The hyperemia in thiopental treated monkeys coincided with an increase in CMRG without a proportional increase in CMRO2 or lactate levels. Indeed, CMRO2 was depressed in the first 30 min post-ischemia. At 30 min post-ischemia, CMRO2 rose to twofold greater than pre-ischemia in control monkeys, but only to pre-ischemic levels in thiopental treated monkeys. The data suggest that thiopental therapy improves distribution of brain blood flow and brain glucose uptake early post-ischemia and depresses CMRO2 later post-ischemia.
Articular chondrocytes exist in an environment lacking in oxygen and nutrients due to the avascular nature of cartilage. The main source of metabolic energy is glucose, which is taken up by glucose transporters (GLUTs). In diseased joints, oxygen tensions and glucose availability alter as a result of inflammation and changes in vascularisation. Accordingly, in this study we examined the effects of hypoxia and the hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)) on glucose transport in equine chondrocytes and compared expression of the hypoxia responsive GLUT1 gene in normal and diseased cartilage. Monolayers of equine chondrocytes were exposed to 20% O(2), 1% O(2), CoCl(2) (75 microM), or a combination of 1% O(2) and CoCl(2). Glucose uptake was measured using 2-deoxy-D-[2,6-(3)H] glucose. GLUT1 protein and mRNA expression were determined by FACS analysis and qPCR, respectively. GLUT1 mRNA expression in normal and diseased cartilage was analyzed using explants derived from normal, OA, and OCD cartilage. Chondrocytes under hypoxic conditions exhibited a significantly increased glucose uptake as well as upregulated GLUT1 protein expression. GLUT1 mRNA expression significantly increased in combined hypoxia-CoCl(2) treatment. Analysis of clinical samples indicated a significant reduction in GLUT1 mRNA in OA samples. In OCD samples GLUT1 expression also decreased but did not reach statistical significance. The increase in glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression under hypoxic conditions confirms that hypoxia alters the metabolic requirements of chondrocytes. The altered GLUT1 mRNA expression in diseased cartilage with significance in OA suggests that reduced GLUT1 may contribute to the failure of OA cartilage repair.
The objective of this study was to determine whether Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has a role in alcohol-mediated acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity. TLR4 is involved in the inflammatory response to endotoxin. Others have found that ethanol-mediated liver disease is decreased in C3H/HeJ mice, which have a mutated TLR4 resulting in a decreased response to endotoxin compared with endotoxin-responsive mice. In the present study, short-term (1 wk) pretreatment with ethanol plus isopentanol, the predominant alcohols in alcoholic beverages, caused no histologically observed liver damage in either C3H/HeJ mice or endotoxin-responsive C3H/HeN mice, despite an increase in nitrotyrosine levels in the livers of C3H/HeN mice. In C3H/HeN mice pretreated with the alcohols, subsequent exposure to APAP caused a transient decrease in liver nitrotyrosine formation, possibly due to competitive interaction of peroxynitrite with APAP producing 3-nitroacetaminophen. Treatment with APAP alone resulted in steatosis in addition to congestion and necrosis in both C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice, but the effects were more severe in endotoxin-responsive C3H/HeN mice. In alcohol-pretreated endotoxin-responsive C3H/HeN mice, subsequent exposure to APAP resulted in further increases in liver damage, including severe steatosis, associated with elevated plasma levels of TNF-alpha. In contrast, alcohol pretreatment of C3H/HeJ mice caused little to no increase in APAP hepatotoxicity and no increase in plasma TNF-alpha. Portal blood endotoxin levels were very low and were not detectably elevated by any of the treatments. In conclusion, this study implicates a role of TLR4 in APAP-mediated hepatotoxicity.
Oral cancer, originating from smoking-induced lesions of the basal cells in the complex stratified oral epithelium, is difficult to treat. Early detection of premalignant lesions, e.g., leukoplakia, has suggested the possibility of chemopreventive measures, such as topical application of antimutagenic/antiproliferative dietary or pharmaceutical agents. As an extension of a study in human oral epithelial cell monolayers, we determined the carcinogen, i.e., benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), transport, bioactivation, and DNA binding in a bioengineered human gingival epithelial tissue construct and the chemopreventive effects of dietary polyphenols. Short-term experiments showed that both types of compounds can traverse this tissue as well as be effectively taken up by the tissue. The model cigarette smoke carcinogen BaP very slowly, but to a great extent, accumulated in the tissue with maximal uptake at 24 h. Such exposure clearly resulted in DNA binding of BaP by the tissue. This DNA binding was associated with BaP-induced CYP1B1 as well as CYP1A1 expression, as evidenced by mRNA measurements. Cotreatment of the oral tissue with dietary polyphenols, including resveratrol and quercetin, and BaP, resulted in significant inhibition of the BaP-DNA binding. Using fluorescence microscopy as well as simultaneous autoradiography, we also demonstrated that quercetin indeed penetrates the entire stratified tissue layer, but that quercetin was also oxidized within the cells. Thus, this bioengineered oral tissue construct opens up improved ways of understanding and preventing/treating smoking-induced oral cancer.
Emodin is a component from traditional Chinese herbal medicines. We focused on investigating whether emodin possesses distinct anti-inflammatory activity on a non-infectious mouse model of asthma, and we aimed to elucidate its involvement with the NF-κB pathway. BALB/c mice that were sensitized and challenged to ovalbumin were treated with emodin (40 mg/kg) 1h before they were challenged with OVA. Our study demonstrated that emodin inhibited OVA-induced increases in eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and reduced serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, IgG, and IgG1. Histological studies demonstrated that emodin substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue and mucus hyper-secretion by goblet cells in the airway. Furthermore, pretreatment with emodin resulted in a significant reduction in mRNA expression of acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), chitinase 3-like protein 4 (Ym2) and Muc5ac in lung tissues and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. These findings suggest that emodin may effectively delay the progression of airway inflammation and could be used as a therapy for patients with allergic airway inflammation.
It has been indicated that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the receptor for PGE2 (EP receptor) are key factors contributing to the facilitated generation of nociception. This study was designed to investigate the roles of PGE2 and EP1 receptors in the spinal cord in the nociceptive transmission, using behavioral and intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) assays and in situ hybridization. Experiments were conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats. In behavioral assays, withdrawal thresholds to mechanical stimuli were evaluated using von Frey filament. The effect of an intrathecally administered selective EP1 antagonist, 6-[(2S,3S)-3-(4-chloro-2-methylphenylsulfonylaminomethyl)-bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-yl]-5Z-hexenoic acid (ONO-8711), on the intrathecal PGE2-induced hyperalgesia was examined. In [Ca2+]i assays, we measured [Ca2+]i in the dorsal horn of spinal cord slices and examined the effects of PGE2 and ONO-8711 perfusion on the [Ca2+]i changes. In situ hybridization using EP1 digoxigenin probe was performed on the slice sections of the lumbar spinal cord and bilateral L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglions (DRGs). Mechanical hyperalgesia was observed after intrathecal PGE2 administration. Intrathecal administration of ONO-8711 attenuated the PGE2-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Perfusion of ONO-8711 markedly suppressed PGE2-induced [Ca2+]i increment in laminae II-VI in dorsal horn of the spinal cord slice. Moreover, in situ hybridization revealed EP1 hybridization signals in the DRG neurons, but not in the spinal cord. The results of this study suggested that spinal PGE2 activates the EP1 receptors existing on the central terminals of primary afferents, subsequently increasing in [Ca2+]i in the spinal dorsal horn, which are involved in the mechanisms of spinal PGE2-induced nociceptive transmission.
Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are thought of as chaperones of morphologic development of cells and organisms, and believed to be closely related to normal and abnormal embryonic development. Previous studies only focused on a small number of HSPs and their relationships with embryogenesis, and roles of most HSPs in normal and abnormal embryonic development remain unclear. The present study detected expression of sHsps, Hsp40 and Hsp60 in normal and abnormal development of embryonic forelimbs in all-trans retinoic acid (atRA)-induced phocomelic, oligodactylic and atRA-induced abnormal limb bud development models in mice ex vivo. It was found that 17 Hsps of the three families were expressed in embryonic limb bud tissue of normal mice, though the expression patterns were different, showing a phase correlation with the development of embryo. There was a difference in the expression pattern and mRNA abundance of most genes between the atRA-indcued limb abnormal development model groups and the control group. Most members of the three families may play a stress-protective role in atRA-induced abnormal limb development, and abnormal expression of some genes (Hsp25, HspB2, HspB3, HspB7, Hsp20, HspB9, HspB10 and Hsp40) may be related to atRA-induced phocomelic and other abnormalities.
mHR23B encodes one of the two mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23, a ubiquitin-like fusion protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Part of mHR23B is complexed with the XPC protein, and this heterodimer functions as the main damage detector and initiator of global genome NER. While XPC defects exist in humans and mice, mutations for mHR23A and mHR23B are not known. Here, we present a mouse model for mHR23B. Unlike XPC-deficient cells, mHR23B(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts are not UV sensitive and retain the repair characteristics of wild-type cells. In agreement with the results of in vitro repair studies, this indicates that mHR23A can functionally replace mHR23B in NER. Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development. This function may involve regulation of protein stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is not or only in part compensated for by mHR23A.
Since the registration of sumatriptan (Imigran) in May 1991, the Netherlands Centre for Monitoring of Adverse Reactions to Drugs received 13 reports of substernal chest tightness or pain attributed to its use. These concerned 11 women and two men with an average age of 41 years, who developed angina-like symptoms mostly within one hour after oral or subcutaneous administration. Electrocardiography (in three patients) and echocardiography (in one patient), performed after resolution of the symptoms, were normal. With the exception of one patient, none had experienced such symptoms before. Although sumatriptan is an effective anti-migrainous drug, cautious use is strongly advised. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease or variant angina pectoris.
The present study investigated the effect of ebselen (EB) against hyperglycemia induced by the organophosphate (OPI) diazinon (DI) in rats. The insulin-mimetic properties of EB were investigated in vitro with the aim of better understanding the hypoglycemic effect of this compound. The protective effect of EB against pancreatic and hepatic damage caused by DI in rats was also appraised. In the in vivo experiments, rats were pre-treated with a single injection of EB (50mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.). Afterward, animals were treated with a single injection of DI (200 mg/kg, i.p.). The parameters indicative of pancreatic and hepatic damage such as, serum amylase, lipase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities as well as serum glucose levels, hepatic glycogen content and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity were determined. EB pre-treatment was effective in reducing serum amylase, lipase, AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH activities, protecting against pancreatic and hepatic damage. EB reduced hyperglycemia and increased hepatic glycogen content in animals exposed to DI. In the in vitro assays, EB (150 μM) or insulin (IN 10 μM, positive control) was incubated with either skeletal muscle or hepatic tissue with the aim of measuring glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis and glycogen breakdown. EB increased the glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis and inhibited glycogen breakdown in a similar way to IN. In conclusion, EB, possibly through its insulin-mimetic action, protected against pancreatic and hepatic damage caused by DI in rats.
Methoxychlor (MXC) is an organochlorine pesticide used against pests that attack crops, vegetables, and livestock. MXC inhibits growth and induces atresia (death) of mouse ovarian antral follicles in vitro. Since several studies indicate that many chemicals act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway, the current study tested the hypothesis that MXC binds to the AHR to inhibit growth and induce atresia of antral follicles. The data indicate that MXC binds to AHR. Further, a relatively high dose of MXC (100μg/ml) inhibits growth and induces atresia in both wild-type (WT) and AHR null (AHRKO) follicles, whereas a lower dose of MXC (10μg/ml) inhibits growth and induces atresia in WT, but not in AHRKO follicles. These data indicate that AHR deletion partially protects antral follicles from MXC induced slow growth and atresia. Collectively, these data show that MXC may act through the AHR pathway to inhibit follicle growth and induce atresia in antral follicles of the ovary.
A patient with Parkinson's disease taking levodopa/carbidopa, selegiline, buproprion, aspirin and niacin had decreased rigidity and bradykinesia when his niacin dose was steadily escalated for treatment of high triglycerides, but ultimately the patient could not tolerate niacin because of severe nightmares and skin rash. If further research can reproduce this patient's initial beneficial experience while avoiding the adverse effects, niacin could be a useful adjunctive agent for Parkinson's disease, either population-wide or in a pharmacogenomically defined set of responders.
The use of baclofen, a structural analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), is described in the treatment of a patient with tardive dystonia. The patient, a woman with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, developed tardive dystonia after 8 weeks of haloperidol therapy and experienced complete remission of her dystonia while taking baclofen 60 mg/day. This case suggests that baclofen may facilitate remission of tardive dystonia in some cases and provides a basis for further investigation.
The long-term prognosis of furosemide-associated nephrocalcinosis in the infant is still unclear. Although discontinuation of the diuretic often results in radiological resolution of the calcifications, functional abnormalities may persist. The natural history of the renal histopathology of these patients is yet unknown. In the present study we investigated the histological long-term outcome of furosemide-induced nephrocalcinosis in the young rat. Thirty-six weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: A controls, B furosemide given for 8 weeks, and C furosemide given for 2 weeks followed by 6 weeks of observation. Metabolic studies at the end of the experiment demonstrated a significant diuretic and natriuretic effect in group B. Kidney histology showed nephrocalcinosis scores (mean +/- SD) of 0.0 +/- 0.0 in A, 2.6 +/- 1.5 in B, and 0.8 +/- 0.6 in C, with B significantly higher than A and C, and C greater than A. Kidney calcium content in B (3,421.9 +/- 2,558.7 micrograms/g dry tissue) was significantly greater than in A (310.4 +/- 21.3) and C (1470.1 +/- 932.2). Another group of 6 rats receiving 2 weeks treatment of furosemide showed a nephrocalcinosis score of 2.2 +/- 1.5, not different from group B, and an additional group of 6 rats treated with furosemide for 2 weeks and observed for another 12 weeks showed a score of 1.3 +/- 0.4, not different from group C. We conclude that most of the renal calcifications induced by furosemide occur during the early days of treatment and that up to 12 weeks after discontinuation of the diuretic, the resolution of the calcifications is only partial.
Using a regrowth-delay assay, we investigated structure/activity relationships for the enhancement by electron-affinic agents of the anti-tumour effect of the nitrosourea CCNU against the KHT sarcoma in C3H mice. A series of neutral 2-nitroimidazoles similar in electron affinity but varying in octanol/water partition coefficient (PC) over 4 orders of magnitude (0.016- greater than 200, Misonidazole = 0.43) were examined at a fixed dose of 2.5 mmol/kg. A parabolic (quadratic) dependence of activity on log PC was observed. Analogues more hydrophilic than misonidazole (MISO) were inactive as were those with very high PCs (greater than 20). Those with PC 0.43--20 were usually more active than MISO, some considerably so. The fairly lipophilic 5-nitroimidazoles nimorazole and metronidazole (METRO) had similar activity to MISO, despite their reduced electron affinity. Two basic 2-nitroimidazoles more efficient as radiosensitizers in vitro likewise showed activity comparable to MISO. We also investigated several agents more electron-affinic than MISO, including some non-nitro compounds. Most were inactive at maximum tolerated doses, but nitrofurazone showed reasonable activity. Sensitizer dose-response curves were obtained for MISO, METRO and two of the most effective agents, benznidazole (Ro 07-1051) and Ro 07-1902. The two latter agents were both considerably more active than MISO at low doses (0.1--0.9 mmol/kg). These studies indicate that the structural features of electron-affinic agents responsible for the enhancement of KHT tumour response to CCNU, are quite different from those affecting radiosensitization, lipophilicity being particularly important. The microsomal enzyme-inhibitor SKF 525A increased the anti-tumour effect of CCNU, suggesting inhibition of CCNU metabolism as one possible mechanism contributing to chemosensitization by lipophilic electron-affinic agents in mice.
