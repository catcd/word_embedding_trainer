Three peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are expressed during most of the developmental stages in the schistosome. Prx-1 is localized on the surface of the schistosomula and adults of Schistosoma japonicum, while Prx-2 is localized in the sub-tegumental tissues, parenchyma, vitelline glands, and gut epithelium, but not on the surface of the worms. We applied RNA interference techniques to suppress the specific genes of S. japonicum Prxs. Schistosomula of S. japonicum were cultured together with long-dsRNA encoding Prx-1 and Prx-2 of S. japonicum (the soaking method). The transcription level of each Prx gene was reduced by an RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated effect specifically. Although neither Prx was the essential protein for survival of S. japonicum schistosomula, Prx-1 dsRNA-treated larvae were susceptible to hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, these larvae were also susceptible to t-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene-hydroperoxide. However, the knockdown of neither Prx-1 nor Prx-2 influenced the resistance against nitric oxide generated from DETA/NO. Prx-1 may work as a scavenger against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated outside of the schistosomes to prevent the oxidation of the bodies and/or the attack by immune cells producing the ROS. These findings suggest that Prx-1 may become a novel target of drugs and vaccines for schistosomiasis.
This report describes two patients with germ cell tumors who underwent tandem autologous peripheral stem cell transplants. The chemotherapy consisted of high-dose carboplatin and etoposide. Both patients developed chemotherapy-related toxicities, which included nephrotoxicity in one case and febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, ototoxicity and mucositis in both. During the second transplant, both patients received amifostine 15 min before and 2 h after each dose of carboplatin. The patients had less mucositis and nephrotoxicity. The duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was less in both cases resulting in a decreased use of antibiotics and platelet transfusions. These cases suggest that the use of amifostine may be of benefit in minimizing toxicities associated with high-dose chemotherapy.
An early full-term pregnancy is protective against mammary cancer in both humans and rodents. Treating rats with two hormones of pregnancy, estradiol and progesterone, for 5 weeks renders the rat mammary glands refractory to carcinogenesis. Our objectives was to determine if a shortened regimen (3 weeks) would be as effective as the 5-week regimen and to determine if the mammary gland was vulnerable to carcinogenic insult during the hormone treatments. We also examined cancers that survived the chemopreventive regimen to see if those tumors were particularly aggressive compared to control tumors (i.e., less differentiated, estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha)-negative or harbored mutations in Ha-ras). In the first experiment, Lewis rats were injected with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 50 days of age. At 60 days of age, the rats were either mated and allowed to nurse their young for 3 weeks, treated with hormone vehicle for 5 weeks, or 17 beta-estradiol (E, 20 micrograms) and progesterone (P, 4 mg) 5 times per week for 3 or 5 weeks. All the rats exposed to MNU but not estradiol and progesterone developed multiple mammary cancers. Pregnancy reduced multiplicity to 0.40 cancers/rat. Treatments of estradiol and progesterone for 3 or 5 weeks reduced cancer multiplicity and increased latency to a similar degree as pregnancy. Mammary cancers from each group displayed a similar spectra of histologic class, estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) content and Ha-ras mutation status. In the second experiment, 50-day-old rats were treated for five weeks with either estradiol and progesterone or vehicle as above beginning at 60 days of age and treated with MNU at 50, 64, 78 or 92 days of age. In each case, estradiol and progesterone treatments resulted in significantly reduced mammary tumor frequency. These results demonstrate that a three-week regimen of estradiol and progesterone can protect the mammary gland from chemically-induced carcinogenesis even when carcinogen exposure occurs concomitant with estradiol and progesterone stimulation.
Mefloquine is an effective antimalarial that can cause adverse neurological events including headache, nausea, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety and depression. In this study, we examined the oxidative stress response in primary rat cortical neurons treated with mefloquine by quantifying oxidative stress markers glutathione (GSH) and F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-isoPs). Furthermore, we examined whether mefloquine induces synaptodendritic degeneration of primary rat cortical neurons. GSH was quantified in cortical neurons after 24-h treatment with mefloquine (0, 1, 5, 10 microM) using monochlorobimane. F(2)-isoPs were quantified in cortical neurons after 24-h treatment with mefloquine (0, 1, 5, 10 microM) using a stable isotope dilution method with detection by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and selective ion monitoring. The concentration dependent decrease in GSH and the concomitant increase of F(2)-isoPs indicates the presence of oxidative stress in primary rat cortical neurons treated with mefloquine. Following a 24-h treatment with mefloquine, primary rat cortical neurons (0, 5, 10 microM) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Images from eight optical sections covering a distance of 2.88 microm on the z-axis were acquired using a confocal laser scanning unit. Traced images were analyzed with NeuroExplorer, a neurophysiological data analysis package. Mefloquine induces a concentration dependent decrease in the number of spines per neuron and the spine density, suggesting that mefloquine induced oxidative stress may be associated with the synaptodendritic degeneration. Together with previous work, there is strong evidence that a relationship exists between calcium homeostasis disruption, ER stress response, the oxidative stress response, and neurodegeneration. Understanding how oxidative stress alters the morphology of cortical neurons treated with mefloquine will provide further insight into the mechanism(s) related to clinically observed adverse neurological events.
The authors report a case of urinary incontinence (UI) that occurred in a woman after administration of venlafaxine. UI resolved after discontinuation of the drug and did not reappear after switching to sertraline therapy. A 56-year-old white woman with a diagnosis of reactive depression developed severe UI after a 30 days' treatment with venlafaxine 75 mg/day. Symptoms resolved without consequence 48 hours after discontinuation of venlafaxine. The patient was then treated with sertraline without experiencing any incontinence episodes. Urinary incontinence is an important medical condition with clinical and social implications. Further studies need to be carried out to clarify the pharmacologic differences between dual and selective 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors on lower urinary tract function.
The mixture of the two pentacyclic triterpenes alpha-amyrin and beta-amyrin, isolated from the resin of Protium kleinii and given by intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral (p.o.) routes, caused dose-related and significant antinociception against the visceral pain in mice produced by i.p. injection of acetic acid. Moreover, i.p., p.o., intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), or intrathecal (i.t.) administration of alpha,beta-amyrin inhibited both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of the overt nociception caused by intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of formalin. Likewise, alpha,beta-amyrin given by i.p., p.o., i.t., or i.c.v. routes inhibits the neurogenic nociception induced by capsaicin. Moreover, i.p. treatment with alpha,beta-amyrin was able to reduce the nociception produced by 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) and by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or the hyperalgesia caused by glutamate. On the other hand, in contrast to morphine, alpha,beta-amyrin failed to cause analgesia in thermal models of pain. The antinociception caused by the mixture of compounds seems to involve mechanisms independent of opioid, alpha-adrenergic, serotoninergic, and nitrergic system mediation, since it was not affected by naloxone, prazosin, yohimbine, DL-p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester, or L-arginine. Interestingly, the i.p. administration of alpha,beta-amyrin reduced the mechanical hyperalgesia produced by i.pl. injection of carrageenan, capsaicin, bradykinin, substance P, prostaglandin E2, 8-Br-cAMP, and TPA in rats. However, the mixture of compounds failed to alter the binding sites of [3H]bradykinin, [3H]resiniferatoxin, or [3H]glutamate in vitro. It is concluded that the mixture of triterpene alpha-amyrin and beta-amyrin produced consistent peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal antinociception in rodents, especially when assessed in inflammatory models of pain. The mechanisms involved in their action are not completely understood but seem to involve the inhibition of protein kinase A- and protein kinase C-sensitive pathways.
Human intrastriatal fetal allografts survive over long periods of time in the brains of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and integrate into host circuitry. However, some grafted patients with a prior history of levodopa-induced dyskinesias have developed off-medication dyskinesias and dystonias following allografting whose mechanism remains poorly understood. The authors present single-unit discharge characteristics in the external and internal globus pallidus (GPe and GPi) in an awake patient with PD undergoing microelectrode-guided surgery for pallidal deep brain stimulation, 10 years following bilateral intraputamenal fetal mesencephalic allografting in an NIH-funded protocol.
Pallidal single-unit activity at 'rest' and during active movement was evaluated and compared with data sets from 13 PD patients in the 'off-medication' state and from one non-dyskinetic PD patient in the 'on-medication' state.
Analysis of firing rate, bursting discharge and oscillatory activity showed that the graft corrected some, but not all, of the abnormalities associated with the off-medication state. Additionally, in the transplanted patient, voluntary hand movement produced a marked reduction in pallidal discharge rate at multiple GPi recording sites, which was not observed during active movement in other patients. These findings are consistent with a persistent effect of transplanted dopamine cells on basal ganglia outflow and suggest a mechanism for the graft-induced dystonic phenotype.
To report a patient with myalgia and cramps possibly induced by the antimigrainous agent zolmitriptan.
A 27-year-old woman with episodes of common migraine developed cramps and generalized myalgia after the use of intranasal zolmitriptan 5 mg to treat 3 episodes of migraine. This side effect had not occurred with oral zolmitriptan 2.5 mg.
Myalgia and cramps should be considered a possible dose-dependent adverse effect of zolmitriptan.
Aggressive behavior was produced in rats by administration of apomorphine (APO) 20 mg/kg ip. Serotonin (5-HT) agonists, L-tryptophan or 5-hydroxytryptophan and a MAO inhibitor, pargyline, suppressed the APO-induced aggressiveness. However, cyproheptadine was the only one of four 5-HT antagonists used which potentiated the aggressive behavior. Cyproheptadine, metergoline and PCPA released aggressiveness in rats pretreated with a subthreshold dose of APO. Cholinomimetics (pilocarpine, oxytremorine and physostigmine) completely blocked APO induced aggressiveness while cholinolytics (atropine and scopolamine) partially suppressed the inhibiting effect of pilocarpine on aggressive behavior. The results obtained suggest the existence of an interaction between serotonergic, cholinergic systems and dopaminergic system in apomorphine-induced aggressiveness in rats.
To determine patient preference of and ocular discomfort with fixed combination brinzolamide/timolol compared with fixed combination dorzolamide/timolol.
In a prospective, double-masked, randomized, active-controlled, crossover, multicenter study, patients received 1 drop of brinzolamide/timolol and dorzolamide/timolol in both eyes on consecutive days in random order. Ocular discomfort was rated 1 minute after instillation of each medication, and preference was noted on Day 2. Adverse events, if any, were solicited at each visit.
127 subjects with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Of the 106 subjects who expressed a drug preference, 79.2% preferred brinzolamide/timolol (p < 0.0001). Ocular discomfort scores were significantly higher with dorzolamide/timolol than brinzolamide/timolol (2.9 vs 1.4, respectively; p < 0.0001). Significantly more patients reported ocular pain and discomfort after dorzolamide/timolol instillation and transient blurred vision after brinzolamide/timolol instillation.
Patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma preferred the brinzolamide/timolol fixed combination over the dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination. This is likely due to the greater ocular discomfort associated with dorzolamide/timolol. The differences in preference, discomfort, and adverse events are likely attributable to formulation differences given the similarities of the active ingredients. Stronger patient preference for brinzolamide/timolol may lead to better therapeutic compliance.
We describe the case of a 46-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis who developed a severe reaction to sulfasalazine, characterized by dysphasia, seizures, rash and the development of strongly positive pANCA (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies). Her condition improved spontaneously upon withdrawal of sulfasalazine. Dysphasia has not been reported as a side effect of sulfasalazine.
The effects of S-methylmethionine sulfonium chloride (MMSC, vitamin U) on aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic hyperlipidemia in rats were investigated. We found that repeated oral administration of MMSC (dose: daily 1000 mg/kg) exhibited significant amelioration of plasma chloresterol and phospholipids levels. Also, the treatment improved nephrotic syndrome itself by producing an increase of urinary volume and a decrease of urinary protein excretion. The results suggest that MMSC may be useful as single or combined therapy for human nephrotic syndrome and its related hyperlipidemia as a safety drug.
We report the case of two patients suffered from cholestatic jaundice occurred 3-4 weeks after starting ticlopidine therapy. In both cases the diagnosis was made by ruling out any other known cause of acute hepatitis or cholestasis. One patient underwent liver biopsy, which showed a typical intralobular cholestatic pattern and a slight lymphocytic infiltration of the portal tracts. The other patient, a 29 year-old woman, was taking ticlopidine as the sole drug, further to an ischemic stroke occurred while she was taking oral contraceptives; she presented a diffuse itchy dermatitis, fever and slight eosinophilia besides cholestasis. In both patients ticlopidine was discontinued and liver tests returned to normal values within 4-8 weeks; no rechallenge was attempted and ticlopidine was replaced with another antiplatelet drug. To the best of our knowledge 19 cases of ticlopidine-related cholestatic disease have been described so far in the literature. Its pathogenesis is still unknown, although some clinical findings and experimental results from patients with acute enteropathy or agranulocytosis induced by ticlopidine suggest that the drug may act through a toxic mechanism, perhaps mediated by prostaglandins.
Both oxidative stress and endotoxins mediated immunological reactions play a major role in the progression of alcoholic hepatic fibrosis. Ascorbic acid has been reported to reduce alcohol-induced toxicity and ascorbic acid levels are reduced in alcoholics. Hence, we investigated the hepatoprotective action of ascorbic acid in the reversal of alcohol-induced hepatic fibrosis in male guinea pigs (n = 36), and it was compared with the animals abstenting from alcohol treatment. In comparison with the alcohol abstention group, there was a reduction in the activities of toxicity markers and levels of lipid and protein peroxidation products, expression of α-SMA, caspase-3 activity and mRNA levels of CYP2E1, TGF-β(1), TNF-α and α(1)(I) collagen in liver of the ascorbic acid-supplemented group. The ascorbic acid content in liver was significantly reduced in the alcohol-treated guinea pigs. But it was reversed to normal level in the ascorbic acid-supplemented group. The anti-fibrotic action of ascorbic acid in the rapid regression of alcoholic liver fibrosis may be attributed to decrease in the oxidative stress, hepatic stellate cells activation, cytotoxicity and mRNA expression of fibrotic genes CYP2E1, TGF-β(1), TNF-α and α(1) (I) collagen in hepatic tissues.
Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is characterized by a substantial reduction in prenatal human brain growth without alteration of the cerebral architecture and is caused by biallelic mutations in genes coding for a subset of centrosomal proteins. Although at least three of these proteins have been implicated in centrosome duplication, the nature of the centrosome dysfunction that underlies the neurodevelopmental defect in MCPH is unclear. Here we report a homozygous MCPH-causing mutation in human CEP63. CEP63 forms a complex with another MCPH protein, CEP152, a conserved centrosome duplication factor. Together, these two proteins are essential for maintaining normal centrosome numbers in cells. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that CEP63 and CEP152 co-localize in a discrete ring around the proximal end of the parental centriole, a pattern specifically disrupted in CEP63-deficient cells derived from patients with MCPH. This work suggests that the CEP152-CEP63 ring-like structure ensures normal neurodevelopment and that its impairment particularly affects human cerebral cortex growth.
Nicardipine-induced bradycardia has been reported in experimental animals but not in clinical patients. We report a clinical case of unexpected bradycardia caused by nicardipine. The mechanism of this bradycardia was not clear, and depression of sympathetic tone by epidural anesthesia, hypothermia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation might have been contributory.
We performed a genome-wide association study of melanoma in a discovery cohort of 2,168 Australian individuals with melanoma and 4,387 control individuals. In this discovery phase, we confirm several previously characterized melanoma-associated loci at MC1R, ASIP and MTAP-CDKN2A. We selected variants at nine loci for replication in three independent case-control studies (Europe: 2,804 subjects with melanoma, 7,618 control subjects; United States 1: 1,804 subjects with melanoma, 1,026 control subjects; United States 2: 585 subjects with melanoma, 6,500 control subjects). The combined meta-analysis of all case-control studies identified a new susceptibility locus at 1q21.3 (rs7412746, P = 9.0 × 10(-11), OR in combined replication cohorts of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.95)). We also show evidence suggesting that melanoma associates with 1q42.12 (rs3219090, P = 9.3 × 10(-8)). The associated variants at the 1q21.3 locus span a region with ten genes, and plausible candidate genes for melanoma susceptibility include ARNT and SETDB1. Variants at the 1q21.3 locus do not seem to be associated with human pigmentation or measures of nevus density.
The cardiovascular and adrenergic responses to cigarette smoking during acute selective and non-selective beta adrenoceptor blockade were studied in seven young healthy volunteers in a double blind cross-over fashion. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, forearm blood flow and plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline were determined before and during the terminal 5 min period of 15 min smoking test. During smoking, plasma concentrations of adrenaline increased markedly and evenly by approximately 0.3 ng/ml in all three experimental sessions. Plasma concentrations of noradrenaline remained unchanged. Propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, caused a marked rise in diastolic and mean blood pressure and forearm vascular resistance during smoking. This response was not seen in the control series or after selective beta-1 blockage with atenolol. This difference is attributable to propranolol's blockade of adrenaline's vasodilating effect mediated by beta-2 receptors in the resistance vessels. Furthermore, atenolol attenuated the systolic blood pressure and tachycardiac responses induced by cigarette smoking by comparison with placebo. This study suggests that selective beta-1 blockers are preferable in the management of patients who are habitual smokers.
More than 1,000 susceptibility loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common variants; however, the specific genes and full allelic spectrum of causal variants underlying these findings have not yet been defined. Here we used pooled next-generation sequencing to study 56 genes from regions associated with Crohn's disease in 350 cases and 350 controls. Through follow-up genotyping of 70 rare and low-frequency protein-altering variants in nine independent case-control series (16,054 Crohn's disease cases, 12,153 ulcerative colitis cases and 17,575 healthy controls), we identified four additional independent risk factors in NOD2, two additional protective variants in IL23R, a highly significant association with a protective splice variant in CARD9 (P < 1 × 10(-16), odds ratio ≈ 0.29) and additional associations with coding variants in IL18RAP, CUL2, C1orf106, PTPN22 and MUC19. We extend the results of successful GWAS by identifying new, rare and probably functional variants that could aid functional experiments and predictive models.
A 60 year old woman with idiopathic Parkinson's disease had been prescribed thioridazine for schizophrenia. Five months after this was stopped, Sinemet also considered of dubious therapeutic value, was withdrawn. One week later she developed features of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) accompanied by myoglobinuric renal failure. Post-mortem examination confirmed Lewy body degeneration in the substantia nigra. It is proposed that NMS may be caused by levodopa withdrawal in Parkinson's disease, and that it is withdrawal of dopaminergic drive that causes the syndrome.
Diazepam was administered to Swiss-Webster mice for 53 days as a mixture of drug in laboratory chow, leading to consumption as high as 1000 mg/kg/day. Low plasma concentrations of diazepam, but very high levels (generally between 5,000 and 10,000 ng/ml) of the active metabolites nordiazepam and oxazepam, were found. Animals appeared healthy throughout drug administration, but some died because of apparent drug-induced aggression. Withdrawal was precipitated by omitting drug from the food. The behavior and physiological state of each animal were observed in detail during treatment and withdrawal phases. Tests that showed stable results in control animals and changes during abstinence were used to measure the withdrawal syndrome. These changes included piloerection, tremor, pelvic elevation and tail elevation, as well as changes in body tone, abdominal tone and pupil size. A composite withdrawal score was plotted against time; this score increased significantly (P less than .01) 1 day after withdrawal and remained significantly elevated for 17 days. This technique provides a quantitative method to study the effect of withdrawal from benzodiazepines in mice.
Whether resveratrol, a component of red grapes, berries, and peanuts, could suppress the proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM) cells by interfering with NF-kappaB and STAT3 pathways, was investigated. Resveratrol inhibited the proliferation of human multiple myeloma cell lines regardless of whether they were sensitive or resistant to the conventional chemotherapy agents. This stilbene also potentiated the apoptotic effects of bortezomib and thalidomide. Resveratrol induced apoptosis as indicated by accumulation of sub-G(1) population, increase in Bax release, and activation of caspase-3. This correlated with down-regulation of various proliferative and antiapoptotic gene products, including cyclin D1, cIAP-2, XIAP, survivin, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1/A1, and TRAF2. In addition, resveratrol down-regulated the constitutive activation of AKT. These effects of resveratrol are mediated through suppression of constitutively active NF-kappaB through inhibition of IkappaBalpha kinase and the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and of p65. Resveratrol inhibited both the constitutive and the interleukin 6-induced activation of STAT3. When we examined CD138(+) plasma cells from patients with MM, resveratrol inhibited constitutive activation of both NF-kappaB and STAT3, leading to down-regulation of cell proliferation and potentiation of apoptosis induced by bortezomib and thalidomide. These mechanistic findings suggest that resveratrol may have a potential in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
Chest wall rigidity has been reported after the administration of high-dose intravenous fentanyl. This case report supports the observation that low-dose intravenous fentanyl may also cause chest wall rigidity. The treatment of chest wall rigidity with naloxone or neuromuscular blocking agents is controversial. A discussion of the management of fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity is presented.
