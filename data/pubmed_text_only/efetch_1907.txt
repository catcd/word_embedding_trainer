Hypersexuality is a known, though not frequently publicized, behavioral disturbance in patients with Parkinson disease. Hypersexuality has been associated with dopaminergic drug therapy. We describe a patient with Parkinson disease who presented with compulsive hypersexual behavior. Lowering of dopaminergic drug doses was of minimal behavioral benefit but was not well tolerated because of worsening of motor function. A trial with donepezil led to significant amelioration of the compulsive behavior without adverse motor effects.
Levels of serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen were measured in 170 patients with psoriasis (49% with coexistent psoriatic arthritis) who had liver biopsies performed during or before treatment with methotrexate or, in some cases, with retinoids. Psoriasis patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis in their liver biopsy specimens had a significantly higher mean serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen than did patients without fibrosis and without arthritis. Only 4% of patients without cirrhosis or fibrosis and no arthritis had an elevated serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. In contrast, 38% of patients with psoriatic arthritis had an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of detectable liver fibrosis. It is concluded that the number of liver biopsies performed on methotrexate-treated psoriasis patients with or without arthritis may be reduced to a minimum as long as serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen is normal. Increased serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of arthritis is a strong indicator of liver fibrogenesis and suggests the need for liver biopsy to monitor possible methotrexate-induced toxicity. In patients with psoriatic arthritis an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen may be related to the joint disease. Patients with psoriatic arthritis and increased levels of aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen should therefore follow the established guidelines for the use of methotrexate in psoriasis.
The primary site of mercury-induced injury is the kidney due to uptake of the reactive Hg(2+)-conjugated organic anions in the proximal tubule. Here, we investigated the in vivo role of Oat1 (organic anion transporter 1; originally NKT (Lopez-Nieto, C. E., You, G., Bush, K. T., Barros, E. J., Beier, D. R., and Nigam, S. K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6471-6478)) in handling of known nephrotoxic doses of HgCl(2). Oat1 (Slc22a6) is a multispecific organic anion drug transporter that is expressed on the basolateral aspects of renal proximal tubule cells and that mediates the initial steps of elimination of a broad range of endogenous metabolites and commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals. Mercury-induced nephrotoxicity was observed in a wild-type model. We then used the Oat1 knock-out to determine in vivo whether the renal injury effects of mercury are mediated by Oat1. Most of the renal injury (both histologically and biochemically as measured by blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) was abolished following HgCl(2) treatment of Oat1 knock-outs. Thus, acute kidney injury by HgCl(2) was found to be mediated mainly by Oat1. Our findings raise the possibility that pharmacological modulation of the expression and/or function of Oat1 might be an effective therapeutic strategy for reducing renal injury by mercury. This is one of the most striking phenotypes so far identified in the Oat1 knock-out. (Eraly, S. A., Vallon, V., Vaughn, D. A., Gangoiti, J. A., Richter, K., Nagle, M., Monte, J. C., Rieg, T., Truong, D. M., Long, J. M., Barshop, B. A., Kaler, G., and Nigam, S. K. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 5072-5083).
The incidence of lidocaine allergy is rare. A confirmed case of antigen/antibody reaction is presented here. It is further distinguished by the unusual presence of blurred vision in the patient.
Bilateral necrosis of the globus pallidus was observed in a 43-year-old man who had received treatment for malignant hypertension with sodium nitroprusside. Cyanide released from sodium nitroprusside may have caused the pallidal lesions in the presence of deranged liver function and episodes of hypoxia.
Glioblastoma is the most prevalent and highly malignant brain tumor that continues to defy current treatment strategies. This investigation used all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and taxol (TXL) as a combination therapy for controlling the growth of human glioblastoma T98G xenografted in athymic nude mice. Histopathological examination revealed that ATRA induced differentiation and combination of ATRA and TXL caused more apoptosis than either treatment alone. Combination therapy decreased expression of telomerase, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappacapital VE, Cyrillic), and inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) indicating suppression of survival factors while upregulated Smac/Diablo. Combination therapy also changed expression of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins leading to increased Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and activation of caspase-9. Increased activities of calpain and caspase-3 degraded 270 kD alpha-spectrin at the specific sites to generate 145 kD spectrin breakdown product (SBDP) and 120 kD SBDP, respectively. Further, increased activity of caspase-3 cleaved inhibitor-of-caspase-activated DNase (ICAD). In situ double immunofluorescent labelings showed overexpression of calpain, caspase-12, caspase-3, and AIF during apoptosis, suggesting involvement of both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways for apoptosis. Our investigation revealed that treatment of glioblastoma T98G xenografts with the combination of ATRA and TXL induced differentiation and multiple molecular mechanisms for apoptosis.
Indomethacin has been suggested as a therapeutic tool to manage elevated intracranial pressure in patients with severe head injury and patients undergoing craniotomy for brain tumors. Indomethacin is a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Compared to other cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin has unique effects on cerebral blood flow. Administration of indomethacin causes cerebral vasoconstriction and decreases cerebral blood flow, which elicits a decrease in intracranial pressure. The mechanism of indomethacin-induced cerebral vasoconstriction is not completely understood and controversies exist whether indomethacin causes cerebral ischemia. The primary aims of this article were to review the existing knowledge of indomethacin's influence upon cerebral hemodynamics and elevated ICP in patients with brain pathology. Furthermore, indomethacin's mechanism of action and whether it causes cerebral ischemia are discussed.
An 80 year old diabetic male with evidence of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy was admitted with chest pain. He was found to have atrial flutter at a ventricular rate of 70/min which slowed down to 30-40/min when nifedipine (60 mg) in 3 divided doses, during which he was paced at a rate of 70/min. This is inconsistent with the well-established finding that nifedipine induces tachycardia in normally innervated hearts. However, in hearts deprived of compensatory sympathetic drive, it may lead to bradycardia.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on mitomycin C (MMC)-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in corneal fibroblasts. Primary human corneal fibroblasts were treated with MMC, dexamethasone, or in combination. Morphological changes and cell growth were documented using phase-contrast microscopy and PicoGreen assay, respectively. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V/propidium iodide staining, whereas viability was tested by the live/dead assay and analyzed by flow cytometry. The relative expression of interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was investigated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 expression were documented by Western blot analysis. We found that MMC induced corneal fibroblast elongation, apoptosis, and retarded cell growth, whereas DEX did not significantly alter cell morphology or viability. The combination of DEX and MMC did not induce additional apoptosis and cell death. DEX dose dependently down-regulated basal and MMC-induced interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA expression and protein secretion. DEX attenuated MMC-induced p38 and Jun N-terminal kinases activation and up-regulated expression. These suggested that DEX may inhibit MMC-induced interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by up-regulating MKP-1 expression, which subsequently deactivated p38 and Jun N-terminal kinases activation. Combined MMC and DEX treatment may facilitate corneal wound healing.
Cardiac and cerebrovascular complications associated with cocaine abuse have increasingly been reported, but concurrent development of cocaine-induced cardiac disease and stroke has rarely been reported.
A 37-year-old man with a remote history of intravenous heroin and amphetamine use, cardiomyopathy, and recent cocaine use developed chest pain and ventricular tachycardia 30 minutes after intranasal cocaine hydrochloride use and jogging on a cold winter morning. Ventricular tachycardia was converted to atrial fibrillation. He was proven to have a small myocardial infarction. Within 6 hours of cocaine use he suffered a left hemisphere stroke. Cardiac electrophysiologic evaluation revealed inducible ventricular tachycardia.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrent myocardial infarction, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and cerebral infarction temporally related to cocaine use. It is probable that one mechanism by which cocaine use causes stroke is to trigger expression of a known cardiac source of embolism.
Drug-induced aseptic meningitis attributable to trimethoprim alone has only rarely been documented in the literature. A previously healthy adolescent male presented to our hospital with recurrent headaches, photophobia, and meningismus after serially starting and stopping trimethoprim. Cerebrospinal fluid studies revealed elevated white blood cell counts with a polymorphonuclear predominance. This case is the second documented report of trimethoprim-induced aseptic meningitis in a pediatric patient.
This report describes two cases of cardiotoxicity associated with the use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the treatment of neoplastic disease, and reviews the literature to date. The manifestations of cardiac toxicity were significant ventricular dysfunction during continuous infusion of 5-FU, accompanied by symptoms resembling cardiac ischemia in one case and irreversible cardiogenic shock in another. Detailed cardiac investigations and pathological findings provide convincing evidence that the development of acute myocarditis is the likely mechanism of 5-FU cardiotoxicity, rather than coronary insufficiency as has commonly been postulated. Although cardiotoxicity as a complication of 5-FU therapy remains rare, recognition of this entity is important as it may lead to serious hemodynamic compromise and may recur with drug rechallenge.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been implicated in the development of gastrointestinal malignancies. The aim of the present study was to determine COX-2 expression/activity throughout stages of experimental and human pancreatic neoplasia. COX-2 immunohistochemistry was performed in pancreata of hamsters subjected to the carcinogen N-nitrosobis-(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP) and in human pancreatic tumors. COX-2 activity was determined by prostaglandin E2 assay in tumor versus matched normal pancreatic tissues. The activity of the COX inhibitor sulindac was tested in the PC-1 hamster pancreatic cancer model. COX-2 expression was elevated in all pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and adenocarcinomas. In BOP-treated hamsters, there were significant progressive elevations in COX-2 expression throughout pancreatic tumorigenesis. In human samples, peak COX-2 expression occurred in PanIN2 lesions and remained moderately elevated in PanIN3 and adenocarcinoma tissues. COX-2 activity was significantly elevated in hamster and human pancreatic cancers compared to pair-matched normal pancreas. Furthermore, hamster pancreatic tumor engraftment/formation in the PC-1 hamster pancreatic cancer model was reduced 4.9-fold by oral administration of sulindac. Increased COX-2 expression is an early event in pancreatic carcinogeneses. The BOP-induced hamster carcinogenesis model is a representative model used to study the role of COX-2 in well-differentiated pancreatic tumorigenesis. COX inhibitors may have a role in preventing tumor engraftment/formation.
To describe a patient with an incidental pituitary lesion who experienced verapamil-induced hyperprolactinemia.
A patient experiencing impotence was found to have increased prolactin and low testosterone concentrations. Verapamil as a cause for his increased prolactin concentration was not considered initially. The patient underwent extensive testing to rule out a pituitary tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 6-mm lesion consistent with a pituitary microadenoma that had remained unchanged for 6 months. Verapamil therapy was discontinued and within 1 month the patient's prolactin concentration decreased from 46.8 to 14.4 micrograms/L, and has remained within normal limits.
We reviewed reports of verapamil-induced hyperprolactinemia. This case was unique as this patient had an incidental pituitary lesion that was not responsible for increasing the prolactin concentration in our patient, but rather complicated the identification of a drug-induced disorder.
The failure to identify the hyperprolactinemic effect of verapamil may have resulted in performing unnecessary radiologic procedures in this patient. This case highlights the importance of obtaining a medication history in patients with hyperprolactinemia.
The effects of alpha-adrenoceptors agents on seizures induced by intraperitoneal administration of lidocaine (75 mg/kg) were studied in mice. Pretreatment with the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, tizanidine, decreased the incidence of seizures induced by lidocaine. Tizanidine increased the latency to the first seizure in those animals which progressed to seizures. The blockade of alpha 2-adrenoceptors with yohimbine or phentolamine counteracted the protection induced by tizanidine. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, did not modify the protection induced by tizanidine. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine also increased the latency to the first seizure induced by lidocaine. The protective effect of clonidine was also reversed by pretreatment with the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in seizures induced by lidocaine.
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors like captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, trandopril and ramipril may rarely induce a life threatening angioedema. We present two cases of severe angioedema induced by enalapril and ramipril along with possible precipitating factors observed in these patients. The importance of prompt recognition and early management of such cases is emphasized.
Immunological abnormalities frequently observed in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are considered to be related to the pathogenesis of this disease. We performed a prospective trial to evaluate whether immune mechanisms play a role in the effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy. Fifteen female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were followed for 1 year and were then treated with UDCA (600 mg/day) for another year. Laboratory tests, including peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets assessed by dual colour fluorescence analysis using monoclonal antibodies against respective T cell markers, were evaluated at the beginning of the study, at the start of therapy and at the end of therapy. In primary biliary cirrhosis, the proportion of cytotoxic T cells, suppressor inducer T cells and alpha beta-receptor bearing T cells were significantly lower than in healthy controls. No significant changes were observed in the proportions during the year before the therapy. These reductions, however, recovered to normal ranges after 1 year of UDCA therapy. These changes were associated with an improvement in the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-globulin and IgM. The close correlation between the improvement in the imbalance of lymphocyte subsets after the therapy and the clinical status suggests that an immunological process may play a role in the effectiveness of therapy in primary biliary cirrhosis.
Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) that selectively identify Muc-1 core protein (MoAbs DF3-P, VU-4H5) determinants were used to identify the Muc-1 glycoform present on 7 multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines, 5 MM patient plasma cells, 12 MM patient B cells, as well as 32 non-MM cell lines and normal hematopoietic cells. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated that all MM cell lines, MM patient plasma cells, and MM patient B cells expressed Muc-1 core protein epitopes. Circulating B cells from 4 normal donors also expressed Muc-1 core protein. In contrast, Muc-1 core protein was absent on 28 of 32 non-MM neoplastic cell lines, 17 of which expressed Muc-1. Splenic and tonsillar B cells, CD34(+) stem cells, resting T cells, and bone marrow plasma cells obtained from normal donors both lacked Muc-1 glycoforms. We next studied the effects of estrogen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptor agonists and antagonists on Muc-1 expression, because consensus sequences for the response elements of these steroids are present on the Muc-1 gene promoter. These studies showed that dexamethasone (Dex) induced Muc-1 expression on MM cell lines, as determined by both flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. Dex also induced upregulation of Muc-1 on prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines. Time and dose-response studies demonstrated that Dex induced maximal cell surface Muc-1 expression by 24 hours at concentrations of 10(-8) mol/L. Dex induced Muc-1 upregulation could be blocked with a 10-fold excess of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, confirming that Dex was acting via the glucocorticoid receptor. No changes in Muc-1 expression were observed on MM cells treated with estrogen and progesterone receptor agonists and antagonists or with RU486. These studies provide the framework for targeting Muc-1 core protein in vaccination and serotherapy trials in MM. In addition, the finding that Muc-1 expression on MM cells can be augmented by Dex at pharmacologically achievable levels suggests their potential utility in enhancing treatments targeting Muc-1 in MM.
In this study, our aim was to investigate the proarrhythmic effects of levofloxacin. Twenty-six patients who were diagnosed as having community-acquired pneumonia were enrolled in the study. Intravenous levofloxacin, 500 mg daily, was given, and 12-lead ECG measurements were obtained before the infusion, at 30 and 60 minutes during infusion, and 10 minutes after its cessation. Resting late potentials were recorded before and after infusion. Twelve female and 14 male patients were participated the study. Mean age was 51.3 +/- 22.3 years. Levofloxacin infusion increased the heart rate (HR) and prolonged the corrected QT (QTc) intervals significantly (baseline HR: 84.6 +/- 18.8 vs. HR at 60 minutes: 88.6 +/- 18, P = 0.02; baseline QTc: 413.5 +/- 36.9 milliseconds vs. QTc at 60 minutes: 426.1 +/- 34.7, P = 0,006). There was no significant difference between the late potential values obtained before and after infusion. None of our patients experienced severe arrhythmia that required stopping the treatment. A single dose of IV levofloxacin prolongs the QTc interval without significant change in late potentials. Monitoring ECG during levofloxacin infusion might be necessary in patients who have a condition that could affect the QTc interval.
Recent case series have associated the synthetic opioid, methadone, with QT prolongation and torsades de pointes (TdP) ventricular arrhythmia.
To review and analyze adverse events (QT prolongation and TdP) reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine the patient characteristics, dosages of methadone, and outcomes of methadone-treated patients.
The study design was a retrieval and retrospective analysis of reports of adverse events associated with methadone voluntarily reported to the FDA MedWatch program from 1969 to October 2002. Reports were accessed via QSCAN (DrugLogic, Reston, VA), a commercially available software interface.
In a total of 5,503 reports of adverse events associated with methadone, 43 (0.78%) noted the occurrence of TdP and 16 (0.29%) QT prolongation. Doses were reported in 42/59 (71%) of cases; mean dose was 410 +/- 349 mg/day (median 345, range 29-1680). The dosages for 10 of the 42 cases (29%) were within the recommended range for methadone maintenance treatment, 60-100 mg/day. Female gender, interacting medications, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and structural heart disease, risk factors previously identified with other drugs known to cause TdP, were found in 44 (75%) cases. Most adverse events required hospitalization or resulted in prolonged hospitalization (28/59, 47%) and 5/59 (8%) were fatal.
Cases of TdP associated with methadone have been reported to the FDA MedWatch system. Analysis of the cases provides evidence that prolonged QT and TdP can occur over a wide range of dosages including those usually recommended for addiction treatment.
The alpha, beta-unsaturated lactones 2-furanone and 2-pyrone are part of the chemical structure of a variety of naturally occurring compounds (e.g., cardenolides, bufadienolides, acetogenins, coumarins, and food-flavoring furanones), some of which have shown anticancer activity and/or DNA damaging effects. Here we report that 2-furanone and 2-pyrone induce cellular DNA damage (assessed by the comet assay and the gamma-H2AX focus assay) and the formation of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes in cells (visualized and quantified in situ by the TARDIS assay). Cells mutated in BRCA2 (deficient in homologous recombination repair) were significantly hypersensitive to the cytotoxic activity of 2-pyrone, therefore suggesting that BRCA2 plays an important role in the repair of DNA damage induced by this lactone. Both lactones were cytotoxic in A549 lung cancer cells at lower concentrations than in MRC5 non-malignant lung fibroblasts. The possible involvement of 2-furanone and 2-pyrone in the anticancer and DNA-damaging activities of compounds containing these lactones is discussed.
The present study was undertaken in order to investigate the influence of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on the composition of sulfate-conjugated bile acids in the serum and urine of patients with chronic active hepatitis and compensated liver cirrhosis. After a 12 week UDCA treatment (600 mg/day), total serum bile acid concentration increased two-fold in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and increased slightly in patients with chronic active hepatitis. The percentage of sulfated bile acids significantly increased in patients with both compensated liver cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis. UDCA made up 63% of the total serum bile acids in compensated liver cirrhosis and 61% in chronic active hepatitis after UDCA treatment. Of the serum bile acids after UDCA treatment, 35.2 and 53.9% of UDCA was sulfate conjugated in compensated liver cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis, respectively. Urinary excretion of total bile acid and UDCA after UDCA treatment in compensated liver cirrhosis were higher than in chronic active hepatitis. UDCA made up 68% of the total urinary bile acids in compensated liver cirrhosis and 64% in chronic active hepatitis after UDCA treatment. Of the urinary bile acids after UDCA treatment, 51.8 and 54.8% of UDCA was sulfate conjugated in compensated liver cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis, respectively. UDCA treatment for compensated liver cirrhosis was less effective than for chronic active hepatitis. We found that sulfate conjugation is one of the major metabolic pathways for UDCA after UDCA treatment in chronic liver diseases.
Forty-six lithium (Li) patients who had been on Li for about 1-11 years were studied while on Li and after about 3 months (7 weeks-26 months) off Li. Kidney function was compared between patients on Li and the same patients off Li, and, in 32 matched pairs, between patients on and off Li and psychiatric controls. Urine osmolality (U-osmol) was significantly lower, urine volume higher in patients on Li than in controls. Measures of both glomerular and tubular function improved when Li-patients discontinued medication. U-osmol remained somewhat lower than in controls and was negatively correlated with time-on-Li. Although serum creatinine was somewhat higher in Li-patients off Li than in controls, clearance values were not different between the two groups. Long-term lithium treatment causes a permanent reduction of tubular function. Time-on-Li is a risk factor. In this population the reduction was clinically insignificant. In addition, Li treatment causes a reversible reduction of both tubular and glomerular function. The results can probably be generalized to other outpatient Li populations with the same time-on-Li and with U-osmol below 800 mOsm/kg during ongoing treatment.
S-methyl-isothiourea (SMT) is a potent inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS) with relative selectivity towards the inducible isoform (iNOS). We compared SMT and norepinephrine for the treatment of experimental endotoxic shock. Anesthetized rats challenged intravenously with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 10 mg/kg, were treated after 1 h with a 4-h infusion of norepinephrine (titrated to maintain blood pressure within baseline values), SMT at low dose (0.1 mg x kg-1 x h-1), or at high dose (1 mg x kg-1 x h-1), or an equivalent volume of saline (2 ml x kg-1 x h-1). In saline-treated animals, LPS increased plasma nitrate and produced hypotension, low cardiac output (CO), lactic acidosis, and signs of liver and kidney dysfunction. Norepinephrine maintained blood pressure (BP) and reduced the fall in CO, without affecting lactic acidosis, organ dysfunction, and nitrate accumulation. The latter was dose-dependently blunted by SMT. Treatment with this agent prevented hypotension, through systemic vasoconstriction with the high dose and a maintained CO with the low dose. Low, but not high, dose SMT blunted lactic acidosis. Both doses reduced the signs of renal, but not liver, dysfunction. In additional studies, we obtained evidence that, in contrast with the high dose, SMT at low dose did not interfere with the function of constitutive NOS. These findings suggest a potential advantage of selective iNOS inhibition over standard adrenergic support in the therapy of septic shock.
The proarrhythmic effects of 3-hydroxy-hydroquinidine (3-OH-HQ) and quinidine were compared in a canine model of QT-dependent ventricular arrhythmias. Eight hypokalemic ([K+] < or = 3.2 mmol/l) dogs with AV block (around 45 bpm) were given either drug in a randomized order at 2-day intervals. Each drug was given as two 1 hour doses, with a bolus (low dose: 5 mg/kg or high dose: 10 mg/kg) plus infusion (25 or 50 micrograms/kg/min) protocol. Propranolol infusion was combined with a third hour of the high dose infusion. Electrophysiologic measurements were performed at baseline and 30 minutes after the beginning of each dose and propranolol infusion, and proarrhythmic events were recorded 30 minutes before and during the experiment. Neither drugs altered the ventricular cycle length. Quinidine and 3-OH-HQ prolonged the QT interval similarly and significantly when paced at 60 bpm after the low dose (+39 +/- 18 and +28 +/- 22 msec, respectively) and after the high dose (+51 +/- 29 and +50 +/- 22 msec). Quinidine was more arrhythmogenic than 3-OH-HQ: 7/8 dogs (p < or = 0.05) developed ventricular arrhythmias (isolated, repetitive ventricular beats, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias) during quinidine infusion (low dose: 4 dogs) compared to 3/8 dogs (NS) during 3-OH-HQ infusion (low dose: 1 dog). Addition of propranolol-induced bradycardia (around 30 bpm) caused torsades de pointes (wave burst arrhythmias) or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias after both drugs (in 3 dogs after quinidine and in 2 dogs after 3-OH-HQ). Thus 3-OH-HQ was slightly less arrhythmogenic than quinidine in this model of torsades de pointes, but the addition of an extra favouring factor (bradycardia) reduced that difference.
The neuroprotective effects of a novel synthetic compound, M50463, have been determined by using embryonic rat neocortical neurons in various culture conditions. M50463 was initially characterized as a potent specific ligand for a voltage-dependent sodium channel by radioligand binding studies. In fact, M50463 inhibited neuronal cell death induced by veratrine and inhibited an increase of the intracellular calcium level in neurons evoked by veratrine. In addition to such expected effects, M50463 had the ability to prevent glutamate neurotoxicity, to promote the neuronal survival in serum-deprived medium and to prevent nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity. These results suggested that M50463 is not a simple sodium channel blocker, but a neuroprotective agent which has some crucial mechanism of action on neuronal death occurring in various situations, and it is a novel, innovative candidate for neuroprotective therapy for various neurodegenerative disorders.
Silver nanomaterials are increasingly being used as antimicrobial agents in medical devices. This study assessed the in vitro hemolytic potential of unbound silver particles in human blood to determine which physical and chemical particle properties contribute to mechanisms of red blood cell (RBC) damage. Four silver particle powders (two nano-sized and two micron-sized) were dispersed in water and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and zeta potential measurement. Particle size and agglomeration were dependent on the suspension media. Under similar conditions to the hemolysis assay, with the particles added to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and plasma, the size of the nanoparticles increased compared with particles suspended in water alone due to interaction with chloride ions and plasma proteins. To determine hemolysis response, aqueous particle suspensions were mixed with heparinized human blood diluted in PBS for 3.5 h at 37°C. Both nanoparticle preparations were significantly more hemolytic than micron-sized particles at equivalent mass concentrations > 220 μg/ml and at estimated surface area concentrations > 10 cm(2)/ml. The presence or absence of surface citrate on nanoparticles showed no significant difference in hemolysis. However, the aqueous nanoparticle preparations released significantly more silver ions than micron-sized particles, which correlated with increased hemolysis. Although significant size changes occurred to the silver particles due to interaction with media components, the higher level of in vitro hemolysis observed with nanoparticles compared with micron-sized particles may be related to their greater surface area, increased silver ion release, and direct interaction with RBCs.
Acetaldehyde has been shown to be cytotoxic and carcinogenic to the upper respiratory tract epithelium of rodents following long-term exposure. Most animal studies have concentrated on carcinogenicity and DNA-protein cross-link formation, while less is known about potential dose- and time-dependent induction of aldehyde-induced rhinitis in humans. In this in vitro study, 22 primary cell cultures established from inferior turbinate tissue of healthy individuals were exposed to acetaldehyde concentrations of 50 (German MAK value) or 500 ppm for 4 or 24 h. mRNA expression and protein levels of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators were quantified at the end of the 4- and 24-h exposures. Controls were exposed to synthetic air. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) analysis was performed for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, GMCSF, Cox-1, and Cox-2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed from culture supernatants for IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, and GMCSF. Significant inductions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and Cox-1 and Cox-2 mRNA were observed following exposure to > or =50 ppm acetaldehyde for 4 h. IL-6 and MCP-1 were also induced following a 4-h exposure to 500 ppm acetaldehyde. For all these parameters, effects were significantly stronger at the higher concentration. After 24-h of exposure only Cox-2 remained significantly elevated at 500 ppm but not at 50 ppm, while all other mediators had been downregulated. The obtained data suggest that with exposure to 500 ppm and remarkably also at the level of the occupational exposure limit of 50 ppm, an immediate transient upregulation of inflammatory mediator mRNA is induced, possibly leading to subclinical inflammatory effects.
This study aimed to assess the resource utilisation, health benefits and cost-effectiveness of intra-detrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT/A) in patients with overactive bladder (OAB).
101 patients with urodynamically-proven detrusor overactivity of either neurogenic (NDO; n = 63) or idiopathic (IDO; n = 38) origin received intra-detrusor injections of 200-300 units of BoNT/A in 20-30 ml saline as part of a research protocol. Twenty-nine patients received repeat injections after 7-26 months. Symptom severity and urodynamic parameters were assessed at 0, 4 and 16 weeks. The cost of therapy was quantified based on the NHS resources used by typical patients and was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of BoNT/A compared with standard care from the perspective of the UK NHS.
In an intent-to-treat analysis, 82% of patients showed a 25% or greater improvement in at least two out of five parameters (urinary frequency, urgency, urgency incontinence episodes, maximum cystometric capacity and maximum detrusor pressure) four weeks after treatment, reducing to 65% after 16 weeks. A 50% or greater improvement in the frequency of micturition, urgency or urgency incontinence was seen in 73% of patients at four weeks and 54% at 16 weeks. There were no significant differences between IDO and NDO patients in the proportion meeting these endpoints. Therapy cost pounds 826 per patient, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of pounds 617 per patient-year with > or = 25% clinical improvement.
This study demonstrates that intra-detrusor BoNT/A is an effective treatment for OAB that is highly likely to be cost-effective in both idiopathic and neurogenic disease.
The haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 genotype is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes (DM). We recently proposed this increased risk arises from the tethering of redox active hemoglobin (Hb) to high density lipoprotein (HDL), thereby resulting in oxidative modification of HDL. Clinical trials have demonstrated that vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) decreases while vitamin C increases CVD in Hp 2-2 DM individuals. We sought to test the hypothesis that the interaction of alpha-tocopherol or vitamin C on CVD in Hp 2-2 DM was due to their divergent effects on HDL oxidation and function. Vitamin C significantly increased while alpha-tocopherol completely blocked oxidation mediated by glycosylated Hb-Hp 2-2. Vitamin C had no benefit while alpha-tocopherol completely restored HDL function in Hp 2-2 DM mice. Co-administration of vitamin C mitigated the protective effects of alpha-tocopherol on HDL. There exists a pharmacogenomic interaction between vitamin C and alpha-tocopherol and the Hp 2-2 genotype on HDL function and structure. Choosing the correct antioxidant in the correct subset of patients may be critical in order to demonstrate benefit from antioxidant therapy.
