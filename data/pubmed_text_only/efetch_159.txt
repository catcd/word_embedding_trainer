In newborn infants suffering from perinatal asphyxia seizures, lidocaine (LD) has proved to be an effective anticonvulsant. At high concentrations, however, LD can itself cause convulsions. The convulsive concentration of LD (LD(conv)) varies among species. The aim of this study was to describe LD pharmacokinetics and to define the LD(conv) in awake newborn pigs. Eighteen Land race newborn pigs aged 12-60 h, weight 1.0-2.5 kg, were enrolled. LD, 2 mg/kg intravenous (IV) bolus, (n = 11) was given to estimate pharmacokinetic variables. Continuous LD infusion 2 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) IV (n = 5) and repeated bolus doses of 15 mg/kg (n = 4) were given until electroencephalogram-confirmed seizures appeared. After the bolus injection, the elimination half-life for LD was 0.87-5.44 h. Increasing plasma concentration (LD(pl)) during infusion resulted in sedation after 5-10 min and in shivering, nystagmus, neck extension, tonic-clonic seizures at LD(conv) of 40.6 +/- 12.7 mg/L (mean +/- SD). The unbound LD(pl) at seizures was 4.4 +/- 2.4 mg/L. Younger animals convulsed at higher LD(conv) (r2 = 0.85). LD pharmacokinetics in newborn pigs were found to be dose-dependent at high plasma concentrations. At lower plasma concentrations, LD pharmacokinetics appeared to be linear. The central nervous system is the primary target for the toxic effect of LD in awake newborn pigs. LD neurotoxicity is age-dependent, and younger pigs convulse at a higher LD(conv).
The most common serious adverse effects (AEs) associated with NSAID therapy are bleeding and perforated gastroduodenal ulcers. These AEs are dose related, and reduced oral clearance of NSAIDs associated with polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) would, theoretically, increase the risk for AEs.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether polymorphisms of the CYP2C9 genotype are associated with the development of serious complications of NSAID-related ulcers.
We examined the records of patients with complications of serious NSAID-related ulcers who were hospitalized from November 2001 to December 2003. Diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopy or abdominal surgery, and a group of consecutive subjects was identified for genetic analysis. CYP2C9 allele frequencies were determined and compared with those in a matched cohort of subjects receiving stable weekly maintenance doses of oral coumarin anticoagulants. Allele frequencies also were compared with those in matched cohorts from earlier studies.
All 26 subjects with serious NSAID-related ulcers were white, 15 (58%) were female, and the median age was 74.5 years (range, 32-96 years). All 87 subjects in the reference group were white, 24 (28%) were female, and the median age was 69 years (range, 48-81 years). CYP2C9 genotype frequencies did not differ significantly between subjects with serious complications of NSAID-related ulcers and subjects using oral coumarin anticoagulants. The genotype frequencies in both groups were similar to those reported in previous studies in white subjects.
The CYP2C9 genotype was not a significant or clinically relevant risk factor in the development of serious NSAID-related ulcers in this group of subjects.
To assess the applicability of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the management of vulvodynia whereby a novel, patch-type system, loaded with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), was used to administer PDT to vulvar regions displaying the characteristics of vulvodynia.
Eleven patients underwent PDT using a bioadhesive patch to deliver ALA over 4 hours. A nonlaser light source delivered 100 J cm(-2) to the target area using red light of 630 nm. Fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX was observed under ultraviolet light illumination, with no significant difference found between that produced after the first and second applications of the patch.
There was a significant reduction (p= 0.0077) in overall symptoms after completion of treatment. No significant alleviation (p = 0.1088) in pain during intercourse was observed following treatment. Eight patients experienced a symptomatic response, while 3 exhibited no improvements in symptoms. No adverse reactions or worsening of reported symptoms was reported.
The results suggest that PDT is of value in the management of vulvodynia, most probably as a viable option to conventional approaches. Further studies involving larger numbers of patients are required to confirm the efficacy of PDT in the management of vulvodynia.
Results of a study carried out in 21 patients with acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin), hypersensitivity, 17 females and 4 males, aged 16 to 69 years (mean 45.7) are presented. Some patients suffered from several types of allergic symptoms - 11 from Asthma, 3 Rhinitis, 3 Quinke edema, 5 Urticaria and 2 Anaphylactic Shock. Concomitant drug allergies, route of administration and composition of the ingested drug, familiar complaints of drug allergy, nasopharyngeal examination and lung function by spirometry and Acetylcholine tests were evaluated. Blood, sputum and nasal mucous eosinophil count, as well as secretory IgA and its secretory piece identification in saliva and nasal mucous, serotonin and histaminopexic power of serum and immunoelectrophoresis of serum proteins were performed in all patients. Human basophil degranulation test to Aspirin were evaluated in 12 patients. Skin prick tests with one standard range of 21 common allergens were done in all patients and intradermal skin tests with 1 lysine acetyl-salicylate (1/100 and 1/1000) were performed in all patients as well as in a selected control group of 12 healthy subjects.
Acute renal failure is commonly seen in adults after treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. This complication has rarely been reported in children.
Four consecutive patients admitted with acute nonoliguric renal failure associated with ingestion of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.
The emergency department and ward units at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Four patients, ages 3.5 to 19 years.
Appropriate evaluations including measurement of serum creatinine concentrations in the emergency department and careful histories of drug ingestion.
Rapid return to normal serum creatinine concentrations.
Four patients were admitted to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between May 1996 and June 1997 with a diagnosis of acute, nonoliguric renal failure following ingestion of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. None of the patients had features of hemolytic uremic syndrome, systemic lupus, dehydration, obstructive uropathy or sickle cell disease. Each patient had ingested nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents before the onset of acute renal failure. None had oliguria or anuria, dehydration, abnormal serum electrolyte concentrations, or evidence of glomerulonephritis. One patient also had a urinary tract infection that was treated with antibiotics. Another patient was treated with methylprednisolone and prednisone. None was biopsied. Three recovered completely.
With the increasing use of over-the-counter nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, this association may become more prevalent.
Third-generation cephalosporins in general have few adverse effects and cefotaxime (Claforan) particularly is considered to be a good choice because of the favourable side effect profile. In patients with severe renal failure there have been reports of confusion and psychosis. The manufacturer therefore recommends that half the ordinary dose should be given to patients with severe renal failure. Half the ordinary dose can still be too much. We describe a patient in hemodialysis who reacted with a reversible encephalopathy with psychosis in spite of reduced doses of cefotaxime. The plasma concentration of cefotaxime was high and the reaction was diagnosed as a dose dependent side effect.
Although there are a multitude of in vitro and in vivo studies on the genotoxic activity of EMS, no lifetime carcinogenicity studies, repeat dose mutation data or exposure analysis are available to serve as a solid basis for risk assessment for human exposure cases. The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether a threshold for mutagenic and clastogenic activity in vivo could be established, using the bone marrow micronucleus (MNT) and MutaMouse test systems, in the hope to provide reassurance to the patients that their accidental exposure to EMS at doses up to 0.055 mg/kg did not carry a toxicological risk. Dose levels ranging from 1.25 to 260 mg/kg/day were applied orally for up to 28 days. As a reference we included ENU at doses of 1.1-22 mg/kg/day. Our studies showed that daily doses of up to 25mg/kg/day (bone marrow, GI tract) and 50 mg/kg/day (liver) did not induce mutations in the lacZ gene in the three organs tested. Doses up to 80mg/kg/day (7-day dosing regime) did not induce micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. The genotoxic activity of EMS became apparent only at higher dose levels. Dose fractionation of EMS (28 times 12.5mg/kg versus a single high dose 350 mg/kg) provided further evidence for the thresholded dose response of EMS and showed that no cumulation of gene mutations below a threshold was occurring. In contrast, for ENU no threshold was apparent and dose fractionation indicated full additivity of individual dose effects.
Very few cases of peripheral neuropathy as a complication of disulfiram therapy have been described. The clinical and electrodiagnostic features of two patients who developed a severe peripheral neuropathy during disulfiram administration are reported. Evidence is presented which suggests that disulfiram causes a dying-back axonal neuropathy.
The effect of iron fortification is generally assumed to be less than iron supplementation; however, the magnitude of difference in effects is not known. The present study aims to compare the efficacy of these two strategies on anaemia and iron status. After screening on low Hb, 425 anaemic children in six primary schools in Tam Nong district of Phu Tho province were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing two groups receiving iron fortified instant noodles or iron supplementation for 6 months and a control group, with children in all groups having been dewormed. Blood samples were collected before and after intervention for haemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF), serum transferrin receptor (TfR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and haemoglobinopathies analysis. Regression analysis was used to assess the effect of iron fortification and iron supplementation on haemoglobin concentration, SF, TfR, body iron, and anaemic status as outcome variables. The improvement of haemoglobin, SF, and body iron level in the group receiving iron fortification was 42% (2.6 g/L versus 6.2 g/L), 20% (23.5 microg/L versus 117.3 microg/L), and 31.3% (1.4 mg/kg versus 4.4 mg/kg) of that in the iron supplementation group. The prevalence of anaemia dropped to 15.1% in the control group, with an additional reduction of anaemia of 8.5% in the iron supplementation group. The additional reduction due to iron fortification was 5.4%, which amounts to well over 50% of the impact of supplementation. In conclusion, the efficacy of iron fortification based on reduction of prevalence of anaemia, and on the change in haemoglobin level, is about half of the maximum impact of supplementation in case of optimal compliance. Thus, in a population of anaemic children with mild iron deficiency, iron fortification should be the preferred strategy to combat anaemia.
Thirty-three patients with acute leukemia (15 with lymphoblastic leukemia and 18 with myeloblastic leukemia) were entered into a program of high-dose radiochemotherapy followed by allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation. These patients were in various clinical stages of disease. Of 10 in complete hematologic remission at the time of transplantation, seven were alive without maintenance therapy at the time of evaluation, eight to 35 months after grafting; one was in relapse. Of 11 who received transplants during partial remission, six were in remission without further treatment eight to 33 months after transplantation. In 12 the disease was refractory to chemotherapy when preparation for transplantation was started, and only one of them was alive and free of disease after 10 months. Recurrent leukemia, graft-versus-host disease, viral pneumonia, and early therapy-related toxicity were the major causes of failure. High-dose chemotherapy and total-body irradiation followed by allogeneic marrow transplantation performed during complete or partial remission can produce long-term remission of acute leukemia.
Chronic hepatitis B patients with active viral replication were treated with acyclovir, either orally 800 mg 4 times daily, or intravenously 15 mg/kg twice daily; duration of treatment was 4 weeks. A second course of intravenous acyclovir (15 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks) was given to 5 patients in combination with intramuscular lymphoblastoid alpha-interferon treatment (2.5 MU/m2, once daily). Oral acyclovir had no detectable effect on DNA-polymerase or HBeAg. Intravenous acyclovir alone depressed HBV replication and HBeAg, followed by prolonged negativity of DNA-polymerase in 4 out of 11 patients. Combination therapy of acyclovir with interferon had a significantly greater fall in DNA-polymerase and HBeAg than acyclovir alone. Apart from thrombophlebitis, therapy with acyclovir was tolerated well provided fluid intake was more than 2 litres daily. The combination therapy of acyclovir with interferon appears the most promising for conversion of a state of active viral replication into virus latency.
Environmental stimuli that are reliably associated with the effects of many abused drugs, especially stimulants such as cocaine, can produce craving and relapse in abstinent human substance abusers. In animals, such cues can induce and maintain drug-seeking behaviour and also reinstate drug-seeking after extinction. Reducing the motivational effects of drug-related cues might therefore be useful in the treatment of addiction. Converging pharmacological, human post-mortem and genetic studies implicate the dopamine D3 receptor in drug addiction. Here we have designed BP 897, the first D3-receptor-selective agonist, as assessed in vitro with recombinant receptors and in vivo with mice bearing disrupted D3-receptor genes. BP 897 is a partial agonist in vitro and acts in vivo as either an agonist or an antagonist. We show that BP 897 inhibits cocaine-seeking behaviour that depends upon the presentation of drug-associated cues, without having any intrinsic, primary rewarding effects. Our data indicate that compounds like BP 897 could be used for reducing the drug craving and vulnerability to relapse that are elicited by drug-associated environmental stimuli.
To ascertain differences between solely hormone- and chemical carcinogen-induced murine mammary gland tumors (MGTs), a direct comparison of their ploidy status was assessed. Nuclear image cytometry (NIC) was used to evaluate ploidy in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and MGTs induced solely by 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) in female A-strain Copenhagen Irish hooded gene rats (ACI) and E(2) plus testosterone propionate in male Noble rats. These results were compared to ploidy data from primary MGTs induced by two synthetic carcinogens, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]antracene and nitrosomethylurea in female Brown Lewis Norway rats and an environmental carcinogen, 6-nitrochrysene, in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Both DCIS and primary MGTs induced solely by hormones were highly aneuploid (> 84%), whereas MGTs induced by either synthetic or environmental carcinogens were primarily diploid (> 85%). Examination of 76 metaphase plates obtained from eight individual E(2)-induced ACI female rat MGTs revealed the following consistent chromosome alterations: gains in chromosomes 7, 11, 12, 13, 19, and 20 and loss of chromosome 12. On Southern blot analysis, six of nine ACI female rat primary E(2)-induced MGTs (66%) exhibited amplified copy numbers (range: 3.4-6.9 copies) of the c-myc gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of these MGTs revealed specific fluorescent hybridization signals for c-myc (7q33) on all three homologs of a trisomy in chromosome 7. NIC analysis of 140 successive nonfamilial sporadic invasive human ductal breast cancers (BCs) showed an aneuploid frequency of 61%, while 31 DCISs revealed a 71% aneuploid frequency. These results clearly demonstrate that the female ACI rat E(2)-induced MGTs more closely resemble invasive human DCIS and ductal BC in two pertinent aspects: they are highly aneuploid compared with chemical carcinogen-induced MGTs and exhibit a high frequency of c-myc amplification.
An intracardiac thrombus is extremely rare in children with the nephrotic syndrome (NS).
To present a case report of a child with steroid resistant NS and intracardiac thrombus.
A 3.5-year-old boy with the first attack of steroid resistant NS was admitted to the hospital. A histological evaluation of the renal biopsy specimen revealed the minimal changes disease (MCD). There were no mutations in the podocin gene. The treatment with furosemide, albumin, prednisone, metylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, enalapril and losartan was ineffective, as the intermittent oedema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia were still present. 8 weeks after the disease onset, the sinus tachycardia occurred and the echocardiography revealed a thrombus in the right ventricle, which had gradually proceeded to the pulmonary artery bifurcation. The thrombolysis with 40 mg of alteplase was initiated. Two hours after the alteplase application, the thrombus was not detectable. The mutational analysis of factors V, II and MFTHR genes were negative. The repeated echocardiography performed after 1 week, 2 and 6 months, respectively, revealed a normal cardiac function and morphology. The patient received prophylactic doses of fraxiparin for 3.5 months followed by warfarin. A remission of the nephrotic syndrome was achieved with high doses of cyclosporine A together with atorvastatin at 7 month after the disease onset.
The thromboembolism as a result of the hypercoagulation status is a serious complication of the nephrotic syndrome. The intracardiac localisation of thrombus is extremely rare (Fig. 2, Ref. 10). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.
Twelve patients with a history of aspirin-induced urticaria and/or angioedema were studied before and after the provocation of symptoms with aspirin. The resting plasma histamine levels in these patients (0.95 +/- 0.25 ng/mL) were significantly higher than in 30 control subjects (0.21 +/- 0.02 ng/mL) (P less than .0005) and nine patients with non-aspirin-sensitive urticaria (0.27 +/- 0.06 ng/mL) (P less than .01). The plasma histamine levels fell significantly at the time of adverse reactions to aspirin (P less than .01). The high resting histamine levels, like the high venous prostaglandin F2 alpha levels that we have previously reported in the same group of patients and the high plasma histamine levels we have found in aspirin-sensitive asthmatics suggest an abnormality of mediator release in aspirin-sensitive patients.
Azinomycins A and B, isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces griseofuscus S 42227, were examined for antitumor activities against P388 leukemia, P815 mastocytoma, B-16 melanoma, Ehrlich carcinoma, Lewis lung carcinoma and Meth A fibrosarcoma. Azinomycin B was markedly effective against the intraperitoneally inoculated tumors such as P388 leukemia, B-16 melanoma and Ehrlich carcinoma. The intraperitoneal administration of azinomycin B showed 57% survivors for 45 days and 193% ILS against P388 leukemia. For Ehrlich carcinoma, azinomycin B gave 161% ILS and 63% survivors for 45 days, but solid tumors such as Lewis lung carcinoma and Meth A fibrosarcoma were not susceptible to repeated injection of this substance. Azinomycin A was somewhat less effective than azinomycin B for the tumor systems tested.
The effects of a 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3)-receptor antagonist KB-R6933 (6-amino-5-chloro-1-isopropyl-2-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-benzimidazole dimaleate) on experimental diarrhea and on intestinal fluid secretion stimulated by cholera toxin were examined and compared with those of ramosetron and loperamide. KB-R6933 and ramosetron (0.03-1 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the diarrhea induced by 5-HT, but not that by castor oil or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), in mice. Loperamide significantly inhibited the diarrhea induced by 5-HT, castor oil and PGE2. All drugs tested inhibited the diarrhea induced by restraint stress and the intestinal fluid secretion stimulated by cholera toxin in rats. The results suggest the possibility that KB-R6933 may have clinical efficacy in the treatment of diarrhea.
This screening trial evaluated whether the GABAB agonist baclofen demonstrated sufficient clinical efficacy to recommend an adequately powered trial of the medication as a pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence.
Participants with cocaine dependence verified by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV were randomly assigned to baclofen (N = 35; 20 mg t.i.d.) or placebo conditions (N = 35; identical in appearance and dosage rate) using a 2-group, experimental, 16-week double-blind design featuring thrice-weekly cognitive-behavioral drug counseling groups. Outcomes were retention, cocaine use, cocaine craving, and adverse events.
A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model showed that participants assigned to receive baclofen demonstrated statistically significant reductions in cocaine use over those assigned to receive placebo as indicated by urine drug screening results (chi(2) = 5.34, df = 1, p =.021). Confirming the GEE model, longitudinal analyses showed that participants assigned to receive baclofen demonstrated significant and stepwise increases in the probability of providing benzoylecgonine-free urine samples throughout the trial as the number of benzoylecgonine-positive samples increased during baseline (chi(2) = 10.63, df = 1, p =.001). Participants assigned to placebo demonstrated no such association. Univariate analyses of aggregates of urine drug screening showed generally favorable outcomes for baclofen, but not at statistically significant levels. There was no statistical significance observed for retention, cocaine craving, or incidence of reported adverse events by treatment condition.
Project findings demonstrated initial clinical efficacy of baclofen over placebo in reducing cocaine use when delivered concurrent with thrice-weekly drug abuse counseling sessions. The effects of baclofen were particularly apparent for those participants with chronic levels of cocaine use at baseline and provide support for a full-scale efficacy trial for baclofen, especially among this subgroup of patients.
Arriving at a diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis is a multistep procedure including the establishing of contact allergy, demonstration of current exposure to the sensitizer, and assessment of clinical relevance. Sometimes, these steps are easy to get through; at other times, there may be problems with every step.
To demonstrate the possible difficulties and pitfalls in establishing the presence of contact allergy and diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis from exposure to the preservative methyldibromoglutaronitrile (MDBGN).
Simultaneous patch-testing with petrolatum preparations of MDBGN at various concentrations, use testing, and chemical analysis with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Contact allergy to MDBGN was established in two cases, with MDBGN in petrolatum at 0.5%. Results of HPLC investigation of moisturizers used by the patients and yielding positive results on patch and use tests disagreed with the information about preservatives on the labels of the moisturizers and with the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).
Patch testing with MDBGN in petrolatum at a concentration of less than 0.5% may fail to diagnose a clinically relevant contact allergy. The information on labels of products, on MSDSs, and from manufacturers may not be reliable, which indicates the need for chemical analyses.
Antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) targeting the Nav 1.8 sodium channel have been reported to decrease inflammatory hyperalgesia and L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation-induced mechanical allodynia in rats. The present studies were conducted to further characterize Nav 1.8 AS antinociceptive profile in rats to better understand the role of Nav 1.8 in different pain states. Consistent with earlier reports, chronic intrathecal Nav 1.8 AS, but not mismatch (MM), ODN decreased TTX-resistant sodium current density (by 60.5+/-10.2% relative to MM; p<0.05) in neurons from L4 to L5 dorsal root ganglia and significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia following intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant. In addition, 10 days following chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, Nav 1.8 AS, but not MM, ODN also attenuated mechanical allodynia (54.3+/-8.2% effect, p<0.05 vs. MM) 2 days after initiation of ODN treatment. The anti-allodynic effects remained for the duration of the AS treatment, and CCI rats returned to an allodynic state 4 days after discontinuing AS. In contrast, Nav 1.8 AS ODN failed to reduce mechanical allodynia in the vincristine chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain model or a skin-incision model of post-operative pain. Finally, Nav 1.8 AS, but not MM, ODN treatment produced a small but significant attenuation of acute noxious mechanical sensitivity in naïve animals (17.6+/-6.2% effect, p<0.05 vs. MM). These data demonstrate a greater involvement of Nav 1.8 in frank nerve injury and inflammatory pain as compared to acute, post-operative or chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain states.
The pharmacologic effects of intrathecal sufentanil (ITS) beyond what is clinically administered (10 microg) are not known. We observed 18 healthy, young, adult female volunteers who received 12.5, 25, or 50 microg of ITS in a randomized, double-blind fashion for 11 h. Analgesia was assessed by pressure algometry at the tibia. Respiratory function was assessed by pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, arterial blood gas, the ventilatory response to CO2, and a respiratory intervention score (RIS). The incidence and severity of side effects also were documented. Serum sufentanil levels were measured for 4 h after ITS administration. We found that ITS produced statistically significant changes in algometry, doubling the pressure required to produce moderate pain. However, doses of ITS greater than 12.5 microg failed to produce proportionate increases in the duration or intensity of analgesia. All doses of ITS produced significant respiratory depression, but only the RIS was significantly related to ITS dose. Neither respiratory rate nor sedation reliably predicted hypoxemia. Supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula consistently prevented pulse oximeter readings below 90%. Serum sufentanil concentrations were related to ITS dose in a statistically significant manner, reached clinically significant concentrations, and followed a time course similar to analgesia and measures of respiratory depression. However, there was no significant increase in measured analgesia associated with the increases in serum sufentanil concentrations. We conclude that in our volunteer model of lower extremity pain, administering ITS in doses larger than 12.5 microg does not improve the speed of onset, magnitude, or duration of analgesia and only causes dose-related increases in serum sufentanil concentrations, which may augment respiratory depression.
