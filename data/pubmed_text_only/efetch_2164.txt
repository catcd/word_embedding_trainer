To describe the effects of enteral naloxone used to treat opioid-induced constipation in pediatric intensive care patients.
Retrospective chart review.
Pediatric intensive care unit.
Twenty-three patients who received opioid therapy and enteral naloxone in our institution from January 2003 to February 2004 were compared with a randomly sampled control group matched for age, weight, sex, and length of stay who received opioids but had not received enteral naloxone.
None.
Daily stool output, daily opiate usage, nutrition, adjuvant laxative use, and side effects were assessed.
Patients stayed an average of 5 days (range, 0-13 days) in the pediatric intensive care unit before enteral administration of naloxone was instituted and received it for an average of 9 consecutive days (range, 3-30 days). Mean stool output for study patients before administration of enteral naloxone was 0.14 +/- 0.38 stools per day, whereas after its initiation it was 1.60 +/- 1.14 stools per day (p < .001). However, two patients developed significant opiate withdrawal symptoms after receiving enteral naloxone. The average stool output for control patients was 0.53 +/- 1.21 stools per day.
Enteral naloxone may be effective in increasing stool output in opioid-induced constipation but carries the risk of introducing withdrawal symptoms. Further studies are needed to evaluate this agent for opioid-induced constipation in the intensive care unit.
Acute interstitial nephritis associated with hepatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, fever and eosinophilia is uncommon. The syndrome has been described previously in association with phenindione administration, leptospirosis and heavy metal poisoning. Four cases are described, two of which were due to phenindione sensitivity. The other two patients had been exposed to a number of toxins including allopurinol, frusemide, chlorothiazide and methyldopa so that the exact aetiological agent is unclear. Interstitial nephritis should be considered as a cause of acute renal failure in patients with other features of drug hypersensitivity.
Adverse pulmonary reactions to some nitrofuran antibiotics are thought, in part, to involve production of reactive oxygen radicals. Furazolidone, a nitrofuran antibiotic, causes a dilated cardiomyopathy in domestic turkeys. The mechanism of this drug induced cardiomyopathy is unknown. We investigated the possible role of free radical injury in this heart failure model. Left ventricular lipid peroxidation capacity, assessed by two methods (the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid hydroperoxides assays respectively), was investigated in five 5-8 week old cardiomyopathic turkeys with severe cardiac dilatation, left ventricular dysfunction and systemic hypotension, and in five control birds. Superoxide dismutase activity, total and manganese, was also measured in the crude left ventricular homogenates. Both lipid peroxidation products were reduced in the myopathic hearts: thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (malondialdehyde) 70(SEM 4) v 86(3) nmol.100 mg protein-1 in controls, p less than 0.02; and lipid hydroperoxides 29(7) v 74(14) nmol.100 mg protein-1, p less than 0.02. Total superoxide dismutase activity was similar in cardiomyopathic and control hearts: 670(26) v 657(105) nitrite units.100 mg protein-1. Although total superoxide dismutase activity was unchanged, we found decreased manganese superoxide dismutase in the dilated hearts compared with controls (54% v 84% of total activity, p less than 0.02). In separate in vitro experiments furazolidone (2-10 mg.g wet weight-1) did not increase malondialdehyde production in turkey (or rat) left ventricular homogenates. These results indicate that cardiomyopathy induced by furazolidone is associated with decreased myocardial lipid peroxidation. Although as yet unexplained, the decrease may be due to a diminished amount of heart lipid susceptible to peroxidation accompanying the process of cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Agranulocytosis or allergic skin reactions are common side effects of antithyroid drugs. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis is very uncommon.
We report a 29-year-old woman treated with propylthiouracil for Graves' disease who developed a vasculitic skin involvement. ANCA with antimyeloperoxidase specificity were documented. Symptoms resolved after discontinuation of the drug.
ANCA associated vasculitis is an unusual complication of propylthiouracil. Prognosis is conditioned by renal and pulmonary involvement.
Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and proteinase 3 (PR3) are structurally and functionally related. PR3 is the prominent target antigen for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). Reported frequencies of HNE ANCAs in WG and other autoimmune diseases range from 0% to 20%. We previously detected HNE ANCAs in patients with cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions (CIMDL). We tested the hypothesis that discrepancies in the reported frequencies of HNE ANCAs in patients with vasculitis may be related to differences in detection methods, and that HNE ANCA may be a marker for CIMDL.
HNE ANCA reactivity in 25 patients with CIMDL was characterized and compared with that in a control cohort of 604 consecutive patients (64 with WG, 14 with microscopic polyangiitis [MPA], and 526 others) and 45 healthy volunteers. HNE ANCAs were measured by indirect immunofluorescence using a previously undescribed expression system for recombinant HNE and by direct and capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using purified native HNE as target antigen.
Among patients with CIMDL, HNE ANCAs were detectable by 1 assay in 84%, by 2 assays in 68%, and by all 3 assays in 36%. Fifty-seven percent of HNE ANCA-positive CIMDL sera were also PR3 ANCA-positive by at least 1 assay. In contrast, only 8 (1.3%) of 604 control sera reacted with HNE in at least 1 assay, 3 (0.5%) reacted in 2 assays, and only 1 serum sample (0.16%) reacted in all 3 assays. Sera obtained from patients with WG or MPA were universally HNE ANCA-negative, as were sera obtained from healthy controls.
Optimal sensitivity for HNE ANCA requires multimodality testing. HNE ANCAs are frequent in CIMDL but not in other autoimmune diseases, including classic ANCA-associated vasculitis. HNE ANCAs may discriminate between CIMDL and WG, whereas a positive test result for PR3 ANCA may not.
The primary purpose of the present set of studies was to provide a direct comparison of the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan on body composition, physical performance, and muscle quality when administered late in life to aged rats. Overall, enalapril treatment consistently attenuated age-related increases in adiposity relative to both placebo and losartan. The maximal effect was achieved after 3 months of treatment (between 24 and 27 months of age), at a dose of 40 mg/kg and was observed in the absence of any changes in physical activity, body temperature, or food intake. In addition, the reduction in fat mass was not due to changes in pathology given that enalapril attenuated age-related increases in tumor development relative to placebo- and losartan-treated animals. Both enalapril and losartan attenuated age-related decreases in grip strength, suggesting that changes in body composition appear dissociated from improvements in physical function and may reflect a differential impact of enalapril and losartan on muscle quality. To link changes in adiposity to improvements in skeletal muscle quality, we performed gene array analyses to generate hypotheses regarding cell signaling pathways altered with enalapril treatment. Based on these results, our primary follow-up pathway was mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of myocytes. Relative to losartan- and placebo-treated rats, only enalapril decreased DNA fragmentation and caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling. These data suggest that attenuation of the severity of skeletal muscle apoptosis promoted by enalapril may represent a distinct mechanism through which this compound improves muscle strength/quality.
The levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and other substances of coagulation-fibrinolysis, such as fibronectin (Fn) and von willebrand factor (vWF) as well as the activity content of antithrombin-III(AT-III) in plasma were determined in 20 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In 11 of them these measurements were carried out before and after the treatment with urokinase (UK1000 000 IU). The results suggested that the function of coagulation-fibrinolytic system was disturbed in AMI. Thrombolytic treatment with UK could interfere and improve the stabilization of fibrinolytic activity in the body, but these actions last only short time. Some substances of coagulation showed change with UK treatment.
In the present study, three different dopamine antagonists were challenged in order to counteract hyperactivity induced by 50 mg/kg of morphine. A wide range of doses of morphine (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, or 3.12 mg/kg) were evaluated on spontaneous locomotor activity. A significant increase was observed only with the two higher doses tested (25 and 50 mg/kg). No decrease was found with any of the doses used at any period of time. After analyzing doses of SCH 23390 (0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 mg/kg), raclopride (0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 mg/kg) administered alone, only the 0.5 mg/kg dose of SCH 23390 decreased locomotor activity. The three compounds counteracted morphine-induced hyperactivity, but with SCH 23390 it was only achieved with the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, which also decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and induced catalepsy. On the other hand, raclopride and risperidone neutralized morphine-induced hyperactivity at doses that did not affect locomotor activity, although the former induced catalepsy when administered with morphine. It is concluded that although the blockade of D(1) and D(2) DA receptors decreases morphine-induced hyperactivity, this action is not specific, contrary to the action of risperidone, which counteracts this hyperactivity without any other motor effects.
Glucagon and its receptors have been identified within the mammalian brain, and their anatomical distribution correlates well with the distribution of opioid peptides and their receptors. To evaluate possible physiological interactions between these two peptidergic systems, we examined the effects of glucagon on two opioid responses - bradycardia and antinociception. Glucagon administered either intravenously (iv) (100-1000 micrograms/kg) or intracerebroventricularly (icv) (5 micrograms) significantly attenuated morphine-induced (200 micrograms/kg, iv) bradycardia without producing any alterations in cardiovascular parameters when given alone. Furthermore, glucagon did not antagonize the bradycardia produced by phenyldiguanide (10 micrograms/kg, iv), a non-opioid substance. Peripheral (1 mg/kg, iv) and central (5 micrograms, icv) glucagon pretreatment antagonized morphine-induced (7.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) antinociception by 67% and 86%, respectively, at 30 minutes (as determined by the hot plate test). Glucagon treatment alone at these doses did not alter baseline response latencies. In both cases, central injections of glucagon were more effective than iv injections in antagonizing morphine's effects. These findings demonstrate a central action for glucagon and provide the first evidence that this neuropeptide may function as an endogenous antagonist of opioid actions.
We investigated whether the prevention of the development of diabetic nephropathy by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with decreases in renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and/or blood pressure in diabetic mice. C57Bl/6 mice were injected with streptozotocin (200 mg/kg, i.v.) and randomized to receive either imidapril (1 and 5 mg/kg) or captopril (10 and 50 mg/kg) or vehicle by gavage for 28 days. Each assay was performed on 8-10 mice from each treatment. At 28 days after the start of drug treatment, imidapril and captopril significantly reduced blood pressure of the diabetic mice, and this effect of captopril was stronger than that of imidapril. On the other hand, inhibition of renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity by imidapril was stronger than that by captopril. Imidapril and captopril dose-dependently inhibited urinary albumin excretion to similar extents, but they failed to inhibit the renal hypertrophy and elevation of creatinine clearance. Total renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was significantly reduced in diabetic mice, but immunohistochemical localization of angiotensin-converting enzyme was intensive in the vasculature and glomeruli of the diabetic kidney. In conclusion, both effects on blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity may be involved in the prevention of development of diabetic nephropathy by imidapril and captopril in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The data suggest that the degrees of contribution of their effects on blood pressure and renal angiotensin-converting enzyme activity to the inhibition of urinary albumin excretion may be different between the two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
A case is presented of a patient who described a koro-like syndrome related to amfetamine use; this consisted of a perception that his penis had reduced in size and was at risk of being sucked into his body. He described this as Whizz-Dick. This condition was also reported independently by amfetamine users attending a drug-addiction clinic. They described Whizz-Dick as a temporary penile shrinkage secondary to amfetamine use. Descriptions of penile shrinkage related to amfetamine in literature and from Internet sources are described. The relationship between Whizz-Dick and koro and its possible links with other psychosexual problems previously reported to be associated with amfetamine use are discussed.
Previous studies using a cardiac-specific metallothionein (MT)-overexpressing transgenic (MT-TG) mouse model have demonstrated that MT protects from doxorubicin (DOX)-induced oxidative heart injury. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this cardioprotection, however, have yet to be defined. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that MT overexpression activates cytoprotective mechanisms, leading to cardiac protection from DOX toxicity. MT-TG mice and nontransgenic wild-type (WT) controls were treated i.p. with DOX at a single dose of 20 mg/kg and sacrificed on the third day after the treatment. An expression proteomic analysis involving two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify MT-induced changes in cytoprotection-related proteins. We identified 18 proteins that were modified by DOX treatment in the heart. These proteins included those involved in cellular antioxidant defense, enzymes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, enzymes involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids and glycolysis, and proteins involved in regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. However, the most dominant modification by MT is the cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (CCO-Va). In response to DOX treatment, a specific isoform of CCO-Va was enhanced in the MT-TG but not in the WT mouse hearts. Because CCO-Va is a critical component in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, the results suggest that the cardioprotective effect of MT may be related to an increased expression or a differential modification of CCO-Va.
The authors report a case of severe pulmonary hypertension after long-term dexfenfluramine treatment in a 48 year old man with no previous medical history. Dexfenfluramine, which has previously been reported to cause pulmonary hypertension, is an amphetamine-like anorexic agent, a pharmacological group known to predispose to this type of side effect. The possibility of this complication should be born in mind before prescribing the drug. In particular, it would seem to be particularly important not to exceed the recommended length of treatment especially as potential reversibility of pulmonary hypertension on withdrawal of the drug has been reported in one case.
Arsenite treatment of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells leads to an upregulation of caspase-3/7 activity and to the fragmentation of chromatin that is accompanied by elevated p53 and c-Jun levels. Expression of a truncated mutant of p53, p53DD, which interfered with the oligomerization of p53, suppressed the arsenite-induced upregulation of caspase-3/7 activity and the fragmentation of chromatin, indicating that p53 is required for arsenite-induced cell death. These data were corroborated by knockdown experiments of p53 following expression of a p53-specific short hairpin RNA. Likewise, expression of either p53DD or knockdown of p53 prevented caspase-3/7 activation and chromatin fragmentation induced by nutlin-3, a compound that prevents the interaction between p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Transcriptional upregulation of a chromatin-embedded p53-responsive reporter gene in either arsenite or nutlin-3 stimulated neuroblastoma cells revealed that the transcriptional activity of p53 was increased under these conditions. Expression of a c-Jun-specific short hairpin RNA failed to impair arsenite-induced caspase-3/7 activation and fragmentation of chromatin. Likewise, inhibition of c-Jun target gene expression by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun did not interfere with arsenite-induced caspase-3/7 activation and chromatin fragmentation. However, this approach successfully reduced caspase-3/7 activity induced as a result of forced expression of a constitutively active mutant of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase (MEKK)-1. Together, these data show that the upregulation of p53 is causally linked with arsenite-induced cell death in neuroblastoma cells, whereas the upregulation of c-Jun is not part of this apoptotic signaling cascade.
We reported that dihydrocapsaicin (DHC) induces autophagy in a catalase-regulated manner. In this study, we further examined the role of DHC-induced autophagy in lung cell lines. DHC-induced cytotoxicity was higher in WI38 and H1299 cells than in H460 and A549 cells, and was related to the loss of cell membrane integrity. However, apoptotic cells markedly increased in H460 and A549 cells. In WI38 and H1299 cells, DHC-induced catalase was correlated with a decrease of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an increase in the level of LC3II, an autophagy marker, and LC3 conversion was attenuated by the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) or by knockdown of the catalase gene. In A549 cells, DHC downregulated catalase, led to ROS accumulation, and blocked LC3 conversion. In H460 cells expressing limited amount of catalase, DHC caused ROS accumulation and blocked LC3 conversion. However, H460 cells overexpressing catalase were able to induce autophagy. In contrast to Earle's balanced salt solution and rotenone, H(2)O(2) treatment caused ROS accumulation and did not promote upregulation of catalase and LC3II in lung cell lines. Cytoplasmic vacuolization in WI38 and H1299 cells was blocked by treatment of 3AT and which enhanced caspase-3 activity and LDH release. Suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine also enhanced DHC-induced cell death through apoptotic and necrotic cell death. In A549 and H460 cells, treatment of rapamycin attenuated DHC-induced cell death. Collectively, these results suggest that catalase regulates autophagy, which helps protect cells against apoptotic and necrotic cell death.
The possibility that compounds which interact with the putative sigma receptor might influence the dopaminergic neuropathology produced by the administration of methamphetamine (METH) to mice was investigated. (+/-)-BMY 14802 [alpha-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazine-butanol hydrochloride] attenuated METH-induced dopaminergic neuropathology whereas several other sigma-acting compounds such as R-(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-propylpiperidine hydrochloride, 1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine, rimcazole, clorgyline or (-)-butaclamol did not alter neurotoxicity produced by this central nervous system stimulant. (-)-BMY 14802, which has a lower affinity for the sigma site than (+)-BMY 14802, was more potent than (+)-BMY 14802 in antagonizing METH-induced neuropathology. In addition, the ketone metabolite (BMY 14786; alpha-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazine-butanone hydrochloride), which is a major metabolite formed from (-)-BMY 14802, also attenuated the METH-induced effects. (+/-)-BMY 14802 pretreatment of mice prevented the reduction in D1 and D2 dopamine receptor number produced by the systemic administration of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline and demonstrates that (+/-)-BMY 14802 and/or its metabolites interact with the dopamine receptor subtypes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the protective effect of (+/-)-BMY 14802 against METH-induced neuropathology is mediated, at least in part, through dopamine receptor antagonism. Furthermore, the failure of other sigma-acting compounds to alter METH-induced neurotoxicity indicates that the putative sigma receptor is unlikely to be an important mediator in this type of neuropathology.
Recent studies in several tumor models indicated that treatment with angiogenic inhibitors may trigger induction of metastasis to other organs. Here we investigated modes of resistance and invasion in several tumor cell lines including 4T1 (breast), H460 (lung) and Colo205 (colorectal) using sunitinib at doses comparable to clinically utilized regimen. In comparison with vehicle-treated tumors, sunitinib increased metastasis to lung in 4T1 tumors and to peritoneal lymph node in Colo205 tumors. However, the same treatment did not induce invasiveness in H460 tumors, further suggesting that accelerating metastasis during treatment with angiogenic inhibitors is tumor cell-type dependent. Interestingly, Crizotinib (a dual inhibitor of c-Met and ALK pathways) as single agent or in combination with sunitinib reduced metastasis in all models tested suggesting a role for c-Met/HGF pathway in intrinsic- or sunitinib-induced-metastasis. Moreover, ELISA data showed that while c-Met is highly enriched in tumor cells, HGF is secreted mainly by the stroma (mouse HGF) suggesting a paracrine fashion for c-Met pathway activation in the tumors. In conclusion, our findings indicate that sunitinib-induced metastasis is tumor cell-type dependent and further supports a rationale for combination of anti-angiogenics and c-Met inhibition in the clinic.
Trastuzumab provides considerable therapeutic benefits in the adjuvant setting of breast cancer. However, its use is limited by an elevated incidence of cardiotoxicity when used in combination with doxorubicin. Although Myocet (liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin) is less cardiotoxic, its cardiac safety profile with trastuzumab is not well known. The aim of this study was to determine if sensitive indices of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, specifically Doppler tissue imaging (DTI), would be useful for addressing the early detection of trastuzumab and anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity.
In an acute murine model, wild-type C57Bl/6 mice (n = 60) received one of the following drug regimens: (1) control, (2) doxorubicin, (3) Myocet, (4) trastuzumab, (5) doxorubicin plus trastuzumab, or (6) Myocet plus trastuzumab. DTI-derived peak endocardial systolic velocity, strain rate, and LV ejection fraction were measured serially for 5 days. On day 5, the hearts, lungs, and livers were removed for histopathologic and Western blot analyses.
Mice treated with Myocet plus trastuzumab demonstrated minimal cardiotoxicity compared with those treated with doxorubicin plus trastuzumab. Progressive LV dilatation and LV systolic dysfunction were observed by day 4 of treatment with doxorubicin plus trastuzumab, compared with preserved LV ejection fraction in the remaining groups. DTI parameters decreased within 24 hours in the doxorubicin alone and doxorubicin plus trastuzumab groups and predicted early mortality. The survival rate was only 20% at day 5 of the experiment in the doxorubicin plus trastuzumab group, whereas 100% of mice receiving trastuzumab, Myocet, or Myocet plus trastuzumab survived the 5 days.
DTI can detect early LV dysfunction prior to alterations in conventional echocardiographic indices and predicts early mortality in mice receiving doxorubicin plus trastuzumab.
The Fischer (F344) and Lewis (LEW) inbred rat strains differ on a number of behaviors, including those induced by a variety of drugs of abuse. Although a number of physiological and biochemical differences between the strains have been reported following both single and repeated drug administration, studies assessing changes in the affective properties of drugs after repeated exposure are limited. To that end, using the F344 and LEW strains, the present study examined the effects of repeated exposure to cocaine on the subsequent acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned taste aversions, a preparation often used in assessing the development of tolerance to the drug's aversive effects. Specifically, separate groups of male F344 and LEW rats received five injections of 32 mg/kg cocaine (or vehicle) prior to taste aversion conditioning with 32 mg/kg cocaine (or vehicle). Vehicle-preexposed subjects of both strains acquired aversions to the cocaine-associated taste with no differences in the strength of the aversions. Further, cocaine-preexposed subjects displayed significantly attenuated aversions, an effect consistent with prior work with outbred animals. There was no difference between the two strains in this attenuation, suggesting that there were no genotype-specific differences in tolerance to cocaine's aversive effects. The data were discussed in relation to genetic/environmental interactions in the vulnerability to drugs of abuse.
The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after a high-dose regimen of busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa and the risk factors for a more severe outcome. We followed 253 consecutive patients with malignant disorders who received autologous transplants after stem cell harvest followed by 12 mg/kg busulfan, 100 mg/m2 melphalan, and 500 mg/m2 thiotepa. Diagnosis of VOD was based on weight gain, hepatomegaly, and jaundice. Risk factors for moderate or severe VOD were identified using logistic regression models. VOD occurred in 70 of 253 patients (28%), of whom 31 (12%) had moderate and 11 (4%) severe VOD. The median day of onset of hyperbilirubinemia was day 9, significantly later than the onset of jaundice after our cyclophosphamide-based regimens (p < 0.001). Resolution of weight gain and jaundice, followed by their reappearance several weeks later, occurred in 23 of 70 patients with VOD and was an adverse prognostic sign. Risk factors for moderate or severe VOD were a diagnosis of lymphoma or myeloma (odds ratio [OR] 2.65 compared with breast cancer), tumor involvement in the liver (OR 3.95), fever in the month before transplant (OR 3.32), and prior radiation therapy (OR 2.70). We conclude that VOD after busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa was less frequent and less severe and developed later than VOD after our historical cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Significant risk factors included a diagnosis other than breast cancer, hepatic metastases, persistent fever, and prior radiation therapy. This study suggests that alkylating agents of comparable overall toxicity differ in their liver toxicity.
Psychostimulant-induced locomotor sensitization and disrupted latent inhibition (LI) of a classically conditioned association are two paradigms that have been widely studied as animal behavioural models of psychosis. In this study we assessed the effects of withdrawal from the repeated intermittent administration of cocaine on LI of a conditioned fear response. Animals which were either preexposed (PE) to a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) or naive to the tone (i.e. non-preexposed: NPE) subsequently experienced 10 pairings of the tone CS with footshock. Afterwards, both groups received five daily injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. After 3 days of withdrawal from drug treatment, animals were tested for conditioned freezing to the context of the footshock chamber, and 1 day later, for conditioned freezing to the tone CS. Cocaine-sensitized animals exhibited markedly enhanced LI compared to saline-treated animals, due to the fact that NPE-cocaine animals spent more time freezing during the tone CS than NPE-saline animals, whereas PE-cocaine animals showed a tendency toward reduced freezing compared to the saline groups. While these results suggest the presence of increased anxiety in cocaine-withdrawn NPE animals, the absence of this effect in cocaine-withdrawn PE rats indicates that cocaine withdrawal also influences the retrieval of previously learned information.
Acquisition and dose-related self-administration of heroin (H)/cocaine (C) combinations in C57BL/6 x SJL mice were studied in nose-poke or lever-press operant responding procedures. C57BL/6 x SJL mice readily acquired self-administration in both operant procedures with a combination of doses known to be ineffective when each drug was used alone (H: 15 microg/kg and C: 150 microg/kg per injection). Similar numbers of infusions were obtained under conditions of fixed-ratio (FR) 3 versus 1 for the nose-poke and lever-press responses, respectively. Dose-effect curves for heroin:cocaine combinations revealed a pattern corresponding to a leftward shift of the dose-response for intravenous cocaine self-administration. Curves were similar whether generated with 1 or 3 days of availability per dose, or including subjects that did not respond preferentially (> 70% responses) to the hole or lever associated with drug delivery, along with those that did. Motor activity induced by a combination of low doses for each drug was examined (H: 0.375 mg/kg and C: 3.75 mg/kg, i.p.). Under these conditions, the combination of both drugs induced an initial cocaine-like stimulation of horizontal activity, in contrast to the tendency of heroin to decrease activity. It is concluded that heroin:cocaine combinations used in the present study had reinforcing effects in C57BL/6 x SJL mice, and produced a cocaine-like effect in the early part of drug-induced activity sessions, followed by a locomotor profile corresponding to the average of both drugs.
The mitochondria are a critical target for cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity. Though nitric oxide formation has been implicated in the toxicity of cisplatin, this formation has not so far been related to a possible activation of mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mNOS). We show here that the upregulation of oxide mNOS and peroxynitrite formation in cisplatin treatment are key events that influence the development of the harmful parameters described in cisplatin-associated kidney failure. We confirm this by isolating the mitochondrial fraction of the kidney and across different access routes such as the use of a specific inhibitor of neuronal NOS, L-NPA, a peroxynitrite scavenger, FeTMPyP, and a peroxynitrite donor, SIN-1. The in vitro studies corroborated the information obtained in the in vivo experiments. The administration of cisplatin reveals a clear upregulation in the transcription of neuronal NOS and an increase in the levels of nitrites in the mitochondrial fractions of the kidneys. The upregulated transcription directly affects the cytoskeleton structure and the apoptosis. The inhibition of neuronal NOS reduces the levels of nitrites, cell death, and cytoskeleton derangement. Peroxynitrite is involved in the mechanism promoting the NOS transcription. In addition, in controls SIN-1 imitates the effects of cisplatin. In summary, we demonstrate that upregulation of mNOS in cisplatin treatment is a key component in both the initiation and the spread of cisplatin-associated damage in the kidney. Furthermore, peroxynitrite formation is directly involved in this process.
This study describes the effect of heparin on blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance in spontaneously hypertensive and one-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. Administration of heparin (200 units/day/rat) for 8 weeks to young (6-week-old) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) resulted in an attenuated rise in blood pressure; mean blood pressure in heparin-treated SHR (180 +/- mm Hg) was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that in control SHR (205 +/- 7 mm Hg). Similar heparin treatment started immediately after the induction of one-kidney, one clip (Goldblatt) hypertension reduced the rise in blood pressure. After 4 weeks of treatment, heparin-treated Goldblatt hypertensive rats had much lower blood pressure (150 +/- 4 mm Hg) than did control rats (7178 +/- 8 mm Hg). The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.01). Similarly, heparin treatment also lowered the blood pressure in rats with developed Goldblatt hypertension. After the cessation of heparin treatment, the blood pressure returned to pretreatment level in these rats. When compared to vehicle-treated rats, heparin-treated animals with either spontaneous or Goldblatt hypertension concomitantly exhibited a significant increase in cardiac output, and significant decreases in total peripheral resistance and packed cell volume. Further, the left ventricular weight to body weight ratio was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in heparin-treated than control animals. Since a relationship seems to exist between an increase in packed cell volume and blood viscosity and the rise in arterial pressure, this blood-pressure-lowering effect of heparin may be attributed to a decrease in packed cell volume.
