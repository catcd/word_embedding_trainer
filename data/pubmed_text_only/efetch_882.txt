To determine whether topical ocular chloramphenicol increases the risk of aplastic anaemia and to estimate the magnitude of this risk, if any.
Population-based prospective case-control surveillance of aplastic anaemia in a community of 4.2 million inhabitants from 1980 to 1995 (67.2 million person-years) plus case-population estimate of the risk, based on sales figures of ocular chloramphenicol in the study area during the study period.
One hundred and forty-five patients with aplastic anaemia and 1,226 controls were included in the analysis. Three cases (2.1%) and 5 controls (0.4%) had been exposed to ocular chloramphenicol during the relevant etiological period. The adjusted odds ratio was 3.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-16.90). Two cases had also been exposed to other known causes of aplastic anaemia. The incidence of aplastic anaemia among users of ocular chloramphenicol was 0.36 cases per million weeks of treatment. The incidence among non users was 0.04 cases per million weeks.
An association between ocular chloramphenicol and aplastic anaemia cannot be excluded. However, the risk is less than one per million treatment courses.
Transglutaminase 2 (TG2, a.k.a. tissue transglutaminase) belongs to a family of transglutaminase enzymes that stabilize proteins by affecting covalent crosslinking via formation of amide bonds. Cell surface TG2 is directly involved as an adhesive receptor in cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Here, we show that TG2 activity is elevated in glioblastomas compared with non-neoplastic brain. Immunofluorescent studies showed increased staining of fibronectin colocalized with TG2 in the ECM in glioblastomas. In addition, small clusters of invading human glioblastoma cells present in non-neoplastic brain parenchyma secrete high levels of TG2 and fibronectin that distinguish them from normal brain stroma. Downregulation of TG2 in U87MG glioblastoma cells with RNAi demonstrated decreased assembly of fibronectin in the ECM. Treatment with KCC009 blocked the remodeling of fibronectin in the ECM in glioblastomas in both in vitro and in vivo studies. KCC009 treatment in mice harboring orthotopic glioblastomas (DBT-FG) sensitized the tumors to N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea chemotherapy, as measured by reduced bioluminescence, increased apoptosis and prolonged survival. The ability of KCC009 to interfere with the permissive remodeling of fibronectin in the ECM in glioblastomas suggests a novel target to enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy directed not only at the tumor mass, but also invading glioblastoma cells.
We describe a patient in whom two tachycardias with AV dissociation were inducible by ventricular extrastimulation. The first tachycardia was characterized by a narrow QRS preceded by a His deflection with an HV interval identical to that recorded in sinus rhythm (40 ms). Premature ventricular depolarization delivered when the His bundle was refractory advanced the next His deflection. These findings suggest the presence of a nodoventricular bypass tract involved in an orthodromic tachycardia. The second tachycardia was induced after propafenone infusion and exhibited a wide QRS complex with left bundle branch block morphology; each ventricular complex was consistently associated with a His deflection with a HV interval of -15 ms. The second tachycardia may be considered to represent an antidromic tachycardia through the nodoventricular tract. However, a ventricular tachycardia cannot be excluded.
Inorganic arsenic (iAs) and its high toxic metabolite, monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)), are able to induce malignant transformation of human cells. Chronic exposure to these chemicals is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple cancers in human. However, the mechanisms contributing to iAs/MMA(III)-induced cell malignant transformation and carcinogenesis are not fully elucidated. We recently showed that iAs/MMA(III) exposure to human cells led to a decreased level of histone acetylation globally, which was associated with an increased sensitivity to arsenic cytotoxicity. In the current study, it demonstrated that prolonged exposure to low-level MMA(III) in human urothelial cells significantly increased the expression and activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) with an associated reduction of histone acetylation levels both globally and lysine specifically. Administration of the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), at 4 weeks after the initial MMA(III) treatment inhibited the MMA(III)-mediated up-regulation of the expression and activities of HDACs, leading to increase histone acetylation and prevention of MMA(III)-induced malignant transformation. These new findings suggest that histone acetylation dysregulation may be a key mechanism in MMA(III)-induced malignant transformation and carcinogenesis, and that HDAC inhibitors could be targeted to prevent or treat iAs-related cancers.
This study was designed to investigate the mechanism by which (+-)-1,2-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazinyl-1-yl)propane (ICRF-187) protects against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Others have hypothesized that the major factor contributing to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is the depletion of the antioxidant defense mechanisms of the heart induced by doxorubicin. Mice were acutely (24-h exposure) or chronically (13-week exposure) treated with doxorubicin to develop a model for cardiotoxicity. Five-week-old BALB/c mice were given i.p. injections of doxorubicin alone or 30 min after ICRF-187, while control mice received ICRF-187 or 0.9% NaCl solution alone without doxorubicin. Electron microscopy of the mouse hearts demonstrated conclusively that doxorubicin was cardiotoxic after 13 weeks of exposure, showing mitochondrial degeneration and disruption of the myofibrillar organization. Furthermore, normal morphology of the electron micrographs after treatment with doxorubicin and ICRF-187 indicated that ICRF-187 was cardioprotective. The activities of the antioxidants superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase and the concentration of reduced glutathione were measured in the heart, liver, kidneys, and skeletal muscle of mice treated with doxorubicin, ICRF-187, or the drug combination. After acute or chronic exposure to the drugs there was no significant difference in enzyme or reduced glutathione levels compared to the control mice in any of the treatment groups. It was concluded that neither the cardioprotective effect of ICRF-187 nor the cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin was related to an effect on cardiac antioxidants, but rather another mechanism operated in this particular model.
Myotonia congenita is a nondystrophic muscle disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and muscle hypertrophy. The disorder can be inherited in an autosomal-dominant (Thomsen disease) or autosomal-recessive (Becker disease) manner. Both forms of myotonia congenita are attributable to mutations in the CLCN1 gene. Treatment with a variety of medications has led to long-term improvement in the clinical course of affected individuals. We describe a Honduran boy with myotonia congenita and a novel p.L287I mutation in the CLCN1 gene. The patient's unaffected father carries the same mutation, most likely reflecting autosomal-recessive myotonia congenita, with an inability to find a second mutation. The patient received carbamazepine treatment for 1 year, resulting in decreased muscle stiffness, increased strength, and improved quality of life in school and with peers.
Ciclopirox olamine (CPX), an off-patent antifungal agent used to treat mycoses of skin and nails, has recently been demonstrated to be a potential anticancer agent. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, for the first time, we show that CPX inhibited lymphangiogenesis in an in vitro model (tube formation). This effect was, in part, associated with inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) expression, as overexpression of VEGFR-3 conferred partial resistance to CPX inhibitory effect on tube formation in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), whereas downregulation of VEGFR-3 mimicked the effect of CPX, blocking the tube formation. Further study revealed that CPX did not alter mRNA level, but inhibited protein synthesis and promoted protein degradation of VEGFR-3. In addition, we found that CPX inhibited phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), a downstream effector of VEGFR-3. Overexpression of VEGFR-3 attenuated CPX inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas downregulation of VEGFR-3 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in LECs. Ectopic expression of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MKK1) resulted in activation of ERK1/2 and partially prevented CPX inhibition of LEC tube formation. The results suggest that CPX inhibits LEC tube formation at least, in part, through inhibiting VEGFR-3-mediated ERK signaling pathway.
Bioactive compounds from the medicinal plant, Eurycoma longifolia Jack have been shown to promote anti-proliferative effects on various cancer cell lines. Here we examined the effects of purified eurycomanone, a quassinoid found in Eurycoma longifolia Jack extract, on the expression of selected genes of the A549 lung cancer cells. Eurycomanone inhibited A549 lung cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 5 to 20 μg/ml. The concentration that inhibited 50% of cell growth (GI(50)) was 5.1 μg/ml. The anti-proliferative effects were not fully reversible following the removal of eurycomanone, in which 30% of cell inhibition still remained (p<0.0001, T-test). At 8 μg/ml (GI(70)), eurycomanone suppressed anchorage-independent growth of A549 cells by >25% (p<0.05, T-test, n=8) as determined using soft agar colony formation assay. Cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug used for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer on the other hand, inhibited A549 cells proliferation at concentrations ranging from 0.2 μg/ml to 15 μg/ml with a GI(50) of 0.58 μg/ml. The treatment with eurycomanone reduced the abundance expression of the lung cancer markers, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1, p53 tumor suppressor protein and other cancer-associated genes including prohibitin (PHB), annexin 1 (ANX1) and endoplasmic reticulum protein 28 (ERp28) but not the house keeping genes. The mRNA expressions of all genes with the exception of PHB were significantly downregulated, 72 h after treatment (p<0.05, T-test, n=9). These findings suggest that eurycomanone at viable therapeutic concentrations of 5-20 μg/ml exhibited significant anti-proliferative and anti-clonogenic cell growth effects on A549 lung cancer cells. The treatment also resulted in suppression of the lung cancer cell tumor markers and several known cancer cell growth-associated genes.
To evaluate the efficacy of methylprednisolone and urokinase pulse therapy (MUPT) for severe Henoch-Schönlein nephritis, we examined the clinical manifestation and prognosis of patients with MUPT on long-term observation.
We enrolled 56 patients with Henoch-schönlein nephritis who had been diagnosed with at least type IIIb from 1980 to 1998 on long-term observation and had been treated with MUPT. The clinical features, laboratory data, and pathologic findings between "pre-MUPT" and "post-MUPT," and the prognosis of these patients on long-term observation were retrospectively investigated.
The mean urinary protein excretion after 6 months of treatment had decreased significantly compared with "pre-MUPT." Hypercoagulant state in "after the completion of urokinase pulse therapy" improved compared with "pre-MUPT." First renal biopsies were performed in all patients and second biopsies were performed in 27 patients. The activity index decreased significantly from 4.1 +/- 1.9 at first biopsy to 2.5 +/- 1.7 at second biopsy, while the chronicity index did not differ between first and second biopsy. None had renal insufficiency and renal survival rate was 100% for the decade.
Although uncontrolled, our study suggested that MUPT is effective for those patients with the risk of progression of their nephropathy, especially if started early during the course of the disease before the crescents become fibrous.
The standard therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cryptococcal meningitis of amphotericin B (AmB; 0.7 mg/kg per day) plus flucytosine frequently takes >2 weeks to sterilize the cerebral spinal fluid, and acute mortality remains high. A dosage range for AmB of 0.7-1 mg/kg per day is noted in current guidelines, but there are no data comparing 0.7 mg/kg per day with 1 mg/kg per day.
Sixty-four HIV-seropositive, antiretroviral therapy-naive patients in Cape Town, South Africa, who experienced their first episode of cryptococcal meningitis during the period May 2005-June 2006 were randomized to receive either (1) AmB, 0.7 mg/kg per day, plus flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times per day (group 1; 30 patients); or (2) AmB, 1 mg/kg per day, plus flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times per day (group 2; 34 patients). Regimens were given for 2 weeks, followed by treatment with oral fluconazole. The primary outcome measure was early fungicidal activity, as determined by results of serial, quantitative cerebral spinal fluid cryptococcal cultures. Secondary outcome measures were safety and mortality. The median duration of follow-up was 1 year.
Early fungicidal activity was significantly greater for group 2 than for group 1 (mean +/- SD, -0.56 +/- 0.24 vs. -0.45 +/- 0.16 log cfu/mL of cerebral spinal fluid per day; P = .02). The incidence of renal impairment did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. Anemia was associated with female sex and, less strongly, with membership in group 2. Renal impairment and anemia reversed after the regimen was switched to fluconazole. Two- and 10-week mortality rates were 6% and 24%, respectively, with no difference between groups.
AmB, 1 mg/kg per day, plus flucytosine is more rapidly fungicidal than is standard-dose AmB plus flucytosine. Because of its size, this study provides limited data on any difference in toxicity between the regimens, but toxicities were manageable and reversible.

This study examines the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (PROZAC), on the ontogeny of spontaneous swimming activity (SSA) in developing zebrafish. The development of zebrafish motor behavior consists of four sequential locomotor patterns that develop over 1-5 days post fertilization (dpf), with the final pattern, SSA, established at 4-5 dpf. In stage specific experiments, larvae were exposed to 4.6 microM fluoxetine for 24 h periods beginning at 24 h post fertilization (hpf) and extending through 5 dpf. From 1-3 dpf, there was no effect on SSA or earlier stages of motor development, i.e., spontaneous coiling, evoked coiling and burst swimming. Fluoxetine exposure at 3 dpf for 24 h resulted in a transient decrease in SSA through 7 dpf with a complete recovery by 8 dpf. Larvae exposed to 4.6 microM fluoxetine for 24 h on 4 or 5 dpf showed a significant decrease in SSA by day 6 with no recovery through 14 dpf. Although SSA was significantly affected 24 h after fluoxetine exposure, there was little or no effect on pectoral fin movement. These results demonstrate both a stage specific and a long term effect of 4.6 microM fluoxetine exposure in 4 and 5 dpf larvae. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the relative levels of a serotonin transporter protein (SERT) transcript and the serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor transcript in developing embryos/larvae over 1-6 dpf. Both transcripts were present at 24 hpf with the relative concentration of SERT transcript showing no change over the developmental time range. The relative concentration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor transcript, however, showed a two-tiered pattern of concentration. RT-PCR was also used to detect potential changes in the SERT and 5-HT(1A) receptor transcripts in 6 dpf larvae after a 24 h exposure to 4.6 microM fluoxetine on 5 dpf. Three separate regions of the CNS were individually analyzed, two defined brain regions and spinal cord. The two brain regions showed no effect on transcript levels subsequent to fluoxetine exposure, however, the spinal cord showed a significant decrease in both transcripts. These results suggest a correlation between decreased concentration of SERT and 5-HT(1A) receptor transcripts in spinal cord and decreased SSA subsequent to fluoxetine exposure.
Using analytical subcellular fractionation techniques in combination with enzymic microanalysis, studies have been performed on the enzymology and organelle pathology of isolated glomeruli from normal rats and from animals with puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. There was a marked decrease in 5'-nucleotidase (plasma membrane) activity 2 days after puromycin aminonucleoside administration. In contrast, catalase (peroxisomes) and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (lysosomes) showed a significant rise during the first 6 days of treatment. By 10 days most marker enzymes showed a significant decrease in activity. The glomeruli were homogenized in isotonic sucrose and extracts were fractionated by isopycnic centrifugation on linear sucrose gradients in the Beaufay automatic small-volume zonal centrifuge. The properties of the principal organelles were characterized. ed. After 10 days of puromycin aminonucleoside treatment there were no marked differences in the centrifugal properties of these organelles. Morphological correlations with the biochemical changes are discussed and it is suggested that the plasma membrane changes represent the primary site of puromycin aminonucleoside damage.
Interleukin 5 (IL-5) has been suggested to be involved in the growth and differentiation of B cells and eosinophils. Especially, Ly-1+ B cells, which have been considered to produce autoantibodies, are selectively developed by this lymphokine in long-term bone marrow culture. To envisage the possible engagement of IL-5 in the development of these cells in vivo, transgenic mice carrying the mouse IL-5 gene ligated with a metallothionein promoter were generated. Transgenic mice carrying the IL-5 gene exhibited elevated levels of IL-5 in the serum and an increase in the levels of serum IgM and IgA. A massive eosinophilia in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen, and an infiltration of muscle and liver with eosinophils, were observed. When cadmium-containing saline was injected intraperitoneally into transgenic mice, IL-5 production was augmented about five times within 24 h, and a distinctive Ly-1+ B cell population became apparent in the spleen after 5 d. IL-5 receptors were detected on those cells by monoclonal antibodies against IL-5 receptors. Another interesting finding in these transgenic mice was an increase in polyreactive anti-DNA antibodies of IgM class. It is suggested, therefore, that aberrant expression of the IL-5 gene may induce accumulation of Ly-1+ B cells and eosinophils. Furthermore, this IL-5 transgenic mouse can be a model mouse for eosinophilia, and we can determine the role of IL-5 in the differentiation of Ly-1+ B cells and eosinophils by using this mouse.
We present the case of a 63-year-old man who developed a subaortic gradient of 182 mmHg during an echocardiographic pharmacological stress study with dobutamine.
The authors report two cases with roentgenomophologically established cerebellar atrophy caused by chronic diphenylhydantoin overdosing. Exact neuropsychiatric testing of epileptics treated with diphenylhydantoin for a long period of time is demanded, and it is recommended that in the case of long-time therapy a maximum daily dose of 0.3 g of diphenylhydantoin be not exceeded.
The Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS) is a multiple congenital malformation syndrome with craniosynostosis, radiohumeral synostosis, femoral bowing, choanal atresia or stenosis, joint contractures, urogenital abnormalities and, often, early death. Autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance have been postulated, as has fluconazole teratogenesis. Mutations in POR (P450 (cytochrome) oxidoreductase, an essential electron donor to enzymes participating in cholesterol biosynthesis), have been identified in some patients with the ABS phenotype. Recent evidence suggests that these mutations cause attenuated steroid hydroxylation, which in turn, causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) with ambiguous genitalia in both sexes and glucocorticoid deficiency. Here, we report on a new patient with findings of both ABS and CAH that further illustrates how low maternal estriol at prenatal screening can serve as a marker steroid facilitating early diagnosis.
Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) follow-up is based on subjective parameters. Using simplified quantitative cytology of nasal lavages (QNCs), we studied 20 ML patients, 10 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and 10 healthy subjects. Patients with ML were treated with antimony and followed up with otolaryngological examination plus QNCs for 6 months. At the first evaluation, the median total number of cells in ML patients (1,540,000) was greater than that in CL patients (215,000) or that in healthy subjects (250,000). Neutrophils were predominant in ML patients, in contrast to both sets of controls, in whom epithelial cells were more frequent. During treatment, we found a significant reduction in total nasal cell counts in ML patients who were cured, and encountered a switch in predominant cell type. The cytology of 2 patients who did not respond to antimony remained the same. It is therefore possible to detect nasal inflammation in ML patients through QNCs, which may indicate extension of mucosal involvement, providing an objective parameter to monitor therapy.
The role of peripheral catecholamines in mediating the pressor and tremorigenic effects of oxotremorine were investigated in conscious rats. At time of peak tremor intensity induced by oxotremorine, plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline were increased 3--4-fold. Tremor intensity was substantially reduced by either adrenal medullectomy, chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine, or injection of 2.5 mg/kg L-propranolol. The pressor response to oxotremorine was not reduced by adrenal denervation, which however prevented the usual rise in plasma adrenaline but not that of noradrenaline. It is concluded that central cholinergic receptor stimulation activates the sympatho-adrenal system. While both adrenaline and intact sympathetic nerves are necessary for the mediation of the full tremorigenic effect, the pressor response to oxotremorine is mainly due to the effect of noradrenaline on vascular alpha-receptors.
Seizures induced by pilocarpine (PILO) have proven to be a useful procedure for investigating the basic mechanisms essential for generation, spread and motor expression of seizures in rodents. Here we report the long-term effects of PILO in rats. Following PILO (380 mg/kg, IP), 3 distinct phases were observed: 1) an acute period which lasted 1-2 days which corresponds to the pattern of repetitive seizures and status epilepticus; 2) a silent period (4-44 days) characterized by a progressive return to normal EEG and behavior; and 3) a period of recurrent seizures which started 5-45 days after PILO and lasted up to 120 days. These seizures lasted up to 50-60 sec, recurred 2-3 times per week and were more frequent during the light period of the light-dark cycle. These serial events offer a new method to induce spontaneous recurrent seizures in rats.
