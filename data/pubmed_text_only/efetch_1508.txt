The P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R), a member of the ATP-gated ion channel family, is regarded as a promising target for therapy of immune-related diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and chronic pain. A group of novel protoberberine analogs (compounds 3-5), discovered by screening of chemical libraries, was here investigated with respect to their function as P2X(7)R antagonists. Compounds 3-5 non-competitively inhibited BzATP-induced ethidium ion influx into hP2X(7)-expressing HEK293 cells, with IC(50) values of 100-300nM. This antagonistic action on the channel further confirmed that both BzATP-induced inward currents and Ca(2+) influx were strongly inhibited by compounds 3-5 in patch-clamp and Ca(2+) influx assays. The antagonists also effectively suppressed downstream signaling of P2X(7) receptors including IL-1β release and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 proteins in hP2X(7)-expressing HEK293 cells or in differentiated human monocytes (THP-1 cells). Moreover, IL-2 secretion from CD3/CD28-stimulated Jurkat T cell was also dramatically inhibited by the antagonist. These results imply that novel protoberberine analogs may modulate P2X(7) receptor-mediated immune responses by allosteric inhibition of the receptor.
There is limited data on intestinal lipid absorption in the nephrotic syndrome. This study investigated whether the efficiency of intestinal lipid absorption is altered in nephrotic lymph-fistula rats. The nephrotic syndrome was induced in nine Sprague-Dawley rats by an i.v. injection of puromycin aminonucleoside in saline; seven control rats received saline only. At 10 to 14 days after injection, the main intestinal lymph duct was cannulated for collection of lymph. The duodenum was also cannulated and a fasting saline-glucose solution was infused overnight at 3 mL/h. The next day, the infusate was changed to a lipid emulsion that contained (14C) cholesterol and (3H)triglyceride (triolein) that was infused at 3 mL/h for 8 h. During the last hour of fasting and during the lipid infusion, lymph flow in the Nephrotic group averaged 0.6 mL/h higher than the Control group (P = 0.02). No significant differences were found between the two groups in recovery of infused radioactive cholesterol (P = 0.37) or triglyceride (P = 0.38) from the gastrointestinal lumen, small intestinal mucosa, or lymph. Lymphatic output of chemically measured cholesterol was also similar (P = 0.96). These results suggest that mucosal uptake and lymphatic output of cholesterol and triglyceride are not altered in the nephrotic syndrome.
To evaluate the relationship between head circumference, birth weight, and cocaine dose in healthy term and near-term newborns exposed to cocaine in utero.
We used radioimmune assay (RIAH) of cocaine metabolite in maternal hair to quantify third trimester cocaine exposure in 240 healthy newborn infants (gestational age: >36 weeks). Cocaine exposure was categorized into 3 levels: no exposure (n = 136), low cocaine exposure (n = 52; RIAH: 2-66 ng/10 mg hair), and high cocaine exposure (n = 52; RIAH: 81-4457 ng/10 mg hair). We collected information on maternal demographic characteristics, the pregnancy, and the use of substances through a structured interview and from the medical record.
Means of birth weight, length, and head circumference of infants with high cocaine exposure differed significantly from those with low exposure and no exposure, but were similar between low exposure and no exposure. We used a multiple linear regression model to assess the association between newborn head circumference and cocaine level, adjusting for the effects of birth weight; gestational age; infant sex; and several maternal factors, including height, weight gain during pregnancy, syphilis during pregnancy, and the use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and opiates during pregnancy. Only birth weight, sex, and high cocaine exposure were significantly associated with newborn head circumference. The predicted head circumference deficit associated with high cocaine exposure (.44 cm) represents 34% of the unadjusted difference (1.28 cm) between mean head circumferences of infants in the high cocaine exposure and no exposure groups.
Newborns exposed to a high level of cocaine in utero (RIAH: >81 ng/10 mg hair) exhibit asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation in which the head circumference is disproportionately smaller than would be predicted from the birth weight (head wasting). The deficit in head size associated with cocaine exposure may reflect the effects of a specific central nervous system insult that interferes with prenatal brain growth.
Porphyria cutanea tarda is a disorder of heme biosynthesis resulting from a defect or deficiency in the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Heme precursors accumulate in the blood, urine, stool, and skin, where exposure to sunlight results in the clinical manifestations. Porphyria cutanea tarda has been described in adult hemodialysis patients. The pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda in this population is thought to be related to the inability of hemodialysis to adequately clear porphyrin precursors, resulting in increased precursor serum levels, precursor skin deposition, and subsequent clinical manifestations. A proper diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda in hemodialysis patients requires fractionation of serum porphyrins. Normalization of the porphyrin profile and reversal of the dermal manifestations require the withdrawal of hepatotoxic agents and the reversal of hepatic iron overload. A case of porphyria cutanea tarda in an adult ESRD patient treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is described. In this patient, the disease was related to elevated serum levels of phenytoin, which had been administered for seizure disorder.
To investigate the effect of bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation on repair of glomerular podocytes and on the Nephrin expression in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) -induced nephrosis.
Forty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (n=15 each): a nephrosis model group that received a single intraperitoneal injection of PAN (0.15 mg/g); a BMSC transplantation group that received a single intraperitoneal injection of PAN (0.15 mg/g) followed by BMSC transfusion; a control group that received a single intraperitoneal injection of normal saline. Ten days after injection, the rats were sacrificed. The 24 hrs urinary protein content and serum albumin and cholesterol levels were measured 24 hrs before sacrifice. Changes of glomerular podocytes were observed under an electron microscope. Brdu labeled positive cells in kidneys were measured by immunohistochemical technology. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to assess the expression of mRNA and protein of Nephrin.
In the nephrosis model group, urinary protein and blood cholesterol contents increased, plasma albumin content decreased compared with those in the control group. Extensive fusion of podocyte foot processes was observed in the nephrosis model group. The BMSC transplantation group had decreased urinary protein and blood cholesterol contents and increased plasma albumin content compared with the nephrosis model group. Fusion of podocyte foot processes was also improved. Brdu labeled positive cells were seen in kidneys in the BMSC transplantation group, but not in the nephrosis model and the control groups. Nephrin mRNA and protein expression decreased significantly in the nephrosis model group compared with that in the control group. The BMSC transplantation group had increased Nephrin mRNA and protein expression compared with the nephrosis model group.
BMSCs can repair glomerular podocytes in PAN-induced nephrosis rats, and the changes of Nephrin expression may be involved in the process.
The behavioural effects of CM 30366, an aminopyridazine derivative, on dopamine-mediated neurotransmissions, have been studied in mice and rats. CM 30366 induced stereotyped behaviour and antagonized haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats, after parenteral and oral administration. In 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned mice, CM 30366 induced contralateral rotations and, when injected before 6-OHDA, protected mice against its neurotoxicity. CM 30366 also provoked contralateral rotations when injected directly into the mouse right striatum. After parenteral injection, CM 30366 slightly increased motility in mice, at least at low doses. The stereotypies and rotations (after intrastriatal injection) induced by CM 30366 were antagonized by haloperidol, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine and reserpine. The effects of CM 30366 were compared to those of direct and indirect dopamine-like drugs. Bromocriptine induced a behavioural profile, which in most aspects, was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of CM 30366. Apomorphine was found slightly more potent than CM 30366, but in contrast to the latter, apomorphine-induced stereotypies were insensitive to alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or reserpine. (+)-Amphetamine and nomifensine were less potent than CM 30366, and unlike CM 30366, induced ipsilateral rotations in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. These results indicate that CM 30366 is a potent atypical dopamine-like drug of potential therapeutic usefulness.
Antioxidation therapy is a promising strategy for treating or preventing oxidative stress-related liver diseases. The human thioredoxin (TRX) gene was inserted into an adenovirus vector (Adv-TRX), which was administered to mice. The mice were treated with 1 ml/kg CCl4 48 h after the infection. Blood samples were taken and the liver was excised 24 h after the CCl4 treatment. Serum ammonia, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were determined, and liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RT-PCR analysis showed that the introduced TRX gene was expressed only in the liver. Adv-TRX decreased the serum ammonia, AST, and ALT levels. Hematoxylin-eosin staining indicated that the CCl4-induced injury was significantly prevented by the Adv-TRX infection. The gene delivery of TRX, which plays a central role in intracellular redox control, was shown to be effective in protecting the liver against oxidative stress-induced injury.
Damage to bone tissue due to heat shock is one of the main causes of the failure of osseointegration at the bone-implant interface. To investigate the effect of heat shock on regeneration of bone tissue, osteoblasts were exposed to heat shock for 10 minutes at 42, 45, or 48 degrees C or kept at 37 degrees C as a control. After 10 minutes of heat shock, disruption of actin filaments was seen in the cells and the degree of disruption increased with the temperature. The cytoskeleton reassembled after a 12-hour incubation at 37 degrees C in the cells treated at 42 or 45 degrees C, but this reversible recovery did not occur in the cells treated at 48 degrees C. Flow cytometric analysis showed that heat shock at 48 degrees C increased the number of necrotic cells to 15-20% within minutes (p < 0.05 compared with 37 degrees C). Apoptosis, evidenced by annexin V staining, DNA laddering, and caspase 3 activation, started after 6-8 hours of incubation, reached a peak at 12 hours, and gradually declined (p<0.05). Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine reduced the necrosis induced at 48 degrees C of heat shock by one-half (p<0.05) but had no significant effect on caspase 3 activation induced by heat shock, suggesting that reactive oxygen species were critical in heat shock-induced necrosis but not in apoptosis. Heat shock at 48 degrees C induced a sustained translocation of p53 into the nucleus and a sustained activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase, whereas that at 42 and 45 degrees C induced only transient p53 translocation and c-jun N-terminal kinase activation. These results suggest that the sustained activation of p53 and c-jun N-terminal kinase pathways may contribute to heat shock-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, heat shock protein 70 increased dramatically in the cells treated at 45 or 48 degrees C, suggesting that the protecting mechanism in the cells was also activated. Such protection was able to prevent apoptosis in cells treated at 45 degrees C but not in those treated at 48 degrees C.
Our recent study indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism may involve in genetic control of blood pressure response to treatment by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor. Currently, we proposed to further investigate whether short-term blood pressure response to benazepril, was modulated by haplotypes re-constructed from both C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in MTHFR gene. A total of 410 hypertensive patients recruited from 344 nuclear families were treated orally with benazepril at a daily dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at baseline and on the 16th day of treatment. In addition, 689 family members of these patients were also genotyped. Among these patients, the frequency of MTHFR A1298C AA, AC and CC genotypes was 74.4%, 23.9%, and 1.7%, respectively. The frequency of MTHFR C677T CC, CT and TT genotypes was 23.7%, 51.2%, and 25.1%, respectively. Only three haplotypes, 677T-1298A (50.8%), 677C-1298A (35.7%), and 677C-1298C (13.5%) were re-constructed. Multivariate regression models with generalized estimating equation (GEE) correction detected that the individuals carrying one copy of haplotype 677C-1298C had significantly lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP and DeltaSBP) to benazepril treatment (p= 0.003 and p =0.043, respectively), in comparison to those without haplotype 677C-1298C. The results of family-based association test further confirmed that haplotype 677C-1298C was more frequently transmitted in subjects with either lower residual of DeltaDBP or DeltaSBP. For residual of DeltaDBP, the p-values are 0.007 in an additive model and 0.005 in a dominant model. For residual of DeltaSBP, the p-values are 0.009 in an additive model and 0.006 in a dominant model. Our findings suggest that MTHFR 677C-1298C haplotype modulate blood pressure responsiveness to shortterm treatment of ACE inhibitor in Chinese essential hypertensive patients.
We report a case of salicylism caused by association of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and acetazolamide. A 50-year-old woman without chronic renal insufficiency, was admitted for confusion, cerebellar ataxia associated with hyperchloremic acidosis. She was treated with acetazolamide for simple glaucoma and since 14 days with ASA for acute pericarditis. Clinical features evoked salicylism despite low serum salicylate level: 178 mg/l. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor explained the biochemical pattern. Acetazolamide-induced acidosis enhances the non ionized form of salicylate which crosses the biological membrane more rapidly and better than the ionized form. The tissular tropism of non ionized salicylate increases and cerebral toxicity may occur with low serum level of ASA. ASA also enhances the free form of acetazolamide.
New formulations of extrafine particles of long-acting beta-2 agonists plus inhaled corticosteroids (LABA + ICS) have been shown to reach peripheral regions of the lung. The aim of the study was to assess the effect on small airway obstruction of long-term treatments with two different LABA + ICS formulations in asthma. Ten subjects with moderate persistent asthma were enrolled. After a 4-week washout period they were treated in a randomized crossover design for 24 weeks with formoterol, 12 micrograms, and beclomethasone, 200 micrograms, hydrofluoroalkane (HFA; by metered-dose inhaler) b.i.d. (FB) or salmeterol, 50 micrograms, and fluticasone, 250 micrograms (by dry-powder inhaler), b.i.d. (SF). At baseline and at the end of each period subjects underwent an Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Pulmonary Function Testing. The N(2) phase III slope and closing volume (CV) during single-breath washout test and difference between the maximal expiratory flow rates with air and heliox at isovolume corresponding to 50% [Delta(heliox-air)MEF(50%)] were measured to assess changes on peripheral airways function. Two subjects dropped out and eight completed the study. After SF and FB, forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV(1); p < 0.01) and FEV(1)/forced vital capacity (FVC; p < 0.01 for SF and p < 0.05 for FB) increased when compared with baseline. Although both FB and SF treatments slightly increased delta(heliox-air)MEF(50% isovolume) versus baseline, only after FB the N(2) phase III slope and CV decreased from 1.61 ± 0.61%/L to 1.35 ± 0.49 N(2)%/L (p = 0.054) and from 0.98 ± 0.56 L to 0.88 ± 0.58 L (p < 0.05), respectively. ACT score raised from 19 ± 5 (baseline) to 23 ± 1 after FB (p < 0.02) and 23 ± 2 after SF (p < 0.05). When compared with baseline and in contrast to SF (50/250 micrograms b.i.d.), FB HFA (12/200 micrograms b.i.d.) significantly improved functional parameters reflecting small airway obstruction in asthmatic patients. Registered in the public trial registry at www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01255579.
Since 1965, Health and Welfare Canada has operated an adverse drug reaction (ADR) program. The program accepts spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions, and maintains an ADR database. The purpose of this article is to summarize the Psychiatric ADRs reported to this database since 1965. The nature of the information prohibits its use in the evaluation of epidemiological hypotheses about the etiology of drug-induced mental disorders. However, in an exploratory sense, the contents of the database may contribute to the development of epidemiological hypotheses about the etiology of drug-induced mental disorders. Of particular interest are areas of apparent contradiction between the contents of the database and the clinical literature.
The database was searched for reports of ADRs to a group of drugs which have been frequently implicated in causing psychiatric toxicity. All reports characterized as "psychiatric disorders" were down-loaded from the database for the analysis (n = 1822). The reports were further classified into nine categories according to the type of psychiatric symptoms described.
There were several reports of hallucinations caused by methyldopa, and also several reports of benzodiazepine-induced hallucinations and encephalopathy. These reactions have not been described in the literature. Also, there were few reports of digoxin-induced organic depression, and an absence of reports of organic mania induced by H-2 blockers, despite descriptions of these sorts of reactions in the clinical literature.
Further research is needed to define the neuropsychiatric toxicity associated with medical drugs. Clinicians must continue to consider the potential role of medications in the etiology of psychiatric symptoms.
The aim of this study was to compare the effects on fibrinogenolysis and thrombin generation of two recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimens in patients with pulmonary embolism entering a randomised, controlled study with a 1:2 allocation ratio to rt-PA, 100 mg over 2 h (Group A) or rt-PA, 0.6 mg/kg, maximum dose 50 mg, over 15 min (Group B). In both groups the heparin infusion was stopped 2-4 h before starting thrombolytic treatment and resumed accordingly to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or thrombin clotting time (TcT). Seventeen patients in Group A and 30 patients in Group B were evaluated before starting thrombolytic treatment and 2, 6 and 24 h after its end for the following parameters: aPTT, TcT, fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), plasmin-alpha 2 antiplasmin (PAP) and thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complexes. The two groups had similar coagulation parameters at baseline. Two h after starting rt-PA, the aPTT was more prolonged in Group A than in Group B patients (P = 0.01). Patients in Group B showed less reduction in plasma fibrinogen levels at all study times after rt-PA treatment (P = 0.008). The increase in plasma FDP (P = 0.037) and PAP (P = 0.001) levels was lower at 2 and 6 h samples in Group B compared with Group A. TcT was prolonged (P = 0.003) and TAT increased (P = 0.001) during treatment without differences between the two groups. AUC0-24 of fibrinogen, FDP and PAP levels confirmed the statistically significant differences (P = 0.04) between the two groups over the entire 24 h period of the study. Three patients in Group A (17.6%) and three (10.0%) in Group B suffered major or other important bleeding. Our results indicate that the administration of weight-adjusted reduced-dose rt-PA bolus produces less impairment of blood coagulation than the FDA approved regimen.
Although epidemiologic data strongly suggest a role for inhaled environmental pollutants in modulating the susceptibility to respiratory infection in humans, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been well studied in experimental systems. The current study assessed the impact of inhaled diesel engine emissions (DEE) on the host response in vivo to a common pediatric respiratory pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Using a relatively resistant mouse model of RSV infection, prior exposure to either 30 microg/m3 particulate matter (PM) or 1,000 microg/m3 PM of inhaled DEE (6 h/d for seven consecutive days) increased lung inflammation to RSV infection as compared with air-exposed RSV-infected C57Bl/6 mice. Inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were increased in a dose-dependent manner with regard to the level of DEE exposure, concomitant with increased levels of inflammatory mediators. Lung histology analysis indicated pronounced peribronchial and peribronchiolar inflammation concordant with the level of DEE exposure during infection. Mucous cell metaplasia was markedly increased in the airway epithelium of DEE-exposed mice following RSV infection. Interestingly, both airway and alveolar host defense and immunomodulatory proteins were attenuated during RSV infection by prior DEE exposure. DEE-induced changes in inflammatory and lung epithelial responses to infection were associated with increased RSV gene expression in the lungs following DEE exposure. These findings are consistent with the concept that DEE exposure modulates the lung host defense to respiratory viral infections and may alter the susceptibility to respiratory infections leading to increased lung disease.
Chlorpromazine, a commonly used antipsychotic drug, has been known to induce QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, which can cause sudden death. We studied the effects of chlorpromazine on the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes and on delayed rectifier K current of guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Application of chlorpromazine showed a dose-dependent decrease in the amplitudes of steady-state currents and tail currents of HERG. The decrease became more pronounced at increasingly positive potential, suggesting that the blockade of HERG by chlorpromazine is voltage dependent. IC50 for chlorpromazine block of HERG current was progressively decreased according to depolarization: IC50 values at -30, 0, and +30 mV were 10.5, 8.8, and 4.9 microM, respectively. The block of HERG current during the voltage step increased with time starting from a level 89% of the control current. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, bath application of 2 and 5 microM chlorpromazine at 36 degree C blocked rapidly activating delayed rectifier K current (IKr) by 31 and 83%, respectively. How-ever, the same concentrations of chlorpromazine failed to significantly block slowly activating delayed rectifier K current (IKs). Our findings suggest that the arrhythmogenic side effect of chlorpromazine is caused by blockade of HERG and rapid component of delayed rectifier K current rather than by blockade of the slow component.
Data from four double-blind studies of the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis were combined. For 4 to 12 weeks, 747 patients received Arthrotec, a combination of 50 mg of diclofenac and 200 micrograms of misoprostol, and 754 patients received 50 mg of diclofenac; the drugs were given twice or three times daily. The five most commonly reported adverse events were abdominal pain by 23.2% of the diclofenac/misoprostol patients and 19.8% of the diclofenac patients; diarrhea by 19.9% and 11.3%; nausea by 11.8% and 6.5%; dyspepsia by 11.2% and 7.8%; and flatulence by 8.0% and 3.1%. Other adverse events, reported by similar proportions of both treatment groups, included headache, gastritis, dizziness, vomiting, and constipation. In the diclofenac/misoprostol-treated patients, the abdominal pain and diarrhea were rated mild in 30.6% and 24.3%, moderate in 49.1% and 51.4%, and severe in 20.2% and 24.3%. Serious adverse events occurred in eight of the diclofenac/misoprostol-treated patients and in 13 of the diclofenac-treated patients; 12.6% and 10.1%, respectively, were withdrawn from the study because of adverse events. Results of laboratory tests of hepatic and renal function were similar in the two treatment groups.
To describe the methodology used to induce ovulation in a 41-year-old woman with imminent ovarian failure and tubal factor so that in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) could be performed.
Ethinyl estradiol was used to suppress elevated serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, thus theoretically allowing restoration of down-regulated FSH receptors and response to endogenous gonadotropins.
One oocyte was retrieved and fertilized and one embryo was transferred. The patient conceived and is presently in her last trimester.
Successful pregnancy following IVF-ET is possible in women with imminent ovarian failure - even in women older than age 40.
Pregnant rats were fed either a control (20% protein) or low (3.5%) protein diet during gestation and lactation. The pups were separated from their mothers on postnatal day 21, and were given the same diet as their corresponding mothers. The groups of pups from each diet group were treated on either postnatal day 21 or postnatal day 60 with 7.5 mg methylmercury chloride (MeHgCl) per kg b.w. once daily by gavage for 10 consecutive days, and the development of ataxia (hind-limb crossing) was monitored. The offspring from mothers on the protein-deficient diet were found to be more sensitive to MeHg-induced ataxia than those on the protein-sufficient diet. The former accumulated more mercury in different brain regions than the latter. The rates of protein synthesis in different brain regions of the offspring fed the protein-deficient diet were significantly reduced compared with the rates in those fed the protein-sufficient diet. However, MeHg treatment did not significantly modify the rates of such protein synthesis further in protein-deficient rats. Thus, a significantly much higher inhibition of the intrinsic rates of protein synthesis in different brain regions due to severe protein deficiency, as observed in this study, may be partly responsible for the increased susceptibility of developing rats fed a protein-deficient diet to MeHg-induced ataxia, or hindlimb crossing, although other factor(s) might also be involved.
Alpidem is a new anxiolytic of imidazopyridine structure which has a high affinity for the omega 1 (BZ1) modulatory site of the GABAA receptor. The present study investigated whether tolerance and physical dependence develop after repeated treatment with alpidem, as is observed with benzodiazepines. Mice were given alpidem (100 mg/kg, p.o.) or diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) twice daily for 10 consecutive days. Tolerance was assessed by measuring antagonism of pentylenetetrazole- and isoniazid-induced convulsions and bicuculline-provoked mortality, following repeated drug treatment. Decreases in the latency to isoniazid-induced convulsions and in the minimal convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole were taken as an index of physical dependence and were evaluated at different times (3, 6, 14, 42, 67, 96 hr) after drug withdrawal or after flumazenil administration. In addition, changes in sensitivity to the convulsant effect of a beta-carboline (beta-CCM) were measured. Repeated treatment with diazepam produced tolerance to its anticonvulsant activities as indicated by shifts of the dose-response curves by a factor of 3-5. After discontinuation of diazepam treatment, spontaneous withdrawal occurred within 24 hr and lasted 67 hr as indicated by decreases in the threshold for convulsions induced by isoniazid and pentylenetetrazole. Flumazenil-induced withdrawal was observed in both isoniazid and pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion models. Hypersensitivity of mice to the convulsant effect of beta-CCM also occurred. In contrast, repeated treatment with alpidem did not produce tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects and neither spontaneous nor flumazenil-induced withdrawal was observed in the pentylenetetrazole and isoniazid models. Moreover, withdrawal of alpidem did not induce any change in the convulsant activity of beta-CCM. These differences between alpidem and diazepam may be related to the low level of receptor occupancy during repeated treatment with alpidem because of its selectivity for omega 1 (BZ1) sites and to its moderate intrinsic activity.
To assess efficiency and safety of high-dose beklometasone dipropionate in patients with bronchial asthma (BA).
The trial included 14 female and 3 male patients with moderate or severe BA (mean age 43.6 years) in declining exacerbation. The patients inhaled beklometasone dipropionate as a dose-adjusted aerosol with built-up spacer (beklojet) in a daily dose 1000-2000 mcg for 8 weeks. Changes in clinical symptoms, life quality (AQLQ) and bronchial permeability (peak flowmetry, FEV1) were registered. Concentration of H2O2 in expired air condensate was measured spectrophotometrically to evaluate activity of airway inflammation. Oral smears were studied mycologically, hydrocortisone in blood plasma was measured with enzyme immunoassay.
The treatment produced positive trend in clinical symptoms and quality of life. Bronchial permeability improved since the 7th treatment day. H2O2 significantly fell, hydrocortisone levels and fungal flora did not change significantly.
Beklometasone dipropionate in high doses for 8 weeks is effective and safe against BA.
Computed tomography studies demonstrate thickening of the asthmatic airway wall and its relation to disease severity. We evaluated the effect of inhaled corticosteroid on this phenomenon.
Cross-sectional images of the right upper lobe apical segmental bronchus were obtained by helical computed tomography in 45 corticosteroid-naïve patients with persistent asthma and 28 healthy controls. Airway wall thickness was measured as airway wall area normalized to body surface area. Computed tomography, pulmonary function, and serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein were examined before and after treatment with beclomethasone (800 microg/d for 12 weeks).
Before treatment, airway wall thickness was greater in asthma patients than in controls (P <0.0001). After treatment, it decreased by 11% (P <0.001) but remained high (P <0.0001 vs. control); the serum level of eosinophil cationic protein decreased, and airflow obstruction was reduced, but not to the level in controls. The decrease in wall thickness was associated with a decrease in the serum level of eosinophil cationic protein (r = 0.39, P = 0.009) and an increase in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (r = 0.45, P = 0.003) and was inversely related to disease duration at entry (r = -0.38, P = 0.009). Post-treatment wall thickness was related to disease duration (r = 0.45, P = 0.003) and remaining airflow obstruction.
Wall thickening of asthmatic central airways responds partially to inhaled corticosteroid therapy and may reflect an overall reduction in airway inflammation. "Unresponsive components," possibly involving structural changes, may increase in the absence of inhaled corticosteroid treatment, potentially leading to chronic airflow obstruction.
Oxidative stress has an important role in the pathogenesis of doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of erdosteine, an antioxidant agent, on doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity.
Rats were divided into control, doxorubicin alone (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and doxorubicin plus erdosteine (50 mg/kg/day, oral) groups. At the end of the 10(th) day, liver tissues were removed for light microscopy and analysis. The levels of tissue protein carbonyl content, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, were determined.
The tissue of the doxorubicin group showed some histopathological changes such as necrosis, hepatocyte degeneration, sinusoidal dilatation, hemorrhage and vascular congestion and dilatation. In the doxorubicin plus erdosteine group, histopathological evidence of hepatic damage was markedly reduced. Biochemical parameters were consistent with histological parameters.
Doxorubicin caused hepatotoxicity, and erdosteine treatment prevented lipid peroxidation and protein oxidant in liver tissue.
Allergy to tartrazine-containing psychotropic medication (especially antidepressants) had been reported. 20 patients of apparent allergy to tartrazine-containing alprazolam brands in 480 patients exposed to the dye are described. Rechallenge with non tartrazine-containing alprazolam brands did not produce the similar allergic reactions.
To investigate whether the 1998 government policy for mandatory fortification of flour and pasta products with folate was followed by a reduction in the prevalence of severe congenital heart defects.
Time trend analysis.
Province of Quebec, Canada.
Infants born in 1990-2005 identified with severe congenital heart defects (tetralogy of Fallot, endocardial cushion defects, univentricular hearts, truncus arteriosus, or transposition complexes) in Quebec administrative databases.
Data analysed in two time periods (before and after fortification). Birth prevalence measured annually as infants (live and stillbirths) with severe congenital heart defects per 1000 births in Quebec. Changes in the birth prevalence from the period before to the period after fortification were estimated with Poisson regression.
Among the 1, 324,440 births in Quebec in 1990-2005 there were 2083 infants born with severe congenital heart defects, corresponding to an average birth prevalence of 1.57/1000 births. Time trend analysis showed no change in the birth prevalence of severe birth defects in the nine years before fortification (rate ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.03), while in the seven years after fortification there was a significant 6% decrease per year (0.94, 0.90 to 0.97).
Public health measures to increase folic acid intake were followed by a decrease in the birth prevalence of severe congenital heart defects. These findings support the hypothesis that folic acid has a preventive effect on heart defects.
