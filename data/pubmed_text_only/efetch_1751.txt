A 55-year-old man with idiopathic Parkinson's disease developed myasthenia gravis shortly after taking trihexyphenidyl. The myasthenic weakness waxed and waned with rise and fall in serum levels of trihexyphenidyl, without marked change of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titer.
A 70-year-old woman with recurrent angina at rest and dyspnea was admitted for coronary angiography. Prior to the admission an ECG showed new negative T-waves in the precordial leads, which have completely disappeared the day after. Clinical examination revealed a low systolic murmur over the aortic valve and a low murmur over the left groin artery. The other examination findings were normal.
Exercise ECG revealed no signs of ischemia. In the coronary angiography a plaque in the left circumflex artery without significant lumen reduction could be detected. Intracoronary administration of acetylcholine induced a spasm in the left circumflex artery with total lumen occlusion with reproduction of intense chest pain. After injection of nitroglycerin coronary spasm and chest pain were reversible
After the diagnosis of vasospastic angina pectoris medical treatment with isosorbide dinitrate and amlodipine was initiated. Additionally ACE- and CSE-inhibitors were prescribed to improve endothelial dysfunction. After one year the patient was free of symptoms.
Coronary spasm can cause angina at rest. After confirmation of diagnosis an appropriate medical therapy could be applied and other unnecessary examinations including further coronary angiographies could be prevented.
The authors report the case of a 28 year old woman who developed antero-septoapical myocardial infarction in the post-partum period. This was detected by surface ECG and echocardiography performed after a systemic embolism. The infarction followed treatment with Parlodel for inhibition of lactation. Coronary angiography, performed one month post-partum, was normal and the methergin test was negative. The physiopathological mechanism of myocardial infarction resulted from the association of an iatrogenic spastic phenomenon favourised by the patient restarting to smoke and the physiological arterial hyperactivity of the post-partum period. This mechanism raises the question of preventive measures in cases of inhibition of lactation in the post-partum period, notably stopping smoking.
Three patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the nephrotic syndrome had atypical membranous glomerulonephritis or lobular membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with subepithelial and subendothelial deposits containing IgG1 kappa, IgG1 lambda or IgM and IgG by immunofluorescence, respectively. A monoclonal cryoglobulin was intermittently found in the serum in one case. In two patients, kidney deposits were made of organized microtubular structures. Intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin inclusions in the two patients' lymphocytes showed a very similar electron microscopic pattern. The immunologic phenotype of leukemic lymphocytes was analogous in the three cases (with expression of CD2) and suggestive of a late maturation step. A complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome was observed after therapy with chlorambucil (and prednisone). These observations suggest a direct role of monoclonal immunoglobulins in kidney disease.
Clonidine is approved in the US for epidural administration in the treatment of intractable neuropathic cancer pain, but is also administered intrathecally for this indication and both epidurally and intrathecally in the treatment of acute, postoperative pain. The purpose of the current study was to estimate the relative potency of clonidine by epidural and intrathecal routes in the treatment of capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia as a model of central hypersensitivity and of noxious heat as a model of acute pain. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either intrathecal clonidine (75, 150, or 300 micrograms) or epidural clonidine (150, 300, or 600 micrograms) and rated pain from a Peltier-controlled thermode at a lumbar, thoracic, and cervical dermatomal site before and after drug administration. In addition, they rated pain from intradermal capsaicin injections at a lumbar dermatome before and 60 min after clonidine injection and described areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia to mechanical stimuli. Clonidine's effect differed with route of administration and modality of sensory testing. For acute thermal pain, intrathecal clonidine produced a dose-dependent analgesia with a lumbar>thoracic>cervical gradient, whereas only one dose of epidural clonidine reduced thermal pain and this was at the thoracic testing site. In contrast, the potency of clonidine to reduce capsaicin-induced allodynia was similar between the two routes of injection, and for hyperalgesia, clonidine was only slightly more potent after intrathecal than epidural injection. These data support clinical studies from non-comparative trials and suggest there is a >6-fold potency ratio of intrathecal:epidural administration of clonidine for acute pain, but a <2-fold potency ratio for these routes for mechanical hypersensitivity.
HLA genotype and anti-inflammatory drug use have independently been associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently reported a negative association between aspirin use and AD. To investigate this further, we performed a cross-sectional study to investigate cognitive performance in 151 non-demented individuals in relation to HLA-DRB1 genotype and aspirin use. Aspirin and HLA-DRB1*01 were positive predictors of performance on logical memory (aspirin, p=0.04) and verbal fluency tests (HLA-DRB1*01, p=0.018), respectively. HLA-DRB1*05 had a negative impact on the Boston naming test (p=0.002). Our results suggest that aspirin use and inflammatory genotype may influence cognition in non-demented subjects.
We describe a 6-year-old girl presenting with nail dysplasia affecting all nails and hands for 2 years. Changes were seen on the ulnar side of the nails. She was assessed for limitation of elbow movements at 3 weeks of age and underwent physiotherapy for thickened biceps tendon. She subsequently developed laxity of knees and ankles, and x-ray revealed absent patellae at 32 weeks. She had behavioral abnormalities and sleep disturbances. X-ray of the pelvis revealed iliac horns, and urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria. She had mixed hyperlipidemia. Her chromosomal analysis was normal but showed a mutation in the LMX1B gene. She was diagnosed to have Nail-patella syndrome or Hereditary osteo-onychodysplasia (HOOD Syndrome). Her renal imaging was normal, as were her ocular pressures. She is under regular surveillance by a multi-disciplinary team of genetic counselors, orthopedists, rheumatologists and ophthalmologists. She is currently prescribed enalapril, melatonin and simvastatin.
We tested the ability of magnesium sulfate to reduce hypertension and neonatal growth retardation in an animal model of preeclampsia.
On day 17 of pregnancy, osmotic minipumps were inserted subcutaneously to continuously deliver either vehicle (saline control group), or N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (50 mg/kg/day), or L-NAME (50 mg/kg/day) in combination with magnesium sulfate (60 mg/kg/day). Prior to insertion, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored with a pneumatic tail cuff device. Blood pressure measurements were repeated on days 18, 20, and 21 of pregnancy. Blood was obtained on days 17 and 21, along with urine, to assess magnesium levels and degree of proteinuria. Pups were weighed and measured at 48 hours postpartum.
Rats receiving L-NAME developed hypertension within 24 hours of implantation (108 +/- 3.9 vs. 123 +/- 3.4 mmHg, p < 0.05). Magnesium sulfate, given along with L-NAME did not prevent mean blood pressure from increasing, but reduced it by day 21 compared to L-NAME given alone (107 +/- 3.4 vs. 122 +/- 8.7 mmHg, respectively, p < 0.05). Magnesium sulfate reduced neonatal growth retardation by improving the weight of the pups compared to pups from maternal rats given L-NAME alone (6.1 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.2 +/- 0.3 grams, respectively, p < 0.05).
Maternal magnesium sulfate reduces blood pressure and increases neonatal size compared to L-NAME without magnesium. These findings support a beneficial effect of magnesium in preeclampsia.
Methotrexate (MTX)-associated myelopathy is a rare but serious subacute complication of MTX-based chemotherapy. We report the case of a woman with breast cancer and meningeal carcinomatosis who developed severe progressive myelopathy after four cycles of intrathecal MTX administration. We substituted high doses of the key metabolites of the methyl-transfer pathway: S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), 200 mg three times daily i.v.; folinate, 20 mg four times daily i.v.; cyanocobalamin, 100 microg once daily i.v.; and methionine, 5 g daily p.o. The patient's paraparesis improved rapidly thereafter, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed resolution of the intramedullary lesions. Genetic analyses revealed homozygosity for the A allele of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.1298A>C (p.E429A), whereas other genetic variants of folate/methionine metabolism associated with MTX neurotoxicity were not present. Substitution with multiple folate metabolites may be a promising strategy for the treatment of MTX-induced neurotoxicity.
N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) is an alkylating agent having antiproliferative cytotoxity targeting the neural stem/progenitor cells to cause microcephaly by maternal exposure. This study investigated the effect of transient exposure to MNU on the process of hippocampal neurogenesis in later life using mice. Pregnant mice received a single injection of MNU at 0, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally on gestational day 14, and their offspring were examined on postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND 77. On PND 21, offspring displayed microcephaly and hippocampal formation hypoplasia at 10 mg/kg, decrease of doublecortin (Dcx)(+) cells in the dentate subgranular zone from 5mg/kg, and decrease of TUNEL(+) apoptotic cells and increase of transcript expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 at 10 mg/kg in the dentate gyrus. In the dentate hilus, numbers of reelin(+) or parvalbumin (Pvalb)(+) interneurons or neuron-specific nuclear protein(+) neurons increased at 10 mg/kg. Microcephaly and hippocampal formation hypoplasia continued through PND 77 at 10 mg/kg. Thus, apart from the massive cell killing at the migratory stream causing microcephaly, MNU may decrease Dcx(+) cells reflecting disruption of the differentiation process of late-stage neuronal progenitors and immature granule cells through defective molecular functions by gene mutations. Increase of reelin(+) and Pvalb(+) cells may reflect the disruption of neurogenesis and following neuronal migration. All of the granule cell lineage and interneuron changes disappeared at the adult stage on PND 77 suggesting that MNU mainly targets transient populations of highly proliferative progenitor cells but hardly affects their stem cells having self-renewal ability.
To review reports on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) during pregnancy in order to determine the incidence, nature, and potential mechanisms of fetal complications in an attempt to establish recommendations related to the use of these drugs during gestation.
Relevant English-language articles identified through a Medline search and bibliographies found in recent articles.
Large number of reports both on animals and on humans have consistently shown a high degree of morbidity and even mortality in fetuses or newborns exposed to ACE-I during pregnancy. The reported complications include oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, premature labor, fetal and neonatal renal failure, bony malformations, limb contractures, persistent patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypoplasia, respiratory distress syndrome, prolonged hypotension, and neonatal death. A high incidence of fetal complications was related to the use of ACE-I at all trimesters of pregnancy.
The gestational use of ACE-I may be associated with a high degree of fetal and newborn morbidity and even mortality. The use of these drugs should be avoided at all trimesters of pregnancy.
Evidence suggests that fibromyalgia is related to both chronic sympathetic hyperactivity and decreased levels of serotonin.
To examine the efficacy of pindolol, a mixed serotonin (5-HT)(1A) presynaptic autoreceptor/beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, in the treatment of fibromyalgia.
An open trial was conducted using 20 female patients who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia. Treatment was initiated with pindolol 7.5 mg/day and titrated to a maximum dose of 15 mg/day for a total of 90 days. Primary outcome measures were tender point analysis and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Anxiety and depression were measured with the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales and Beck Depression Inventory.
There was significant improvement in primary outcome measures, including Tender Point Count (mean +/- SD, 16.3 +/- 2.2 vs 12.3 +/- 5.0; F = 8.9; p < 0.001), Tender Point Score (24.4 +/- 5.7 vs 17.5 +/- 9.4; F = 7.8; p < 0.001), and FIQ (45.3 +/- 10.8 vs 35.0 +/- 15.0; F = 5.6; p < 0.005). The depression and anxiety scores did not change significantly among women who completed the study, while the impact on cardiovascular parameters was clinically insignificant.
While the current results are encouraging, further studies are needed to determine whether pindolol might be effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Limitations of this study include small group size and lack of placebo control.
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) carries a markedly increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to the normal range may prevent premature atherosclerosis and usually requires a combination of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The major objective of this study is to compare two different drug combinations for the treatment of heterozygous FH.
The current investigation is a short-term, double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of fluvastatin when combined with cholestyramine (group 1) or with bezafibrate (group 2) in 38 patients with heterozygous FH.
After 6 weeks of combination treatment, in comparison to a drug-free baseline (patients receiving single-blind placebo during the lead-in period of an earlier study, ie, before ever receiving fluvastatin), the combination of 40 mg/d of fluvastatin with 400 mg/d of bezafibrate in group 2 reduced plasma LDL-C levels by 35% as compared with 32% in group 1, and reduced the LDL-C/high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio by 46%, compared to 37% in group 1 (a non-significant difference for both comparisons). When compared to an intermittent 6-week open-label administration of 40 mg fluvastatin monotherapy, the addition of cholestyramine or bezafibrate each reduced LDL-C by an additional 13% (P < 0.01 for both regimens).
Fluvastatin-bezafibrate is superior to a fluvastatin-cholestyramine combination for lowering serum triglycerides and elevating HDL-C serum levels in patients in conjunction with a significant lowering of LDL-C/HDL-C ratios, and may be an effective synergistic therapy for heterozygous FH. No episodes of myositis were seen in this short-term study, a finding that is in agreement with most of the reported studies on statin-fibrate combinations reviewed here.
Pyrazinamide is one of the first line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Hepatotoxicity and hyperuricaemia are important and common untoward effects seen after administration of pyrazinamide. The drug inhibits elimination of urates resulting in hyperuricaemia, the presenting features of which are arthralgia, arthritis or even gout. A-case of bilateral leg cramps due to hyperuricaemia following pyrazinamide therapy is reported here.
Cisplatin-based adjuvant treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has become standard, thanks to the studies that have shown a significant survival advantage. The identification of patients who could benefit from this adjuvant treatment would allow ineffective and toxic administrations to be avoided. Immunohistochemical expression of the excision repair cross-complementation group (ERCC)-1 protein has been associated with response to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC, and some polymorphisms of the genes involved in DNA repair have been shown to be associated with survival in advanced NSCLC.
The aim of our study was to evaluate the progression-free survival and tolerability of adjuvant treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC, according to common DNA repair gene polymorphisms and ERCC1 expression.
We investigated the association of three DNA repair gene polymorphisms - Asn118Asn in ERCC1 (rs11615), Lys751Gln in ERCC2 (rs13181), and Asp1104His in ERCC5 (rs17655) - with the progression-free survival of 85 patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy after surgery for NSCLC.
We did not find significant associations between any of these polymorphisms and progression-free survival, nor did we observe any difference in progression-free survival according to ERCC1 expression.
The previously reported impact of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on platinum-based chemotherapy treatment of advanced NSCLC was not observed in our study in the adjuvant setting.
The authors report on a polyradiculoneuropathy related to long-term treatment with Perhexiline maleate (a drug used in France since 1973 for coronary insufficiency) whose presenting sign is a bilateral aedematous optic neuropathy. The mechanism of this effect on the optic nerves and on papilloedema is discussed; it seems not to be caused by a direct toxic action on the optic fibres but by the existence of chronic intracranial hypertension.
We evaluated the influence of psychotherapy attendance on treatment outcome in 90 dually (cocaine and heroin) dependent outpatients who completed 70 days of a controlled clinical trial of sublingual buprenorphine (16 mg, 8 mg, or 2 mg daily, or 16 mg every other day) plus weekly individual standardized interpersonal cognitive psychotherapy. Treatment outcome was evaluated by quantitative urine benzoylecgonine (BZE) and morphine levels (log-transformed), performed three times per week. Repeated-measures linear regression was used to assess the effects of psychotherapy attendance (percent of visits kept), medication group, and study week on urine drug metabolite levels. Mean psychotherapy attendance was 71% of scheduled visits. Higher psychotherapy attendance was associated with lower urine BZE levels, and this association grew more pronounced as the study progressed (p=0.04). The inverse relationship between psychotherapy attendance and urine morphine levels varied by medication group, being most pronounced for subjects receiving 16 mg every other day (p=0.02). These results suggest that psychotherapy can improve the outcome of buprenorphine maintenance treatment for patients with dual (cocaine and opioid) dependence.
Bilateral sciatic nerve paralysis developed in two patients with invasive bladder cancer following intraarterial infusion of cisplatin (CDDP) and 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (THP) as preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Balloon catheters were selectively inserted into both internal iliac arteries, and CDDP 100 mg/m2 and THP 40 mg/m2 were administered under balloon occlusion. Pain of lower extremities developed soon after infusion and was gradually followed by paralysis. One patient recovered from paralysis partially after 4 months, but the other patient didn't recover. The use of balloon catheters resulted in an excessive concentration of chemotherapeutic agents with the adverse action on the sciatic nerves.
In mammals, abnormal increases in fetal androgens disrupt normal development of the female phenotype. Due to the recent concern regarding environmental androgen-active chemicals, there is a need to identify sources of fetal androgen variation and sensitive developmental markers for androgenic activity in female rats. Anogenital distances (AGD), nipple retention, reproductive tract, and external genitalia are morphological parameters organized by prenatal androgens and are predictive of altered masculinized/defeminized phenotype in adult female mice and rats. The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the natural prenatal androgen environment of rats including the magnitude of the intrauterine position (IUP) effect, (2) characterize the permanent effects of prenatal androgen exposure on female rats, and (3) determine the ability of AGD and areolas to predict these permanent androgenic alterations in female rats. Untreated male fetal rats had higher tissue testosterone (T) concentrations than females in the amniotic fluid, reproductive tract, gonad, and fetal body. The intrauterine position (IUP) of male and female fetuses did not affect T concentrations or AGD in male or female rats at gestational day (GD) 22. Female offspring exposed to 0, 1.5, and 2.5 mg/kg/day testosterone propionate (TP) on GDs 14-18 displayed increased AGD at postnatal day (PND) 2 and decreased nipples at PND 13 and as adults. TP-induced changes in neonatal AGD and infant areola number were reliable indicators of permanently altered adult phenotype in female rats. Further, females in the two high-dose groups displayed increased incidences of external genital malformations and the presence of prostatic tissue, not normally found in female rats.
The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is a large complex of membrane-associated proteins linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in muscle. Transmembrane heterodimeric (alphabeta) integrins serve also as cellular adhesion molecules and mechanotransducers. In the animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the mdx mouse, loss of dystrophin causes more severe abnormalities in skeletal than in cardiac muscle. We hypothesized that ablation of cardiac myocyte integrins in the mdx background would lead to a severe cardiomyopathic phenotype. Mdx mice were crossed to ones with cardiac myocyte-specific deletion of beta1 integrin (beta1KO) to generate beta1KOmdx. Unstressed beta1KOmdx mice were viable and had normal cardiac function; however, high mortality was seen in peri- and postpartum females by 6 months of age, when severe myocardial necrosis and fibrosis and extensive dystrophic calcification was seen. Decreased ventricular function and blunted adrenergic responsiveness was found in the beta1KOmdx mice compared with control (Lox/Lox, no Cre), beta1KO, and mdx. Similarly, adult beta1KOmdx males were more prone to isoproterenol-induced heart failure and death compared with control groups. Given the extensive calcification, we analyzed transcript levels of genes linked to fibrosis and calcification and found matrix gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein, decorin, periostin, and the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2/Cbfa1 significantly increased in beta1KOmdx cardiac muscle. Our data show that combined deficiency of dystrophin and integrins in murine cardiac myocytes results in more severe cardiomyopathic changes in the stressed myocardium than reduction of either dystrophin or integrins alone and predisposes to myocardial calcification.
Little is known about the sites of action for the behavioral effects of chronic antidepressants. The novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test is one of few animal behavioral tests sensitive to acute benzodiazepines and chronic antidepressants. The goals of these experiments were to examine patterns of brain activation associated with the behavioral response to novelty and identify regions that could regulate the anxiolytic effects of acute benzodiazepine and chronic antidepressant treatments, measured using the NIH test. In the first experiment, rats were treated acutely with the anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, i.p.). In separate experiments, animals were implanted with osmotic minipumps delivering vehicle or fluoxetine (5 or 20 mg/kg per day s.c.) for 3 or 28 days. NIH was assessed by giving animals access to a familiar palatable food in a novel environment. Associated brain areas were identified using c-fos immunohistochemistry. NIH was mitigated by acute chlordiazepoxide and chronic fluoxetine. Both drugs reversed novelty-induced changes in c-fos expression in the lateral division of the posterolateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (STLP), cingulate cortex (Cg), and dorsal field CA2 of the hippocampus (dCA2). Chronic fluoxetine additionally increased c-fos expression in the anterior nucleus accumbens (aAcb) and the piriform cortex (Pir). The effects of the drugs on c-fos expression in many regions correlated with anxiolytic efficacy. These findings identified brain regions where the effects of chronic antidepressants and benzodiazepines may converge to produce anxiolytic activity, as well as distinct sites of action for the two classes of drugs.
To inform clinicians about the types of seizures that can be induced by clozapine and to provide recommendations for treatment.
We identified articles on clozapine-induced seizures from a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature from 1978 to July 2006. The frequency of each type of seizure and the dosages of clozapine associated with seizures were compiled. In addition to this review, we report a new case illustrating the challenge of diagnosing subtle seizure activity.
The tonic-clonic variety is the most frequently described clozapine-induced seizure. Myoclonic and atonic seizures together constitute about one-quarter of the reported seizures. The mean dosage of clozapine associated with seizures is not high (less than 600 mg daily).
It may be difficult for clinicians to recognize subtle types of clozapine-induced seizures, such as myoclonic, atonic, or partial seizures. Clinicians should not place excessive reliance on the plasma level of clozapine or electroencephalogram findings to predict the occurrence of seizures. When a first seizure occurs, it is recommended that the dosage of clozapine be reduced or an alternative antipsychotic agent be employed. If a second seizure occurs, an anticonvulsant drug should be started. Special attention should be paid when commencing or discontinuing concurrent medication that may affect the plasma level of clozapine.
The efficacy and safety of loxapine were evaluated in 18 acutely ill schizophrenic criminal offenders in the Essex County Jail. The offender patients were treated for three days with intramuscular loxapine (25 mg three or four times a day), followed by seven days of oral concentrate (up to 150 mg/day in three or four divided doses). Psychiatric status was determined with the Brief Psychiatric Rating and the Clinical Global impression scales at the time of admission, after 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours, amd on days 7 and 10 of medication. Three patients did not complete treatment: one was released on bail after 24 hours of therapy, and the other two had adverse reactions (tongue swelling and muscle spasms, each in one patient) which required cessation of treatment. Statistically significant improvement in both rating scale results was evident as early as 8 hours after treatment began. By day 10, all Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale items and factors and the Clinical Global impression results were statistically improved over baseline measurements. At the end of the study, 87 per cent (13/15) of the patients were well enough to cooperate with their attorneys and understand the procedures of the court. Adverse effects (generally extrapyramidal) appeared in four of 18 patients during parenteral administration and in two of 15 patients during oral therapy.
We reviewed our database of 312 patients with pulmonary embolism who received thrombolysis in five clinical trials. At baseline, none had a history of stroke, internal bleeding within 6 months, surgery within 10 days, or occult blood in stool. Sixty-six major bleeding episodes occurred within 72 hours of administering thrombolysis in 61 (20%) patients: bleeding at the catheterization site (34 cases), gross hematuria (9), intracranial hemorrhage (5), and 18 other bleeding episodes that led to at least a 10% hematocrit decrease. Patients with a major bleeding complication were on average older than patients with no hemorrhagic complication (mean age 62.9 +/- 1.9 years vs 56.2 +/- 1.1 years; p = 0.005). In an adjusted analysis, there was a fourfold increased risk of bleeding among patients older than 70 years compared with patients younger than 50 years (relative risk [RR] 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7 to 8.9). By using age as a continuous variable, we found a 4% (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) increase in risk of bleeding for each incremental year of age. In addition, patients with higher body mass index had an increased risk of bleeding. Patients who had undergone catheterization had a five times greater risk of bleeding (RR 5.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 17.8). In summary, increasing age, larger body mass index, and catheterization predisposed to bleeding complications after pulmonary embolism thrombolysis.
We have studied prostaglandin E1-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in the rat hindpaw, by assessing paw-withdrawal thresholds, before and after injecting prostaglandin E1 alone or with other agents, in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In normal and diabetic rats, prostaglandin E1 (1-1000 ng) produced a dose-dependent decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold. In diabetic rats, prostaglandin E1 was more potent than in normal rats, in producing hyperalgesia, whereas prostaglandin E2 hyperalgesia was not changed in normal and diabetic rats. Prostaglandin E1-induced hyperalgesia was not inhibited by E-type 1 prostaglandin receptor antagonists, SC19220 or SC51089, either in normal or diabetic rats. In fact, in the presence of SC19220, prostaglandin E1 produced enhanced hyperalgesia, in normal rats. Prostaglandin E1 hyperalgesia was not significantly modified by sympathectomy or indomethacin. Unlike prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin E1 hyperalgesia was not blocked by the inhibitor of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). It is suggested that prostaglandin E1 decreases primary afferent nociceptive threshold directly, by activating a prostaglandin receptor other than the E-type 1 prostaglandin receptor, and that this receptor is not coupled to a stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein.
