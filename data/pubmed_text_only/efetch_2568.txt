This study, designed and conducted as part of the International Life Sciences Institute working group on the Application of Genomics and Proteomics, examined the changes in the expression profile of genes associated with the administration of three different nephrotoxicants--cisplatin, gentamicin, and puromycin--to assess the usefulness of microarrays in the understanding of mechanism(s) of nephrotoxicity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with daily doses of puromycin (5-20 mg/kg/day for 21 days), gentamicin (2-240 mg/kg/day for 7 days), or a single dose of cisplatin (0.1-5 mg/kg). Groups of rats were sacrificed at various times after administration of these compounds for standard clinical chemistry, urine analysis, and histological evaluation of the kidney. RNA was extracted from the kidney for microarray analysis. Principal component analysis and gene expression-based clustering of compound effects confirmed sample separation based on dose, time, and degree of renal toxicity. In addition, analysis of the profile components revealed some novel changes in the expression of genes that appeared to be associated with injury in specific portions of the nephron and reflected the mechanism of action of these various nephrotoxicants. For example, although puromycin is thought to specifically promote injury of the podocytes in the glomerulus, the changes in gene expression after chronic exposure of this compound suggested a pattern similar to the known proximal tubular nephrotoxicants cisplatin and gentamicin; this prediction was confirmed histologically. We conclude that renal gene expression profiling coupled with analysis of classical end points affords promising opportunities to reveal potential new mechanistic markers of renal toxicity.
Two cases of sensory-motor neuropathy attributed to perhexilene maleate are described. The clinical and pathological features of perhexilene neuropathy are discussed. The use of perhexilene should be tempered with caution. Nerve conduction studies may be useful in confirming early neuropathy.
Recent studies strongly link nephrogenic systemic fibrosis to gadolinium administration for magnetic resonance imaging. In a recent advisory, the Food and Drug Administration stated that all gadolinium-containing chelates are potentially associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; however, most reported cases are linked to gadodiamide (Omniscan) and gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist). Given the severe consequences of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, it is critical to define the risks associated with each gadolinium-containing chelate. The purpose of this study was to examine nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk in a hemodialysis population exposed to gadoteridol (ProHance).
Appointment logs were used to generate a database of all long-term hemodialysis patients at the Dallas Veterans Affairs hospital since August 2001. These patients were then examined in the Veterans Affair's electronic medical record system for gadolinium exposure during magnetic resonance imaging from 2000 through 2007, a period during which gadoteridol was the sole contrast agent used.
A total of 141 patients were identified with 198 gadoteridol exposures. No cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis were identified. The observed frequency of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis was compared with the expected frequency (2.4%) using one-way chi(2) and binomial analysis, yielding a P < 0.05, indicating that the result was not explained by chance alone.
It is concluded that the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis with gadoteridol in patients who are on long-term hemodialysis may be lower than with gadodiamide and gadopentetate dimeglumine.
The signaling pathways leading to the development of asbestos-associated diseases are poorly understood. Here we used normal and protein kinase C (PKC)-delta knockout (PKCdelta-/-) mice to demonstrate multiple roles of PKC-delta in the development of cell proliferation and inflammation after inhalation of chrysotile asbestos. At 3 days, asbestos-induced peribronchiolar cell proliferation in wild-type mice was attenuated in PKCdelta-/- mice. Cytokine profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids showed increases in interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 that were decreased in PKCdelta-/- mice. At 9 days, microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of lung tissues revealed increased mRNA levels of the profibrotic cytokine, IL-4, in asbestos-exposed wild-type mice but not PKCdelta-/- mice. PKCdelta-/- mice also exhibited decreased lung infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung, as well as increased numbers of B lymphocytes and plasma cells. These changes were accompanied by elevated mRNA levels of immunoglobulin chains. These data show that modulation of PKC-delta has multiple effects on peribronchiolar cell proliferation, proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokine expression, and immune cell profiles in lung. These results also implicate targeted interruption of PKC-delta as a potential therapeutic option in asbestos-induced lung diseases.
Isolated systolic hypertension is the predominant form of hypertension in the elderly population. Reduction of arterial compliance appears to contribute to the elevation of pulse pressure (PP) and among potential mechanisms, gradual vascular calcification, fragmentation of elastic lamellae, and augmentation of rigid component like collagen could contribute to increase aortic stiffening. Few experimental models of the disease are currently available.
To induce large artery calcification, rats were treated with warfarin and vitamin K(1) (WK) for 4 and 8 weeks, to inhibit the maturation of matrix Gla protein. The impact of chronic PP elevation was determined on large artery and cardiac remodeling and on aortic endothelial function.
The WK treatment led to aortic medial calcification and a proportional elevation of PP, attributable mainly to a selective elevation of systolic blood pressure. The chronic treatment also increased collagen, whereas elastin decreased in the aorta. Pulse wave velocity, an index of aortic stiffening, increased in rats treated with WK. However, indices of left ventricular and aortic hypertrophy and remodeling remained normal. In addition, the WK treatment did not modify the vasoconstriction to norepinephrine and endothelin-1, and the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside.
Chronic treatment with WK represents a new model of isolated systolic hypertension with several characteristics of the human disease. The relative ease to induce calcification in this model may help to foster more fundamental research, which is lacking in this type of hypertension.
Particulate matter (PM) pollution adversely affects the airways, with asthmatic subjects thought to be especially sensitive. The authors hypothesised that exposure to diesel exhaust (DE), a major source of PM, would induce airway neutrophilia in healthy subjects, and that either these responses would be exaggerated in subjects with mild allergic asthma, or DE would exacerbate pre-existent allergic airways. Healthy and mild asthmatic subjects were exposed for 2 h to ambient levels of DE (particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 microm (PM10) 108 microg x m(-3)) and lung function and airway inflammation were assessed. Both groups showed an increase in airway resistance of similar magnitude after DE exposure. Healthy subjects developed airway inflammation 6 h after DE exposure, with airways neutrophilia and lymphocytosis together with an increase in interleukin-8 (IL-8) protein in lavage fluid, increased IL-8 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in the bronchial mucosa and upregulation of the endothelial adhesion molecules. In asthmatic subjects, DE exposure did not induce a neutrophilic response or exacerbate their pre-existing eosinophilic airway inflammation. Epithelial staining for the cytokine IL-10 was increased after DE in the asthmatic group. Differential effects on the airways of healthy subjects and asthmatics of particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 microm at concentrations below current World Health Organisation air quality standards have been observed in this study. Further work is required to elucidate the significance of these differential responses.
Clonidine is a frequently administered alpha2-adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure. We present a case of a 5-year-old child with cerebral palsy and seizure disorder, receiving clonidine for restlessness, who presented for placement of a baclofen pump. Without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of clonidine during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce anxiety. During induction of anesthesia, the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension requiring cardiac resuscitation. There are no previous reports of clonidine-associated cardiac arrest in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia.
Clopidogrel and ticlopidine are antiplatelet agents used in the treatment of patients with cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease and to reduce the risk for thrombosis in patients undergoing coronary artery stenting. Ticlopidine has been reported to have major hematologic adverse effects, including neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Clopidogrel, an analogue of ticlopidine, was developed because it did not show bone marrow toxic effects in either tissue culture or animal models. In human studies, to date, clopidogrel has been associated with a low incidence of severe neutropenia and no reported cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or HUS. For these reasons, clopidogrel has been increasingly used in place of ticlopidine after coronary artery stenting. We report a case of clopidogrel-associated HUS. This observation implicates clopidogrel as a possible causative agent in HUS.
Nitroprusside-induced hypotension evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation. Portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm. Application of a delayed feedback signal, in the form of a 2-h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane-anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis, is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested. Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate, which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms/dl. Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to nitroprusside-induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8-12 micrograms/dl. These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release.
The number of patients with non-insulin-dependent-diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is dramatically increasing in Japan and estimated to be 6 million, more than one of ten adults. It is well known that more than a half of diabetics are hypertensive. Therefore, it is very important to treat hypertension to reduce cardiovascular events as well as end-stage renal disease. At first, life style modification such as body weight reduction, exercise and restriction of salt and alcohol intake will be recommended. Improved glycemic control by such a non-pharmacological therapy will lower blood pressure. Recent studies demonstrated that hypoglycemic agents improving insulin resistance such as metformin and troglitazone reduce blood pressure. If these maneuvers do not lower blood pressure, hypotensive medication will be necessary. As a first line therapy, ACE inhibitor, alpha 1-blocker or Ca-channel blocker will be selected. In diabetics with proteinuria or micro-albuminuria, ACE inhibitors will be effective to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
The authors report a case of skeletal myopathy in a four-year-old boy on long-term sodium valproate therapy for secondary epilepsy due to neurocysticercosis. He presented with clinical features of limb girdle weakness. EMG revealed features of myopathy. Carnitine deficiency due to sodium valproate was suspected and plasma carnitine levels were found to be low. Sodium valproate was withdrawn. L-carnitine supplementation resulted in marked clinical recovery as well as rise in plasma carnitine levels.
Cashew nut-shell liquid and the contained anacardic acids (AAs) have been shown to possess antioxidant, lipoxygenase inhibitory, anti-Helicobacter pylori and antitumor properties. Despite these known effects, hitherto there were no published reports on their likely gastroprotective effects. The present study was designed to verify whether AAs afford gastroprotection against the ethanol-induced gastric damage and to examine the underlying mechanism(s). Gastric damage was induced by intragastric administration of 0.2mL of ethanol (96%). Mice in groups were pretreated orally with AAs (10, 30 and 100mg/kg), misoprostol (50 microg/kg), or vehicle (2% Tween 80 in saline, 10mL/kg), 45min before ethanol administration. They were sacrificed 30min later, the stomachs excised, and the mucosal lesion area (mm(2)) measured by planimetry. Gastroprotection was assessed in relation to inhibition of gastric lesion area. To study the gastroprotective mechanism(s), its relations to capsaicin-sensitive fibers, endogenous prostaglandins, nitric oxide and ATP-sensitive potassium channels were analysed. Treatments effects on ethanol-associated oxidative stress markers GSH, MDA, catalase, SOD, and total nitrate/nitrite levels as an index of NO were measured in gastric tissue. Besides, the effects of AAs on gastric secretory volume and total acidity were analysed in 4-h pylorus-ligated rat. AAs afforded a dose-related gastroprotection against the ethanol damage and further prevented the ethanol-induced changes in the levels of GSH, MDA, catalase, SOD and nitrate/nitrite. However, they failed to modify the gastric secretion or the total acidity. It was observed that the gastroprotection by AAs was greatly reduced in animals pretreated with capsazepine, indomethacin, l-NAME or glibenclamide. These results suggest that AAs afford gastroprotection principally through an antioxidant mechanism. Other complementary mechanisms include the activation of capsaicin-sensitive gastric afferents, stimulation of endogenous prostaglandins and nitric oxide, and opening of K(+)(ATP) channels. These combined effects are likely to be accompanied by an increase in gastric microcirculation.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates the proliferation of hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells and protects hepatocytes from apoptosis induced by various stimuli. In view of HGF induction by interferons, substances used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, this study was conducted to determine whether ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which is widely used for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases, modulates HGF production. UDCA did not induce HGF production in human dermal fibroblasts, but it potently inhibited phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)- and cholera-toxin-induced HGF production without affecting cell viability. The inhibitory effects of UDCA were as potent as those of transforming growth factor-beta1 and dexamethasone. Up-regulations of HGF gene expression induced by PMA and cholera toxin were also inhibited by UDCA. Moreover, UDCA dose-dependently inhibited high constitutive HGF production by MRC-5 cells without decreasing cell viability. Deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate, taurochenodeoxycholate and glycochenodeoxycholate also inhibited cholera-toxin-induced HGF production at non-cytotoxic doses. UDCA, however, had no apparent effect on PMA-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which is crucial for HGF induction by PMA. These results indicate that non-cytotoxic doses of UDCA inhibited constitutive and induced HGF production and suggest that UDCA supplemented with HGF or HGF inducers could have a more potential therapeutic effect.
Suckling "F/A2" mice, which overexpress arginase-I in their enterocytes, develop a syndrome (hypoargininemia, reduced hair and muscle growth, impaired B-cell maturation) that resembles IGF1 deficiency. The syndrome may result from an impaired function of the GH-IGF1 axis, activation of the stress-kinase GCN2, and/or blocking of the mTORC1-signaling pathway. Arginine deficiency inhibited GH secretion and decreased liver Igf1 mRNA and plasma IGF1 concentration, but did not change muscle IGF1 concentration. GH supplementation induced Igf1 mRNA synthesis, but did not restore growth, ruling out direct involvement of the GH-IGF1 axis. In C2C12 muscle cells, arginine withdrawal activated GCN2 signaling, without impacting mTORC1 signaling. In F/A2 mice, the reduction of plasma and tissue arginine concentrations to ∼25% of wild-type values activated GCN2 signaling, but mTORC1-mediated signaling remained unaffected. Gcn2-deficient F/A2 mice suffered from hypoglycemia and died shortly after birth. Because common targets of all stress kinases (eIF2α phosphorylation, Chop mRNA expression) were not increased in these mice, the effects of arginine deficiency were solely mediated by GCN2.
Sustained-release bupropion is commonly used for the symptomatic relief of depressive illness and as an adjuvant in smoking cessation therapy.
To report a case of bupropion-induced drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, including acute hepatitis, obstructive lung disease, and myositis.
After the patient discontinued use of bupropion, serologic tests, muscle biopsies, pulmonary function tests, a chest x-ray examination, venous Doppler ultrasounds, and an electrocardiogram were performed.
On discontinuation of bupropion and prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy, there was complete resolution of symptoms.
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome induced by bupropion therapy. We report this case to notify clinicians of the potential serious multisystem complications that can occur with sustained-release bupropion therapy.
Maitake mushroom has been reported to favorably influence hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of whole Maitake mushroom powder and two extracts designated as ether soluble (ES) and water soluble (WS) on Zucker fatty rats (ZFR), a model of insulin resistance, and on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a model of genetic hypertension. In the initial study, we followed four groups of eight ZFR and SHR receiving special diets: a baseline diet (BD), BD + whole Maitake mushroom powder (20% w/w), BD + fraction ES (0.10% w/w), and BD + WS (0.22% w/w). Different effects of these dietary regimens on the 2 rat strains were found. At 35 days, only consumption of the ES diet significantly decreased systolic BP (SBP) in SHR (average 197 vs. 176 mm Hg, p < 0.001), while in ZFR only the groups consuming the whole Maitake and WS diets showed significantly decreased SBP (138 vs. 120-125 mm Hg, p < 0.001). A challenge test with losartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker) indicates that angiotensin II does not play a major role in SBP regulation of ZFR, but does in SHR where consumption of ES relative to other groups significantly lowered activity of this system. In SHR, glucose, cholesterol, circulating insulin and HbA1C were virtually similar among all dietary groups; but whole Maitake (-22%), ES (-120%) and WS (-80%) diets were associated with decreased triglycerides, and the ES diet with lowered serum creatinine (-29%). In ZFR, circulating insulin and HbA1C were significantly decreased in the whole Maitake powder and ES groups, and tended to be lower in the WS group compared to control. In the ensuing studies, we gavaged ZFR once daily with water (control), 44 mg fraction WS, or 44 mg fraction WS plus 100 microg niacin-bound chromium (NBC). Oral gavage of WS clearly lowered SBP and circulating glucose concentrations, more so with the addition of chromium. We conclude that the examined forms of Maitake mushroom have antihypertensive and antidiabetic potential which differ among rat strains. The ES fraction may decrease SBP in SHR via alteration in the renin-angiotensin system.
The objective of this work was to test the hypothesis that endurance training may be protective against in vivo doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy through mitochondria-mediated mechanisms. Forty adult (6-8 wk old) male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10/group): nontrained, nontrained + DOX treatment (20 mg/kg), trained (14 wk of endurance treadmill running, 60-90 min/day), and trained + DOX treatment. Mitochondrial respiration, calcium tolerance, oxidative damage, heat shock proteins (HSPs), antioxidant enzyme activity, and apoptosis markers were evaluated. DOX induces mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction, oxidative damage, and histopathological lesions and triggers apoptosis (P < 0.05, n = 10). However, training limited the decrease in state 3 respiration, respiratory control ratio (RCR), uncoupled respiration, aconitase activity, and protein sulfhydryl content caused by DOX treatment and prevented the increased sensitivity to calcium in nontrained + DOX-treated rats (P < 0.05, n = 10). Moreover, training inhibited the DOX-induced increase in mitochondrial protein carbonyl groups, malondialdehyde, Bax, Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio, and tissue caspase-3 activity (P < 0.05, n = 10). Training also increased by approximately 2-fold the expression of mitochondrial HSP-60 and tissue HSP-70 (P < 0.05, n = 10) and by approximately 1.5-fold the activity of mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of SOD (P < 0.05, n = 10). We conclude that endurance training protects heart mitochondrial respiratory function from the toxic effects of DOX, probably by improving mitochondrial and cell defense systems and reducing cell oxidative stress. In addition, endurance training limited the DOX-triggered apoptosis.
Dexanabinol, HU-211, a synthetic cannabinoid devoid of psychotropic effects, improves neurological outcome in models of brain trauma, ischemia and meningitis. Recently, HU-211 was found to inhibit brain tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) production after head injury. In the present study, we demonstrate the ability of HU-211 to suppress TNFalpha production and to rescue mice and rats from endotoxic shock after LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) inoculation. In BALB/c mice, a dose of 10 mg/kg LPS, injected i.p., caused 57% and 100% mortality, at 24 and 48 hr, respectively. HU-211, administered i.p. 30 min before lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduced lethality to 9 and 67% at these time points (P < .05). When coinjected with D-galactoseamine (i.p.), LPS was 100% lethal within 24 hr, whereas eight hourly injections of HU-211 caused mortality of C57BL/6 mice to drop to 10% (P < .001). Administration of LPS to Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in a 30% reduction in the mean arterial blood pressure within 30 min, which persisted for 3 hr. HU-211, given 2 to 3 min before LPS, completely abolished the typical hypotensive response. Furthermore, the drug also markedly suppressed in vitro TNFalpha production and nitric oxide generation (by >90%) by both murine peritoneal macrophages and rat alveolar macrophage cell line exposed to LPS. HU-211 may, therefore, have therapeutic implications in the treatment of TNFalpha-mediated pathologies.
Treatment with vanadium, a representative of a class of antidiabetic compounds, alleviates diabetic hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Oral administration of vanadium compounds in animal models and humans does not cause clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia, a common problem for diabetic patients with insulin treatment. Gene expression, using Affymetrix arrays, was examined in muscle from streptozotocin-induced diabetic and normal rats in the presence or absence of oral vanadyl sulfate treatment. This treatment affected normal rats differently from diabetic rats, as demonstrated by two-way ANOVA of the full array data. Diabetes altered the expression of 133 genes, and the expression of 30% of these genes dysregulated in diabetes was normalized by vanadyl sulfate treatment. For those genes, the ratio of expression in normal animals to the expression in diabetic animals showed a strong negative correlation with the ratio of expression in diabetic animals to the expression in diabetic animals treated with vanadyl sulfate (P = -0.85). The genes identified belong to six major metabolic functional groups: lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, muscle structure, protein breakdown and biosynthesis, the complement system, and signal transduction. The identification of oxidative stress genes, coupled with the known oxidative chemistry of vanadium, implicates reactive oxygen species in the action of this class of compounds. These results imply that early transition metals or compounds formed from their chemical interactions with other metabolites may act as general transcription modulators, a role not usually associated with this class of compounds.
This nested case-control study evaluated the association between depression and pesticide exposure among women.
The study population included 29,074 female spouses of private pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study between 1993 and 1997. Cases were women who had physician-diagnosed depression requiring medication. Lifetime pesticide use was categorized as never mixed/applied pesticides, low exposure (up to 225 days), high exposure (>225 days), and a history of diagnosed pesticide poisoning.
After adjustment for state, age, race, off-farm work, alcohol, cigarette smoking, physician visits, and solvent exposure, depression was significantly associated with a history of pesticide poisoning (odds ratio [OR] = 3.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.72-6.19) but not low (OR = 1.09; CI = 0.91-1.31) or high (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 0.91-1.31) cumulative pesticide exposure.
Pesticide poisoning may contribute to risk of depression.
Two patients developed acute sensorimotor polyneuropathy after intoxication with lithium carbonate. Nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and sural nerve biopsy proved it to be an axonal neuropathy. Recovery of muscle strength, reflexes, and sensory function started weeks after discontinuation of lithium therapy. One patient fully recovered within a year. In the literature we found nine other cases of lithium polyneuropathy.
A case of necrotizing enterocolitis in a 19-year old man treated for schizophrenic disorder, induced by a drug association involving clozapine and requiring surgical treatment, is presented. To our knowledge only few reports have described the occurrence of this complication with atypical antipsychotics. Evidence for linking this complication to clozapine was reinforced by the absence of any viral or bacterial infection. The authors present a review of similar cases, stress the potential hazards induced by such drug combinations and discuss supposed mechanisms of this enterocolitis.
In patients with spinal cord injury, cephalad spread of intrathecal (i.t.) medication could be delayed.
We used bispectral index and an observer scale to assess sedation after two different doses of i.t. clonidine in patients with or without spinal cord injury. Twelve patients with neurological deficit caused by trauma (Spinal Cord Injury, SCI) were compared with patients without neurological disease. They received 10 mg of i.t. bupivacaine with clonidine, with either 50 microg (low dose, n=6) or 150 microg (high dose, n=6) at L(2)-L(3). A further 12 patients, six with spinal trauma lesion and six healthy, received i.t. bupivacaine and 150 micro g of i.m. clonidine.
Sedation and a decrease in BIS occurred only in patients receiving 150 microg of clonidine. Onset of sedation and the decrease in BIS was delayed in most spinal cord injured patients whatever the route of administration (P<0.001). Duration of sedation was not different between the groups. Delayed sedation and decrease of BIS after i.t. clonidine in patients with spinal cord injury are similar than those observed after i.m. clonidine.
A systemic effect is likely to be the main reason for sedation.
Changes in the gene transcription of stress response genes in resident fish can be powerful biomarkers for the identification of sublethal impacts of environmental stressors on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we tested the effects of two reference toxicants, copper (Cu) and the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate [(S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate], on lethal (mortality) and sublethal endpoints (growth, swimming behavior, transcription levels of stress response genes) in juvenile (81-90-day-old) striped bass (Morone saxatilis). We established cellular stress response markers for proteotoxicity (HSP70, HSP90), phase I detoxification mechanism (CYP1A1), metal-binding (metallothionein), as well as immune-function and pathogen-defense (TGF-beta, Mx-protein, nRAMP). Quantitative real-time TaqMan PCR was used to examine tissue-specific changes in the transcriptome of liver, spleen, white muscle, anterior kidney and gills after 7-day Cu exposures and 24-h esfenvalerate exposures. On the transcriptome level, exposure to Cu showed strongest effects on the transcription of metallothionein in spleen tissue, causing a 4-fold increase of mRNA at 42ppb total Cu and a 10-fold increase at 160 ppb Cu. Exposure to Cu also caused significant tissue-specific changes in gene transcription for immune-system related genes. Esfenvalerate exposure had tissue-specific effects on the transcription of HSP70, HSP90 and CYP1A1. The most significant effects were detected in liver tissue after exposure to 0.64 microg/L esfenvalerate. Our results show that the stress response at the transcriptome level is a more sensitive indicator for Cu and esfenvalerate exposures at low concentrations than swimming behavior, growth or mortality. The accuracy of studies on quantitative changes in the transcriptome can benefit from an initial evaluation or the inclusion of several different tissues and the use of multiple housekeeping genes.
