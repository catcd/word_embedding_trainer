Nogalamycin, an antitumor antibiotic, has been converted to a series of analogs by removal of the carbomethoxy group at C-10 and replacement of the neutral sugar at C-7 by other groups. Removal of the carbomethoxy group to give disnogamycin (6) followed by acidic alcoholysis gave pairs of isomeric 7-alkoxy compounds differing in configuration at C-7. Treatment of 6 with trifluoroacetic acid followed by nucleophiles gave a series of analogs having substituents at C-7 with a configuration at C-7 opposite to that of nogalamycin. Among the analogs prepared, 7-con-O-methylnogarol (7) is a highly active antitumor agent.
Birth weight within the normal range is associated with a variety of adult-onset diseases, but the mechanisms behind these associations are poorly understood. Previous genome-wide association studies of birth weight identified a variant in the ADCY5 gene associated both with birth weight and type 2 diabetes and a second variant, near CCNL1, with no obvious link to adult traits. In an expanded genome-wide association meta-analysis and follow-up study of birth weight (of up to 69,308 individuals of European descent from 43 studies), we have now extended the number of loci associated at genome-wide significance to 7, accounting for a similar proportion of variance as maternal smoking. Five of the loci are known to be associated with other phenotypes: ADCY5 and CDKAL1 with type 2 diabetes, ADRB1 with adult blood pressure and HMGA2 and LCORL with adult height. Our findings highlight genetic links between fetal growth and postnatal growth and metabolism.
A new experimental epileptic focus is described in which colchicine is topically applied to neocortex. Stable epileptiform discharges developed, with bursts of action potentials, coincident with the surface epileptiform events. There were depolarizing and hyperpolarizing neuronal potentials and glial depolarizations concomitantly with the surface epileptic spikes.
The effect of the anti-hypertensive drug eprosartan on metabolic parameters is currently not extensively documented. We evaluated the effect of eprosartan on parameters involved in atherogenesis, oxidative stress and clotting activity. This open-label unblinded intervention study included 40 adult patients with essential hypertension taking eprosartan. Eprosartan significantly reduced by 8% (p<0.001) the systolic and by 13% (p<.001) the diastolic blood pressure, and in-creased by 24% the time needed to produce oxidative by-products (p=0.001), a marker of oxidative stress. In contrast, ep-rosartan did not alter 8-isoprostane (8-epiPGF2a) levels, another marker of oxidative stress. Additionally, eprosartan re-duced by 14% aspartate aminotransferase and by 21% then alanine aminotransferase activity, while it had a neutral effect on the lipid profile and apolipoprotein levels and did not influence glucose homeostasis, creatinine and uric acid levels. Eprosartan did not affect the clotting/fibrinolytic status (estimated by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, tissue plasmino-gen activator and a2 antiplasmin levels), or the enzymatic activity of the lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1). In conclusion, eprosartan should be mainly considered as an anti-hypertensive agent with neutral effects on most of the metabolic parameters in hypertensive patients.
p-tert-Butylphenol-formaldehyde resin (PTBPFR) is a contact allergen that is included in most standard patch test series. This resin consists of a large number of substances most of which are unknown.
The aim of this study was to investigate if allergens in PTBPFR are molecules mainly of low (MW < 250), medium, or high molecular weight (MW > 1,000); to isolate and identify some of the low molecular weight components of the resin; and for new substances to determine if these were allergens.
Gel permeation chromatography, patch testing, high-pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry were used.
Patch test reactions indicated allergens in low-, medium-, and high-molecular-weights fractions. The strongest patch test reactivity was seen to a medium molecular weight fraction constituting only 6% wt/wt of the resin for 4 of the patients. Two patients reacted positively to low molecular weight fractions, and one of these patients reacted only to these fractions. The following substances were isolated: 4-tert-butyl-[1,2]benzoquinone, 4-tert-butyl-2,6-bis-hydroxymethyl-phenol, 4-tert-butylbenzene-1,2-diol, 4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxymethyl-phenol, 5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl-benzaldehyde, 4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxymethyl-6-methoxymethyl-phenol, and p-tert-butylphenol. Patients reacted positively to 5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl-benzaldehyde and 4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxymethyl-6-methoxymethyl-phenol but not to 4-tert-butyl-[1,2]benzoquinone.
Two new allergens in PTBPFR were found: 5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl-benzaldehyde and 4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxymethyl-6-methoxymethyl-phenol.
The preventive effect of betamipron (N-benzoyl-3-propionic acid: BP) on the renal uptake and nephrotoxicity of carbapenems (panipenem and imipenem) was studied in rabbits. Panipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic, induced nephrotoxicity at a dose of 200 mg/kg, i.v., but this was less severe than that caused by a single dose of imipenem or cephaloridine. Along with the significant reduction of nephrotoxicity, the uptake of these carbapenems in the renal cortex was remarkably inhibited by simultaneous treatment with BP (200 mg/kg, i.v.). These results suggest that BP reduces the nephrotoxicity of carbapenems through inhibiting the active transport of carbapenems in the renal cortex. Because of the low toxicity of BP (LD50 in the rat, more than 3,000 mg/kg, i.v.), it was concluded that BP might be a good candidate for reducing the nephrotoxicity induced by panipenem or imipenem.
Oleoyl-estrone (OE) has been presented as a potential antiobesity therapeutic, but the published series of studies from one laboratory has not yet been independently confirmed, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown. Based on the hypothesis that OE has potential for the treatment of obesity, male and female rats were chronically treated with several doses of OE to evaluate the impact of this compound on energy metabolism. Body weight, body composition, energy balance parameters and the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides regulating food intake as well as key markers of the reproductive system were examined. OE impressively reduced food consumption and body weight gain in both sexes. Although a major part of the loss in body weight could be explained by decreased fat mass, a substantial loss of lean mass also occurred after OE administration. The loss of weight can be sufficiently explained by the suppression of food consumption, as there were no major changes in energy expenditure, locomotor activity or respiratory quotient. In situ hybridization data showed no significant change in the expression of key neuropeptides and hormone receptors regulating feeding behavior after OE treatment. Cocaine-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) mRNA levels were decreased in the arcuate nucleus of OE-treated rats. Hypogonadism and low plasma testosterone levels were found in OE-treated males, whereas females showed substantially increased liver size. The present data suggest that OE decreases food intake and body weight but also appears to cause a significant impact on the hypothalamus-pituitary-reproductive axis.
In patients hypersensitive to phenol formaldehyde resin (PFR) it is, for therapeutic and preventive reasons, important to know the identity of the primary sensitizing substances, their sensitizing capacity, as well as their cross-reaction patterns. When elucidating the issue of cross reactivity in patients with contact allergy to simple methylol phenols (MP), o-cresol was shown to be a contact sensitizer. Besides cross reactivity, contamination of one or more MP(s) in o-cresol as well as o-cresol being a sensitizer of its own in PFR were possible explanations of the simultaneous positive patch test reactions to MP and o-cresol.
The aim of this study was to investigate if the simultaneous allergic reactions to PFR and o-cresol could be explained by the presence of this substance in PFR.
Patch testing, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR), gas chromatography (GC), and mass spectrometry (MS) were used.
o-Cresol was isolated from the specific PFR used in our standard patch test series and identified. The concentration in the resin was 0.066% wt/wt.
The current study establishes o-cresol as a contact sensitizer in a PFR. The observed reactions to o-cresol could be on the basis of cross reactivity or primary sensitization.
Sixty-seven cases of visceral leishmaniasis managed at the Rabat Hospital for Children from 1979 through 1988 were studied retrospectively. Mode of onset and outcome were analyzed. Clinical manifestations included enlargement of the spleen (60 cases), fever (45 cases), enlargement of the liver (38 cases), and weight loss (53 cases). Six patients had misleading onset manifestations including one case each of pigmentary lithiasis, severe marasmus without enlargement of the spleen, nephrotic syndrome, evidence of portal hypertension, jaundice, and an abdominal mass. Diagnosis was established by the bone marrow study (positive in 58 of 66 patients) or by indirect immunofluorescence (positive in 21 of 24 patients, including 6 with a negative bone marrow study). In one patient, the parasite was recovered from a jejunal biopsy specimen. Drugs used included N-methyl-glucamine in 86 cases, pentamidine in 26 cases, and sodium gluconate stibio in one case. Complete recovery was achieved in 24 patients. Seven patients failed to respond to therapy. There were 8 deaths, including 4 prior to initiation of therapy; among these four deaths, three were due to acute anemia. Another patient died after leaving the hospital despite the physician's advice to the contrary. The 3 remaining deaths were caused by toxicity of the drugs used. Thirty-one patients were lost to follow-up after initial improvement. The severity of this disease and cost of management make earlier diagnosis and faultless management imperative.
We investigated the kinetics of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their regulatory factors mRNAs in the kidneys of mercuric chloride-treated Brown Norway rats. The expression of MMP-1 mRNA remained at lower levels than control, while other MMPs mRNAs were upregulated. The expression of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 mRNA showed significant upregulation. On the other hand, the expressions of TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 mRNAs were not significantly changed. In the plasmin-dependent pathway, the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) mRNA was continuously increased, while the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) mRNA was not increased. The signals of TIMP-1 and PAI-1 mRNAs examined by in situ hybridization, were localized in the regenerative epithelial cells of the proximal tubules. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the activity of MMPs may bealtered by MMP-1 downregulation and inhibition of MMP activity by PAl-1 and TIMP-1 generated from tubular epithelial cells.
Fusariosis is an emerging infectious complication of immune deficiency, but models to study this infection are lacking. The use of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model host to study the pathogenesis of Fusarium spp. was investigated. We observed that Fusarium conidia consumed by C. elegans can cause a lethal infection and result in more than 90% killing of the host within 120 hours, and the nematode had a significantly longer survival when challenged with Fusarium proliferatum compared to other species. Interestingly, mycelium production appears to be a major contributor in nematode killing in this model system, and C. elegans mutant strains with the immune response genes, tir-1 (encoding a protein containing a TIR domain that functions upstream of PMK-1) and pmk-1 (the homolog of the mammalian p38 MAPK) lived significantly shorter when challenged with Fusarium compared to the wild type strain. Furthermore, we used the C. elegans model to assess the efficacy and toxicity of various compounds against Fusarium. We demonstrated that amphotericin B, voriconazole, mancozeb, and phenyl mercury acetate significantly prolonged the survival of Fusarium-infected C. elegans, although mancozeb was toxic at higher concentrations. In conclusion, we describe a new model system for the study of Fusarium pathogenesis and evolutionarily preserved host responses to this important fungal pathogen.
An increase in cocaine abuse by pregnant women has been associated with a range of maternal/fetal cardiovascular complications. Intracerebral hemorrhage has been reported as a cocaine-related complication, but has not previously been associated with pregnancy. We report a case of cocaine-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the postpartum period which complicated the differential diagnosis and management of hypertension and seizures.
Arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (As3mt) catalyzes reactions which convert inorganic arsenic to methylated metabolites. This study determined whether the As3mt null genotype in the mouse modifies cytotoxic and proliferative effects seen in urinary bladders of wild type mice after exposure to inorganic arsenic. Female wild type C57BL/6 mice and As3mt KO mice were divided into 3 groups each (n=8) with free access to a diet containing 0, 100 or 150 ppm of arsenic as arsenite (As(III)). During the first week of As(III) exposure, As3mt KO mice exhibited severe and lethal systemic toxicity. At termination, urinary bladders of both As3mt KO and wild type mice showed hyperplasia by light microscopy. As expected, arsenic-containing granules were found in the superficial urothelial layer of wild type mice. In As3mt KO mice these granules were present in all layers of the bladder epithelium and were more abundant and larger than in wild type mice. Scanning electron microscopy of the bladder urothelium of As3mt KO mice treated with 100 ppm As(III) showed extensive superficial necrosis and hyperplastic changes. In As3mt KO mice, livers showed severe acute inflammatory changes and spleen size and lymphoid areas were decreased compared with wild type mice. Thus, diminished arsenic methylation in As3mt KO mice exacerbates systemic toxicity and the effects of As(III) on the bladder epithelium, showing that altered kinetic and dynamic behavior of arsenic can affect its toxicity.
5-fluorouracil is a drug that is widely used in cancerology. Its cardiotoxicity must be known, as it is not exceptional and potentially dangerous. Two cases are reported in which the coronary insufficiency was documented and recurred when 5-fluorouracil was reintroduced. The mechanism of cardiac toxicity seems to be coronary spasm, as shown by exercise tests and the normal results of coronary arteriography. It seems preferable to refrain from using 5-fluorouracil after a recent myocardial infarction or in patients with unstable angina. Reintroduction of the drug is usually followed by recurrence of cardiotoxicity, even under coronary vasodilators.
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, which causes liver injury in animals and humans, activates c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Although it was shown that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 effectively reduced APAP hepatotoxicity, the mechanisms of protection remain unclear. C57Bl/6 mice were treated with 10mg/kg SP600125 or vehicle (8% dimethylsulfoxide) 1h before 600mg/kg APAP administration. APAP time-dependently induced JNK activation (detected by JNK phosphorylation). SP600125, but not the vehicle, reduced JNK activation, attenuated mitochondrial Bax translocation and prevented the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor at 4-12h. Nuclear DNA fragmentation, nitrotyrosine staining, tissue GSSG levels and liver injury (plasma ALT release and necrosis) were partially attenuated by the vehicle (-65%) and completely eliminated by SP600125 (-98%) at 6 and 12h. Furthermore, SP600125 attenuated the increase of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein. However, APAP did not enhance plasma nitrite+nitrate levels (NO formation); SP600125 had no effect on this parameter. The iNOS inhibitor L-NIL did not reduce NO formation or injury after APAP but prevented NO formation caused by endotoxin. Since SP600125 completely eliminated the increase in hepatic GSSG levels, an indicator of mitochondrial oxidant stress, it is concluded that the inhibition of peroxynitrite was mainly caused by reduced superoxide formation. Our data suggest that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 protects against APAP-induced liver injury in part by attenuation of mitochondrial Bax translocation but mainly by preventing mitochondrial oxidant stress and peroxynitrite formation and thereby preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, a key event in APAP-induced cell necrosis.
Inbred, congenic, and intra-H-2-recombinant mouse strains were given subcutaneous injections of either 1.6 mg HgCl2/kg body wt or 0.1 ml NaCl thrice weekly for 5-6 weeks. Mercury-treated mice from strains carrying the H-2s haplotype developed antinucleolar antibodies (ANoA), which targeted the 34-kDa nucleolar protein fibrillarin, and in some instances also nucleolar proteins of 60-70 and 10-15 kDa, the latter corresponding to histones. Strains with H-2b and H-2d haplotypes were resistant to induction of ANoA. The susceptibility to development of AnoA/antifibrillarin antibodies (AFA) was mapped to the H-2A-region using intra-H-2-recombinant strains. We were not able to confirm earlier reports that expression of H-2E genes dampens the development of ANoA. Mercury treatment caused a substantial increase in the titer of antichromatin (ACA) and/or antihistone (AHA) antibodies in a fraction of SJL/J, A.SW, A.TH, B10.S, and B10.HTT mice (H-2s), and in A/J (H-2k) mice, whereas mice from the C57BL/6J and C57BL/10J (H-2b), and the DBA and BALB/c (H-2d) strains were low or nonresponders. The development of AHA and ACA could not be linked to the H-2 complex. A significant, substantial increase of granular mesangial and systemic vessel wall IgG deposits occurred in mice with serum ANoA/AFA. However, the B10.S(9R) and B10.HTT strains, which express the H-2E genes, developed only an intermediately increased titer of mesangial IgG deposits. Systemic vessel wall IgG deposits occurred in only 60-80% of the B10.S(9R) mice and in none of the B10.HTT mice. This contrasted with the high titer of mesangial IgG deposits and uniform development of systemic vessel wall IgG deposits observed in B10.S mice not expressing H-2E. Mice with mesangial IgG deposits showed a mild glomerulonephritis. There was no systemic vasculitis. The susceptibility to development of ANoA, AHA, ACA, and systemic, granular IgG deposits in the B10.S strain was influenced by the sex, since males showed less uniform development of these immunopathologic features than females.
OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias have been a surprising side-effect of intrastriatal foetal ventral mesencephalic transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease. It has been proposed that excessive and unregulated dopaminergic stimulation of host post-synaptic striatal neurons by the grafts could be responsible for these dyskinesias. To address this issue we transplanted foetal dopaminergic neurons from mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DATKO) or from wild-type mice, into a rat model of Parkinson's disease and L-dopa-induced dyskinesias. Both wild-type and DATKO grafts reinnervated the host striatum to a similar extent, but DATKO grafts produced a greater and more diffuse increase in extra-cellular striatal dopamine levels. Interestingly, grafts containing wild-type dopaminergic neurons improved parkinsonian signs to a similar extent as DATKO grafts, but provided a more complete reduction of L-dopa induced dyskinesias. Neither DATKO nor wild-type grafts induced OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias. Behavioural and receptor autoradiography analyses demonstrated that DATKO grafts induced a greater normalization of striatal dopaminergic receptor supersensitivity than wild-type grafts. Both graft types induced a similar downregulation and normalization of PEnk and fosb/Deltafosb in striatal neurons. In summary, DATKO grafts causing high and diffuse extra-cellular dompamine levels do not per se alter graft-induced recovery or produce OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias. Wild-type dopaminergic neurons appear to be the most effective neuronal type to restore function and reduce L-dopa-induced dyskinesias.
Three infants, born of two mothers with inflammatory bowel disease who received treatment with sulphasalazine throughout pregnancy, were found to have major congenital anomalies. In the singleton pregnancy, the mother had ulcerative colitis, and the infant, a male, had coarctation of the aorta and a ventricular septal defect. In the twin pregnancy, the mother had Crohn's disease. The first twin, a female, had a left Potter-type IIa polycystic kidney and a rudimentary left uterine cornu. The second twin, a male, had some features of Potter's facies, hypoplastic lungs, absent kidneys and ureters, and talipes equinovarus. Despite reports to the contrary, it is suggested that sulphasalazine may be teratogenic.
The heat shock response involves activation of heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1) followed by the rapid synthesis of the protective heat shock proteins (Hsps). To determine if the stress experienced during streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes altered the heat shock response, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 33; 280-300 g) were assigned to 4 groups: (1) control, (2) diabetic (30 days after 55 mg/kg STZ i.v.), (3) heat stressed (42 degrees C for 15 minutes), and (4) diabetic heat-stressed group (heat stressed 42 degrees C for 15 minutes, 30 days after 55 mg/kg STZ i.v.). The content of Hsp72, Hsp25, and Hsf1 in skeletal muscles, heart, kidney, and liver was assessed by Western blotting, while electrophoretic mobility shift gel analysis was used to assess Hsf activation. Without heat stress, the constitutive expression of Hsp25, Hsp72, and Hsf1 in tissues from diabetic animals and controls was similar. However, 24 hours following heat stress, the heart, kidney, and liver from diabetic animals showed an increased Hsp72 and Hsp25 content compared to the same tissues from heat-stressed nondiabetic animals (P < 0.05). The white gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles from heat-stressed animals (diabetic and nondiabetic) both showed significant and similar elevations in Hsp72 content. Interestingly, while all muscles from nondiabetic animals showed significant (P < 0.05) increase in Hsp25 content after heat stress, no increase in Hsp25 content was detected in muscles from heat-stressed diabetic animals. As expected, Hsf activation was undetectable in all tissues from non-heat-stressed animals but was detectable in tissues from both diabetic and nondiabetic animals following heat stress with the exception of diabetic skeletal muscle, where it was attenuated. Hsf1 content was unaltered in all tissues examined except in the white gastrocnemius muscles from heat-stressed diabetic animals, where it was undetectable. These results suggest that when tissues from STZ-induced diabetic animals are heat stressed, the Hsp/stress response is altered in a tissue-specific manner. This impaired ability to activate the stress response may explain, at least in part, the selective atrophy of certain muscles or muscle fiber types during diabetes.
Primaquine-induced hemolytic anemia is known to result from premature sequestration of damaged (but intact) erythrocytes by the spleen. We have shown previously that a phenolic metabolite, 5-hydroxyprimaquine (5-HPQ), is a direct-acting hemolytic agent in rats, suggesting that 5-HPQ is a mediator of the hemolytic response to primaquine. To investigate the fate of erythrocytes in vivo after in vitro exposure to 5-HPQ, rat (51)Cr-labeled erythrocytes were incubated with hemolytic concentrations of 5-HPQ and then readministered intravenously to rats. The time course of loss of radioactivity from blood and uptake into the spleen and liver was measured. In rats given 5-HPQ-treated erythrocytes, an increased rate of removal of radioactivity from the circulation was observed as compared with the vehicle control. The loss of blood radioactivity was accompanied by a corresponding increase in radioactivity appearing in the spleen but not in the liver. When rats were pretreated with clodronate-loaded liposomes to deplete splenic macrophages, there was a decreased rate of removal of radioactivity from the circulation and a markedly diminished uptake into the spleen. A role for phagocytic removal of 5-HPQ-treated red cells was confirmed in vitro using the J774A.1 macrophage cell line. Furthermore, depletion of red cell GSH with diethyl maleate significantly enhanced in vitro phagocytosis of 5-HPQ-treated red cells. The data indicate that splenic macrophages are responsible for removing 5-HPQ-treated red cells and support the postulate that this metabolite is a contributor to the hemolytic anemia induced after administration of the parent compound.
A 65-year-old woman with bipolar disorder and complicated cardiovascular disease who was on maintenance lithium therapy developed a movement disorder following high doses of trazodone for treatment of an acute depression. When the trazodone was reduced, the involuntary movements promptly ceased. Although the movement disorder could not with certainty be attributed to trazodone alone, the drug at least acted as an eliciting agent.
Recently, mutations within the tau gene have been associated with some familial forms of frontotemporal dementia. To investigate whether tau gene mutations are also associated with Pick's disease, we analyzed the tau gene in 30 cases of pathologically confirmed Pick's disease. Two coding mutations were identified in separate cases of Pick's disease. A glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon 389 was detected in 1 case and a lysine-to-threonine mutation at codon 257 was identified in another. Analysis of dephosphorylated tau from the brain of the patient with the codon 389 mutation revealed a prominent band representing tau, with four microtubule-binding domains and no amino terminal inserts. This is in contrast to Pick's disease without any tau gene mutations, which consist of tau with mainly three microtubule-binding domains and only a trace of tau, with four microtubule-binding domains. Functional analysis of tau with these two mutations demonstrated a reduced ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly. Surprisingly, these mutations increased tau's susceptibility to calpain I digestion, suggesting that this feature may be related to the formation of a Pick type of histology. Moreover, these data suggest that Pick's disease is not a separate entity but part of the frontotemporal dementia disease spectrum.
Proteinuria is associated with a progressive loss of renal function; we recently found that both intrarenal effects of proteinuria and the state of systemic nephrosis play an independent role in proteinuria-induced renal damage. Reduction of proteinuria is an important mechanism underlying the renoprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi). Both the reduction of proteinuria and the attenuation of the systemic state of nephrosis may be involved in the renoprotection by ACEi.
This article entails a post hoc analysis of a previous study on the renoprotective effect of ACEi lisinopril in adriamycin nephrosis. It was attempted to modify therapeutic efficacy of ACEi by increasing lisinopril dose and by dietary sodium restriction, respectively. In this analysis, we aimed to delineate the contribution of proteinuria reduction and the reduction of other intermediate parameters such as hyperlipidemia and blood pressure on the protection against focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS).
We found that in adriamycin nephrosis, ACEi significantly reduced proteinuria, lipids, and blood pressure and provided protection against FGS. Treatment modification by increasing the lisinopril dose resulted in a further reduction of FGS without significant effects on intermediate parameters (proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, and blood pressure), whereas surprisingly, treatment modification by sodium restriction resulted in a further attenuation of intermediate parameters, without additional protection against FGS.
The renoprotective benefit of an obtained attenuation of intermediate parameters is modified by other factors. Further optimization of renoprotective therapy requires identification of such factors and explicit consideration of therapeutic efficacy on intermediate parameters as well as hard end points.
The Car-R outbred mouse line was phenotypically selected for high resistance to two-stage skin tumorigenesis. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that a subset of genetic loci responsible for resistance to skin tumorigenesis of Car-R mice might also inhibit lung tumorigenesis. Skin and lung tumorigenesis were induced in groups of Car-R, SWR/J, (SWR/JxCar-R)F1 and SWR/Jx(SWR/JxCar-R) backcross mice by i.p. urethane initiation and skin TPA promotion. Car-R mice showed a much lower susceptibility to both skin and lung tumorigenesis as compared to SWR/J mice, which are susceptible to both lung and skin tumorigenesis. The Car-R-inherited genome significantly inhibited both skin and lung cancer development in the F1 progeny of Car-R with SWR/J mice. In the backcross population, skin and lung tumor phenotypes showed a statistically significant correlation, indicating that a subset of the cancer resistance alleles, which segregated in the Car-R line during selection for resistance to skin carcinogenesis, provides resistance to both skin and lung tumorigenesis.
