Adverse health effects of exposures to acute air pollution have been well studied. Fewer studies have examined effects of chronic exposure. Previous studies used exposure estimates for narrow time periods and were limited by the geographic distribution of pollution monitors. This study examined the association of chronic particulate exposures with all-cause mortality, incident nonfatal myocardial infarction, and fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) in a prospective cohort of 66,250 women from the Nurses' Health Study in northeastern US metropolitan areas. Nonfatal outcomes were assessed through self-report and medical record review and fatalities through death certificates and medical record review. During follow-up (1992-2002), 3,785 deaths and 1,348 incident fatal CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred. In age- and calendar-time-adjusted models, 10-microg/m(3) increases in 12-month average exposures to particulate matter <10 microm in diameter were associated with increased all-cause mortality (16%, 95% confidence interval: 5, 28) and fatal CHD (43%, 95% confidence interval: 10, 86). Adjustment for body mass index and physical activity weakened these associations. Body mass index and smoking modified the association between exposure to particulate matter <10 microm in diameter and fatal CHD. In this population, increases in such exposures were associated with increases in all-cause and CHD mortality. Never smokers with higher body mass indexes were at greatest risk of fatal CHD.
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a significant clinical problem. Vitamin B(6) is a potent antioxidant and takes part in almost all of the possible mechanisms that are suggested as being associated with appearance of TD. The aims of this study were (1) to reexamine the efficacy and safety of higher doses of vitamin B(6) versus placebo in a greater sample of patients for a longer time and (2) to evaluate the carryover effect of vitamin B(6).
A 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a university-based research clinic from August 2002 to January 2005 on 50 inpatients with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and TD. In a double-blind crossover paradigm, all study subjects were randomly assigned to start treatment with either vitamin B(6) (daily dose of 1200 mg) or placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment and then a 2-week washout, subjects were crossed over to receive the other treatment for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in Extra-pyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) scores.
The mean decrease in ESRS clinical global impression scores from baseline to endpoint was 2.4 points in patients treated with vitamin B(6) and 0.2 points in patients treated with placebo (p < .0001). The mean decrease in the parkinsonism subscale score was 18.5 points and 1.4 points, respectively (p < .00001), and the mean decrease in the dyskinesia subscale score was 5.2 points and -0.8 points, respectively (p < .0001).
Vitamin B(6) appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of TD. The specific mechanisms by which vitamin B(6) attenuates symptoms of TD are not clear.
Parenchymatous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a serious, infrequent complication of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. We studied the clinical and radiologic features, manner of presentation, associated factors, and temporal course in 23 patients with ICH associated with 150 mg or 100 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and heparin therapy for acute myocardial infarction in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) II Pilot and Randomized Clinical Trial. In TIMI II, 13 of the 23 ICH patients developed or maintained systolic blood pressure > or = 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mm Hg during the rt-PA infusion and before the onset of neurologic symptoms. Six patients (26%) had life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, five before onset of neurologic symptoms. A decreased level of consciousness was the earliest neurologic abnormality in 15 (65%) and the most common initial physical finding (in 19, or 82%). Onset was usually gradual (70%), but time to maximal deficit was frequently (61%) within 6 hours of onset. The locations of the primary ICH sites were lobar in 16 (70%), thalamic in four (17%), and brainstem-cerebellum in three (13%), but the putamen was never the primary site. Multiple lobar hemorrhages occurred in six cases (26%). The timing and size of ICH was similar among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA and 100 mg rt-PA. Brain CT demonstrated an arteriovenous malformation in one case. Four patients had hypofibrinogenemia, which was profound in three patients. Pathologic findings were available for five patients. Of these, three patients had cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and one had hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic cerebral infarction found at autopsy. We conclude that ICH following rt-PA and heparin therapy for acute myocardial infarction presents as a distinctive clinical syndrome. Intracerebral bleeding after combined thrombolytic and antithrombotic therapy may be associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and other vascular lesions. Acute or persistent hypertension before or during rt-PA infusion, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and hypofibrinogenemia, either alone or in combination, may play roles in some cases. Care should be exercised when considering thrombolytic therapy for patients with risk factors for ICH.
Intravenous drug-addiction is one of the susceptible factors for the development of infectious endocarditis and cocaine, especially when administered intravenously, can produce damage at the level of the valvular endothelium. We have studied a group of cocaine addicts to evaluate the possible existence of valvular alterations. Ninety-eight patients, addicts to intravenous injection and/or nasal insufflation, have been studied with Doppler and echocardiography and they were compared with a non-addict group of fifty persons. Valvular lesions were defined as valvular enlarging and "beaded appearance" lesions. The average age of drug-addicts was 29.1 years (SD 8.31) with a maximum of 66 year and a minimum of 14 years. Ninety-three of them were males and forty-five of them admitted to be intravenous addicts. Twenty cases showed positive serology for HIV. All of them, except one, recognized having used the intravenous route. The control group was 27.78 years old (SD 3.49) and 96% were males. Valvular lesions were found in 22.45% of addicts while no one in the control group showed any lesion (p = 0.0007). Lesions were significantly larger in the tricuspid valve (p = 0.0004). No valvular dysfunction was detected in any of the studied cases. No differences have been noticed in valvular alterations among HIV infected patients with and without reactivity to the treatment. The prevalence of valvular affection considering the way of drug administration was significantly higher in patients with intravenous addiction compared to nasal insufflation addicts, 40% versus 7.5% (p = 0.0001). A percentage of cocaine addicts here studied presented valvular alterations research being the tricuspid valve the most frequently involved. No significant valvular failure has been detected. The observed lesions could correspond to the anatomic substratum of an endocardiac infection, frequently observed in intravenous drug-addicts with lesions, usually located in the tricuspid valve.
Wnts have been reported to play a key role in the lung morphogenesis. We have previously reported that pulmonary gene expression of Wnt2 and Wnt7b is downregulated on day 15 of gestation in the nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) model. However, the distribution pattern of gene expression of Wnts in the very early lung development remains unclear. Optical projection tomography (OPT) is a new technique for 3-dimensional imaging of small developing organs and gene distribution combined with whole-mount in situ hybridization. We designed this study to investigate the distribution pattern of Wnts gene expression in lung buds of nitrofen-induced CDH model using OPT.
Embryos from normal and nitrofen-treated dams were harvested on embryonic day 10 (E10), and divided into controls and nitrofen group, respectively. Whole-mount in situ hybridization to detect transcripts of Wnt2 and Wnt7b was performed, analyzed, and reconstructed using OPT.
The expression of Wnt2 transcripts was detected in the lung bud mesenchyme and markedly diminished in nitrofen group compared to controls, whereas Wnt7b transcripts were expressed in the mesoderm of bronchi and the lung bud with no detectable difference between 2 groups.
We provide evidence for the first time that Wnt2 expression is downregulated at lung bud stage in the nitrofen model. Optical projection tomography is potentially a useful approach to visualize both gene expression and morphology during very early stages of lung development.
Warfarin, the only available oral coumarin anticoagulant in South Africa, is widely prescribed for the prevention and management of arterial and venous thrombo-embolism. It has a narrow therapeutic index and a wide inter-individual variability in therapeutic response. Genetic polymorphism of the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes, as well as clinical factors such as age, gender, body mass index and interacting drugs explain less than 55% of variability in warfarin dose requirements. True warfarin resistance is rare (< 0.1%) and is defined as warfarin requirements greater than 70 mg per week to maintain the international normalised ratio (INR) in the target therapeutic range. As hereditary warfarin resistance is rare, non-adherence, laboratory errors and interactions should be excluded in patients with persistent sub-therapeutic INR levels. Pharmacogenetic models to estimate individualised warfarin doses do not take into account the mutations associated with warfarin resistance. In patients with presumed warfarin resistance, higher doses that maintain the INR in the target therapeutic range should be given, and the INR closely and regularly monitored.
Promising new techniques in the management of vocal fold nodules have been developed in the past 2 years. Simultaneously, the therapeutic use of botulinum toxin has rapidly expanded. This review explores the use of botulinum toxin in treatment of vocal nodules and summarizes current therapeutic concepts.
New microsurgical instruments and techniques, refinements in laser technology, radiosurgical excision and steroid intralesional injections are all promising new techniques in the management of vocal nodules. Botulinum toxin-induced 'voice rest' is a new technique we have employed in patients with recalcitrant nodules. Successful resolution of nodules is possible with this technique, without the risk of vocal fold scarring inherent in dissection/excision techniques. Botulinum toxin usage is exponentially increasing, and large-scale, long-term studies demonstrate its safety profile.
Targeted vocal fold temporary paralysis induced by botulinum toxin injection is a new, well tolerated and efficacious treatment in patients with persistent vocal fold nodules.
Sulindac and other NSAIDs have been widely studied as potential chemopreventive agents for colon cancer. Short-term studies have shown adenomatous polyps to regress in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In this study the effect of sulindac on cancer as an endpoint was evaluated in ApcMin mice, a preclinical model of FAP with an Apc mutation in codon 850 that leads to gastrointestinal adenomas and carcinomas. Three groups of mice were studied all of which were fed AIN-76A diet: one group was fed AIN-76A diet alone, a second group received sulindac 200 p.p.m. premixed in the diet and a third group received sulindac 180 p.p.m. added in drinking water. ApcMin mice were killed 9 weeks after feeding was initiated. Mice receiving sulindac developed fewer tumors in the intestine overall; the major decrease in tumor development after sulindac was seen in the small intestine regardless of route of administration. In the large intestine, however, sulindac significantly increased the incidence, multiplicity and volume of tumors in the colon of ApcMin mice, a regional response to sulindac differing from previous reports. Quantitative measurements of apoptosis, Bax and Bcl-xL protein expression in the ApcMin mice revealed the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL expression and apoptosis increased in the small intestine but decreased in the cecum, consistent with the regional tumorigenesis observed after sulindac. These findings thus suggest involvement of Bax and apoptosis in tumors developing after sulindac treatment in this mouse model.
Felodipine 4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-2,6-dimethyl-3,5- dicarboxylic 3-ethyl ester and 5-methyl ester, CAS 72509-76-3) is a new selective calcium antagonist for use in the management of hypertension or other cardiovascular disease, which requires reduction of peripheral vascular resistance. A combined 6- and 12-month study in dogs has been performed as a part of the preclinical safety program. 30 dogs, 5 males and 5 females per group, were treated with felodipine for 12 months. Additional 18 dogs, 3 males and 3 females per group, were interim-sacrificed after 6-month treatment. The dose levels were 2 x 0.38, 2 x 1.2 and 2 x 2.3 mg/kg daily. Initially, 2 x 3.8 mg/kg/d was used as a high dose. At this dose level 2 animals died preterminally after 4 days of dosing. They were replaced and the high dose level was reduced. Two similar control groups were given a placebo formulation for 12 and 6 months, respectively. All animals were treated b.i.d. using a 4-h time interval. Mucosal hyperemia and tachycardia, as an expression of the vasodilating properties of felodipine, were observed in a somewhat variable but dose-related manner. Noninflammatory gingival hyperplasia, similar to that after treatment with phenytoin and the calcium antagonist nifedipine, occurred with a propensity for the males after 12 months of treatment. Slight-degree gingival hyperplasia was also noted after 6 months of treatment. This change occurred dose- and time related in the medium and high dose groups but was absent in the low dose group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Previous studies from our group, focusing on neuro-glial remodelling in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), have shown the presence of immature vascular cells in various areas of the hippocampus. Here, we investigated angiogenic processes in hippocampi surgically removed from adult patients suffering from chronic intractable TLE, with various aetiologies. We compared hippocampi from TLE patients to hippocampi obtained after surgery or autopsy from non-epileptic patients (NE). We quantified the vascular density, checked for the expression of angiogenic factors and their receptors and looked for any blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. We used a relevant model of rat limbic epilepsy, induced by lithium-pilocarpine treatment, to understand the sequence of events. In humans, the vessel density was significantly higher in TLE than in NE patients. This was neither dependent on the aetiology nor on the degree of neuronal loss, but was positively correlated with seizure frequency. In the whole hippocampus, we observed many complex, tortuous microvessels. In the dentate gyrus, when the granular layer was dispersed, long microvessels appeared radially orientated. Vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) and tyrosine kinase receptors were detected in different types of cells. An impairment of the BBB was demonstrated by the loss of tight junctions and by Immunoglobulines G (IgG) leakage and accumulation in neurons. In the rat model of TLE, VEGF over-expression and BBB impairment occurred early after status epilepticus, followed by a progressive increase in vascularization. In humans and rodents, angiogenic processes and BBB disruption were still obvious in the chronic focus, probably activated by recurrent seizures. We suggest that the persistent leakage of serum IgG in the interstitial space and their uptake by neurons may participate in hypoperfusion and in neuronal dysfunction occurring in TLE.
One of the common features of damaged neurons in many neurodegenerative diseases is the presence of abnormal aggregates of the disease-related proteins. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of both sporadic and familial forms, protein aggregates are found in the affected spinal cords. In familial ALS with mutations in copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), the propensity of SOD1 for aggregation is known to increase with the mutation. In the present study, we examined whether the aggregate-prone SOD1 mutants induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the inhibition of the ER stress protects the cells. The ALS-related mutant G85R SOD1 and G93A SOD1 formed visible aggregates and caused cell death possibly by apoptosis when over-expressed in neuro2a cells. Interestingly, the rate of the mutant SOD1-induced cell death was greater than that of the visible aggregate formation. Expression of the mutant SOD1 caused signs of both early and late ER stress responses, namely, RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor alpha phosphorylation, Jun amino-terminal kinase activation, activating transcription factor 6-translocation, X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing, and caspase 12 activation. The X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing activation was also detected in the mutant SOD1-expressing cells even without the visible aggregates. The cell death induced by the mutant SOD1 over-expression looked like apoptosis as evidenced by nuclear morphology and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling. Importantly, an ER stress inhibitor, salubrinal delayed the formation of insoluble aggregates of the mutant SOD1 and suppressed the mutant-induced cell death. In addition, over-expression of the ER-targeted Bcl-xL protected the cells from the mutant SOD1-induced cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the misfolding of ALS-related mutant SOD1 induces ER stress possibly prior to the formation of visible aggregates, which may contribute to the motor neuron degeneration in ALS pathogenesis.
To estimate the effects of cocaine exposure on intrauterine growth and to investigate at what point in gestation growth deviation would be manifested.
This is a secondary analysis of data from a multicenter project, the Maternal Lifestyle Study, designed to determine infant outcomes of in utero cocaine or opiates exposure. Four centers of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network enrolled 11,811 maternal-infant dyads. A total of 1072 infants were cocaine exposed, 7565 were cocaine negative by maternal history and meconium results, and 3174 were excluded from analysis because of unconfirmed negative exposure. Outcome measures included birth weight, length, and head circumference.
Percentile estimates for birth weight, length, and head circumference revealed growth deceleration in cocaine-exposed infants evident after 32 weeks' gestation. There was significant interaction between cocaine and gestational age. After controlling for confounders, at 40 weeks' gestation, cocaine exposure was estimated to be associated with a decrease of 151 g, 0.71 cm, and 0.43 cm in birth weight, length, and head circumference, respectively. Smoking had a negative impact on all growth measurements, with some indication of a dose-effect relationship. Heavy alcohol use was associated with decrease in weight and length only. Opiates had significant effect only on birth weight.
In utero cocaine exposure is associated with growth deceleration involving all measurements, becoming more pronounced with advancing gestation.
Although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations, its role has not been definitely established. A case of fatal aplastic anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were given. Indomethacin was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. A positive lymphocyte transformation test with indomethacin in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing aplastic anemia in a susceptible patient. Fortunately, this seems to be a very rare complication.
Vincristine sulfate is a chemotherapeutic agent used in different cancer therapies. It is also the first choice of treatment for peripheral T-cell lymphoma with cyclophosphamide and adriamycin. Sudden hearing loss during vincristine therapy is a very rare event. This is a case of a 16-year old girl who developed sudden bilateral hearing loss related to vincristine therapy.
Mithramycin is an inhibitor of the binding of the Sp-family transcription factor to the GC box. Many studies show that mithramycin may reduce the expression of many oncogenes by inhibiting the mRNA and protein synthesis and it has been used as an antibiotic chemotherapy drug for a long time. Recently, Eps8 (EGFR pathway substrate 8) has been revealed to be a novel proto-oncogene related to cellular transformation, Rac activation and actin barbed-end-capping activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify whether Eps8 might be regulated by mithramycin. Results showed that mithramycin could reduce the mRNA and protein levels of Eps8 in dose- and time-dependent manners in several cancer cell lines. Furthermore, cell growth and migration ability were also reduced significantly by mithramycin treatment. Since Src is a well-known Eps8 activity enhancer, a v-Src transfected IV5 cell line was subjected to mithramycin treatment and then analyzed to show that Src expression was unable to restore the mithramycin-induced decrease in Eps8 expression, cell growth, and migration ability. To further confirm the above mentioned results, the expression of Eps8 was eliminated by a transient transfection with siRNA and subsequent analysis showed that silencing of Eps8 might also lead to a reduced growth and migration ability of cancer cells. These findings suggested that Eps8 was involved in the regulation of growth and motility of cancer cells and mithramycin might exert its anticancer ability via a pathway involving the downregulation of Eps8.
During the past years, angioedema occurring in association with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is seen more and more often. This is due to the increasing use of these drugs for hypertension and congestive heart failure. If the diagnosis is missed and prescription of the ACE inhibitor is prolonged, recurrent and more severe episodes of angioedema may occur. In case of involvement of the upper airway and respiratory distress, the condition may be life-threatening. We demonstrate three such patients, men of 84, 73 and 63 years old. First of all, the airway should be secured. Administration of epinephrine may be indicated. Further use of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated.
A 67-year-old male patient, with a history of palmar psoriasis for 8 years, developed a rosacea-like eruption during Tigason (Ro-10-9359) treatment. Strict relationship between Tigason intake and skin symptoms was proved by double introduction of the drug and the patient's previous history. This retinoid side effect is very unusual and we are unable to give any explanation for it.
In response to stress signals, postnatal cardiomyocytes undergo hypertrophic growth accompanied by activation of a fetal gene program, assembly of sarcomeres, and cellular enlargement. We show that hypertrophic signals stimulate the expression and transcriptional activity of myocardin, a cardiac and smooth muscle-specific coactivator of serum response factor (SRF). Consistent with a role for myocardin as a transducer of hypertrophic signals, forced expression of myocardin in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to substitute for hypertrophic signals and induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and the fetal cardiac gene program. Conversely, a dominant-negative mutant form of myocardin, which retains the ability to associate with SRF but is defective in transcriptional activation, blocks cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by hypertrophic agonists such as phenylephrine and leukemia inhibitory factor. Myocardin-dependent hypertrophy can also be partially repressed by histone deacetylase 5, a transcriptional repressor of myocardin. These findings identify myocardin as a nuclear effector of hypertrophic signaling pathways that couples stress signals to a transcriptional program for postnatal cardiac growth and remodeling.
Safety of combined hemodilution and isoflurane-induced hypotension was assessed by studying their effects on splanchnic hemodynamics and oxygenation in nine anesthetized (ketamine/flunitrazepam) pigs. Acute normovolemic hemodilution (decrease in hematocrit from 29% to 15%) with 6% hydroxyethyl starch decreased (P < 0.05) O2 delivery despite increases in cardiac output and all splanchnic flows, as measured by electromagnetic flow probes. Superimposed isoflurane (1.45% end-tidal concentrations) caused marked decreases in arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and splanchnic flows. Oxygen uptake of the liver became O2 supply dependent. A liver surface PO2 histogram (Clark-type electrode) showed 38% of PO2 values between 0 and 5 mm Hg. Hepatic lactate uptake decreased by 75%. These data suggest that depression of cardiovascular function during reduced O2-carrying capacity adversely affects hepatic perfusion, oxygenation, and function. Combined hemodilution and isoflurane-induced hypotension may not be appropriate in patients.
