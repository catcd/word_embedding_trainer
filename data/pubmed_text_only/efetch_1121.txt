Studies were performed to determine if early treatment with an angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan, prevents the onset of microalbuminuria by attenuating glomerular podocyte injury in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
OLETF rats were treated with either a vehicle, olmesartan (10 mg/kg/day) or a combination of nonspecific vasodilators (hydralazine 15 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 6 mg/kg/day, and reserpine 0.3 mg/kg/day; HHR) from the age of 7-25 weeks.
OLETF rats were hypertensive and had microalbuminuria from 9 weeks of age. At 15 weeks, OLETF rats had higher Ang II levels in the kidney, larger glomerular desmin-staining areas (an index of podocyte injury), and lower gene expression of nephrin in juxtamedullary glomeruli, than nondiabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats. At 25 weeks, OLETF rats showed overt albuminuria, and higher levels of Ang II in the kidney and larger glomerular desmin-staining areas in superficial and juxtamedullary glomeruli compared to LETO rats. Reductions in mRNA levels of nephrin were also observed in superficial and juxtamedullary glomeruli. Although olmesartan did not affect glucose metabolism, it decreased blood pressure and prevented the renal changes in OLETF rats. HHR treatment also reduced blood pressure, but did not affect the renal parameters.
This study demonstrated that podocyte injury occurs in juxtamedullary glomeruli prior to superficial glomeruli in type 2 diabetic rats with microalbuminuria. Early treatment with an ARB may prevent the onset of albuminuria through its protective effects on juxtamedullary glomerular podocytes.
We investigate whether symptoms of pressure, tightness, and/or pain in the chest, neck, and/or throat after administration of the 5HT1B/1D agonist avitriptan were associated with objective impairment of the myocardial function on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring, and echocardiography. Migraine sufferers who in two-thirds of all attacks treated with sumatriptan had experienced chest/throat/neck symptoms were chosen for study. Baseline measures included vital signs, a 12-lead ECG and an echocardiogram. Patients (n = 51) who had no clinically significant abnormality at baseline received a high dose (150 mg) of avitriptan orally outside of a migraine attack. If pressure, tightness, and/or pain in the chest, neck, and/or throat occurred, an ECG was obtained, and a repeat echocardiogram was done while the symptoms were present in order to monitor for impairment of myocardial function. If symptoms of these types did not occur within 60 min after administration of the study drug, a second echocardiogram was obtained. Forty-five patients (88%) reported at least one adverse event and 23 (45%) experienced pressure, tightness, and/or pain in the chest, neck, and/or throat after administration of avitriptan. No clinically significant myocardial abnormalities were observed in any patients, even in those who had experienced the targeted symptoms. No other serious adverse event occurred. We concluded that the typical 5HT1B/1D agonist-induced chest/throat/neck symptoms are most unlikely to be of cardiovascular origin.
Fifty-five patients undergoing hip arthroplasty under spinal anaesthesia (4 ml of 0.5% plain bupivacaine) were randomized to receive post-operative analgesia either using an intrathecal or an epidural catheter. Associated technical problems and side effects were studied. In both groups per-operative analgesia was achieved with intrathecal 0.5% plain bupivacaine, 4 ml. In the intrathecal infusion group a bolus dose of 100 micrograms morphine was injected through a spinal 28 gauge catheter followed by a 24 h infusion of 200 micrograms morphine (8.3 micrograms h-1). In the epidural infusion group a bolus dose of 2 mg of morphine was injected before the epidural 24 h infusion was started (morphine 200 micrograms h-1 + 0.25% bupivacaine 4 ml h-1). There were 10 catheter failures (two could not be inserted) in the intrathecal group and one in the epidural group. Three epidural catheter infusions failed due to other technical problems. The number of side effects was 21 in the remaining spinal group (n = 20) and 18 in the 20 epidural group patients with successful infusions. One patient in the spinal catheter group developed postdural puncture headache. For post-operative pain relief the patients in the epidural group needed less supplementary intramuscular oxycodone (five doses/four patients) than the spinal group (17 doses/nine patients) (P < 0.05).
To determine whether magnesium-aluminum-hydroxide-simethicone suspension (MgAl) is an effective treatment for dermal capsaicin exposures.
The authors performed a double-blind, randomized, controlled, pilot study comparing the effect of MgAl with that of saline in the treatment of dermal capsaicin exposures. Ten volunteers were sprayed with a commercial defensive spray containing 10% capsaicin on the flexor surface of both forearms. A dressing embedded with MgAl (Maalox) suspension was randomly applied to one arm and a saline-embedded dressing was applied to the other arm. Pain was assessed on a 10-cm visual analog scale at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.
Mean pain scores were significantly lower in the MgAl group as compared with the saline (S) group at 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Differences in pain scores were not statistically significant at times 60, 90, and 120 minutes.
During the initial 30 minutes of treatment, there was a statistically significant decrease in pain scores with MgAl as compared with saline treatments. Although the difference in means may have questionable clinical significance, MgAl is cheap and readily available, and has minimal side effects. Thus, MgAl may be an appropriate treatment for dermal capsaicin exposure.
Of 4 patients with cocaine-induced multifocal tics, 2 had Tourette's syndrome and had a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. One of these 2 patients experienced the exacerbation following her 1st exposure to the drug; the 2nd, a habitual cocaine snorter, after smoking "crack" for the 1st time. The other 2 patients were habitual cocaine abusers who, following a binge with high doses of cocaine, experienced new-onset tics.
L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa)-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease patients is characterized by a mixture of chorea and dystonia. Electrophysiological studies suggest that chorea is associated with abnormal synchronization of firing of basal ganglia neurons while dystonia is not. Levetiracetam is a novel anti-epileptic drug known to exhibit unique desynchronizing properties in contrast to other anti-epileptic drugs. We assessed the anti-dyskinetic efficacy of levetiracetam (13, 30 and 60 mg/kg, p.o.) administered in combination with an individually tailored dose of levodopa (Levodopa/carbidopa, 4:1 ratio, 19+/-1.8 mg/kg, p.o.), in six dyskinetic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned macaques. Levetiracetam (60 mg/kg) significantly reduced levodopa-induced chorea during the first hour post-treatment but had no effect on dystonia. Levetiracetam, at all doses tested, had no effect on the anti-parkinsonian action of levodopa. These results suggest that levetiracetam may provide a novel therapeutic approach specifically aimed at the choreic form of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.
Since patients exhibit both acute and chronic cardiac toxic effects from Adriamycin, the salient characteristics of the reported animal models for both acute and chronic cardiotoxicity are reviewed. This review reveals that while the pathology of these models is often well-characterized, the physiologic, biochemical, and nutritional variables are, in general, poorly defined.
A 45-year-old man with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis were referred to our hospital for treatment. We started chemotherapy with cycloserine (CS), ethionamide (TH), kanamycin (KM), pyrazinamide (PZA), para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and gatifloxacin (GFLX). Two months later, psychosis and seizure occurred and worsened day after day. We suspected that these symptoms were due to CS. After stopping CS, psychosis and seizure disappeared. After surgical operation, positive tubercle bacilli in sputum converted to negative both on smear and culture. He was successfully discharged from our hospital. We should take care on side effects with second-line drugs that are often used in treating multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
In a randomized (2:1), double-blinded design study, we studied 25 patients with congestive heart failure (66 +/- 9 years, ejection fraction 30 +/- 7%) before and after 23-week treatment with the beta blocker carvedilol 25 mg twice daily (n = 17) or placebo (n = 8) in addition to standard therapy. Using dynamic positron emission tomography, myocardial perfusion at rest and perfusion reserve after dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg/min) were measured. Myocardial glucose uptake and plasma levels of catecholamines were also estimated. Carvedilol treatment reduced the rate-pressure product (8,781 +/- 2,672 vs 6,342 +/- 1,346, p <0.01) and improved ejection fraction (29 +/- 7% vs 37 +/- 11%, p <0.001), whereas no changes were observed in the control group. Perfusion at rest was unchanged in the placebo group (0.81 +/- 0.17 vs 0.86 +/- 0.23 ml/g/min, p = NS), whereas the carvedilol-treated group showed a significant reduction (0.88 +/- 0.26 vs 0.75 +/- 0.16 ml/g/min, p <0.05). Dipyridamole-induced hyperemia was significantly reduced after carvedilol treatment (1.51 +/- 0.45 vs 1.31 +/- 0.51 ml/g/min, p <0.001), whereas myocardial perfusion reserve was unaltered. Carvedilol did not alter myocardial glucose uptake (0.33 +/- 0.14 vs 0.32 +/- 0.12 micromol/g/min, p = NS) or the plasma catecholamines levels. We therefore conclude that in patients with congestive heart failure, carvedilol reduced resting and hyperemic perfusion. No effect on glucose uptake or catecholamine levels was observed. The reduced perfusion at rest must reflect reduced perfusion demand and thereby a higher threshold for myocardial ischemia and protection against myocardial damage or malignant arrhythmia. These effects may serve as a pathophysiologic explanation for the reduced mortality in patients with congestive heart failure who receive carvedilol.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonists, clofibrate and WY14643 on the renal dysfunction and injury caused by bilateral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of rat kidneys in vivo.
Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with sodium thiopentone (120 mg/kg i.v.) and subjected to bilateral renal ischemia (45 min) followed by reperfusion (6 h). Serum and urinary biochemical indicators of renal dysfunction and injury were measured; serum creatinine (sCr, glomerular dysfunction), fractional excretion of Na+ (FENa, tubular dysfunction), and urinary N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase (uNAG, tubular injury). Additionally, renal sections were used for histological grading of renal injury and for RT-PCR analysis of the expression of PPAR-isoforms in kidneys obtained from rats prior to or after I/R. In addition, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was determined using Northern blot analysis.
Using RT-PCR, we document here the expression of PPAR-alpha, PPAR-beta and PPAR-gamma1 (but not PPAR-gamma2) in the kidney of the rat. I/R resulted in the down-regulation of PPAR-alpha without modulation of any other PPAR. Clofibrate and WY14643 significantly reduced the increases in sCr, FENa and uNAG caused by renal I/R, indicating attenuation of renal dysfunction and injury. Expression of ICAM-1 caused by I/R of the kidney was not modulated by PPAR-alpha agonists.
We show here that (i) renal I/R results in the down-regulation of PPAR-alpha in the kidney, and (ii) that the PPAR-alpha agonists clofibrate and WY14643 reduce the renal dysfunction and injury associated with I/R of the kidney.
The systemic treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has produced disappointing results thus far. HCC is a hypervascular tumor with over-expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor. Thalidomide is an anti-neoplastic agent with anti-angiogenic and other mechanisms of action. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of low-dose (100 mg) thalidomide as the first-line treatment of advanced HCC.
Between August 2003 and March 2007, 45 patients who had received thalidomide 100 mg daily as first-line treatment of advanced HCC were reviewed retrospectively. Advanced HCC was defined as either metastatic or not amenable to surgical or locoregional therapies. Diagnosis of HCC was based on clinical, biochemical and radiological grounds. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Thirty-eight patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Two (5%) patients had partial response and 8 (21%) had stable disease. The overall median survival of patients in this cohort was 3.2 months (95% CI: 2.8-3.7 months). The common toxicities were somnolence (13%), peripheral neuropathy (11%) and ankle edema (8%), with no grade 3 or 4 toxicities and treatment-related deaths.
Our study shows that a single agent, low-dose thalidomide has a modest clinical activity with good tolerability in treating advanced HCC patients.
The effect of oral dissolution therapy for pancreatic stones was evaluated in patients with chronic calcific pancreatitis. The anti-epileptic agent trimethadione was given orally to 30 outpatients at a dose of 0.9-1.5 g daily. On plain X-ray films and CT scans of the abdomen, pancreatic stones began to be dissolved around 8 months of treatment, and diminished in size and number or disappeared in 21 patients (70%) during the mean follow-up period of 32 months. The effect of trimethadione treatment on dissolution of stones was not closely related to the aetiology of the disease, distribution and size of stones, previous history of surgical interventions, or the degree of pancreatic dysfunctions. In three patients who stopped this medication of their own accord, pancreatic stones re-increased or reappeared about 6 months later. During trimethadione treatment, impaired exocrine pancreatic function returned to normal in four of nine patients examined, and diabetes mellitus was well controlled by either diet therapy alone or oral hypoglycaemic agents in eight of 10 patients who did not need insulin before trimethadione treatment. Complete relief of pain was noted in 73% of patients during the treatment. Overall gains and no change in bodyweight were observed in 83% of patients. Mild photophobia was the most common side effect, but could be easily overcome by wearing sunglasses. No severe side effects were observed in the liver, kidney, blood or the eyeground. Pancreatic stones in 30 patients not treated with trimethadione neither disappeared nor diminished spontaneously. Trimethadione treatment may be a useful tool for chemical dissolution of pancreatic stones.
We report 2 patients over the age of 70 who, while on valproate (VPA) for complex partial seizures, developed sensorineural hearing loss. Following discontinuation of VPA for nonaudiologic reasons, the patients reported improved hearing which was confirmed by audiometry. These findings represent VPA-induced sensorineural hearing loss, possibly in preexisting presbycusis.
We report a 13-year-old male patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2 who developed severe neuropathy because of vincristine (VCR) for his acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A clumsy gait, muscle weakness in his fingers, and inverted champagne bottlelike muscle in the lower limbs were noticed after remission induction treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which included VCR at a total dose of 8 mg/m. An electrophysiologic study showed an almost normal median motor nerve conduction velocity (approximately 50 m/s), markedly reduced M-wave amplitude and sensory disturbance. He was diagnosed as CMT type 2 based on his symptoms and electrophysiologic findings. His symptoms gradually worsened, and even after VCR was discontinued, he could not walk alone for 7 months. VCR has previously been considered to be relatively safe in CMT type 2, however, some patients with CMT type 2 might show severe neurologic toxicities, as seen in patients with CMT type 1.
Cirrhosis of the rat liver was induced by a 12 week individualized CCl4/phenobarbital treatment. After treatment, all surviving animals (81%) showed cirrhosis of the liver. The cirrhosis induced was irreversible when evaluated 24 weeks after cessation of treatment. Quantitative liver function measurements were reduced in a differentiated manner. Ranked according to the most pronounced changes they are: capacity of urea-N synthesis (CUNS), galactose elimination capacity (GEC) and antipyrine clearance (APC). Hepatic glutathione concentrations were only slightly decreased after the CCl4 treatment. It is possible to produce a high incidence of irreversible cirrhosis with differentiated functional impairment in the rat.
Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, alters several physiological processes, for example, elevating intracellular cAMP level, in the hippocampus. We examined the effect of fluoxetine on ischemia-induced neuronal death, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and changes in some antioxidative enzymes in the hippocampal CA1 region induced by transient ischemia. In addition, we also studied the effect of fluoxetine on locomotor activity in gerbils after ischemia/reperfusion. Animals were administered with various doses of fluoxetine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 3 days before the ischemic surgery. The treatment of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg fluoxetine did not show significant neuroprotective effects on CA1 pyramidal cells 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion, while the treatment with 40 mg/kg fluoxetine in ischemic animals showed about 77% neuronal survival rate compared to the control group. The treatment of 40 mg/kg fluoxetine in ischemic animals enhanced significantly BDNF, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) immunoreactivity in the CA1 region compared to those in the saline-treated group 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, the treatment of fluoxetine (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) significantly inhibited post-ischemic hyperactivity. In brief, treatment with fluoxetine protects neuronal damage after transient ischemia, and the neuroprotective effect of fluoxetine in an ischemic animal model may be related with the up-regulation of BDNF, CAT, GPX, and SOD1 expression.
There are lingering concerns about caffeine consumption during pregnancy or the early postnatal period, partly because there may be long-lasting behavioral changes after caffeine exposure early in life.
We show that pregnant wild type (WT) mice given modest doses of caffeine (0.3 g/l in drinking water) gave birth to offspring that as adults exhibited increased locomotor activity in an open field. The offspring also responded to cocaine challenge with greater locomotor activity than mice not perinatally exposed to caffeine. We performed the same behavioral experiments on mice heterozygous for adenosine A(1) receptor gene (A(1)RHz). In these mice signaling via adenosine A(1) receptors is reduced to about the same degree as after modest consumption of caffeine. A(1)RHz mice had a behavioral profile similar to WT mice perinatally exposed to caffeine. Furthermore, it appeared that the mother's genotype, not offspring's, was critical for behavioral changes in adult offspring. Thus, if the mother partially lacked A(1) receptors the offspring displayed more hyperactivity and responded more strongly to cocaine stimulation as adults than did mice of a WT mother, regardless of their genotype. This indicates that long-term behavioral alterations in the offspring result from the maternal effect of caffeine, and not a direct effect on fetus. WT offspring from WT mother but having a A(1)R Hz grandmother preserved higher locomotor response to cocaine.
We suggest that perinatal caffeine, by acting on adenosine A(1) receptors in the mother, causes long-lasting behavioral changes in the offspring that even manifest themselves in the second generation.
High-glucose/low-dose insulin-mediated insulin resistance of glucose transport was studied in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In this model, proximal insulin signaling, including insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1-bound phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activation, is preserved, but insulin-stimulated protein kinase B (Akt) activation is markedly impaired. To assess a difference in acute insulin-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3], cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and glycerophosphoinositides were quantified by HPLC. Although basal PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was similar, insulin stimulated its production 33.6% more in controls (P < 0.03) than in insulin-resistant cells. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein, a lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the 3-position, was significantly and specifically increased in insulin-resistant cells. Treatment with rapamycin [a specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)] inhibited the increased PTEN expression and partially restored insulin-stimulated glucose transport and Akt activation to insulin-resistant cells. Acute insulin markedly stimulated Ser(636/639) phosphorylation of IRS-1; this was rapamycin inhibited but was significantly decreased in cells that had been preexposed to insulin, whereas total IRS-1 was unaffected. These findings were essentially paralleled by changes in the activation of p70 S6 kinase and S6-ribosomal protein. Overexpression of uncoupling protein-1 or manganese superoxide dismutase did not prevent the development of insulin-resistant glucose transport and impaired Akt activation in high-glucose/low-insulin-pretreated cells. The insulin resistance associated with glucotoxicity in our model reflects in part decreased availability of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which correlates with increased PTEN protein expression. Chronic activation of mTORC1 plays a role in stimulating PTEN expression and possibly in activation or induction of a phosphoprotein phosphatase. No evidence was found for a role for increased mitochondrial superoxide production in this model.
Refractory sprue is a rare and severe malabsorptive disorder that mimics celiac disease but is refractory to a gluten-free diet and is without initial evidence of overt lymphoma. Treatment is largely empiric and often ineffective, with steroids and immunosuppression being the mainstream therapeutic options. The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the effect of azathioprine on a group of patients diagnosed with refractory sprue.
We studied seven consecutive patients (five women and two men) with a well-defined diagnosis of refractory sprue and a lack of response to oral or parenteral steroids. At diagnosis, five patients had endoscopic evidence of ulcerative jejunitis, and five underwent exploratory laparotomy for exclusion of malignancies. The characteristic monoclonal TCRgamma gene rearrangement was shown in five of six patients studied. Patients were treated for a mean of 11 months (range 8-12 months), and clinical, biochemical, molecular, and histological parameters were reassessed at the end of the trial. The study was a prospective, open-label, non-placebo-controlled study using azathioprine (2 mg/kg/ day) plus oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). A gluten-free diet (n = 7) as well as enteral (n = 6) and parenteral nutrition (n = 5) were administered during the trial.
After treatment, five patients had a complete clinical remission, and biochemical and nutritional parameters were significantly improved. Steroids were tapered after the onset of azathioprine, and no patient was on steroids at the end of the trial. Intestinal histology improved significantly in all cases (normal histology in three cases and minor infiltration in the lamina propria in two). Two patients did not respond to treatment at any time and died in months 10 and 9, of an irreversible ventricular fibrillation and sepsis, respectively. No overt lymphoma was demonstrated during the follow-up.
The present study confirms earlier anecdotal reports on the efficacy of azathioprine in refractory sprue, with clear clinical and histological improvement shown in most patients. However, monoclonality persisted after treatment. We consider that a larger number of patients should be evaluated before a definitive recommendation is adopted for use of this drug in refractory sprue.
Disturbances in serotonin (5HT) neurotransmission have been indicated as biological substrates in several neuropsychiatric disorders including autism. Blood 5HT concentrations, elevated in about one-third of autistic subjects, are regulated through the action of peripheral 5HT-associated proteins. We have measured the activity of two platelet 5HT-associated proteins: 5HT transporter (5HTT) and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), and indirectly studied the activity of 5HT(2A) receptor (5HT(2A)r) in 15 hyperserotonemic (HS) and 17 normoserotonemic (NS) autistic subjects, and 15 healthy controls (C). While mean velocities of 5HTT kinetics did not significantly differ among the groups, significant elevation in the mean velocity of MAOB kinetics was observed in NS subjects and was even more pronounced in HS subjects in comparison to controls. Also, a decrease in adenosine 5'-diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation of borderline significance was observed in NS subjects, compared to C subjects. The results suggest a possibility of upregulation of monoaminergic synthesis/degradation and, probably consequential, downregulation of 5HT(2A)r in autistic subjects.
The authors determined the incidence of ibuprofen-associated renal impairment and risk factors for its development in 1908 patients treated with ibuprofen using data from a computerized medical records system. Renal impairment occurred in 343 patients (18%). Multivariable analysis revealed six independent predictors of renal impairment: age, prior renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, male gender, elevated systolic blood pressure, and diuretic use. They then tested the degree to which ibuprofen contributed to the development of renal impairment by evaluating a control group of 3933 acetaminophen recipients. Neither ibuprofen nor acetaminophen was among the independent predictors of risk when all patients were considered (adjusted odds ratio, 1.05; 95% Cl, 0.88-1.26). However, two subsets of at risk patients had an ibuprofen effect: patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age who received ibuprofen were at greater risk of renal impairment as compared to acetaminophen recipients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% Cl, 1.05 to 1.72) as were patients with coronary artery disease (adjusted odds ratio, 2.54; 95% Cl, 1.38 to 4.68). Their results suggest that elderly patients and patients with coronary artery disease are at risk for ibuprofen-associated renal impairment and therefore should have their renal function monitored when ibuprofen and possibly other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed.
Deficiency of minerals causes functional abnormality of enzymes, frequently resulting in metabolic disturbance. We investigated possible relationship between minerals and metabolic syndrome by analysis of hair tissue minerals. We selected 848 subjects older than 20 years of age at Ajou University Hospital from May 2004 to February 2007. We excluded the subjects who had cancers, steroid and thyroid medication, and incomplete record from the study. Finally, 343 subjects were eligible. We performed cross-sectional analysis for the relationship between minerals and metabolic syndrome. The contents of calcium, magnesium, and copper in the metabolic syndrome group were significantly lower than those of the normal group, whereas the amounts of sodium, potassium, and mercury in the metabolic syndrome group were significantly higher than those of the normal group. By dividing the subjects into quartile with the level of calcium, magnesium, and mercury concentrations, we carried out logistic regression analysis to study the subjects and found that the subjects in the third quartile of calcium and magnesium concentrations had significantly lower odds ratio (OR) of the metabolic syndrome compared with that of the lowest quartile group [OR = 0.30, confidence interval (CI) = 0.10-0.89; OR = 0.189, CI = 0.063-0.566] and that the subjects in the highest mercury quartile had significantly higher OR of the metabolic syndrome compared with that of the lowest mercury quartile group (OR = 7.35, CI = 1.73-31.1). As part of the metabolic syndrome, the optimal calcium and magnesium concentrations in hair tissue may reflect decreased risk of metabolic syndrome, whereas high mercury concentration in hair tissue may indicate increased risk of metabolic syndrome.
The present study was undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson's disease in rats. 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson's disease rat model involves chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, and the loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the predominant lesion. Resveratrol has been shown to have anti-inflammatory actions, and thus was tested for its beneficial effects using 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson's disease rat model. Adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were unilaterally injected with 6-OHDA (5 microg/2 microl) into the right striatum, and the striatum damage was assessed by rotational test, ultrahistopathology, and molecular alterations. Resveratrol (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) was then given orally to Parkinson's disease rats, daily for 10 weeks to examine the protective effects. Rotational test (turns of rats) showed that resveratrol significantly attenuated apomorphine-induced turns of rats in 6-OHDA-injuried Parkinson's disease rat model as early as two weeks of administration. Ultrastructural analysis showed that resveratrol alleviated 6-OHDA-induced chromatin condensation, mitochondrial tumefaction and vacuolization of dopaminergic neurons in rat substantia nigra. Furthermore, resveratrol treatment also significantly decreased the levels of COX-2 and TNF-alpha mRNA in the substantia nigra as detected by real-time RT-PCR. COX-2 protein expression in the substantia nigra was also decreased as evidenced by Western blotting. These results demonstrate that resveratrol exerts a neuroprotective effect on 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson's disease rat model, and this protection is related to the reduced inflammatory reaction.
Keshan disease (KD) is a fatal dilated cardiomyopathy with unknown etiology. We studied the gene-environment interaction in the pathogenesis of KD by assessing the association of low blood selenium and polymorphisms in glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) gene.
The concentration of blood selenium and the activity and polymorphisms of GPx-1 in 71KD patients and 290 controls were measured. The functions of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes resulting from overexpression of 2 variants of GPx-1 were studied.
Blood concentration of selenium and GPx-1 activity were lower in patients than in controls. Genetic analysis revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (Pro198Leu) in GPx-1 gene associated with selenium deficiency as well as impaired GPx-1 activity. Gene-environment interaction analysis revealed a synergistic-multiplicative interaction between polymorphism of GPx-1 and selenium deficiency. Overexpression of the GPx-1 leucine-containing allele in cultured cardiomyocytes caused a 30% reduction in selenium-induced GPx-1 activity and increased serum starvation induced apoptosis as compared with that of the wild-type variant 198Pro.
Selenium deficiency in carriers with the GPx-1 leucine-containing allele is associated with low GPx-1 enzyme activity, which may, in turn, increase the incidence of KD. Results from this unique disease may have broad implications for a gene-environment reaction in the etiology of other diseases.
