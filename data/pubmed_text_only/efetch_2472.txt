Blood pressure was studied at rest, continuously for 24 h and during dynamic and isometric exercise in previously untreated males with documented mild hypertension. The antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol was compared with that of enalapril in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, in order to elucidate whether or not these more comprehensive measurements could better distinguish between the efficacy of the drugs than office recordings made at rest. Atenolol proved more effective than enalapril in reducing diastolic blood pressure at rest (P less than 0.05), and systolic blood pressure during dynamic exercise (P less than 0.001), but in the 24-h ambulatory study there were no differences in effectiveness between the drugs. Several patients did not attain our pre-set diastolic treatment goal at rest (less than or equal to 90 mmHg) on single-drug therapy, thus indicating a need for supplementary treatment. When blood pressure was analysed over 24 h, however, there were few recordings greater than 90 mmHg, and the need for supplementary treatment appeared less obvious. Therefore, more comprehensive blood pressure measurements should be considered in the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment.
A 28-year-old male developed total external ophthalmoplegia following oral administration of phenytoin. The case is reported and its significance is discussed.
The hemodynamic effects of clonidine were studied in four patients with sever idiopathic orthostatic hypotension and one patient with baroreceptor dysfunction. No depressor response to clonidine was observed in any patient with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension at any dosage. Rather, two patients responded to 0.4 mg of oral clonidine with a 40 mm Hg increment in systolic blood pressure lasting several hours. Each has been receiving clonidine, 0.4 mg twice daily, for one year with greatly increased functional capacity. The other two patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension had an even greater pressor response to 0.8 mg of oral clonidine, but adverse effects prevented continued therapeutic use. In marked contrast, the patient with baroreceptor dysfunction had a profound depressor response to 0.2 mg of clonidine. In the treatment of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, the major advantage of clonidine over other pressor agents is its longer duration of action. The major adverse effects of the drug in these patients are sedation, dry mouth, altered mentation, and excessive hypertension. The drug should not be given to patients with mild idiopathic orthostatic hypotension or selective baroreceptor dysfunction, since severe hypotension may result.
A treatment-resistant depressed patient developed bipolar rapid cycling in response to pindolol augmentation of paroxetine, after failing to respond in any fashion to pindolol added to desipramine. The rapid cycling initially faded, but recurred after the pindolol dose was increased (in combination with paroxetine) in an attempt to treat a relapse into depression. Her differential development of rapid cycling with pindolol in combination with the SSRI is in keeping with the theory that pindolol augmentation operates via a serotonergic mechanism.
A 38-year-old woman with thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, presumed to be secondary to the use of the oral contraceptive pill, is reported. The use of cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance imaging in establishing the diagnosis and management strategies is discussed. It is concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is an appropriate investigative modality for diagnosis and therapeutic decision making, and that, as with superficial cerebral dural sinus and venous thrombosis, anticoagulation is a safe and effective therapy.
Recently, it was reported that exogenous bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 acted as an antiproliferative agent in a variety of cell lines, including normal and cancerous gastric cell lines, indicating that BMP-2 plays an important role during cell growth. However, despite the loss of BMP-2 expression in several cancers, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Epigenetic silencing through DNA methylation is one of the key steps during carcinogenesis. In this study, we found, through analysis by the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction technique, CpG island methylation of the BMP-2 promoter region in gastric and colon cancer cell lines. BMP-2 mRNA was found to be activated after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of the methylation-positive cells. Moreover, 24 of the 56 (42.9%) gastric cancer tissues exhibited promoter methylation. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that 18 of the 24 (75%) gastric cancer tissues without methylation signals exhibited BMP-2 expression, whereas among 20 cancer tissues with strong methylation signals only four (20%) expressed BMP-2 (P = 0.0003). These findings indicate that BMP-2 methylation is strongly associated with the loss of BMP-2 protein expression in the primary gastric carcinomas. BMP-2 methylation was more often observed in diffuse type (60.7%) than in intestinal type (25%) gastric carcinomas (P = 0.007). Thus, aberrant BMP-2 methylation and the resultant loss of BMP-2 expression may be related to gastric carcinogenesis, particularly in the diffuse type.
Lindane and endosulfan are chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides that bind to the gamma-aminobutyric-acidA (GABAA) receptor ionophore complex. We have previously demonstrated development of a persistent predisposition to the seizure-inducing properties of these pesticides following repeated administration of initially subconvulsive doses. A subsequent facilitation of electrical kindling development indicated that a chemical kindling mechanism may contribute to this enhanced sensitivity. We tested the bidirectionality of kindling transfer induced by chemical and electrical means by comparing the convulsive thresholds of lindane and endosulfan in electrically kindled and nonkindled animals. Amygdala kindled, implanted/nonstimulated, and nonimplanted controls were administered 0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg of lindane or endosulfan in corn oil by gavage, and each animal's behavior was scored for the presence of myoclonic jerks (MCJ) and clonic seizures. Dose-related increases in the number of animals displaying convulsions in response to both of these pesticides were observed. The dose of lindane (4.5 mg/kg) and endosulfan (4.3 mg/kg) producing MCJs in 50% of the animals (ED50) was reduced by more than 60% in kindled animals relative to controls. A second experiment evaluated the generalized seizure threshold in previously kindled animals treated with low doses of endosulfan (0, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg, po by gavage). Endosulfan reduced the intensity of electrical stimulation required to evoke seizures in amygdala kindled animals. These data indicate that these chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides reduce seizure thresholds in amygdala-kindled animals with acute administration, and together with previous findings (see ref. 20) demonstrate bidirectional transfer between chemical and electrical kindling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The identification of DNA sequence variants underlying human complex phenotypes remains a significant challenge for several reasons: individual variants can have small phenotypic effects or low population frequencies, and multiple allelic variants may act in concert to affect a trait. We evaluated the combined effect of allelic variants in seven genes involved in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, using forward stepwise regression. Analysis of all known common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the seven candidate genes revealed four variants that were associated with incremental changes in HDL cholesterol levels in three independent samples. Conversely, analysis of 660 polymorphisms in eight genes that do not appear to be involved in HDL metabolism did not identify any associations with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. These data indicate that several common SNPs act in concert to influence plasma levels of HDL cholesterol.
Tiazofurin, an investigational antimetabolite, is undergoing clinical evaluation in leukemia. We analyzed the data base of 198 patients entered in Phase I trials to characterize the incidence and severity of toxicities associated with tiazofurin according to dose and schedule. Severe myelosuppression occurred infrequently, and was not dose-dependent. A five day bolus schedule had a higher incidence of severe or life-threatening neutropenia than other schedules. Tiazofurin produced lymphopenia which was not dose-dependent in the range of 23-36% decrease from baseline, and the effect on lymphocyte count was generally greater than the decline in neutrophil count. Non-hematologic toxicity of a moderate or worse severity (greater than or equal to grade 2) included nausea and vomiting (18% of all courses), serum transaminase elevations (SGOT, 16%; SGPT, 9%), rash (9%), stomatitis (3%), conjunctivitis (3%), headache (10%), other signs of central nervous system toxicity (8%), and cardiac toxicity, primarily pleuropericarditis (4%). Dose-related cutaneous toxicity, headache, and nausea and vomiting were evident in the five day bolus schedule, and myalgia was more frequently reported at higher doses on the single dose schedule. The five day continuous infusion (CI) schedule had a higher incidence of neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, SGPT elevations and ocular toxicity than the daily for five days bolus schedule, but none of these differences attained statistical significance. Although the peak plasma concentrations of tiazofurin achieved with the five day bolus schedule were 3-fold higher than the steady-state plasma levels seen with an equal dose given by CI, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was approximately 1.6-fold higher with CI. These observations suggest that both high peak plasma concentrations (above 400 microM) and prolonged exposure to plasma levels exceeding 50 microM may result in a higher incidence of serious non-hematologic toxicity.
A 39-year-old man with a history of frequent "crack" cocaine use of several years' duration presented with progressive dyspnea. Evaluation revealed bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates and hilar adenopathy, diffuse pulmonary uptake of gallium, and markedly elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Open lung biopsy revealed interstitial and perivascular collections of histiocytes containing refractile, polarizable material, presumably inhaled along with the cocaine. Paratracheal lymph nodes were enlarged, reactive, and contained similar polarizable material. The well-formed, non-necrotizing granulomata characteristic of sarcoidosis were not present in either tissue specimen. To our knowledge, the association of chronic crack cocaine inhalation with this constellation of clinical findings, typically seen in sarcoidosis, has not previously been described.
2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is a suspected human breast carcinogen found in cooked meat that induces mammary gland cancer in rats. By real time PCR analysis, PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinomas showed statistically higher expression of the G(1)-S cyclin D1 (5-fold) and its kinase partner cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-4 (37-fold) in comparison with normal mammary gland, whereas cyclin D2, cyclin D3, and Cdk6 were not statistically changed. Amplification of cyclin D1 was observed by real time PCR in 24% of carcinomas (15 of 63). Only 1 of 47 carcinomas showed Cdk4 amplification. By Western blotting, the level of phospho-Rb was >2-fold higher in carcinomas than in normal mammary gland. By immunohistochemical analysis, cyclin D1, Cdk4, and phospho-Rb nuclear protein expression was 5.7-, 3.9-, and 2.3-fold higher, respectively, in carcinomas than in normal mammary gland, whereas the expression of cyclin D2, cyclin D3, and Cdk6 was similar. Among carcinomas, Cdk4 and phospho-Rb levels were positively correlated with cell proliferation. Previous studies by this laboratory indicated that these carcinomas harbor a high frequency of H-ras mutations. The H-ras pathway is linked to the cell cycle via cyclin D1. The results from the current study implicate cyclin D1/Cdk4, phospho-Rb as a central pathway in PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinogenesis.
We report the case of an exuberant ulcerative angiomatoid nasal lesion in a cocaine abuser. The lesion was made up of polymorphous endothelial cells with occasional mitoses, arranged in a lobular pattern with infiltrative-looking areas. There were extensive areas of thrombosis with focal recanalization. Intravascular proliferation was not observed. The clinical, radiological, and histological features suggested hemangiosarcoma as the main differential diagnosis, but the lobular architecture of the lesion and the widespread thrombosis favoured the diagnosis of a benign reactive process.
Doses of 600 mg and 1200 mg of D(-)penicillamine daily were superior to a standard regimen of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. The higher dose did not produce significantly greater therapeutic benefit in the group of patients so treated, although individual patients sometimes improved more. The frequency of rashes, blood dyscrasias, and withdrawals from the trial increased withe dosage. It is concluded that D(-)penicillamine is a useful treatment that the daily dose should be as low as possible, and that it should be increased at infrequent intervals only, with due regard to the likelihood of further improvement in relation to an increased risk of adverse reactions.
Both the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) and ethanol interfere with fetal folate metabolism, which may contribute to their mechanism of teratogenesis. Therefore, the possible interaction between VPA and ethanol was investigated in mice. Ethanol (2 x 2.5 g/kg) was given orally 4 and 1 h prior to VPA (300 and 400 mg/kg, SC) in day 8.25 pregnant NMRI mice. Fetuses were examined for exencephaly, embryolethality, and fetal weight retardation on day 18 of gestation. Higher doses of ethanol (2 x 5 g/kg, orally) at day 7.5 and 8 of gestation resulted in 22% embryolethality and 1.7% exencephaly with no effect on fetal weight. Ethanol, however, increased VPA (400 mg/kg, SC)-induced exencephaly, embryolethality, and fetal weight retardation. It also increased VPA (300 mg/kg, SC)-induced exencephaly without affecting embryotoxicity. A minimum of two oral doses of 2.5 g/kg ethanol, 1 and 4 h, or 1 and 6 h prior to VPA administration were needed to produce maximum potentiation of the effects observed. These ethanol doses increased plasma VPA levels of day 8.25 pregnant mice given 400 mg/kg VPA to values comparable to the levels of mice given only VPA at a higher dose level (500 mg/kg). The incidence of exencephaly was increased from 35% for VPA (400 mg/kg) to 59% when VPA was given with ethanol. This incidence was similar to that of 60% for the high dose of VPA (500 mg/kg) administered without ethanol. Maternal plasma ethanol concentration peaked at 193, 196, and 183 mg/dL 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively, after oral ethanol administration (2.5 g/kg), and fell to 110 mg/dL by 2 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
We evaluated the efficacy of epirubicin in a phase II trial in breast cancer, as well as its cardiac toxicity. The study was carried out on 40 female patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent breast cancer. The patients were grouped into two groups: group I received 30 mg/m2 epirubicin weekly, and group II 90 mg/m2 epirubicin every 3 weeks. Cardiac monitoring was by ECG, roentgenography, echocardiography and endomyocardial biopsies. Clinical results were 35.3% overall response in group I, and 50% overall response in group II. No untoward cardiac toxicities were encountered. We conclude that epirubicin is an effective agent in breast cancer with relatively little cardiac toxicity.
A proline-rich Akt substrate (PRAS) contributes to the regulation of apoptosis after a variety of cell death stimuli, as well as in an in vivo transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI) model. We reported previously that overexpression of copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) reduces apoptotic cell death after tFCI. Our present study was designed to clarify the relationship between the PRAS signaling pathway and oxidative stress in the regulation of apoptosis after tFCI.
We used a tFCI model with SOD1 transgenic mice and wild-type littermates to examine the expression of phosphorylated PRAS (pPRAS) by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry and the interaction of pPRAS with phosphorylated Akt (pPRAS/pAkt) or the 14-3-3 protein (pPRAS/14-3-3) by coimmunoprecipitation. Direct oxidation of the carbonyl groups, an indication of oxidative injury to total and individual proteins caused by tFCI, was examined using a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone reaction assay.
Expression of pPRAS, pPRAS/pAkt, and pPRAS/14-3-3 decreased 2 hours after tFCI. Oxidized hydroethidine did not colocalize with expression of pPRAS. Individual oxidized carbonyls in pPRAS remarkably increased 2 hours after tFCI but were significantly reduced by SOD1 2 hours after tFCI. Expression of pPRAS, pPRAS/pAkt, and pPRAS/14-3-3 was promoted by SOD1 during the same time course.
These results suggest that overexpression of SOD1 may affect the PRAS pathway after tFCI by reducing the direct oxidative reaction to pPRAS after reperfusion injury.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, serves as an energy sensor in all eukaryotic cells. Recent findings suggest that AMPK activation strongly suppresses cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that chemopreventive agent curcumin strongly activates AMPK in a p38-dependent manner in CaOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Pretreatment of cells with compound C (AMPK inhibitor) and SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) attenuates curcumin-induced cell death. We also observed that curcumin induces p53 phosphorylation (Ser 15) and both compound C and SB203580 pretreatment inhibit p53 phosphorylation. Collectively, our data suggest that AMPK is a new molecular target of curcumin and AMPK activation partially contributes to the cytotoxic effect of curcumin in ovarian cancer cells.
Transluminal angioplasty with a balloon catheter is effective to dilate renal artery stenosis (RAS) caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), but lesions resistant to the angioplasty exist. In this report, we describe the case of a young woman with RAS of FMD that was difficult to dilate even by cutting-balloon angioplasty. To facilitate the formation of a smooth intimal covering at the site of angioplasty, we administered losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, for 4 months after the angioplasty. Although re-stenosis was detected at 5 months after the angioplasty, the normotensive state continued without antihypertensives and the re-stenosis gradually dilated afterwards. The present case suggests the possibility of remodeling the renal artery during the normotensive state by administering losartan after the angioplasty.
Cefotiam (CGP 14221/E; SCE 963), a semisynthetic cephalosporin, was administered as a single dose by i.v. injection to rats l(up to 1.8 g/kg body-weight) and rabbits (up to 1.7 g/kg body-weight). Cephaloridine served as positive control (1.0 and 0.75 g/kg in rats; 0.3 and 0.28 g/kg in rabbits). The animals were sacrificed 24 h after injection and the kidneys preserved for routine histology and enzyme histochemistry (alkaline phosphatase, aminopeptidase, succinate dehydrogenase, esterase). Serum samples (Na+, K+, Cl-, urea, creatinine, LDH, alkaline phosphatase) and 24-h urine (Na+, K+, Cl-, urea, creatinine, protein, LDH, aminopeptidase) were analysed before and 24 h after injection. Minimal, irregularly scattered, degenerative changes in the proximal tubules which were not dose-dependent in degree were observed in rat kidneys following cefotiam injection. A slight dose-dependent degeneration in up to 50% of proximal tubular cells with loss of brush-border membrane enzyme activity was observed in rabbit kidneys. In both animal species the ability to concentrate urine was retained and urea and creatinine serum levels hardly affected. Following cefotiam injection a dose-dependent 4-fold excretion of urinary protein but not of LDH was observed in rabbits only. By contrast, cephaloridine caused extensive degeneration and necrosis in up to 90% of proximal tubular cells in both rats and rabbits, which was accompanied with formation of enzymically active hyaline casts, loss of urine-concentrating capacity of the kidney, elevated serum levels of urea and creatinine and an increased urinary excretion of LDH (60-fold in rats, 20-fold in rabbits) and protein (3-fold in rats, 10-fold in rabbits). Histochemistry and electron microscopy of rabbit kidneys suggested a loss of microvilli from proximal tubule cells by endocytosis and thus degeneration following injection of large doses of cefotiam, whereas cell disruption and necrosis prevailed after cephaloridine. The action of cefotiam on the proximal tubule cells is, therefore, not only quantitatively but possibly also qualitatively different from that of cephaloridine. Semiquantitative evaluation of tubular injuries in alkaline phosphatase-stained kidney sections and measurements of LDH and protein content in 24-h urine samples were advantageous in determining the quantity and the quality of nephrotoxic effects.
Antiarrhythmic effects of (+)-cibenzoline and (-)-cibenzoline were examined using two canine ventricular arrhythmia models. Digitalis arrhythmia, which is suppressed by Na channel blockers, was induced by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) injection of ouabain in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Adrenaline arrhythmia, which is suppressed by Ca channel blockers, was induced by adrenaline infusion in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Ten and 5 mg/kg i.v. (+)-cibenzoline suppressed digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias, respectively. The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (+)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). A lower dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. of (-)-cibenzoline suppressed the digitalis-induced arrhythmia, whereas 5 mg/kg i.v. was needed to suppress adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (-)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmia were 0.06 +/- 0.04 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). The stronger antiarrhythmic effect of (-)-cibenzoline indicates that (-)-isomer may have an effect nearly 5-20 times stronger in suppressing Na channels, but effects of both drugs on Ca channels may be almost equipotent.
Galanthamine hydrobromide, an anticholinesterase drug capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, was used in a patient demonstrating central effects of scopolamine (hyoscine) overdosage. It is longer acting than physostigmine and is used in anaesthesia to reverse the non-depolarizing neuromuscular block. However, studies into the dose necessary to combating scopolamine intoxication are indicated.
Methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN) has rarely been reported as an allergen in adhesives but is recognized as a common allergen in skin care products in Europe. It has been banned for use in leave-on products by the European Union. In this study, we present a case with an unusual source of this common allergen and review all cases of allergy to MDBGN from our clinics over a 12-year period. A 49-year-old nurse presented with dermatitis affecting the vulva caused by MDBGN present in her sanitary pad. All other cases of allergy to MDBGN in patients attending the occupational dermatology or contact dermatitis clinics at the Skin and Cancer Foundation, Victoria, between January 1993 and December 2004, were reviewed. Patch testing was positive to her sanitary pad, the adhesive and MDBGN, which were used as a biocide in the pad adhesive. Only 20 cases of allergy to MDBGN have been diagnosed in 2837 patients tested during this period (0.7%). To conclude, this study highlights the importance of considering allergic contact dermatitis in the differential diagnosis of vulval rashes and the emergence of MDBGN as an important sensitizer. However, our review suggests that MDBGN remains an infrequent cause of allergy in Australia.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, are powerful antineoplastic agents that exert their antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on cancer cells by COX-dependent and/or COX-independent pathways. Celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the number of adenomatous colorectal polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Here, we show that celecoxib induces apoptosis in the colon cancer cell line HT-29 by inhibiting the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) activity. This effect was correlated with inhibition of the phosphorylation of the PDK1 downstream substrate Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) on two regulatory sites, Thr(308) and Ser(473). However, expression of a constitutive active form of Akt/PKB (myristoylated PKB) has a low protective effect toward celecoxib-induced cell death. In contrast, overexpression of constitutive active mutant of PDK1 (PDK1(A280V)) was as potent as the pancaspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, to impair celecoxib-induced apoptosis. By contrast, cells expressing a kinase-defective mutant of PDK1 (PDK1(K114G)) remained sensitive to celecoxib. Furthermore, in vitro measurement reveals that celecoxib was a potential inhibitor of PDK1 activity with an IC(50) = 3.5 microm. These data indicate that inhibition of PDK1 signaling is involved in the proapoptotic effect of celecoxib in HT-29 cells.
Belinostat is a hydroxamate class HDAC inhibitor that has demonstrated activity in peripheral T-cell lymphoma and is undergoing clinical trials for non-hematologic malignancies. We studied the pharmacokinetics of belinostat in hepatocellular carcinoma patients to determine the main pathway of metabolism of belinostat. The pharmacokinetics of belinostat in liver cancer patients were characterized by rapid plasma clearance of belinostat with extensive metabolism with more than 4-fold greater relative systemic exposure of major metabolite, belinostat glucuronide than that of belinostat. There was significant interindividual variability of belinostat glucuronidation. The major pathway of metabolism involves UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation and a good correlation has been identified between belinostat glucuronide formation and glucuronidation of known UGT1A1 substrates. In addition, liver microsomes harboring UGT1A1*28 alleles have lower glucuronidation activity for belinostat compared to those with wildtype UGT1A1. The main metabolic pathway of belinostat is through glucuronidation mediated primarily by UGT1A1, a highly polymorphic enzyme. The clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.

We investigated the role of the protein phosphatase inhibitor, dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32), in the expression of striatal neuropeptides and in biochemical and behavioural responses to repeated cocaine administration, using DARPP-32 knock-out mice. The striatum of DARPP-32-mutant mice showed heightened substance-P-like immunoreactivity, but normal levels of other neuropeptides. Repeated cocaine administration increased levels of DeltaFosB, a Fos family transcription factor, in the striatum of wild-type mice, and this increase was abolished in DARPP-32-mutant mice. Cocaine (20 mg/kg) acutely induced the same level of locomotor activity in the mutant and wild-type mice, but the mutants showed a higher rate of locomotor sensitization to repeated cocaine exposures. These data show that DARPP-32 is involved in regulating substance P expression in the striatonigral pathway, and in biochemical and behavioural plasticity with chronic administration of cocaine.
We assessed nitritoid reactions, which are a well recognized side effect of chrysotherapy that occur in roughly 5% of patients taking gold sodium thiomalate (GST).
Between January 1996 and January 2000, 8 patients followed in our gold monitoring program at Mary Pack Arthritis Centre experienced nitritoid reactions observed by the clinic nurse. We undertook a chart review to determine the risk factors, timing, course, and outcome of nitritoid reactions.
Patients' ages ranged from 36 to 69 years, and 7 of 8 were women. Duration of gold therapy prior to nitritoid reactions ranged from 13 months to 13 years. Seven had previously had mucocutaneous reactions, and one experienced gold dermatitis following a nitritoid reaction. Two of 8 patients were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor agents. Seven reactions were classified as mild, and one was a severe reaction with hypotension, syncope, and angina.
Management includes a high index of suspicion in patients experiencing nausea, flushing, or dizziness following gold injections, switching from GST to gold sodium aurothioglucose, injection in the recumbent position, and observation for 20 minutes after injections in individual patients.
