Male rat fetuses exposed to certain phthalate esters (PEs) during sexual differentiation display reproductive tract malformations due to reductions in testosterone (T) production and the expression of steroidogenesis- and INSL3-related genes. In the current study, we used a 96-well real-time PCR array containing key target genes representing sexual determination and differentiation, steroidogenesis, gubernaculum development, and androgen signaling pathways to rank the relative potency of several PEs. We executed dose-response studies with diisobutyl (DIBP), dipentyl (DPeP), dihexyl (DHP), diheptyl (DHeP), diisononyl (DINP), or diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP) and serial dilutions of a mixture of nine phthalates. All phthalates, with the exception of DIDP, reduced fetal testicular T production. Several genes involved in cholesterol transport, androgen synthesis, and Insl3 also were downregulated in a dose-responsive manner by DIBP, DPeP, DHP, DHeP, DINP, and the 9-PE mixture. Despite speculation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) involvement in the effects of PEs on the fetal testis, no PPAR-related genes were affected in the fetal testes by exposure to any of the tested PEs. Furthermore, the potent PPARα agonist, Wy-14,643, did not reduce fetal testicular T production following gestational day 14-18 exposure, suggesting that the antiandrogenic activity of PEs is not PPARα mediated. The overall sensitivity of the fetal endpoints (gene expression or T production) for the six phthalates from most to least was Cyp11b1 > Star = Scarb1 > Cyp17a1 = T production > Cyp11a1 = Hsd3b = Insl3 > Cyp11b2. The overall potency of the individual phthalates was DPeP > DHP > DIBP ≥ DHeP > DINP. Finally, the observed mixture interaction was adequately modeled by the dose-addition model for most of the affected genes. Together, these data advance our understanding of the collective reproductive toxicity of the PE compounds.
To investigate the role of extracellular calcium in bupivacaine-induced muscle injury, the effects of the drug on creatine kinase (CK) release and muscle ultrastructure were studied in the isolated rat soleus in the presence and absence of calcium and of the Ca-channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine. Control muscles maintained a constant CK release rate and normal morphology for at least 3 hours. CK release rates increased markedly after exposure to 1.5 mM and 5 mM bupivacaine and electron microscopy showed evidence of damage to mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum and the plasmalemma of muscle fibres with disruption of the Z-lines, I-bands and M-lines of myofibrils. When calcium was omitted from the incubation medium, there was a 3-fold reduction in CK release rates; the morphological changes were less severe initially but by 120 min were comparable to those in muscles incubated with bupivacaine and calcium. Neither 10(-6) M verapamil nor 10(-6) M nifedipine reduced CK release or muscle fibre damage. Verapamil (10(-5) M) reduced CK release but not the severity of muscle damage. The findings indicate that extracellular calcium plays a part in mediating the muscle damage caused by bupivacaine but that other factors must also be involved, and that Ca-channel blockers do not prevent muscle damage.
Although unresponsiveness to antimonial drugs in human leishmaniasis appears to be increasing, resistance to antimony in Leishmania is not well documented. Treatment of leishmaniasis in dogs, the domestic reservoir of L. infantum, with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) is a common practice in many Mediterranean countries. The dogs, however, remain highly infective to the phlebotomine vectors, even after several courses of treatment. A study was therefore carried out to test the comparative susceptibility to meglumine antimoniate of L. infantum stocks isolated from four naturally-infected dogs, before (BT) and after treatment (AT) with three to six courses of the drug, and used to infect Balb/c mice. Significant differences in suppression between the BT and AT stocks were observed in the infected mice when they were given the drug at a rate of 0.01-10 mg kg-1 day-1 for five days. Each AT stock was between eight and 41 times more resistant to meglumine antimoniate than the BT stock from the same dog, in terms of the ratios of the AT ED50 values to the corresponding BT values, which were calculated as indices of resistance. This result underlines the futility and danger of repeated antimonial treatments of dogs with signs of leishmaniasis, as these may produce a permanent reservoir of parasites unsusceptible to the drugs in human clinical use.
Although colchicine has been used for centuries, its neuromuscular toxicity in humans is largely unrecognized. In this report we describe a characteristic syndrome of myopathy and neuropathy and present 12 new cases of the condition. Colchicine myopathy may occur in patients with gout who take customary doses of the drug but who have elevated plasma drug levels because of altered renal function. It usually presents with proximal weakness and always presents with elevation of serum creatine kinase; both features remit within three to four weeks after the drug is discontinued. The accompanying axonal polyneuropathy is mild and resolves slowly. Electromyography of proximal muscles shows a myopathy that is marked by abnormal spontaneous activity. Because of these features, colchicine myoneuropathy is usually misdiagnosed initially, either as probable polymyositis or as uremic neuropathy. The myopathy is vacuolar, marked by accumulation of lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles unrelated to necrosis or to the mild denervation in distal muscles. The morphologic changes in muscle suggest that the pathogenesis involves disruption of a microtubule-dependent cytoskeletal network that interacts with lysosomes. Correct diagnosis may save patients with this disorder from inappropriate therapy.
Few studies of air pollutants address morbidity in preschool children. In this study we evaluated bronchitis in children from two Czech districts: Teplice, with high ambient air pollution, and Prachatice, characterized by lower exposures.
Our goal was to examine rates of lower respiratory illnesses in preschool children in relation to ambient particles and hydrocarbons.
Air monitoring for particulate matter < 2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was conducted daily, every third day, or every sixth day. Children born May 1994 through December 1998 were followed to 3 or 4.5 years of age to ascertain illness diagnoses. Mothers completed questionnaires at birth and at follow-up regarding demographic, lifestyle, reproductive, and home environmental factors. Longitudinal multivariate repeated-measures analysis was used to quantify rate ratios for bronchitis and for total lower respiratory illnesses in 1,133 children.
After adjustment for season, temperature, and other covariates, bronchitis rates increased with rising pollutant concentrations. Below 2 years of age, increments in 30-day averages of 100 ng/m(3) PAHs and of 25 microg/m(3) PM(2.5) resulted in rate ratios (RRs) for bronchitis of 1.29 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.54] and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.08-1.58), respectively; from 2 to 4.5 years of age, these RRs were 1.56 (95% CI, 1.22-2.00) and 1.23 (95% CI, 0.94-1.62), respectively.
Ambient PAHs and fine particles were associated with early-life susceptibility to bronchitis. Associations were stronger for longer pollutant-averaging periods and, among children > 2 years of age, for PAHs compared with fine particles. Preschool-age children may be particularly vulnerable to air pollution-induced illnesses.
The effects of cocaine on memory are controversial. Furthermore, the psychostimulant action of cocaine can be a critical issue in the interpretation of its effects on learning/memory models. The effects of a single administration of cocaine on memory were investigated during the presence of its motor stimulating effect or just after its termination. The plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PM-DAT) was used because it provides simultaneous information about memory, anxiety and motor activity. In Experiment I, mice received saline, 7.5, 10, 15 or 30 mg/kg cocaine 5 min before the training session. In Experiment II, mice were trained 30 min after the injection of saline, 7.5, 10, 15 or 30 mg/kg cocaine. In Experiment III, mice received 30 mg/kg cocaine 30 min pre-training and pre-test. In Experiment IV, mice received 30 mg/kg cocaine immediately post-training. Tests were always conducted 24 h following the training session. Given 5 min before training, cocaine promoted a motor stimulant effect at the highest dose during the training session but did not impair memory. When cocaine was injected 30 min pre-training, the drug did not modify motor activity, but produced marked amnestic effects at all doses tested. This amnesia induced by cocaine given 30 min pre-training was not related to a state-dependent learning because it was not abolished by pre-test administration of the drug. Post-training cocaine administration did not induce memory deficits either. Our results suggest that the post-stimulant phase is the critical moment for cocaine-induced memory deficit in a discriminative task in mice.
A 59-year-old man developed dystonia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy after receiving high doses of ergotamine for migraine treatment. Ischemia is suggested as the precipitating factor.
Ambient levels of pesticides ("pesticide drift") are detectable at residences near agricultural field sites.
Our goal was to evaluate the hypothesis that maternal residence near agricultural pesticide applications during key periods of gestation could be associated with the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children.
We identified 465 children with ASD born during 1996-1998 using the California Department of Developmental Services electronic files, and matched them by maternal date of last menstrual period to 6,975 live-born, normal-birth-weight, term infants as controls. We determined proximity to pesticide applications using California Department of Pesticide Regulation records refined using Department of Water Resources land use polygons. A staged analytic design applying a priori criteria to the results of conditional logistic regressions was employed to exclude associations likely due to multiple testing error.
Of 249 unique hypotheses, four that described organochlorine pesticide applications--specifically those of dicofol and endosulfan--occurring during the period immediately before and concurrent with central nervous system embryogenesis (clinical weeks 1 through 8) met a priori criteria and were unlikely to be a result of multiple testing. Multivariate a posteriori models comparing children of mothers living within 500 m of field sites with the highest nonzero quartile of organochlorine poundage to those with mothers not living near field sites suggested an odds ratio for ASD of 6.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-15.3). ASD risk increased with the poundage of organochlorine applied and decreased with distance from field sites.
The association between residential proximity to organochlorine pesticide applications during gestation and ASD among children should be further studied.
The neurotoxic effects of a single administration of methamphetamine (MA) were studied under conditions conducive to MA-induced hyperthermia. After a single dose of MA (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg/kg, s. c.) or saline (3 ml/kg) to Sprague-Dawley CD rats, rectal temperatures were monitored for 9 h in a room with an ambient temperature of 22.0+/-0.5 degrees C. MA induced significant dose-dependent hyperthermia, however, no significant increase in mortality occurred. Neostriatal DA, 5-HT, TH, and GFAP were assayed 3 days following treatment. MA induced dose-dependent reductions of DA, 5-HT and TH, and increased GFAP. For DA, at doses of 20, 30, or 40 mg/kg the reductions were to 71%, 49%, and 29%, and for 5-HT were to 73%, 44%, and 19% of control values. No reductions were seen after the 10 mg/kg dose. Semiquantitative analysis Western blots of TH and GFAP demonstrated that TH was reduced to 52%, 75%, and 28%, and GFAP was increased to 125%, 134%, and 149% of control values at MA doses of 20, 30, or 40 mg/kg, respectively. No significant changes in TH or GFAP were seen at the 10 mg/kg MA dose. These results demonstrate that a single-dose of MA can be as effective as the widely used four-dose every 2 h regimen. Moreover, mortality can be minimized by monitoring core body temperature and preventing MA-induced hyperthermia from exceeding 41.5 degrees C.
An animal model for nonbacterial prostatitis in rats was developed with the use of intraprostatic injection of capsaicin, an agent thought to excite C-afferent fibers and cause neurogenic inflammation. The analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) was tested in this model.
Adult male Spraque-Dawley rats were injected with varying doses of capsaicin into the prostate. The nociceptive effects of capsaicin were evaluated for 30min by using a behavior approach; then the prostate was removed for histology and cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 protein concentration measurement. Evans blue (50mg/kg) was also injected intravenously to assess for plasma protein extravasation. A second set of animals were injected with up to 20U of BoNT-A into the prostates 1 wk prior to intraprostatic injection of 1000micromol/l capsaicin.
Capsaicin dose dependently induced modifications in pain behavior: closing of the eyes, hypolocomotion, and inflammatory changes: increase of inflammatory cell accumulation, COX2 expression, and plasma extravasation at the acute stage, but completely recovered at 1 wk. BoNT-A pretreatment dose dependently reversed pain behavior and inflammation. BoNT-A 20U significantly decreased inflammatory cell accumulation, COX2 expression, and Evans blue extraction (82.1%, 83.0%, and 50.4%, respectively), and reduced pain behavior (66.7% for eye score and 46.5% for locomotion score).
Intraprostatic capsaicin injection induced neurogenic prostatitis and prostatic pain, and may be a useful research model. BoNT-A produced anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, and support clinical evaluation in prostatitis.
A temporal and causal relationship has been established between inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by organophosphorous compounds, accumulation of Ca2+, an increase of neutral protease activity and the development of the ultrastructural signs of subacute myopathy.
The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist, xanomeline, attenuates amphetamine-induced activity in WT mice. This effect is abolished in mice lacking the M(4) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M(4) mAChR KO) and partially attenuated in mice lacking M(1) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M(1) mAChR KO). Collectively, these data suggest that the efficacy exhibited by xanomeline in the mouse amphetamine-induced hyperactivity model, is mediated predominantly by M(4) muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and that M(1) muscarinic acetylcholine receptors may play a more minor role. This supports the hypothesis that activation of M(4), and to a lesser extent M(1) muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, may represent a potential target for the treatment of psychosis seen in schizophrenia.
Triclosan is an anti-bacterial agent used in many personal care products, household items, medical devices, and clinical settings. Liver tumors occur in mice exposed to triclosan, a response attributed to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) activation; however, the effects of triclosan on mouse and human PPARα have not been fully evaluated. We compared the effects of triclosan on mouse and human PPARα using PPARα reporter assays and on downstream events of PPARα activation using mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells and human hepatoma HepG2 cells. PPARα transcriptional activity was increased by triclosan in a mouse PPARα reporter assay and decreased in a human PPARα reporter assay. Concentrations of triclosan inhibiting 50% cell growth were similar in both human and mouse hepatoma cells. Western blotting analysis showed that triclosan increased acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (ACOX1), a PPARα target, in Hepa1c1c7 cells but decreased the level in HepG2 cells. Treatment of Hepa1c1c7 cells with triclosan enhanced DNA synthesis and suppressed transforming growth factor beta-mediated apoptosis. This did not occur in HepG2 cells. These data demonstrate that triclosan had similar cytotoxicity in Hepa1c1c7 and HepG2 cells, but differential effects on the activation of PPARα, the expression of ACOX1, and downstream events including DNA synthesis and apoptosis.
Minocycline is an antibacterial drug used in the treatment of acne. Concern has been expressed over the possibility of severe adverse reactions to minocycline, including hepatitis. This study set out to identify and characterise reported cases of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of minocycline.
A systematic review of the literature including a search of computerised databases and analysis of data from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring) was conducted. The review involved a search for original case reports involving liver damage in people using minocycline. Patients taking minocycline for reasons other than acne or those given intravenous minocycline were excluded. The search strategy involved an enquiry of computerised databases and a search for secondary references. Cases were then classified appropriately.
65 reported cases of hepatitis or liver damage in association with minocycline from either case reports or case series were identified from the literature review. 58% of cases occurred in females and 94% were aged under 40 years. For 20 case reports there was insufficient information to classify the type of event, but for the remaining 45, 2 types of hepatic reaction were recognised: autoimmune hepatitis associated with lupus-like symptoms occurring after a median duration of exposure to minocycline of 365 days in females (n = 20) and 730 days in males (n = 9), hypersensitivity reaction associated with eosinophilia and exfoliative dermatitis occurring within 35 days of therapy (n = 16). Reports to the WHO of hepatic adverse drug reactions associated with minocycline accounted for 6% (493) of all minocycline-related adverse drug reactions (8025). The pattern of distribution in relation to exposure demonstrated 2 groups, similar to that described by the case reports.
Severe cases of minocycline-associated hepatotoxicity appear to be a hypersensitivity reaction and occur within a few weeks of commencing therapy. An autoimmune hepatitis usually presents after exposure to minocycline of a year or more, is more common in women and is sometimes associated with lupus-like symptoms.
Poisoning by organophosphate nerve agents can induce seizures which rapidly become refractory to treatment and result in brain damage. Current therapies have only a narrow time frame for effective administration after poisoning. 5-HT1A agonists were tested for efficacy in mice against a seizure-producing combination of the carboxylesterase inhibitor 2-(o-cresyl)-4H-1:3:2-benzodioxaphosphorin-2-oxide (CBDP) and sarin, producing an LD20-40. Administration of the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in mice when administered 1min after CBDP and sarin while other 5-HT1A agonists buspirone and S-14506 were not effective. The reduction in GFAP staining by 8-OH-DPAT remained significant when a single dose was administered 2h after the toxic challenge. In addition, 8-OH-DPAT reversed the increase in the inflammatory factor IL-1β in the dentate gyrus and amygdala but did not reduce positive TUNEL staining in the dentate gyrus. Due to the failure of the two other agonists to provide protection, the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 was tested. WAY-100635 was found to neither reverse the neuroprotective effects of 8-OH-DPAT nor worsen the damage when given alone, making a role for this receptor unlikely. The neuroprotective effects of 8-OH-DPAT appear to lie within its secondary pharmacology.
The xylenes are commonly used industrial solvents that have been shown to inhibit cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) activities in an organ- and isozyme-specific pattern. This study examined the dose-response and durational effects of m-xylene inhalation on cytochrome P-450 activities in the respiratory tract and liver as well as the effects of these CYP450 alterations on 1-nitronaphthalene (1-NN)-induced respiratory or hepatic toxicity. After m-xylene inhalation exposure there was a dose-related inhibition of all nasal mucosa CYPs examined. At 300 ppm, inhibition was sustained up to 2 days after exposure, but on day 5 all CYP activities were increased. There was also dose-related inhibition of lung CYPs 2B1, 2E1, and 4B1. The activities of these CYPs returned to those of control by day 2 but lung CYP 2B1 was increased 5 days following m-xylene exposure. Hepatic CYP 2E1 activity was increased immediately following m-xylene exposure (300 ppm). CYP 2B1 and CYP 1A2 activities were increased through day 2, all activities returning to control values 5 days postexposure. 1-NN treatment caused severe respiratory toxicity that was prevented by prior m-xylene exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and protein were increased in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) but gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) was unchanged. m-Xylene coexposure prevented or ameliorated the increases in LDH and protein but increased GGT. 1-NN-induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) LDH and GGT were attenuated by m-xylene. 1-NN caused pronounced histopathological changes in both respiratory and olfactory regions of the nasal mucosa. Lesions in both regions were characterized by acute epithelial necrosis and exfoliation and suppurative exudate in the airways. These changes were prevented by m-xylene coexposure. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were not changed in animals exposed to 1-NN but were increased by m-xylene coexposure. Low-level m-xylene exposure organ-selectively altered CYP450 isozyme activities and subsequent 1-NN toxicity.
This study used tumour specimens from a clinical trial on intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) to study the effects of castration on tissue morphology, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the expression of androgen receptor (AR).
A total of 113 representative needle biopsy specimens were available from 29 patients for evaluation of the Gleason score as well as Ki-67, cleaved caspase-3, and AR immunostaining.
At 6 mo from the beginning of the first androgen withdrawal, cell proliferation activity was significantly (p = 0.002) reduced, whereas no effect on apoptosis was found. A nonsignificant trend to an increase in Gleason score after castration was found. Subsequent cycles of withdrawals had no significant effect on any of the measured parameters. The Gleason score, proliferation activity, and apoptosis rate showed only heterogeneous, nonsignificant changes after the first progression. Strong nuclear AR staining was evident in all cancer specimens.
The findings suggest that the long-term (months) effect of androgen withdrawal on tumour growth is due to the inhibition of proliferation. Because the tumours seem to become resistant to castration at the first cycle of treatment withheld, it is possible that IAS does not postpone the emergence of ablation-resistant tumours. There was no consistent sign of increased proliferation or Gleason score during the treatment, suggesting that the biologic aggressiveness of a particular tumour is defined already at an early stage of disease. The constant nuclear expression of AR in cancer cells indicates that the AR signalling remains active despite of the androgen withdrawal.
A total of 261 adverse ocular reactions occurred in 237 patients who received isotretinoin, a commonly used drug in the treatment of severe cystic acne. Blepharoconjunctivitis, subjective complaints of dry eyes, blurred vision, contact lens intolerance, and photodermatitis are reversible side effects. More serious ocular adverse reactions include papilledema, pseudotumor cerebri, and white or gray subepithelial corneal opacities; all of these are reversible if the drug is discontinued. Reported cases of decreased dark adaptation are under investigation. Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the many reported congenital abnormalities after maternal use (including microphthalmos, orbital hypertelorism, and optic nerve hypoplasia).
Nitric oxide-donating aspirin (NO-aspirin), representing a new concept in the development of more efficacious nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, consists of traditional aspirin bearing -ONO(2), which releases NO. Conventional aspirin prevents human colon cancer, but its toxicity precludes its application as a chemopreventive agent. NO-aspirin seems safer and in cultured cancer cells it is >1000-fold more potent than aspirin. To determine the mechanism by which NO-aspirin inhibits cell growth, we studied its effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in HT-29 human colon cancer cells. NO-aspirin stimulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Akt only marginally. The greatest increases in phosphorylation were seen in cJun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinases, which were observed as early as 5 min and after 1 h of treatment, averaged more than 10-fold over control. The activation of JNK and p38 was accompanied by large increases in the phosphorylation of the downstream transcription factors cJun and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2). We used specific MAPK inhibitors, small interfering (siRNA) gene silencing methods, and dominant-negative cJun to determine the relevance of these phosphorylation events to the ability of NO-aspirin to inhibit colon cancer cell growth. Only the dual inhibitor of p38 and JNK and the use of combined siRNA silencing of p38 and cJun abrogated the ability of NO-aspirin to block cell growth. Our data indicate that NO-aspirin is dependent on both the p38 and the JNK MAP kinase pathways for its ability to inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells.
Lead exposure is a known cause of hypertension. Although most studies have focused on lead-induced endothelial dysfunction and on the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it has been recently demonstrated that the vascular wall of lead-exposed rats has both an altered the endothelium-independent relaxing response and a reduced expression of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). The aim of the present study was to determine in in vitro incubated rat isolated aortic segments if lead downregulates sGC expression, analyzing the involvement of ROS and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The experiments were performed in isolated aortic segments from Wistar rats that were incubated with lead for 24 h. Lead significantly reduced sGC-beta(1) subunit expression in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal reduction in sGC-beta(1) subunit expression was achieved with 1 ppm lead. Vitamin C (30 micromol/L) partially restored sGC-beta( 1) subunit expression in lead (1 ppm)-exposed aortic segments. A similar protection of sGC-beta(1) subunit expression was obtained with both a protein kinase A inhibitor, H89 (1 micromol/L) and with rofecoxib (1 micromol/L), an inhibitor of COX-2 activity. Moreover, lead exposure increased COX-2 expression in the arterial wall. While vitamin C reduced both COX-2 expression and superoxide anion production related to lead exposure, rofecoxib failed to modify superoxide anion generation in lead-incubated aortic segments. In conclusion, the present results suggest the involvement of ROS and COX-2 in the downexpression of sGC-beta(1) subunit induced by lead in the rat vascular wall.
Quizalofop-p-ethyl is an often applied, slightly toxic herbicide for which no severe toxicity has been reported in humans.
We present the case of a farmer exposed to quizalofop-p-ethyl who presented with obstructive cholestasis. A complete workup disclosed no other cause of liver pathology, but liver biopsy established drug-induced hepatotoxicity. The patient was treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and prednisolone, and was recovered fully 70 days after his exposure to the herbicide. The patient was followed for the next 9 months.
Quizalofop-p-ethyl can induce a mixed cholestatic/hepatocellular liver injury. We discuss possible mechanisms implicated in liver injury after exposure to quizalofop-p-ethyl.
In patients presenting with mixed cholestatic/ hepatocellular liver injury, occupational exposure to quizalofop-p-ethyl in the course of agricultural use should be investigated.
To study the protective effect of bicyclol on alcohol-induced liver injury in mice.
Sixty male mice were randomly divided into 6 groups. Ten mice were fed with Lieber-Decarli liquid diet without alcohol and used as normal controls. Fifty mice were fed with Lieber-Decarli liquid diet containing 5% alcohol for four weeks so as to establish a model of alcohol-induced liver damage. Ten mice fed with Lieber-Decarli liquid diet containing 5% alcohol for four weeks were used as model group. Bicyclol in a dose of either 200 or 300 .kg(-1).d(-1) was given orally simultaneously with alcohol intake as prevention groups (10 mice in each group), and bicyclol in a dose of either 200 or 300 .kg(-1).d(-1) was given orally 2 weeks after the beginning of alcohol intake as treatment groups (10 mice in each group). Twenty-four hours after the last dose of bicyclol the mice were decapitated and then their blood samples and livers were taken. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol (CHOL), and high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein (HDL/LDL), and liver triglyceride (TG), N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMA-DM), glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) were determined by biochemical assays. The extent of liver damage was evaluated by histological examination.
Four weeks after alcohol intake the serum ALT and TG were 1.9 and 2.7 times those of the normal control group. The levels of liver TG of the bicyclol 200 kg(-1).d(-1) and 300 kg(-1).d(-1) treatment groups were significantly lower than that of the model group by 28% and 32% respectively (both P < 0.05). The levels of liver TG of the bicyclol 200 kg(-1).d(-1) and 300 kg(-1).d(-1) prevention groups were significantly lower than that of the model group by 32%, and 47% respectively (both P < 0.01). Pathological changes including steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning degeneration were found in the livers of the model group. The levels of liver GSH, GST, and GR in the model group decreased by 37%, 22%, and 19% in comparison with the normal control group. The levels of liver GSH and GST of the bicyclol prevention groups were normal, and the liver GR level was 1.2 times that of the normal control group. The liver NDMA-DM activity of the model group was 1.9 times that of the normal control group and was normal in the bicyclol prevention and treatment groups. The liver cytoplasmic ALDH level was 30% lower in the model group than in the normal control group (P < 0.05), and was 2.9 times in the bicyclol groups (P < 0.01). The serum cholesterol levels of the bicyclol groups were all significantly lower than that of the model group (all P < 0.01). The serum levels of HDL of the bicyclol prevention groups and treatment were all significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05).
Bicyclol protects mice against alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity by reduction of hepatic steatosis and cellular damage, acceleration of alcohol and aldehyde elimination and anti-peroxidation.
1. Deoxycorticosterone, which does not enhance tryptophan pyrrolase activity, also fails to alter the concentrations of the NAD(P) couples in livers of fed rats, whereas corticosterone increases both pyrrolase activity and dinucleotide concentrations. 2. Starvation of rats increases serum corticosterone concentration, lipolysis, tryptophan availability to the liver, tryptophan pyrrolase activity and liver [NADP(H)]. Glucose prevents all these changes. 3. The beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent propranolol prevents the starvation-induced lipolysis and the consequent increase in tryptophan availability to the liver, but does not influence the increase in serum corticosterone concentration, liver pyrrolase activity and [NADP(H)]. 4. Actinomycin D, which prevents the starvation-induced increases in liver pyrrolase activity and [NADP(H)], does not affect those in serum corticosterone concentration and tryptophan availability to the liver. 5. Allopurinol, which blocks the starvation-induced enhancement of pyrrolase activity, also abolishes the increases in liver [NADP(H)], but not those in serum corticosterone concentration or tryptophan availability to the liver. 6. It is suggested that liver tryptophan pyrrolase activity plays an important role in NAD+ synthesis from tryptophan in the rat.
The article presents an observation of a 63-year-old female patient suffering from arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease complicated by a persistent form of atrial fibrillation during 1.5 months, and hereditary Minkowski-Chauffard hemolytic anemia. Treatment with cordaron proved to be ineffective, while oral administration of quinidin in a dose of 1 gr (0.2 gr five times a day) led to restoration of sinus rhythm. However, long QT interval syndrome complicated by ventricular tachycardic paroxysms of torsade de pointes type developed; later it transformed into ventricular fibrillation.
Previous studies have indicated a critical role of adenosine and its receptors in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) to acute ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity. Wild-type (WT) and A1AR(-/-) mice were intragastrically administered with ethanol (5 g/kg), and hepatic injury was evaluated 6h thereafter. Mice lacking A1AR were more susceptible to ethanol-induced liver damage than WT mice, as evidenced by higher serum transaminase levels and increased extent of histopathological changes. Ethanol induced triglycerides accumulation in the serum and liver, and this accumulation was augmented in A1AR(-/-) mice. Analysis of gene expression in the liver revealed up-regulated mRNA levels of genes related to lipogenesis (including: FAS, SCD1, ACC1, DGAT2, and PPARγ) in A1AR(-/-) mice after ethanol treatment. In addition, lack of A1AR aggravated lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase depletion caused by acute ethanol exposure. A subsequent study revealed that, pretreatment with A1AR antagonist DPCPX increases the sensitivity of mice to ethanol-induced liver injury. In conclusion, these results indicated that endogenous A1AR activation protects mice against acute ethanol-induced liver injury by reducing oxidative stress and decreasing lipid accumulation.
