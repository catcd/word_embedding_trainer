Evidence that rofecoxib increases the risk of myocardial infarction has led to scrutiny of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Regulatory agencies have provided variable advice regarding the cardiovascular risks with older nonselective NSAIDs.
To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies to compare the risks of serious cardiovascular events with individual NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors.
Searches were conducted of electronic databases (1985-2006), scientific meeting proceedings, epidemiological research Web sites, and bibliographies of eligible studies.
Eligible studies were of case-control or cohort design, reported on cardiovascular events (predominantly myocardial infarction) with cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, NSAID use, or both with nonuse/remote use of the drugs as the reference exposure. Of 7086 potentially eligible titles, 17 case-control and 6 cohort studies were included. Thirteen studies reported on cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, 23 on NSAIDs, and 13 on both groups of drugs.
Two people independently extracted data and assessed study quality with disagreements resolved by consensus.
Data were combined using a random-effects model. A dose-related risk was evident with rofecoxib, summary relative risk with 25 mg/d or less, 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.79) and 2.19 (95% CI, 1.64-2.91) with more than 25 mg/d. The risk was elevated during the first month of treatment. Celecoxib was not associated with an elevated risk of vascular occlusion, summary relative risk 1.06 (95% CI, 0.91-1.23). Among older nonselective drugs, diclofenac had the highest risk with a summary relative risk of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.16-1.70). The other drugs had summary relative risks close to 1: naproxen, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87-1.07); piroxicam, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.70-1.59); and ibuprofen, 1.07 (95% CI, 0.97-1.18).
This review confirms the findings from randomized trials regarding the risk of cardiovascular events with rofecoxib and suggests that celecoxib in commonly used doses may not increase the risk, contradicts claims of a protective effect of naproxen, and raises serious questions about the safety of diclofenac, an older drug.
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of sulphasalazine (SASP) in the treatment of children with chronic arthritis. The medical records of 36 children (25 boys, 11 girls) who received SASP for the treatment of chronic arthritis were reviewed. Twenty-one patients had juvenile spondyloarthropathies (JSA) (eight juvenile ankylosing spondylitis (JAS), 13 undifferentiated JSA (uJSA) and 15 had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). The patients received SASP therapy for a mean of 2.5 years (range 3 weeks to 8.1 years). Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed retrospectively to determine the effects of treatment. A clinically significant response occurred in 23 (64%) children: remission in 14 (39%) (JRA 5, JSA 9) and improvement (25% reduction in joint count) in nine (25%) (JRA 4, JSA 5). There was no difference in response rate between JRA and JSA patients (p = 0.11), but the time to remission was shorter in JSA patients (mean 5 months) than in JRA patients (mean 25 months) (p = 0.024). Twelve of the 36 patients discontinued non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and six of eight patients discontinued prednisolone. A significant fall in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and rise in haemoglobin occurred in SASP-treated patients (p < 0.005) comparing most recent results with pretreatment levels. Side-effects occurred in four of 36 patients (11%); only one patient who had persisting severe diarrhoea required discontinuation of SASP. It was concluded that SASP appears to be effective and safe in the treatment of JRA and JSA patients. As a second-line agent, SASP is the drug of first choice for patients with JSA; for JRA patients SASP may be a useful, possibly less toxic alternative to methotrexate.
Genetic factors are known to be important in the development of prostate cancer. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a multifunctional cytokine that induces interferon-gamma secretion and plays an important role in antitumor immunity. Variations in the DNA sequence in the IL-18 gene promoter may lead to altered IL-18 production and/or activity, and so this can modulate an individual's susceptibility to prostate cancer. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship of IL-18 gene promoter -137 G/C and -607 C/A polymorphisms and their haplotypes with the risk of prostate cancer. We analyzed two single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL-18 gene promoter -137 G/C and -607 C/A in 265 patients with prostate cancer and 280 age- and sex-matched controls, using sequence-specific primers-polymerase chain reaction strategy. There were significant differences in the genotype and allele distribution of -137 G/C polymorphism of the IL-18 gene among cases and controls. The -137 GC and CC genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer as compared with the -137 GG genotypes [odds ratio (OR) = 1.721; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.187-2.496; p = 0.004, and OR = 2.181; 95% CI: 1.034-4.603; p = 0.037, for GC and CC, respectively]. Consistent with the results of the genotyping analyses, the -137C/-607A haplotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer as compared with the -137G/-607C haplotype (OR = 1.544; 95% CI, 1.137-2.096; p = 0.005). This study shows for the first time an association between IL-18 gene promoter -137 G/C polymorphism and prostate cancer in a Chinese population.
We induced acute skeletal muscle necrosis in rats using bupivacaine hydrochloride and found that both 2,5- and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid significantly increased in skeletal muscle. A single administration of dimethyl sulphoxide, a free radical scavenger, significantly lowered concentrations of 2,5- and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. These results suggest that dimethyl sulphoxide is an effective hydroxyl radical scavenger and may be useful in the treatment of myopathy.
The authors examined the association of the alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) genotype with vascular events in community-dwelling Japanese (1,102 men/1,093 women). The allele ADH2*2 encodes an isozyme with a higher level of activity than ADH2*1. Here, the authors show that the ADH2*1 carriage is associated with high prevalence of cerebral infarction and lacunae in men. Multiple regression analyses confirmed that the risk of lacunae and cerebral infarction was increased by the ADH2*1 allele.
Cisplatin (CP) is a widely used antineoplastic drug that exhibits gastrointestinal toxicity. We have previously shown that administration of a single dose of CP results in a decrease in the activities of several brush border membrane (BBM) enzymes, induces oxidative stress and alters the activities of several antioxidant enzymes in the small intestine of rats. In the present study we have investigated the effect of treatment with the dietary antioxidant caffeic acid (CA) on CP induced biochemical changes in the intestine. Administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of CP alone (6 mg/kg body weight) led to a decrease in the activities of the BBM enzymes, increase in lipid peroxidation, decrease in sulfhydryl groups and changes in the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase and thioredoxin reductase. Administration of two doses of CA (each of 250 mg/kg body weight), at 15 and 120 min after treatment with CP, significantly attenuated the CP-induced changes in all these parameters but the administration of CA alone had no effect. These results suggest that CA is an effective agent in reducing the effects of CP on the intestine and could prove to be useful in alleviating the gastrointestinal toxicity of this drug.
The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. 18 patients, referred to a radiocontrast study, considered at risk because of preexisting renal insufficiency, were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, performed at the secondary care center of a 1,100-bed private university hospital. In addition to fluids, the treatment group received furosemide (mean dose 110 mg) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material. The control group received fluids (mean 3 liters). Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non-ionic contrast material, at an average dose of 245 ml. Renal function significantly deteriorated in the group pretreated with furosemide (p < 0.005 by ANOVA), with a rise in serum creatinine from 145 +/- 13 to 182 +/- 16 mumol/l at 24 h, while no change occurred in the control group (from 141 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 7 mumol/l). Renal failure was associated with weight loss in the furosemide-treated group. Furosemide may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.
Angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are regarded as first-line treatments for type-2 diabetes with hypertension. Despite the availability of various types of ARBs, there are no comparative studies of their effects on patients with diabetes. In this open-label prospective crossover study, we compared the effects of olmesartan (20 mg/day) and telmisartan (40 mg/day). Twenty Japanese early-stage type-2 diabetes patients with hypertension treated with valsartan (80 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks were recruited to this study. At study entry, valsartan was changed to olmesartan (20 mg/day) or telmisartan (40 mg/day) and administered for 8 weeks. The drugs were then switched and treatment was continued for another 8 weeks. We analyzed the blood pressure lowering effects of each drug by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at 0, 8, and 16 weeks. Simultaneously, we measured metabolic parameters and inflammation markers. Olmesartan lowered mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure more significantly than did telmisartan. While there were no differences between the groups in metabolic parameters, including HbA1c and adiponectin, the decreases in serum interleukin-6 and highly sensitive C-reactive protein were more significant by olmesartan treatment. Our results indicate that olmesartan has more potent arterial blood pressure lowering and anti-inflammatory effects than telmisartan.
Dyslipidaemia that includes high levels of triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Hepatic lipase gene encoding a lipolytic enzyme participating in remodelling of plasma lipoproteins and formation of serum lipid profile is a promising candidate gene for type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the G-250A promoter polymorphism of the LIPC gene predicts the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes.
Study population comprised of subjects who participated in the STOP-NIDDM trial aiming to investigate the effect of acarbose compared with placebo on the prevention of type 2 diabetes in subjects with IGT.
Compared with subjects carrying the G-250G genotype, subjects with the A-250A genotype of the LIPC gene had a 2.35-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-4.33, P = 0.006] higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Subjects in the placebo group and all women carrying the A-250A genotype had an especially high risk for the conversion to type 2 diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 2.74, 95% CI 1.14-6.61, P = 0.024 and OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.35-10.1, P = 0.011 respectively].
The G-250A promoter polymorphism of the LIPC gene is associated with an increased risk of development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk subjects with IGT. Therefore, genes regulating atherogenic dyslipidaemia are promising candidate genes for type 2 diabetes.
When a patient with acetaminophen overdose arrives in the emergency room more than 14 hours after ingestion, the value of N-acetylcysteine is unproven and patient mortality is at least 10%. Anecdotal case reports have indicated benefit of extracorporeal detoxification of these late-arriving patients with acetaminophen overdose. We identified 10 patients with serious acetaminophen overdose, 8 that arrived in the emergency room 16 to 44 hours after acetaminophen overdose with plasma levels predicting severe hepatic toxicity, and 2 that arrived in the emergency room 8 to 12 hours after overdose but with exceedingly high levels. All patients developed severe hepatitis (mean peak alanine aminotransferase, 4,052; mean peak protime, 25 seconds). At 16 to 68 hours after overdose, the patients were treated for 4 to 6 hours with the Liver Dialysis System (Hemocleanse Inc, W. Lafayette, IN), a single-access hemodiabsorption system indicated for treatment of serious drug overdose and for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Acetaminophen levels fell an average of 73% during treatment. Treatment was repeated 24 or 48 hours later if acetaminophen was still measurable in plasma. All 10 patients recovered intrinsic liver function and general health, with liver enzymes starting to normalize 24 hours after treatment, and were discharged 3 to 7 days after overdose. No patient required liver transplant. Because market introduction of Liver Dialysis, there have been 40 more patients with acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity treated with Liver Dialysis. All have recovered liver function without long-term sequelae. Though most of these patients with already established hepatic toxicity from acetaminophen would recover without extracorporeal blood therapy, treatment with the Liver Dialysis System should assure recovery from acute hepatic failure, and may shorten the clinical course of the illness.
Bilateral leg compartment syndrome due to myonecrosis caused by inappropriate use of statins is a rare but potentially fatal complication of this lipid lowering medication. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with suspicious critical lower limb ischemia. Subsequently, bilateral leg compartment syndrome and myonecrosis developed. The primary cause of myonecrosis was due to misuse of simvastatin mistaken by the patient for a weight-reducing drug. Urgent fasciotomies were performed and the patient underwent urgent renal replacement therapy with continuous hemodialysis for acute renal failure due to myoglobinuria. After this complex treatment, the patient was discharged. She almost fully recovered with only a residual paresis of the left fibular nerve. According to literature, this is a unique case of bilateral compartment syndrome and myonecrosis with acute renal failure due to statin overdose leading to acute renal failure and bilateral fasciotomy.
The ApcDelta716 knockout mouse develops hundreds of intestinal polyps and smaller numbers in the colon because of the truncation of the suppressor protein Apc. We show inhibition of polyposis in the ApcDelta716 mouse by rofecoxib (Vioxx), a specific cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. Both the number and size of polyps in the ApcDelta716 mouse were markedly reduced by rofecoxib (Vioxx) treatment at plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in humans with antiinflammatory concentrations of Vioxx. Sulindac, a dual cyclooxygenase-1/2 inhibitor, also diminished size and number of polyps but to a lesser extent than rofecoxib. The protein expression of COX-1 or COX-2 was unchanged by treatment with rofecoxib or sulindac because these agents inhibit enzyme activity and prostaglandin product formation rather than transcription of the COX genes. The proangiogenic protein vascular derived endothelial growth factor was decreased in polyps treated with rofecoxib, whereas membrane-associated beta-catenin increased in rofecoxib-treated polyps. DNA proliferation was decreased in polyps by both rofecoxib and sulindac treatment. Rofecoxib (Vioxx) is used clinically for osteoarthritis and pain, and in addition the results described here suggest that Vioxx may be useful as a chemopreventive in humans at risk for colorectal neoplasia.
To compare extracellular and intracellular activities of telavancin (versus vancomycin) against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA, VISA and VRSA).
Determination of cfu changes (3-24 h) in culture medium and in macrophages at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000x MIC.
Extracellularly, telavancin displayed a fast, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against all strains. The concentration-effect relationship was bimodal for MSSA and MRSA [two successive sharp drops in bacterial counts (0.3-1x MIC and 100-1000x MIC) separated by a zone of low concentration dependency]. When compared at human total drug Cmax (vancomycin, 50 mg/L; telavancin, 90 mg/L) towards MSSA, MRSA and VISA, telavancin caused both a faster and more marked decrease of cfu, with the limit of detection (>5 log decrease) reached already at 6 versus 24 h for vancomycin. Intracellularly, the bactericidal activity of telavancin was less intense [-3 log (MSSA) to -1.5 log (VRSA) at Cmax and at 24 h]. A bimodal relationship with respect to concentration (at 24 h) was observed for both MSSA and MRSA. In contrast, vancomycin exhibited only marginal intracellular activity towards intraphagocytic MSSA, MRSA and VISA (max. -0.5 log decrease at 24 h and at Cmax).
Telavancin showed time- and concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against both extracellular and intracellular S. aureus with various resistance phenotypes. The data support the use of telavancin in infections where intracellular and extracellular S. aureus are present. Bimodality of dose responses (MSSA and MRSA) could indicate multiple mechanisms of action for telavancin.
One hundred and thirty-eight stage II and III colorectal cancer patients were included to evaluate the prognostic significance of genetic markers (including mutations of the p53, K-ras genes, and microsatellite instability) on the response to 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based post-operative adjuvant therapies (PAT). When stratified by PAT and adjusting for other prognostic variables, presence of p53 mutation was associated with a poor outcome (hazard ratio (HR)=3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-11.0) among patients without PAT. Our data confirmed that p53 mutation is an independent pre-treatment factor in stage II and III colorectal cancer after curative resection.
Data on minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are available only in the context of conventional all-trans retinoic acid plus chemotherapy regimens. It is recognized that the kinetics of leukemia clearance is different with the use of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in the treatment of APL. We undertook a prospective peripheral blood RT-PCR-based MRD monitoring study on patients with APL treated with a single agent ATO regimen. A total of 151 patients were enrolled in this study. A positive RT-PCR reading at the end of induction therapy was significantly associated on a multivariate analysis with an increased risk of relapse (relative risk = 4.9; P = .034). None of the good risk patients who were RT-PCR negative at the end of induction relapsed. The majority of the relapses (91%) happened within 3 years of completion of treatment. After achievement of molecular remission, the current MRD monitoring strategy was able to predict relapse in 60% of cases with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 93.2%, respectively. High-risk group patients and those that remain RT-PCR positive at the end of induction are likely to benefit from serial MRD monitoring by RT-PCR for a period of 3 years from completion of therapy.
1. Treatment responses are lower in immune compromised patients such as those with hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease following liver transplantation than in immune competent patients with HCV disease. 2. Predictors of nonresponse, extrapolated from studies of immune competent patients, are overly represented in liver transplantation patients (high levels of HCV RNA and genotype 1 infection). 3. Tolerability of peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy is lower in transplant patients than in immune competent patients with HCV disease, in part because of a baseline renal insufficiency that increases the likelihood of ribavirin-associated anemia. 4. Clear recommendations regarding optimal treatment regimens for patients with posttransplantation HCV disease are problematic since there are few prospective, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated different treatment regimens. 5. If treatment is undertaken, baseline creatinine clearance should be measured and patients should be started on a dose of ribavirin of 400mg bid, or lower if renal function is impaired. 6. Tolerated peginterferon doses may be somewhat lower than for the standard immune competent patients. It is likely that lower doses will not greatly compromise response (1.0 ug/kg/week for peginterferon alfa 2b and 135 ug/week for peginterferon alfa 2a). 7. Optimal treatment duration is unknown. In patients with an on-treatment response, at least 12 months of therapy is recommended. 8. More potent drugs with fewer toxicities are needed for patients with progressive posttransplantation liver disease.
23 patients with a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomly assigned to 8 weeks' treatment with alprazolam or placebo. They filled in self-ratings before and after treatment and competed on a competitive reaction time task, designed to measure behavioural aggression, after 8 weeks' treatment. Patients taking both alprazolam and placebo rated decreased anxiety after 8 weeks' treatment but those on alprazolam also tended to report less hostility. On the behavioural task, patients on alprazolam behaved more aggressively in response to provocation. This is the first study to confirm clinical reports of benzodiazepine-induced dyscontrol on an objective laboratory measure. It is important that it is followed up in a larger group of patients.
Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IP) is a non-alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that has tumor-initiating activity on mouse skin and is carcinogenic in newborn mice and in rat lungs. Previous studies have shown that 8- and 9-hydroxyIP and IP-1,2-diol are major metabolites formed in vivo in mouse skin. 8-HydroxyIP-1,2-diol and 9-hydroxyIP-1,2-diol are also observed as in vivo metabolites of IP. Although 8-hydroxyIP had marginal tumor-initiating activity on mouse skin, IP-1,2-diol and its epoxide precursor, IP-1,2-oxide, had similar tumorigenic activity as IP. In the present study fluorine probes have been employed to investigate the contribution of metabolic activation at the 1,2 and 7-10 positions of IP. At a total initiating dose of 4.0 mumol, 2-fluoroIP induced skin tumors in 76% of the treated animals with an average of 3.9 tumors/mouse. At the same dose, IP induced a 72% incidence of tumor-bearing mice with 2.1 tumors/mouse. In contrast, 8,9-difluoroIP elicited a tumorigenic response in 40% of the treated animals with 0.6 tumors/animal. Five mice from each experimental group were killed at the conclusion of the initiation phase of the bioassay and DNA was isolated from the treated areas of skin. 32P-Postlabeling analysis of the hydrolyzed DNA indicated that IP forms one major detectable DNA adduct that migrates close to the origin. This adduct is absent in mice treated with 8,9-difluoroIP. In contrast, 2-fluoroIP forms one major adduct spot with different retention behavior as compared with the adduct formed from IP. DNA from mice treated topically with IP-1,2-diol and IP-1,2-oxide was subjected to 32P-postlabeling analysis. IP-1,2-diol forms one major DNA adduct spot with mobility similar to that observed for the IP-DNA adduct. IP-1,2-oxide displayed an intense pattern of DNA adducts centered around the location of the IP-DNA adduct. No adducts were detected which had mobility similar to that formed from 2-fluoroIP. These results are consistent with IP undergoing metabolic activation at positions 7-10 either alone or in conjunction with dihydrodiol formation at the 1,2 position.
Effects of age on the induction of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive hepatic foci in rats were examined using a medium-term liver bioassay system (for carcinogens). F344 male rats aged 6, 26 and 46 weeks were initially given a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 200 mg/kg) and, beginning 2 weeks later, received 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), 0.05% phenobarbital (PB) or 1.3% acetaminophen (AAP) in the diet for 6 weeks. All animals were subjected to two-thirds hepatectomy 3 weeks after the DEN injection and were killed at week 8. Quantitative analysis of GST-P-positive foci revealed significantly (P less than 0.001) increased induction over control levels in terms of both numbers and areas for 2-AAF at all ages (6, 26 and 46 weeks), but especially in the 6-week-old case. In the PB- and AAP-treated groups, the respective enhancing and inhibitory influences were most pronounced in the animals aged 6 weeks, and were less marked in older rats. Thus, the response of F344 rats to the modifying effects of chemicals was age-dependent, the conclusion being drawn that young rats are more susceptible and therefore more appropriate for assessment of carcinogenic, promoting and inhibitory effects of chemicals.
Since 1988, the french non-governmental organisation Médecins Sans Frontières is running a control program of human african trypanosomiasis in the district of Moyo, North-Uganda. Between 1988 and 1993, more than 7,000 patients were diagnosed and treated. Since 1988, it has been noted that incidence of melarsoprol reaction had increased systematically between June and October of each year, indicating strong seasonal variation. In 1992 and 1993, two outbreaks of arsenical reactive encephalopathy (ARE) occurred in the sleeping sickness center of Adjumani. The incidence of ARE suddenly exceeded 10% of the patients treated by melarsoprol during August 1992 and September 1993. The onset of 80% of those "epidemic" cases, occurred between the 5th and the 11th day of treatment. Two retrospective studies were conducted in 1992 (75 cases) and in 1993 (51 cases). Among the risk factors studied, two appear to increase the risk of ARE: the prescription of thiabendazole to treat strongyloidiasis during the melarsoprol cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients. These observations suggest that exogenous co-factors could be involved in the occurrence of ARE. Recommendations were to avoid administration of diffusible anti-helminthic treatment during the cure, and to improve the general conditions of patients before the cure of melarsoprol.
A series of 2-benzylglutarimides (4) and their N-methyl analogues (5) were prepared according to the Topliss scheme for the selection of benzyl substituents to maximize anticonvulsant activity. A total of 22 such compounds were subjected to initial (phase I) screening in mice against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (scMet) and in the rotorod assay for neurotoxicity. From this series of test compounds, 10 were advanced to quantitative (phase II) testing. Of these, 2-(4-chlorobenzyl)glutarimide (4b) emerged as the most promising anticonvulsant drug candidate by demonstrating both good anti-scMet and anti-MES activity combined with low neurotoxicity after intraperitoneal administration in mice. In drug differentiation tests, 4b was also effective in nontoxic doses against seizures induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin, and strychnine. When compared with the clinically useful drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, valproate, and ethosuximide, 4b exhibited an overall pharmacological profile most closely resembling that of valproate.
A fit 36-year-old parturient received a general anaesthetic for manual removal of a retained placenta. She underwent rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia with suxamethonium, shortly followed by 10 mg of mivacurium. One hour later she had failed to establish adequate ventilation despite administration of drugs to reverse neuromuscular blockade. A provisional diagnosis of suxamethonium-related apnoea was made and her lungs were ventilated overnight on the Intensive Care Unit. Plasma cholinesterase levels at the time were reduced to one-third of normal, with normal dibucaine and fluoride numbers. One month later her levels were back within the reference range.
Sinomenine, a pure alkaloid isolated in Chinese medicine from the root of Sinomenium acutum, has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are gradually being recognized as critical mediators of disease pathogenesis via coordinated regulation of molecular effector pathways.
After colitis was induced in mice by instillation of 5% (w/v) 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), sinomenine at a dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg was orally administered once daily for 7 days. We evaluated body weight, survival rate, diarrhea score, histological score and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The mRNA and protein expression levels of miR-155, c-Maf, TNF-α and IFN-γ were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Sinomenine (100 or 200 mg/kg)-treated mice with TNBS-induced colitis were significantly improved in terms of body weight, survival rate, diarrhea score, histological score and MPO activity compared with untreated mice. Both dosages of sinomenine significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of c-Maf, TNF-α and IFN-γ, which elevated in TNBS-induced colitis. Furthermore, sinomenine at a dose of 200 mg/kg significantly decreased the level of miR-155 expression by 71% (p = 0.025) compared with untreated TNBS-induced colitis in mice.
Our study evaluated the effects and potential mechanisms of sinomenine in the anti-inflammatory response via miRNA-155 in mice with TNBS-induced colitis. Our findings suggest that sinomenine has anti-inflammatory effects on TNBS-induced colitis by down-regulating the levels of miR-155 and several related inflammatory cytokines.
A 25-year-old man admitted with severe upper torso trauma displayed masseter muscle spasm after suxamethonium given during resuscitation. Anaesthesia was initially maintained with intravenous agents during transfer and X-ray angiography. However, during surgery to correct a brachial artery injury, malignant hyperthermia was triggered when isoflurane was given, 2.5 h after the suxamethonium. He responded to treatment, including dantrolene administration. Peak serum and urine myoglobin were 12,947 micrograms.l-1 and 54,571 micrograms.l-1, respectively, while maximum serum creatinine kinase was 17,300 IU. The patient made an uneventful recovery and later proved positive for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility on muscle contracture tests.
The authors conducted a double-blind study to compare premedication with oral glycopyrrolate and oral atropine in prevention of bradycardia and hypotension during induction of anesthesia with halothane-N2O in 90 outpatient infants and children aged 1-18 mo who were randomized into three groups to receive either an oral placebo, oral atropine (0.02 mg/kg), or oral glycopyrrolate (0.05 mg/kg) approximately 1 h before induction of anesthesia. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were measured before drug administration, just before induction of anesthesia, and every minute until surgical stimulation occurred. Glycopyrrolate, at the dose used, was significantly less effective than atropine in attenuating bradycardia during induction; neither glycopyrrolate nor atropine altered the incidence or degree of hypotension. Antisialagogic activity and side effects were comparable, except for significantly more flushing with atropine.
