This paper presents the results of an intensive surveillance based on a network of general practitioners and following 200 patients treated by famotidine 40 mg per day during 6 to 8 weeks. Four patients with a previous experience of adverse reaction to another H2 antagonist did not relapse with famotidine. None interaction was reported with drugs such as beta-blockers, oral anticoagulants, theophylline, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists. Twenty four clinical side effects were reported; For 5 patients (2.5%) the treatment had to be stopped. The most common side effects were neurological. The results are compared with those of previously published studies.
This article presents a case of drug-facilitated sexual assault on a female intoxicated with flunitrazepam. The male assailant added flunitrazepam (1 mg) to the female's soft drink, and had sexual intercourse with her while her consciousness was impaired. The complainant did not recall the events due to benzodiazepine-induced anterograde amnesia. The use of flunitrazepam was uncovered when its major metabolite, 7-amino flunitrazepam, was detected in a urine specimen collected when the complainant attended hospital approximately one day after consuming the adulterated drink.
We present a case of accidental injection of tranexamic acid instead of bupivacaine during spinal anesthesia. One minute after intrathecal injection of 3.5 mL of solution, the patient developed myoclonus of his lower extremities. Accidental intrathecal injection of the wrong drug was suspected and a used ampule of tranexamic acid discovered in the trash can. The ampules of tranexamic acid (500 mg/5 mL) and bupivacaine (5 mg/mL, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were similar in appearance. General anesthesia was induced. Ten hours later, the patient developed myoclonus of his upper extremities and face. His polymyoclonus was successfully treated with phenytoin, sodium thiopental infusion, sodium valproate and supportive care of the hemodynamic, and respiratory systems. The patient's condition progressively improved to full recovery.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized at the cellular level by abnormal accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in lysosomal storage organelles. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) has been recently identified as a potential therapeutic target for NPC. LAL can be specifically inhibited by a variety of 3,4-disubstituted thiadiazole carbamates. An efficient synthesis of the C(3) oxygenated/C(4) aminated analogues has been developed that furnishes the products in high yields and high degrees of purity. Common intermediates can also be used for the synthesis of the C(3) carbon substituted derivatives. Herein we tested various thiadiazole carbamates, amides, esters, and ketones for inhibition of LAL. In addition, we tested a diverse selection of commercially available non-thiadiazole carbamates. Our studies show that, among the compounds examined herein, only thiadiazole carbamates are effective inhibitors of LAL. We present a mechanism for LAL inhibition by these compounds whereby LAL transiently carbamoylates the enzyme similarly to previously described inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by rivastigmine and other carbamates as well as acylation of various lipases by orlistat.
We investigated the effect of hyperprolactinemia induced by long-term domperidone treatment (10.0 mg/kg, single daily dose, ip) on striatal dopamine (DA) receptor sensitivity in male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g (N = 8). Domperidone treatment for 7 days continued to produce an increase in serum concentration of prolactin (PRL) from 17.3 +/- 2.2 to 33.1 +/- 7.3 and from 16.8 +/- 2.3 to 21.9 +/- 2.1, 2 and 72 h after domperidone withdrawal, respectively. Hyperprolactinemia induced by long-term domperidone treatment did not change binding sites (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) of [3H]-spiroperidol binding when compared to controls. These results show that hyperprolactinemia induced by long-term domperidone treatment does not effect the sensitivity of striatal DA receptors presumably because the effect of neuroleptic drugs is due to their interaction with the receptors and not to the concomitant hyperprolactinemia.
The antihypertensive efficacy of a new controlled-release preparation of nifedipine developed for once daily administration was investigated in comparison with a standard therapy with sustained-release nifedipine given twice daily in a randomised, open crossover trial. Twenty-two patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were enrolled. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed after a wash-out period and after a 3 weeks treatment with 40 mg controlled-release nifedipine once daily and 20 mg sustained-release nifedipine twice daily, respectively. ABPM data were evaluated by conventional linear analysis and by rhythm analysis. Both once daily and twice daily administration of nifedipine significantly reduced systolic blood pressure during the daytime and during the night when compared with baseline. The 24-h diastolic blood pressure was significantly decreased by both treatments, but only the once daily regimen significantly lowered both diastolic daytime and night-time means. Comparing systolic and diastolic blood pressures after both treatments, however, no significant differences were obtained. Both nifedipine treatments did neither greatly modify the circadian blood pressure pattern nor reflexly increase heart rate. In conclusion, once daily application of the controlled-release formulation of nifedipine resulted in a consistent and significant blood pressure reduction. Once daily and twice daily medications of nifedipine were about equally effective in lowering the elevated blood pressures.
This study compares the chronic toxicity of two anthracyclines--daunorubicin and doxorubicin, commonly used for induction of anthracycline cardiomyopathy in the rabbit model. Such a comparative study has not been published until now. Both drugs were administered intravenously to male Chinchilla rabbits in doses at 3 mg/kg (50 mg/m2) once weekly for 10 weeks. Selected biochemical, haematological and cardiovascular parameters and body weights were regularly monitored; additionally, a histological evaluation of heart, kidney and liver was performed at the end of the experiment. In the daunorubicin group, there were marked signs of the progressive development of heart failure, like the significant increases of the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time index values (up to 134%)--and histological changes within the myocardium were also observed. On the other hand, the 10-week doxorubicin administration did not cause these changes that are typical for heart injury. Haematotoxicity, manifested particularly by aplastic anaemia, was apparent in both the experimental groups. Significant body weight loss (by 45.2%) and high premature mortality (100% versus 36.4%) reflected a greater general toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin in comparison with daunorubicin. Further studies are necessary to find a possible explanation for these findings.
The association between anabolic androgenic steroids and liver tumors was first noted in patients with Fanconi's anemia (FA). The hypotheses which led to this review were as follows: (1) androgen-treated individuals who do not have FA are also at risk of liver tumors; (2) parenteral as well as oral androgens may be responsible for liver tumors; (3) FA patients develop liver tumors after smaller and briefer androgen exposure than non-FA individuals; (4) the risk of hepatic neoplasms may depend on the specific androgen. Medline and Web of Science were searched for all cases of liver tumors associated with androgens. Information from individual cases was entered into a spreadsheet and descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Thirty-six FA cases and 97 non-FA cases with both nonhematologic disorders and acquired aplastic anemia (non-FA AA) were identified. The most common androgens were oxymetholone, methyltestosterone, and danazol. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were more often associated with oxymetholone and methyltestosterone, while adenomas were associated with danazol. Tumors were reported in six patients who received only parenteral and not oral androgens. FA patients were younger than non-FA patients when androgen use was initiated, and the FA patients developed tumors at younger ages. Non-AA patients were treated with androgens for longer periods of time, compared with FA and non-FA AA patients. All patients on anabolic androgenic steroids are at risk of liver tumors, regardless of underlying diagnosis. The magnitude of the risk cannot be determined from currently available data, because the number of patients receiving androgens is unknown.
A total of 283 epithelial ovarian cancer families from the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) were screened for coding sequence changes and large genomic alterations (rearrangements and deletions) in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Deleterious BRCA1 mutations were identified in 104 families (37%) and BRCA2 mutations in 25 families (9%). Of the 104 BRCA1 mutations, 12 were large genomic alterations; thus this type of change represented 12% of all BRCA1 mutations. Six families carried a previously described exon 13 duplication, known to be a UK founder mutation. The remaining six BRCA1 genomic alterations were previously unreported and comprised five deletions and an amplification of exon 15. One of the 25 BRCA2 mutations identified was a large genomic deletion of exons 19-20. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations correlated with the extent of ovarian and breast cancer in families. Of 37 families containing more than two ovarian cancer cases and at least one breast cancer case with diagnosis at less than 60 years of age, 30 (81%) had a BRCA1/2 mutation. The mutation prevalence was appreciably less in families without breast cancer; mutations were found in only 38 out of 141 families (27%) containing two ovarian cancer cases only, and in 37 out of 59 families (63%) containing three or more ovarian cancer cases. These data indicate that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the major susceptibility genes for ovarian cancer but that other susceptibility genes may exist. Finally, it is likely that these data will be of clinical importance for individuals in families with a history of epithelial ovarian cancer, in providing accurate estimates of their disease risks.
Losartan is the first of a new category of drug that inhibits angiotensin II (ANG II) AT1 receptors antagonists. This drug lowers blood pressure by inhibiting the activity of ANG II and reduces proteinuria and progression of chronic renal failure (CRF). It seems therefore an extremely interesting drug. Aim of this study is to describe 3 cases of acute renal failure (ARF), occurred during therapy with losartan. None of the patients showed renal arteries stenosis or other predisposing factors for the development of ARF. In conclusion, we want pointed out that losartan could affect renal function in a similar way as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). We suggested that use of losartan in risk situations, like old age, preexiting CRF, stenosis of renal arteries, solitary kidney and diuretic therapy, should be carefully monitored as well as that of ACE I.
Stat4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) can be activated by specific cytokines, such as IL-12, IFN-alpha, and IL-2. Since IL-12 has been implicated in tumor surveillance and cancer treatment, we hypothesized that its signaling mediator, Stat4, may repress tumor growth. Mice lacking Stat4 allowed us to directly assess the role of Stat4 in tumor surveillance. Lymphomas were chemically induced by MNU (N-methyl-N-nitrosourea) injection in Stat4-deficient or wild-type control mice. At the time of termination of the experiment 16 weeks after injection, 78% of homozygous Stat4-deficient mice had developed thymic lymphomas. This tumor induction was dramatically higher than in heterozygous (14%) and wild-type controls (14%). Lymphoma development occurred 5 weeks earlier in homozygous knockout mice than in other genotypes. Mice bearing tumors were fragile and had an increased death rate in the early stages of the experiment. The tumors displayed a very aggressive phenotype with metastases in multiple organs. Therefore, the loss of Stat4 predisposes mice to tumor induction and demonstrates crucial roles of Stat4 in the prevention of tumors.
Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin often found in cereals and agricultural products. There is unequivocal evidence of renal carcinogenicity of OTA in male rats, although the mechanism of action is unknown. At present, available data support an epigenetic mechanism (DNA non-reactive) resulting from oxidative stress and cytotoxicity, because a direct OTA interaction with DNA has not been demonstrated. Genotoxic mechanism (DNA-reactive vs. DNA non-reactive) may have implications on human risk assessment. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to identify biological pathways modulated by OTA in vitro in a human renal cell line (HK-2) to contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism of OTA toxicity. For that purpose, cells were exposed to 50 microM OTA during 6 and 24 h, and gene expression profiles were analyzed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 A 2.0 Gene Chips. Under the same experimental conditions, genotoxicity was evaluated by the modified comet assay using FPG and Endo III to detect oxidative DNA damage, and intracellular ROS level by the H(2)DCF assay. After 6 h, with slight cytotoxicity (83% survival), genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport chain were up-regulated; and after 24 h, with a more pronounced cytotoxicity (51% survival), genes implicated in oxidative stress response were also up-regulated. Increase in intracellular ROS level and oxidative DNA damage was evident at both exposure times being more pronounced with high cytotoxicity. On the contrary, up-regulation of genes implicated in DNA damage response, as cell cycle control or apoptosis, was not detected at any exposure time. In conclusion, these results support a DNA non-reactive mechanism of OTA genotoxicity.
Arsenic in drinking water, a mixture of arsenite and arsenate, is associated with increased skin and other cancers in Asia and Latin America, but not the United States. Arsenite alone in drinking water does not cause skin cancers in experimental animals; therefore, it is not a complete carcinogen in skin. We recently showed that low concentrations of arsenite enhanced the tumorigenicity of solar UV irradiation in hairless mice, suggesting arsenic cocarcinogenesis with sunlight in skin cancer and perhaps with different carcinogenic partners for lung and bladder tumors. Cocarcinogenic mechanisms could include blocking DNA repair, stimulating angiogenesis, altering DNA methylation patterns, dysregulating cell cycle control, induction of aneuploidy and blocking apoptosis. Arsenicals are documented clastogens but not strong mutagens, with weak mutagenic activity reported at highly toxic concentrations of inorganic arsenic. Previously, we showed that arsenite, but not monomethylarsonous acid (MMA[III]), induced delayed mutagenesis in HOS cells. Here, we report new data on the mutagenicity of the trivalent methylated arsenic metabolites MMA(III) and dimethylarsinous acid [DMA(III)] at the gpt locus in Chinese hamster G12 cells. Both methylated arsenicals seemed mutagenic with apparent sublinear dose responses. However, significant mutagenesis occurred only at highly toxic concentrations of MMA(III). Most mutants induced by MMA(III) and DMA(III) exhibited transgene deletions. Some non-deletion mutants exhibited altered DNA methylation. A critical discussion of cell survival leads us to conclude that clastogenesis occurs primarily at highly cytotoxic arsenic concentrations, casting further doubt as to whether a genotoxic mode of action (MOA) for arsenicals is supportable.
Preliminary results from the first 21 patients of a group of 30 with International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage II-IV epithelial ovarian carcinoma and anaemia are reported. Patients entered this open-label, comparative-group, out-patient study and were randomized to receive conventional support alone (control patients) or recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in addition to conventional support for 6 months. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of r-HuEPO on the anaemia induced by platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients randomized to r-HuEPO therapy received 300 U/kg subcutaneously 3 times weekly in addition to conventional chemotherapy. All patients underwent regular haematological monitoring. One patient developed a deep venous thrombosis after 17 doses of r-HuEPO; it was thought that this event may have been related to therapy and the patient was withdrawn from the study. Three other withdrawals occurred after 11, 15 and 40 doses of r-HuEPO because of progressive anaemia, metoclopramide-induced skin rash and change of chemotherapy, respectively. In the 21 patients analysed to date, there was a notable reduction in blood transfusion requirements during the 6 months of chemotherapy and an improvement in mean serial haemoglobin concentrations in patients on r-HuEPO compared with the control group. In conclusion, r-HuEPO has the potential for reducing haematological toxicity in patients with ovarian carcinoma receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. Also, r-HuEPO may allow modest dosage increments in chemotherapy or the addition of abdominopelvic radiotherapy.
Sepsis remains the most important cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients and is an independent predictor of poor outcome. The administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to animals reproduces most of the clinical features of sepsis, including AKI, a condition associated with renal cellular dysfunction and apoptosis. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a well known cytoprotective multifunctional hormone, which exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic and angiogenic effects in several tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of EPO renoprotection through the expression of the EPO receptor (EPO-R) and the modulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in LPS-induced AKI. Male inbred Balb/c mice were divided in four experimental groups: Control, LPS (8 mg/kg i.p.), EPO (3000 IU sc) and LPS+EPO. Assessment of renal function, histological examination, TUNEL in situ assay, immunohistochemistry and Western blottings of caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-xL, EPO-R and Cytochrome c were performed at 24h post treatment. LPS+EPO treatment significantly improved renal function and ameliorated histopathological injury when compared to the LPS treated group. Results showed that EPO treatment attenuates renal tubular apoptosis through: (a) the overexpression of EPO-R in tubular interstitial cells, (b) the reduction of Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, (c) the inhibition Cytochrome c release into the cytosol and (d) the decrease of the active caspase-3 expression. This study suggests that EPO exerts renoprotection on an experimental model of LPS-induced AKI. EPO induced renoprotection involves an anti-apoptotic effect through the expression of EPO-R and the regulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
Quinine-induced reversible hearing impairment at the frequencies of 1000 and 2000 Hz was investigated in healthy volunteers to analyze the plasma concentration-effect relationship of the drug. Six subjects were given two identical oral doses of quinine and a constant rate infusion of quinine over 6 hours (15 mg.kg-1) on three separate occasions. A simple pharmacodynamic model, E = k.C gamma (in which E is effect, k is a proportionality constant, C is drug concentration, and the exponent gamma is a fitting parameter), was found to describe well the relationship between hearing impairment and quinine concentrations in a hypothetical effect compartment. No statistical differences were found in the estimated parameters when the three dosings were compared, indicating that quinine-induced hearing impairment is independent of route of administration. The first-order rate constant (keo), linking plasma concentrations to the concentrations in the effect compartment, was (mean +/- SD) 0.71 +/- 0.19 and 0.99 +/- 0.37 hr-1 for 1000 and 2000 Hz, respectively. The corresponding values of k were 0.15 +/- 0.10 and 0.12 +/- 0.19 and the values of gamma were 2.13 +/- 0.57 and 3.44 +/- 1.04 for 1000 and 2000 Hz, respectively. Effect was also analyzed by semiparametric pharmacodynamic modeling, which gave results comparable to those obtained with the link model. We conclude that a simple power function is a reliable pharmacodynamic model for describing quinine-induced hearing impairment in healthy subjects.
The ability of the alpha adrenoreceptor antagonists phentolamine and yohimbine to antagonize cocaine-induced hepatotoxicity was determined in phenobarbital-induced B6C3/F1 mice. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by the histologic extent of necrosis, incidence of latent lethality and increases in serum alanine aminotransferase activity. The depression of hepatic glutathione levels also were measured. The administration of a single 5-mg/kg dose of phentolamine antagonized the decrease in glutathione levels and the elevation of aminotransferase activity caused by a 60-mg/kg dose of cocaine. Similar results were obtained in mice pretreated with the alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine. Whereas the duration of antagonism could be extended by administering a 30-mg/kg dose of yohimbine, the magnitude of the antagonism was not increased. In contrast to the experiments with the larger dose, multiple hourly doses of 2.5 mg/kg of yohimbine increased both the duration of antagonism and the magnitude of protection against the hepatotoxicity produced by cocaine. Yohimbine pretreatment reduced cocaine-induced latent lethality by 50%, but did not alter the time to lethality. The results of these experiments indicate that the alpha adrenoreceptor antagonist reduces the toxicity of cocaine rather than merely delaying its time of onset. This effect does not appear to result from an inhibition of the toxic metabolite(s) of cocaine, as a 10-fold molar excess of yohimbine failed to antagonize lipid peroxidation caused by in vitro incubation of cocaine with hepatic microsomes. Additional experiments in mice whose liver metabolism had not been induced by prior pretreatment with phenobarbital revealed that 60 mg/kg of cocaine lowered glutathione but was not hepatotoxic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To evaluate the possibility of predicting the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, we performed quantitative assessment of the early kinetics of iodine-123 beta-methyl-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (I-123 BMIPP) by means of dynamic myocardial SPECT.
Thirty-six patients with various malignancies were examined. I-123 BMIPP dynamic myocardial SPECT was performed before chemotherapy, after chemotherapy, or both. Immediately after the injection of I-123 BMIPP (111 MBq), 30-second dynamic SPECT data were acquired successively for 15 minutes. The left ventricular (LV) myocardium was divided into 8 segments in short-axial and vertical slices. By using the time-activity curve (TAC) of each myocardial segment [Mo(t)] as an output function and the TAC of the LV cavity [B(t)] as an input function, the Rutland equation, Mo(t)/B(t)= F + K Integral of(B(t)dt/B(t)), was used as a means of assessing all segments.
Mo(t)/B(t) showed a good linear correlation with Integral of(B(t)dt/B(t)) from 30 seconds to 4 minutes in all 456 segments. The mean K value of 8 LV segments was significantly lower after chemotherapy than before chemotherapy (0.071+/-0.019 [n = 21] vs. 0.095+/-0.025 [n = 36], P<.001). In 21 patients in whom dynamic SPECT was performed both before and after chemotherapy, the mean K values of left ventricle showed a significant decrease, from 0.101+/-0.024 to 0.071 +/-0.019 (P<.0001). The fractional change in the value of K after chemotherapy showed a significant linear correlation with the administered dose of doxorubicin (r = 0.648, P<.002).
I-123 BMIPP dynamic myocardial SPECT may be clinically useful, because it permits the early detection of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
The grape and wine polyphenol resveratrol exerts cardiovascular benefits but evidence from randomized human clinical trials is very limited. We investigated dose-depending effects of a resveratrol-containing grape supplement on stable patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated according to currently accepted guidelines for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
In a triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, one-year follow-up, 3-arm pilot clinical trial, 75 stable-CAD patients received 350 mg/day of placebo, resveratrol-containing grape extract (grape phenolics plus 8 mg resveratrol) or conventional grape extract lacking resveratrol during 6 months, and a double dose for the following 6 months. Changes in circulating inflammatory and fibrinolytic biomarkers were analyzed. Moreover, the transcriptional profiling of inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was explored using microarrays and functional gene expression analysis.
After 1 year, in contrast to the placebo and conventional grape extract groups, the resveratrol-containing grape extract group showed an increase of the anti-inflammatory serum adiponectin (9.6 %, p = 0.01) and a decrease of the thrombogenic plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) (-18.6 %, p = 0.05). In addition, 6 key inflammation-related transcription factors were predicted to be significantly activated or inhibited, with 27 extracellular-space acting genes involved in inflammation, cell migration and T-cell interaction signals presenting downregulation (p < 0.05) in PBMCs. No adverse effects were detected in relation to the study products.
Chronic daily consumption of a resveratrol-containing grape nutraceutical could exert cardiovascular benefits in stable-CAD patients treated according to current evidence-based standards, by increasing serum adiponectin, preventing PAI-1 increase and inhibiting atherothrombotic signals in PBMCs.
Anesthetic indices for methoxyflurane, enflurane, and isoflurane in oxygen and halothane in nitrous oxide and oxygen (50:50), were determined in rats using measurements of heart and brain concentrations of the volatile agents at the endpoints of anesthesia, respiratory arrest and cardiac failure. The indices related respiratory arrest to anesthesia (respiratory index-A1r), cardiac failure to anesthesia (cardiac index-AIc) and respiratory arrest to cardiac failure (cardiorespiratory index-AIcr). Isoflurane had a significantly higher AIr (3.1) and AIc (5.7) than enflurane (AIr 1.8, AIc 3.3), methoxyflurane (AIr 2.2, AIc 3.7) and halothane in nitrous oxide and oxygen (AIr 2.4, AIc 3.7). These indices were also higher than those previously determined for halothane (AIr 2.3, AIc 3.0). Isoflurane had a higher AIcr (1.9) than halothane (1.6). Enflurane had a significantly lower AIr (1.8) than any of the other agents studied. These findings suggested a greater margin of safety for isoflurane, especially with respect to the heart, and a greater potential for respiratory depression for enflurane than for the other agents. Nitrous oxide decreased the amount of halothane necessary to produce anesthesia, but also that needed to produce respiratory arrest or cardiac failure. The addition of nitrous oxide, therefore, did not significantly enhance the overall safety of halothane anesthesia with respect to potential respiratory or cardiac depression.
An asthmatic patient with corticosteroid treatment for 45 years presented with slowly progressive limb muscle atrophy. His muscle symptoms were involved in four limbs and tongue, and deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated. Biopsied muscle pathology indicated the presence of neurogenic muscular atrophy in combination with corticosteroid myopathy. Furthermore, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) was prominently increased in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. An aerobic exercise test demonstrated remarkable serum lactate elevation, which was attenuated by the administration of coenzyme Q10. These findings are consistent with the assumption that long-term corticosteroid administration potentially induces not only myopathy but also motor neuron involvement as in mitochondrial diseases.
Cardiac and noncardiac side effects were studied in 293 consecutive patients referred for nonexercise stress thallium imaging with intravenous dipyridamole. Six minutes after the initiation of infusion, there was a mean 9-beat/min increase in heart rate and a mean 12-mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure. The largest increase in heart rate exceeded 20 beats/min in only 13% of patients and the largest decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeded 20 mm Hg in 31%. Noncardiac side effects were headache (11%), lightheadedness or dizziness (5%) and nausea (4%). Only 9 patients required intravenous aminophylline for relief of noncardiac side effects: severe headache in 7 and nausea in 2. Cardiac side effects included chest pain in 76 patients (26%), of whom 70% were given aminophylline for relief of symptoms. Sixty patients (20%) had ischemic ST-segment depression and 56 (19%) had arrhythmias (ventricular in 50 and atrial in 6). There were no deaths, myocardial infarctions or sustained arrhythmias due to dipyridamole administration. Among 62 patients also undergoing cardiac catheterization, side effects except for arrhythmias were unrelated to the number of vessels with coronary artery disease. Intravenous dipyridamole is safe for nonexercise stress testing and has few serious side effects. However, the possibility of ischemia requires careful selection of patients and monitoring of vital signs and the electrocardiogram during the test.
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an important modulatory neuropeptide that regulates several physiological systems, including the activity of sensory neurons. We evaluated whether activation of the NPY Y1 receptor could modulate the activity of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors in trigeminal ganglia and dental pulp. We tested this hypothesis by measuring capsaicin-stimulated calcitonin gene-related peptide release (CGRP) as a measure of nociceptor activity. Capsaicin-evoked CGRP release was inhibited by 50% (p < 0.05) in trigeminal ganglia and by 26% (p < 0.05) in dental pulp when tissues were pre-treated with [Leu(31),Pro(34)]NPY. The Y1 receptor was found to co-localize with the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 in trigeminal ganglia. These results demonstrate that activation of the Y1 receptor results in the inhibition of the activity of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors in the trigeminal ganglia and dental pulp. These findings are relevant to the physiological modulation of dental nociceptors by endogenous NPY and demonstrate an important novel analgesic target for the treatment of dental pain.
Generalized and partial seizures with secondary generalization were observed during ifosfamide-mesna (IFO) treatment in a patient with lung epidermoid carcinoma. Seizures appeared in a stereotyped manner on the 3rd of the 4th and 6th day of treatment with IFO. Partially resolutive confusion was observed after the last cure. Brain CTS were normal. The responsibility of IFO is considered in the development of these neurological toxic manifestations.
We report a case of central nervous system toxicity induced by ropivacaine following a brachial block at the humeral canal. Forty millilitres 0.75% ropivacaine (4.28 mg.kg-1) were used uneventfully, with slow injections and negative intermittent aspirations. Fifteen minutes later, the patient presented two episodes of generalised convulsions treated by diazepam, 20 mg. The total venous ropivacaine concentration measured two hours after the block was 2.3 mg.l-1.
