Hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes are down-regulated during inflammation. In this study, an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease was subjected to characterization of hepatic P450 expression under inflammatory conditions. Rats were treated intracolonically with 100 mg/kg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 30% ethanol, and homogenates of colonic mucosa and hepatic microsomes of the rats were prepared. The colitis was accompanied by appearance of higher levels of portal endotoxin, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide metabolites and decreases in contents and activities for hepatic CYP3A2, CYP2C11, and, to a lesser extent, CYP1A2 and CYP2E1. Nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, protected rats with TNBS-induced colitis (TNBS-colitis) against the down-regulation of hepatic CYP3A2. Polymyxin B, which neutralizes endotoxin, curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties, and gadolinium chloride, which inactivates macrophages, attenuated the down-regulation of CYP3A2. Similar effects were observed in other P450s such as CYP2C11, but the agents were less effective in attenuating the down-regulation. Our data suggest that endogenous substances leaked from damaged colon in the rats with TNBS-colitis activate Kupffer cells, leading to down-regulation of hepatic P450s with differential susceptibility to the inflammatory stimuli. The colitis model, instead of exogenous administration of lipopolysaccharide or cytokines, could be applied to the study on mechanisms for altered hepatic P450 expression and other liver functions under mild inflammatory conditions.
Social and emotional behaviors are known to be sensitive to both developmental iron deficiency (ID) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene polymorphisms. In this study, male rhesus monkey infants deprived of dietary iron in utero were compared with iron sufficient (IS) controls (n = 10/group). Half of each group had low MAOA activity genotypes and half had high MAOA activity genotypes. A series of social response tests were conducted at 3-14 months of age. MAOA genotype influenced attention to a video of aggressive behavior, emotional expression (fear, grimace and sniff) in the social intruder test, social actions (displacement, grooming) in the social dyad test, and aggressive responses to a threatening picture. Interactions between MAOA and prenatal ID were seen in response to the aggressive video, in temperament ratings, in affiliative behavior in the social dyad test, in cortisol response in the social buffering test and in response to a social intruder and to pictures with social and nonsocial themes. In general, the effects of ID were dependent on MAOA genotype in terms of both direction and size of the effect. Nutrition/genotype interactions may shed new light on behavioral consequences of nutritional deprivation during brain development.
Analgesic nephropathy occurs most commonly in Australia, where it is the second most frequent cause of renal failure. Whilst the reasons for widespread abuse of analgesics are poorly understood, the consequences of abuse are now well recognised. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the analgesic syndrome and on the accelerated atherosclerosis seen in these patients. Attention in the article is drawn to ways in which the analgesic syndrome can be recognised and analgesic abuse ceased. A therapeutic approach is presented which allows the successful withdrawal of analgesic in almost all patients.
The combination of spironolactone with an ACE inhibitor for patients with heart failure may cause severe hyperkalemia. We report the case of a female patient, who developed hyperkalemic (11.4 mmol/l) cardiac arrest probably induced by combined spironolactone and ACE-inhibitor therapy. She was treated successfully by hemodiafiltration under on-going resuscitation which resulted in restoration of spontaneous circulation within 30 min of starting CPR. She was discharged 2 weeks later without any residual neurological effects.
Nineteen rats were parathyroidectomized by electrocauterization, resulting in pronounced hypocalcaemia. Seven of these rats were then given vitamin D3 in a dose causing hypercalcaemia, while 7 received a dose which normalized serum calcium and 5 received no vitamin D. Ten further animals were sham-operated and were not given any extra vitamin D. The experimental period was 16 weeks. No significant differences in serum gastrin values were found between the different groups. Quantitative studies of the antral gastrin cells showed no difference in the number of gastrin cells per unit volume or unit segment between the different groups of vitamin-D-treated animals and sham-operated animals. However, the number of gastrin cells per unit segment was significantly higher in the hypocalcaemic animals than in the sham-operated animals, as a result of an increase in mucosal thickness. The amount of antral mucosal gastrin did not differ between the different groups. Thus the results of this study indicate that experimentally induced hypercalcaemia in parathyroidectomized rats does not influence the serum gastrin, the number of gastrin cells or antral gastrin.
We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 2 patients. BMT was used to treat severe aplastic anemia which was caused by gold in one case and D-penicillamine in the other. In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants (representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy, respectively), the RA in each case has been completely quiescent. Although short term remission of severe RA following BMT has been reported, these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available. This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive synovitis.
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are useful for the treatment of postoperative pain, but there is continuing concern about adverse effects on renal function. We studied the renal effects of ketorolac in an animal model using Fischer 344 rats undergoing isoflurane anesthesia and laparotomy. Treatment groups--control (C), ketorolac (5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) (K), large-dose ketorolac (15 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) (KH), dehydration-ketorolac (5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) (DK), gentamicin (20 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) (G), and gentamicin (20 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) with ketorolac (5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) (GK)--each comprised 10 animals. Renal function was assessed before laparotomy and after 3 treatment days using concurrent paraaminohippurate and iothalamate clearances, respectively, to estimate renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate, and by measuring serum and urine electrolytes, osmolality, urea, and creatinine. A significant increase in serum potassium was found in the GK and DK groups. There were no major changes in renal function in the C, K, KH, and DK groups. Mild renal dysfunction was found in the G group. We found severe and consistent changes in renal function, accompanied by severe, widespread histological changes of acute tubular necrosis, in the GK group. In this postoperative rat model, the combination of ketorolac and gentamicin was deleterious to renal function.
We examined the renal effects of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ketorolac. Renal function was measured in rats before and after surgery and 3 days' drug administration; the kidneys studied by using microscopy. Only ketorolac plus the antibiotic gentamicin produced marked changes in kidney function and structure.
Aqueous anemic mice kidney extracts (MKE) were assessed colony-promoting activity (CPA) of hematopoietic progenitor cells in serum-free cultures stimulated by interleukin-3 and erythropoietin (Epo). Mice with hemolytic anemia followed by phenylhydorazine (PHZ) injection for 3 days showed a decrease in the hematocrit (25.4%) and an increase in serum Epo by 14-fold of the control on day 3 after the treatment. At 3 days, the total number of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow of PHZ mice decreased by 67% of the control, while these cells in the spleen increased to 22-fold of the control on day 3 and 55-fold on day 6. A significant increase in CPA was observed in MKE prepared from PHZ mice kidneys. Additionally, bone marrow suppressive anemia induced by 5-fluorouracil resulted in enhanced CPA the same as for PHZ mice, but in contrast, anemia with suppression of Epo-production due to nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin caused a decrease in CPA. These results suggest that CPA in MKE correlates with hematopoietic conditions, and may have a definite role in hematopoiesis through the function of the kidney.
Elevations of creatine kinase have been described, but have been associated with high doses of albuterol given by oral or intravenous routes. Most reports have described an elevation of MB isoenzyme fraction from the heart. Elevation of creatine kinase-MM isoenzyme from skeletal muscle rarely appears to be associated with the use of inhaled albuterol.
A patient is discussed who presented with severe myalgias and was found to have elevated creatine kinase-MM from albuterol metered dose inhaler.
Clinical status, creatine kinase levels, electromyography, enzyme stains, histopathologic and lactate challenge studies were done to evaluate the status of the patient.
Without exercise or use of albuterol, creatine kinase-MM levels were normal. With the use of albuterol, whether inhaled or by oral therapy, the creatine kinase-MM level increased. When combined with exercise, higher levels occurred. Workup was normal except histopathology revealed a myopathy.
Patients with myalgias from albuterol with elevated creatine kinase-MM fraction should be investigated for possible myopathy.
A child with developmental delay and epilepsy developed glucosuria approximately 16 months after starting valproic acid therapy. Laboratory evaluation revealed global defects in proximal tubule function consistent with the De Toni-Debré-Fanconi syndrome. Discontinuation of valproate led to complete recovery 5 months later. Review of previously reported cases indicates that this complication is unique to children and reversible when the medication is discontinued.
CGP 37849, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was administered repeatedly (10 mg/kg po, twice daily for 14 days) to male Wistar rats. In behavioral studies it did not affect the locomotor activity, but enhanced the d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. Biochemical studies of the concentrations of dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in the rat cerebral cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens showed that only the concentrations of DOPAC (an increase) and NA (a decrease) were changed in the nucleus accumbens. Repeated administration of CGP 37849 increased the density of dopamine D1 receptors labelled with [3H]-SCH 23390 in the rat striatum, but not in the limbic forebrain, having exerted no effect on the density of D2 receptors labelled with [3H]-spiperone. The density of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors, labelled with [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol, respectively, were unchanged in the cerebral cortex. The obtained results indicate that in some experimental paradigms CGP 37849 given repeatedly produces effects similar to those of typical antidepressant drugs.
Rhabdomyolysis has been the theme in medical literature for the last fifty years. In these last decades, with statins being used in primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention events, this theme returns and statins are now pointed as the trigger to this almost always fatal complication. Rhabdomyolysis due to statins administration occurs mainly in association with other drugs. Our case reports on a patient with fatal statin-induced rhabdomyolysis whose medical history included diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
Intravenous magnesium supplementation is often used to control cardiac arrhythmias and coronary artery vasospasm resulting from disturbances of magnesium homeostasis after coronary artery bypass surgery. Many such patients also require inotropic drug support of depressed myocardial function. However, increased serum magnesium concentrations directly depress cardiac contractility in animals and may interfere with catecholamine actions. To determine whether small intravenous doses of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) interfere with the cardiotonic actions of epinephrine, we examined the hemodynamic effects of MgSO4 and epinephrine infusion in 17 cardiac surgical patients on their 1st postoperative day in a prospective, controlled study. In 11 patients, infusion of MgSO4 (7-mg.kg-1 bolus followed by 10 mg.kg-1.h-1 as a continuous infusion) increased serum magnesium concentrations by 44% (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM] of 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mM; P less than 0.01) but had no significant effect on heart rate; mean arterial, central venous, or pulmonary arterial occlusion pressures; or cardiac output. Epinephrine infusion (30 ng.kg-1.min-1) significantly increased cardiac index (2.7 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.21.min-1.m-2; P less than 0.05); this effect was not altered by MgSO4 administration (n = 11). However, MgSO4 significantly blunted epinephrine's hypertensive action and prevented a significant increase in mean arterial pressure during concurrent MgSO4-epinephrine administration. Six placebo control patients were given two sequential infusions of epinephrine separated by a placebo infusion to rule out an effect of time on the hemodynamic response to epinephrine. Mean arterial pressure and cardiac index responses to epinephrine were identical before and after placebo infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To investigate the influence of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmid against gene survivin (mU(6)/survivin) on survivin mRNA expression and chemosensitivity to paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells OVCAR3.
OVCAR3 cells were transfected with plasmid pEGFPC(2) formulated with lipofectamine 2000 at different concentrations. The transfection efficiency was examined by flow cytometry. The expression of survivin mRNA of OVCAR3 cells after transfection with the plasmid mU(6)/survivin with the high efficiency ratio was observed by RT-PCR. The effect of the plasmid on the cell cycle and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The chemosensitivities of transfected cells to paclitaxel were determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT).
The optimal transfection efficiency was obtained when pEGFPC(2): lipofectamine 2000 was 1: 2. Compared with the non-transfected groups, 0.81 +/- 0.05, the mRNA of survivin in OVCAR3 cells was reduced clearly after transfection with mU(6)/survivin, 0.26 +/- 0.04. shRNA reduced the expression level of survivin mRNA to 32% of non-transfected groups (P < 0.01). The apoptotic rate of survivin shRNA group reached (31.9 +/- 1.2)%, which was much higher than those of non-transfected (4.9 +/- 0.7)% and lip alone groups (5.6 +/- 0.5)% (P = 0.000). Cell cycle analysis showed that survivin shRNA induced accumulation of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase with a decrease of cells in G(2)/M phase after being cultured for 24 hours compared with non-transfected group (P < 0.01). MTT results showed that the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC(50)) of paclitaxel in non-transfected, lip alone and survivin shRNA transfected groups was (0.305 +/- 0.032), (0.157 +/- 0.031), and (0.019 +/- 0.001) micromol/L respectively. Compared with non-transfected group, shRNA increased the chemosensitivity of OVCAR3 cells to paclitaxel by 16 fold (P = 0.000).
Sequence specific shRNA targeting survivin can effectively suppress the expression of survivin mRNA and enhance the chemosensitivity to paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells significantly.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that endotoxin plays an important role in the development and progression of hepatic cirrhosis. However, there is no effective remedy for the prevention and treatment of intestinal endotoxemia. Taurine has been reported to have beneficial effects on endotoxemia. Oats have been shown to absorb intestinal toxins and increase excretion of intestinal toxins. The present study was to investigate whether a combination of taurine and oat has an additive inhibitory effect on endotoxin release in a rat liver ischemia/reperfusion model. Our results showed that the combination of taurine (300mgkg(-1)d(-1)) and oat fiber (15gkg(-1)d(-1)) significantly reduced endotoxin levels in the portal vein by 36.3% when compared to the control group (0.168+/-0.035Eu/ml in the treatment group vs 0.264+/-0.058Eu/ml in the control group, P<0.01). The treatment of taurine (300mgkg(-1)d(-1)) and oat fiber (15gkg(-1)d(-1)) induced 21.5% and 18.4% reduction in endotoxin levels, respectively, when compared to the control group (P<0.05). We conclude that the combination of taurine and oat fiber achieved an additive inhibitory effect on intestinal endotoxin release, which might be an effective approach for the treatment of intestinal endotoxemia.
Previous studies have indicated that genetic factors substantially affect development of substance use disorders, including methamphetamine dependence. Prodynorphin (PDYN) is an opioid peptide precursor that yields dynorphins, endogenous kappa opioid-receptor agonists that play important roles in substance abuse. A physiologically active polymorphism of 1-4 repeats of a 68-bp element in the promoter region of the PDYN gene has been identified. We analyzed this polymorphism of the PDYN gene by a case-control association study in 143 patients with methamphetamine dependence and 209 healthy controls in the Japanese population. A 3- or 4-repeat allele in the PDYN gene promoter was found significantly more frequently in patients with methamphetamine dependence than in controls (chi(2)=9.45, p=0.0021). A 3- or 4-repeat allele in the PDYN gene promoter, which was shown to produce significantly higher transcription activity of the PDYN gene than a 1- or 2-repeat allele, is a genetic risk factor for development of methamphetamine dependence (odds ratio: 1.83, 95% CI=1.24-2.68).
Central effects of SL 82.0715, an antagonist of polyamine site of the NMDA receptor complex, was studied in male Albino-Swiss mice. SL 82.0715, in doses which given alone were inactive in electroshock-induced seizures, potentiated the anticonvulsant effects of CGP 37849. In normal mice, SL 82.0715 decreased the spontaneous locomotor activity, did not affect the locomotor hyperactivity induced by MK-801 and attenuated CGP 37849-induced locomotor hyperactivity. The D-amphetamine locomotor hyperactivity was also antagonized by SL 82.0715. SL 82.0715 did not significantly change the locomotor activity in monoamine-depleted mice (treated with reserpine + alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine). When administered together with clonidine, SL 82.0715 increased the locomotor activity in monoamine-depleted mice but this effect did not reach the level of statistical significance. SL 82.0715 did not change the locomotor activity induced by joint administration of clonidine and MK-801 or clonidine and CGP 37849, in monoamine-depleted mice. The locomotor hyperactivity evoked by L-DOPA (given jointly with benserazide) was not changed by SL 82.0715. SL 82.0715 had no effect on fluphenazine- and haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mice. CGP 37849 attenuated catalepsy induced by haloperidol; that effect was not changed by SL 82.075. The studied compound did not affect the immobility time and had no effect on the action of MK-801 or CGP 37849 in the forced swimming test. The obtained results indicate that SL 82.0715 has a different pharmacological profile than other NMDA antagonists (at least MK-801 and CGP 37849). SL 82.0715 does not increase behavioral actions of MK-801 and CGP 37849, potentiating anticonvulsant effect of CGP 37849 only.
Oxidative damage to placental DNA can result in negative pregnancy outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight (LBW).
We investigated associations between the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2´-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a marker of oxidative DNA damage, in placental DNA, exposure to air pollutants during pregnancy, genetic polymorphisms in 94 selected genes, and pregnancy outcomes.
We studied 891 newborns who were IUGR- or LBW-affected or normal weight and were born between 1994 and 1999 in the Czech Republic in two districts with different levels of air pollution.
We found nonsignificantly elevated 8-oxodG levels in the IUGR-affected group compared with the non-IUGR group (p = 0.055). Similarly, slightly elevated 8-oxodG levels were found in the LBW-affected group compared with the non-LBW group (p < 0.050). In univariate analyses, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with 8-oxodG levels, IUGR, and LBW. Exposure to particulate matter < 2.5 µm was associated with increased 8-oxodG levels in placental DNA and LBW. However, multivariate-adjusted logistic regression revealed that above-median 8-oxodG levels were the only factor significantly associated with IUGR [OR = 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-2.37; p = 0.022]. Above-median levels of 8-oxodG were associated with LBW (OR = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.15-3.06; p = 0.011). Other variables associated with LBW included sex and gestational age of the newborn, maternal smoking, and haplotypes in the promoter region of the gene encoding mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2). The role of air pollutants in the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes seemed to be less important.
Levels of 8-oxodG in placental DNA were associated with the risk of IUGR as well as LBW. Newborn's sex, gestational age, maternal smoking, and genetic polymorphisms in the promoter region of the MBL2 gene were associated with LBW incidence.
Previous studies have reported positive associations between maternal exposure to air pollutants and several adverse birth outcomes. However, there have been no studies assessing the association between environmental levels of hazardous air pollutants, such as benzene, and neural tube defects (NTDs), a common and serious group of congenital malformations.
Our goal was to conduct a case-control study assessing the association between ambient air levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) and the prevalence of NTDs among offspring.
The Texas Birth Defects Registry provided data on NTD cases (spina bifida and anencephaly) delivered between 1999 and 2004. The control group was a random sample of unaffected live births, frequency matched to cases on year of birth. Census tract-level estimates of annual BTEX levels were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1999 Assessment System for Population Exposure Nationwide. Restricted cubic splines were used in mixed-effects logistic regression models to determine associations between each pollutant and NTD phenotype.
Mothers living in census tracts with the highest benzene levels were more likely to have offspring with spina bifida than were women living in census tracts with the lowest levels (odds ratio = 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-4.33). No significant associations were observed between anencephaly and benzene or between any of the NTD phenotypes and toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylene.
In the first study to assess the relationship between environmental levels of BTEX and NTDs, we found an association between benzene and spina bifida. Our results contribute to the growing body of evidence regarding air pollutant exposure and adverse birth outcomes.
Twenty-one patients with advanced malignant melanoma were treated with dacarbazine at a dose of 800 mg/m2 as a single infusion and dactinomycin at a dose of 1.2 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Hematologic toxicity was mild and gastrointestinal toxicity was tolerable. The response rate for evaluable patients was 22%, which included both men and women with visceral disease. Three of the four responses were complete. Durations of response were 4, 6, 9, and 48+ months. We conclude that dacarbazine can be safely and effectively given as a single dose along with dactinomycin. The possibility that this combination may be more effective than single agents in obtaining complete responses in patients with visceral disease must be explored further.
Both the density and level of mRNA encoding insulin receptors in the kidney are inversely related to the dietary sodium content, suggesting a feedback mechanism that limits the insulin-induced sodium retention when extracellular fluid volume is expanded. Because angiotensin II affects tissue sensitivity to insulin in humans, we investigated whether angiotensin II affects insulin receptor binding and mRNA levels in the kidney, liver, and renal arteries of normal rats and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus. Non-diabetic and diabetic rats were infused for 7 days with either vehicle or angiotensin II at a rate of 200 ng. kg-1. min-1. In a separate experiment, normal rats were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 100 mg/dl in the drinking water) or vehicle for 7 days. Regional analysis of insulin receptor binding in the kidney and renal arteries was performed by an in situ technique using computerized microdensitometry and emulsion autoradiography. Insulin receptor mRNA levels were determined in renal and hepatic tissue by Northern blot hybridization and normalized with 28S rRNA. No differences in blood pressure were observed among diabetic and non-diabetic rats infused with either vehicle or angiotensin II, whereas captopril-treated rats had significantly lower blood pressure levels than their respective controls. Angiotensin II significantly decreased plasma renin concentration in both non-diabetic and diabetic rats. Insulin receptor number was significantly greater in the renal cortex of diabetic rats than in non-diabetics, whereas no significant differences were found in the outer medulla, inner medulla, or renal arteries. Angiotensin II infusion did not affect either the number or affinity of insulin receptors in any of the renal regions studied. Insulin receptor mRNA levels were significantly greater in the kidney and liver of diabetic rats than in non-diabetics and were not affected by angiotensin II infusion. Similar to angiotensin II infusion, captopril treatment did not affect either renal insulin receptor binding or mRNA levels. Thus, diabetic rats have increased insulin receptor binding and mRNA levels in comparison to non-diabetic rats. Angiotensin II infusion and captopril treatment do not affect insulin receptor binding and mRNA levels in the kidney, arguing against a role for this peptide in the modulation of renal sensitivity to insulin.
We report the case of a young man who developed acute renal failure after ingestion of cocaine wrapped in foil. We did not find either clinical or clear biochemical signs of rhabdomyolysis. The possible role of high blood cocaine level in the development of acute renal failure has been speculated and a direct vasoconstrictive effect on renal vessels followed by acute tubular necrosis has been hypothesized.
Although it has been hypothesized that fetal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may increase obesity risk, empirical data are limited, and it is uncertain how early in life any effects may begin.
We explored whether prenatal exposure to several organochlorine compounds (OCs) is associated with rapid growth in the first 6 months of life and body mass index (BMI) later in infancy.
Data come from the INMA (Infancia y Medio-Ambiente) Child and Environment birth cohort in Spain, which recruited 657 women in early pregnancy. Rapid growth during the first 6 months was defined as a change in weight-for-age z-scores > 0.67, and elevated BMI at 14 months, as a z-score ≥ the 85th percentile. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the risk of rapid growth or elevated BMI associated with 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene, β-hexachlorohexane, and polychlorinated biphenyls in first-trimester maternal serum.
After multivariable adjustment including other OCs, DDE exposure above the first quartile was associated with doubling of the risk of rapid growth among children of normal-weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2), but not overweight, mothers. DDE was also associated with elevated BMI at 14 months (relative risk per unit increase in log DDE = 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.03). Other OCs were not associated with rapid growth or elevated BMI after adjustment.
In this study we found prenatal DDE exposure to be associated with rapid weight gain in the first 6 months and elevated BMI later in infancy, among infants of normal-weight mothers. More research exploring the potential role of chemical exposures in early-onset obesity is needed.
Only about 30% of cases of breast cancer can be explained by accepted risk factors. Occupational studies have shown associations between the incidence of breast cancer and exposure to contaminants that are found in ambient air.
We sought to determine whether the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer is associated with exposure to urban air pollution.
We used data from a case-control study conducted in Montreal, Quebec, in 1996-1997. Cases were 383 women with incident invasive breast cancer, and controls were 416 women with other incident, malignant cancers, excluding those potentially associated with selected occupational exposures. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured across Montreal in 2005-2006. We developed a land-use regression model to predict concentrations of NO2 across Montreal for 2006, and developed two methods to extrapolate the estimates to 1985 and 1996. We linked these estimates to addresses of residences of subjects at time of interview. We used unconditional logistic regression to adjust for accepted and suspected risk factors and occupational exposures.
For each increase of 5 ppb NO2 estimated in 1996, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.71). Although the size of effect varied somewhat across periods, we found an increased risk of approximately 25% for every increase of 5 ppb in exposure.
We found evidence of an association between the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer and exposure to ambient concentrations of NO2. Further studies are needed to confirm whether NO2 or other components of traffic-related pollution are indeed associated with increased risks.
Aberrant DNA methylation patterns play an important role in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. The DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine and decitabine have shown significant clinical benefits in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but their precise mode of action remains to be established. Both drugs have been shown the ability to deplete DNA methyltransferase enzymes and to induce DNA demethylation and epigenetic reprogramming in vitro. However, drug-induced methylation changes have remained poorly characterized in patients and therapy-related models. We have now analyzed azacytidine-induced demethylation responses in myeloid leukemia cell lines. These cells showed remarkable differences in the drug-induced depletion of DNA methyltransferases that coincided with their demethylation responses. In agreement with these data, DNA methylation analysis of blood and bone marrow samples from MDS patients undergoing azacytidine therapy also revealed substantial differences in the epigenetic responses of individual patients. Significant, transient demethylation could be observed in 3 of 6 patients and affected many hypermethylated loci in a complex pattern. Our results provide important proof-of-mechanism data for the demethylating activity of azacytidine in MDS patients and provide detailed insight into drug-induced demethylation responses.
