De novo formation of laminin-positive basement membranes was found to be a distinct morphologic feature of diethylnitrosamine/phenobarbital-induced hepatocellular carcinomas of the rat. The first appearance of extracellularly located laminin occurred in the preneoplastic liver lesions (corresponding to neoplastic nodules), and this feature became successively more prominent during the course of hepatocellular carcinoma development. Most groups of tumor cells were surrounded by laminin-positive basement membrane material. The laminin-positive material was also deposited along the sinusoids, a location where no laminin was seen in normal rat liver. The amount of extractable laminin from hepatocellular carcinomas was significantly higher (approximately 100 ng per mg tissue) than that of normal liver tissue (less than 20 ng per mg). In vitro experiments demonstrated that normal and preneoplastic rat hepatocytes had the capacity to lay down basement membrane-like material. This occurred, however, only when the hepatocytes were cocultured with certain feeder cells or when grown in the presence of their conditioned media. These results indicate that during experimental hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat some as yet undefined humoral factor(s) might influence the hepatocytes to turn on genes encoding the basement membrane components and further stimulate the assembly and deposition of basement membranes.
Erythrosine was given in the diet to provide levels of 0 (control), 0.005, 0.015 and 0.045% from 5 weeks of age of the F(0) generation to 9 weeks of age of the F(1) generation in mice, and selected reproductive and neurobehavioural parameters were measured. There were no adverse effects of erythrosine on either litter size, litter weight or sex ratio at birth. The average body weight of the offspring was significantly increased in the middle-dose group in both sexes during the lactation period. In behavioural developmental parameters, any variables showed no significant adverse effects in either sex in the lactation period. In movement activity of exploratory behaviour, several parameters were significantly changed in the high-dose group, and those effects were dose related in adult females in the F(0) and F(1) generations and in male offspring in the F(1) generation. The dose level of erythrosine in the present study produced few adverse effects in reproductive and neurobehavioural parameters in mice.
We examined the hypothesis that excess accumulation of major quinidine metabolites or the commercial impurity dihydroquinidine contributes to the development of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes, [TdP]) in patients taking quinidine. Total and free plasma concentrations of these compounds were measured by reverse-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection and equilibrium dialysis in 19 patients with TdP and 38 control patients tolerating quinidine therapy without toxicity. No significant differences were found between the two groups of patients. Ratios of metabolite or dihydroquinidine to quinidine varied up to tenfold among patients but were similarly distributed in the TdP and control groups. Only the metabolite 3-hydroxyquinidine was present at free plasma concentrations that exceeded free concentrations of quinidine. We conclude that although quinidine metabolism is highly variable, there does not appear to be any correlation between the plasma concentrations of quinidine, its metabolites or dihydroquinidine, and the subsequent development of TdP.
Several studies have shown antitumor activities of the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7 (mda-7) and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac when used as a monotherapies against a wide variety of human cancers. However, the combined effects of mda-7 and sulindac have not previously been tested. Therefore, we tested the antitumor activity of an adenoviral vector expressing mda-7 (Ad-mda7) in combination with sulindac against non-small cell lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. When treated with Ad-mda7 in combination with sulindac, human lung cancer cells (A549 and H1299) underwent growth suppression resulting in apoptosis. The growth inhibition induced by Ad-mda7 in combination with sulindac was significantly greater than that observed with Ad-mda7 or sulindac alone. Furthermore, the degree of growth inhibition induced using this combination was dose-dependent for sulindac. Treatment with Ad-mda7 in combination with sulindac had no growth inhibitory effects on human normal lung (CCD-16) fibroblasts. We then investigated the mechanism by which sulindac enhances Ad-mda7-mediated apoptosis. Sulindac increased expression of ectopic MDA-7 protein in tumor cells, thereby increasing the expression of downstream effectors RNA-dependent protein kinase, p38MAPK, caspase-9, and caspase-3 and enhancing apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the increased expression of MDA-7 protein in sulindac-treated cells was due to increased half-life of the MDA-7 protein. Finally, treatment of human lung tumor xenografts in nude mice with Ad-mda7 plus sulindac significantly suppressed growth (P = 0.001) compared with Ad-mda7 or sulindac alone. Our results show for the first time that combined treatment with Ad-mda7 plus sulindac enhances growth inhibition and apoptosis of human lung cancer cells. The increased antitumor activity observed with the combination treatment is a result of increased half-life of MDA-7 protein. Regulation of protein turnover is a heretofore-unrecognized mechanism of this nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
Only one crystal structure is currently available for tumor marker AKR1B10, complexed with NADP(+) and tolrestat, which is an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) of the carboxylic acid type. Here, the X-ray structure of the complex of the V301L substituted AKR1B10 holoenzyme with fidarestat, an ARI of the cyclic imide type, was obtained at 1.60Ã… resolution by replacement soaking of crystals containing tolrestat. Previously, fidarestat was found to be safe in phase III trials for diabetic neuropathy and, consistent with its low in vivo side effects, was highly selective for aldose reductase (AR or AKR1B1) versus aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). Now, inhibition studies showed that fidarestat was indeed 1300-fold more selective for AR as compared to AKR1B10, while the change of Val to Leu (found in AR) caused a 20-fold decrease in the IC50 value with fidarestat. Structural analysis of the V301L AKR1B10-fidarestat complex displayed enzyme-inhibitor interactions similar to those of the AR-fidarestat complex. However, a close inspection of both the new crystal structure and a computer model of the wild-type AKR1B10 complex with fidarestat revealed subtle changes that could affect fidarestat binding. In the crystal structure, a significant motion of loop A was observed between AR and V301L AKR1B10, linked to a Phe-122/Phe-123 side chain displacement. This was due to the presence of the more voluminous Gln-303 side chain (Ser-302 in AR) and of a water molecule buried in a subpocket located at the base of flexible loop A. In the wild-type AKR1B10 model, a short contact was predicted between the Val-301 side chain and fidarestat, but would not be present in AR or in V301L AKR1B10. Overall, these changes could contribute to the difference in inhibitory potency of fidarestat between AR and AKR1B10.
A 72-year old man developed jaundice while on fusidic acid therapy for suspected osteomyelitis. Hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly of the conjugated variety and elevation in liver enzymes was mild and transient. Although serum bilirubin fell rapidly after fusidic acid was stopped, complete resolution of the hyperbilirubinemia took nearly a month. Other possible causes of jaundice were excluded. Light microscopy of a needle liver biopsy showed focal hepatocyte feathery degeneration, intracellular bile retention, and canalicular bile plugging, most prominent in perivenous regions. Electron microscopy revealed varying degrees of canalicular dilatation, loss of microvilli, and disruption of the canalicular membrane with vesicular bleb formation as well as canalicular bile plugs. Widening of the pericanalicular ectoplasmic zone with accumulation of cytoskeletal filaments was also noted. These findings are similar to those reported in experimental cholestasis induced by bile acids. Possible mechanisms of jaundice caused by fusidic acid are discussed.
Chronic neuroleptic treatment in rats induces vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) that mimic tardive dyskinesia. Such treatment decreases overall striatal synaptic density, but rats with VCMs also have decreased density of symmetric synapses, indicating less inhibitory synaptic transmission. This study examined the striatum to determine if enkephalinergic terminals, which form symmetric synapses, are affected. All synapses combined, asymmetric and symmetric axospinous, and enkephalinergic synapses were significantly reduced in density in the haloperidol treated group as compared to controls. A loss of asymmetric axodendritic synapses, typical of excitatory thalamic inputs, was observed preferentially in the low VCM group. A loss of symmetric axodendritic synapses was observed preferentially in the high VCM group. This study indicates that a population of synapses, other than enkephalinergic ones, is preferentially lost in the high VCM group. Moreover, lack of VCMs may be due to changes in synaptic organization that are protective as well as the absence of pathologic connections.
The antihypertensive and hemodynamic effects of lisinopril and atenolol were evaluated in 21 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic performances were assessed prior to and following treatment by first-pass radionuclide cineangiography at rest and during peak upright bicycle exercise. Both lisinopril and atenolol treatment significantly reduced the blood pressure. Lisinopril therapy was associated with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes but no change in stroke volume, cardiac output, peak ejection rate, peak filling rate, time to peak ejection rate, or time to peak filling rate. In contrast, atenolol therapy was associated with an increase in end-diastolic volume and stroke volume but no change in cardiac output; the left ventricular peak ejection and peak filling rates were decreased by atenolol treatment. Although both lisinopril and atenolol each significantly reduced the blood pressure, lisinopril had no effect on left ventricular systolic or diastolic performance; in contrast, atenolol decreased both systolic and diastolic parameters of ventricular performance. Left ventricular function may be affected in significantly different ways despite apparent similarities in blood pressure control in patients who respond to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Differences in hemodynamic response to an antihypertensive agent may be important in the selection of a drug for the treatment of subsets of patients with cardiac function abnormalities.
Prenatal exposure to ethanol leads to a myriad of developmental disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, often characterized by growth and mental retardation, central nervous system damage, and specific craniofacial dysmorphic features. The mechanisms of ethanol toxicity are not fully understood, but exposure during development affects the expression of several genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in some of these processes, however, it is not yet clear if they are involved in ethanol-induced toxicity. In order to clarify this question, we have exposed zebrafish embryos to ethanol and evaluated whether a miRNA deregulation signature could be obtained. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 1 and 1.5% of ethanol from 4 h postfertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf. The miRNA expression profiles obtained reveal significant miRNA deregulation and show that both ethanol concentrations upregulate miR-153a, miR-725, miR-30d, let-7k, miR-100, miR-738, and miR-732. Putative gene targets of deregulated miRNAs are involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and transcription, which are the main processes affected by ethanol toxicity. The conservation of affected mechanisms among vertebrates leads us to postulate that similar miRNA deregulation occurs in humans, highlighting a relevant role of miRNAs in ethanol toxicology.
We report two cases of severe, acute myopathy with selective degeneration of myosin filaments in asthmatics who developed respiratory failure with hypercapnia and acidosis requiring endotracheal intubation, administration of vecuronium and prolonged ventilatory support. Hypoxia was documented in one case and probably present in the other. Both patients received prolonged treatment with high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone. Flaccid quadriparesis was noted after discontinuation of vecuronium. Muscle biopsy showed nonspecific myopathic changes on light microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed selective loss of myosin filaments in many fibers. Recovery occurred within 2 months with supportive treatment. This entity is probably related to a combination of high doses of corticosteroids, vecuronium administration and metabolic abnormalities associated with respiratory failure.
To estimate the prevalence of past year laxative use or vomiting weight control behaviors among adolescent females in the general population and to examine the relationship between these behaviors and substance use among adolescent females, with a specific focus on past year 3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) ("Ecstasy") use.
Secondary analyses were conducted using a nationally representative sample of females aged 12 to 17 years (n = 4292) from the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA). Logistic regression was used to examine bivariate relationships between past year laxative use or vomiting weight control behaviors and substance use and the multivariate relationship between unhealthy weight control behaviors and Ecstasy use.
Approximately 10% of adolescent females had used laxatives or vomited to lose weight in the past year. Adolescent females who had used laxatives or vomited to lose weight in the past year were more likely than those who had not to have used substances during the past year, including Ecstasy, inhalants, nonmedical psychotherapeutics, marijuana, cigarettes, and alcohol. After controlling for demographics and other substance use, past year laxative use or vomiting weight control behaviors were positively associated with past year Ecstasy use (OR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.05, 3.14; p = 0.04).
Laxative use or vomiting weight control behaviors are a significant problem among the general population of adolescent females and are related to an increased risk of Ecstasy use.
During the past six years an increasing number of liver-cell adenomas in women were diagnosed, and we undertook a study of possible etiologic factors, including use of oral contraceptives, in 42 women. There was a significant difference between cases and matched controls in mean months of oral-contraceptive use: 73.4 as compared to 36.2 (P less than 0.001). The women with adenomas took mestranol-containing pills much more commonly than the controls (P less than 0.0001). Hemorrhage into the tumor was often associated with the onset of menstruation in women taking oral contraceptives. Long-term use of oral contraceptives, especially those containing a high total dose of steroids or mestranol as the synthetic estrogen, should be balanced against risks of side effects of the drugs.
We report the simultaneous development of fulminant hepatic failure and necrotizing pancreatitis in a patient treated with sulfasalazine. The patient had recent onset of ulcerative colitis. A diffuse skin rash and fulminant hepatic failure developed 2-3 wk after initiation of sulfasalazine therapy. An exploratory laparotomy revealed severe necrotizing pancreatitis with phlegmon, in addition to confluent hepatic necrosis. Electron microscopy of the liver was consistent with drug injury. The patient died after 2 months of hospitalization. This is the first reported case of the concurrent development of these complications associated with sulfasalazine hypersensitivity. These potential adverse effects of sulfasalazine should be considered when using this agent.
This study was undertaken to identify the ototoxic potential of two jet fuels presented alone and in combination with noise. Rats were exposed via a subacute inhalation paradigm to JP-8 jet fuel, a kerosene-based fuel refined from petroleum, and a synthetic fuel produced by the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. Although JP-8 contains small ( approximately 5%) concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons some of which known to be ototoxic, the synthetic fuel does not. The objectives of this study were to identify a lowest observed adverse effect level and a no observed adverse effect level for each jet fuel and to provide some preliminary, but admittedly, indirect evidence concerning the possible role of the aromatic hydrocarbon component of petroleum-based jet fuel on hearing. Rats (n = 5-19) received inhalation exposure to JP-8 or to FT fuel for 4 h/day on five consecutive days at doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/m(3). Additional groups were exposed to various fuel concentrations followed by 1 h of an octave band of noise, noise alone, or no exposure to fuel or noise. Significant dose-related impairment in the distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) was seen in subjects exposed to combined JP-8 plus noise exposure when JP-8 levels of at least 1000 mg/m(3) were presented. No noticeable impairment was observed at JP-8 levels of 500 mg/m(3) + noise. In contrast to the effects of JP-8 on noise-induced hearing loss, FT exposure had no effect by itself or in combination with noise exposure even at the highest exposure level tested. Despite an observed loss in DPOAE amplitude seen only when JP-8 and noise were combined, there was no loss in auditory threshold or increase in hair cell loss in any exposure group.
Male Wistar rats were subjected to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and allowed to recover. After reaching the chronic state with spontaneous seizures they were tested in an 8-arm radial maze. During learning trials, epileptic rats made significantly more errors than controls. Even in the last trials epileptic rats did not improve their performance, indicating severe learning disability. These results suggest that spontaneous seizures after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus are a useful model for studying the learning and memory impairment detected in some cases of symptomatic epilepsy.
A proteomic analysis of proteins bound to the osteocalcin OSE2 sequence of the mouse osteocalcin promoter identified TRPS1 as a regulator of osteocalcin transcription. Mutations in the TRPS1 gene are responsible for human tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome, which is characterized by skeletal and craniofacial abnormalities. TRPS1 has been shown to bind regulatory promoter sequences containing GATA consensus binding sites and to repress transcription of genes involved in chondrocyte differentiation. Here we show that TRPS1 can directly bind the osteocalcin promoter in the presence or absence of Runx2. TRPS1 binds through a GATA binding sequence in the proximal promoter of the osteocalcin gene. The GATA binding site is conserved in mice, humans, and rats, although its location and orientation are not. Mutation of the mouse or human GATA binding sequence abrogates binding of TRPS1 to the osteocalcin promoter. We show that TRPS1 is expressed in osteosarcoma cells and upon induction of osteoblast differentiation in primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells and that TRPS1 regulates the expression of osteocalcin in both cell types. The expression of TRPS1 modulates mineralized bone matrix formation in differentiating osteoblast cells. These data suggest a role for TRPS1 in osteoblast differentiation, in addition to its previously described role in chondrogenesis.
Demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin are the main active ingredients isolated from Curcumae Longae Radix. Recent studies demonstrated that both compounds exhibit antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects as well as effects on cancer cell lines. In this study, we compared the activities of demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, and both compounds were evaluated on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity in a RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. The evaluation:results suggested that the anti-inflammatory properties of demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin were attributed to the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression, as initiated by the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. Additionally, both of them significantly inhibited carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice. Taken together, all of the results showed that the suppressive effect of demethoxycurcumin was stronger than that of bisdemethoxycurcumin, indicating that the methoxy group had enhanced demethoxycurcumin's anti-inflammation effects.
Flutamide is an antiandrogen and frequently used for the treatment of prostatic cancer. Severe hepatotoxicity occurs in few patients but may be fatal. We report on two patients with prostatic cancer who received a therapy with flutamide. They showed different degrees of liver damage. One patient recovered completely after withdrawal of Flutamide under medication with steroids. Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings returned to normal within four weeks. Despite immediate withdrawal of Flutamide, the other patient showed a severe course with progressive liver dysfunction and hepatorenal syndrome. He finally died under the clinical picture of fulminant hepatic coma. This case represents the first death associated with flutamide in Germany. The literature concerning the metabolism of flutamide and the published cases of hepatotoxicity of this drug are reviewed.
We and others have shown that the copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B play a role in cellular resistance to cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP). In this study, we found that ATP7A transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) and fibroblasts isolated from Menkes disease patients enhanced resistance not only to CDDP but also to various anticancer drugs, such as vincristine, paclitaxel, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38), etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantron, and 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11). ATP7A preferentially localized doxorubicin fluorescence to the Golgi apparatus in contrast to the more intense nuclear staining of doxorubicin in the parental cells. Brefeldin A partially and monensin completely altered the distribution of doxorubicin to the nuclei in the ATP7A-expressing cells. ATP7A expression also enhanced the efflux rates of doxorubicin and SN-38 from cells and increased the uptake of SN-38 in membrane vesicles. These findings strongly suggested that ATP7A confers multidrug resistance to the cells by compartmentalizing drugs in the Golgi apparatus and by enhancing efflux of these drugs, and the trans-Golgi network has an important role of ATP7A-related drug resistance. ATP7A was expressed in 8 of 34 (23.5%) clinical colon cancer specimens but not in the adjacent normal epithelium. Using the histoculture drug response assay that is useful for the prediction of drug sensitivity of clinical cancers, ATP7A-expressing colon cancer cells were significantly more resistant to SN-38 than ATP7A-negative cells. Thus, ATP7A confers resistance to various anticancer agents on cancer cells and might be a good index of drug resistance in clinical colon cancers.
4-Aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-transaminase, GABA-T, EC 2.6.1.19) deficiency (McKusick 137150), an inborn error of GABA degradation, has until now been documented in only a single Flemish child. Compared to the other defects of GABA degradation, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH, EC 1.2.1.24) deficiency with > 150 patients (McKusick 271980) and pyridoxine-dependent seizures with > 100 patients ('putative' glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, EC 4.1.1.15) deficiency; McKusick 266100), GABA-T deficiency is very rare. We present a summary of the clinical, biochemical, enzymatic and molecular findings on the index proband, and a recently identified second patient, with GABA-T deficiency. The phenotype in both included psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, lethargy, refractory seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities. In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis of GABA-T deficiency, we isolated and characterized a 1.5 kb cDNA encoding human GABA-T, in addition to a 41 kb genomic clone which encompassed the GABA-T coding region. Standard methods of cloning and sequencing revealed an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 754 of the coding region in lymphoblast cDNAs derived from the index proband. This mutation resulted in substitution of an invariant arginine at amino acid 220 by lysine. Expression of the mutant in E. coli, followed by isolation and enzymatic characterization of the recombinant protein, revealed an enzyme whose Vmax was reduced to 25% of wild-type activity. The patient and father were heterozygous for this allele; the second allele in the patient remains unidentified. Genomic Southern analysis revealed that the second proband most likely harbours a deletion in the 3' region of the GABA-T gene.
An 11-year-old girl with a recurrent fixed drug eruption to tartrazine on the dorsum of the left hand is presented. Oral provocation tests to both the suspected food, an artificially coloured cheese crisp, and to tartrazine were positive. This case highlights fire need to consider artificial flavours, colours and preservatives as potential culprits in classic drug eruptions.
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia and the antiphospholipid syndrome-disorders known to contribute to both arterial and venous thrombosis. In both of these conditions and RVO, platelet activation occurs. Aspirin, not warfarin, is the most effective antithrombotic agent in RVO and, taken together, these observations suggest an important role for platelets in this common ocular thrombotic condition. Platelet glycoprotein Ia/IIa (GpIa/IIa) is an adhesion molecule mediating platelet-collagen interactions and is key to the initiation of thrombosis. Recently, the cellular density of this molecule was shown to be determined by two silent, linked polymorphisms (C807T/G873A) within the GpIa/IIa gene. There is evidence that some of the resulting genotypes are associated with thrombo-embolic disease. This study therefore aimed to establish the prevalence of the GpIa/IIa polymorphisms and the three commonest hereditary thrombophilic disorders (prothrombin gene G20210A (PT) mutation, Factor V Leiden (FVL), and the thermolabile methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T (MTHFR) mutation) in patients with RVO and normal controls. The GpIa/IIa polymorphisms and thrombophilic abnormalities were all identified using the polymerase chain reaction.Our results show that the frequency of the GpIa/IIa polymorphisms was similar in our normal control population to previously published series. Patients with RVO, however, had only a 10% (4/40) frequency of the lowest risk subtype (CC/GG) compared to 37.5% (15/40) in the control group-P 0.0039. The incidence of the PT, FVL, and MTHFR thrombophilic mutations was not different between the two groups, but interestingly none of the 7/40 RVO cases with a PT, FVL, or MTHFR mutation had the low-risk GpIa/IIa genotype while all but one of the controls did-P<0.05. Thus, 17.5% of RVO patients harboured more than one prothrombotic abnormality. The principal difference between the RVO and control group was the very high incidence of the intermediate-risk GpIa/IIa subtype (CT/GA)-82.5 vs 50%, P&<0.05. These results suggest a major role for GpIa/IIa polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of RVO.
Many adverse reactions to quinine have been reported. A 65 year old woman taking quinine sulphate for nocturnal leg cramps presented for investigation of episodes of malaise, fever, nausea, vomiting, and polyarthralgia. Granulomatous hepatitis was diagnosed, for which no common cause was found. She was challenged with quinine sulphate; within hours her temperature had risen and her symptoms returned; transaminase activities rose within 48 hours, as did erythrocyte sedimentation rate. After withdrawal of the drug symptoms abated and transaminase activities returned to normal. The biochemical response to challenge with quinine implicates the drug as the cause of the liver disturbances. Quinine should be added to the list of drugs known to cause granulomatous hepatitis and should be considered in cases where symptoms are episodic or where no other cause is apparent.
Cocaine use has been associated with a significant risk of myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction (MI). The previous approach to the treatment of cocaine-induced MI focused on medical treatment with verapamil, nitroglycerine and thrombolytics. Percutaneous revascularization for the cocaine-associated MI has been reported and is the preferred treatment modality. Identification of culprit vessel in the patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction associated with cocaine use is problematic owing to the frequent presence of baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. Chronic cocaine use predisposes to diffuse coronary vasculopathy and may cause systemic alteration of coagulation parameters. Multivessel coronary thrombosis presenting as myocardial infarction associated with cocaine use has not been previously reported. This study describes a case of multivessel coronary thrombosis caused by cocaine ingestion successfully treated with multivessel primary angioplasty.
