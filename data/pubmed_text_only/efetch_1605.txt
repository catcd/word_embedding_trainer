Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease, but is controversial in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Using a prospective cohort of HIV-hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfected patients transplanted between 2001-2007; outcomes including survival and HBV clinical recurrence were determined. Twenty-two coinfected patients underwent LT; 45% had detectable HBV DNA pre-LT and 72% were receiving anti-HBV drugs with efficacy against lamivudine-resistant HBV. Post-LT, all patients received hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) plus nucleos(t)ide analogues and remained HBsAg negative without clinical evidence of HBV recurrence, with a median follow-up 3.5 years. Low-level HBV viremia (median 108 IU/mL, range 9-789) was intermittently detected in 7/13 but not associated with HBsAg detection or ALT elevation. Compared with 20 HBV monoinfected patients on similar HBV prophylaxis and median follow-up of 4.0 years, patient and graft survival were similar: 100% versus 85% in HBV mono- versus coinfected patients (p = 0.08, log rank test). LT is effective for HIV-HBV coinfected patients with complications of cirrhosis, including those who are HBV DNA positive at the time of LT. Combination HBIG and antivirals is effective as prophylaxis with no clinical evidence of HBV recurrence but low-level HBV DNA is detectable in approximately 50% of recipients.
Adult patients with long-standing hypertension have been reported to experience an impairment in renal function when treatment with potent vasodilating agents is initiated. To document that this sequence may occur in children as well, we report the case of a 4-year-old boy with renal disease in whom reduction of blood pressure to normal levels was accompanied on three occasions by oliguric renal failure. During each episode, the correlation between reduction in blood pressure and increase in serum creatinine level was significant (P less than .05); furthermore, the slope of the relationship was similar with each episode. This phenomenon suggests an impairment of renal autoregulation in this patient. Maintenance of normal blood pressure for several months was accompanied by a gradual return of renal function to pretreatment levels. This case suggests that particular attention should be paid to renal function during the initiation of antihypertensive therapy, particularly in patients with renal vascular damage. Present evidence does not appear to warrant modification of the current therapeutic philosophy of aggressive management in patients with severe hypertension.
Six patients with recurrent cystine stones and cystinuria were treated with MPG. Three patients were treated for 3 years and 3 patients for 6 months. A relatively high dosage resulted in a reduction of the cytinuria. Since MPG has almost no side effects it represents a valuable aid in the treatment of cystine stones.
Increased apoptosis has been reported in acute puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN). The aim of this study was to investigate if increased apoptosis is related to increased expression of apoptosis-associated proteins (AAP) in this model of nephrosis. Sprague-Dawley rats were made nephrotic by intraperitoneal injection of one dose of puromycin aminonucleoside. Renal tissues were obtained at 1, 2 and 7 weeks after injection and apoptosis was investigated by TUNEL and by electron microscopy. Fas, Fas ligand, p53, Bax and Bcl-2 expressions were analyzed by the respective monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, using indirect immunofluorescence. In the glomerulus of nephrotic animals, increased apoptosis was accompanied with increased expression of p53, Fas and Bax. In the interstitium, high expression of apoptosis, Fas, Fas-L and Bax were observed and in tubules increased apoptosis was accompanied with increased expression of p53, Fas and Fas-L. Bcl-2 was increased in interstitium and tubules during PAN. The incidence of apoptosis during PAN was correlated with the expression of AAP in glomerulus (p53), interstitium (Fas, Fas-L and Bax) and tubules (Fas, Fas-L, p53 and Bcl-2). There was correlation between Fas and Fas-L expression in interstitium and tubules. About 4% of glomerular and 25% of tubular p53 positive cells were apoptotic cells. The data suggest that increased local expression of AAP could contribute to renal apoptosis in the glomerular, interstitial and tubular compartments during this experimental model of nephrosis.
During the treatment of 53 young heroin addicts with intramuscular sulpiride for the prevention of withdrawal symptoms, the emergence of extrapyramidal manifestations involving the head, neck and upper trunk in about 40 percent of the patients has been observed. These symptoms occurred with sulpiride dosages in the 'antineurotic' range (not more than 400 mg daily), which practically never produce such symptoms in patients receiving the drug for other clinical indications. The symptoms appeared soon after the first few injections of sulpiride, and yielded readily to a single or repeated intravenous diazepam administration (10 mg). The possible mechanism involved in the production of extrapyramidal manifestations from sulpiride, and a tentative explanation of why such symptoms are produced by doses of this drug lower than those needed to produce the same effects in nonaddicts, are discussed.
Birds differ in sensitivity to the embryotoxic effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which complicates environmental risk assessments for these chemicals. Recent research has shown that the identities of amino acid residues 324 and 380 in the avian aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 (AHR1) ligand binding domain (LBD) are primarily responsible for differences in avian species sensitivity to selected dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans. A luciferase reporter gene (LRG) assay was developed in our laboratory to measure AHR1-mediated induction of a cytochrome P450 1A5 reporter gene in COS-7 cells transfected with different avian AHR1 constructs. In the present study, the LRG assay was used to measure the concentration-dependent effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and PCBs 126, 77, 105 and 118 on luciferase activity in COS-7 cells transfected with AHR1 constructs representative of 86 avian species in order to predict their sensitivity to PCB-induced embryolethality and the relative potency of PCBs in these species. The results of the LRG assay indicate that the identity of amino acid residues 324 and 380 in the AHR1 LBD are the major determinants of avian species sensitivity to PCBs. The relative potency of PCBs did not differ greatly among AHR1 constructs. Luciferase activity was significantly correlated with embryolethality data obtained from the literature (R(2)≥0.87, p<0.0001). Thus, the LRG assay in combination with the knowledge of a species' AHR1 LBD sequence can be used to predict PCB-induced embryolethality in potentially any avian species of interest without the use of lethal methods on a large number of individuals.
Identification of mechanisms underlying endometriosis pathogenesis will facilitate understanding and treatment of infertility and pain associated with this disorder. Herein, we investigated the expression of steroidogenic pathway enzymes and key decidualization biomarkers in endometrial tissue and in eutopic endometrial stromal fibroblasts (hESFs) from women with vs. those without endometriosis, and subsequently treated in vitro with 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) or progesterone (P4). Real-time quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and radiometric aromatase activity assay were used. The results demonstrate significantly increased (14.5-fold; P=0.037) expression of aromatase in eutopic endometrium of women with disease. In 8-Br-cAMP-treated hESF from eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis, the balance in estradiol (E2) and P4 biosynthetic and metabolizing enzymes is disturbed (decreased HSD3B1 and HSD17B2, and increased HSD17B1 and aromatase), with the equilibrium being shifted towards an E2-enriched milieu. However, hESF from the same group of women treated with P4 did not demonstrate such responsiveness. Lower expression of IGFBP1 and prolactin mRNA and protein was observed in hESF from women with vs. those without endometriosis in response to 8-Br-cAMP, but not P4, suggesting a blunted response of these decidual biomarkers to activation of the PKA pathway in eutopic endometrium in women with disease. The dichotomy of 8-Br-cAMP regulation of select steroidogenic enzymes leading to an enriched E2 milieu within the endometrium and a blunted response of decidual biomarkers to this decidualizing agent of hESF from women with endometriosis suggests resistance to full decidualization of the stromal fibroblasts and mechanisms underlying implantation failure and the pathophysiology of this disorder.
ACE polymorphism, especially genotype DD or D allele, may be involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. It may also have different effects on the reduction of proteinuria by ACE inhibitors in patients with proteinuria. We investigated the relationship between ACE gene polymorphism and antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibitors (Benazepril 10 mg/day or Perindopril 4 mg/day) in 83 NIDDM patients with overt proteinuria (urinary protein excretion over 500 mg/day).
We recruited NIDDM patients with overt proteinuria from our renal clinic. Before entry, previously used ACE inhibitors were withdrawn for at least 2 weeks and baseline proteinuria and albuminuria were measured. Patients were classified into three groups in accordance with ACE genotypes (17 DD; 33 ID; 33 II) and prospectively followed up for 3 months. Various clinical parameters including age, DM duration, body mass index (BMI), 24-h urine sodium, protein and albumin, BUN, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance (Ccr), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and HbA(1c) were measured in the pre- and post-treatment periods. ACE genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction.
There were no significant differences in the clinical parameters such as age, DM duration, BMI, BUN, serum creatinine, Ccr, MAP, HbA(1c), and daily urinary excretion of sodium, protein and albumin among three groups (P>0.05). After the 3-month treatment period using ACE inhibitors, there were no significant differences in the reduction of MAP and Ccr among the three groups (P>0.05). However, the percentage reductions in urinary excretion of protein and albumin for DD genotype were significantly higher than in ID and II genotypes (50.9+/-19.2% vs 19.2+/-16.0%, 20.2+/-20.4%; 52.6+/-23.6% vs. 13.5+/-51.8%, 24.8+/-23.9%, P<0.05). There were no statistically significant correlations between the levels of baseline proteinuria and albuminuria and the magnitudes of the reduction of proteinuria and albuminuria under ACE inhibition (P>0.05).
Our results suggest that the ACE gene polymorphism might have a role in determining the responsiveness to the antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibition in proteinuric NIDDM patients.
Ifosfamide (1.25 g/m2 intravenously/day x 5) with mesna (20% of the ifosfamide dose x six doses on each day of ifosfamide therapy) was administered to 46 previously treated patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of which 31 were eligible and evaluable. A 29% response rate (9/31) was observed (2 CR and 7 PR) with a median duration of response of 2.5 months. Myelosuppression was dose-limiting. Hemorrhagic cystitis was observed in three patients (10%). Nausea and vomiting was generally mild or moderate. One patient developed transient neurotoxic symptoms with confusion and disorientation. An additional patient developed an anaphylactic-type reaction with shortness of breath and respiratory strider during the fourth course of therapy. Ifosfamide, as a single agent, produces remissions of limited duration in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients in second or third relapse.
The most characteristic manifestation of minimal-change nephropathy is podocyte cell process broadening. In a previous study in children from our unit, we found an inverse correlation between foot process width, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and filtration fraction. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this relationship also existed in the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) experimental model.
Sixteen Munich-Wistar-Frömter male rats initially weighing median 247 g (range 171-286) were used. Four rats served as controls. The other 12 rats were divided into three groups receiving daily subcutaneous injections of 1, 1.67, and 2.5 mg PAN/100 g body weight respectively, for 6 days. GFR was determined by clearance of inulin and the fractional urine albumin excretion was measured. Standard stereological methods were used to estimate the glomerular volume, the mean foot process width and the length density of slit pores.
GFR decreased with increasing PAN doses. The glomerular volume was increased in the group receiving the lowest PAN dose, while it was decreased in the group with the highest PAN dose, compared with controls. The fractional albumin excretion and the foot process width increased and the total slit pore length decreased with increasing doses of PAN. GFR correlated directly with the glomerular volume as did the foot process width with the fractional albumin excretion. The foot process width correlated inversely with the glomerular volume as did the glomerular volume with the fractional albumin excretion, and GFR with foot process width.
The decreased GFR found in the nephrotic rats was inversely related to foot process width and directly related to glomerular volume, confirming our previous results in children in an early stage of the nephrotic syndrome.
General anesthesia produces multiple end points including immobility, hypnosis, sedation, and amnesia. Tonic inhibition via gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) may play a role in mediating behavioral end points that are suppressed by low concentrations of anesthetics (e.g., hypnosis and amnesia). GABA(A)-Rs containing the alpha4 subunit are highly concentrated in the hippocampus and thalamus, and when combined with delta subunits they mediate tonic inhibition, which is sensitive to low concentrations of isoflurane.
In this study, we used a GABA(A) alpha4 receptor knockout mouse line to evaluate the contribution of alpha4-containing GABA(A)-Rs to the effects of immobility, hypnosis, and amnesia produced by isoflurane. Knockout mice and their wild-type counterparts were assessed on 3 behavioral tests: conditional fear (to assess amnesia), loss of righting reflex (to assess hypnosis), and the minimum alveolar concentration of inhaled anesthetic necessary to produce immobility in response to noxious stimulation in 50% of subjects (to assess immobility).
Genetic inactivation of the alpha4 subunit reduced the amnestic effect of isoflurane, minimally affected loss of righting reflex, and had no effect on immobility.
These results lend support to the hypothesis that different sites of action mediate different anesthetic end points and suggest that alpha4-containing GABA(A)-Rs are important mediators of the amnestic effect of isoflurane on hippocampal-dependent declarative memory.
In part III of a series of papers on epidemiology and drug prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic complications of atrial fibrillation the authors present data on clinical pharmacology of aspirin as well as discussion of results of randomized trials in which cerebroprotective efficacy and safety of the use of aspirin for primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolism was studied in comparison with placebo and warfarin. According to cumulative data of 6 randomized studies average stroke risk lowering caused by aspirin was 22%. In primary prevention of stroke aspirin did not increase substantially frequency of serious bleedings. However in secondary prevention trials its use was associated with significant increase of serious bleeding rates. Thus in patients with atrial fibrillation aspirin compared with warfarin less effectively prevents stroke but causes fewer serious bleedings.
It is still not commonly realized that immediate hypersensitivity reactions to hydrocortisone can occur. A rare case is reported which illustrates the need for caution when using this drug in atopic subjects. Ideally, parenteral hydrocortisone should only be used where facilities for resuscitation are available.
ET-495, a putative central dopamine receptor stimulant, was givem to endogenously depressed individuals, all of whom were largely unresponsive to previous drug treatment. The drug exhibited a rapid and, in some cases, a pronounced antidepressant effect. This effect was short-lived, however, and, within a brief period, depression returned accompanied by a consistent syndrome of anger, irritability, hostility and poor temper control. In one individual with a bipolar history, the induction of a paranoid psychosis and auditory hallucinosis occurred. While the data suggests a role for dopamine in the symptomatic relief of depression in man, they also imply that this monoamine cannot, in and of itself, be considered as the primum movens in either the action of other (established) antidepressant drugs, or as underlying depressive illness.
Corticosteroid treatment is an important therapeutic modality for many pediatric medical conditions including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, steroid-induced behavioral and mood abnormalities are common and potentially disabling adverse effects that have been widely reported in the pediatric literature. From this case series, we report the efficacy of risperidone in 3 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed steroid-related mood and psychotic symptoms during treatment with prednisone and dexamethasone. Risperidone is an effective short-term pharmacologic agent for controlling steroid-related psychiatric adverse effects when cessation or dose reduction of steroid therapy is not an option.
We present a case report of cyclophosphamide-induced bladder tumor. The patient is a 31-year old male who had received 240 g of cyclophosphamide for 8 years because of the therapy for Wegener's granuloma. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed and transitional cell carcinoma pT1G2 ascertained by histological examination. Forty-three foreign cases and nine Japanese cases including our case are herein reviewed.
Although intracoronary stent implantation significantly reduces restenosis compared with balloon angioplasty, a minority of patients still develop restenosis predominantly due to neointimal hyperplasia. Experimental studies suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is involved in neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. In humans, the plasma and cellular levels of ACE are associated with an I/D genetic polymorphism in the ACE gene, DD patients having higher levels.
We investigated a possible relation between the ACE I/D polymorphism and restenosis in 146 patients who underwent successful implantation of a Palmaz-Schatz stent and had 6-month follow-up angiography. The minimal lumen diameter (MLD) before and after the procedure did not differ significantly among the three groups of genotypes (DD, ID, and II). At follow-up, MLD had a significant inverse relationship to the number of D alleles present (DD, 1.65 +/- 0.71 mm; ID, 1.84 +/- 0.60 mm; II, 2.05 +/- 0.61 mm; P < .007). Late luminal loss during the follow-up period was significantly related to the number of D alleles (DD, 0.89 +/- 0.61 mm; ID, 0.60 +/- 0.52 mm; II, 0.40 +/- 0.53 mm; P < .0001). The relative risk of restenosis (defined as a > 50% diameter stenosis at follow-up) approximated by the adjusted odds ratio was 2.00 per number of D alleles (95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 3.88, P < .04).
The ACE I/D polymorphism influences the level of late luminal loss after coronary stent implantation. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system may be implicated in the pathogenesis of restenosis after coronary stenting.
The case is presented of a 63-year-old man with a long history of degenerative arthritis who took sulindac (Clinoril) 200 mg BID for 6 months with no untoward effects. Then, without physician knowledge, he began using 90% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) topically to his upper and lower extremities. Shortly thereafter, he developed a profound mixed sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Serial electromyographic and nerve conducion studies performed at intervals of several months for 1 year suggested both segmental demyelination and axonal neuropathy. The patient experienced initial deterioration followed by gradual but incomplete recovery.
Osmotic demyelinating syndromes consisting of central pontine and extra-pontine demyelination are very uncommon disorders characterized by non-inflammatory lesions involving the pons and sometimes spreading to other areas. Rapid changes in serum sodium concentration are usually regarded as the main pathophysiological mechanism. We report herein the case of a 23-year-old woman in the 24th week of pregnancy, who demonstrated both central pontine and extra-pontine demyelination occurring at the time of a recently introduced treatment with lithium. The disorder was related to the rapid correction of pregnancy-related hyponatremia, as a consequence of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus. Hence, lithium toxicity is a rare cause of osmotic demyelinating syndromes and appears to correlate with disturbances in sodium homeostasia.
Studies were carried out on the metabolism of lipid peroxides and antioxidative enzymes during diabetes and diabetes superimposed with myocardial infarction. Diabetes was induced using alloxan and myocardial infarction was induced by isoproterenol. In the case of diabetic animals there was a decrease in the levels of lipid peroxides in the heart while in the case of diabetes associated with myocardial infarction it was slightly elevated. The activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase showed a decrease in both the groups. Glutathione showed a fall in the case of diabetes and diabetes associated with myocardial infarction while taurine in heart and ceruloplasmin in the serum was elevated. Histopathological changes in the heart tissue showed some focal changes in the case of both diabetes and diabetes associated with myocardial infarction, but the degree of necrosis was much less than in the case of myocardial infarction.
Previous studies suggested that one possible mechanism of doxorubicin (DXR)-induced cardiomyopathy involves the depletion of high-energy phosphate stores. In this study, we used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance to assess the high-energy phosphate content in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. Hearts were perfused in normoxic conditions (spontaneous flow) or in partially hypoxic conditions obtained by perfusing at 50% of the spontaneous flow. DXR was used at the subtoxic conditions of 50 mg/l for 15 min and at the cardiotoxic concentration of 100 mg/l for 60 min. Left ventricular pressure (dP/dt), heart rate, myocardial ATP and PCr levels and PCr/ATP ratio were measured. We found that, in normoxic conditions, DXR (50 mg/l, 15 min) does not impair cellular high-energy phosphate metabolism. However, in mild hypoxic conditions, DXR induces a significant decrease in PCr/ATP ratio, due to a decrease in PCr and to a simultaneous increase in ATP. Similar results are obtained after 60 min perfusion with the cardiotoxic dose of DXR. This study suggests that hypoxia may represent a risk factor for the development of DXR-induced acute cardiotoxicity.
Dissemination of tumor to the leptomeninges and cerebrospinal fluid represents a common pattern of metastasis for many cancers; however, few chemotherapeutic agents are available for intrathecal (i.t.) use and treatment results are often poor. We studied the neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics of i.t. 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) in the rabbit and the activity of i.t. 4-HC in a VX2 rabbit model of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis to evaluate the potential use of 4-HC in the treatment of leptomeningeal tumors. Toxicity studies examined 4-HC doses ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 mumol administered by intraventricular injection weekly for 4 to 8 weeks. Clinical or histological neurotoxicity was not observed in rabbits treated with < 1.0 mumol 4-HC for 4 weeks. Clinical toxicity, characterized by lethargy, weight loss, seizures, or death, was apparent at doses > 2.0 mumol. Vasculitis of superficial arteries was observed in rabbits treated with > 1.0 mumol 4-HC. In cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetic studies, the mean drug half-life after intraventricular or intralumbar administration was 24.3 and 18.2 min. Regional inequities in drug exposure were apparent as area under the clearance curve values for cerebrospinal fluid distant from the injection site were lower than those of proximate sites (P < 0.001). Weekly intraventricular treatment of VX2 leptomeningeal tumor-bearing rabbits with 0.5 or 1.0 mumol of 4-HC resulted in an increased life span of 22.5 and 35%, respectively. These results indicate that i.t. 4-HC, at doses lower than those producing neurotoxicity in the rabbit, is effective treatment for VX2 leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
Doxazosin, an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, in its standard formulation requires a multiple-step titration regimen to minimize the potential for first-dose effects. A new controlled-release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin was developed to enhance the pharmacokinetic profile, significantly reducing serum peak-to-trough ratios, thereby minimizing the need for titration. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of doxazosin GITS compared with doxazosin standard and placebo in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-titration, multicenter study of 392 patients with mild hypertension (blood pressure [BP] < or = 180/95-105 mmHg). Patients were randomized to doxazosin GITS, doxazosin standard, or placebo in 2:2:1 manner. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients in the per-protocol analysis (PPA) who achieved goal BP response (sitting BP < or = 90 mmg or 10 mmHg decrease from baseline at 24 h postdose at the final evaluable visit). Goal BP response in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and prespecified BP and/or heart rate changes in the PPA and/or ITT population were also analyzed. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study. Doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard produced comparable goal BP responses superior to that of placebo, with 92 of 156 patients (59.0%) on doxazosin GITS and 86 of 152 patients (56.6%) on doxazosin standard in the PPA population achieving goal BP response 24 hours postdose on the final visit, compared with 25 of 70 patients (35.7%) on placebo. Both active treatments produced mean significant BP reductions compared with baseline and placebo (p < 0.001). The most commonly reported side effects were headache, dizziness, and asthenia. No syncope was reported in the doxazosin GITS group; two cases were observed in the doxazosin standard group and one case in the placebo group. Doxazosin GITS was well tolerated and as effective as doxazosin standard in patients with mild hypertension, producing well-tolerated, comparable BP reductions with minimal need for titration. Both active treatments were clinically and statistically superior to placebo.
The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is a potent growth suppressor and proapototic factor, whereas aberrant fusions of PML and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-alpha are causal agents in human acute promyelocytic leukemia. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) treatment induces apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells through an incompletely understood mechanism. We report here that As(2)O(3) treatment induces phosphorylation of the PML protein through a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Increased PML phosphorylation is associated with increased sumoylation of PML and increased PML-mediated apoptosis. Conversely, MAP kinase cascade inhibitors, or the introduction of phosphorylation or sumoylation-defective mutations of PML, impair As(2)O(3)-mediated apoptosis by PML. We conclude that phosphorylation by MAP kinase cascades potentiates the antiproliferative functions of PML and helps mediate the proapoptotic effects of As(2)O(3).
Findings from the phase 3 FLEX study showed that the addition of cetuximab to cisplatin and vinorelbine significantly improved overall survival, compared with cisplatin and vinorelbine alone, in the first-line treatment of EGFR-expressing, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated whether candidate biomarkers were predictive for the efficacy of chemotherapy plus cetuximab in this setting.
Genomic DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue of patients enrolled in the FLEX study was screened for KRAS codon 12 and 13 and EGFR kinase domain mutations with PCR-based assays. In FFPE tissue sections, EGFR copy number was assessed by dual-colour fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry. Treatment outcome was investigated according to biomarker status in all available samples from patients in the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint in the FLEX study was overall survival. The FLEX study, which is ongoing but not recruiting participants, is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00148798.
KRAS mutations were detected in 75 of 395 (19%) tumours and activating EGFR mutations in 64 of 436 (15%). EGFR copy number was scored as increased in 102 of 279 (37%) tumours and PTEN expression as negative in 107 of 303 (35%). Comparisons of treatment outcome between the two groups (chemotherapy plus cetuximab vs chemotherapy alone) according to biomarker status provided no indication that these biomarkers were of predictive value. Activating EGFR mutations were identified as indicators of good prognosis, with patients in both treatment groups whose tumours carried such mutations having improved survival compared with those whose tumours did not (chemotherapy plus cetuximab: median 17·5 months [95% CI 11·7-23·4] vs 8·5 months [7·1-10·8], hazard ratio [HR] 0·52 [0·32-0·84], p=0·0063; chemotherapy alone: 23·8 months [15·2-not reached] vs 10·0 months [8·7-11·0], HR 0·35 [0·21-0·59], p<0·0001). Expression of PTEN seemed to be a potential indicator of good prognosis, with patients whose tumours expressed PTEN having improved survival compared with those whose tumours did not, although this finding was not significant (chemotherapy plus cetuximab: median 11·4 months [8·6-13·6] vs 6·8 months [5·9-12·7], HR 0·80 [0·55-1·16], p=0·24; chemotherapy alone: 11·0 months [9·2-12·6] vs 9·3 months [7·6-11·9], HR 0·77 [0·54-1·10], p=0·16).
The efficacy of chemotherapy plus cetuximab in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC seems to be independent of each of the biomarkers assessed.
