The phenomenon of aging is known to modulate many disease conditions including neurodegenerative ailments like Parkinson's disease (PD) which is characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies have reported on such effects, as calorie restriction, in modulating aging in living systems. We reason that PD, being an age-associated neurodegenerative disease might be modulated by interventions like calorie restriction. In the present study we employed the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model (P(dat-1)::GFP) expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) specifically in eight dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was induced by treatment of worms with 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA), a selective catecholaminergic neurotoxin, followed by studies on effect of calorie restriction on the neurodegeneration. Employing confocal microscopy of the dopaminergic neurons and HPLC analysis of dopamine levels in the nematodes, we found that calorie restriction has a preventive effect on dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the worm model. We further studied the role of sirtuin, sir-2.1, in modulating such an effect. Studies employing RNAi induced gene silencing of nematode sir-2.1, revealed that presence of Sir-2.1 is necessary for achieving the protective effect of calorie restriction on dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Our studies provide evidence that calorie restriction affords, an sir-2.1 mediated, protection against the dopaminergic neurodegeneration, that might have implications for neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease.
The clinical picture of HAT (heparin-associated thrombocytopenia) is being described in reference to a typical case report. If not recognized in time, HAT may lead to serious thrombo-embolic complications, which may eventually lead to death. Considering the wide applications of routine heparin in therapy and prophylaxis, HAT deservers more clinical attention. Routine monitoring of platelet counts during heparin treatment is crucial and essential.
The effects of propranolol and verapamil on contractile dysfunction, subcellular remodeling and changes in gene expression in cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload were examined. Rats were subjected to banding of the abdominal aorta and then treated with either propranolol (10 mg/kg daily), verapamil (5 mg/kg daily) or vehicle for 8 weeks after the surgery. Depression of the left ventricular function in the hypertrophied heart was associated with decreases in myofibrillar and myosin Ca2+ ATPase activities as well as Ca2+-pump and Ca2+-release activities of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The level of alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) mRNA was decreased while that of beta-MHC mRNA was increased in the pressure-overloaded heart. The level of SR Ca2+-pump ATPase (SERCA2) mRNA and protein content for SERCA2 were decreased in the pressure overloaded heart. Treatment of the hypertrophied animals with propranolol or verapamil resulted in preservation of the left ventricular function and prevention of the subcellular alterations. Shift in the alpha- and beta-MHC mRNA levels and changes in the expression in SERCA2 mRNA level and protein content were also attenuated by these treatments. The results suggest that blockade of beta-adrenoceptors or voltage-dependent calcium channels normalizes the cardiac gene expression, prevents subcellular remodeling and thus attenuates heart dysfunction in rats with cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, both cardiac beta-adrenoceptors and L-type Ca2+-channels may be involved in the genesis of cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload.
Human and natural activities release many pollutants in the marine environment. The mixture of pollutants can affect many organisms concurrently. We used Paracentrotus lividus as a model to analyze the effects on signal transduction pathways and stress gene expression in embryos exposed continuously to double stress, i.e., cadmium (Cd) from fertilization and UVB at cleavage (Cd/UVB-embryos). By microscopical inspection, we evaluated embryonic morphology after 72 h of development. Tissue-specific markers were used to assess mesoderm differentiation by immunofluorescence. We analyzed p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK activation by Western blot and mRNA profiles of Pl-MT, Pl-14-3-3epsilon, and Pl-jun genes by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the localization of their transcripts by whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH). We found that the Cd/UVB combined exposure induced morphological malformations in 76% of pluteus embryos, mainly affecting the development of the skeleton, including the normal branching of skeletal roads. In Cd/UVB-embryos, p38MAPK was activated 1 h after UVB exposure and a remarkable overexpression of the Pl-MT, Pl-14.3.3epsilon, and Pl-jun genes 24 h after UVB exposure. Pl-MT and Pl-14.3.3epsilon mRNAs were misexpressed as they were localized in a position different from that observed in wild-type embryos, i.e., the intestine. On the contrary, Pl-jun mRNA has remained localized in the skeletogenic cells despite their displacement in exposed embryos. In conclusion, Cd/UVB exposure affected skeletal patterning producing alternative morphologies in which p38MAPK activation and Pl-MT, Pl-14.3.3epsilon, and Pl-jun gene overexpression seem linked to a protective role against the stress response induced by Cd/UVB.
Parkinson's disease (PD)-mimicking drugs and pesticides, and more recently PD-associated gene mutations, have been studied in cell cultures and mammalian models to decipher the molecular basis of PD. Thus far, a dozen of genes have been identified that are responsible for inherited PD. However they only account for about 8% of PD cases, most of the cases likely involving environmental contributions. Environmental manganese (Mn) exposure represents an established risk factor for PD occurrence, and both PD and Mn-intoxicated patients display a characteristic extrapyramidal syndrome primarily involving dopaminergic (DAergic) neurodegeneration with shared common molecular mechanisms. To better understand the specificity of DAergic neurodegeneration, we studied Mn toxicity in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans. Combining genetics and biochemical assays, we established that extracellular, and not intracellular, dopamine (DA) is responsible for Mn-induced DAergic neurodegeneration and that this process (1) requires functional DA-reuptake transporter (DAT-1) and (2) is associated with oxidative stress and lifespan reduction. Overexpression of the anti-oxidant transcription factor, SKN-1, affords protection against Mn toxicity, while the DA-dependency of Mn toxicity requires the NADPH dual-oxidase BLI-3. These results suggest that in vivo BLI-3 activity promotes the conversion of extracellular DA into toxic reactive species, which, in turn, can be taken up by DAT-1 in DAergic neurons, thus leading to oxidative stress and cell degeneration.
We have studied the effect of gender, genetics, and toxicokinetics on immune parameters in mercury-induced autoimmunity in mice. Data strongly suggest that the mechanism for mercury-induced autoimmunity involves modification of the autoantigen fibrillarin by mercury followed by a T-cell-dependent immune response driven by the modified fibrillarin. Mice with different H-2 haplotypes were treated with (203)HgCl(2) in a dose of 0.5-16 mg Hg/L drinking water for 10 weeks. Whole-body accumulation and renal accumulation of mercury were assessed. Serum antinuclear antibodies were used to evaluate the autoimmune response, and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) to study effects on T-helper cells of type 2. Strains with a susceptible H-2 haplotype developed autoantibodies to the nucleolar protein fibrillarin (AFA) in a dose-dependent pattern within 2 weeks. The substantially lower whole-body and organ mercury level needed to induce AFA in the susceptible A.SW strain compared with the H-2 congenic B10.S strain demonstrates that genetic factors outside the H-2 region modify the autoimmune response. Mouse strains without the susceptible haplotype did not develop any autoimmune reaction irrespective of dose and organ deposition of mercury. In susceptible mouse strains, males and females had different thresholds for induction of autoimmune reactions. In susceptible strains, serum IgE increased dose dependently and reached a maximum after 1-2.5 weeks. A susceptible H-2 haplotype is therefore a prerequisite for the autoimmune response. Mercury exposure will modulate the response, qualitatively through the existence of dose-related thresholds for autoimmune response and quantitatively as increasing doses cause increasing autoimmune response. Further, gender and non-H-2 genes modulate both the induction and subsequent development of AFA. Induction of IgE seems not to be mechanistically linked to the AFA response.
Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of trazodone, a patient developed complete heart block. The case illustrates that, despite the results of earlier studies, trazodone's effect on cardiac conduction may be severe in individuals at risk for conduction delay.
Hematologic side effects (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) of combination therapy with pegylated (PEG)-interferon alfa and ribavirin are commonly encountered during antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C (HCV). An important consequence of these side effects is dose modification of PEG-interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. Dose modification (including discontinuation) diminishes the efficacy of optimal treatment regimen for HCV and may have a negative impact on sustained virologic response. Additionally, fatigue associated with anemia may impair patients' quality of life. The clinical implications of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia are less clear than for anemia; nevertheless, severe infection and bleeding are uncommon. Dose adjustments effectively treat these hematologic side effects, but the resulting suboptimal dosing and potential impact on virologic response are major concerns. Recent attempts to maximize adherence to the optimal treatment regimen have used hematopoietic growth factors rather than dose adjustment to treat side effects. Research on growth factor support has focused on anemia and neutropenia. Epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are erythropoietic growth factors that effectively increase hemoglobin while maintaining the optimal ribavirin dose and improving patients' quality of life. Preliminary work suggests that filgrastim, granulocyte colony stimulating factors, may be an effective treatment of interferon-induced neutropenia. Although this early work shows tremendous promise for managing hematologic side effects of combination therapy for HCV, and potentially enhancing adherence, further research is needed to clarify the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of growth factors in the management of patients with chronic HCV.
A greater knowledge of the neurochemical changes occurring during pain states will undoubtedly aid in the discovery of effective pain pharmacotherapies. This study highlights the acute effects of inflammatory agents on neurochemical changes in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), a supraspinal site involved in the processing of painful stimuli. Consistent with previous reports, a peripheral injection of 0.1 mg prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) into the intraplantar area of the rat paw produced thermal hypersensitivity that peaked 10 min after administration. In vivo microdialysis studies in the same animals revealed that this behavioral response correlated with a greater than 2-fold increase (230%) in extracellular serotonin (5-HT) levels in the RVM. In contrast, levels of other neurotransmitters measured, including norepinephrine and dopamine, were not altered in animals receiving this inflammatory agent. Similar to PGE(2), an intraplantar injection of capsaicin (0.1 mg) produced a robust thermal hypersensitivity that was paralleled by a 3-fold increase in levels of 5-HT in the RVM. The next series of experiments showed that acute administration of the opioid analgesic, morphine (5.6 mg/kg; IP), attenuated PGE(2)-induced thermal hypersensitivity and reversed the increase in extracellular 5-HT observed in the RVM. Taken together, these findings extend previous reports of central neurochemical changes during inflammatory pain conditions and show that the combination of behavioral endpoints with microdialysis can yield important insights into the neurochemical environment of the pain circuitry.
To identify risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage, we designed a case-control study of men and women 18 to 49 years of age (the Hemorrhagic Stroke Project [HSP]). This report focuses on SAH.
Patients were recruited from 44 hospitals in the United States. Cases with SAH must have had a ruptured aneurysm documented by angiography or surgery. Two controls, identified by random digit dialing and matched to each patient for age, sex, race, and telephone exchange, were sought for each case subject.
Between 1994 and 1999, 425 patients with SAH were enrolled in HSP, and 312 cases met the criteria for aneurysmal SAH. The present analyses also included 618 matched controls. Of the 312 cases, 66% were current cigarette smokers compared with 30% of controls (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.73; 95% CI, 2.67 to 5.21). Cocaine use within the previous 3-day period was reported by 3% of cases and no controls (bivariate exact OR, 24.97; 95% exact CI, 3.95 to infinity; adjusted estimate not calculable). Other independent risk factors in the multivariable model included hypertension (adjusted OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.48 to 3.29), low body mass index (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.35), primary family history of hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.73 to 8.46), caffeine in pharmaceutical products (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.19 to 5.20), lower educational achievement (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.87), and nicotine in pharmaceutical products (adjusted estimate not calculable).
Aneurysmal SAH may be largely a preventable disease among the young and middle-aged because several prevalent risk factors can be modified by medication (eg, hypertension) or behavioral change (eg, cigarette smoking, cocaine use). The association of caffeine and nicotine in pharmaceutical products and aneurysmal SAH warrants further study.
To characterize the long-term effects of calcium antagonists on renal function in hypertension felodipine was used to treat 14 patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension associated with renal functional impairment: six patients had renal parenchymal hypertension, six had essential hypertension and two had renovascular hypertension. Mean blood pressure was 197 +/- 2/115 +/- 3 mm Hg despite treatment with three or more antihypertensive drugs. Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 39 +/- 6 ml/min (Cr-EDTA clearance) before initiation of felodipine treatment. All patients experienced a blood pressure reduction after starting felodipine treatment, which persisted during long-term therapy in combination with previous medication except former vasodilating drugs. Blood pressure after 12 and 24 months was 152 +/- 7/89 +/- 2 and 157 +/- 5/90 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. Patients with moderately impaired GFR and absence of progressive renal disease (N = 8) manifested an increase in GFR after 6 and 12 months on felodipine (59 +/- 10 to 63 +/- 7 and 70 +/- 6 ml/min, respectively, P less than 0.05). Renal plasma flow (PAH clearance) exhibited only a slight increase (315 +/- 68 to 340 +/- 63 and 314 +/- 69 ml/min) with a consequent increase in filtration fraction (18 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 and 20 +/- 1%, NS). At follow-up after six to eight years patients with initial GFR greater than or equal to 50 ml/min had a maintained renal function. In five patients a progressive deterioration of renal function had been documented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics used by dental practitioners in the treatment of periodontal disease. They generally are safe in adults. However, caution is advised in patients who have pre-existing kidney disease.
A 42-year-old woman with polycystic kidney disease received a prescription for tetracycline (250 milligrams, four times daily) after undergoing tooth extractions. She developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhea within days and end-stage renal disease within two weeks of taking the antibiotic. Hemodialysis was required to stabilize the patient's condition. Use of the Naranjo nomogram demonstrated an association between the two events.
This case illustrates the importance of obtaining a thorough medical history and understanding potential adverse drug effects before prescribing a common antibiotic.
Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug that causes severe cardiomyopathy. We have previously demonstrated that ADR-induced ultrastructural mitochondrial injury in the heart was attenuated in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) transgenic mice. To further investigate the biochemical mechanisms by which MnSOD protected mitochondria against ADR-induced damage, cardiac mitochondrial function and activities were evaluated. The results showed that ADR caused significant decrease in state 3 respiration and respiratory control ratio using both complex I and II substrates in nontransgenic mice. In transgenic mice, state 3 respiration for complex I substrates remained unaffected by ADR, but was reduced for complex II substrate. Complex I activity was significantly decreased in nontransgenic, but not in transgenic mice after ADR treatment, suggesting that mitochondrial complex I is sensitive to inactivation by superoxide radicals. The activities of complex II and mitochondrial creatine kinase were decreased by ADR in both nontransgenic and transgenic mice. These results support our previous observations on the protective role of MnSOD on the ultrastructural damage of the heart after ADR treatment and extend the understanding of its mechanisms in mitochondria.
Triflumizole (TFZ) is an imidazole fungicide used on many food and ornamental crops. TFZ is not thought to be particularly toxic or carcinogenic, but little is known about its effect on development. TFZ is identified as a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activator in ToxCast. Because PPARγ is a master regulator of adipogenesis, we hypothesized that TFZ would activate PPARγ, thereby inducing adipogenesis and weight gain in vivo.
We sought to test the ability of TFZ to activate PPARγ and promote adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo.
We used transient transfection to test the ability of TFZ to activate PPARγ, and we used 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and human multipotent mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) to study the adipogenic capacity of TFZ in culture. We treated pregnant mice with three doses of TFZ and evaluated the effects on body weight, adipose depot weight, and MSC programming in the prenatally exposed offspring.
TFZ induced adipogenesis in MSCs and in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Prenatal exposure to levels of TFZ at approximately 400-fold below the reported no observed adverse effect level increased adipose depot weight. All doses of TFZ tested increased adipogenic gene expression in MSCs while inhibiting expression of osteogenic genes.
TFZ acts through a PPARγ-dependent mechanism to induce adipogenic differentiation in MSCs and preadipocytes at low nanomolar concentrations. Prenatal TFZ exposure increases adipose depot weight and diverts MSC fate toward the adipocyte lineage; therefore, we conclude that TFZ is an obesogen in vivo.
Apoptosis in megakaryocytes results in the formation of platelets. The role of apoptotic pathways in platelet turnover and in the apoptotic-like changes seen after platelet activation is poorly understood. ABT-263 (Navitoclax), a specific inhibitor of antiapoptotic BCL2 proteins, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies, induces a dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. In this study, the relationship between BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibition, apoptosis, and platelet activation was investigated. Exposure to ABT-263 induced apoptosis but repressed platelet activation by physiologic agonists. Notably, ABT-263 induced an immediate calcium response in platelets and the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, indicating that on BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibition platelet activation is abrogated because of a diminished calcium signaling. By comparing the effects of ABT-263 and its analog ABT-737 on platelets and leukemia cells from the same donor, we show, for the first time, that these BCL2/BCL-X(L) inhibitors do not offer any selective toxicity but induce apoptosis at similar concentrations in leukemia cells and platelets. However, reticulated platelets are less sensitive to apoptosis, supporting the hypothesis that treatment with ABT-263 induces a selective loss of older platelets and providing an explanation for the transient thrombocytopenia observed on ABT-263 treatment.
The effects of adenosine and sodium-nitroprusside (SNP) on central and myocardial haemodynamics and metabolism were evaluated during fentanyl anaesthesia (100 micrograms.kg-1) in six patients with peripheral vascular disease. The investigation was performed during stable anaesthesia, before scheduled abdominal aortic graft surgery. Adenosine and SNP were infused intravenously in random order over 20 min, leaving a 30-min control period in between. The vasodilators were titrated in order to reduce mean arterial pressure by approximately 25%. Adenosine (90 +/- 20 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) reduced mean arterial pressure from 10.9 +/- 0.3 to 8.4 +/- 0.4 kPa (82 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 3 mmHg), and SNP (0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) from 11.0 +/- 0.2 to 8.4 +/- 0.3 kPa (83 +/- 3 mmHg to 63 +/- 3 mmHg), during the hypotension period. Cardiac index remained unaffected during induced hypotension with both vasodilators, while heart rate increased during SNP infusion (8 +/- 3%) and remained unaffected with adenosine. Left ventricular stroke work index and myocardial oxygen consumption decreased during SNP infusion (33 +/- 3% and 17 +/- 5%, respectively), while these parameters were unchanged with adenosine. Adenosine hypotension increased coronary sinus flow 1-2 fold (128 +/- 26%), together with increased coronary sinus oxygen content (96 +/- 11%). In contrast, coronary sinus flow decreased during SNP hypotension (-15 +/- 4%) with unaffected coronary sinus oxygen content. It is concluded that adenosine, in contrast to SNP, is associated with a hyperkinetic myocardial circulation.
The diagnosis of halothane hepatitis (HH) may be assisted by detection of antibodies reacting to trifluoroacetylated proteins (anti-TFA antibodies). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing trifluoroacetylated rabbit serum albumin (TFA-RSA) as antigen detected anti-TFA antibodies in 67% of sera from patients for whom a clinical diagnosis of HH was made. Anti-TFA antibodies were detected in 33% of sera when using an ELISA with liver microsomal protein from halothane-treated rabbits as antigen. Absorption of the sera with untreated rabbit liver microsomal protein before using the microsomal protein ELISA resulted in detection of anti-TFA antibodies in 42% of sera. Using the presumptive hapten N-epsilon-trifluoroacetyl-1-lysine to block antibody binding in an ELISA resulted in positive detection in 50% of sera: the results did not always agree with the other ELISA methods. The TFA-RSA ELISA was the most sensitive method and, combined with the TFA-lysine blocking ELISA, resulted in 92% of sera from HH patients testing positive for HH-associated antibodies.
To compare the frequency of adverse events, particularly neuropsychiatric effects, from mefloquine and from chloroquine plus proguanil as used for malaria chemoprophylaxis.
Retrospective questionnaire to travellers taking either regimen between November 1993 and February 1995; telephone interview with those reporting pronounced side effects.
Travellers from Britain who consulted an advisory helpline.
1214 adults taking mefloquine and 1181 taking chloroquine plus proguanil.
Reported presence of and degree of disability from 12 neuropsychiatric and other symptoms, as assessed by the subjects and by referees and on the basis of behaviour change.
There were equal rates of any side effects (40%) and of stopping or changing medication. Overall, neuropsychiatric adverse events were significantly more common in travellers taking mefloquine. In all, 333 neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported by 1214 travellers taking mefloquine, compared with 189 such events in 1181 travellers taking proguanil plus chloroquine (P < 0.001). In all, 0.7% of travellers taking mefloquine had disabling neuropsychiatric adverse effects, compared with 0.09% of those taking proguanil plus chloroquine (P = 0.021). Two travellers taking mefloquine (1 in 607) were admitted to hospital as a result of the adverse event, compared with 1 in 1181 travellers taking proguanil plus chloroquine.
There is a significant excess of adverse neuropsychiatric events of intermediate degrees of severity associated with the use of mefloquine compared with proguanil plus chloroquine. This finding may also explain the discrepant findings between earlier studies and clinical experience.
Glutathione S-transferases are involved in the conjugation of xenobiotics. To explore whether GSTs polymorphisms are involved in the development of occupational or non-occupational bladder cancer, polymorphism frequencies of GSTT1, M1 and P1 were investigated in a normal population, which had been settled in a rural area in Shanghai suburb for at least 5 generations as well as in a group of patients with benzidine exposure related occupational bladder cancer in Shanghai dyestuff industry and a group of patients with non-occupational bladder cancer.
PCR based procedures were performed in the study populations to confirm the genotypes of GSTT1, M1 and P1.
The polymorphisms at locus of GSTP1-A1578G in the normal population differed significantly from those in Caucasians or African Americans. All the subjects genotyped so far (n = 118) bore only homogenous wild genotype (C2293/C2293) at GSTP1-C2293T locus. This locus seemed to be a monomorphic in Shanghai population. No significant difference in GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphic form frequencies could be confirmed among three groups of subjects. An overrepresentation of GSTP1 AG or GG genotype corresponding a less stable and less effective isozyme protein was detected in patients with benzidine related occupational bladder cancer, compared with that in the normal population though a statistical significance was not yet reached (P = 0.09, OR = 1.96, 95% CI 0.89-4.32).
This study suggests that GSTM1 or GSTT1 homozygous deficiency genotypes and their combination do not have a clear impact on bladder cancer incidence in a Shanghai population. It seems that GSTP1 polymorphism is not associated with non-occupational bladder cancer. GSTP1 AG or GG genotype has a higher frequency in the patients with benzidine related occupational bladder cancer, and further work is needed to confirm if GSTP1 AG or GG genotype plays a role in the development of occupational bladder cancer.
Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic drug rarely associated with torsade de pointes arrhythmias (TdP). The noniodinated compound dronedarone could resemble amiodarone and be devoid of the adverse effects. In the dog with chronic complete atrioventricular (AV) block (CAVB) and acquired long-QT syndrome, the electrophysiological and proarrhythmic properties of the drugs were compared after 4 weeks of oral treatment.
Amiodarone (n=7, 40 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) and dronedarone (n=8, 20 mg/kg BID) were started at 6 weeks of CAVB (baseline). Six dogs served as controls. Surface ECGs and endocardially placed monophasic action potential catheters in the left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles were recorded to assess QTc time, action potential duration (APD), interventricular dispersion (DeltaAPD=LV APD minus RV APD), early afterdepolarizations (EADs), ectopic beats, and TdP. Both amiodarone (+21%) and dronedarone (+31%) increased QTc time. Amiodarone showed no increase in DeltaAPD in 4 of 7 dogs, whereas dronedarone augmented DeltaAPD in 7 of 8 animals. After dronedarone, TdP occurred in 4 of 8 dogs with the highest DeltaAPD (105+/-20 ms). TdP was never seen with amiodarone, not even in the dogs that had DeltaAPD values comparable to those with dronedarone. Furthermore, a difference existed in EADs and ectopic activity incidence (dronedarone 3 of 8; amiodarone 0 of 7), which was also seen during an epinephrine challenge.
In the CAVB dog model, both amiodarone and dronedarone prolong QT time (class III effect). The absence of TdP with amiodarone seems to be related to homogeneous APD lengthening in the majority of dogs and the lack of EADs and/or ventricular ectopic beats in all.
We did a controlled study to assess adverse psychological reactions (APR) associated with high-dose glucocorticoid therapy and tried to detect somatic correlates for the observed reactions.
Our study included 37 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 11 patients with Morbus Hodgkin (MH) disease, who were treated with high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, and 26 control patients with other types of malignancies. APRs were assessed with a standardized measure via parent-report. Patients with ALL and MH were further analyzed for signs of neuronal cell death in the cerebrospinal fluid, polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, as well as cortisol, adrenocorticorticotropic hormone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate blood levels.
Fifty-four percent of ALL, 36% of MH, and 23% of control patients developed APR in the first few weeks of therapy. Approximately 3.5 months later, the majority of patients with ALL showed no APR, similar to control patients. Patients demonstrating a higher, nonsuppressible secretion of cortisol and/or adrenocorticorticotropic hormone during glucocorticoid therapy were found to be more likely to develop APR. No sign of neuronal cell destruction and no correlation of APR with specific glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms were found.
Our results suggest that the development of APR due to glucocorticoid therapy is measurable and correlates with hormonal reaction patterns.
T lymphocytes from patients with visceral leishmaniasis treated in vitro with leishmania antigens are unable to proliferate and to produce gamma interferon. These patients have negative specific skin tests. Opposite results are obtained in patients with another clinical form of the disease named mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, in which both tests are positive. Nevertheless, patients with visceral leishmaniasis or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, refractory to chemotherapy (antimonium complex), were cured when treated with antimonium in combination with gamma interferon, in spite of different immunological profiles. Different interpretative hypotheses of the reversion of chemoresistance induced by gamma interferon are discussed.
