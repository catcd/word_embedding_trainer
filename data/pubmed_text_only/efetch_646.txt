We have compared the incidence of CNS symptoms and changes in echocardiography and electrophysiology during i.v. infusions of ropivacaine, bupivacaine and placebo. Acute tolerance of i.v. infusion of 10 mg min-1 was studied in a crossover, randomized, double-blind study in 12 volunteers previously acquainted with the CNS effects of lignocaine. The maximum tolerated dose for CNS symptoms was higher after ropivacaine in nine of 12 subjects and higher after bupivacaine in three subjects. The 95% confidence limits for the difference in mean dose between ropivacaine and bupivacaine were -30 and 7 mg. The maximum tolerated unbound arterial plasma concentration was twice as high after ropivacaine (P < 0.001). Muscular twitching occurred more frequently after bupivacaine (P < 0.05). The time to disappearance of all symptoms was shorter after ropivacaine (P < 0.05). A threshold for CNS toxicity was apparent at a mean free plasma concentration of approximately 0.6 mg litre-1 for ropivacaine and 0.3 mg litre-1 for bupivacaine. Bupivacaine increased QRS width during sinus rhythm compared with placebo (P < 0.001) and ropivacaine (P < 0.01). Bupivacaine reduced both left ventricular systolic and diastolic function compared with placebo (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), while ropivacaine reduced only systolic function (P < 0.01).
The anti-hyperalgesic action, antinociception, and also the possible mechanisms involved in the action of gallic acid ethyl ester (GAEE) isolated from the aerial part of Phyllanthus urinaria, have been investigated in different models of chemical, mechanical and thermal nociception in mice and rats. GAEE given by intraperitoneal (i.p.), oral (p.o.), intrathecal (i.t.) or by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) routes produced dose-related antinociception when assessed against chemical nociception in mice. GAEE significantly inhibited the hyperalgesia induced by bradykinin or substance P in rat paw, but did not affect the hyperalgesia caused by carrageenan or prostaglandin E2. Furthermore, GAEE, in contrast to morphine, was completely ineffective in the hot-plate test in mice. The antinociception produced by GAEE (i.p.) in the formalin test was significantly reversed by i.c.v. treatment of animals with pertussis toxin and by i.t. administration of K+ channel blockers such as apamin, charybdotoxin or glibenclamide, but not by tetraethylammonium. In contrast, GAEE (i.p.) antinociception was unaffected by i.p. treatment of animals with naloxone or by nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, and this action was not secondary to its anti-inflammatory effect, nor was it associated with non-specific effects such as muscle relaxation or sedation. Thus, GAEE produces dose-dependent and pronounced systemic, spinal and supraspinal antinociception in mice, probably via activation of K + channels and by a Gi/o pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism.
The analgesic action of NSAIDs has been attributed to the peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via the blockade of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and prevention of bradykinin and cytokine-induced hyperalgesia via inhibition of the release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that NSAIDs exert their analgesic effect through several mechanisms. Recent data suggest that significant expression of COX-2 is found in the central nervous system, where COX-2 seems to have, together with nitric oxide, an important role in spinal nociceptive transmission. Nitroglycerin is a nitric oxide donor and induces a hyperalgesic state, partially mediated by central mechanisms. Nimesulide is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor widely used to treat pain. In this study, we evaluated the analgesic effect of nimesulide in several animal models of pain, intending to provide additional information on the characteristics of the analgesic effect of nimesulide, with specific focus on a possible central component.
Nimesulide was compared with vehicle in groups of 4-10 rats that were randomly tested with different models of pain. The experimental design also included study of the effect of nimesulide upon nitroglycerin-induced neuronal activation at central sites. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the influence of time and treatments. Differences between groups at specific time-points were analysed by post-hoc t-test. A probability level of less than 5% was regarded as significant.
The analgesic effect of nimesulide (or vehicle) was evaluated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals underwent tail-flick and formalin tests, both performed in baseline conditions and after nitroglycerin-induced hyperalgesia. Two separate groups of rats were treated with nitroglycerin alone or nimesulide followed by nitroglycerin, and their brains were processed for immunocytochemical detection of Fos protein, a marker of neuronal activation.
Nimesulide showed a significant analgesic effect in both the tail-flick and the formalin tests in baseline conditions. In addition, the drug proved effective in counteracting nitroglycerin-induced hyperalgesia in both tests. Brain mapping of nuclei activated by the administration of nitroglycerin showed that nimesulide pretreatment significantly inhibited neuronal activation in several areas, namely the supraoptic nucleus, ventrolateral column of the periaqueductal grey, locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitarius and area postrema. We conclude that nimesulide possesses a strong analgesic and antihyperalgesic activity, the mechanisms of action of which are partly central.
The goal of this study was to derive a systematic approach for the identification of protein species profiles that selectively identify subgroups of similar but distinct pain models and correlate with the therapeutic efficacy (or lack thereof) of drug intervention.
Using high-throughput surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry proteomic technology based on ProteinChip arrays, we conducted a comparative analysis of the profile of protein expression in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from rats exposed to either injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) [a model of inflammatory pain] or chronic constriction injury (CCI) [a model of neuropathic pain]. The CFA model was then further studied for the effects of treatment with the NSAID, nimesulide (a preferential cyclo-oxygenase [COX]-2 inhibitor).
Among other observations, we found that the content of two metal (copper) binding protein species (2.9 and 3.2kDa) and three anionic protein species (4.0, 6.9 and 8.2kDa) were increased in the CSF of rats with inflammatory pain in a time-dependent fashion, at 7 and 14 days after CFA injection. These changes were highly selective for the CFA model, as no detectable increase in these protein biomarkers was found in the CCI neuropathic pain model. Further, we found that most of the changes in the biomarker protein species induced by the inflammatory pain were prevented by treatment with nimesulide and correlated with the antihyperalgesic effect of this drug.
This study demonstrates that CSF biomarker profiles, as detected by SELDI technology, can consistently and reproducibly differentiate inflammatory from neuropathic pain, and reflect the analgesic action produced by the preferential COX-2 inhibitor, nimesulide. The characterisation and identification of these biomarkers will provide invaluable insight into the pathophysiology of pain mechanisms, in addition to further understanding of the value of nimesulide in the treatment of inflammatory pain.
Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) exists in two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is responsible for homeostatic functions, whereas COX-2 is inducible and responsible for the inflammatory effects of prostaglandins. Nimesulide, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, has been shown to relieve pain rapidly in arthritis. We examined the effect of nimesulide on prostaglandin formation in arthritis, to evaluate if this compound gains access to the site of inflammation and whether this is required for analgesia.
This was a single-dose, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study of nimesulide 100mg compared with diclofenac 50mg.
Serial sampling of synovial fluid, whole blood and plasma was performed at baseline and 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after drug administration. Synovial tissue was obtained by needle biopsy at completion of the study period. Synovial fluid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. COX-1 and COX-2 activities in whole blood were estimated by serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and endotoxin-induced PGE2 concentrations respectively. Synovial tissue COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were studied by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry respectively. Twenty patients with acute knee inflammation on a background of arthritis of all types completed the study.
Patients were allocated randomly to groups to receive nimesulide (n = 10) or diclofenac (n = 10). The mean (+/- SEM) plasma concentration of PGE2 in the nimesulide group decreased from 24.45 +/- 2.71 ng/mL at baseline to 1.74 +/- 2.71 ng/ mL at 2 hours. Diclofenac also inhibited PGE2, but at a later time point (28.15 +/- 2.86 ng/mL at baseline and 0.85 +/- 2.86 ng/mL at 4 hours). The mean (+/- SEM) synovial fluid concentration of PGE2 was 319 +/- 89 pg/mL before treatment; it remained unaltered over 4 hours after the administration of nimesulide or diclofenac (235 +/- 72 pg/mL). In contrast, in six patients receiving long-term treatment with nimesulide or a non-selective NSAID, synovial PGE2 was 61 +/- 24 pg/ mL, suggesting that inhibition of synovial prostaglandin formation is delayed compared with that in plasma. Nimesulide caused partial inhibition of serum TxB2 (a decrease from a mean of 268 +/- 24 ng/mL to one of 164 +/- 27 ng/mL at 2 hours), whereas diclofenac had a greater effect (a decrease from 224 +/- 33 ng/mL, to 76 +/- 27 ng/mL at 3 hours).
Nimesulide, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, has a rapid onset of action in the blood compartment, with early inhibition of PGE2 generation, an index of COX-2 activity. In contrast, it exhibits a delay in achieving therapeutic concentrations in the synovial fluid. Thus factors other than local inhibition of prostaglandins may explain the rapid onset of analgesia that is associated with nimesulide, including a possible central mechanism of pain relief.
Combined effects of alprazolam (Alp), a member of benzodiazepine group of drugs and caffeine on human cell lines, HeLa and THP1 were investigated in this study. Alp mediated cytotoxicity was enhanced while caffeine was present. The cell death was confirmed by observing morphological changes, LDH assay and membrane anisotropic study. Also such combined effects induced elevated level of ROS and depletion of GSH. The mechanism of cell death induced by simultaneous treatment of Alp and caffeine was associated with the calcium-mediated activation of mu-calpain, release of lysosomal protease cathepsin B, activation of PARP and cleavage of caspase 3. Our results indicate that, Alp alone induces apoptosis in human cells but in the presence of caffeine it augments necrosis in a well-regulated pathway. Thus our observations strongly suggest that, alprazolam and caffeine together produce severe cytotoxicity in human cell lines.
To examine the association between the use of psychotropic drugs and fatal pulmonary embolism.
We conducted a national case-control study of fatal pulmonary embolism. Cases were 75 New Zealand men and women aged 15-59 years who died between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1998, where the underlying cause of death was certified as codes 415.1, 451 or 453 of the International Classification of Diseases (9th Revision). Four controls, matched for sex and age, were selected from the general practice to which each case had belonged. Information was abstracted from the records of general practitioners, family planning clinics and psychiatric services. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. The key analyses were restricted to cases (n = 62) and controls (n = 243) without major risk factors for venous thromboembolism.
Compared to non-use, the adjusted odds ratio for current use of antipsychotic drugs was 13.3 (95% CI: 2.3-76.3). Low potency antipsychotics appeared to carry the highest risk (odds ratio: 20.8 [95% CI: 1.7-259.0]). The main drug involved was thioridazine. The odds ratio for current use of antidepressants was also increased, at 4.9 (95% CI: 1.1-22.5).
Our results for conventional antipsychotics are consistent with previous studies of non-fatal venous thromboembolism. The finding for antidepressants needs to be replicated in other studies.
To determine the role of prophylactic N-acetylcysteine in the prevention of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity.
One hundred and sixteen patients undergoing noncoronary angiography, with or without pre-existing renal impairment, were randomly assigned to receive prophylactic oral N-acetylcysteine or no treatment. Serum creatinine (sCr) was measured prior to angiography and 48 hr after the procedure. Urine samples were collected before and after the examination for measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) was defined as a rise in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dl (44 mmol/l) at 48 hr.
Complete data were available on 106 patients, 53 of whom had received N-acetylcysteine. There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics, type of angiogram, or volume and concentration of contrast used. Three patients (2.8%), all of whom had received N-acetylcysteine, developed CIN. In the N-acetylcysteine group, the mean serum creatinine in patients with renal impairment was 151.0 +/- 44.2 micromol/l prior to the procedure and 155.6 +/- 48.6 micromol/l (p = 0.49) after the procedure. Respective values for those without renal impairment were 79.6 +/- 15.1 micromol/l and 81.2 +/- 20.0 micromol/l (p = 0.65). In the group that had not received N-acetylcysteine, the mean serum creatinine levels before and after the procedure were 150.0 +/- 58.1 and 141.4 +/- 48.0 micromol/l (p = 0.17) in patients with renal impairment and 79.7 +/- 14.2 and 81.4 +/- 15.4 micromol/l (p = 0.34) in those without renal impairment. In both groups, no significant change in urinary MDA concentration was observed.
There is no benefit to the prophylactic administration of N-acetylcysteine in patients undergoing peripheral angiography using current contrast media.
Ochratoxin A (OTA), a known nephrotoxin and carcinogenic mycotoxin, was investigated to examine its effectiveness to induce cytotoxicity and DNA damage (Comet assay), as well as its possible inhibition of topoisomerase II (topo II) catalytic activity in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The analysis of OTA-induced DNA strand breaks as well as the flow cytometric assessment of polyploidy has provided evidence that is consistent with the idea of a mixed mode of action of the mycotoxin: in addition to its genotoxic activity, OTA may also interfere with chromosome distribution during cell division.
We report a hemifacial paralysis as an adverse drug reaction possibly related to the use of omeprazole in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We believe that this case, although very rare, is clinically significant and worth mentioning, owing to the frequent use of omeprazole in the oncology setting.
A recently developed algorithm for the diagnosis of adverse drug reaction (ADR) was used to investigate the quality of evidence in reported cases of ADRs to 1% gamma benzene hexachloride (GBH), a popular scabicide and pediculicide currently under suspicion as a cause of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, especially in children. Of the 53 reported cases of alleged toxicity, 37 were associated with lindane insecticide (greater than 1% GBH), which is not a pharmaceutical preparation. Of these 37 cases, 34 scored as definite or probable reactions on the algorithm. Of the 26 reports associated with the drug, 1% GBH, none scored as definite and only 6 as probable ADRs. Of these 6 probable cases, 5 represented inappropriate application or unintended ingestion. The use of rigorous operational criteria, such as those developed in this algorithm, permits a scientifically disciplined assessment of whether or not a drug has been fairly indicted, and also provides valuable clinical information about other aspects of suspected drug toxicity.
Sirolimus, an antiproliferative immunosuppressant, induces hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. Rosiglitazone activates renal sodium- and water-reabsorptive pathways. We evaluated whether sirolimus induces renal wasting of magnesium and potassium, attempting to identify the tubule segments in which this occurs. We tested the hypothesis that reduced expression of the cotransporter NKCC2 forms the molecular basis of this effect and evaluated the possible association between increased urinary excretion of magnesium and renal expression of the epithelial Mg2+ channel TRPM6. We then analyzed whether rosiglitazone attenuates these sirolimus-induced tubular effects. Wistar rats were treated for 14 days with sirolimus (3 mg/kg body wt in drinking water), with or without rosiglitazone (92 mg/kg body wt in food). Protein abundance of NKCC2, aquaporin-2 (AQP2), and TRPM6 was assessed using immunoblotting. Sirolimus-treated animals presented no change in glomerular filtration rate, although there were marked decreases in plasma potassium and magnesium. Sirolimus treatment reduced expression of NKCC2, and this was accompanied by greater urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, and magnesium. In sirolimus-treated animals, AQP2 expression was reduced. Expression of TRPM6 was increased, which might represent a direct stimulatory effect of sirolimus or a compensatory response. The finding that rosiglitazone prevented or attenuated all sirolimus-induced renal tubular defects has potential clinical implications.
A unique case of thioridazine-dependent discoloration of vision or "chromatopsia" is presented. This case merits its unique status because of the particular tint of the discoloration, the relative rapidity of onset of this symptoms, and the low dosage of thioridazine that was involved.
Mice deficient in the Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (Xpa) gene are defective in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and highly susceptible to skin carcinogenesis after dermal exposure to UV light or chemicals. Min (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mice, heterozygous for a germline nonsense mutation in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), develop intestinal tumors spontaneously and show additional intestinal tumors after exposure to the food mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). In this study, we investigated the impact of loss of XPA function on PhIP-induced intestinal tumorigenesis in F1 offspring of Min/+ (Apc(+/-)) mice crossed with Xpa gene-deficient mice. Apc(+/-) mice lacking both alleles of Xpa had higher susceptibility towards toxicity of PhIP, higher levels of PhIP-DNA adducts in the middle and distal small intestines, as well as in liver, and a higher number of small intestinal tumors at 11 weeks, compared with Apc(+/-) mice with one or two intact Xpa alleles. Localization of tumors was not affected, being highest in middle and distal small intestines in all genotypes. At 11 weeks of age, the number of spontaneous intestinal tumors was not significantly increased by homozygous loss of Xpa, but untreated Apc(+/-)/Xpa(-/-) mice had significantly shorter life-spans than their XPA-proficient littermates. Heterozygous loss of Xpa did not affect any of the measured end points. In conclusion, the Xpa gene and the NER pathway are involved in repair of bulky PhIP-DNA adducts in the intestines and the liver, and most probably of DNA lesions leading to spontaneous intestinal tumors. These results confirm a role of the NER pathway also in protection against cancer in internal organs, additional to its well-known importance in protection against skin cancer. An effect of Apc(+/-) on adduct levels, additional to that of Xpa(-/-), indicates that the truncated APC protein may affect a repair pathway other than NER.
Autopsies of 4 fetuses exposed to maternal cocaine are reported. Brain examination revealed hemorrhages in 3 of the fetuses involving the germinal matrix. The hemorrhages resembled subependymal germinal matrix hemorrhages seen as postnatal complications in premature infants with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. One of the placentas had sonographic evidence of abruption which could not be confirmed pathologically. The findings are discussed in light of reports of neurobehavioral deficits and other congenital anomalies in children and animals exposed to cocaine in utero. Speculations about the pathophysiologic events leading to these findings are made.
Evaluating the effect of apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs on human B lymphocytic leukemia cell lines (Nalm-6) and their cell cycle specificity.
Nalm-6 cells were treated with various anticancer drugs for 8-24 hours. Apoptotic cells and their cell cycle specificity were measured by using hypodiploid DNA-FCM and TdT assay + DNA staining.
ADR, VP16, CPT, MTX, Ara-C could markedly induce apoptosis of Nalm-6 cells in S phase. CPM, PRD, 6MP were less capable of inducing apoptosis. CPM in high dose resulted in cell necrosis. PRD induced apoptosis in G1 phase, while 6MP induced apoptosis in G1 and S phase. The effect of CPM showed no marked cell cycle specificity.
Hypodiploid DNA-FCM and TdT assay + DNA staining can be used to detect both tumor cell apoptosis and their cell cycle specificity which is helpful to predict prognosis and to design new chemotherapy regimen.
We have investigated levels of transcript homologous with glutathione S-transferase P (GST-P; GST 7-7) in tumours and hyperplastic lesions induced in the livers of rats by long-term gavage dosing with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and 6-p-dimethylaminophenylazobenzothiazole (6BT). Detailed histopathological examination of the livers of the 90 animals used in this study at 6-8 months after initiation of daily dosing revealed that, of the 30 animals treated with carcinogen, 15 had developed tumours or hyperplastic lesions. Of these, 11 were areas of fibrosarcoma/fibrous hyperplasia. The remaining four were hepatocellular carcinomas. Northern blotting of total RNA purified from these tissues revealed the presence of transcripts of 3 and 0.75 kb. Evidence is presented to indicate that the former is a hitherto-undetected precursor of the 3-kbp rat GST-P gene, the latter representing the previously characterized mature GST-P transcript. Large elevations of the 0.75-kb transcript (30-35-fold) were encountered in all of the hepatocellular carcinomas, but in none of the other lesions, indicating a highly significant correlation (P = less than 0.001) between high elevations in levels of GST-P mRNA and liver tumours of hepatocellular origin. Minor elevations in transcript level (less than or equal to 5-fold) were encountered in several of the non-hepatocellular lesions. In regenerating livers, small increases in the level of the 3-kb transcript (approximately 3-fold) were routinely detected in total RNA from all partial hepatectomies, a concomitant decrease of approximately similar magnitude occurring in the 0.75-kb transcript, suggesting that minor elevations in levels of GST-P transcript, where encountered in non-hepatocellular lesions, are related to pre-neoplasia rather than to the proliferative rate of hyperplastic cells per se. The data extend previous observations, carried out largely using short-term regimes, to an analysis of transcripts homologous with GST-P in hyperplastic, pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions induced by long-term dosing with genotoxic carcinogens, and strongly lend support to the concept that high (30-fold) elevations in GST-P transcript correlate most strikingly with tumours of hepatocellular origin.
A transformation assay using BALB/c 3T3 cells was conducted on 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX) to assess initiation and promotion activities of MX carcinogenesis. Statistically significant positive responses were obtained compared with the corresponding solvent controls in both the initiation assay post-treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and the promotion assay pretreated with 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA). Both TPA and MX inhibited metabolic cooperation in an assay using co-culture of V79 6-thioguanine (6-TG) sensitive and insensitive cells. However, cells isolated from transformed foci in the initiation assay did not induce any nodules after inoculation to BALB/c mice, the strain of mouse from which the transformation assay cells were derived. Although the study was carried out for 2-3 weeks, this might have been too short to develop nodules under the conditions of this experiment. This in vitro cell transformation study with MX adds supportive information to studies showing MX carcinogenicity and tumour promoter activity, and adds mechanistic understanding of the action of MX.
To determine the strength of oral anticoagulation therapy in atrial fibrillation that provides the best balance between the prevention of thromboembolism and the occurrence of bleeding complications.
We studied 435 patients with atrial fibrillation who were hospitalized from 2000 to 2002 and given warfarin for prevention of thromboembolism. INR-specified rates for both ischemic and major hemorrhagic events were analyzed and the optimal levels of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation patients determined.
The average dose of warfarin was (2.77 +/- 0.83) mg and the median duration of anticoagulation is 7 months (from 1 month to 3 years). In total, there were 31 confirmed bleeding events, with major hemorrhage occurring in 5 patients. Age of the patients in the hemorrhage group is not significantly higher than that in control group (65.09 +/- 9.99 vs 62.01 +/- 12.19, P = 0.259). Chronic heart failure or hypertension increased the risk of bleeding during warfarin therapy. Multivariate analysis showed that INR >or= 3.0 is an independent risk factor for hemorrhage (OR = 3.7435, 95% CI 1.2819 - 8.9838). The risk of stroke or thromboembolism rose steeply with INR below 1.5.
To achieve optimal levels of anticoagulation with the lowest risk in patients with atrial fibrillation, values of INR below 1.5 and above 3.0 should be avoided.
The effects of clozapine administration on smoking were examined in chronic schizophrenic outpatients.
Twenty-nine of 30 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a university-affiliated Community Mental Health Center clozapine clinic were retrospectively surveyed by semistructured questionnaire regarding smoking before and after clozapine administration.
Smokers comprised 62% (N = 18) of patients, and within this group, there was a significant decrease in reported daily cigarette use during clozapine treatment compared with level of use when patients had been treated with typical neuroleptics (1.67 +/- 1.13 vs. 1.26 +/- 0.72 packs/day, p = .025).
Clozapine may alter smoking behaviors in chronic schizophrenics.
We report two cases of vasospastic angina associated with anaphylactic reaction caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Both patients exhibited anaphylactic manifestations, such as general rash and urticaria, along with angina pectoris with electrocardiographic ST-segment elevations after suppository administration of diclofenac sodium or indomethacin, the most commonly used NSAIDs. Although these patients had normal coronary arteriograms, intracoronary administration of ergonovine or acetylcholine provoked diffuse coronary artery spasms accompanied by chest pain and ischemic ST-segment changes. It is therefore suggested that an allergic mechanism may be involved as a causative factor of the coronary artery spasm induced by NSAIDs.
Tretinoin is effective in acute promyelocytic leukaemia in adults. Data about its efficacy and safety in children are limited. We have treated 9 children with tretinoin at 45 mg/m2 per day. Pseudotumour cerebri or hyperleucocytosis occurred in 5 patients. Retinoic acid syndrome was seen in 3 cases. 1 of 2 children who developed hyperleucocytosis, pseudotumour cerebri, and retinoic acid syndrome died despite steroids and mechanical ventilation. Complete remissions with tretinoin alone were achieved in 15 patients. All 8 surviving children received consolidation chemotherapy. Our experience with tretinoin therapy suggests that toxicity is frequent in children.
The MS4A2 gene, the beta chain of the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin (Ig)E, has previously been linked to atopy and asthma. The beta-chain of FcepsilonR1 enhances receptor maturation and signal transduction capacity, leading to the release of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines that can exacerbate the symptom of asthma. This study was performed to evaluate whether two genetic polymorphisms of the FcepsilonR1beta gene (FcepsilonR1beta-109T > C and FcepsilonR1beta E237G) are associated with aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). The MS4A2 gene polymorphisms (FcepsilonR1beta-109T > C and FcepsilonR1beta E237G) were determined by SNP-IT assays in patients with AIA (N = 164), aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA, N = 144) and normal controls (NC, N = 264) recruited from a Korean population.
The genotype frequencies of FcepsilonR1beta-109T > C and E237G polymorphisms were not significantly associated with the pathogenesis of AIA. However, FcepsilonR1beta-109T > C polymorphism was significantly associated with the presence of specific IgE to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB); the number of subjects carrying both homozygous TT genotype of FcepsilonR1beta-109T > C and specific IgE to SEB was significantly higher in the AIA group when compared with the other control groups (P = 0.01, odds ratio (OR) = 7.723, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.327-39.860 for AIA vs. ATA; P = 0.02, OR = 6.364, 95% CI = 1.149 approximately 35.229 for AIA vs. NC). In addition, luciferase reporter assays also showed that the FcepsilonR1beta-109T allele was associated with higher promoter activity of MS4A2 in both RBL-2H3 and A549 cell lines.
FcepsilonR1beta-109T > C polymorphism may increase expression of MS4A2 by mast cells, leading to enhanced release of proinflammatory mediators in the asthmatic airway, contributing to increased susceptibility to AIA.
The effects of microinjection of clonidine (1-10 micrograms in 1 microliter) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in urethane-anesthetized rats. Intramedullary administration of clonidine, but not saline vehicle, caused a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. The clonidine-induced hypotension was antagonized by prior spinal transection, but not bilateral vagotomy. On the other hand, the clonidine-induced bradycardia was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy, but not spinal transection. Furthermore, selective destruction of the spinal 5-HT nerves, produced by bilateral spinal injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the bradycardiac responses to clonidine microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats. The data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia. The induced hypotension is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity, whereas the induced bradycardia was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in a number of solid malignancies, including colorectal cancer. Herein, we report the first case of 5-FU-induced psychosis. Psychosis occurred after the first 2 cycles of 5-FU, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, plus bevacizumab and recurred upon rechallenge with further 5-FU and leucovorin.
