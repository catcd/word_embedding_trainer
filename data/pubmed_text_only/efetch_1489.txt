We report a case of prolonged coma (7 days) which arose as a complication of the treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures and delirium with intravenous phenobarbital and diazepam. In an attempt to enhance the elimination of diazepam and its active metabolites, as well as phenobarbital, 40 grams activated charcoal was given every 4 hours (6 doses). Coma was completely reversed within 12 hours; serum half life (t1/2) of diazepam was reduced from 195 to 18 hours during charcoal administration. We postulate that higher free (unbound) diazepam concentrations secondary to hypoalbuminemia, occurring as a result of liver disease, may have increased the depth of our patient's coma, but paradoxically, by making more drug available for diffusion across the gastrointestinal membrane barrier, may have enhanced the ability of activated charcoal to adsorb diazepam and, therefore, decrease its t1/2.
Data are presented on our 5-year experience with combination chemotherapy of stage II-IV Hodgkin's disease (110), the unfavorable prognosis group, using a novel regimen of chemotherapy--CEA/ABVD (belustin, etoposide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Complete remission after 4 courses of CEA/ABVD chemotherapy was reported in 31.8%, unconfirmed complete remission--45.5%, objective effect--100% and an 80% regression of tumor mass--93.2%. No chemo-resistant forms were identified. Five-year actuarial relapse-free survival was 96.4%; overall 5-year survival--97.7%. Death from complications recorded during medication period occurred in 2.3% (1 out of 44), recurrence--2.3% (1 out of 44). Recurrence-free survival rose by 25% (p < 0.05) while overall survival--by 20% (p = 0.04 in year 3), as compared with COOP(MOPP)/ABVD (179 patients with poor prognosis). Our regimen opens up new vistas in managing Hodgkin's disease.
Repeated administration of amphetamine or methamphetamine (MA) results in an augmentation of its locomotor-activating effects, which is a phenomenon known as behavioral sensitization. In humans, chronic use of the drug elicits a progressive augmentation in paranoid symptoms that closely resemble schizophrenia. Behavioral sensitization has some common properties with other forms of neural plasticity such as kindling, learning and long-term potentiation (LTP). The author examined in the present study whether behavioral sensitization could be blocked by GABA-benzodiazepine agonists, known to inhibit kindling, learning as well as LTP. Rats (Male Wistar-King rats) treated with MA (1 mg/kg, s.c.) for 10 days displayed significantly enhanced motor activity when tested with MA (1 mg/kg) after a 7-8 day withdrawal period indicating the acquisition of behavioral sensitization. Treatment with clonazepam (CZP) (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg), a GABA-benzodiazepine agonist, prior to MA administration prevented the acquisition of sensitization. In contrast, treatment with flumazenil (Flu) (10 mg/kg), a GABA-benzodiazepine antagonist, prior to MA administration did not affect the acquisition of sensitization. And treatment with Flu prior to CZP administration suppressed the inhibitory effect of CZP. CZP had no effect on the expression of sensitization in the sensitized rats, when given prior to the MA readministration. These results suggest that stimulation of GABA-benzodiazepine receptors plays a role in the acquisition but not in the expression of behavioral sensitization.
Evidence suggests that increased ambient air pollution concentrations are associated with health effects, although relatively few studies have specifically examined infants.
We examined associations of daily ambient air pollution concentrations with central apnea (prolonged pauses in breathing) and bradycardia (low heart rate) events among infants prescribed home cardiorespiratory monitors.
The home monitors record the electrocardiogram, heart rate, and respiratory effort for detected apnea and bradycardia events in high-risk infants [primarily premature and low birth weight (LBW) infants]. From August 1998 through December 2002, 4,277 infants had 8,960 apnea event-days and 29,450 bradycardia event-days in > 179,000 days of follow-up. We assessed the occurrence of apnea and bradycardia events in relation to speciated particulate matter and gaseous air pollution levels using a 2-day average of air pollution (same day and previous day), adjusting for temporal trends, temperature, and infant age.
We observed associations between bradycardia and 8-hr maximum ozone [odds ratio (OR) = 1.049 per 25-ppb increase; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.021-1.078] and 1-hr maximum nitrogen dioxide (OR =1.025 per 20-ppb increase; 95% CI, 1.000-1.050). The association with ozone was robust to different methods of control for time trend and specified correlation structure. In secondary analyses, associations of apnea and bradycardia with pollution were generally stronger in infants who were full term and of normal birth weight than in infants who were both premature and LBW.
These results suggest that higher air pollution concentrations may increase the occurrence of apnea and bradycardia in high-risk infants.
Anaemia during peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy is common in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV)-coinfected patients despite the use of lower doses of RBV than are recommended for HIV-seronegative persons. In addition, concurrent zidovudine (ZDV) may exacerbate the anaemia caused by PEG-IFN and RBV. We retrospectively analysed the incidence of anaemia, RBV dose reduction and epoetin-alpha (EPO) use among coinfected patients treated with PEG-IFN and weight-based RBV (800-1400 mg/day) who enrolled in two clinical trials and had haemoglobin (Hb) levels assessed at baseline and after 4 and/or 12 weeks of HCV treatment. Overall, 217 patients were included; pre-treatment Hb levels (mean 14.7 g/dL) were similar in all patients, including ZDV users (29% of patients). After 4 weeks of therapy, the mean Hb decline was greater among ZDV recipients (3.13 g/dL) compared with those on other anti-retroviral treatment (ART) (2.13 g/dL) or on no ART (1.47 g/dL) (P < 0.0001). RBV dose reduction and EPO use were more common in patients taking ZDV compared with those not taking ZDV (P < 0.0001). RBV dose was not associated with Hb reduction, RBV dose reduction or EPO use. Virologic response after 12 weeks of therapy and the treatment discontinuation rate did not differ by ZDV use. The use of ZDV but not weight-based RBV dosing was associated with an increased risk of anaemia, RBV dose reduction or EPO use in coinfected patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV. However, ZDV use was not associated with higher rates of treatment discontinuation or lower early virologic response rates. HIV and hepatitis C care providers should be cognizant of these data.
There is limited evidence suggesting that prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants may increase the risk of stillbirth, but previous epidemiological studies have not elaborated the most susceptible gestational period for the effects of air pollution exposure on stillbirth.
We estimated associations between exposure to ambient air pollutants and stillbirth, with special reference to the assessment of gestational periods when the fetus is most susceptible.
We conducted a population-based case-control study in Taiwan. The case group consisted of 9,325 stillbirths, and the control group included 93,250 births randomly selected from 1,510,064 Taiwanese singleton newborns in 2001-2007. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) per 10-ppb change for ozone and nitrogen dioxide, 1-ppb change for sulfur dioxide (SO2), 10-μg/m3 change for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), and 100-ppb change for carbon monoxide during different gestational periods and according to term or preterm (< 37 weeks) birth status.
Stillbirth increased in association with a 1-ppb increase in first-trimester SO2 [adjusted OR = 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.04], particularly among preterm births (adjusted OR = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07). Stillbirth was also associated with a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 during the first (adjusted OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05) and second (adjusted OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04) month of gestation, and, as with SO2, associations appeared to be restricted to preterm births (first-trimester adjusted OR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07).
The study provides evidence that exposure to outdoor air SO2 and PM10 may increase the risk of stillbirth, especially among preterm births, and that the most susceptible time periods for exposure are during the first trimester of gestation.
Experimental pancreatitis was induced by cooling the splenetic part of rat pancreas with chlorethyl, and the cells of duodenal area of the pancreas were studied at different stages of pancreatitis using cytomorphometry, cytomorphology and autoradiography. Interlobular and interacinar oedemas were observed at the first hours after treatment. In 24 hours the intracellular oedema of exocrine pancreatic cells (EP) was detected. On day 14 after treatment typical acute edematous pancreatitis developed. The observed changes involve a pathological activation of EP of the duodenal area, a subsequent restoration of the structure of this area, and later a passage of pancreatitis into the chronic form. The usefulness of this model of pancreatitis for quantitative cytochemical studies of EP during pathogenesis and drug treatment is discussed.
A total of 453 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were followed up for 35.2 +/- 27.9 months (range 3-106). The clinical parameters decreased significantly after 6 months. Twenty-eight patients were in remission (6.4%). Rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity was less common in the group of patients in remission, with a higher frequency of visits and methotrexate (MTX) onset after 65 yr. There was a significant degradation of radiographic lesions (n = 60). A total of 101 patients (23.1%) stopped MTX, for toxicity (n = 61) and failure (n = 20). The onset of MTX after 65 yr, a low number of visits and the occurrence of side-effects were predictive of MTX withdrawal. A total of 259 patients (59.3%) had side-effects. A Ritchie's index < or = 10, a lower polymorphonuclear cell count and the absence of RF were predictive of side-effects. The probability of being on MTX at 5 yr was 73%. This study confirms the high efficacy of MTX in RA.
Topical capsaicin augments gastric mucosal blood flow and is cytoprotective. This phenomenon is blocked by nitric oxide (NO) synthase and cyclooxygenase inhibition. Capsaicin-sensitive neurons store and release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The purpose of this investigation was to study the effects of a CGRP antagonist on capsaicin-induced hyperemia and protection and to determine the role of NO and the cytoprotective prostaglandin PGE2 in this process.
The glandular stomachs in male Sprague-Dawley rats (280 to 350 gm) were chambered with the blood supply intact. Animals were divided into four groups. Normal saline solution (group 1) or the CGRP antagonists hCGRP8-37 (groups 2 through 4, 0.047 mg/ml) were continuously infused intraarterially via a retrograde splenic artery catheter at a rate of 0.034 ml/min after rats were given an intravenous bolus of either NSS (groups 1 and 2), L-arginine (group 3), or D-arginine (group 4) (200 mg/kg). The gastric mucosa was then topically exposed to normal saline solution (pH 7.4), followed by 160 mumol/L capsaicin and then 100 mmol/L acidified taurocholate (pH 1.2), each for 15 minutes. Gastric mucosal blood flow (ml/min/100 gm tissue) was continuously measured (laser Doppler) and mucosal injury was assessed. Luminal PGE2 production was measured during the bile acid injury period by radioimmunoassay.
The CGRP antagonist hCGRP8-37 significantly inhibits capsaicin-induced hyperemia and its associated mucosal cytoprotection and also significantly decreases luminal mucosal PGE2 production. Pretreatment with L-arginine, but not D-arginine, reverses these effects of CGRP antagonism.
CGRP is a mediator of capsaicin-induced hyperemia and protection. This effect may be dependent on both NO and PGE2 production.
To assess the reasons for and timing of discontinuation of antimalarial drugs, principally hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
A lupus database was reviewed to identify antimalarial use from inception to April 1996. Reasons for drug discontinuation were assessed by medical record review.
Of 224 patients with SLE, 156 (70%) had received antimalarials. The 156 users received 203 courses of antimalarials, of which 197 (97%) were for HCQ. The average duration of use was 6.9 years/patient. Antimalarials were discontinued at least once in 62 patients. When only the first course of use was considered, 67, 50, and 38% of patients continued to receive antimalarials at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively (for all courses, the rates were 82, 66, and 52%, respectively). Reasons for discontinuation were disease remission in 26 (42%), side effects in 18 (29%), noncompliance in 9 (15%), lack of efficacy in 5 (8%), and miscellaneous causes such as pregnancy/surgery in 4 (6%). When all courses were considered, 20 subjects were withdrawn for side effects, including gastrointestinal in 11; headache and dizziness, and nonretinal eye problem in 2 each; and hearing loss and rash in one each. Two developed HCQ myopathy (1.9 cases/1000 patient-years of HCQ therapy; 95% CI 0.2, 7.0). One developed HCQ retinopathy after 6 years at a dose of 6.5 mg/kg/day (0.95 cases/1000 patient-years of HCQ; 95% CI 0.0, 5.5). Among patients who had received HCQ for at least 6 years, 1.3% developed retinopathy (95% CI 0.03, 7.0%).
HCQ is well tolerated in SLE. However, ophthalmologic testing remains essential, as retinopathy does occur, albeit rarely.
Interleukin-6 modulates immune response, estrogen production, and growth pathways in breast cancer. We evaluated the effect of several common, functional interleukin-6 promoter variants in node-positive breast cancer patients enrolled on a multicenter, cooperative group, adjuvant chemotherapy trial to determine whether these variants were associated with clinical outcome overall and by estrogen receptor tumor phenotype. Genomic DNA and clinical data were collected from a clinical trial of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by randomization to high-dose cyclophosphamide/thiotepa or observation (Intergroup Trial 0121). Genotyping for -174G>C (rs1800795), -597G>A (rs1800797), and -572G>C (rs1800796) was done by site-specific PCR and PyroSequencing, whereas the -373A(n)T(n) repeat was directly sequenced. Log-rank tests and Cox modeling were used to compare outcomes by genotype/haplotype and other factors. Three hundred forty-six patients (64% of trial) had corresponding genotype/clinical data available and did not differ from overall trial participants. After adjustment, patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors and genotypes 597 GG or 174 GG had significantly worse disease-free survival [hazard ratio (HR), 1.6; P = 0.02 and HR, 1.71; P = 0.007, respectively], whereas the 373 8A12T repeat appeared to be protective (HR, 0.62; P = 0.02). The presence of at least one copy of the haplotype ([-597G, -572G, -373[10A/11T], -174G]) was associated with worse disease-free survival (HR, 1.46; P = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier plots show that all patients in this group relapsed by 24 months from diagnosis. This poor-risk haplotype was quite common overall (estimated frequency, 0.20) and twice as frequent among Blacks (estimated frequency, 0.41).
We have used a gene expression array-based strategy to identify the methylation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), a potential tumor suppressor gene, as a frequent event in human colorectal cancers (CRC). TFPI2 belongs to the recently described group of embryonic cell Polycomb group (PcG)-marked genes that may be predisposed to aberrant DNA methylation in early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. Aberrant methylation of TFPI2 was detected in almost all CRC adenomas (97%, n = 56) and stages I to IV CRCs (99%, n = 115). We further explored the potential of TFPI2 as a biomarker for the early detection of CRC using stool DNA-based assays in patients with nonmetastatic CRC and average-risk noncancer controls who were candidates for screening. TFPI2 methylation was detected in stool DNA from stage I to III CRC patients with a sensitivity of 76% to 89% and a specificity of 79% to 93%. Detection of TFPI2 methylation in stool DNA may act as a useful adjunct to the noninvasive strategies for screening of CRCs in the future.
Hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcys) enhances ceramide production, leading to the activation of NADPH oxidase and consequent glomerular oxidative stress and sclerosis. The present study was performed to determine whether acid sphingomyelinase (Asm), a ceramide-producing enzyme, is implicated in the development of hHcys-induced glomerular oxidative stress and injury. Uninephrectomized Asm-knockout (Asm(-/-)) and wild-type (Asm(+/+)) mice, with or without Asm short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transfection, were fed a folate-free (FF) diet for 8 weeks, which significantly elevated the plasma Hcys level compared with mice fed normal chow. By using in vivo molecular imaging, we found that transfected shRNAs were expressed in the renal cortex starting on day 3 and continued for 24 days. The FF diet significantly increased renal ceramide production, Asm mRNA and activity, urinary total protein and albumin excretion, glomerular damage index, and NADPH-dependent superoxide production in the renal cortex from Asm(+/+) mice compared with that from Asm(-/-) or Asm shRNA-transfected wild-type mice. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the FF diet decreased the expression of podocin but increased desmin and ceramide levels in glomeruli from Asm(+/+) mice but not in those from Asm(-/-) and Asm shRNA-transfected wild-type mice. In conclusion, our observations reveal that Asm plays a pivotal role in mediating podocyte injury and glomerular sclerosis associated with NADPH oxidase-associated local oxidative stress during hHcys.
Pleural pericarditis, fever, and a positive reaction for antinuclear antibody developed in a 50-year-old white woman while she was receiving methyldopa (500 mg daily). After withdrawal of the drug, there was complete resolution of the clinical signs and symptoms, as well as normalization of the patient's antinuclear antibody titer. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a clinical lupus-like syndrome induced by therapy with methyldopa.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway in corticostriatal long-term depression induction in a model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in experimental parkinsonism. Moreover, we have also analysed the possibility of targeting striatal phosphodiesterases to reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesia. To study synaptic plasticity in sham-operated rats and in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned animals chronically treated with therapeutic doses of levodopa, recordings from striatal spiny neurons were taken using either intracellular recordings with sharp electrodes or whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Behavioural analysis of levodopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements was performed before and after the treatment with two different inhibitors of phosphodiesterases, zaprinast and UK-343664. Levodopa-induced dyskinesia was associated with the loss of long-term depression expression at glutamatergic striatal synapses onto spiny neurons. Both zaprinast and UK-343664 were able to rescue the induction of this form of synaptic plasticity via a mechanism requiring the modulation of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels. This effect on synaptic plasticity was paralleled by a significant reduction of abnormal movements following intrastriatal injection of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Our findings suggest that drugs selectively targeting phosphodiesterases can ameliorate levodopa-induced dyskinesia, possibly by restoring physiological synaptic plasticity in the striatum. Future studies exploring the possible therapeutic effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in non-human primate models of Parkinson's disease and the involvement of striatal synaptic plasticity in these effects remain necessary to validate this hypothesis.
Common and rare variants associated with body mass index (BMI) and obesity account for <5% of the variance in BMI. We performed SNP and copy number variation (CNV) association analyses in 1,509 children with obesity at the extreme tail (>3 s.d. from the mean) of the BMI distribution and 5,380 controls. Evaluation of 29 SNPs (P < 1 × 10(-5)) in an additional 971 severely obese children and 1,990 controls identified 4 new loci associated with severe obesity (LEPR, PRKCH, PACS1 and RMST). A previously reported 43-kb deletion at the NEGR1 locus was significantly associated with severe obesity (P = 6.6 × 10(-7)). However, this signal was entirely driven by a flanking 8-kb deletion; absence of this deletion increased risk for obesity (P = 6.1 × 10(-11)). We found a significant burden of rare, single CNVs in severely obese cases (P < 0.0001). Integrative gene network pathway analysis of rare deletions indicated enrichment of genes affecting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the neuronal regulation of energy homeostasis.
To elevate chemo-resistance of human cancer cells is a major obstacle in the treatment and management of malignant cancers. Diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS) are presented in the Alliaceae family particularly in garlic. Although DAS, DADS and DATS have been shown to exhibit anticancer activities, there is little information on effects of these compounds on drug resistant genes in human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we are the first to show that DAS, DADS and DATS at 25 μM for 24-h and 48-h incubations promoted expression of drug resistant genes in colo 205 human colon cancer cells. In vitro experiments indicated that DATS promoted gene expression of multidrug resistant 1 (Mdr1) (p<0.05), and DAS and DADS promoted MRP3 gene expression and DATS alone stimulated gene expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1) (p<0.05) in colo 205 cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that DADS and DATS induced Mdr1 and MRP1 gene expression (p<0.05). DADS promoted MRP3 gene expression (p<0.05) as well as DADS and DATS increased MRP4 and MRP6 gene expression (p<0.05) in the colo 205 xenograft mice. Based on our in vitro and in vivo results, diallyl polysulfides (DAS, DADS and DATS) affected the gene expression of the multidrug resistance in colo 205 human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
Responses of the liver to chronic injury include inflammation, regeneration and fibrosis, which finally lead to cirrhosis. The cause of liver cirrhosis appears to be impaired proliferative capability of hepatocytes caused by continuous hepatic damage, and subsequent accumulation of extracellular matrix produced by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) play a crucial role in hepatocyte proliferation and hepatofibrogenesis, respectively. However, sequential analyses of the intrahepatic expression of EGF and TGF-beta1 in the course of cirrhosis development have not been examined fully. In the present study, liver cirrhosis was produced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), and intrahepatic mRNA expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), EGF and TGF-beta1 were quantitatively estimated by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. Histological and semiquantitative densitometric examination of liver sections revealed that the accumulation of extracellular matrix components was increased according to the period of DMN treatment. Histological examination of liver sections of rats treated with DMN for 4 and 6 weeks revealed pre-cirrhosis and cirrhosis, respectively. Intrahepatic mRNA expression levels of PCNA and EGF correlated well. Expression levels of both molecules were increased significantly during the course of cirrhosis development, but decreased significantly at the time of complete cirrhosis manifestation. In contrast, intrahepatic TGF-beta1 expression was increased significantly according to the period of DMN treatment, and reached a peak at the time of cirrhosis manifestation. These results suggest that proliferative capability of hepatocytes was impaired by continuous liver damage due, in part, to the decrease of a hepatocyte mitogen EGF, and that increased intrahepatic TGF-beta1 activated HSCs to retrieve space lost by hepatocyte destruction, resulting in complete cirrhosis manifestation.
The aims of the study were to characterize the rate and extent of the rebound effect after abrupt cessation of a chronic exposure of l-propranolol in spontaneous hypertensive rats, using exercise-induced tachycardia as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. Thirty-two spontaneous hypertensive rats were randomized to receive either placebo or 4 or 8 mg/kg/day s.c. infusion of l-propranolol for 11 days using osmotic minipumps. The heart rate was measured after standardized physical exercise before and during drug exposure and over 12 days after cessation, using a computerized tail-cuff method. Blood samples were collected after each effect measurement during the infusion. A similar reduction in exercise tachycardia was registered for the two doses. No apparent tolerance development was found, but both doses showed a clear rebound effect of similar extent and intensity. The maximal rebound effect was observed on the second day after cessation and was found to have a duration of about 6 days. A mechanism-based model was developed to describe the rate and extent of changes in beta-adrenoceptor up- and down-regulation with increased sensitivity of the transducer complex. The half-life of disappearance of up-regulated beta-adrenoceptors was estimated to be 2.0 days (1.0-3.9 days). The effect-versus-time data was analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effect modeling with the program NONMEM. A dose-dependent reduction in the growth of body weight was observed during drug treatment, which was reversible. A dose- and time-dependent increase in the alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein concentration was also observed.
There is much interest in the possible ameliorating effects of estrogen on various autoimmune diseases. We previously established the protective effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In the current study we investigated the effectiveness of oral treatment with ethinyl estradiol (EE) on EAE and the mechanisms involved. Ethinyl estradiol is a semisynthetic estrogen compound found in birth control pills, and its chemical structure allows this compound to retain activity when given orally. We found that oral EE, like E2, drastically suppressed EAE induced by proteolipid protein 139-151 peptide when given at initiation of EAE. However, unlike E2, EE reduced clinical severity when given after the onset of clinical signs. Treatment with EE significantly decreased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-6) by activated T cells as well as the expression of a key matrix metalloproteinase, disease-mediating chemokines/receptors, and IgG2a levels, but increased the expression of TGF-beta 3 in the CNS. The absence of infiltrating lymphocytes together with the suppression of cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase, and chemokines/receptors suggests that EE, like E2, protects mice from EAE by inhibiting the recruitment of T cells and macrophages into the CNS. These results suggest that oral ethinyl estradiol might be a successful candidate as therapy for multiple sclerosis.
This study aimed to describe the performance of a cochlear implant in a patient with profound hearing loss with the A1555G mitochondrial mutation.
The study was conducted at two university hospitals.
A 50-year-old Japanese man in whom bilateral profound hearing loss developed after administration of streptomycin at the age of 23 participated. The pedigree of the family showed exclusively maternal transmission of hearing impairment.
Genetic study and auditory rehabilitation with a cochlear implant were performed.
The A1555G point mutation was identified from the patient's mitochondrial DNA. Since activation of the implant, the patient has been using it successfully with a monosyllable recognition score of 78% using Japanese word lists for speech audiometry.
The current case indicated that cochlear implantation may be a valuable choice of therapy for the patient with profound hearing loss with the A1555G mutation. The excellent auditory performance with a cochlear implant suggests that hearing loss associated with this mutation is primarily caused by insult to the cochlear tissue containing rich mitochondria (i.e., hair cells or stria vascularis or both), not to the cochlear nerve and its central connections.
A 62-year-old man developed asymptomatic anicteric hepatitis during cimetidine therapy for duodenal ulcer disease. Liver biopsy revealed zonal (centrolobular) necrosis, bile stasis, and mononuclear cell infiltration. Electron microscopy featured mitochondrial hyperplasia, giant mitochondria, and liver cell bile inclusions. The diagnosis of cimetidine-related hepatitis was confirmed by re-exposure to cimetidine, which prompted a rapid rise in serum transaminases while under observation in the hospital. Cimetidine hepatitis is rarely reported, and routine monitoring of the patient's liver tests during therapy does not seem cost-effective as a general practice.
