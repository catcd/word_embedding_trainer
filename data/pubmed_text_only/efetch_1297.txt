We have compared the incidence of bradycardia in two groups of patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Twenty consecutive patients were allocated randomly to receive either vecuronium (n = 8) or alcuronium (n = 12) as part of a standard anaesthetic technique. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate less than 50 beat min-1. Five episodes of bradycardia occurred with vecuronium and none with alcuronium (P less than 0.01).
The authors conducted a population-based case-control study of 1,068 incident leukemia cases and 5,039 controls aged 20-74 years during 1994-1997 to examine the association between exposure to drinking water chlorination disinfection by-products and adult leukemia risk in Canada. Residence and drinking water source histories and data from municipal water supplies were used to estimate individual chlorination disinfection by-product exposure according to water source, chlorination status, and chlorination disinfection by-product levels during the 40-year period before the interview. The analysis included 686 cases and 3,420 controls for whom water quality information was available for at least 30 of these years. Increased risk of chronic myeloid leukemia was associated with increasing years of exposure to different chlorination disinfection by-product indexes, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.72 (95% confidence interval: 1.01, 3.08) for the highest exposure duration to total trihalomethanes of more than 40 microg/liter. In contrast, the risk of the other studied leukemia subtypes was found to decrease with increasing years of exposure to chlorination disinfection by-products. A protective effect was noted for chronic lymphoid leukemia (odds ratio = 0.60, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.41, 0.87) associated with the highest exposure duration to total trihalomethanes of more than 40 microg/liter. More studies with long-term exposure measures and large enough to evaluate leukemia subtypes are needed to further understanding of the issue.
We found in a representative sample of 392 first hospital admissions for schizophrenia a higher mean age at onset in females by 3.2 to 3.9 years, whereas the lifetime risk was equal for both sexes. In males the rates of onset show a steep increase reaching the maximum value in the age group 15-24 years, followed then by a steady decrease. Females reach the first peak with a clear delay between 20 and 29 years. After the decrease a second smaller peak is observed consistently in females within the age group 45-49 years and over. After having excluded alternative explanations for this gender differences (for example, diagnosis artefacts, sociocultural factors), we hypothesized that the effect of oestradiol on the dopaminergic system enhances the vulnerability threshold for schizophrenia, which is lowered again during the menopause. Alternatively we assumed that testosterone reduces the vulnerability threshold and thus furthers the earlier onset of schizophrenia in males. We tested these hypotheses in animal models by investigating the effects of the gonadal hormones on haloperidol-induced catalepsy and on apomorphine-induced stereotypies in both neonatal and adult rats. Testosterone showed no clear influence on the tested dopamine-mediated behaviour. Oestradiol caused a significant reduction on both dopamine-agonist and dopamine-antagonist induced behaviour. These effects were stronger in neonatal animals. Since oestradiol caused a 2.8-fold reduction of dopamine receptor affinity for sulpiride, we assumed that the behavioural changes caused by oestradiol were accounted for by a down-regulation of the dopaminergic system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathy in rats was monitored by measuring the motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and histopathology of the tibial nerve. Pretreatment with lisinopril (2 mg/kg p.o., 5 days prior to STZ and continued for 10 weeks) significantly (p < 0.01) prevented deterioration of MNCV as compared to STZ-diabetic animals. Nerve sections from the lisinopril pretreated group revealed less structural damage as compared to STZ-diabetic rats. However lisinopril had no effect on blood sugar, i.e., it did not alter the diabetic state. It is concluded that lisinopril prevents the development of experimental diabetic neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats.
An increased risk of obesity has become a common public health concern as it is associated with hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, heart diseases, liver steatosis etc. Pharmacological intervention with natural product-based drugs is considered a healthier alternative to treat obesity. This study was aimed to evaluate anti-obesity effects of piperine on high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in rats. Piperine was isolated from methanolic extract of Piper nigrum by using column chromatography and confirmed by LC-MS analysis. Male SD rats were fed HFD initially for 15weeks to induce obesity. After induction of obesity, piperine was supplemented in different doses (20, 30 and 40mg/kgb.wt) through HFD for 42days to experimental rats. HFD induced changes in body weight, body composition, fat percentage, adiposity index, blood pressure, plasma levels of glucose, insulin resistance, leptin, adiponectin, plasma and tissue lipid profiles, liver antioxidants were explained. The activities of lipase, amylase and lipid metabolic marker enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were assessed in experimental rats. Supplementation of piperine at a dose of 40mg/kgb.wt has significantly (p<0.05) reversed the HFD-induced alterations in experimental rats in a dose dependant manner, the maximum therapeutic effect being noted at a dose of 40mg/kgb.wt. Our study concludes that piperine can be well considered as an effective bioactive molecule to suppress of body weight, improve insulin and leptin sensitivity, ultimately leading to regulate obesity.
Ifosfamide was given in i.v. doses of 600 to 1200 mg/sq m/day for 5 days to 32 cancer patients, refractory to prior therapy, in an attempt to investigate the possibility of reducing toxicity by dose fractionation. Microscopic hematuria occurred in 14% and gross hematuria in only 10% of the patient trials. Azotemia did not occur in any patient on this study. Reversible myelosuppression was comparable to that found by other investigators. Other side effects such as nausea and mental confusion occurred infrequently. Ifosfamide produced antitumor effect in 7 of 27 evaluable patients. This study indicates that the renal and bladder toxicity of ifosfamide can be substantially reduced if the drug is administered in i.v. infusions of 1 to 2 hr daily for 5 days.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a paralytic disorder characterized by degeneration of large motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord. A subset of ALS is inherited (familial ALS, FALS) and is associated with more than 70 different mutations in the SOD1 gene. Here we report that lymphoblast cell lines derived from FALS patients with 16 different mutations in SOD1 gene exhibit significant increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with sporadic ALS (SALS) and normal controls (spouses of ALS patients). The ROS generation did not correlate with SOD1 activity. Further, cells incubated with vitamin C, catalase or the flavinoid quercetin significantly reduced ROS in all groups. The catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole resulted in a ten-fold increase of ROS in all groups. Neither L-nitroarginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor or vitamin E altered the ROS levels. Thus, these studies suggest that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a major ROS elevated in FALS lymphoblasts and it may contribute to the degeneration of susceptible cells. Further, we postulate a mechanism by which increased H(2)O(2) could be generated by mutant SOD1.
A cardiomyopathy similar to that observed in cancer patients after prolonged chemotherapy with adriamycin can be produced in the rabbit, characterized by mitochondrial and myofilamentous degeneration with noninflammatory myolysis and connective tissue repair. The progressive and delayed myocardial lesions produced in rabbits receiving increasing total doses of adriamycin were studied after 23, 35, 43, and 77 days of continuous treatment and in posttreatment periods up to 150 to 180 days after the last administration of adriamycin. Total adriamycin doses that produced increased serum enzyme, myocardial sodium, and calcium levels but that failed to elicit serious myocardial morphological lesions during the period of drug administration resulted in a delayed cardiomyopathy leaving focal areas of fibrosis and progressive lesions that became more severe after discontinuation of drug administration. These findings suggest that the myocardial effects of adriamycin are cumulative and potentially nonreversible.
The authors evaluated the history of treatment in a population of patients awaiting gastric bypass surgery.
A standard questionnaire was used to evaluate the history of different therapeutic methods for weight loss in 312 patients between 13 and 70 years of age: 247 (79.2%) women and 66 (20.8%) men.
BMI varied between 33.0 to 100.0 kg/m2. The most common therapeutic method for losing weight was the use of formulae containing amphetamines, n=270 (86.5%). Only a tendency could be found towards a difference between women and men regarding amphetamine utilization respectively: 218 (88.3%) vs 52 (80.0%); P=0.066. Patients used formulae for the first time at an average age of 22.5+/-8.0 years old (from 8 to 57 years old). 43.7% (n=118) of the patients who used amphetamines have never received any information about the drug, and 80.6% (n=216) regret using this option. Dry mouth was the most common side-effect reported, n=205 (81%). Women had more frequent reports of depression and tremors than men, 58.6% vs 40.0% (P=0.017) and 44% vs 25% (P=0.011) respectively.
Amphetamines were used on a large scale in this population and a high level of side-effects were observed. Women used them more frequently than men, and noted a higher level of side-effects.
A 38-year-old woman developed focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver after she had received a 4-month treatment with intraconazole 200 mg/d for a fungal infection of her fingernails. Because the patient underwent yearly liver ultrasound examinations because of the removal of a breast carcinoma, when the tumor was discovered incidentally, it was clear that it had developed within the past year after she had begun receiving intraconazole. Although various chemical agents and drugs have been considered as possible etiologic factors in the development of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver, cases occurring after intraconazole therapy have not been reported before. Apart from the theoretical considerations with regard to the pathogenesis of nodular hyperplasia of the liver, this case could gain practical importance, as it shows a new adverse effect of a drug that has been used in more than 34 million patients over the past 10 years. Furthermore, this case should draw attention to the possibility of drug-induced benign hepatic tumors, as they may mimic malignant and metastatic disorders, which might be especially alarming in patients undergoing routine examinations after removal of malignant tumors, such as our patient.
It is not well-known yet how granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) affects nonischemic cardiomyopathy, though its beneficial effects on acute myocardial infarction are well-established. We hypothesize that G-CSF beneficially might affect nonischemic cardiomyopathy through the direct cardioprotective effects. Here, we show that a single injection of doxorubicin (DOX, 15 mg/kg) induced left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction in mice within 2 weeks, and that these effects were significantly attenuated by human recombinant G-CSF (100 microg/kg/day for 5 days). G-CSF also protected hearts against DOX-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy/degeneration, fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and down regulation of GATA-4 and sarcomeric proteins, myosin heavy chain, troponin I and desmin, both in vivo and in vitro. Cardiac cyclooxygenase-2 was upregulated and G-CSF receptor was downregulated in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, but both of those effects were largely reversed by G-CSF. No DOX-induced apoptotic effects were seen, nor were there any changes in tumor necrosis factor-alpha or transforming growth factor-beta1 levels. Among downstream mediators of G-CSF receptor signaling, DOX-induced cardiomyopathy involved inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK); the ERK inactivation was reversed by G-CSF. Inhibition of ERK activation, but not cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition, completely abolished beneficial effect of G-CSF on cardiac function. G-CSF did not promote differentiation of bone marrow cells into cardiomyocytes according to the experiment using green fluorescent protein-chimeric mice, and inhibition of CXCR4+ cell homing using AMD3100 did not diminish the effect of G-CSF. Finally, G-CSF was also effective when administered after cardiomyopathy was established. In conclusion, these findings imply the therapeutic usefulness of G-CSF mainly through restoring ERK activation against DOX-induced nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
Interstitial nephritis is a recognized complication of methicillin therapy. Hemorrhagic cystitis due to methicillin has not been emphasized. Evidence of hemorrhagic cystitis developed in six patients receiving methicillin therapy and was confirmed by cystoscopy in three of them.
The all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the treatment of first line of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA is usually well tolerated, but a few major side effects can be observed, ATRA syndrome (RAS) being the most important of them, potentially fatal. The manifestations of this Syndrome are fever, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, hypotension, liver dysfunction and renal failure.
We studied to the 29 patients diagnosed in (January of 2002 - December of 2004) of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which were treated with ATRA, all received the 45 dose of mg/m(2)/d . The diagnosis of the leukemia was made by citomorphologist analysis. The criterion of renal insufficiency, it was an increase of the creatinina superior to 20% of the basal level. The definition of the transretinoico acid Syndrome was based on the clinical criteria of Frankel.
Fourteen patients presented the Transretinoico Syndrome (48.3%), 11 of which (37.9%) died. The fundamental differences between the patients with or without ATRA were: fever (14 vs. 9, p=0,017), gain of weight (14 vs 0, p=0,000), pleural effusion (14 vs 2, p=0.000), pulmonary infiltrates (13 vs 1, p=0,000), cardiac failure (12 versus 2, p=0,000), respiratory distress (12 versus 4, p=0,003), presence of renal failure (10 vs 4, p=0,02), necessity of substitute renal treatment (6 vs 0, p=0,006) and arterial hypotension (12 vs. 3, p=0,001). The acute renal failure appeared in 10 of the 14 patients with SAR (71.4%), to 12+/-5 (1-25) days of the beginning of the treatment and their duration it was of 14+/-5 (1-46) days. Six (60%) needed substitute renal treatment and 5 (50%) died. Of the patients who survived, only a patient continues in dialysis. In both patient in that renal biopsy was made, the study showed signs of cortical necrosis.
The appearance of acute renal failure in the course of the SAR is frequent, being observed deterioration of the renal function that needs substitute renal treatment in more than half the cases. The association of RAS with renal failure entails the high mortality (50%). The diagnosis and the precocious restoration of suitable the preventive measures and therapeutic are very important to avoid in possible the this serious complication of the treatment with ATRA.
We report a 76-year-old woman who developed TdP ventricular tachycardia induced by combined use of clarithromycin and disopyramide. She had a history of myocardial infarction 5 years earlier and has taken disopyramide for supraventricular arrhythmias. In addition, she had taken clarithromycin for upper respiratory tract infection. On admission, an ECG showed prolongation of QTc interval to 0.71 seconds and self-terminating TdP occurred several times. Disopyramide was metabolized by the cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4 and clarithromycin competitively inhibits this enzyme, probably resulting in an increase in plasma concentration of disopyramide. We should consider this possibility when prescribing clarithromycin in combination with antiarrhythmic agent disopyramide.
Hepatic myofibroblasts are central for the development of liver fibrosis associated with chronic liver diseases, and blocking their accumulation may prevent fibrogenesis. Cannabinoids are the active components of marijuana and act via 2 G-protein-coupled receptors, CB1 and CB2. Here, we investigated whether liver fibrogenic cells are a target of cannabinoids.
CB2 receptors were characterized in biopsy specimens of normal human liver and active cirrhosis by immunohistochemistry, and in cultures of hepatic stellate cells and hepatic myofibroblasts by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunocytochemistry, and GTPgammaS assays. Functional studies were performed in cultured hepatic myofibroblasts and activated hepatic stellate cells. Carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis was studied in mice invalidated for CB2 receptors.
In liver biopsy specimens from patients with active cirrhosis of various etiologies, CB2 receptors were expressed in nonparenchymal cells located within and at the edge of fibrous septa in smooth muscle alpha-actin-positive cells. In contrast, CB2 receptors were not detected in normal human liver. CB2 receptors were also detected in cultured hepatic myofibroblasts and in activated hepatic stellate cells. Their activation triggered potent antifibrogenic effects, namely, growth inhibition and apoptosis. Growth inhibition involved cyclooxygenase-2, and apoptosis resulted from oxidative stress. Finally, mice invalidated for CB2 receptors developed enhanced liver fibrosis following chronic carbon tetrachloride treatment as compared with wild-type mice.
These data constitute the first demonstration that CB2 receptors are highly up-regulated in the cirrhotic liver, predominantly in hepatic fibrogenic cells. Moreover, this study also highlights the antifibrogenic role of CB2 receptors during chronic liver injury.
Liver cirrhosis remains a difficult-to-treat disease with a substantial morbidity and mortality rate. There is an emerging body of data purporting a pivotal role of the activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the process of cirrhosis. Several anticirrhotic agents have been developed over the past few years, and most of them exert their effects by indirectly inhibiting the p38 pathway. Effect of a selective p38 inhibitor is yet to be reported. In this study, we evaluated the salutary effect of FR-167653 (FR), a selective p38 inhibitor, in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced rat cirrhotic model. Twenty rats were assigned into four groups: Sham, olive oil only; Control, CCl(4) in olive oil; FR50, FR 50 mg/kg/day and CCl(4); and FR100, FR 100 mg/kg/day and CCl(4). FR dose-dependently inhibited activation of p38 and had an ameliorating effect on cirrhosis formation. Significant dose-dependent reduction in alpha-smooth muscle actin immunostaining and hydroxyproline content of the liver was noticed in the FR-treated rats. Also densitometric analysis showed a significant reduction in azan-stained area in the FR-treated rats. These fibrotic changes were observed in the myofibroblasts including the hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts. mRNA expression of runt-related protein 2 (Runx2), a profibrogenic transcription factor, was significantly low in FR-treated livers, indicating that Runx2 might be a key downstream regulator of the p38 pathway. A similar reduction in expression of Smad4 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was noticed in the FR-treated rats. In conclusion, FR treatment exerted a significant beneficial effect in a CCl(4)-induced rat cirrhotic model. The ameliorating effect of FR could be partially attributable to an inhibition of the Smad4/p38/Runx2 axis in the cirrhotic liver.
Ifosfamide can be responsible for acute central neurotoxicity in children and adolescents treated for cancer. The signs of acute encephalopathy most frequently observed are: alteration of consciousness, cerebellar syndrome, asthenia, urinary incontinence, cranial nerve palsy, and seizures. Various combinations of these signs may occur, but disorders of consciousness and drowsiness are common. We describe the case of a young man presenting with reversible acute hypomanic disorder during ifosfamide-based chemotherapy and discuss the possible mechanisms of this toxicity.
We have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate. In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso). Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen (TGR) were used. In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure and maximal contraction (+dP/dt(max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats (in g LV wt/100 g body wt, 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004, respectively). The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-AR and upregulation of LV beta-AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats. The decrease in the heart rate (HR) induced by the beta-AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats (-9.9 +/- 1.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on HR was similar in both strains. These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta-AR agonist-induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.
Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) plays an important role in the formation of endoxifen, the active metabolite of tamoxifen. In this study the association between the most prevalent CYP2D6 null-allele in Caucasians (CYP2D6*4) and breast cancer mortality was examined among all incident users of tamoxifen in a population-based cohort study. Breast cancer mortality was significantly increased in patients with the * 4/*4 genotype (HR = 4.1, CI 95% 1.1-15.9, P = 0.041) compared to wild type patients. The breast cancer mortality increased with a hazard ratio of 2.0 (CI 95% 1.1-3.4, P = 0.015) with each additional variant allele. No increased risk of all-cause mortality or all-cancer mortality was found in tamoxifen users carrying a CYP2D6*4 allele. The risk of breast cancer mortality is increased in tamoxifen users with decreased CYP2D6 activity, consistent with the model in which endoxifen formation is dependent on CYP2D6 activity.
1. The effect of chemical sympathectomy with 6-OH-dopamine (6-OHDA) on the onset of adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH)-induced hypertension was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 23). 2. 6-OHDA injection produced a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 100 +/- 5 mmHg control to 74 +/- 4 mmHg post-6-OHDA Treatment Day 1 (P less than 0.001), but did not alter food or water intake, urine volume or electrolyte excretion. 3. Compared with sham injection, ACTH-treated rats showed an increase in blood pressure (sham: 98 +/- 7 mmHg; ACTH: 123 +/- 9 mmHg on Treatment Day 10; P less than 0.01), loss of bodyweight, and increases in water intake and urine volume. 4. The magnitude of the blood pressure rise on ACTH was greater in 6-OHDA-treated rats than in intact control rats. Metabolic changes were similar. 5. Chemical sympathectomy with 6-OHDA did not delay or block the onset of ACTH hypertension in the rat.
Arterial reocclusion has not been systematically studied despite the fact that 13% of patients in the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke rt-PA Trial deteriorated following initial improvement, suggesting that reocclusion might be responsible for poor clinical outcome in some of these patients.
Consecutive stroke patients treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) within 3 hours and an M1 or M2 middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion on pre-TPA transcranial Doppler (TCD) were monitored up to 2 hours after TPA bolus. Reocclusion was defined as the Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia flow decrease by >/=1 grades and no hemorrhage on repeat CT. The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scores (mRS) were obtained by a neurologist independently of TCD.
Sixty patients with median prebolus NIHSS score of 16 (range 6 to 28, 90% with >/=10 points) had TPA bolus at 130 +/- 32 minutes (median 120 minutes, 58% within the first 2 hours). Recanalization was complete in 18 (30%), partial in 29 (48%), and none in 13 (22%) patients. Reocclusion occurred in 34% of patients with any initial recanalization (16/47): in 4 of 16 patients with complete recanalization (22%), and in 12 of 29 patients with partial recanalization (41%). Reocclusion was detected in four patients (25%) before TPA bolus, in three (19%) by 30 minutes after bolus, in three (19%) by the end of infusion, and in six (37%) by 60 to 120 minutes. Before reocclusion, those patients had earlier median timing of recanalization: 130 versus 180 minutes after stroke onset compared with those who recanalized without reocclusion (p = 0.01). Median prebolus NIHSS score in the reocclusion group was 13.5 versus 17 (rest, NS), whereas at 2 and 24 hours, their NIHSS scores were higher: 14 versus 9 and 16 versus 6 points (p </= 0.04). Deterioration followed by improvement by >/=4 NIHSS points occurred in 8 of 16 (50%) patients with reocclusion versus 10% (rest) (p < 0.05). In-hospital mortality was 25 versus 3% (p < 0.0001). At 3 months, good outcome (mRS score of 0 to 1) was achieved by 8% of patients with no recanalization, by 33% of patients with reocclusion, and by 50% of patients with stable recanalization (p </= 0.05), and mortality was 42% with no early recanalization, 33% after reocclusion, and 8% in patients with stable recanalization (p </= 0.05).
Early reocclusion occurs in 34% of TPA-treated patients with any initial recanalization, accounting for two-thirds of deteriorations following improvement. Reocclusion occurs more often in patients with earlier and partial recanalization, leading to neurologic deterioration and higher in-hospital mortality. However, patients with reocclusion have better long-term outcomes than patients without any early recanalization.
To compare the suppressive effects of tramadol and low-dose ketamine on postoperative hyperalgesia after remifentanil-based anaesthesia.
A total number of sixty ASA I - II adult patients who undergone the operation of cranio-cervical region were assigned to three groups randomly, controlled group (Group C), tramadol group (Group T) and low-dose ketamine group (Group K). Before the end of surgery, Group T was given tramadol 0.3 mg/kg, Group K was given ketamine 0.5 mg/kg and Group C wasn't given any medicine. When the visual analogue scale (VAS) score of the group C was over five, tramadol 0.3 mg/kg was given to the patients. The four-level verbal rating scale after trachea extubation, VAS score, the time of requiring analgesia again by patients and adverse drug reactions such as nausea, vomit, diplopia and hallucination were recorded for 24 hours after surgery.
After operation, the VAS score of Group C was much higher than that of Group K in the first 4 hours and Group T was higher than Group K during 2, 3 and 4 hours (P < 0.05). The time of requiring analgesia by patients in Group C and Group T was earlier than Group K. The adverse drug reaction showed no significant difference in three groups.
Low-dose ketamine had significant suppressive effect on patients with postoperative hyperalgesia and acute opioid tolerance after remifentanil-based anaesthesia.
A 66-year-old female with chronic renal failure received five doses of procainamide and developed marked QT interval prolongation and recurrent episodes of torsades de pointes, which were temporally related to high serum n-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) levels and not to procainamide levels. Repeated hemodialysis was effective in lowering NAPA levels. Torsades de pointes is a potential hazard of NAPA accumulation during procainamide administration to patients with renal insufficiency.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 genotyping in predicting disease-free survival and toxicity in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. DNA from 91 patients was genotyped using the AmpliChip CYP450 GeneChip, Roche that facilitates the classification of individuals by testing 27 alleles. When patients were grouped into group 1 (*4/*4, *4/*41, *1/*5 and *2/*5) and group 2 (the remaining genotypes), a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) was observed between groups (P = 0.016). The mean DFS in group 1 was 95 months in contrast with 119 months in group 2. No significant relationship was found between the CYP2D6 genotype classification and severe, mild or no toxicity (P = 0.2). Nevertheless, severe, and mild toxicity was more frequent among poor metabolizer patients than in patients with a normal metabolizer pattern (18.8 and 43.8% vs. 10.7 and 36%, respectively). In breast cancer, patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, non-functional and severely impaired CYP2D6 variants are associated with a worse DFS and with a higher frequency of severe and mild toxicities. Larger studies of the CYP2D6 genotype-clinical outcomes association are needed to complement initial results.
