Mt. Oyama in Miyakejima Island erupted in June, 2000. All Miyake villagers were forced to evacuate from the island in September, 2000, due to continuous eruptions and emissions of unsafe amounts of volcanic gas, mainly SO2. From February, 2005, Miyake villagers returned to the island despite volcanic gas still being emitted.
This study examines the 2-yr changes in Miyake residents' respiratory systems from autumn 2004 to November 2006.
The study population was 823 Miyake adult residents who participated in the health check-up in 2006. Respiratory effects were evaluated by a questionnaire for respiratory symptoms and spirometry. SO2 has been continuously monitored at 7 sampling points of the inhabited area. The mean SO2 concentration from February 2005 to November 2006 was 0.031 ppm. The area was categorized into 4 areas by SO2 concentration, namely, areas L, H-1, H-2 and H-3, where average SO2 concentrations were 0.019, 0.026, 0.032, and 0.045 ppm, respectively.
The study subjects showed no deterioration in lung function. Prevalence of cough and phlegm among all participants were significantly higher in 2006 than in 2004, and age-, sex- and smoking-adjusted odds ratios of cough and phlegm were 1.75 (95%CI 1.33-2.30) and 1.44 (1.12-1.87). Prevalence of chronic bronchitis-like symptoms among normosusceptive subjects in 2006 was 4.1% which was significantly higher than that of 2.1% in 2004 (p=0.035). Compared to area L, the frequencies of phlegm and irritation of the nose were significantly increased in areas H-2 and H-3.
SO2 exposure-related respiratory symptoms were observed in adult Miyakejima residents after returning to the island.
The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of irbesartan, carvedilol, and irbesartan plus carvedilol on the expression of tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) mRNA and protein in rat myocardium after myocardial infarction (MI). MI was induced in male Wistar rats by ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Irbesartan at 50 mg/kg/day, carvedilol at 1 mg/kg/day, irbesartan plus carvedilol, or placebo was administered intragastrically; expression of TF and TFPI mRNA and protein was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The relative left ventricle weights were lower in all three treatment groups than in the placebo group, with the lowest relative weight in the irbesartan plus carvedilol group (P < 0.001). The size of the infarcted area was lower in the carvedilol and the combined groups than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The levels of expression of TF and TFPI mRNA and protein were lower in the combined group than in the placebo group or the carvedilol group (P < 0.001). Treatment with irbesartan plus carvedilol reduced the expression of TF and TFPI mRNA and protein after MI in rats, and combined treatment with both agents had greater effects than the single agents alone. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of these drugs may include anticoagulation and that combined therapy with both agents is an option that should be evaluated further.
Polymorphisms of the ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member -1 (ABCB1) gene that codes for P-glycoprotein could influence the efflux of morphine from the central nervous system affecting its analgesic action. We investigated the effect of ABCB1 gene polymorphisms on analgesia and the development of persistent pain in post caesarean patients.
Women of Chinese descent who received spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal morphine for elective caesarean section were recruited. They were given intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia pump for postoperative analgesia. Blood samples were collected and analysed for the presence of C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene. We primarily investigated the association between ABCB1 polymorphisms and the effect of morphine. In a postpartum phone survey of the subjects six months after surgery, the occurrence of persistent abdominal wound scar pain was established.
We found no significant statistical difference in total morphine consumption, pain scores and side effects among the various genotypes. For C3435T polymorphism, there was a trend towards the association of the T allele and persistent pain for three months after surgery but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.07). The TT genotype had the longest mean survival time of wound pain in comparison with CT and CC genotypes (P=0.004 and P=0.014, respectively).
Polymorphisms of ABCB1 were not associated with differences in morphine use in the first 24h after surgery. Women with the T allele of C3435T polymorphism showed a trend towards a higher risk of developing persistent postoperative pain.
We report on an 18-year-old woman with secondary generalized seizure, who developed an auditory disturbance (flat a tone) after carbamazepine (CBZ) administration. She used to have brief episodes of conjugate deviation of the eyes to the right, head heaviness, teleopsia, and visual hallucination since 16 years of age. At the age of 18 years, she developed a tonic-clonic seizures during sleep, and was placed on CBZ 400 mg/day. Immediately after taking the medication, she developed auditory disturbance while she played the musical instruments: she felt as if she played the musical note almost a half tone lower. On admission, neurological examinations and magnetic resonance images of the brain were normal. Electroencephalogram at rest was normal. However, intravenous diphenhydramine injection induced spikes in the left temporo-occipital region, followed by diffuse spike and wave complex. Although the serum CBZ level was reduced to the therapeutic level by lowering CBZ administration from 200 to 150 mg/day, she continued to have the same auditory disturbance. When CBZ administration was discontinued, the symptoms also disappeared. It remains unknown whether such a subtle side effect of CBZ is a common thing, or it can be recognized only by persons who are well trained in music.
To investigate sex and menstrual cycle effects in response to cocaine administration, data from existing studies were analyzed. First, responses to a single delivery of 0.4 mg/kg smoked cocaine were investigated. Women reported lower ratings for measures of paranoid/suspicious and heart racing/pounding than did men. In addition, women in the luteal phase reported diminished ratings for a measure of feel high than did both women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and men. Second, responses to up to 6 deliveries of 0.4 mg/kg smoked cocaine were investigated. Women, compared with men, had lower ratings on feel high, heart racing/pounding, and feel stimulated. Results suggest that there are significant sex and menstrual phase differences in the subjective effects of cocaine.
Disturbances in colour vision are a well-reported adverse ocular effect to toxic levels of digoxin. We present a case history of a patient with both colour vision changes and transient visual field defects to therapeutic serum levels of digoxin.
2-Hydroxy-(1-hydroxy-[(1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)amino]-2-ethyl)-5-benzamide (labetalol), a new alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was employed in 21 patients with severe hypertension by slow (6 patients) and rapid (15 patients) i.v. infusion. A marked and significant fall of blood pressure was observed in both groups, though more gradual in patients treated by slow infusion. A rapid blood pressure fall with cardiac output decrease was observed by passing from supine to standing position in the first hours after infusion. Therefore, it is advisable to keep a supine position for a few hours. Plasma renin activity decreased after labetalol infusion, but basal plasma renin levels were not related to hypotensive effect of labetalol. In slow infusion patients, plasma noradrenaline levels increased and no changes of plasma adrenaline levels were observed during infusion. The most likely explanation of these variations is an increase of sympathetic activity secondary to hypotension, caused by labetalol, whereas a technical interference seems to be excluded. The simultaneous blockade of alpha- and beta-receptors can inhibit, in this case, the pressor effects of the sympathetic reflex.
The response pattern of the autonomic nervous system was investigated after central administration (intra-cisternal, vertebral artery) of amphetamine, morphine, fentanyl, dextromoramide and the substance R 28935, chemically related to the neuroleptic agent pimozide. Effects on the sympathetic system were measured by recording electrical discharges of fibres of the (preganglionic) major splanchnic nerve in anaesthetized cats; those on the vagal system by recording the heart rate in anaesthetized dogs under beta-adrenoceptor blockade; the baroreceptor reflex was elicited by the blood pressure increase of i.v. injected angiotensin. All substances decreased the spontaneous discharge rate of the splanchnic nerve. Amphetamine facilitated the vagally mediated reflex bradycardia and this was antagonized by the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent piperoxan. Amphetamine did not affect the resting heart rate, as has already been shown for clonidine and related substances. The narcotic analgesics lowered the resting heart rate but did not facilitate the baroreceptor reflex response. R 28935 neither influenced resting heart rate nor the baroreceptor reflex response in beta-blocked dogs. On the basis of the vagal response pattern it was therefore possible to distinguish between 3 groups of central hypotensive drugs.
There is a dose-effect relationship between doxorubicin and the incidence of symptomatic cardiac failure. It is generally thought that doses below 500-550 mg/m2 are safe but, when objective measures of cardiac function are used, it becomes apparent that degrees of cardiac failure occur at doses below this. We present here the case histories of two patients who developed very severe cardiac failure at cumulative doses well below 500 mg/m2 but who survived their initial cardiac illness due to aggressive intervention. In one case, the patient was successfully treated by orthotopic cardiac transplantation.
We studied the effect of immunotherapy using recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in combination with a differentiating agent, sodium butyrate (NaBut), on experimental 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant liver metastasis from colorectal cancer in rats. For this purpose, we used direct liver injection of 5-FU resistant cells, PRObRI, in syngeneic BDIX rats to establish liver tumors. The growth of liver metastasis was followed before and after NaBut/rIL-2 treatment by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The presence of liver tumors was checked by MRI 7 days after tumor cell injection. Evaluable rats were then assigned randomly to a control and an experimental group. The different treatments were started on day 10 and administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Combined NaBut/rIL-2 treatment followed by MRI on days 56 and 91 was shown both to significantly reduce the growth of liver tumors and to prevent extrahepatic spread. In addition, NaBut/rIL-2 treatment induced a complete regression in 50% of the rats which remained free of disease.
The improved survival of very low-birth-weight infants, who require prolonged hospitalization and many invasive procedures, increases the risks for nosocomial illnesses, such as disseminated fungal infections. In a 2-year period, systemic fungal infections were clinically diagnosed in ten infants. This necessitated the institution of antifungal therapy in extremely premature infants (mean birth weight 788 g, mean gestational age 28 weeks) despite the paucity of knowledge about the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of these drugs in the very immature patient. Despite the absence of reported toxicity in infants and older children, severe nephrotoxicity was commonly observed with oliguria/anuria, temporally related to the administration of amphotericin B in seven of these infants. Additional evidence of nephrotoxicity included either a rise in creatinine levels (greater than or equal to 1.3 mg/dL), an increase in BUN (greater than or equal to 30 mg/dL), hypokalemia (less than or equal to 2.9 mEq/L), or hyperkalemia (greater than or equal to 6.0 mEq/L). Six of these seven drug-toxic infants died. Interruption of amphotericin B therapy, with reinstitution at a lower dose, was the most successful factor in alleviating the anuria. There is an urgent need for detailed pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies of antifungal agents in immature infants.
To study the effects of volume preload with hydroxyethylstarch 6% (HES) on the changes in arterial blood pressure and heart rate following propofol/fentanyl induction of anesthesia.
Seventy five patients, divided into three groups, scheduled for orthopedic surgery were allocated randomly to receive either no preload or 500 ml, or 1000 ml of 6% HES respectively over 20 minutes period prior to anesthetic induction. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1.5 microg.kg(-1) and propofol 2.5 mg.kg(-1). Cardiovascular parameters were monitored for 5 minutes following induction.
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased significantly (P<0.001) in all groups after anesthetic induction. Blood pressure recorded at 5 minutes was 76% of the baseline values in the control group and in the HES 500 group and was 78% in the HES 1000 group. Changes in the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean blood pressure (MBP) were also similar in the three groups. There was no significant difference between the three groups in the HR decline too.
Administration of 6% HES as a preload did not attenuate the decrease in blood pressure following induction of anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl.
Therapy employing the fluoroquinolone antibiotic, trovafloxacin (TVX) was curtailed due to idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Previous studies in mice showed that a nonhepatotoxic inflammatory stress induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) synergized with a nonhepatotoxic dose of TVX to cause liver injury. The purpose of this study was to explore mechanisms by which TVX interacts with TNF to cause liver injury. TVX pretreatment prolonged the peak of plasma TNF after its administration. This prolongation of TNF by TVX was critical to the development of hepatotoxicity. The prolongation of TNF concentration in plasma was primarily due to reduced clearance when compared with secondary biosynthesis. TNF is cleared from plasma by binding to soluble TNF receptors (TNFRs) which are eliminated by the kidney; however, the plasma concentrations of soluble TNFRs were not reduced, and biomarkers of renal dysfunction were not elevated in TVX/TNF-treated mice. Two injections of TNF mimicked the prolongation of the TNF peak by TVX and caused liver injury, but injury was less severe than after TVX/TNF coexposure. TVX enhanced the induction of proinflammatory cytokines by TNF. Additionally, TVX sensitized Hepa1c1c7 cells to TNF-induced killing in a concentration-dependent manner and increased both potency and efficacy of TNF to activate effector caspases that were critically involved in cell death from TVX/TNF coexposure. In summary, TVX reduced the clearance of TNF independent of either receptor shedding or kidney dysfunction. Additionally, TVX interacted with TNF to enhance inflammation and sensitize hepatocytes to TNF-induced cell death.
Previous studies indicate that 1-bromopropane (1BP) has neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity both in humans and animals. The present study investigated strain differences in susceptibility to 1BP and identified possible biological factors that determine such susceptibility. Twenty-four male mice of each of the three strains (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and BALB/cA) were divided into four groups of six each and exposed to 1BP at 0, 50, 110, and 250 ppm for 8 h/day for 28 days by inhalation. At the end of exposure period, the relative susceptibilities of each strain to 1BP-mediated hepatotoxicity and male reproductive toxicity were evaluated. The contributing factors to strain-dependent susceptibility were assessed by determination of hepatic CYP2E1 levels, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, glutathione (GSH) status, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and heme oxygenase-1 mRNA levels. Liver histopathology showed significantly larger area of liver necrosis and more degenerative lobules in BALB/cA in the order of BALB/cA > C57BL/6J > DBA/2J. BALB/cA showed higher CYP2E1 protein level and lower total GSH content and GST activity in the liver than DBA/2J. These results indicate that BALB/cA mice are the most susceptible to hepatotoxicity of 1BP among the three strains tested, and that CYP2E1, GSH level/GST activity may contribute to the susceptibility to 1BP hepatotoxicity. Exposure to > or = 50 ppm of 1BP also decreased sperm count and sperm motility and increased sperms with abnormal heads in all three strains mice in a dose-dependent manner. Comparison with previous studies in rats indicates that mice are far more susceptible than rats to 1BP regarding hepatotoxicity and reproductive toxicity.
Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ) is a novel antimicrotubule agent with anti-tumor activity against ovarian and breast carcinomas. Its activity when administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has not been studied.
Patients with relapsed NHL were treated with a 3-hour infusion of 200 mg/m2 of Taxol every 3 weeks in an outpatient setting. All patients received premedication (dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine) to prevent allergic reactions. Responses were assessed after two courses of therapy, and patients who achieved at least partial remission (PR) continued to receive Taxol for a maximum of eight courses.
Of 60 eligible patients, 54 (90%) were assessable for treatment toxicity and 53 (88%) were for treatment response (22 with primary refractory and 31 with relapsed disease). Twelve patients (23%) achieved a PR (n = 6) or complete remission (CR; n = 6) (95% confidence interval, 12% to 36%). Responses were observed in intermediate-grade (31%), low-grade (14%), and mantle-cell (17%) lymphomas. In the intermediate-grade lymphomas, there was a trend for a higher response rate in relapsed versus primary refractory disease (54% v 13%; P = .08). Treatment-related toxicity included alopecia (100%), peripheral neuropathy (37%), myalgia or arthralgia (25%), and neutropenic fever (11%). None of the patients had allergic reactions or cardiac toxicity.
At this dose and schedule, Taxol is an active agent in patients with relapsed NHL and can be safely administered in an outpatient setting. Combination programs with Taxol should be investigated for treatment of NHL.
Drugs that prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia. In recent years, spontaneous reports have highlighted these complications in patients receiving certain antihistamines (e.g., terfenadine or astemizole) or an agent for the treatment of incontinence (terodiline). Examination of these reports has revealed that hepatic disease or concomitant therapy with ketoconazole or macrolide antibiotics may increase the risk of QT prolongation or torsades in patients receiving terfenadine. In patients receiving astemizole, doses exceeding that recommended or concomitant therapy with ketoconazole or macrolide antibiotics have been implicated in the increased risk of these complications. With terodiline (which remains investigational in the United States), the risk of QT prolongation and torsades are of particular concern in the frail elderly, who are most likely to be treated with this agent. A possible explanation for the elevated risk may be marked increases in the elimination half-life and serum level of the drug in this group. The lessons learned from the experiences with these drugs hold implications for the future development of agents that prolong the QT interval and suggest the need for dose-response relation data and metabolic evaluations to define the subpopulations at particular risk.
In contrast to the well known chlorpromazine-induced cholestatic hepatitis, we report the case of a schizophrenic patient who presents a cytolytic hepatitis, without any prior hepatic disease. Mr G. was first hospitalized for depressive symptomatology. A pseudo-nevrotic schizophrenia was diagnosed. Pretherapeutic clinical and biological data were normal. A treatment with chlorpromazine 400 mg/day was given. At day 8, the patient was still anxious and began to be agitated. An increase to 500 mg/day of chlorpromazine posology and an addition of haloperidol 200 mg/day was implemented. At day 10, the following clinical symptoms appeared: 38.6 degrees C fever; headache; myalgia; epigastralgia and hypocondrium pain. Biological hepatitis disturbances (ALAT, 984 U/L; ASAT, 414 U/L) and hypereosinophilia with normal white cell count were found. Clinical and biological investigations were normal. Blood-culture, A, B, C hepatitis, HIV and CMV serologies were negative. Neuroleptic treatment was discontinued. Evolution to normality of the disturbances and biological data suggested a cytolytic hepatitis. Mr G... remained treated with flupentixol without side-effects. Phenothiazine-induced cholestatis is frequent, mild, and recovers spontaneously. The biological mechanism is supposed to be immunologic. Prevalence of biological hepatic disturbances is 10 to 20% with chlorpromazine in long-term treatment. More often, symptomatology is the same; jaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain, fever. Although pharmacological data suggest for a cytotoxic activity of phenothiazines, cytolytic hepatitis is poorly described. Maximum range of transaminase blood level reported in previous studies is about 400 U/l. This level is not clearly correlated with hepatic cell lysis. Few cases of hepatic necrosis have been reported. In all cases, preexistent hepatic injuries were observed. Chlorpromazine-induced cytolytic hepatitis is uncommon and cholestatic hepatitis mild. Biological hepatic parameters investigations remain necessary during neuroleptic treatment.
Two patients who developed a severe but reversible cholestatic jaundice during and after treatment with an amoxicillin/clavulanic acid preparation (Augmentin) are described. The diagnosis of drug-induced intrahepatic cholestasis was based on the clinical course, biochemical pattern and on histological findings. Since amoxicillin alone does not induce liver injury, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid or clavulanic acid alone could be responsible for this adverse reaction, probably through a metabolic idiosyncrasy or a hypersensitivity mechanism. Although more than 100 cases of hepatotoxic reactions have been reported to the pharmaceutical company (Beecham Laboratories) and several reports have been published, the incidence of hepatotoxicity of this antibiotic is relatively rare, since this antibiotic has been widely used. However, recognition of this benign and reversible cholestatic syndrome is important to avoid unnecessary, expensive and invasive diagnostic procedures.
After a single administration of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA; i.p.:600 mg/kg) on day 8 of gestation in the mouse embryotoxicity and amniotic fluid (AF) cholinesterase (ChE) were evaluated on day 16 of gestation. VPA treatment induced an increase in embryolethality, neural tube defects (exencephaly), cleft palate, deformed vertebrae, open eyes, and a reduction in fetal weight. In VPA-exposed fetuses AF total ChE (TChE) activity of exencephalic fetuses was higher than that of normal fetuses. However, in 3 out of 110 normal fetuses of the control group TChE activity was found in the AF. There was no correlation between blood contamination of AF and its TChE activity, either in non-exencephalic control or treated embryos. Using ethopropazine as a "pseudo"-ChE inhibitor in vitro, the percentage of acetyl-ChE in blood-contaminated AF was similar to that of fetal rather than maternal serum, indicating that AF was contaminated with fetal and not with maternal blood. VPA-induced exencephaly in mice may provide an animal model to further investigate biochemical markers for prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects.
Nephrosis-induced endothelial dysfunction is assumed to play a main role in cardiovascular morbidity. Adriamycin-induced proteinuria is a well-established rat model for nephrotic syndrome. However, induction of nephrosis by intravenous adriamycin administration might exert direct adriamycin cardiovasculotoxicity that could obscure or modify nephrosis-induced vascular dysfunction. The present study, therefore, investigated in vitro vascular function in the isolated thoracic aorta and isolated perfused hearts of rats with adriamycin nephrosis, as compared to non-nephrotic adriamycin exposed rats.
Adult rats received a single slow intravenous injection of either adriamycin (1.5 mg/kg, adriamycin nephrotic rats) or saline (healthy controls). In a third group of rats, the cardiovascular system, but not the kidneys, were exposed to adriamycin by transient clipping of renal arteries during adriamycin injection (adriamycin control rats).
Exposure of the kidneys to adriamycin induced severe proteinuria with corresponding systemic nephrosis, as apparent from hypercholesterolaemia. Adriamycin exposure of the vascular bed led to marked blunting of the aortic response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine (ACh), both in non-nephrotic and nephrotic rats. The nephrotic state reduced the bradykinin-induced increase in coronary flow and enhanced the aortic constrictor response to angiotensin II associated with reduced basal aortic NO-activity, as shown by the comparison between adriamycin nephrotic rats and healthy and adriamycin controls.
Vascular adriamycin exposure and nephrosis affect vascular function in a distinct and qualitatively different fashion in adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome. The differential effects of nephrosis and vascular adriamycin exposure have to be accounted for in the interpretation of vascular studies in adriamycin nephrosis.
Previous studies of the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on left ventricular function in depressed patients with moderate to severe ventricular impairment have focused primarily on imipramine hydrochloride. In a prior study, we found that although imipramine had no effect on ejection fraction as measured by first-pass radionuclide angiography, the treatment could not be tolerated by 50% of the patients because of intolerable drug-induced orthostatic hypotension. Nortriptyline hydrochloride is an effective antidepressant that, in depressed patients without heart disease, causes significantly less orthostatic hypotension than imipramine. To see if this advantage could be safely extended to patients with congestive failure, we measured the effect of nortriptyline on ejection fraction and blood pressure in 21 depressed patients with left ventricular impairment. Ejection fraction was unchanged by nortriptyline treatment, and orthostatic hypotension developed in only one (5%) of 21 patients. Nortriptyline emerges as a relatively safe treatment for depression in patients with left ventricular impairment.
Colchicine myopathy typically presents as painless muscle weakness. This report describes a post renal-transplant patient who presented with pain in both extremities bilaterally that was refractory to narcotic analgesics. He had been on low dose daily colchicine for 7 years. Laboratory, EMG, and biopsy findings all supported the diagnosis of colchicine myopathy. Symptoms subsided after discontinuation of colchicine. Myalgia as chief complaint is an unusual presentation of colchicine myopathy.
A 24-week double-blind study was conducted to compare haloperidol and thiothixene for efficacy and safety in 46 schizophrenic outpatients. In addition to the standard psychiatric rating scales, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE), and Evaluation of Social Functioning Rating (ESFR), two scales more sensitive to the incidence of treatment emergent depression were utilized. They were the Hamilton Depression Scale (HPRSD) and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZUNG). On the BPRS factors, haloperidol was significantly superior to thiothixene in Thought Disturbance and Hostility-Suspiciousness, and in Total symptomatology. Haloperidol was also significantly superior to thiothixene in Cognitive Disturbance on the HPRSD. Results of global evaluations suggested haloperidol produced slightly more rapid relief of symptoms than did thiothixene. The inclusion of the depression scales was useful in following patients who exhibited depressive symptoms; clinically significant depression was seen in 5 patients receiving haloperidol and 3 receiving thiothixene. A high incidence of akathisia in the thiothixene group was responsible for a statistically significant difference between groups in the number of central nervous system symptoms. Mean doses of test drugs were 17.5 mg/day for haloperidol an 31.8 mg/day for thiothixene. The study showed that haloperidol was equal to and in some parameters superior to thiothixene in producing improvement in the symptoms of psychosis.
Spinal antinociception produced by delta 9-tetrahydro-cannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) and other cannabinoid agonists has been suggested to be mediated by the release of dynorphin acting at the kappa opioid receptor. Alternatively, as cannabinoid receptors are distributed appropriately in the pain transmission pathway, cannabinoid agonists might act directly at the spinal level to inhibit nociception, without requiring dynorphin release. Here, these possibilities were explored using mice with a deletion of the gene encoding prodynorphin. Antinociceptive dose-response curves were constructed for spinal Delta(9)-THC and WIN 55,212-2 in prodynorphin knock-out mice and in wild-type littermates. WIN 55,212-2 and Delta(9)-THC were equipotent in the wild-type and prodynorphin knock-out mice. Spinal pretreatment with a kappa opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), did not alter the dose-response curves for either WIN 55,212-2 or Delta(9)-THC in prodynorphin knock-out and wild-type mice. However, the same dose of nor-BNI used blocked U50,488H-induced antinociception in both wild-type and prodynorphin knock-out mice, confirming kappa opioid receptor activity. Pretreatment with SR141716A, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist blocked the antinociceptive actions of both WIN 55,212-2 and Delta(9)-THC. These data support the conclusion that antinociception produced by spinal cannabinoids are likely to be mediated directly through activation of cannabinoid receptors without the requirement for dynorphin release or activation of kappa opioid receptors.
Expression of the E-cadherin cell adhesion molecule is reduced in several types of human carcinomas, and the protein serves as an invasion suppressor in vitro. To determine if mutations of the E-cadherin gene (on chromosome 16q22) contribute to epithelial tumorigenesis, 135 carcinomas of the endometrium and ovary were examined for alterations in the E-cadherin coding region. Four mutations were identified: one somatic nonsense and one somatic missense mutation, both with retention of the wild-type alleles, and two missense mutations with somatic loss of heterozygosity in the tumour tissue. These data support the classification of E-cadherin as a human tumour suppressor gene.
