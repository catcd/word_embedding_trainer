We conducted a search for rare, functional variants altering susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease that exploited knowledge of common variants associated with the same disease. We found that loss-of-function variants in ABCA7 confer risk of Alzheimer's disease in Icelanders (odds ratio (OR) = 2.12, P = 2.2 × 10(-13)) and discovered that the association replicated in study groups from Europe and the United States (combined OR = 2.03, P = 6.8 × 10(-15)).
It has previously been demonstrated that the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine induces hyperactivity in rodents, which is reversed by physostigmine but not by directly acting agonists such as pilocarpine. This may suggest that non-muscarinic actions of physostigmine may be responsible for its reversal of scopolamine-induced hyperactivity. We have found, in male Wistar rats, whose activity was measured on electromagnetic detector plates, that the central nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (3 mg/kg) reverses the blockade of scopolamine-induced behavioural activation induced by physostigmine. This suggests that activation of nicotinic receptors can counteract the effects of muscarinic blockade. Interestingly, however, treatment with nicotine does not block scopolamine-induced hyperactivity, suggesting that the exogenous and endogenous ligands may have different receptor or neuronal substrates.
A total of 51 previously untreated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with 130 mg/m2 carboplatin given every 4 weeks as an i.v. infusion on days 1, 3, and 5. Ten patients achieved a partial response and five, a minor response. The overall response rate was 20% (95% confidence limits, 8%-32%). The median duration of response was 3 months and the median overall survival was 4.5 months. Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia of WHO grade 3 occurred in 4%-6% of patients and grade 3 nausea and vomiting was observed in 8% of our subjects. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 3 (6%) patients. Apart from nausea and vomiting, nonhematologic toxicities above grade 2 were not observed. Further trials using carboplatin in NSCLC as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or radiation are warranted.
A total of 47 patients with unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with a regimen consisting of cisplatin (CDDP, 100 mg/m2), ifosfamide (IFX, 2 g/m2 x 3; with mesna) and vindesine (VDS, 3 mg/m2) (CIV). This regimen was given over a 3- or 5-week period. Among 40 completely evaluable patients, 19 partial responses (PRs) were observed, for a response rate of 47.5% (78.6% in squamous-cell carcinoma and 30.1% in adeno- and large-cell carcinoma); no complete responses (CRs) were obtained. The hematologic toxicity was not severe, but the renal toxicity was rather high; two patients developed acute renal failure and died of subsequent pancytopenia and sepsis. We concluded that the CIV regimen was more effective, especially against squamous-cell carcinoma, but more toxic than the combination of CDDP and VDS for non-small-cell lung cancer and that candidates for this therapy must be carefully chosen.
To evaluate the feasibility of adjuvant chemotherapy, we analyzed the toxicities of chemotherapy for primary breast cancer in Japanese women. Since the opening of the National Cancer Center Hospital East, 180 female breast cancer patients have received adjuvant chemotherapy or chemo-hormonal therapy following surgical treatment between June 1992 and December 1995. On the basis of informed consent about prognosis and adjuvant therapy, most patients decided to choose the type of cytotoxic chemotherapy themselves. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of oral fluoropyrimidine compounds (OFP), cyclophosphamide + adriamycin +/- 5-fluorouracil [CA(F)] or cyclophosphamide + methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil (CMF). Toxicity was determined using the Toxicity Grading Criteria of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG). Sixty-six patients received OFP, 59 CA(F) and the rest 55 CMF. The toxicity grading of leukocytes and neutrophils was significantly higher in patients treated with CA(F) or CMF than in those treated with OFP. Similar results were also seen relating to the toxicity of nausea/vomiting and alopecia. There was no statistical difference in the toxicity grading of hemoglobin, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GOT/GPT) and stomatitis/ gastritis between the three groups of patients. Interestingly, the number of patients that were forced to discontinue chemotherapy was higher in those receiving OFP than in those receiving CA(F) or CMF. Cytotoxic chemotherapy of CA(F) or CMF results in greater toxicity than OFP, but is tolerated and feasible in the adjuvant setting used in Japanese breast cancer patients from the viewpoint of toxicities by anticancer chemotherapy.
Chronic morphine drives adaptations in synaptic transmission thought to underlie opiate dependence. Here we examine the role of micro-opioid receptor (MOR) trafficking in one of these adaptations, specifically, changes in GABA transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). To address this question, we used a knock-in mouse, RMOR (for recycling MOR), in which genetic change in the MOR promotes morphine-induced receptor desensitization and endocytosis in GABA interneurons of the VTA. In wild-type mice (postnatal days 23-28) chronic morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily for 5 d), induced a cAMP-dependent increase in the probability of GABA release onto VTA dopamine neurons. The increased GABA release frequency correlated with physical dependence on morphine measured by counting somatic signs of morphine withdrawal, such as, tremors, jumps, rears, wet-dog shakes, and grooming behavior precipitated by subcutaneous administration of naloxone (NLX) (2 mg/kg). This adaptation in GABA release was prevented in RMOR mice given the same morphine treatment, implicating MOR trafficking in this morphine-induced change in plasticity. Importantly, treatment with the cAMP activity inhibitor rp-cAMPS [(R)-adenosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogenphosphorothioate) triethylammonium] (50 ng/0.5 microl), directly to the VTA, attenuated somatic withdrawal signs to systemic morphine produced by intra-VTA NLX (500 ng/0.5 microl), directly tying enhanced cAMP-driven GABA release to naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal in the VTA.
For previously treated advanced breast cancer, there is no standard second-line therapy. Combination chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (MFL regimen) had been reported as an effective and well tolerated regimen. From October 1993 to November 1995, we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy-treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2, on day 1 and continuous infusion of 5-FU, 3000 mg/m2, together with leucovorin, 300 mg/m2, for 48 h from day 1 to 2. Each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 weeks. Most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites, with lung metastasis predominant. Seven patients had been treated with anthracycline. Seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therapy. Median number of courses of MFL regimen given was six and the median cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was 68.35 mg/m2. One patient had complete response, seven had stable disease, none had partial response and five had progressive disease. The overall objective response rate was 7.6%. The median follow-up period was 14 months. Median survival was 16 months. Median progression-free survival was 5 months. A complete responder had relapse-free survival up to 17 months. Major toxicities were cardiotoxicity and leukopenia. Eight patients were dead in the last follow-up; two of them died of treatment-related toxicity. The MFL regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe toxicity at a fairly high rate. Administration of this regimen to breast cancer patients who have been treated by chemotherapy and those with impaired heart function requires careful attention.
We describe a 41-year-old woman receiving carbamazepine for epilepsy, in whom concurrent erythromycin stearate administration led to carbamazepine toxicity, including inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome. We review the literature on erythromycin-carbamazepine interaction and discuss the mechanism for such interaction.
Mice exposed to four or six hours of nitrous oxide or halothane differed from controls on a variety of tests conducted before weaning. Whereas many agents that produce behavioral terata have very different effects at different stages of brain development, these inhalant anesthetics had similar effects, whether exposure occurred on the 14th day of gestation or two days after birth. Both treatment times and both agents were associated with delays in the appearance of developmental landmarks and delays in the appearance of righting reflexes and locomotion. The level of general activity just before weaning tended to be low in all treated groups and was significantly depressed in males exposed to N2O postnatally. The distribution of activity scores was shifted significantly in both postnatal groups compared to controls. The data are compatible with human studies suggesting that inhalants at parturition have an effect on early behavior. The persistence of effects over the first three weeks of life does not fit with the idea that the behavioral effects are mediated by continued presence of the drug. The similar effects of the two agents, which produce very different degrees of anesthesia, supports earlier studies suggesting that the teratogenicity of inhalants is independent of the level of anesthesia produced.
When male rats were given a single dose of cadmium (Cd) (3.58 mg CdCl2 x H2O/kg, i.p.) 72 hr prior to sacrifice, the testicular 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities toward the substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB), ethacrynic acid (EAA), 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)-propane (EPNP), and cumene hydroperoxide (CHPx) decreased significantly as compared to controls. Cd also inhibited reduced glutathione (GSH) level while increasing the lipid peroxidation (LP) level significantly. When the animals were given a single dose of nickel (Ni) (59.5 mg NiCl2 x 6H2O/kg, i.p.) 16 hr prior to sacrifice, significant decreases were observed in EROD and GST activities toward CDNB, EAA, EPNP, and CHPx, and GSH level. No significant alterations were noted in DCNB GST activity and LP level by Ni. For the combined treatment, rats received the single dose of Ni 56 hr after the single dose of Cd and were killed 16 hr later. In these animals, lesser depressions were observed on EROD activity and LP level than those of Cd alone. The combination of metals significantly inhibited GST activities and GSH level but not to a greater degree than noted by Cd or Ni alone. Plasma testosterone levels of Cd-, Ni-, and combination-treated rats decreased significantly compared to controls. The strongest depression was achieved by Cd alone. Cd, both alone and in combination with Ni, increased the tissue Ni uptake significantly. Ni, however, did not produce such an effect on the tissue uptake of Cd in either case. Cd treatment caused interstitial edema and coagulation necrosis in seminiferous tubules and also caused fibrinoidal necrosis in vascular endothelium. Ni treatment did not produce any pathological testicular alterations compared to controls. Combined treatment produced fewer pathological alterations (i.e., only interstitial edema) than that of Cd treatment. These results reveal that the combination of Cd and Ni does nothave a synergistic effect on testicular xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, and in contrast, Ni has an ameliorating effect on pathological disturbances caused by Cd alone in the rat testis.
Zinc finger protein 191, ZNF24 and Zfp191 in both humans and mice belong to the SCAN domain subfamily of Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factors. Previous studies have suggested that Zfp191 is a pleiotropic factor involved in embryonic development, hematopoiesis and tumorigenesis. However, little is known about its target genes or its role in other physiological and pathological processes. We have identified the putative target genes of Zfp191, using an in silico genome-wide scan. Three hundred and fifty-five putative target genes were identified, which were enriched into the pathways of immune response according to the pathway analysis. These targets indicated that Zfp191 may function as a mediator of the immune response. This was verified in mice heterozygous for Zfp191 (Zfp191(+/-)) using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock model. After LPS injection, Zfp191(+/-) mice produced significantly less IL-1β and IL-6 compared to wild-type mice and were resistant to LPS-induced endotoxic shock. The loss of Zfp191 may suppress systemic inflammation by reducing these cytokine levels during LPS-induced endotoxic shock.
We have reported that myocardial ischemia increases nitric oxide (NO) production. Several lines of evidence suggest that NO reduces myocardial contraction. Therefore, we tested whether endogenous NO decreases the inotropic response of the ischemic myocardium and whether endogenous NO is beneficial in the metabolic function of ischemic myocardium.
The left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused with blood from the left carotid artery in 72 dogs. An infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of NO synthase, did not affect fractional shortening (FS) under nonischemic conditions. After reduction of perfusion pressure so that coronary blood flow decreased to 60% of the control value, FS of the perfused area decreased, and intravenous infusion of isoproterenol increased FS. Before and during intravenous infusion of isoproterenol under conditions of coronary hypoperfusion, FS was significantly increased in the L-NAME group compared with the untreated group. Both lactate extraction ratio and the pH in coronary venous blood were significantly lower in the L-NAME-treated group than in the untreated group during coronary hypoperfusion. Infusion of L-arginine prevented the effects of L-NAME in the ischemic myocardium.
These results indicate that endogenous NO reduces myocardial contractile function and improves myocardial metabolic function in the ischemic heart. The myocardial energy-sparing effect as well as coronary vasodilation due to NO may be beneficial to the ischemic myocardium.
We present the case of 48-year-old woman suffering from migraine with aura (MA) since menarche. During her life the patient frequently presented catamenial MA attacks with an increasing frequency during pregnancy in particular in the second and third trimesters, and then during breast-feeding. Treatment with oral contraceptive (OC) for endometriosis and later with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) for breast cancer produced a higher number of attacks. Instead, she referred an improvement with gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) for the treatment of endometriosis and then with tamoxifen as hormonal therapy after mastectomy and chemotherapy for breast cancer. We highlight the importance of physiological hormonal modification and hormonal therapies on the course of MA.
Lindane, an organochlorine pesticide, is recognized as a major public health concern because of its potential toxic effects on human health. Its persistence in the body fluids may lead to continuous blood circulation, liver exposure and hepatotoxicity. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible protective role of curcumin on lindane-induced hepatotoxicity. Forty-two healthy adult male Wistar rats were divided into seven groups of six rats each. Group I was given dimethylsulfoxide. A single dose of lindane (60 mg/kg bw) was given to group II. Lindane (30 mg/kg bw) was given daily to group III for 14 days. Treatment with curcumin (100 and 200 mg/kg) was given to groups IV and V before (pretreatment) and to groups VI and VII after (post-treatment) 14 days exposure of lindane. Oxidative stress parameters and antioxidative enzymes were investigated in the liver of exposed and treated rats. A significant increase in lipid peroxidation, and decrease in glutathione level, Superoxide dismutase catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and NADPH quinine reductase activities was observed in liver of rats exposed to lindane. Curcumin (Pre- and post-treatment) nearly normalized all these parameters. Histological alterations were also observed in the liver tissue after lindane exposure. Treatment with curcumin significantly prevented the lindane-induced histological alterations. In conclusion, curcumin has protective effect over lindane-induced oxidative damage in rat liver.
Mice exposed to 6 hours of 75% N2O or 0.5% halothane on the 14th day of gestation and mice exposed to 4 hours of 75% N2O or 0.5% halothane on the second day of life were tested for general activity at 3 ages. Just before weaning, all treated groups appeared hypoactive and there was a significant effect in the postnatal nitrous oxide group. Both postnatal groups had deviant distributions of scores, compared to sham-exposed controls. The main effect of treatment was greater in young adulthood, when the prenatal halothane group differed from controls. This group and the postnatal groups had excess numbers of low-scoring animals. At six months, the main effect of treatment was no longer significant, but the unusual distribution of scores was still present in the postnatal halothane group. Correlations of individual scores over the whole experiment suggested that early activity measures were significantly related to later scores. Within treatment groups, controls and postnatal nitrous oxide animals were the most consistent over time. Both agents appear to alter activity levels for periods too long to be explained by lingering presence of the drug or its metabolities.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare complication of glycogen storage disease (GSD), and several cases with a poor outcome have been reported. A 17-year-old boy, who was diagnosed with GSD at 1 year of age, complained of shortness of breath on exertion, and was diagnosed with PAH based on the echocardiographic findings. Beraprost sodium (BPS) was started, and his symptoms improved after 3 months of treatment. Eighteen months later, he experienced frequent episodes of syncope. Because increasing the dose of BPS was ineffective, he was admitted to hospital. The echocardiogram showed marked elevation of the right ventricular pressure and low cardiac output, and his symptoms deteriorated despite continuous infusion of olprinone hydrochloride. Because a single dose of sildenafil increased his cardiac output, treatment with 25 mg sildenafil twice daily was started. His symptoms gradually ameliorated, and 3 weeks later he left the hospital. Two months after starting sildenafil, the cardiac index and the serous B-type natriuretic peptide concentration had become normal. Sildenafil may be effective in patients with secondary PAH and in patients who have developed tolerance to BPS.
Sodium valproate was administered to Jcl:ICR mice in order to determine its effect on cardiovascular development. A single dose of 600 mg/kg of sodium valproate was injected intraperitoneally on gestational days 6, 7, 8, or 9. In same animals, a single dose of 300, 400, 500, or 700 mg/kg was injected on gestational day 7. On day 18 of gestation, dams were laparotomized to observe number of live, dead and resorbed fetuses. In addition, live fetuses were examined for cardiovascular abnormalities. Although cardiovascular abnormalities were noted in 3% of live fetuses and in 26% of litters in the group treated on day 6 (600 mg/kg), there was no significant difference from the control group, suggests that there may have been a biologically significant increase, although not a statistically significant increase. Cardiovascular abnormalities were found in 30%, 11%, and 8% of live fetuses in the groups treated with 600 mg/kg on days 7, 8, and 9, respectively. These represented a statistically significant increase in effects as opposed to the control groups. Among the varying dosages administered on day 7 of gestation, cardiovascular abnormalities occurred in 2%, 6%, 16%, and 36% of live fetuses in groups treated with 300, 400, 500, and 700 mg/kg, respectively, showing a significant dose-dependent increase. These cardiovascular abnormalities observed were divided into the following groups: ventricular septal defect, endocardial cushion defect, transposition of the great arteries, double outlet right ventricle, tricuspid atresia, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Maternal death did not occur at any treatment level.
A parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled and randomized study in a single center was done with ketoprofen 2.5% gel to treat acute soft tissue injuries. Patients applied the gel twice a day for seven days, corresponding to 250 mg of ketoprofen per day. Assessments were made on the third and seventh day by VAS, subjective evaluation and pain threshold algometry. The study group consisted of 29 patients and the control group 27 patients. Pain at rest was significantly relieved in the ketoprofen group, whereas in the placebo group the difference was not significant. In terms of side-effects, no difference between the groups was noticed. In both groups, local dermal irritation was found. Our results suggested that ketoprofen 2.5% gel was safe and superior to placebo in the treatment of soft tissue injuries.
Although colorectal cancer has the third highest cancer mortality rate, the treatment remains far from optimized with patients showing variable responses to standard treatment. Molecular differences in pharmacologically relevant genes may contribute to the variability in response. This study used Taqman PCR to investigate the expression of 24 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pathway genes in colorectal cancer using paired nontumor and tumor sample from 52 patients with Dukes' C colon cancer. In comparing tumor versus nonmalignant tissue, 14 of the 24 genes showed significant variation in gene expression. For 11 of these same genes (FPGS, DHFR, GGH, NME1, NME2, RRM2, UMPH2, UNG, UMPS, TP53, and TK1), a significant proportion of the patients showed an over expression of the particular gene in tumor tissue with a tumor-to-nonmalignant (T/N) ratio >1.2, whereas one gene (DPYD) showed the converse with a large number of patients showing a lower expression in the tumor tissue (T/N < 0.8). Multiple gene correlations for the genes of the 5-FU pathway were found with the Spearman rank correlation of >0.6 (all P > 0.001), suggesting possible coregulation mechanisms. Hierarchical clustering analysis created at least three groups of genes, which were consistent with groupings by the other statistical methods. Additionally, the hierarchical clustering showed two distinct groups of patients based on their gene expression. These variations in gene expression could provide valuable insights for optimizing treatment selection for patients with colorectal cancer.
To compare the efficacy in preventing hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence of lamivudine vs. lamivudine plus hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) after a short course of HBIg and lamivudine in liver transplanted chronic hepatitis B patients.
Forty-six patients with HBV cirrhosis received lamivudine before liver transplantation and were then randomized to receive lamivudine plus HBIg for 1 month followed by lamivudine or both drugs for 17 months.
Thirty-two patients were transplanted and 29 were randomized to receive combination therapy (15 cases) or lamivudine monotherapy (14 cases). HBV DNA was undetectable in all cases (17 induced by lamivudine therapy) at the time of liver transplantation. After 18 months of follow-up, all patients survived without HBV recurrence: hepatitis Bs antigen and HBV DNA were negative; however, HBV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in four cases (three with HBIg plus lamivudine and one with lamivudine). Alanine aminotransferase levels were normal except in six cases (one HCV and two HDV coinfections). There were no drug-related adverse events.
Lamivudine monotherapy after a short course of lamivudine and HBIg is equally as efficacious in preventing HBV recurrence as HBIg plus lamivudine during the first 18 months after liver transplantation. This strategy is more economic and convenient to administer than long-term HBIg plus lamivudine.
Lamivudine is effective in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B, but its role in interferon nonresponders has not been described. We assessed lamivudine treatment, with or without added interferon, in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B who had failed interferon therapy previously.
Patients were randomized to lamivudine (100 mg) or placebo for 52 weeks or to a 24-week regimen of lamivudine plus interferon. Primary treatment comparisons were at week 52, with a 16-week posttreatment follow-up period. Measurements included histology (primary endpoint), HBeAg response, normalization of alanine aminotransferase, reduction of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and safety.
Among 238 patients, histologic response was significantly more common in patients treated with lamivudine (52 versus placebo 25%, P=0.002) or the combination regimen (32%, P=0.01). HBeAg loss was also more common with lamivudine (33 versus 13 versus 21%), as were virologic and alanine aminotransferase responses. Among 28 subjects with HBeAg loss/seroconversion, 71% had durable responses 16 weeks posttreatment.
Lamivudine for 52 weeks is as effective in interferon nonresponders as in previously reported treatment-naive patients; however, a combination of lamivudine for 24 weeks and interferon for 16 weeks was not effective in this population.
After bolus doses of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, the adductor pollicis recovers from paralysis more slowly than the diaphragm and the laryngeal adductors, suggesting that the adductor pollicis is more sensitive than the respiratory muscles to effects of those drugs. In contrast, during onset, the respiratory muscles are paralyzed more rapidly than the adductor pollicis, suggesting that the respiratory muscles are more sensitive than the adductor pollicis. To reconcile these apparently conflicting findings, we determined vecuronium's pharmacokinetics and its pharmacodynamics at both the adductor pollicis and the laryngeal adductors.
Six volunteers were studied on two occasions during anesthesia with propofol. Mechanical responses to train-of-four stimulation were measured at the adductor pollicis and at the laryngeal adductors. Vecuronium (15-60 micrograms/kg) was given and arterial plasma samples were obtained from 0.5-60 min. Vecuronium doses differed by twofold on the two occasions. A pharmacokinetic model accounting for the presence and potency of vecuronium's 3-desacetyl metabolite and a sigmoid e-max pharmacodynamic model were fit to the resulting plasma concentration and effect (adductor pollicis and laryngeal adductors) data to determine relative sensitivities and rates of equilibration between plasma and effect site concentrations.
The steady-state plasma concentration depressing laryngeal adductor twitch tension by 50% was approximately 1.5 times larger than that for the adductor pollicis. The equilibration rate constant between plasma and laryngeal adductor concentrations was about 1.5 faster than that between plasma and adductor pollicis concentrations. The Hill factor (gamma) that describes the steepness of the laryngeal adductor concentration-effect relation was approximately 0.6 times that of the adductor pollicis.
More rapid equilibration between plasma and laryngeal adductor vecuronium concentrations explains why onset is more rapid at the laryngeal adductors than at the adductor pollicis. During recovery, both rapid equilibration and lesser sensitivity of the laryngeal adductors contribute to earlier recovery.
The effects of lidocaine (5 or 10 mg/kg bolus + 2.5 mg/kg/h) on arrhythmias and changes in myocardial and plasma catecholamines (CAs) after left coronary artery occlusion were investigated in anesthetized rats. Myocardial intraneuronal CAs were assessed histofluorimetrically and CA concentrations were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both doses of lidocaine caused reductions in heart rate and blood pressure. The higher dose significantly reduced the number of ischemia-induced ventricular extrasystoles from 425 +/- 123 to 25 +/- 12 in the first 60 min of ischemia and abolished ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. In the myocardium of untreated animals, the area of fluorescing adrenergic neurons (as percentage of total field area) was 0.42 +/- 0.02% after 60 min of ischemia as compared with 1.38 +/- 0.17% in sham-operated animals. Lidocaine pretreatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of this ischemia-induced CA release from adrenergic neurons (0.96 +/- 0.06 and 1.30 +/- 0.05% for the lower and higher dose, respectively). Tissue and plasma CA concentrations were not significantly affected by lidocaine pretreatment and by coronary occlusion. It is concluded that lidocaine inhibits CA release from sympathetic nerve endings in the ischemic myocardium by its endoanesthetic and membrane-stabilizing properties. The reduction in CA release may also contribute to its antiarrhythmic effects.
