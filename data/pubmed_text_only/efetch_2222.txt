Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were demonstrated to inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and this was particularly evident in the increase in adrenal androgen levels during anti-TNF therapy. This study investigated the influence on steroidogenesis of an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-neutralizing strategy using IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies (referred to as MRA).
In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study over 12 weeks in 29 patients with RA being treated with prednisolone, 13 of whom received placebo and 16 of whom received 8 mg MRA/kg body weight, the effects of MRA on serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (ASD), estrone, and 17beta-estradiol, as well as their respective molar ratios, were determined.
MRA therapy markedly improved clinical signs of inflammation (the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, swollen joint score, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints). Serum levels of ACTH and cortisol and the molar ratio of cortisol to ACTH did not change. Although serum levels of DHEA and DHEAS remained stable during therapy, the DHEAS:DHEA molar ratio significantly decreased in treated patients (P = 0.048). Serum levels of ASD as well as the ASD:cortisol and ASD:17OHP molar ratios increased in MRA-treated patients (minimum P < 0.004). Serum levels of estrone and 17beta-estradiol did not change. but the estrone:ASD molar ratio (an indicator of aromatization) decreased during 12 weeks of MRA treatment (P = 0.001).
Neutralization of IL-6 increases secretion of biologically active adrenal androgens in relation to that of precursor hormones and estrogens. This is another important indication that proinflammatory cytokines interfere with adrenal androgen steroidogenesis in patients with RA.
Vasopeptidase inhibitors by definition inhibit both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), therefore they may exceed the effect of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension. The present study investigated the effect of the vasopeptidase inhibitor AVE7688 in comparison to the ACE inhibitor ramipril on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and endothelial function in renovascular hypertension.
Wistar-Kyoto rats with renovascular hypertension (two-kidney one-clamp-model) were randomized 2 weeks after unilateral clamping of the right renal artery for 3 weeks' oral treatment with either AVE7688 (30 mg/kg/day), ramipril (1 mg/kg/day) or placebo. SBP was measured by the tail-cuff method and endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular function was assessed in isolated preconstricted (norepinephrine 10(-7) mol/l) aortic rings as relaxation to acetylcholine (10(-10)-10(-4) mol/l) and sodium nitroprusside (10(-10)-10(-4) mol/l), respectively.
Two weeks after clamping, SBP was significantly elevated (196 +/- 16 vs. 145 +/- 8 mm Hg for sham-operated rats; p < 0.01) and further increased in placebo-treated animals to 208 +/- 19 mm Hg. Treatment with AVE7688 and ramipril had a similar blood pressure-lowering effect (119 +/- 8 and 124 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively; p < 0.01 vs. placebo). Maximum endothelium-dependent relaxation was reduced in hypertensive rats (72 +/- 6 vs. 99 +/- 7% in control rats; p < 0.05). Endothelium-dependent relaxation was restored by AVE7688 (101 +/- 6%) and ramipril (94 +/- 8%), respectively, whereas endothelium-independent relaxation was comparable in all groups.
In renovascular hypertension the vasopeptidase inhibitor AVE7688 exhibited similar blood pressure-lowering and endothelial protective properties as compared to the ACE inhibitor ramipril. Therefore, in high renin models of hypertension, vasopeptidase inhibition may be considered an alternative treatment option to ACE inhibition.
Beginning in the 1980s, methotrexate has been used successfully to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The magnitude and severity of short- and long-term methotrexate toxicity, however, have not been adequately investigated. Our study was performed to determine the prevalence of hepatotoxicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving long-term methotrexate therapy.
We conducted a retrospective, computer-assisted review of all Duke University Medical Center patients undergoing liver biopsy for methotrexate monitoring from January 1979 to January 1988. A total of 538 biopsies were performed in 399 patients, 259 of whom had inflammatory arthritis (210 with rheumatoid arthritis, 47 with psoriatic arthritis, and two with seronegative spondyloarthropathy).
No evidence of cirrhosis was defined in the cohort with rheumatoid arthritis; however, six patients with rheumatoid arthritis had histologic changes of fibrotic liver disease (prevalence of 2.9 percent in the group with rheumatoid arthritis) while taking methotrexate. Five of the six patients were obese and three had glucose intolerance or overt diabetes mellitus, and one person admitted to alcohol usage. Only one patient with fibrotic liver disease had elevated liver function test results, and no person showed a declining serum albumin level at the time of biopsy. Sixty-one patients with rheumatoid arthritis underwent multiple samplings (44 with two, 13 with three, and four with four biopsies). Fourteen of these patients showed progressive hepatic disease, whereas four patients improved.
Although the prevalence of methotrexate hepatotoxicity in this large cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was low, a small but definite risk of hepatic fibrosis, not predictable by laboratory screening, still exists.
Postoperative emetic symptoms (nausea, retching, and vomiting) are common following total joint replacement, with an incidence as high as 83% when no prophylactic antiemetic is provided. However, most antiemetics currently used in Japan, such as antihistamines (eg, hydroxyzine), butyrophenones (eg, droperidol), and dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), have been associated with adverse effects (AEs), such as excessive sedation, hypotension, dry mouth, dysphoria, hallucinations, and extrapyramidal symptoms.
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of 3 doses of intravenous dexamethasone monotherapy versus vehicle in preventing emetic symptoms after total knee replacement performed under combined general and epidural anesthesia.
This prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was conducted at the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Tsukuba Institute of Clinical Medicine, Tsukuba, Japan. Adult Japanese patients scheduled to undergo total knee replacement were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: dexamethasone 4, 8, or 16 mg, or vehicle (control). Patients received combination anesthesia with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide in pure oxygen (general) and lidocaine (epidural). Study drugs were administered intravenously after the completion of surgery. An investigator blinded to treatment assignment monitored patients for emetic symptoms for 24 hours after the patient awoke. Patients rated their satisfaction with the study drug using a linear, 11-point scale (0 = complete satisfaction to 10 = complete dissatisfaction). Tolerability was assessed by the study investigator using spontaneous reporting and patient interview.
A total of 80 patients were enrolled (58 women, 22 men; mean [SD] age, 59 [10] years; mean [SD] height, 154 [7] cm; mean [SD] body weight, 55 [7] kg; 20 patients per treatment group). The demographic, clinical, and surgical data were comparable between the 4 treatment groups. The rates of emesis-free patients were 35% (7 patients), 70% (14), and 75% (15) with dexamethasone 4, 8, and 16 mg, respectively, compared with 30% (6) with vehicle (P = NS, 0.013, and 0.005, respectively). Median (range) patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the groups receiving dexamethasone 8 and 16 mg (both, 0.0 [0-9]) compared with controls (6.0 [0-10]) (P = 0.013 and 0.008, respectively). This effect was not found with the 4-mg dose. No clinically serious AEs attributed to the study drug were observed in any of the 4 treatment groups.
In this study of a small, select group of adult Japanese patients undergoing total knee replacement, the rates of emesis-free patients were higher with dexamethasone 8 and 16 mg compared with vehicle 24 hours after anesthesia induction. This effect was not found with the 4-mg dose. All treatments were well tolerated.
This naturalistic open label follow-up study had three objectives: 1) To observe the course of illness in Panic Disorder patients receiving long-term versus intermediate-term paroxetine treatment, 2) To compare the relapse rates and side-effect profile after long-term paroxetine treatment between patients with Panic Disorder and Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, 3) To observe paroxetine's tolerability over a 24 month period.
143 patients with panic disorder (PD), with or without agoraphobia, successfully finished a short-term (ie 12 week) trial of paroxetine treatment. All patients then continued to receive paroxetine maintenance therapy for a total of 12 months. At the end of this period, 72 of the patients chose to discontinue paroxetine pharmacotherapy and agreed to be monitored throughout a one year discontinuation follow-up phase. The remaining 71 patients continued on paroxetine for an additional 12 months and then were monitored, as in the first group, for another year while medication-free. The primary limitation of our study is that the subgroups of patients receiving 12 versus 24 months of maintenance paroxetine therapy were selected according to individual patient preference and therefore were not assigned in a randomized manner.
Only 21 of 143 patients (14%) relapsed during the one year medication discontinuation follow-up phase. There were no significant differences in relapse rates between the patients who received intermediate-term (up to 12 months) paroxetine and those who chose the long-term course (24 month paroxetine treatment). 43 patients (30.1%) reported sexual dysfunction. The patients exhibited an average weight gain of 5.06 kg. All patients who eventually relapsed demonstrated significantly greater weight increase (7.3 kg) during the treatment phase.
The extension of paroxetine maintenance treatment from 12 to 24 months did not seem to further decrease the risk of relapse after medication discontinuation. Twenty-four month paroxetine treatment is accompanied by sexual side effects and weight gain similar to those observed in twelve month treatment.
A gene that affects susceptibility to cortisone-induced cleft palate maps between H-2S and H-2D on mouse chromosome 17. Congenic mouse strains that differ at this locus, designated Cps-1 (cleft palate susceptibility-1), have been tested for the presence of several closely linked markers. All data obtained so far are consistent with a gene order of H-2S-Cps-1-BAT-5-BAT-2-TNF-H-2D. The Cps-1 gene does not appear to affect the level of glucocorticoid receptors or the susceptibility of mice to phenytoin-induced cleft palate.
In a naloxone-reversible, dose-dependent manner, morphine (10-50 mg/kg i.p.) protected against seizures induced by maximal electroshock and increased the incidence and severity of seizures induced by bicuculline, in rats. Morphine also potentiated seizures induced by isoniazid and by picrotoxin. Thus, opiate activity influences the expression of seizures in contrasting ways depending upon the mode of seizure induction. Since morphine consistently potentiated seizures induced by interference with GABA transmission, it appears that GABAergic systems may be of particular significance for the elucidation of the varied effects of morphine on seizure susceptibility.
In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given as a 3-hour infusion in combination with carboplatin administered every 21 days to women with advanced ovarian cancer, paclitaxel doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg/m2; level 2, 160 mg/m2; level 3, 185 mg/m2; and level 4,210 mg/m2. The fixed dose of carboplatin at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 using the Calvert formula. In levels 5 and 6 the carboplatin dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7.5, respectively, combined with a fixed paclitaxel dose of 185 mg/m2. To date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study. The dose-limiting toxicity of the combination was myelosuppression (leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia). Neurotoxicity was largely moderate. So far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight (57%) showed objective (complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients. No patient had disease progression. We conclude that the combination of paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour infusion followed immediately by a 1-hour infusion of carboplatin at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21-day schedule in the outpatient setting. The recommended dose for phase III studies is paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6.
A patient with cystinuria who was treated with large doses of D-penicillamine for 19 years developed skin abnormalities resembling those seen in pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Biochemical and histological examination of the dermis showed that the collagen content, the ratio of the major genetic forms of collagen and the distribution of collagen types was normal. Light microscopy demonstrated the presence of vastly increased amounts of elastin in the dermis, and the individual elastin fibres were shown by electron microscopy to be abnormal; chemical analysis showed the elastin to be poorly cross-linked. Some of the collagen also appeared structurally abnormal, and biochemically resembled that seen in the dermis of a young child with respect to cross-linking and hexosyl-lysine content. The therapy led to an increased deposition of collagen and elastin fibres which appeared abnormal, and resulted in an increase in total skin surface area. These data indicate that D-penicillamine was not fully effective in inhibiting collagen and elastin cross-linking, and appeared to prevent or inhibit the natural maturation process of the collagen.
The commercially available formulation of amlodipine is conjugated with besylate salt to increase water solubility. Recently, a new amlodipine salt formulation has been developed in which the free base of amlodipine is conjugated with a chemically different salt, adipate.
The goal of this study was to compare the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of amlodipine adipate with those of amlodipine besylate in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
This was a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, parallel-group study in which patients received 8 weeks of treatment with either amlodipine adipate or amlodipine besylate. The primary efficacy variable was noninferiority of the difference in mean changes from baseline in trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary efficacy variables included mean changes in DBP, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and response rate (defined as the proportion of patients whose DBP was <90 mm Hg or whose DBP had decreased from baseline by > or =10 mm Hg). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was also assessed.
Two hundred eleven patients were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine adipate (n = 106) or amlodipine besylate (n = 105). Study patients were primarily female (54.5%), with a mean (SD) age of 52.2 (9.6) years and a mean body weight of 67.1 (10.2) kg; there were no between-group differences in demographic profiles. After 4 weeks of randomized treatment, 58 (27.5%) patients (29 [27.4%] amlodipine adipate, 29 [27.6%] amlodipine besylate) had not achieved a mean DBP <90 mm Hg, and their dose was doubled. Mean DBP changes at 8 weeks were -15.2 (7.3) mm Hg in the amlodipine adipate group and -14.2 (7.4) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group (P = NS). Because the 95% CI for the difference in mean DBP changes between groups (-0.53 to 2.55) was within the prespecified lower limit (-4 mm Hg), amlodipine adipate was considered noninferior to amlodipine besylate. Mean SBP changes were -24.9 (12.1) mm Hg in the amlodipine adipate group and -22.0 (14.7) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group (P = NS). The response rates were 92.0% for amlodipine adipate and 95.4% for amlodipine besylate (P = NS). The overall incidence of clinical AEs was 20.8% in the amlodipine adipate group and 25.7% in the amlodipine besylate group (P = NS). Drug-related clinical AEs occurred in 5.7% and 12.4% of patients in the respective treatment groups (P = NS). Serum uric acid levels decreased significantly from base-line in both groups (P < 0.001).
Eight weeks of treatment with amlodipine adipate produced significant reductions from baseline in blood pressure in these patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The efficacy of amlodipine adipate was not inferior to that of amlodipine besylate. Tolerability was comparable between the 2 treatment groups.
Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors are promising antiangiogenic agents in several preclinical models. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in vitro and angiogenesis and growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo, focusing on putative differences between COX-2-negative and COX-2-positive tumors. VEGF production and angiogenesis in vitro were determined by ELISA and endothelial cell migration assay. To determine whether the effect of COX-2 inhibitors was mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), we used a dominant-negative PPAR-gamma and a pharmacologic inhibitor. In vitro findings were validated in a pancreatic cancer animal model. Microvessel density was assessed by CD31 immunostaining. Intratumoral prostaglandin and VEGF levels were measured by mass spectroscopy and ELISA. Selective COX-2 inhibitors had a concentration-dependent effect on VEGF production in vitro. Higher concentrations increased VEGF levels and stimulated angiogenesis by activating PPAR-gamma. In vivo, nimesulide increased VEGF production by cancer cells in COX-2-positive and COX-2-negative pancreatic tumors. In COX-2-negative pancreatic cancer, this effect was associated with an increase in angiogenesis and growth. In COX-2-positive pancreatic cancer, the nimesulide-induced increase of VEGF production by the cancer cells was offset by a decrease in VEGF production by the nonmalignant cell types leading to reduced tumor angiogenesis and growth. Selective COX-2 inhibitors had opposite effects on growth and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer depending on COX-2 expression. These findings imply that assessing the COX-2 profile of the pancreatic tumor is mandatory before initiating therapy with a selective COX-2 inhibitor.
Danazol is a widely used drug that causes few major adverse reactions, most of which are rapidly reversible upon cessation of therapy. While the list of pharmacologic agents capable of causing hearing loss continues to grow, no published reports have ever implicated danazol. We treated a patient for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss due to danazol therapy. The hearing loss resolved promptly after withdrawal of the medication.
To report the case of a patient who developed marked anxiety associated with episodes of panic attacks after starting rabeprazole therapy.
An otherwise healthy 55-year-old woman was prescribed rabeprazole 20 mg/day administered in the morning for persistent symptoms of dyspepsia. Ten days later, she presented with a 7 day history of marked anxiety associated with panic attacks, night terror (pavor nocturnus), episodic mental confusion, and attention deficit. Within 2 days of discontinuing rabeprazole, the patient recovered completely from the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Subsequent esomeprazole therapy did not cause psychiatric symptoms.
Rabeprazole-induced hypergastrinemia may have played a role in this neuropsychiatric adverse reaction. Several lines of evidence have indicated that gastrin-releasing peptide, whose release is mediated by proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-induced secretion of gastrin, is involved in regulating aspects of behavior that might be altered in disorders such as anxiety, depression, and dementia. The fact that rabeprazole has the highest capacity of inducing gastrin increase compared with other PPIs might explain why our patient's panic symptoms disappeared after switching to esomeprazole. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, rabeprazole was the probable cause of the adverse reaction.
Specific studies are needed to investigate the potential role of PPI-induced hypergastrinemia in neuropsychiatric adverse reactions.
Contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an increasing cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury and leads to a significant increase in mortality. There is uncertainty whether the use of iso-osmolar contrast media as opposed to the use of low-osmolar contrast media would be associated with a lower incidence of CIN. Therefore, we compared the nephrotoxicity of isoosmotic contrast media iodixanol with the low-osmotic contrast media iopromid in patients receiving contrast media during coronary angiography.
In this prospective double-blind study we examined 221 patients with normal renal function who received up to 1,000 ml of contrast media during coronary angiography, and compared the effect of iodixanol and iopromid on inducing contrast media nephropathy. Patients received 800 ml fluid orally before contrast media administration and 1,000 ml saline i.v. thereafter. Creatinine clearance, serum creatinine and urine-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) concentration was obtained 24 h before and 48 h after contrast media administration. Decrease of 20% of the creatinine clearance, increase of 25% of serum creatinine and increase of 20% of the urine concentration of NAG was defined as CIN.
Incidence of CIN assessed by decreased creatinine clearance was 22.2% in the iopromid group and 19.7% in the iodixanol group. CIN defined by increased serum creatinine was 6.9% in the iopromid group and 8.6% in the iodixanol group. The difference between these two groups was not significant. Subgroup analysis of the diabetic patients or the patients that received high dose of contrast media revealed no significant difference in the incidence of CIN between the two contrast media.
The iso-osmolar and the low-osmolar contrast media exhibited the same incidence of CIN in our study population. If fluid administration is sufficient, the selection of either iopromid or iodixanol has no impact on the risk of developing CIN in patients with normal renal function, even when they are diabetic or receive a high dose of more than 500 ml contrast media.
To develop a predictive genetic signature for the development of bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN).
Two thousand and sixteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 139 samples from myeloma patients treated with bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone in the VISTA phase 3 trial. Single-marker association analysis for PN onset and time/cumulative dose to PN onset using the Cox proportional hazards model and multiple covariates was performed under additive, dominant, and recessive genotypic models, followed by correction for multiplicity. Associations were also pursued in a cohort of 212 samples from patients treated with bortezomib-dexamethasone in the IFM 2005-01 phase 3 trial.
In the VISTA cohort, after Bonferroni correction, two SNPs significantly associated with time to onset of PN [CTLA4 rs4553808, false discovery rate (FDR)=0.002] and time to onset of grade of at least 2 PN (PSMB1 rs1474642, FDR=0.014). Using FDR less than 0.05 as the threshold, two additional SNPs significantly associated with time to onset of grade of at least 2 (CTSS rs12568757, FDR=0.027) or grade of at least 3 PN (GJE1 rs11974610, FDR=0.041). DYNC1I1 rs916758 significantly associated (FDR=0.012) with cumulative dose to onset of grade of at least 2 PN. These associations were generally not detected in the IFM 2005-01 cohort, although CTLA4 rs4553808 showed the same trend in association with time to onset (P=0.138). In addition, in the IFM 2005-01 cohort, TCF4 rs1261134 significantly associated with onset of any neurologic event (FDR=0.048).
Genes associated with immune function (CTLA4, CTSS), reflexive coupling within Schwann cells (GJE1), drug binding (PSMB1), and neuron function (TCF4, DYNC1I1) associated with bortezomib-induced PN in this study.
Pancreatitis secondary to organophosphate insecticide toxicity is extremely rare. The few previously reported cases have resulted from oral ingestion of these agents. We present the first reported case of acute pancreatitis occurring after cutaneous exposure to an organophosphate insecticide. Symptoms of pancreatitis persisted for 6 months, followed by total resolution. The proposed mechanisms of pancreatic injury caused by organophosphate compounds are discussed.
Because of paclitaxel's (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) high single-agent activity in non-small cell lung cancer we developed a study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and a dose suitable for outpatient phase II/III trials of paclitaxel combined with a fixed dose of carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve of 6, Calvert formula). From October 1993 to November 1994, 41 patients were entered into this trial, including six at dose level I (paclitaxel 150 mg/m2), six at dose level 2 (paclitaxel 175 mg/m2), II at dose level 3 (paclitaxel 200 mg/m2), 13 at dose level 4 (paclitaxel 225 mg/m2), and five at dose level 5 (paclitaxel 250 mg/m2). Patient characteristics included 27 men and 14 women with a median age of 64 years (age range, 46 to 81 years). The median Southwest Oncology Group performance status was I (range, 0 to 2). Nineteen patients had unresectable stage III and 22 had stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Forty-one patients and 167 treatment courses were evaluable for toxicity. Hematologic toxicity was generally mild to moderate, not related to paclitaxel dose, and never dose limiting. Thrombocytopenia was remarkably mild, with only one episode of grade 3 toxicity (no grade 4). Arthralgias and cumulative sensory neuropathy were dose related and dose limiting. The maximum tolerated dose was defined at the 250 mg/m2 dose level with three of five patients achieving grade 3 (severe toxicity. The 225 mg/m2 dose level appears to be well tolerated, but accrual at this dose level is ongoing. This appears to be a highly active regimen, with objective responses in 20 (two complete responses and 18 partial responses) of 32 patients with objectively measurable disease for an overall response rate of 62.5%.
From March 1993 to May 1994, 32 chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer entered a phase I/II study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the activity of the paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ)/cisplatin combination. The 21 men and 11 women had a median age of 59 years (range, 25 to 72 years) and a median performance status of 1 (range, 0 to 2). Histologic types were adenocarcinoma (13 cases), squamous cell carcinoma (10), and large cell carcinoma (nine). Nine patients had stage IIIB disease and 23 had stage IV disease. The first four dose levels of paclitaxel were 135, 175, 200, and 225 mg/m2 given with a fixed cisplatin dose of 100 mg/m2; at level 5, paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 was again given, and the cisplatin dose was increased to 120 mg/m2. Cycles were given every 3 weeks. Paclitaxel was administered as a 3-hour infusion followed by cisplatin, with standard premedication and hyperhydration. The maximum tolerated dose for the first cycle was not reached. Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 24% and 16% of cycles (two cases with fever), respectively. Grades 2 and 3 peripheral axonal neurotoxicity occurred in two and 16 patients, respectively; the neurotoxicity appeared to be dose dependent and cumulative after a median total paclitaxel dose of 1,300 mg/m2. Of the 29 patients evaluable for efficacy, 11 (38%) had a partial response; efficacy was superior at paclitaxel doses of at least 200 mg/m2, with eight (47%) of 17 evaluable patients responding at these levels. In conclusion, at these doses of paclitaxel and cisplatin, the dose-limiting neurologic toxicity is dose dependent and cumulative after a total paclitaxel dose of approximately 1,300 mg/m2. This combination is highly active, with a total objective response rate of 38% and an objective response rate of 47% at paclitaxel doses of 200 mg/m2 or higher. Further evaluation is warranted.
Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma. Two phase II trials of 24-hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported response rates of 21% and 24%. Leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62.5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia. We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. The 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2. Most patients (72.4%) had stage IV NSCLC. Paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication. Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%). Hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2. Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy. Similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia/arthralgia was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4. Nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4. Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. Further phase II studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against NSCLC are indicated, and phase III studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.
Twenty-one patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blastic transformation underwent 22 remission induction attempts with high-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), administered as a two-hour infusion of 3 g/m2 for six to 12 doses. Ara-C doses were administered every 12 hours in 15 patients and every six to ten hours in six patients. Median patient age was 35 years (range, 20 to 62). The median duration of benign phase was 25 months (range, 0 to 167). Morphology of blast crisis blast cells was myeloid in 15 patients and lymphoid in six. Five patients achieved complete remission (CR), three had partial remission (PR), and one had hematologic improvement, for an overall response rate of 41%. Median remission duration was 2.5 months (range, 0.5 to 6 months). Survival duration was 6 months for responding patients and 1.5 months for those with resistant disease. The response rate was similar for patients with myeloid and lymphoid blast crisis (31% v 50%, respectively). The response rate was significantly higher for patients whose benign phase was less than 1 year (75% v 21%, P = .05) and who had prolonged marrow aplasia after ara-C (86% v 27%, P = .05). Myelosuppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity, and cerebellar toxicity occurred in two patients. Intracellular ara-C 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) levels were similar in blood and bone marrow leukemic cells and were slightly greater in the cells of responding patients compared to those with resistant disease. We conclude that high-dose ara-C is an effective regimen for CML blast crisis, resulting in a substantial response rate but modest remission duration. Its combination with other agents may further improve the prognosis of patients with this resistant disease.
Cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) are responsible for the metabolism of arachidonic acid into inflammatory metabolites, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, respectively. The upregulation of these enzymes in the central nervous system has been demonstrated to be responsible for the increased neuronal vulnerability to degeneration. Kainic acid, a glutamate receptor agonist and responsible for neuronal excitotoxicity and oxidative damage via different mechanisms, is capable of stimulating mRNA of both COX-2 and 5-LOX in the brain. The present study was designed to study the effects of COX inhibitors (indomethacin, nimesulide, rofecoxib) and a 5-LOX inhibitor (acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid; AKBA) and the combination of these inhibitors (dual inhibition) on kainic acid induced excitotoxicity and oxidative and nitrosative damage in mice. The results from the present study indicated that AKBA, indomethacin, and nimesulide per se did not produce any change in the behavioural parameters after kainic acid administration; however, rofecoxib per seproduced a significant increase in the latency of clonic (seizure-like) movement and a decrease in mortality rate as compared with kainic acid treated animals. In combination studies AKBA, rofecoxib, and nimesulide produced a more pronounced effect than either of these drugs alone. Further, the effect of AKBA combined with rofecoxib was significantly more marked when compared with AKBA combined with nimesulide. Besides this, identical results were found for the effect of these agents and their combination against oxidative damage induced by kainic acid. These findings indicate the potential role of COX-2 inhibitors and also their combination with the 5-LOX inhibitor in kainic acid induced excitotoxicity and oxidative damage by virtue of their antioxidant effect and suggest the need for the development of dual inhibitors for the treatment of neuronal excitotoxicity.
In postoperative patients using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) to administer i.v. doses of morphine sulfate, respiratory rates and subjective rankings of pain, sedation, and liking for the drug were correlated with plasma morphine concentrations. In 12 patients selected before surgery, the initial morphine sulfate dose of 0.6 mg/sq m was increased or decreased as needed. Every two hours, cumulative morphine sulfate dose, respiratory rate, and sedation were recorded by the nurse, along with the patient's evaluation of pain and liking for the drug. Plasma was collected in the morning and evening during PCA therapy for morphine analysis. Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance. Dosing rates and rankings of pain, sedation, and liking decreased as a function of time postoperatively, but respiratory rates did not. Sedation and respiratory rates were independent of morphine concentration. Liking of the drug increased directly with plasma morphine concentration but decreased with time. A high level of pain was directly related to morphine use. For all significant relationships, there was high interpatient variability, with the exception of changes in pain rankings induced by morphine. Patients defined a minimum effective plasma morphine concentration of 20-40 ng/mL. The maximum plasma morphine concentration achieved by self-administration was 82 ng/mL. These postoperative patients used patient-controlled analgesia to deliver morphine sulfate i.v. for pain relief, not for euphoria, and did not exhibit sedation or respiratory depression. Morphine was consistently effective at plasma concentrations of 40 ng/mL or greater.
