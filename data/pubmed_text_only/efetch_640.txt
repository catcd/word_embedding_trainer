In the present investigation, we have used adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity as biochemical test of toxic action of lindane that was explained by lipid peroxidation model. Study was also undertaken to ascertain the potential protective role of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and vitamin E on the same parameters. Highly acute dose of lindane, i.e., 40 mg/kg bw for 18 h exposure, was used for creating lesions in brain. Lipid peroxidation was measured in terms of glutathione peroxidase and thio barbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS). Various brain regions under investigation were cerebellum and pons-medulla oblongata. Healthy, male, Swiss mice (7-8 weeks old) were allocated into four groups. First group was control, second group was treated with lindane, third group was treated purely with antioxidants, and fourth group received both antioxidants and lindane treatment. Results revealed the significant difference (at 1% and 5% in all groups) in all studied parameters from control. Increased TBARS level in second group suggests that lindane enhances the production of free radicals in studied brain regions. Antioxidants under test are efficient remedy for neurotoxicity caused by lindane. We conclude that lindane manifests toxic effects on brain ATPase and enhances lipid peroxidation. ALA and vitamin E in combination may provide protection against lindane-induced acute toxicity.
Resveratrol has been shown to exert anti-atherosclerotic effects. 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) play key roles in foam cell formation, which is considered as the initiation of atherosclerosis. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether resveratrol inhibits foam cell formation by regulating lipid accumulation and inflammation. For this purpose, THP-1 cells were treated with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce their differentiation into macrophages. The macrophages were then pre-treated with 2.5 µM resveratrol and subsequently with serum-free (SF) medium alone or SF medium containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL; 50 µg/ml) for 24 h to detect foam cell formation. To detect the expression of lipid accumulation-related proteins, the macrophages were treated with resveratrol. For the detection MCP-1 expression, the macrophages were treated with LPS and resveratrol, or with resveratrol alone. We incubated the THP-1-derived macrophages in resveratrol (2.5 µM) for 6 h in the presence or absence of 30 µM compound C for 4 h to detect the influence of compound C on the effects of resveratrol. The foam cells were examined using Red O staining. Gene expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR, western blot analysis and ELISA; lipid analysis was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results revealed that resveratrol effectively suppressed foam cell formation induced by LPS. Resveratrol also suppressed lipid accumulation and downregulated the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and PPARα, but had no effect on the expression of PPARβ/δ. Resveratrol also upregulated the expression of AMPK and Silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1). However, the effects of resveratrol on SIRT1, PPARγ and PPARα expression and lipid accumulation were reversed when the cells were pre-treated with compound C. Resveratrol downregulated the mRNA expression of MCP-1 in a dose-dependent manner and LPS upregulate its expression in a time-dependent manner. MCP-1 expression induced by LPS was inhibited by resveratrol at both the transcriptional and translational level. These data suggest that resveratrol inhibits foam cell formation by regulating the expression of MCP-1 and activating the AMPK-SIRT1-PPAR signaling pathway; thus, resveratrol may be a novel therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis.
Classic antimalarial drugs, particularly quinine and its derivatives, are well known for their potential pro-arrhythmic effects. Recently developed synthetic antimalarials are widely used among travelers for prophylaxis. Nevertheless, their safety is open to question, especially for travelers under common cardiovascular drug therapy. We report the case of a patient admitted for symptomatic high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, caused by combined therapy with a common malaria prophylactic drug--mefloquine--and a beta-blocker prescribed for a symptomatic arrhythmia. Withdrawal of the beta-blocker led to disappearance of the AV block despite continuation of the malaria prophylaxis. Mefloquine drug interactions are briefly described, particularly in terms of the caution needed in travelers already under beta-blocker therapy in whom antimalarial drug prophylaxis is recommended.
Although increases in dopamine transmission in the brain are clearly involved in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking, the role of nucleus accumbens dopamine in cocaine priming-induced reinstatement remains controversial. The goal of these experiments was to evaluate the relative contributions of D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens core and shell in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour. Initially, rats were trained to press a lever for cocaine (0.25 mg, i.v.) using a fixed-ratio 5 (FR5) schedule of reinforcement. Responding was then extinguished by substituting saline for cocaine. During the reinstatement phase, subtype-specific dopamine receptor agonists were microinjected into the nucleus accumbens core or medial shell in order to assess their ability to induce cocaine seeking. Administration of the D1/D5 dopamine receptor agonist SKF-81297 (1.0 microg) into the nucleus accumbens shell, but not core, reinstated drug-seeking behaviour. Similarly, microinjection of quinpirole (3.0 microg), a D2/D3 dopamine receptor agonist, into the nucleus accumbens shell and not core reinstated drug-seeking behaviour. In contrast, administration of the D3- or D4-preferring dopamine receptor agonists PD 128,907 (1.5 and 3.0 microg) and PD 168,077 (0.3 and 3.0 microg), respectively, did not promote reinstatement when administered into either the core or the shell. Taken together, these results indicate that activation of D1/D5 or D2 dopamine receptors, in the limbic shell subregion of the nucleus accumbens but not the basal ganglia-orientated accumbens core, promotes the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour.
Many patients require temporary inotropic support after cardiac surgery, and dobutamine is one of the commonly used drugs for this purpose. However, dobutamine infusion is frequently associated with unwanted sinus tachycardia. Selective sinus node electrical vagal stimulation through a discrete epicardial ganglionic plexus (fat pad) approach can achieve sinus rate slowing. Because sinus node fat pad vagal stimulation (SNFP-VS) can easily be applied during or after cardiac surgery, we hypothesized that combining selective SNFP-VS with dobutamine could produce desired hemodynamic improvement while avoiding sinus tachycardia in patients when inotropic drug support is needed.
This exploratory experimental study was performed in 7 open-chest dogs. Dobutamine (2.5 to 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) was infused at a rate producing at least 30% increase in sinus rate and cardiac output. Then electrical SNFP-VS was applied in the epicardial ganglionic plexus located at the right pulmonary vein-atrial junction, to slow the sinus rate back to control level. Hemodynamic data during control, with steady-state dobutamine infusion, and with dobutamine plus SNFP-VS were collected and compared.
Dobutamine significantly increased heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, peak left ventricular systolic pressure, positive and negative maximal derivatives of left ventricular pressure, and cardiac output. Combining SNFP-VS with dobutamine eliminated sinus rate increase while preserving all major hemodynamic benefits. Selective SNFP-VS itself had no direct effect on cardiac contractility during atrial pacing.
Combining SNFP-VS with dobutamine could achieve hemodynamic improvement while avoiding sinus tachycardia in this dog model, suggesting that similar strategy may also be applied in patients.
Congenital hydronephrosis is a serious disease occurring among infants and children. Besides the intrinsic genetic factors, in utero exposure to a xenobiotic, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), has been suggested to induce hydronephrosis in rodents owing to anatomical obstruction in the ureter. Here, we report that hydronephrosis induced in mouse pups exposed lactationally to TCDD is not associated with anatomical obstruction, but with abnormal alterations in the subepithelial mesenchyma of the ureter. In the kidneys of these pups, the expressions of a battery of inflammatory cytokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-1beta were up-regulated as early as postnatal day (PND) 7. The amounts of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA and protein as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) were conspicuously up-regulated in an arylhydrocarbon-receptor-dependent manner in the TCDD-induced hydronephrotic kidney, with a subsequent down-regulation of the gene expressions of Na+ and K+ transporters, NKCC2 and ROMK. Daily administration of a COX-2 selective inhibitor to newborns until PND 7 completely abrogated the TCDD-induced PGE(2) synthesis and gene expressions of inflammatory cytokines and electrolyte transporters, and eventually prevented the onset of hydronephrosis. These findings suggest an essential role of COX-2 in mediating the TCDD action of inducing hydronephrosis through the functional impairment rather than the anatomical blockade of the ureter.
Resveratrol, a constituent of grapes and other foods, has been reported to be a potential cancer chemopreventive agent. Our previous study showed that the antitumor activity of resveratrol occurs through mitogen-activated protein kinases-mediated p53 activation and induction of apoptosis. To develop more effective agents with fewer side effects for the chemoprevention of cancer, we investigated the effect of resveratrol and its structurally related derivatives on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell transformation. Our results provided the first evidence that one of the resveratrol derivatives exerted a more potent inhibitory effect than resveratrol on EGF-induced cell transformation, but had less cytotoxic effects on normal nontransformed cells. Compared to resveratrol, this compound also caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, but did not induce p53 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, this compound, but not resveratrol, markedly inhibited EGF-induced phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) and Akt activation. Collectively, these data suggested that the higher antitumor effect of the compound compared to resveratrol, may act through a different mechanism by mainly targeting PI-3K/Akt signaling pathways.
Acute kidney injury is an unfortunate complication of acyclovir therapy secondary to crystal-induced nephropathy. It is characterized by a decrease in renal function that develops within 24-48 hours of acyclovir administration indicated by a rapid rise in the serum creatinine. Failure to quickly realize this as an etiology of acute kidney injury can lead to excessive morbidity to the patient. The case described in this vignette is an example of the clinical manifestation of acyclovir crystal obstructive nephrotoxicity. We will briefly discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention, and management of patients that present with acyclovir nephrotoxicity.
A patient with a potassium wasting nephropathy secondary to chemotherapy simulating Bartter's syndrome is described. A 64-year-old woman with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma developed persistent hypokalemia following a course of Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Adriamycin (doxorubicin), vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)-Bleo. The diagnosis of a functional Bartter's syndrome was concluded following evaluation of serial plasma renins, aldosterone levels, and urinary electrolytes. Evidence is suggestive that a subpopulation of patients receiving chemotherapy may develop a functional Bartter's syndrome, and it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who develop hypokalemia subsequent to chemotherapy introduction.
To describe a possible case of procainamide-induced intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice that was recognized six weeks after the initiation of procainamide therapy and to summarize the five previously reported cases.
A 77-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, temporal arteritis, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who had taken procainamide for six weeks presented to the hospital with disorientation and acute renal and hepatic dysfunction. In addition to disorientation, scleral icterus, and diffuse maculopapular rash, her physical examination was generally normal. There was no evidence of fever, nausea, vomiting, lymphadenopathy, or eosinophilia. Her liver enzyme concentrations increased significantly from baseline (beginning of procainamide therapy). Her N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) concentration was elevated to 52 mg/L upon admission. Procainamide was discontinued and her NAPA concentration returned to within normal limits in two days. Diagnostic tests were performed to rule out active hepatitis, vasculitis, and liver malignancies. After procainamide was discontinued and prednisone treatment was started, she became more oriented and her liver enzyme concentrations slowly improved.
Only five cases of procainamide-induced liver abnormalities have been previously reported; these included granulomatous hepatitis and intrahepatic cholestasis. The mechanism for liver dysfunction is not known; however, it is proposed to be a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Clinical hallmarks of hypersensitivity include fever, eosinophilia, rash, and lymphadenopathy; nausea and vomiting also may be present. Of the five reported cases, all experienced fever and only one experienced pruritus. No patients had eosinophilia or lymphadenopathy. Because of the temporal increase in liver enzyme concentrations after six weeks of procainamide therapy, we believe that this case represents another possible procainamide-induced hypersensitivity reaction.
Procainamide-induced liver dysfunction can occur from one day to six weeks after initiation of the drug and may subside one day to several weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, rash, and fever. Liver enzyme concentrations are abnormal. It is important to recognize the possibility of such a reaction early so that procainamide therapy can be discontinued promptly to avoid further liver damage.
Aging represents a major risk factor for the development and progression of Parkinson disease (PD), a chronic degenerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the subtantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Emerging evidence highlights the glia as a pivotal factor in PD etiology, and epidemiological studies indicate that certain nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may prevent or delay the progression of PD. Given that the exaggerated inflammatory response observed in old age may play a critical role in exacerbating DAergic vulnerability, we hypothesize here that switching the harmful glial response to inflammation and oxidative stress might increase the ability of the SN to resist inflammatory attacks. To this end, we developed a treatment in which we combined the effects of nitric oxide (NO) with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory activity by using HCT1026, a NO-donating derivative of flurbiprofen that has a safe profile and additional immunomodulatory properties. Young and aged mice fed with control or HCT1026 (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) diet were exposed to a single systemic injection of a subtoxic dose (0.2 mg kg(-1)) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of the most extensively used glial activators. HCT1026 efficiently reversed the age-dependent increase of microglial activation in response to LPS to levels measured in younger mice. In aged mice, LPS induced a progressive loss of DAergic neurons with no recovery for their entire life span, whereas younger mice or aged mice fed with HCT1026 were resistant to systemic LPS-induced DAergic neurodegeneration, underscoring glia as a key pharmacological target for DAergic neuroprotection.
Pure red cell aplasia developed in a 9-year-old girl receiving sodium valproate therapy. Infection with measles and chickenpox had occurred two months previously. Regeneration of bone marrow erythroid precursors was demonstrated one month after drug withdrawal. Readministration of sodium valproate resulted in a second episode of red cell aplasia that again resolved promptly after drug withdrawal. The respective roles of infection and drugs in the etiology of red cell aplasia are discussed.
The effects of the intravenous administration of hyaluronidase (HY; 2,500 IU/kg) and urokinase (UK; 20,000 and 40,000 IU/kg), alone or in combination, on the isoproterenol (ISP) induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats, were studied. The severity of infarction was determined by measuring the levels of serum enzymes (CPK, GOT, LDH) and by evaluating the extent of the injured areas and the incidence of mortality. Plasma thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels were also determined. All the treatments reduced the infarction area and the enzyme levels (increased by ISP) to a varying degree. However, a definite potentiating activity was obtained when HY was combined with the highest dose of UK. This combination was also capable of reducing the mortality rate. Finally, both HY and UK or the combined preparation brought the plasma TXB2 levels back to normal. These findings suggest the possibility of complementary activities of HY and UK in the treatment of experimental MI.
To determine whether H-7 can enhance outflow facility after trabecular meshwork obstruction by extracellular material that accumulates after long-term treatment of monkeys with the cholinesterase inhibitor echothiophate iodide (ECHO).
Cynomolgus monkeys were treated topically with 150 microg ECHO in one (n = 4 eyes) or both (n = 8 eyes) eyes for up to 48 weeks. Accommodation response to topical pilocarpine was monitored periodically. Outflow facility response to H-7 was measured by two-level constant pressure perfusion on three or four different occasions after intraocular pressure was elevated for 12 to 18 weeks.
Long-term treatment with ECHO decreased the accommodative response to pilocarpine and increased intraocular pressure, as has been reported. Baseline outflow facility was decreased by 46% +/- 7% (n = 12, P < 0.001). H-7 partially restored baseline outflow facility measured during subsequent perfusions while ECHO treatment was continued. Concurrent H-7 enhanced outflow facility by 73% +/- 18% (n = 12, P < 0.005) beyond the same-day baseline in ECHO-treated eyes. Cessation of ECHO treatment further restored baseline outflow facility, and the outflow facility response to H-7.
H-7 can enhance OF in the presence of trabecular obstruction produced by long-term ECHO treatment. This suggests that H-7 may be useful in treating glaucoma, even in the presence of accumulated plaque material that has been described previously.
A 60-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis, who developed acute reversible renal failure with nephrotic syndrome and tubulointerstitial nephritis in association with multiple-drug therapy, is described. The episode was ascribed to the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent fenbufen, and the patient was reexposed to D-penicillamine within 6 months, reproducing the same renal lesion. There was no evidence of the glomerular lesions characteristically associated with D-penicillamine nephrotoxicity. D-penicillamine was the only drug therapy common to both episodes and it is concluded that it may cause tubulointerstitial nephritis with nephrotic syndrome.
Curcumin (diferulolylmethane) has been shown to have a protective role in mouse models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and to reduce the relapse rate in human ulcerative colitis (UC), thus making it a potentially viable supportive treatment option. Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis in NKT-deficient SJL/J mice has been described as Th1-mediated inflammation, whereas BALB/c mice are believed to exhibit a mixed Th1/Th2 response.
We therefore investigated the effect of dietary curcumin in colitis induced in these 2 strains.
In the BALB/c mice, curcumin significantly increased survival, prevented weight loss, and normalized disease activity. In the SJL/J mice, curcumin demonstrated no protective effects. Genomewide microarray analysis of colonic gene expression was employed to define the differential effect of curcumin in these 2 strains. This analysis not only confirmed the disparate responses of the 2 strains to curcumin but also indicated different responses to TNBS. Curcumin inhibited proliferation of splenocytes from naive BALB/c mice but not SJL/J mice when nonspecifically stimulated in vitro with concanavalin A (ConA). Proliferation of CD4(+) splenocytes was inhibited in both strains, albeit with about a 2-fold higher IC(50) in SJL/J mice. Secretion of IL-4 and IL-5 by CD4(+) lymphocytes of BALB/c mice but not SJL/J mice was significantly augmented by ConA and reduced to control levels by curcumin.
The efficacy of dietary curcumin in TNBS colitis varies in BALB/c and SJL/J mouse strains. Although the exact mechanism underlying these differences is unclear, the results suggest that the therapeutic value of dietary curcumin may differ depending on the nature of immune dysregulation in IBD.
Edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) is a potent scavenger of free radicals and has the antioxidant ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation. Its protective effect on brain ischemia has been shown. This study aimed to elucidate its possible therapeutic effects on renal oxidative stress in a rat ischemia/reperfusion model.
Ischemic acute renal failure was induced by 45-minute clamp of the left renal artery followed by administration of edaravone. Renal function and pathologic findings were examined. The generation of free radicals was observed by the fluorogenic probe, dichlorodihydrofluorescein (CM-H(2)DCFDA), and lipid peroxidation was observed by immunochemical staining and Western analysis of 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE). The ability of edaravone to reduce in vitro oxidative stress was investigated using cultured human renal tubular cells (HKC-8) and the cell viability assay with Alamar blue.
Edaravone attenuated renal function and pathologic findings significantly. The protective effect of edaravone showed the dose-response was at the same level as that of dimethylthiourea. In addition, edaravone significantly reduced the generation of free radicals in the tubular cells indicated by CM-H(2)DCFDA. Immunochemical staining and Western analysis of HHE showed significant suppression of lipid peroxidation in edaravone-treated kidney. In HKC-8 cells loaded with CM-H(2)DCFDA, a marked elevation of fluorescence was observed after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mmol/L, for 1 hour), which was reduced by edaravone. The cell viability assay with Alamar blue also showed the protective effect of edaravone.
Edaravone ameliorates renal ischemia/reperfusion injury by scavenging free radicals produced in renal tubular cells and inhibiting lipid peroxidation.
Possible procoagulant effects can occur when lipid-lowering fibric acid derivatives, such as gemfibrozil and fenofibrate, are taken concomitantly with warfarin. Although there are several detailed reports of fenofibrate potentiating the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, few case reports have been published regarding an interaction between gemfibrozil and warfarin. We describe a 62-year-old man who was taking warfarin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and came to the anticoagulation clinic for a routine follow-up. For 9 months, the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) had been stable (target range 2.0-3.0) with warfarin 45 mg/week. At this clinic visit, however, his INR was supratherapeutic at 5.8; the only identified change in his drug therapy was the addition of gemfibrozil 600 mg twice/day, started 3 weeks earlier. The patient denied any changes in his dietary intake of vitamin K, alcohol use, or addition of nonprescription or herbal agents. Recent laboratory tests revealed no signs of thyroid abnormalities and only an insignificant elevation in his alanine aminotransferase level. His warfarin dose was decreased to 35-37.5 mg/week (a 22% reduction), and a therapeutic INR was maintained until gemfibrozil was later discontinued because of myalgia. After consecutive subtherapeutic INRs, his warfarin dose was increased to 45 mg/week and a therapeutic INR was maintained. Use of the Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicated that the likelihood of the gemfibrozil-warfarin interaction was probable. The exact mechanism of the proposed interactions between fibric acid derivatives and warfarin remains unknown but may be multifactorial through inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, displacement from protein binding sites, or changes in coagulation factor synthesis. Regardless of the fibric acid derivative chosen, an empiric dosage reduction of 20% and close INR monitoring are warranted in patients receiving warfarin.
We examined whether pretreatment with a small dose of thiopental was effective in reducing pain induced by the intravenous injection of rocuronium. Withdrawal movement was used to assess pain reduction. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: patients in the control group were pretreated with 2 mL saline, and those in the thiopental group were pretreated with 2 mL (50 mg) thiopental. Thiopental 5 mg/kg was injected intravenously. After a loss of consciousness, the upper arm was compressed with a rubber tourniquet, and the pretreatment drugs were administered. Thirty seconds later the tourniquet was removed and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium was administered. Withdrawal movement was assessed using a four-grade scale: no movement, movement limited to the wrist, to the elbow or to the shoulder. The frequency of withdrawal movement in the group pretreated with thiopental was lower than in the control group (34 vs. 13, p < 0.05). We concluded that pretreatment with 2 mL (50 mg) thiopental is effective in reducing pain caused by the intravenous injection of rocuronium.
Mutations in the SCN1A gene, which encodes the α1 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels, cause generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI). N1417H-Scn1a mutant rats are considered to be an animal model of human FS+ or GEFS+. To assess the pharmacologic validity of this model, we compared the efficacies of eight different antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the treatment of hyperthermia-induced seizures using N1417H-Scn1a mutant rats.
AEDs used in this study included valproate, carbamazepine (CBZ), phenobarbital, gabapentin, acetazolamide, diazepam (DZP), topiramate, and potassium bromide (KBr). The effects of these AEDs were evaluated using the hot water model, which is a model of experimental FS. Five-week-old rats were pretreated with each AED and immersed in water at 45°C to induce hyperthermia-induced seizures. The seizure manifestations and video-electroencephalographic recordings were evaluated. Furthermore, the effects of each AED on motor coordination and balance were assessed using the balance-beam test.
KBr significantly reduced seizure durations, and its anticonvulsant effects were comparable to those of DZP. On the other hand, CBZ decreased the seizure threshold. In addition, DZP and not KBr showed significant impairment in motor coordination and balance.
DZP and KBr showed potent inhibitory effects against hyperthermia-induced seizures in the Scn1a mutant rats, whereas CBZ exhibited adverse effects. These responses to hyperthermia-induced seizures were similar to those in patients with GEFS+ and SMEI. N1417H-Scn1a mutant rats may, therefore, be useful for testing the efficacy of new AEDs against FS in GEFS+ and SMEI patients.
Septal perforation from intranasal cocaine abuse is well recognised. We present a case of progressive septal as well as palatal perforation. Progression from septal perforation to palatal perforation occurred after cessation of intranasal cocaine abuse. This patient had a weakly positive cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (C-ANCA) but no histologic evidence of Wegener's Granulomatosis. The differential diagnosis for septal and palatal perforation is reviewed. This case represents the fifth reported case of palatal perforation secondary to cocaine abuse in the literature, and the second associated with positive C-ANCA.
