Herpes simplex virus type 1 is a common cause of severe sporadic encephalitis. Treatment with acyclovir is highly effective in this disease. We report the case of a 27-year-old, immunocompetent woman with acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex encephalitis. Although she had not been treated before, herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA from the cerebrospinal fluid showed a non-synonymous mutation in the thymidine kinase gene, which is likely to have caused resistance to acyclovir. Herpes simplex encephalitis resolved after treatment with foscarnet. To our knowledge, this is the first report of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus encephalitis in an immunocompetent, previously therapy-naive adult.
Hodgkin's lymphoma is rarely evidenced by dermatological signs or symptoms.
A 37 year-old man progressively developed widespread cutaneous roughness, with small parallel lines producing fish-like scales. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of acquired ichthyosis, as evidenced by the absence of the epidermal granular layer. The patient's condition was assessed to be satisfactory. However, two months later, his general condition had gradually deteriorated (night sweats, weight loss, axillary and scalp alopecia, and adenopathies). Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed. After treatment with adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine and dacarbazine, complete remission of the lymphoma was obtained, and concomitantly, the symptoms of acquired ichthyosis resolved; this was confirmed by serial skin biopsies that evidenced the progressive complete restoration of the granular layer. The level of plasmatic vitamin A and carotene, which had decreased before the treatment, returned to normal values. A subsequent relapse of Hodgkin's lymphoma was preceded by the recurrence of ichthyosis; this time vitamin A and carotene levels were not decreased.
As a paraneoplastic syndrome, acquired ichthyosis as a first sign of Hodgkin's lymphoma is discussed. In the presence of acquired ichthyosis, repeated monitoring of the patient is required since clinical symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma are often delayed. Acquired ichthyosis is also an early marker of lymphoma recurrence.
To investigate the inhibitive effect and its possible mechanism of Cordyceps Sinensis (CS) on CCl(4)-plus ethanol-induced hepatic fibrogenesis in experimental rats.
Rats were randomly allocated into a normal control group, a model control group and a CS group. The latter two groups were administered with CCl(4) and ethanol solution at the beginning of the experiment to induce hepatic fibrosis. The CS group was also treated with CS 10 days after the beginning of CCl(4) and ethanol administration. All control groups were given corresponding placebo at the same time. At the end of the 9th week, rats in each group were humanely sacrificed. Blood and tissue specimens were taken. Biochemical, radioimmunological, immunohistochemical and molecular biological examinations were used to determine the level change of ALT, AST, HA, LN content in serum and TGFbeta(1), PDGF, collagen I and III expression in tissue at either protein or mRNA level or both of them.
As compared with the model control group, serum ALT, AST, HA, and LN content levels were markedly dropped in CS group (86.0+/-34.4 vs 224.3+/-178.9, 146.7+/-60.2 vs 272.6+/-130.1, 202.0+/-79.3 vs 316.5+/-94.1 and 50.4+/-3.0 vs 59.7+/-9.8, respectively, P<0.05). Tissue expression of TGFbeta(1) and its mRNA, collagen I mRNA were also markedly decreased (0.2+/-0.14 vs 1.73+/-1.40, 1.68+/-0.47 vs 3.17+/-1.17, 1.10+/-0.84 vs 2.64+/-1.40, respectively, P<0.05). More dramatical drop could be seen in PDGF expression (0.87+/-0.43 vs 1.91+/-0.74, P<0.01). Although there was no statistical significance, it was still strongly suggested that collagen III mRNA expression was also decreased in CS group as compared with model control group (0.36+/-0.27 vs 0.95+/-0.65, P=0.0615). In this experiment, no significant change could be found in PDGF mRNA expression between two groups (0.35+/-0.34 vs 0.70+/-0.46, P>0.05).
Cordyceps sinensis could inhibit hepatic fibrogenesis derived from chronic liver injury, retard the development of cirrhosis, and notably ameliorate the liver function. Its possible mechanism involves inhibiting TGFbeta(1) expression, and thereby, down regulating PDGF expression, preventing HSC activation and deposition of procollagen I and III.
7 cases of stuporous states or coma induced in epileptic subjects by the rapid administration of high doses of sodium valproate are described. Progressive impairment of consciousness began 2 to 7 days after the administration of sodium valproate and induced a slowing of background EEG activity until the delta activity became of high amplitude, generalized, continuous and areactive. The authors believe that the impairment of consciousness in their patients was related to the rapid administration of high doses and a direct intrinsic action of sodium valproate on the brain, as no increase in plasma levels of the drugs in association with valproate was observed.
Micro-injection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats, stroke-prone strain (SHRSP), caused a fall in blood pressure of 30-40 mmHg, maximally 2-3 h after administration. This hypotension was abolished by the selective serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly, but it was not affected by intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a selective lesion of serotonin nerves descending into the spinal cord, or by injection of 5,7-DHT into the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells. It seems likely that the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.
Agricultural workers are exposed to airborne pollutants, including organic and inorganic (mineral) dusts.
Lung autopsy specimens from consecutive coroner's cases of Hispanic males in Fresno County, California, (n = 112) were obtained to determine whether mineral dust exposure in agricultural work leads to pneumoconiosis.
The left lung was fixed by inflation. We evaluated airway and parenchymal pathology using standardized diagnostic criteria and semiquantitative grading schemata, including the grading of small airways for fibrosis and birefringent mineral dust particles. We analyzed lung dust burden on a subset of 37 lungs following bleach digestion, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray spectrometry (XRS) and image analysis, and by X-ray diffraction for crystalline silica (CSi). Farmworkers comprised 51.5% and nonfarmworkers 48.5% of the samples.
Proximal airways demonstrated little mineral dust accumulation, but membranous and respiratory bronchioles had wall thickening, remodeling, and inflammation associated with carbonaceous and mineral dust deposition. These changes were independently associated with agricultural work, cigarette smoking, and increased age. Mineral dust small airways disease, pneumoconiosis (macules and nodules), and pathologic changes consistent with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and interstitial fibrosis predominated in farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers. CSi, determined gravimetrically, and aluminum silicate particles, determined by SEM/XRS, were increased in the lungs of farmworkers compared with nonfarmworkers and were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with small airway disease and pneumoconiosis.
Mineral dust exposure is associated with increased small airway disease and pneumoconiosis among California farmworkers; however, the clinical significance and natural history of these changes remains to be determined.
D-hormone [1,25(OH)2 D3] is an important immune system regulator that has been shown to inhibit development of autoimmune diseases including experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), and type 1 diabetes. Paradoxically, other immune mediated diseases (experimental asthma) and immunity to infectious organisms were not found to be affected by D-hormone treatment. The effectiveness of D-hormone treatment of autoimmune diseases is due to inhibition of the development and function of Th1 cells and the induction of other Th cells including Th2 cells. We report results of microarray analysis of colons from D-hormone treated mice with experimental IBD. Two hundred thirty-nine genes were inhibited and 298 genes were upregulated in the colon by D-hormone treatment of mice with IBD. Of interest was the D-hormone mediated inhibition of 3 tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha factor, and TNF receptor) related genes in the colon. It is likely that the effectiveness of D-hormone treatment of experimental autoimmunity is due in part to the inhibition of the TNF family of genes. D-hormone is a selective regulator of the immune system, and the outcome of D-hormone treatment depends on the nature (infectious disease, asthma, autoimmune disease, etc.) of the immune response.
Understanding the progression from beryllium exposure (BeE) to chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is essential for optimizing screening and early intervention to prevent CBD.
We developed an analytic markov model of progression to cbd that assigns annual probabilities for progression through three states: from BeE to beryllium sensitization and then to CBD. We used calculations of the number in each state over time to assess which of several alternative progression models are most consistent with the limited available empirical data on prevalence and incidence. We estimated cost-effectiveness of screening considering both incremental (cost/case) and cumulative program costs.
No combination of parameters for a simple model in which risk of progression remains constant over time can meet the empirical constraints of relatively frequent early cases and continuing development of new cases with long latencies. Modeling shows that the risk of progression is initially high and then declines over time. Also, it is likely that there are at least two populations that differ significantly in risk. The cost-effectiveness of repetitive screening declines over time, although new cases will still be found with long latencies. However, screening will be particularly cost-effective when applied to persons with long latencies who have not been previously screened.
To optimize use of resources, the intensity of screening should decrease over time. Estimation of lifetime cumulative CBD risk should consider the declining risk of progression over time.
This study was designed to examine the effects of squalene on tissue antioxidant status in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in male albino rats. Levels of diagnostic marker enzymes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK)] in plasma, lipid peroxides, reduced glutathione, and the activities of glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzymes [glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)] and antiperoxidative enzymes [catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)] in the heart tissue of experimental groups of rats were determined. The prior administration of squalene at 2% level along with feed for 45 days significantly prevented the isoproterenol-induced elevation in the levels of diagnostic marker enzymes in plasma of experimental rats. Squalene also exerted an antioxidant effect against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction by blocking the induction of lipid peroxidation. A tendency to prevent the isoproterenol-induced alterations in the level of reduced glutathione and in the activities of glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzymes and antiperoxidative enzymes was also observed. The cardioprotective effect of squalene might be ascribable to its antioxidant property and membrane stabilizing action.
Research suggests that independent and joint effects of genetic variability in the dopamine transporter (DAT) locus and pesticides may influence Parkinson's disease (PD) risk.
In 324 incident PD patients and 334 population controls from our rural California case-control study, we genotyped rs2652510, rs2550956 (for the DAT 5' clades), and the 3' variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). Using geographic information system methods, we determined residential exposure to agricultural maneb and paraquat applications. We also collected occupational pesticide use data. Employing logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for clade diplotypes, VNTR genotype, and number of susceptibility (A clade and 9-repeat) alleles and assessed susceptibility allele-pesticide interactions.
PD risk was increased separately in DAT A clade diplotype carriers [AA vs. BB: OR = 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.57] and 3' VNTR 9/9 carriers (9/9 vs. 10/10: OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 0.96-3.57), and our data suggest a gene dosing effect. Importantly, high exposure to paraquat and maneb in carriers of one susceptibility allele increased PD risk 3-fold (OR = 2.99; 95% CI, 0.88-10.2), and in carriers of two or more alleles more than 4-fold (OR = 4.53; 95% CI, 1.70-12.1). We obtained similar results for occupational pesticide measures.
Using two independent pesticide measures, we a) replicated previously reported gene-environment interactions between DAT genetic variants and occupational pesticide exposure in men and b) overcame previous limitations of nonspecific pesticide measures and potential recall bias by employing state records and computer models to estimate residential pesticide exposure.
Our results suggest that DAT genetic variability and pesticide exposure interact to increase PD risk.
The metabolism of arachidonic acid by mixed suspensions of leukocytes and platelets prepared from peripheral blood has been studied in 20 patients with psoriasis and 21 healthy controls. A lipoxygenase-derived product, identified as 12,20-dihydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid was formed in increased amounts by the cell suspension from the psoriatic patients. This product results from the metabolism of platelet-derived 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid by the polymorphonuclear leukocyte 20-hydroxylase enzyme. By contrast, synthesis of the cyclo-oxygenase products 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid and thromboxane B2 was diminished. Benoxaprofen, which is known to be beneficial in psoriasis, diminished the levels of 12,20-dihydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid formed in vitro.
A clear association has been established between cocaine use and acute myocardial infarction. Because of the continuing rise in cocaine use in the United States, many more young patients have or will have this disorder. Such patients are usually managed conservatively with calcium channel blockade and have an excellent in-hospital prognosis. If chest pain recurs or stress testing reveals evidence of ischemia, cardiac catheterization should be done. If cocaine use is discontinued, the long-term prognosis of a typical patient with cocaine-induced acute myocardial infarction is excellent in the absence of other chronic illnesses.
A case of community-acquired endocarditis caused by Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis with high-level resistance to gentamicin sulfate but not to streptomycin sulfate is described. Killing curves performed using achievable serum levels showed synergistic killing when streptomycin but not gentamicin, tobramycin, or amikacin was combined with penicillin G sodium or vancomycin hydrochloride. Combination therapy with vancomycin and streptomycin resulted in cure. Serum bactericidal levels indicated activity of the synergistic, as well as a nonsynergistic (vancomycin plus gentamicin), combination. Routine screening of blood isolates for high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin can provide guidance for selection of therapeutic combinations in serious enterococcal infections, including endocarditis.
Adjuvant tamoxifen has become the treatment of choice against estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Adverse effects are rarely observed and since symptoms of hepatic steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis are usually negligible, such effects are not well characterized despite large cohort studies of adjuvant tamoxifen. This issue remains to be systematically studied. The present study consisted of 136 breast cancer patients treated with or without tamoxifen. Patients had laboratory tests once each month and underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) annually for 5 years. The extent of hepatic steatosis was assessed by CT as the liver/spleen ratio. While receiving adjuvant tamoxifen, 40 of 105 patients developed hepatic steatosis (liver/spleen ratio <0.9) without obvious changes in body mass index. Twenty-one had a liver spleen ratio of <0.5, whereas none of the 31 patients treated without tamoxifen had a ratio <0.9 or <0.5 (p<0.0001 and p<0.0001, respectively). Hepatic steatosis was recognized in 35 of the 40 patients within the first 2 years of receiving adjuvant tamoxifen and 21 of the 40 had increased transaminase levels. Liver biopsy revealed NASH in 6 of 7 patients among the 21 with a liver/spleen ratio of <0.5. A subset of individuals given adjuvant tamoxifen developed progressive hepatic steatosis without significant changes in the body mass index. We suggest a liver/spleen ratio of <0.5 as a criterion upon which liver biopsy should be recommended since NASH frequently occurred in such patients.
Hypersensitivity to abacavir affects about 4% of patients who receive the drug for HIV-1 infection. We did a retrospective, case-control study to identify multiple markers in the vicinity of HLA-B associated with hypersensitivity reactions. HLA-B57 was present in 39 (46%) of 84 patients versus four (4%) of 113 controls (p<0 small middle dot0001). However, because of low numbers of women and other ethnic groups enrolled, these findings relate largely to white men. The lower sensitivity of HLA-B57 for predicting hypersensitivity to abacavir identified in this study compared with a previous report highlights that predictive values for markers will vary across populations. Clinical monitoring and management of hypersensitivity reactions among patients receiving abacavir must remain unchanged.
Incidence of childhood leukemia in industrialized countries rose significantly during 1975-2004, and the reasons for the increase are not understood.
We used carpet dust as an exposure indicator to examine the risk of childhood leukemia in relation to residential exposure to persistent organochlorine chemicals: six polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and the pesticides alpha- and gamma-chlordane, p,p'-DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), p,p'-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), methoxychlor, and pentachlorophenol.
We conducted a population-based case-control study in 35 counties in northern and central California in 2001-2006. The study included 184 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases 0-7 years of age and 212 birth certificate controls matched to cases by birth date, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. We collected carpet dust samples from the room where the child spent the most time before diagnosis (similar date for controls) using a specialized vacuum.
Detection of any PCB congener in the dust conferred a 2-fold increased risk of ALL [odds ratio (OR) = 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-3.17]. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of total PCBs, the highest quartile was associated with about a 3-fold risk (OR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.41-5.48), and the positive trend was significant (p = 0.017). Significant positive trends in ALL risk were apparent with increasing concentrations of PCB congeners 118, 138, and 153. We observed no significant positive associations for chlordane, DDT, DDE, methoxychlor, or pentachlorophenol. The associations with PCBs were stronger among non-Hispanic whites than among Hispanics despite similar distributions of PCB levels among controls in each racial/ethnic group.
Our findings suggest that PCBs, which are considered probable human carcinogens and cause perturbations of the immune system, may represent a previously unrecognized risk factor for childhood leukemia.
Spongiform leukoencephalopathy is a rare complication from inhalation of heated heroin vapour, a practice called "chasing the dragon". The MRI findings are considered pathognomonic, making MRI important for diagnosis. This is especially true in busy urban emergency departments where a variety of patients may present obtunded, unable or unwilling to provide a useful history. Even though the MR pattern of "chasing" toxicity is considered pathognomonic, there are mimickers. We compare the MRI findings of two classic cases of chasing leukoencephalopathy with one case of mimickery from cocaine exposure only. All three cases had diffuse symmetrical white matter changes. MR spectroscopy (MRS) in chasing patients showed increased lactic acid and myo-inositol, decreased N-acetyl aspartate and creatine, normal to slightly decreased choline, and normal lipid peak. MRS in the cocaine exposure patient showed marked increase in lactic acid and lipids. MR perfusion in one chasing patient was normal.
(1) All three cases have MR findings suggestive of spongiform leukoencephalopathy. MRS may help differentiate toxicity due to inhaled heroin from other non-heroin related toxicities. (2) Discordance between perfusion and spectroscopy in one chasing patient adds evidence that the disease is due to impaired energy metabolism at the cellular level. (3) MR findings of spongiform leukoencephalopathy secondary to chasing heroin can progress despite apparent abstinence of the drug and during clinical improvement, suggesting the MR changes may represent an evolving injury.
The etiology of childhood brain cancer remains largely unknown. However, previous studies have yielded suggestive associations with parental pesticide use.
We aimed to evaluate parental exposure to pesticides at home and on the job in relation to the occurrence of brain cancer in children.
We included 526 one-to-one-matched case-control pairs. Brain cancer cases were diagnosed at < 10 years of age, and were identified from statewide cancer registries of four U.S. Atlantic Coast states. We selected controls by random digit dialing. We conducted computer-assisted telephone interviews with mothers. Using information on residential pesticide use and jobs held by fathers during the 2-year period before the child's birth, we assessed potential exposure to insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. For each job, two raters independently classified the probability and intensity of exposure; 421 pairs were available for final analysis. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression, after adjustment for maternal education.
A significant risk of astrocytoma was associated with exposures to herbicides from residential use (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0). Combining parental exposures to herbicides from both residential and occupational sources, the elevated risk remained significant (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1). We observed little association with primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) for any of the pesticide classes or exposure sources considered.
Our observation is consistent with a previous literature reporting suggestive associations between parental exposure to pesticides and risk of astrocytoma in offspring but not PNET. However, these findings should be viewed in light of limitations in exposure assessment and effective sample size.
Lead (Pb) increases lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide (NO), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and liver damage. In this study, we investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the causal relationships between TNF-alpha, NO, and LPO in Pb-increased LPS-induced liver damage in rats. Treatment with PKC and p42/44 MAPK inhibitors significantly reduced Pb + LPS-induced NO, TNF-alpha, LPO, and liver damage, which was revealed by elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Pb + LPS coexposure significantly increased phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK and TNF-alpha expression in peripheral blood cells; however, exposure to Pb + LPS did not induce TNF-alpha, NO, or LPO production and p42/44 MAPK activation in the liver. Pentoxifylline, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, also reduced liver damage but did not alter NO or LPO in Pb + LPS-treated rats. Thus, Pb increased LPS-induced liver damage through PKC and p42/44 MAPK modulation of TNF-alpha and oxidative stress, but modulation of TNF-alpha did not affect NO or LPO in rats.
Patients with E/beta(0) thalassaemia, the most common haemoglobinopathy in many Asian countries, might benefit from drugs that increase fetal and total haemoglobin and thereby decrease the need for transfusions. The long-term clinical efficacy and safety of such therapy is unknown, limiting its use in countries where resources for safe and regular transfusion are scarce. In this study, 45 patients were treated with hydroxyurea (18-20 mg/kg) for 24+/-9 months, hydroxyurea with sodium phenyl butyrate (n=8) and hydroxyurea with erythropoietin (n=9), each for approximately 6 months, and followed for 3 years from study exit. Hydroxyurea had minimal toxicity, resulted in a mean 1.3 g/dl steady-state increase in haemoglobin in 40% of patients, and a milder response (<OR=1 g/dl) in the others. Baseline haemoglobin F was significantly associated with an increase in haemoglobin (P<0.001). Combined treatment with erythropoietin benefited selected patients, but the addition of sodium phenyl butyrate had no effect. Of the 27/45 patients who discontinued regular transfusions before the study, 13 remained transfusion independent during long-term follow-up, 6/13 continued hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea moderately increased steady-state haemoglobin in a sub-group of E/beta(0) thalassaemia patients and can be considered for patients with intermediate severity disease, thus delaying or avoiding the need for life-long transfusions. Continuous monitoring of toxicity and growth is required.
The antidiuretic responses of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) were studied in rats with marked lithium-polyuria (about 100 ml/100 g/24 h) induced by administration of lithium to the diet for 3-4 months. The hormones were infused i.v. and s.c. at a constant rate for 7 days using implantable osmotic minipumps. Body weight, food consumption and urine volume and osmolality were recorded daily. Whereas supramaximal doses of AVP only had little effect on spontaneous urine flow and osmolality, DDAVP (0.1 microgram/h i.v. or 1 microgram/H s.c.) restored urine volume and osmolality to near-normal values. Although the mechanism of the antidiuresis evoked by DDAVP was not investigated the ability of this compound to reverse AVP-resistant polyuria may be due to its specificity and high intrinsic activity in stimulating the vasopressin receptor. The reversibility of lithium-induced impairment of renal concentrating ability caused by excessive hormonal stimulation is not immediately compatible with the recent hypothesis that lithium-polyuria may reflect irreversible structural kidney damage.
High doses of parenteral opioids can cause multifocal myoclonus and seizures. Spasticity has been reported in patients receiving intraspinal opioids. In this article, we describe a patient who developed reversible spastic paraparesis with prominent extensor spasms in the legs while receiving an infusion of intravenous methadone at 100 mg/hr. We discuss clinical presentation and possible pathophysiologic mechanisms of opioid side effects on the somatic motor system.
We report a case of palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) in a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with VALP regime. The treating physician must be aware of this uncommon complication of chemotherapeutic agents to avoid unnecessary investigations.
The signs of neurotoxicity observed in the cat and the rat following single or multiple doses of the phosphorous acid ester triphenyl phosphite (TPP) have been reported to differ from the syndrome known as organophosphorous compound induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) caused by some phosphoric acid esters. Since the hen is the test animal traditionally used to test compounds for OPIDN, we chose to study the neurotoxicity of single, subcutaneous doses of TPP using the hen. TPP (1000 mg/kg) produced progressive ataxia and paralysis which developed 5-10 days after dosing. The clinical signs were accompanied by axonal damage in the lateral columns of the spinal cord and peripheral nerve. Similar signs were observed following neurotoxic doses of the OPIDN-causing agents tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) or diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP). In addition, TPP caused damage to axons in the brain and gray matter of the spinal cord, and chromatolysis and neuronal necrosis were frequently observed in the spinal cord. These latter areas were not affected by TOCP or DFP. The minimum neurotoxic dose of TPP was found to be 500 mg/kg. Prior administration of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) reduced the incidence of damage to the peripheral nerve of animals dosed with TPP, but did not prevent toxic effects on the cell bodies in the spinal cord or the clinical effects. The results of this study indicate that TPP causes neuronal damage in addition to the axonal damage observed with OPIDN. Therefore, we conclude that two distinct mechanisms underlie the neurotoxicity of TPP.
This study was performed to examine the role of superoxide (O2-) in the development of salt sensitivity and hypertension induced by inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) generation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with diet containing either normal salt (NS) (0.4% NaCl) or high salt (HS) (4% NaCl). These rats were treated with or without an NO synthase inhibitor, nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) (15 mg/kg/d) and O2- scavenger, tempol (30 mg/kg per day) in the drinking water for 4 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography and urine collection was performed during the course of experimental periods. At the end of 4 weeks, L-NAME treatment resulted in greater increases in SBP in HS rats (127+/-2 to 172+/-3 mm Hg; n=8) than in NS rats (130+/-2 to 156+/-2 mm Hg; n=9). Co-administration of tempol with L-NAME markedly attenuated these SBP responses to a similar level in both HS (128+/-3 to 147+/-2 mm Hg; n=8) and NS rats (126+/-2 to 142+/-3 mm Hg; n=8). Urinary 8-isoprostane excretion (UIsoV) increased in response to L-NAME treatment that was higher in HS (10.6+/-0.5 to 21.5+/-0.8 ng/d) than in NS rats (10.8+/-0.7 to 16.9+/-0.6 ng/d). Co-treatment with tempol completely abolished these UIsoV responses to L-NAME in both HS and NS rats but did not alter urinary H2O2 excretion rate. The decreases in urinary nitrate/nitrite excretion in response to L-NAME treatment were not altered by co-administration of tempol in both HS and NS rats. These data suggest that enhancement of O2- activity during NO inhibition contributes to the development of salt sensitivity that is associated with NO-deficient hypertension.
A 41-year-old woman with breast cancer developed a manic episode while being treated with a 5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide combination (most likely caused by the first drug). Chemotherapy was discontinued, and antipsychotic treatment with haloperidol and olanzapine was instituted. She recovered after 10 days. Normal computerized tomography (CT) scans and neurological examinations were consistent with the absence of neurological symptoms on physical exam.
