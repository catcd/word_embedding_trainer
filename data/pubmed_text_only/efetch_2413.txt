An open-label phase I trial of thalidomide (TL) in 20 patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) treated symptomatic plexiform neurofibroma (PNF). TL was well tolerated in doses up to 200 mg/d. Adverse reactions included transient somnolence in four, evanescent rash in two, and reversible mild peripheral neuropathy in two patients. Four patients showed less than 25% reduction in the tumor size. TL may have a role in the treatment of PNF and should be explored in a larger controlled study, possibly using higher doses of TL.
Vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity typically manifests as acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. The drug does appear, however, to increase the nephrotoxicity of concurrently administered aminoglycosides. The extent of direct tubular toxicity attributable to vancomycin, especially in the absence of aminoglycoside treatment, does not appear to have been previously described. We report a case of biopsy-proven acute tubular necrosis secondary to vancomycin toxicity in a 13-year-old boy where there was no likely alternate explanation for toxic or ischemic injury. No hemodialysis was required, and the patient made a full recovery with subsequently regained renal function.
This report centers on a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer who developed acute and chronic cholecystitis secondary to the infusion of FUDR (fluoro-deoxyuridine) into the hepatic artery. This was documented by sonography, cholescintigraphy, and, ultimately, pathologically on the surgically removed specimen. Undoubtedly, with increasing cumulative treatment days made possible through technological advances in delivery systems, this complication will be seen more frequently. Prophylactic removal of the gallbladder, at the time of pump placement, which does not significantly prolong the operative time nor increase the operative mortality, should be performed to prevent this complication from occurring.
To elucidate the etiology of the thrombogenic effects of high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in the treatment of breast cancer, hematologic parameters were sequentially assessed in 12 patients receiving MPA 800 mg p.o. daily for 6 months as adjuvant hormone therapy after mastectomy. The results were as follows. (1) Coagulation system: levels of factor VII and fibrinogen decreased significantly, whereas factors II and IX increased significantly, with a shortened activated partial thromboplastin time. (2) Fibrinolytic system: plasminogen and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex increased, whereas fibrinogen degradation products remained low. (3) Anticoagulation system: antithrombin III increased significantly. (4) These changes were most marked after 2 or 4 weeks of MPA treatment, and returned to the pretreatment level one month after discontinuation of treatment. (5) No patients in this study developed thromboembolic disease during or after MPA administration. These results indicate that MPA may induce a hypercoagulable state, but this state does not directly lead to the development of thrombosis.
Previous studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with mannitol, furosemide, or bradykinin can attenuate the severity of norepinephrine-induced renal functional impairment. The present studies were designed to evaluate the possibility that these agents are protective, in part, by preserving cellular metabolic integrity. The renal cortex was repetitively biopsied during the course of this study, and high-pressure liquid chromatography was used to analyze the tissue content of adenine nucleotides (expressed in nanomoles per gram of wet tissue). The adenine nucleotide charge ratio (CR) and total adenine nucleotide (TAN) content were calculated as indices of cellular metabolic integrity. In addition to the above-established protective agents, phenoxybenzamine was used to evaluate a direct toxic effect of norepinephrine on renal tissue. Inulin clearance at 3 hours post infusion (expressed as a percent of control) was 7% with norepinephrine alone and, in the protected groups, 36% with bradykinin, 61% with furosemide, 51% with mannitol, and 100% with phenoxybenzamine. There was no change in CR or TAN with phenoxybenzamine. In contrast, during norepinephrine administration CR fell significantly in all other groups. Three hours after stopping norepinephrine, CR had returned toward control values and the level of CR was significantly better in all protected groups when compared with norepinephrine alone. Similarly, the levels of TAN were significantly diminished in the norepinephrine-alone group when compared to all protected groups, and there was significantly more tubular necrosis as well. The maintenance of higher levels of TAN and the preserved ability to regenerate adenosine triphosphate in the protected groups, when compared to the norepinephrine-alone group, support the contention that these agents offer protection, at least in part, by preserving cellular metabolic integrity.
Daily administration of d,l isoproterenol-HCl (5 mg/kg) in rats for periods of 14-21 days results in marked cardiac hypertrophy and a decrease in cardiac actomyosin ATPase activity. Actomyosin suspensions (ionic strength 0.08) from right and left ventricles showed average decreases in ATPase activity of 37.1% (p less than 0.005) and 35.7% (p less than 0.05), respectively, for animals treated with isoproterenol for 14 days. Isolated myofibrils from combined ventricular muscle of another group of animals that received the same isoproterenol treatment showed an average decrease in ATPase of 36.4% (p less than 0.0025). The later experiments also demonstrated that the decrease in ATPase activity was not Ca++ sensitive suggesting the lack of involvement of a change in the calcium regulatory factors (tropomyosin-troponin complex). In contrast to these findings, purified myosin from treated animals and actomyosin assayed under conditions which essentially reflect myosin ATPase activity uninfluenced by actin interaction (actomyosin in solution, ionic strength 0.6), did not demonstrate a change in ATPase from controls. It was concluded that the decrease in cardiac actomyosin ATPase in isoproterenol treated rats involved primarily a defect in actin or the interaction of actin with other components of the contractile protein complex.
Two angiotensin II (Ang II)-specific receptors, AGTR1 and AGTR2, are expressed in the mammalian brain. Ang II actions on blood pressure regulation, water electrolyte balance, and hormone secretion are primarily mediated by AGTR1. The function of AGTR2 remains unclear. Here, we show that expression of the AGTR2 gene was absent in a female patient with mental retardation (MR) who had a balanced X;7 chromosomal translocation. Additionally, 8 of 590 unrelated male patients with MR were found to have sequence changes in the AGTR2 gene, including one frameshift and three missense mutations. These findings indicate a role for AGTR2 in brain development and cognitive function.
The aim of this open multicentric study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the addition of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (benazepril, 10 mg/day) or a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg/day) for 4 weeks in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension having been treated for 4 weeks by an angiotensin II antagonist (valsartan, 80 mg/day) but still having a diastolic blood pressure (BP) > 90 mmHg on this medication given alone.
A total of 327 patients were included in the trial and 153 patients (46%) had their diastolic BP </= 90 mmHg after 4 weeks of valsartan monotherapy. These patients continued the same treatment regimen for the next 4 weeks, but no further blood pressure reduction was observed. The remaining patients were randomized to either the valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide or the valsartan-benazepril combination.
The two combinations induced an additional significant BP reduction, which was of similar magnitude for diastolic BP (-4.5 during valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide treatment and -3.3 mmHg during valsartan-benazepril treatment), but of greater magnitude for systolic BP during valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide (-6.77 mmHg) than during valsartan-benazepril co-administration (-3.2 mmHg). At the end of the trial, the BP of the responders to the valsartan monotherapy was lower than that of patients having required a combination therapy. Valsartan given alone or in association with hydrochlorothiazide or benazepril was well tolerated.
These data therefore show that in patients not responding sufficiently to angiotensin II receptor blockade BP can be further and safely lowered by adding a small dose of a diuretic or an ACE inhibitor, with the diuretic-containing combination tending to being more effective in controlling systolic BP.
This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se, or, at least in part, to the aminonucleoside. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syndrome. Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-nephrotic stage (day 1-5) and nephrotic stage (day 6-11). In pre-nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids, triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant. Plasma apolipoprotein A-I tended to increase (40% increase at day 5). At the beginning of nephrotic stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A-I increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days. The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern. Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage (day 9). Plasma apolipoprotein A-I was found not only in HDL (1.063-1.210 g/ml) but also in the LDL density class (1.025-1.050 g/ml). In the pre-nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL. These observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL. It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism.
Accidental intravascular administration of bupivacaine can cause severe neurotoxic and cardiotoxic effects. We report a case of suspected bupivacaine intoxication due to intravascular injection via an epidural catheter and treatment with lidocaine, propofol, and a 20% lipid emulsion resulting in fast resolution of cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effects. Possible mechanisms of action of the medications used are discussed.
A case of severe hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia in connection with indapamide treatment is reported. Indapamide affects plasma potassium and also blood glucose. The significance of regular control of these parameters during treatment is emphasized.
Administration of greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg isoproterenol in rats absolutely diminished local myocardial blood flow within 0.5 min continuing up to 45 min. The blood flow reduction was followed by an increased lactate content and a decrease of both the intracellular redox potential and the content of high energy phosphates in the myocardium. The graduation of the initial lactate accumulation in different myocardial regions corresponds to the myocardial distribution of the infarct-like necroses occurring 24 h later. The very early alterations are comparable with an absolute (blood flow reduction), irreversible, and acute ischemia. In the dose range from 0.05 to 1 mg/kg of isoproterenol, an acceleration of the local myocardial blood flow was caused which, however, was accompanied by ischemia-like disturbances, too. Therefore, this condition is considered as a relative ischemia, an increased but insufficient blood supply.
A 56-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and cadaveric renal transplantation had vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium tricuspid valve endocarditis. Relapse followed 6 weeks of treatment with intravenous gentamicin and high-dose ampicillin. On the basis of previous data suggesting the potential for synergistic activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin plus high-dose ampicillin, therapy with this combination was administered for 63 days. Cure was achieved and later confirmed at 2-year follow-up.
Ventricular arrhythmias can both result from and cause myocardial dysfunction. We report a case of a two-year-old girl with ventricular tachycardia showing signs of heart failure consisting with a tachycardiomyopathy. The therapy with class I and class III antiarrhythmic drugs did not improve the cardiac situation significantly. The cardiologic investigations were consistent with the verapamil-sensitive ventricular tachycardia in young adults. The treatment with verapamil led to a normal rhythm and function of the heart.
Verapamil-type calcium channel blockers can also be used in children for the treatment of ventricular tachycardias if the corresponding investigations show characteristic findings.
GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its concentration in the brain in associated with a variety of neurological disorders, including seizures, convulsions, and epilepsy. The concentration of GABA is modulated by the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, GAD and GABA-T. In this study, we generated pyridoxyl-gamma-aminobutyrate (PL-GABA), a novel GABA analogue composed of pyridoxyl and GABA, and have also characterized its anticonvulsant and pharmacological functions in vitro. The results of biodistribution studies revealed that PL-GABA is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. PL-GABA evidenced anticonvulsant activity in a wide range of epilepsy models, some of which were electrically-based (MES seizures) and some chemically-based (bicuculline, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxine, 3-mercaptopropionic acid). Following a timed subcutaneous administration of PTZ to mice, PL-GABA consistently increased the latencies to first twitch and clonus. In addition, PL-GABA displayed no signs of tolerance after subchronic (10 day) treatment. PL-GABA appears to exert its anticonvulsant effects by influencing seizure spread and by raising the seizure threshold. Therefore, our results indicate that PL-GABA exerts a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant effect, and identify the potential for reduced PL-GABA tolerance as an additional positive profile for novel antiepileptic drugs.
The antidiabetic drug metformin is currently used prior and during pregnancy for polycystic ovary syndrome, as well as during gestational diabetes mellitus. We investigated the effects of prenatal metformin exposure on the metabolic phenotype of the offspring during adulthood in mice.
Metformin (300 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered orally to dams on regular diet from the embryonic day E0.5 to E17.5. Gene expression profiles in liver and brain were analysed from 4-day old offspring by microarray. Body weight development and several metabolic parameters of offspring were monitored both during regular diet (RD-phase) and high fat diet (HFD-phase). At the end of the study, two doses of metformin or vehicle were given acutely to mice at the age of 20 weeks, and Insig-1 and GLUT4 mRNA expressions in liver and fat tissue were analysed using qRT-PCR.
Metformin exposed fetuses were lighter at E18.5. There was no effect of metformin on the maternal body weight development or food intake. Metformin exposed offspring gained more body weight and mesenteric fat during the HFD-phase. The male offspring also had impaired glucose tolerance and elevated fasting glucose during the HFD-phase. Moreover, the expression of GLUT4 mRNA was down-regulated in epididymal fat in male offspring prenatally exposed to metformin. Based on the microarray and subsequent qRT-PCR analyses, the expression of Insig-1 was changed in the liver of neonatal mice exposed to metformin prenatally. Furthermore, metformin up-regulated the expression of Insig-1 later in development. Gene set enrichment analysis based on preliminary microarray data identified several differentially enriched pathways both in control and metformin exposed mice.
The present study shows that prenatal metformin exposure causes long-term programming effects on the metabolic phenotype during high fat diet in mice. This should be taken into consideration when using metformin as a therapeutic agent during pregnancy.
The purpose of this study was to review the use of lithium in pregnancy and its effects on the neonate. This was a case study and review of the published literature. Lithium is commonly used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, specifically bipolar depression. Bipolar disorders that require treatment with lithium demand special consideration when the woman becomes pregnant. Reported neonatal problems with maternal lithium therapy include Ebstein's anomaly, poor respiratory effort and cyanosis, rhythm disturbances, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction, hypoglycemia, hypotonia and lethargy, hyperbilirubinemia, and large-for-gestational-age infants. Lithium can have adverse effects on the fetus and newborn infant, but data suggest normal behavioral patterns in childhood.
Valproic acid is a carboxylic acid used for the treatment of both seizure and mood disorders. Its association with pleural fluid eosinophilia has been reported once in the English language literature. We present another case of valproic acid-induced pleural fluid eosinophilia associated with fever and peripheral blood eosinophilia. Extensive evaluation failed to reveal any other cause of eosinophilic pleural effusion, and the effusion resolved with discontinuance of valproic acid. Rechallenge with valproic acid produced recurrent symptoms. Valproic acid should be considered a possible cause of eosinophilic pleural effusion.
The prognosis of peritoneal spread from gastrointestinal cancer and subsequent malignant ascites is poor, and current medical treatments available are mostly ineffective. Targeted chemotherapy with intraperitoneal prodrug activation may be a beneficial new approach. L293 cells were genetically modified to express the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2B1 under the control of a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. This CYP2B1 enzyme converts ifosfamide to its active cytotoxic compounds. The cells are encapsulated in a cellulose sulfate formulation (Capcell). Adult Balb/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 10(6) colon 26 cancer cells, previously transfected with GFP to emit a stable green fluorescence, by injection into the left lower abdominal quadrant. Two or five day's later animals were randomly subjected to either i.p. treatment with ifosfamide alone or ifosfamide combined with microencapsulated CYP2B1-expressing cells. Peritoneal tumor volume and tumor viability were assessed 10 days after tumor inoculation by means of fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy and histology. Early i.p. treatment with ifosfamide and CYP2B1 cells resulted in a complete response. Treatment starting on day 5 and single-drug treatment with ifosfamide resulted in a partial response. These results suggest that targeted i.p. chemotherapy using a combination of a prodrug and its converting enzyme may be a successful treatment strategy for peritoneal spread from colorectal cancer.
The physiological basis for the polyuria and polydipsia occurring in some manic-depressive patients treated with lithium salts was studied in vivo and in vitro. Three lithium-treated polyuric patients, in whom other causes of a concentrating defect were excluded, had abnormal urinary concentrating abilities after a standard water depreviation test. Two of these patients failed to respond to exogenous vasopressin (ADH) and one had a subnormal response. The abilities of these patients to excrete solute-free water (C(H2O)) was comparable to normal subjects during steady-state water diuresis, suggesting no gross abnormalities in sodium transport. However, each of these patients demonstrated abnormally low capacities to reabsorb solute-free water (T(C) (H2O)) under hydropenic conditions after administration of hypertonic saline and vasopressin. These in vivo findings demonstrate at least a nephrogenic basis for the diabetes insipidus syndrome manifested by these three patients. The defect in water transport was further characterized in toad urinary bladders in vitro. Short-circuit current (I) and water flow (W) were studied under basal, ADH-stimulated, and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (c-AMP)-stimulated conditions. Increasing mucosal [Li(+)] progressively inhibited basal I, and both I and W induced by ADH. Significant inhibition of basal and ADH-induced I was observed at mucosal [Li(+)] < 1.1 mEq/liter, and of ADH-induced W at mucosal [Li(+)] = 11 mEq/liter. On the other hand, at these lithium concentrations, neither c-AMP-stimulated W nor I was inhibited. Increasing serosal [Li(+)] produced significant inhibition of basal I only at [Li(+)] at least 50-fold greater than at the mucosal (urinary) surface. These in vitro studies confirm that mucosal lithium inhibits the action of ADH, but not c-AMP. Hence, lithium appears to be a significant inhibitor of ADH-stimulated water flow, probably acts from the urinary surface, and appears to exert its effect at a site biochemically proximal to c-AMP action.
To assess the cost-effectiveness of liver biopsy in monitoring rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients for methotrexate (MTX)-induced cirrhosis.
A decision analytic model was used to compare a strategy of no biopsy versus strategies of biopsy after 5 years or 10 years of MTX treatment.
Biopsy after 5 years of MTX treatment had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,891,830 per year of life saved, while biopsy after 10 years of treatment had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $52,374 per year of life saved. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the cost-effectiveness of biopsy was most dependent on the probability of cirrhosis.
Liver biopsy to monitor for MTX-induced cirrhosis in RA patients is not cost effective after 5 years of treatment, and even biopsy after 10 years has a high cost.
Three anaesthetic premedication regimens have been compared by double-blind controlled trial in 158 patients undergoing day-case surgery for varicose veins or hernia. Atropine plus droperidol was superior to atropine plus diazepam or atropine alone in lessening nausea and vomiting and in reducing the need for postoperative analgesia.
New antibiotic pumilacidins A, B, C, D, E, F and G were isolated from the culture broth of a strain of Bacillus pumilus. They are cyclic acylheptapeptide composed of a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, two L-leucine, two D-leucine, L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid and L-isoleucine (or L-valine). Pumilacidin components were inhibitory to herpes simplex virus type 1 and H+, K(+)-ATPase and demonstrated antiulcer activity in rat.
Insulin resistance and hypertension are present in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a fructose-enriched diet. In these rats, insulin might elevate blood pressure via an antinatriuretic action.
To investigate the sodium-insulin interaction in fructose-fed rats, we compared insulin sensitivity, insulin receptor binding, and insulin receptor mRNA levels in the kidney and skeletal muscle of rats that were fed standard rat chow or a fructose-enriched diet (66%) with either low (0.07%), normal (0.3%), or high (7.5%) NaCl concentrations for 3 weeks.
Systolic blood pressure increased in the fructose-fed rats receiving the normal and high-salt diet, but not the low-salt diet. When the rats were fed the low-salt diet, the rate of glucose infusion required to maintain euglycemia during a hyperinsulinemic clamp and insulin receptor number and mRNA levels in skeletal muscle were lower in fructose-fed than control rats. High-salt diet decreased significantly the rate of glucose disposal during the clamp and muscular insulin receptor number and mRNA levels in control, but not fructose-fed rats. During the low-salt diet, renal insulin receptor number and mRNA levels were comparable in fructose-fed and control rats and hyperinsulinemia had comparable acute antinatriuretic effects in the two groups; when the rats were maintained on the high-salt diet, the expected decrease in renal insulin receptor number and mRNA levels occurred in control but not fructose-fed rats and, consistent with this finding, the antinatriuretic response to hyperinsulinemia was blunted only in controls. An inverse relationship between dietary NaCl content and renal insulin receptor mRNA levels was observed in control but not fructose-fed rats.
Fructose-fed rats appear to have lost the feedback mechanism that limits insulin-induced sodium retention through a down-regulation of the renal insulin receptor when the dietary NaCl content is increased. This abnormality might possibly contribute to the elevation of blood pressure in these rats.
1. Bream (Abramis brama) were exposed to sublethal concentration of organophosphorus insecticide DDVP and the amount of food consumed and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) examined in exposed fish. 2. Exposure to DDVP resulted in decreased amount of food consumed and inhibited brain AChE activity. 3. Intraperitoneal injection of the fish with cholinergic drugs, atropine and TMB-4 recovered the feeding efficiency in exposed fish. TMB-4 recovered brain AChE activity as well. 4. The results revealed that cholinergic system in fish brain constitutes biochemical mechanism controlling feeding behavior in fish.
