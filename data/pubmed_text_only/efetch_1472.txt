A bioassay for possible carcinogenicity of technical-grade 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone was conducted using Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. 1-Amino-2-methylanthraquinone was administered in the feed, at either of two concentrations, to groups of 45 to 50 males and females of each species. The high and low time-weighted average concentrations of 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone were 0.20 and 0.10 percent, respectively, for male and female rats. For mice, two dosage regimens (designated A and B) were used, but the time-weighted average concentrations were the same, 0.06 percent. For each species, 50 animals of each sex were placed on test as controls. The period of compound administration was 78 weeks for rats followed by 26 to 28 additional weeks of observation, and 73 weeks for mice followed by 24 to 25 additional weeks of observation. A statistically significant positive association between compound administration and mortality was established for the male and female dose A mice. Dose A mice did not survive sufficiently long to be at risk from late-developing tumors. Survival in all other groups was adequate. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was statistically significant among dosed rats of both sexes. Kidney neoplasms (the combined incidence of tubular-celladenomas, tubular-cell adenocarcinomas, and adenocarcinomas NOS) were significantly increased among dosed male rats. Administration of the compound was associated with a significant increase in the combined incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and neoplastic liver nodules in female mice. No other neoplasms occurred in statistically significant positive incidences in male or female mice. 1-Amino-2-methylanthraquinone demonstrated nephrotoxic properties in mice of both sexes. Under the conditions of this bioassay, 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone was carcinogenic in Fischer 344 rats, inducing hepatocellular carcinomas in rats of both sexes, and kidney tumors in male rats. The compound was carcinogenic in female B6C3F1 mice, producing an increased combined incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and neoplastic nodules.
1. Serum, tissue and urine angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was estimated in the following groups of rats: saline-injected rats (controls); captopril-treated (CAP) control animals (CONTROL-CAP); puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome (NS); and CAP-treated animals with NS (NS-CAP). 2. Serum ACE activity increased in the CONTROL-CAP, NS, and NS-CAP groups. The increase in the NS-CAP group was significantly higher compared with the NS or CONTROL-CAP groups. 3. In the CONTROL-CAP group, tissue ACE decreased in brain, heart and adrenal glands, and remained unchanged in the lung, testis, kidney, small intestine and liver. In the NS group, tissue ACE activity increased in the lung and testis, decreased in the brain and heart, and remained unchanged in the small intestine, adrenal glands, kidney and liver. Tissue ACE activity increased significantly in the NS-CAP group compared with the other groups. This increase in tissue ACE may contribute to an increase in the serum ACE activity in the NS-CAP group compared with the NS group. 4. Urine ACE activity increased in the NS and NS-CAP groups, although the rise in the NS-CAP group was significantly higher. The urine ACE correlated significantly with the circulating levels of this enzyme in the NS and NS-CAP groups. The loss of ACE in the urine in the presence of an increased serum ACE activity indicates that the biosynthesis of tissue ACE and its release into the bloodstream must be elevated.
In the pharmaceutical industry, improving the early detection of drug-induced hepatotoxicity is essential as it is one of the most important reasons for attrition of candidate drugs during the later stages of drug development. The first objective of this study was to better characterize different cellular models (i.e., HepG2, HepaRG cells, and fresh primary human hepatocytes) at the gene expression level and analyze their metabolic cytochrome P450 capabilities. The cellular models were exposed to three different CYP450 inducers; beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), phenobarbital (PB), and rifampicin (RIF). HepG2 cells responded very weakly to the different inducers at the gene expression level, and this translated generally into low CYP450 activities in the induced cells compared with the control cells. On the contrary, HepaRG cells and the three human donors were inducible after exposure to BNF, PB, and RIF according to gene expression responses and CYP450 activities. Consequently, HepaRG cells could be used in screening as a substitute and/or in complement to primary hepatocytes for CYP induction studies. The second objective was to investigate the predictivity of the different cellular models to detect hepatotoxins (16 hepatotoxic and 5 nonhepatotoxic compounds). Specificity was 100% with the different cellular models tested. Cryopreserved human hepatocytes gave the highest sensitivity, ranging from 31% to 44% (depending on the donor), followed by lower sensitivity (13%) for HepaRG and HepG2 cells (6.3%). Overall, none of the models under study gave desirable sensitivities (80-100%). Consequently, a high metabolic capacity and CYP inducibility in cell lines does not necessarily correlate with a high sensitivity for the detection of hepatotoxic drugs. Further investigations are necessary to compare different cellular models and determine those that are best suited for the detection of hepatotoxic compounds.
It was hypothesized that the metabolic effects of caffeine, which can be objectively measured (i.e. physiological, "arousal"), could be used to develop a physiological arousal model of chronic insomnia in a group of normal young adults. Twelve normal young adult males participated for 11 nights after laboratory adaptation. Subjects received 400 mg of caffeine three times a day for 7 nights and days. As predicted, the use of caffeine resulted in increased metabolic rate. Sleep efficiency was significantly reduced by caffeine and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) were significantly increased. Some adaptation to the metabolic, sleep efficiency, and MSLT effects of caffeine was seen over the week of administration. Withdrawal effects (i.e. rebound sleep or sleepiness) were not seen for metabolic, MSLT or sleep variables. The data indicated that caffeine was effective in producing significant metabolic and sleep effects and that those effects were related. The results were consistent with the interpretation that a chronic decrease in sleep efficiency associated with increased physiological arousal, although producing subjective dysphoria, does not produce a physiological sleep debt.
A patient who used oral contraceptives who had had a partial hepatectomy for benign hepatic cell adenoma became pregnant 3 years after surgery. No diagnosed liver complicaions resulted during the pregnancy or the postpartum period.
Cocaine abuse has been associated with pathologic cardiovascular events including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sudden death. Although coronary vasospasm has been proposed as a possible mechanism, the ability of cocaine to induce coronary spasm has not been conclusively demonstrated. In these studies, isolated rat hearts were perfused with cocaine (100 micrograms to 500 micrograms/ml) for 1 minute, perfusion-fixed with glutaraldehyde, and histologically assessed for evidence of coronary spasm through light and electron microscopy. Light micrographs revealed that cocaine induced spasm in coronary arterioles up to 65 microns in diameter, whereas larger caliber vessels did not constrict. Ultrastructurally, vacuolation was observed in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of constricted arterioles. Endothelial integrity was maintained and interendothelial junctions remained intact. Morphologic evidence of constriction was supported by data obtained from Langendorff-heart preparations in which cocaine reduced myocardial flow rate under constant pressure conditions and increased aortic perfusion pressure under constant flow conditions. Spasm induced by cocaine was prevented by the calcium entry blocker nitrendipine, but not by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. The finding of small vessel spasm in this study may explain the significant number of clinical cases of cocaine-associated AMI in which the main coronary arteries appear angiographically normal.
Gene expression profiling is a widely used technique with data from the majority of published microarray studies being publicly available. These data are being used for meta-analyses and in silico discovery; however, the comparability of toxicogenomic data generated in multiple laboratories has not been critically evaluated. Using the power of prospective multilaboratory investigations, seven centers individually conducted a common toxicogenomics experiment designed to advance understanding of molecular pathways perturbed in liver by an acute toxic dose of N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP) and to uncover reproducible genomic signatures of APAP-induced toxicity. The nonhepatotoxic APAP isomer N-acetyl-m-aminophenol was used to identify gene expression changes unique to APAP. Our data show that c-Myc is induced by APAP and that c-Myc-centered interactomes are the most significant networks of proteins associated with liver injury. Furthermore, sources of error and data variability among Centers and methods to accommodate this variability were identified by coupling gene expression with extensive toxicological evaluation of the toxic responses. We show that phenotypic anchoring of gene expression data is required for biologically meaningful analysis of toxicogenomic experiments.
Brain tumours are often disabling and rapidly lethal; their aetiology is largely unknown. Among potential risk factors, pesticides are suspected.
To examine the relationship between exposure to pesticides and brain tumours in adults in a population-based case-control study in southwestern France.
Between May 1999 and April 2001, 221 incident cases of brain tumours and 442 individually matched controls selected from the general population were enrolled. Histories of occupational and environmental exposures, medical and lifestyle information were collected. A cumulative index of occupational exposure to pesticides was created, based on expert review of lifelong jobs and tasks. Separate analyses were performed for gliomas and meningiomas.
A non-statistically significant increase in risk was found for brain tumours when all types of occupational exposure to pesticides were considered (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.91) and slightly higher but still non-statistically significant when gliomas were considered separately (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.66). In the highest quartile of the cumulative index, a significant association was found for brain tumours (OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.23) and for gliomas (OR = 3.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 9.11), but not for meningiomas. A significant increase in risk was also seen for the treatment of home plants (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.30) owing to environmental exposure to pesticides.
These data suggest that a high level of occupational exposure to pesticides might be associated with an excess risk of brain tumours, and especially of gliomas.
Anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents of the topoisomerase inhibitor family are widely used for the treatment of various tumors. Although targeted tumor tissues are generally situated in a hypoxic environment, the connection between efficacy of anthracycline agents and cellular hypoxia response has not been investigated in depth. Here, we report that doxorubicin (DXR) impairs the transcriptional response of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by inhibiting the binding of the HIF heterodimer to the consensus -RCGTG- enhancer element. This pleiotropic effect retarded migration of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective renal cell carcinoma and that of VHL-competent renal cell carcinoma in hypoxia. This effect was accompanied by a coordinated down-regulation of HIF target lysyl oxidase (LOX) family members LOX, LOX-like2 (LOXL2), and LOXL4. Furthermore, DXR suppressed HIF target genes in tumor xenografts, inhibited cardiac induction of HIF targets in rats with acute anemia, and impaired the angiogenic response in the isoproterenol-induced heart failure model, which may account for the clinical fragility of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy. Collectively, these findings highlight the impaired hypoxia response by anthracycline agents affecting both tumors and organs of the cancer host and offer a promising opportunity to develop HIF inhibitors using DXR as a chemical template.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the pathological findings and perform morphometric analysis of the renal arteries of fetuses exposed to cocaine in utero. The control group consisted of 22 stillborn fetuses of unknown etiology whose mothers' urine was negative for cocaine or any other vasoactive substances. The study group comprised 29 stillborn fetuses whose mothers' urine was positive only for cocaine on the day of admission. Sections of fetal kidneys (4 microm), stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff reagent, were examined under light microscopy (x40) to identify interlobular arteries. Morphometric analysis of these arteries was performed using a self-assembled system with a touch-sensitive screen as an interactive peripheral. Their inner and outer circumferences were measured by outlining them on the screen with a stylus. The radius (r) was calculated from the measurement of the circumference (2.pi.r). The difference of the radii of the outer and inner circumferences was the thickness of the arterial wall. The interlobular arterial thickness was significantly greater (P<0.001) in the cocaine-exposed group (mean 15.46+/-5.8 microm, 2SD) compared with the normal (mean 9.03+/-3.96 microm, 2SD). There was a significantly (P<0.001) positive relation with advancing gestational ages in both groups. The circumferences of the lumen of the arteries showed a significant (P<0.05) relation with advancing gestational ages in the normal group only. In the cocaine-exposed group, the arterial lumen circumference (mean 167.88+/-17.58 microm, 2SD) was significantly (P<0.001) smaller than in the normal group (mean 227.73+/-6.82 microm, 2SD). Thus, maternal cocaine abuse is associated with thickening of the interlobular arterial wall of the fetal kidney and narrowing of the lumen.
The immediate transition from positive pressure mechanical ventilation to spontaneous ventilation may generate significant cardiopulmonary hemodynamic alterations based on the mode of weaning selected, particularly in individuals with preexisting cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to compare hemodynamic responses associated with the initial transition to 3 modes of ventilator weaning (spontaneous ventilation/T-piece, pressure support [PS], and continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]). Right ventricular hemodynamic responses were evaluated with a thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter; while left ventricular hemodynamic responses were measured by a transducer-tipped Millar catheter and conductance catheter. Two groups of canines were studied. Group 1: normal biventricular function (n = 10) and group 2: propranolol-induced biventricular failure (n = 10). Dependent variables were measured at baseline on controlled mechanical ventilation (MV) and following the initial transition to each of 3 randomized spontaneous ventilatory conditions: T-piece, PS 5 cmH2O, and CPAP 5 cmH2O. Both groups significantly increased cardiac output in response to T-piece. Right ventricular stroke work was also significantly increased with T-piece and CPAP in both groups of subjects. Left ventricular response depended on baseline ventricular function. Baseline ventricular function influenced hemodynamic response to the immediate transition from mechanical to spontaneous ventilation. There were also differential hemodynamic responses based on the ventilatory mode. Consideration of baseline cardiac function may be an important factor in the selection of an appropriate mode of spontaneous ventilation following controlled MV.
The purpose of this study was to determine the neurotoxicity of two commonly used herbicides: picloram and triclopyr and the neuroprotective effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, SS31. Using mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells and primary neurons from C57BL/6 mice, we investigated the toxicity of these herbicides, and protective effects of SS1 peptide against picloram and triclopyr toxicity. We measured total RNA content, cell viability and mRNA expression of peroxiredoxins, neuroprotective genes, mitochondrial-encoded electron transport chain (ETC) genes in N2a cells treated with herbicides and SS31. Using primary neurons from C57BL/6 mice, neuronal survival was studied in neurons treated with herbicides, in neurons pretreated with SS31 plus treated with herbicides, neurons treated with SS31 alone, and untreated neurons. Significantly decreased total RNA content, and cell viability in N2a cells treated with picloram and triclopyr were found compared to untreated N2a cells. Decreased mRNA expression of neuroprotective genes, and ETC genes in cells treated with herbicides was found compared to untreated cells. Decreased mRNA expression of peroxiredoxins 1-6 in N2a cells treated with picloram was found, suggesting that picloram affects the antioxidant enzymes in N2a cells. Immunofluorescence analysis of primary neurons revealed that decreased neuronal branching and degenerating neurons in neurons treated with picloram and triclopyr. However, neurons pretreated with SS31 prevented degenerative process caused by herbicides. Based on these results, we propose that herbicides--picloram and triclopyr appear to damage neurons, and the SS31 peptide appears to protect neurons from herbicide toxicity.
This open, prospective, randomized trial aimed to assess the effects of statins in chronic kidney disease patients on optimized antiproteinuric treatment with combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade.
After 1-month benazepril therapy followed by 1-month benazepril-valsartan combined therapy (run-in), 186 consenting patients with residual proteinuria >0.5 g/24 h were randomized to 6-month benazepril-valsartan therapy alone or combined with fluvastatin. Between-groups changes in proteinuria (primary outcome), serum lipids, and GFR were compared by ANCOVA. Analyses were blinded and by intention to treat.
During the run-in, proteinuria decreased more on benazepril-valsartan than on benazepril alone. Proteinuria reduction correlated with concomitant reduction in total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A levels. After randomization, median proteinuria similarly decreased from 1.2 (0.6 to 2.2) to 1.1 (0.5 to 1.7) g/24 h on fluvastatin and from 1.5 (0.8 to 2.7) to 1.0 (0.5 to 2.4) g/24 h on benazapril-valsartan therapy alone. Fluvastatin further reduced total and LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B versus benazepril-valsartan alone, but did not affect serum triglycerides and GFR. Treatment was well tolerated.
In chronic kidney disease patients with residual proteinuria despite combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockade therapy, add-on fluvastatin does not affect urinary proteins, but further reduces serum lipids and is safe. Whether combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blockade, and statin therapy may improve cardiovascular outcomes in this high-risk population is worth investigating.
To assess the health risks associated with exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodebenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), we studied the effects of a relatively low dose of TCDD on the male reproductive system of rats, using the experimental protocol of T. A. Mably et al. (1992, Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 114, 97-107, 108-117, 118-126), and searched for the most sensitive and reliable among several indices of TCDD toxicity. Pregnant Holtzman rats were given a single oral dose of 0, 12.5, 50, 200, or 800 ng TCDD/kg body weight on gestational day (GD) 15, and male offspring were sacrificed on postnatal day (PND) 49 or 120. GC-MS analysis of the abdominal fat tissue and testis clearly showed increased amounts of TCDD in these offspring. However, there was no TCDD effect on body weight of offspring. There were no changes on testicular or epididymal weights by TCDD administration, even at the 800-ng/kg dose in rats sacrificed on either PND 49 or 120. In addition, TCDD administration resulted in no changes in daily sperm production or sperm reserve at any of the doses used. However, the weight of the urogenital complex, including the ventral prostate, was significantly reduced at doses of 200 and 800 ng TCDD/kg in rats sacrificed on PND 120. Moreover, the anogenital distance (AGD) of male rats sacrificed on PND 120 showed a significant decrease in the groups receiving doses greater than 50 ng TCDD/kg. TCDD administration resulted in no apparent dose-dependent changes in levels of either serum testosterone or luteinizing hormone. Interestingly, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that, in the ventral prostates of the PND 49 group, TCDD administration resulted in both a dose-dependent increase in 5alpha-reductase type 2 (5alphaR-II) mRNA level and a dose-dependent decrease in androgen receptor (AR) mRNA level. These results suggest that low-dose TCDD administration had a greater effect on the development of the external genital organs and ventral prostate than on development of the testis and other internal genital organs. Moreover, it is highly suggested that the decrease in the size of the ventral prostate by maternal TCDD exposure might be due to decreased responsiveness of the prostate to androgen due to an insufficient expression level of androgen receptor during puberty.
Torasemide (torsemide) is a high-ceiling loop diuretic which acts on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle to promote rapid and marked excretion of water, sodium and chloride. Like furosemide (frusemide), its major site of action is from the luminal side of the cell. Torasemide is at least twice as potent as furosemide on a weight-for-weight basis, produces equivalent diuresis and natriuresis at lower urinary concentrations and has a longer duration of action, allowing once-daily administration without the paradoxical antidiuresis seen with furosemide. Torasemide also appears to promote excretion of potassium and calcium to a lesser extent than furosemide. In trials of up to 48 weeks' duration in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, torasemide, administered as a single daily dose, has been shown to achieve adequate blood pressure control reaching steady-state within 8 to 12 weeks. Those patients not responding initially have generally responded to a doubling of the dose. Comparative trials of up to 6 months show torasemide is as effective as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide or a combination of triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide in maintaining control of blood pressure. Torasemide has also been used successfully to treat oedematous states associated with chronic congestive heart failure, renal disease and hepatic cirrhosis. In short term trials control of blood pressure, bodyweight and residual oedema has been sustained. Torasemide appears to be a useful alternative to furosemide in these patients, providing potent and long-lasting diuresis while being relatively potassium and calcium sparing. In clinical trials to date torasemide has been well tolerated with adverse effects of a mild, transient nature reported by only small numbers of patients. Changes in biochemical parameters have been common, including decreases in plasma sodium and potassium levels and increases in plasma creatinine and uric acid levels. These changes are typical of loop diuretics. No changes were clinically significant nor were clinically relevant changes noted in glucose metabolism, cholesterol or triglyceride levels or in haematological values. Thus, torasemide is an interesting new loop diuretic with potential use in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension and of oedematous states in which diuretic therapy is warranted. Preliminary studies suggest it to be as efficacious as other diuretics in common use and to have some advantage over furosemide in duration of action and in effects on potassium and calcium. However, further long term trials in larger groups of patients are needed to delineate the place of torasemide in therapy fully, both as a single agent and in combination with other currently accepted drug regimens.
A 71-year-old woman, admitted for chest pain, received a 5 mg dose of isosorbide dinitrate sublingually. Within 2 min she became pale and diaphoretic and soon after lost consciousness. A monitor electrocardiographic lead showed sinus bradycardia followed by ventricular asystole. Sinus rhythm was restored by a precordial thump and intravenous administration of atropine. Our patient was receiving lidocaine intravenously because of ventricular premature beats. Its interaction with isosorbide is suspected of having caused the asystole.
The side-effect profile of quinolone antibiotics in man includes CNS disturbances such as dizziness, insomnia and convulsions. Although it has been suggested that the proconvulsive liability of quinolones involves an interaction with GABA receptors in the central nervous system, no animal model has been described to evaluate or confirm the mechanism of this effect. The proconvulsive activity of the quinolone antibiotics, nalidixic (NAL) and oxolinic (OXO) acid were tested in male mice following oral doses of 10-100 mg/kg utilizing the convulsive stimuli pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), picrotoxin, strychnine or electroshock. While NAL and OXO did not alter the threshold for convulsions induced by PTZ, strychnine or picrotoxin, both agents lowered the threshold for electroshock-induced seizures. Furthermore, the proconvulsive actions of NAL and OXO were completely blocked by the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists, MK-801 and 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (AP-4). These data indicate that the mechanism of convulsive liability of quinolone antibiotics does not involve GABA receptor interactions as previously thought, but appears to involve activation of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors, possibly located in the optic region of the central nervous system.
The oncogene erbB-2 codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase that functions as a key mitotic signal in a variety of cell types. Amplification or overexpression of erbB-2 occurs in many forms of cancer, such as of the breast, colon, and prostate, and is an indicator of poor prognosis in those diseases. In the human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3, erbB-2 kinase was activated by pesticides of different chemical classes: (1) the organochlorine insecticides beta-hexa-chlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH), o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o,p'-DDT), and heptachlor epoxide; (2) the pyrethroid insecticide trans-permethrin, and (3) the fungicide chlorothalonil. o,p'-DDT also causes phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cellular proliferation of the androgen-dependent LNCaP line. However, no proliferative effect was observed in the androgen-independent PC-3 line. The proliferative effect of o,p'-DDT in LNCaP could not be blocked by the androgen receptor antagonist p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (p,p'-DDE), indicating that this effect of o,p'-DDT does not occur through direct interaction with the androgen receptor. Together these data demonstrate a putative mechanism for the action of certain pesticides in hormonal carcinogenesis.
Household cleaning and pesticide products may contribute to breast cancer because many contain endocrine disrupting chemicals or mammary gland carcinogens. This population-based case-control study investigated whether use of household cleaners and pesticides increases breast cancer risk.
Participants were 787 Cape Cod, Massachusetts, women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1988 and 1995 and 721 controls. Telephone interviews asked about product use, beliefs about breast cancer etiology, and established and suspected breast cancer risk factors. To evaluate potential recall bias, we stratified product-use odds ratios by beliefs about whether chemicals and pollutants contribute to breast cancer; we compared these results with odds ratios for family history (which are less subject to recall bias) stratified by beliefs about heredity.
Breast cancer risk increased two-fold in the highest compared with lowest quartile of self-reported combined cleaning product use (Adjusted OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4, 3.3) and combined air freshener use (Adjusted OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.0). Little association was observed with pesticide use. In stratified analyses, cleaning products odds ratios were more elevated among participants who believed pollutants contribute "a lot" to breast cancer and moved towards the null among the other participants. In comparison, the odds ratio for breast cancer and family history was markedly higher among women who believed that heredity contributes "a lot" (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.9, 3.6) and not elevated among others (OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.1).
Results of this study suggest that cleaning product use contributes to increased breast cancer risk. However, results also highlight the difficulty of distinguishing in retrospective self-report studies between valid associations and the influence of recall bias. Recall bias may influence higher odds ratios for product use among participants who believed that chemicals and pollutants contribute to breast cancer. Alternatively, the influence of experience on beliefs is another explanation, illustrated by the protective odds ratio for family history among women who do not believe heredity contributes "a lot." Because exposure to chemicals from household cleaning products is a biologically plausible cause of breast cancer and avoidable, associations reported here should be further examined prospectively.
Congenital or childhood cataract is clinically and genetically a highly heterogeneous lens disorder in children. Autosomal dominant inheritance is most common.
To report the identification of a mutation in the human CRYGS gene.
A large six generation family affected by progressive polymorphic cortical cataract was investigated. After excluding loci for known cataract candidate genes using 39 fluorescent microsatellite markers, a whole genome scan was carried out.
The disease was associated with inheritance of a 20.7 cM locus on chromosome 3q26.3-qter, with a maximum LOD score of 6.34 (theta = 0) at marker D3S1602. Haplotype analysis indicated that the disease gene lay at approximately 2.8 Mb physical intervals between D3S1571 and D3S3570 and contained CRYGS on 3q27.3. By sequencing the CRYGS gene, a distinct 1619G-->T (AC068631) heterozygous missense mutation in exon 2 was identified, co-segregating with the disease phenotype in this family and resulting in a glycine (GGC) to valine residue (GTC) substitution in codon 18 (NP_060011).
This report is the first description of a mutation in CRYGS with autosomal dominant cataract in humans.
Intracarotid administration of carmustine (BCNU) is an increasingly accepted therapeutic modality for primary brain tumors. Its beneficial effect on prolonging survival, however, is countered by its frequent delayed complication of retinal toxicity and severe visual loss, which reportedly occurs in approximately 70% of the patients. Since this complication probably results from increased flow of the drug into the ophthalmic artery, the authors have attempted to infuse BCNU via a small intracarotid catheter advanced beyond the origin of the ophthalmic artery. In a series of nine patients (average follow-ups, 10.7 months), the authors were successful in treating six patients with exclusively supraophthalmic infusions. None of these patients developed any ocular toxicity. From the remaining three patients, two patients received one infraophthalmic infusion with no retinal toxicity. The third patient, however, who received three infraophthalmic infusions, developed ipsilateral retinopathy. These results suggest that retinopathic complications of intracarotid BCNU can be avoided if the infusion catheter is advanced beyond the origin of the ophthalmic artery.
With the recent withdrawal of the antifibrinolytic aprotinin from the market, tranexamic acid (TxA) has become more widely used. This change has led to increasing concern about the side-effect profile of TxA, particularly the incidence of postoperative seizures. In this case series, we describe 7 patients over an 18-month period who had open-chamber cardiac surgery and developed seizures in the postoperative period. This incidence is increased compared with that of a cohort of patients in the previous 36 months who did not receive TxA (0.66% versus 0%; P < .05). The exact mechanism of TxA-induced seizures is thought to be via inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors in neurons. Data from the neurosurgical literature show a well-established link between this antifibrinolytic and seizures. There is now increasing awareness of this association in cardiac surgery, particularly when high TxA doses are used.
Convulsions, neuronal morphology, brain phosphoinositide (PI) signaling, and calcium levels were studied in rats 1, 4, and 72 hr after malaoxon (MO; 26.2 or 39.2 mg/kg ip) subsequent to pretreatment with saline or LiCl (10 meq/kg ip). The high dose of MO induced convulsions in 60% of the rats whereas the low dose was ineffective. In nonconvulsing rats, MO transiently increased cerebral inositol 1-phosphate (Ins1P), an intermediate in PI cycle, but consistently elevated brain Ins1P in convulsing rats. LiCl did not induce convulsions, but elevated the resting level of Ins1P and decreased that of inositol. Lithium also increased the potential of MO to cause convulsions but attenuated MO-induced elevations of Ins1P. Moreover, total Ca2+ in cortex increased in LiCl-pretreated convulsing and nonconvulsing rats after MO. Astrocytic edema and cytoplasmic vacuolation and/or shrinkage of neurons in cortical layers 2-3 and in the hippocampus as well as in some subcortical structures occurred only in convulsing rats. These results suggest that PI signaling may be involved in convulsions and contribute to the early neuronal injury. Cerebral Ca2+ elevations seemed to precede permanent neuronal injury. A target other than the inhibition of the hydrolysis of inositol phosphates may be the site of lithium's action in cholinergic convulsions.
We have previously demonstrated that administration of various benzoquinol-glutathione (GSH) conjugates to rats causes renal proximal tubular necrosis and the initial lesion appears to lie within that portion of the S3 segment within the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OSOM). The toxicity may be a consequence of oxidation of the quinol conjugate to the quinone followed by covalent binding to tissue macromolecules. We have therefore synthesized the GSH and N-acetylcysteine conjugates of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione) and 1,4-naphthoquinone. The resulting conjugates have certain similarities to the benzoquinol-GSH conjugates, but the main difference is that reaction with the thiol yields a conjugate which remains in the quinone form. 2-Methyl-3-(N-acetylcystein-S-yl)-1,4-naphthoquinone caused a dose-dependent (50-200 mumol/kg) necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelium. The lesion involved the terminal portion of the S2 segment and the S3 segment within the medullary ray. At the lower doses, that portion of the S3 segment in the outer stripe of the outer medulla displayed no evidence of necrosis. In contrast, 2-methyl-3-(glutathion-S-yl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (200 mumol/kg) caused no apparent histological alterations to the kidney. 2-(Glutathion-S-yl)-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-(diglutathion-S-yl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (200 mumol/kg) were relatively weak proximal tubular toxicants and the lesion involved the S3 segment at the junction of the medullary ray and the OSOM. A possible reason(s) for the striking difference in the toxicity of the N-acetylcysteine conjugate of menadione, as opposed to the lack of toxicity of the GSH conjugate of menadione, is discussed. The basis for the localization of the lesion caused by 2-methyl-3-(N-acetylcystein-S-yl)-1,4-naphthoquinone requires further study.
Our pharmacologic armamentarium is expanding at a tremendous pace, and requires that we as clinicians maintain a certain level of knowledge of the drugs that we use, as well as their metabolism, and how they may function, both positively and negatively, in a given patient. Certain drugs, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, interfere with the natural deactivation of certain vasoactive substances normally present in the body. Since many of these systems are functionally interrelated (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme and kininase II), we may see cutaneous side effects when these drugs are administered. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that promoted a cutaneous eruption in a patient with renal failure secondary to diabetes. We suspect that our patient's vasculitis and maculopapular erythema is included in a large number of polymorphic eruptions that can be seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and review the operative pathogenetic mechanism. Many of these side effects are dose related, and can be controlled or eliminated by lowering the dosage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, depending upon the clinical circumstances.
