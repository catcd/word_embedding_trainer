Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder diagnosed in early childhood. Abnormalities of serotonergic neurotransmission have been reported in autism. Serotonin transporter (SERT) modulates serotonin levels, and is a major therapeutic target in autism. Factors that regulate SERT expression might be implicated in the pathophysiology of autism. One candidate SERT regulatory protein is the roundabout axon guidance molecule, ROBO. SerT expression in Drosophila is regulated by robo; it plays a vital role in mammalian neurodevelopment also. Here, we examined the associations of ROBO3 and ROBO4 with autism, in a trio association study using DNA from 252 families recruited to AGRE. Four SNPs of ROBO3 (rs3923890, P = 0.023; rs7925879, P = 0.017; rs4606490, P = 0.033; and rs3802905, P = 0.049) and a single SNP of ROBO4 (rs6590109, P = 0.009) showed associations with autism; the A/A genotype of rs3923890 showed lower ADI-R_A scores, which reflect social interaction. Significant haplotype associations were also observed for ROBO3 and ROBO4. We further compared the mRNA expressions of ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3, and ROBO4 in the lymphocytes of 19 drug-naïve autistic patients and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Expressions of ROBO1 (P = 0.018) and ROBO2 (P = 0.023) were significantly reduced in the autistic group; the possibility of using the altered expressions of ROBO as peripheral markers for autism, may be explored. In conclusion, we suggest a possible role of ROBO in the pathogenesis of autism. Abnormalities of ROBO may lead to autism either by interfering with serotonergic system, or by disrupting neurodevelopment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report relating ROBO with autism.
Amiodarone is reported to have a low incidence of proarrhythmic effects. They generally occur during chronic treatment in association with increase in amiodarone dosage, electrolyte disorders, or concomitant therapy with class IA antiarrhythmic drugs. We describe a case of amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes early after initiation of low-dose oral therapy, in absence of other predisposing factors.
Droperidol (DROP) is used in the emergency department (ED) for sedation, analgesia, and its antiemetic effect. Its ED safety profile has not yet been reported in patients (pts).
To document the use of DROP in high-risk pts (those with head injury, alcohol or cocaine intoxication, and/or remote or recent seizures), and to determine the number of serious and minor adverse events (AEs)-seizures, hypotension, extrapyramidal side effects (EPSEs)-after DROP.
The ED database (EmSTAT) was queried to determine who received intramuscular or intravenous DROP in the ED in 1998; further chart review was done if the patient was considered high risk for or had experienced an AE. Multiple regression analysis using a random-effects model determined the significance of each variable in the occurrence of AEs.
2,468 patients (aged 20 months to 98 years; 112 < or =17 years; 141 > or =66 years) received DROP for agitation (n = 1,357), pain (1,135), anxiety (99), vomiting (173), or other reasons (50). There were 945 pts considered high risk; 933 charts were reviewed (DROP mean dose 4.1 +/- 2.0 mg); of these, 50 patient visits did not meet the criteria for high risk. There were 622 pts with head trauma (401 with alcohol use), including 47 with computed tomography (CT) scans positive for brain injury, 64 with cocaine use, and 197 with recent or remote seizures (137 with alcohol use). Minor AEs such as transient hypotension occurred in 96 pts after DROP (73 with alcohol use); 20 received intravenous fluids, while an additional 28 pts (8 with alcohol use) received rescue medications for EPSEs. Six possible serious AEs occurred in pts with serious comorbidities; 2 cases of respiratory depression, 3 post-DROP seizures, and 1 cardiac arrest (resuscitated) 11 hours after DROP in a cocaine-intoxicated pt (normal QT interval). There was no significant difference among high-risk groups in the occurrence of AEs.
The vast majority of pts who received DROP in the ED did not experience an AE. A few serious AEs were noted following DROP in patients with serious comorbidities; it is not clear that DROP was causative.
The transcription factor IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) is required during an immune response for lymphocyte activation and the generation of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, has a complex molecular aetiology with several subgroups defined by gene expression profiling and recurrent chromosomal translocations. Moreover, the malignant clone can sustain multiple oncogenic lesions, accumulating genetic damage as the disease progresses. Current therapies for myeloma can extend survival but are not curative. Hence, new therapeutic strategies are needed that target molecular pathways shared by all subtypes of myeloma. Here we show, using a loss-of-function, RNA-interference-based genetic screen, that IRF4 inhibition is toxic to myeloma cell lines, regardless of transforming oncogenic mechanism. Gene expression profiling and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis uncovered an extensive network of IRF4 target genes and identified MYC as a direct target of IRF4 in activated B cells and myeloma. Unexpectedly, IRF4 was itself a direct target of MYC transactivation, generating an autoregulatory circuit in myeloma cells. Although IRF4 is not genetically altered in most myelomas, they are nonetheless addicted to an aberrant IRF4 regulatory network that fuses the gene expression programmes of normal plasma cells and activated B cells.
A phase II trial of alternating i.v. and oral vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin was designed to determine the response rate, safety profile, progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life (QoL) in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Fifty-six chemotherapy-naïve patients received cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) and i.v. vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) on day 1, followed by oral vinorelbine 60 mg/m(2) on days 8, 15 and 22, every 28 days.
After an independent review, the response rate was 33% [95% confidence interval (CI) 20% to 46%]. Median progression-free and overall survival were 5.5 months (95% CI 3.7-6.4) and 8.9 months (95% CI 8.8-11.7), respectively. The most frequent hematological toxicities were neutropenia (grade 3-4 in 73% of patients) and anemia (grade 3-4 in 11% of patients). Grade 3-4 infections and non-hematological toxicities occurred occasionally. QoL for lung cancer related symptoms was stable or improved.
The efficacy and safety of the alternating vinorelbine schedule (i.v. on day 1, oral on days 8, 15 and 22) in combination with cisplatin in advanced NSCLC are similar to those of the standard regimen using exclusively i.v. vinorelbine, whereas ease of administration and patient comfort may favor the novel approach.
To observe the effects of Qufengtongluo Recipe (QFTLR) on the expression of podocin mRNA and podocyte morphology in rats with adriamycin-induced nephropathy (AN), and explore the possible mechanism mediating the therapeutic effect of QFTLR on nephropathic proteinuria.
SD rats were randomized into normal control group, AN model group (established by a single injection of adriamycin via the tail vein), and 3 intervention groups with QFTLR, prednisone, or benazepril treatment. After the corresponding treatments, the expression of podocin mRNA in the renal tissues was detected by RT-PCR methods, and the morphological changes of the podocytes were examined by electron microscope.
Compared with the normal control group, the AN model group showed significantly lowered expressions of podocin mRNA (P<0.01) with reduced podocytes and widening, fusion or even absence of the foot processes (FP). Intervention with QFTLR significantly increased the expression of podocin mRNA (P<0.01) and the number of podocytes, and obviously lessened the structural changes of the FP.
QFTLR can produce therapeutic effect against nephropathic proteinuria possibly by up-regulating the expression of podocin mRNA and improving the morphological changes of the podocytes.
To find novel drugs for effective antifungal therapy in candidiasis, we examined disulfiram, a drug used for the treatment of alcoholism, for its role as a potential modulator of Candida multidrug transporter Cdr1p. We show that disulfiram inhibits the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity of Cdr1p and 2.5mM dithiothreitol reverses this inhibition. Disulfiram inhibited the binding of photoaffinity analogs of both ATP ([alpha-(32)P]8-azidoATP; IC(50)=0.76 microM) and drug-substrates ([(3)H]azidopine and [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin; IC(50) approximately 12 microM) to Cdr1p in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that it can interact with both ATP and substrate-binding site(s) of Cdr1p. Furthermore, a non-toxic concentration of disulfiram (1 microM) increased the sensitivity of Cdr1p expressing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to antifungal agents (fluconazole, miconazole, nystatin, and cycloheximide). Collectively these results demonstrate that disulfiram reverses Cdr1p-mediated drug resistance by interaction with both ATP and substrate-binding sites of the transporter and may be useful for antifungal therapy.
Results from prevention trials, including the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT), have fueled discussion about the cardiovascular (CV) risks associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We tested the hypotheses that (i) adverse CV events reported among ADAPT participants (aged 70 years and older) are associated with increased ratio of urine 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) (Tx-M) to 2'3-donor-6-keto-PGF1 (PGI-M) attributable to NSAID treatments; (ii) coincident use of aspirin (ASA) would attenuate NSAID-induced changes in Tx-M/PGI-M ratio; and (iii) use of NSAIDs and/or ASA would not alter urine or plasma concentrations of F(2)-isoprostanes (IsoPs), in vivo biomarkers of free radical damage. We quantified urine Tx-M and PGI-M, and urine and plasma F(2)-IsoPs from 315 ADAPT participants using stable isotope dilution assays with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and analyzed these data by randomized drug assignment and self-report compliance as well as ASA use. Adverse CV events were significantly associated with higher urine Tx-M/PGI-M ratio, which seemed to derive mainly from lowered PGI-M. Participants taking ASA alone had reduced urine Tx-M/PGI-M compared to no ASA or NSAID; however, participants taking NSAIDs plus ASA did not have reduced urine Tx-M/PGI-M ratio compared to NSAIDs alone. Neither NSAID nor ASA use altered plasma or urine F(2)-IsoPs. These data suggest a possible mechanism for the increased risk of CV events reported in ADAPT participants assigned to NSAIDs, and suggest that the changes in the Tx-M/PGI-M ratio was not substantively mitigated by coincident use of ASA in individuals 70 years or older.
N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) has been documented to be a pro-differentiative and anti-proliferative gene in cancer research. Our previous study found a significant NDRG2 up-regulation in reactive astrocytes of penumbra after transient focal cerebral ischemia, which was parallel to the enhancement of TUNEL-positive signals. However, it is still uncertain whether NDRG2 participates in cellular apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury in brain. In this study, we investigated the role of NDRG2 in cellular apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in IL-6-differentiated C6 glioma cells. The results showed that NDRG2 was up-regulated and translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after OGD exposure. NDRG2 over-expression exhibited an anti-proliferative effect and increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio after OGD exposure, while NDRG2 silencing promoted the cellular proliferation and attenuated the up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The pro-apoptotic effect of p53 was verified by the results in which p53 silencing greatly reduced the percentage of OGD-induced apoptotic cells. p53 silencing also reduced the OGD-induced NDRG2 up-regulation. However, over-expression of p53 did not further improve the NDRG2 up-regulation. In conclusion, NDRG2 is a p53-associated regulator of apoptosis in C6-originated astrocytes after OGD exposure. These findings bring insight to the roles of NDRG2 in ischemic-hypoxic injury and provide potential targets for future clinical therapies on stroke.
In vivo microdialysis was used to measure extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine in the diagonal band of Broca (DBB) during changes in blood pressure in conscious rats. Dialysate norepinephrine concentration was significantly increased during acute hypertension (280 +/- 40% of control), but was not changed by hypotensive hemorrhage. These results are consistent with the proposal that noradrenergic innervation of the DBB is selectively activated by increased blood pressure.
Seven patients who had been maintained on tricyclic antidepressants developed signs of hypomania or mania shortly (two-seven days) after drug withdrawal. Three patients responded promptly to treatment with neuroleptics. One patient receiving lithium and three others who received no further drug treatment experienced more gradual resolution of symptoms. Tricyclic withdrawal is accompanied by changes in the turnover rate of individual neurotransmitters as well as by shifts in the equilibrium between various transmitter systems. These events may be accompanied by alterations in mood. Although relapse to depression is more common, hypomania or mania may also occur.
Multiple bilateral microinjections of 1 g picrotoxin (blocker of GABAA-receptor chlorine channels) into the rostral neostriatum cause choreomyoclonic hyperkinesis of the paws, head, and body in rats. The most pronounced hyperkinesis was observed when the cannula was localized in the most anterior regions of the rostral neostriatum with irradiation of its action to the white matter (corpus callosum) and when the cannulas were located asymmetrically in the right and left striatum.
The effect of bisphenol A (BPA) on the reproductive system is highly debated but has been associated with meiotic abnormalities. However, evidence is lacking with regard to the mechanisms involved. In order to explore the underlying mechanisms of BPA-induced meiotic abnormalities in adult male rats, we exposed 9-week-old male Wistar rats to BPA by gavage at 0, 2, 20 or 200 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day for 60 consecutive days. 17β-Estradiol (E2) was administered at 10 μg/kg bw/day as the estrogenic positive control. Treatments with 200 μg/kg bw/day of BPA and E2 significantly decreased sperm counts and inhibited spermiation, characterized by an increase in stage VII and decrease in stage VIII in the seminiferous epithelium. This was concomitant with a disruption in the progression of meiosis I and the persistence of meiotic DNA strand breaks in pachytene spermatocytes,and the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and checkpoint kinase 2 signal pathway was also activated; Eventually, germ cell apoptosis was triggered as evaluated by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay and western blot for caspase 3. Using the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182780, we determined that ER signaling mediated BPA-induced meiotic disruption and reproductive impairment. Our results suggest that ER signaling-mediated meiotic disruption may be a major contributor to the molecular events leading to BPA-related male reproductive disorders. These rodent data support the growing association between BPA exposure and the rapid increase in the incidence of male reproductive disorders.
Epidemiological evidence suggests that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Certain NSAIDs can activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), which is a nuclear transcriptional regulator. Here we show that PPARgamma depletion potentiates beta-secretase [beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1)] mRNA levels by increasing BACE1 gene promoter activity. Conversely, overexpression of PPARgamma, as well as NSAIDs and PPARgamma activators, reduced BACE1 gene promoter activity. These results suggested that PPARgamma could be a repressor of BACE1. We then identified a PPARgamma responsive element (PPRE) in the BACE1 gene promoter. Mutagenesis of the PPRE abolished the binding of PPARgamma to the PPRE and increased BACE1 gene promoter activity. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines decreased PPARgamma gene transcription, and this effect was supressed by NSAIDs. We also demonstrate that in vivo treatment with PPARgamma agonists increased PPARgamma and reduced BACE1 mRNA and intracellular beta-amyloid levels. Interestingly, brain extracts from AD patients showed decreased PPARgamma expression and binding to PPRE in the BACE1 gene promoter. Our data strongly support a major role of PPARgamma in the modulation of amyloid-beta generation by inflammation and suggest that the protective mechanism of NSAIDs in AD involves activation of PPARgamma and decreased BACE1 gene transcription.
To study the anti-thrombosis effect of EEBL and its possible mechanism.
Using a thrombosis model induced by collagen-adrenaline in mice and an artery-vein bypass in rats. The effect of EEBL on erythrocyte membrane and thrombocyte membrane fluidity were measured by fluorescence polarization.
EEFL inhibited the thrombosis induced by collagen-adrenaline in mice and the thrombosis in artery-vein bypass in rats significantly. EEBL also enhanced in vitro erythrocyte membrane fluidity and thrombocyte membrane fluidity markedly.
The anti-thrombosis effect of EEBL may possibly be associated with the enhancement of fluidity of erythrocyte membrane and thrombocyte membrane. There exist anti-thrombosis chemical constituents in the body of beheaded leech.
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) complicating antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy is not well acknowledged in the neurologic literature. We report 4 patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy that occurred while they were receiving AEDs. All patients had shoulder and hand involvement, which in 2 was bilateral, and 1 had ipsilateral foot involvement. Two patients did not respond to a change in AEDs, but all improved with a course of prednisone. One patient with phenobarbital (PB)-associated RSDS relapsed on inadvertent rechallenge with secobarbital. A review of the literature showed that several other fibrosing disorders are associated with AED administration, including Dupuytren's contractures, frozen shoulder, plantar and hand nodules, and Peyronie's disease. RSD associated with AEDs is important to recognize because it may result in permanent disability if treatment is delayed.
Owing to marked fluctuations in plasma concentrations, circadian CNS toxicity (maximum in the early afternoon) occurred in a 69-year-old female patient being treated with an instant-release formulation of carbamazepine (CBZ). The neurologic syndrome was reversible after administration of the same daily dose as sustained-release formulation. This case illustrates the importance of correct timing of blood sampling to detect drug-induced toxicity and of use of sustained-release formulations in antiepileptic therapy with CBZ.
We report a case of ventriculostomy-related meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). The patient was successfully treated with administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin by both intravenous and intraventricular routes. A brief review of the literature is provided, which indicates that optimal management with quinupristin/dalfopristin should include daily intraventricular doses of at least 2 mg.
We observed transient parkinsonism in 2 young epileptic patients with valproate (VPA) therapy. Complete recovery from extrapyramidal disorder occurred spontaneously in a few weeks. The lack of apparent susceptibility related to age and to VPA dosage, the rapid recovery from the extrapyramidal reaction, and the prevalence of negative signs such as bradykinesia and bradyphrenia can be considered the main clinical findings of this disease process. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of this rare "toxic" reaction remain unknown, although a transient imbalance between functionally reciprocal subgroups of GABA pathways leading to remediable dopamine inhibition might be hypothesized.
Administration of potent vasodepressor agents such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, may precipitate myocardial ischemic events in patients with coronary artery disease, particularly if this treatment is preceded by a discontinuation of beta-blocking drugs such as propranolol. In one case studied, a patient experienced three episodes of angina pectoris under these conditions; in another, acute anterior myocardial infarction was suspect.
Nicotinic acid (niacin) is a well-established treatment for dyslipidaemia - an important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. However, niacin may also reduce blood pressure (BP), which is another important CVD risk factor. This review examines the limited publicly available data on niacin's BP effects. Acute administration of immediate-release niacin may lower BP because of niacin's acute vasodilatory effects. Although not always supported by clinical trial data, the package insert of a prescription, extended-release niacin describes niacin-induced acute hypotension. From a chronic standpoint, larger studies, such as the Coronary Drug Project, suggest that niacin may lower BP when administered over a longer period of time. Post hoc analyses of some of the more recent niacin clinical trials also support a more chronic, dose-dependent, BP-lowering effect of niacin. Because laropiprant [a prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) type 1 (DP1) receptor antagonist] does not attenuate niacin's BP-lowering effects, it is unlikely that any chronic lowering of BP by niacin is due to dilation of dermal vessels through activation of the DP1 receptor by PGD(2.) Further research is warranted to evaluate the extent and mechanisms of niacin's effects on BP.
To explore the efficacy of paraoxonase 1 (PON1) as a catalytic bioscavenger, we evaluated human recombinant PON1 (rePON1) expressed in Trichoplusia ni larvae against sarin and soman toxicity using microinstillation inhalation exposure in guinea pigs. Animals were pretreated intravenously with catalytically active rePON1, followed by exposure to 1.2 X LCt₅₀ sarin or soman. Administration of 5 units of rePON1 showed mild increase in the blood activity of the enzyme after 30 min, but protected the animals with a significant increase in survival rate along with minimal signs of nerve agent toxicity. Recombinant PON1 pretreated animals exposed to sarin or soman prevented the reduction of blood O₂ saturation and pulse rate observed after nerve agent exposure. In addition, rePON1 pretreated animals showed significantly higher blood PON1, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase activity after nerve agent exposure compared to the respective controls without treatments. AChE activity in different brain regions of rePON1 pretreated animals exposed to sarin or soman were also significantly higher than respective controls. The remaining activity of blood PON1, cholinesterases and brain AChE in PON1 pretreated animals after nerve agent exposure correlated with the survival rate. In summary, these data suggest that human rePON1 protects against sarin and soman exposure in guinea pigs.
Reversal of opioid-related respiratory depression is often accompanied by an "acute abstinence like syndrome" with hypertension, tachycardia, and pain. This overshoot was used to investigate the extent at which opioids of high potency but different structure are involved in naloxone-induced abstinence. In 10 awake and trained mongrel dogs two highly mu-selective compounds, alfentanil and fentanyl, were given in cumulative doses and at different occasions (30-60-120-240 micrograms/kg, and 6-12-24-48 micrograms/kg, respectively). Subsequently, a high dose of naloxone (100 micrograms/kg) was given at 5 min intervals while arterial blood gases, blood pressure, heart rate and the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) were measured continuously. Following a wash-out period, the 19-isoamyl derivative of etorphine (M-140; 10,000 times more potent than normorphine and a 4.5 fold potency of ethylketocyclazocine in a bioessay preparation) was also given in increasing doses (0.2-0.4-0.8-3.2 micrograms/kg). Again, naloxone was given (100 micrograms/kg) at 5 min interval, while cardiovascular parameters, blood gases and SEPs were measured continuously. All three opioids induced a dose-related respiratory depression with hypercarbia and hypoxia, a dose-related bradycardia, and a modest hypotension. This was accompanied by a dose-related depression of the amplitude of the SEP, reflecting the degree of blockade of nociceptive afferents. Naloxone was sufficient to reverse respiratory impairment after fentanyl, alfentanil and M-140. However, in contrast to fentanyl and alfentanil, there was no cardiovascular or evoked potential overshoot following naloxone reversal of M-140. After alfentanil naloxone increased blood pressure, heart rate and amplitude of the SEP by 7%, 41% and 38%, respectively. After fentanyl this increase in blood pressure, heart rate and amplitude of the SEP was 17%, 43% and 96%, respectively. The study indicates that the more potent the opiate mu ligands are the more is naloxone liable to induce a hyperexcitatory state of the cardiovascular system and an increase of nociceptive stimuli to pain modulating centres. After M-140 reversal of mu-related respiratory depression by naloxone was possible. However, no precipitation on an acute abstinence-like syndrome affecting antinociception or inducing cardiovascular overshoot was observed. This may stem from an intense binding and slow dissociation of the ligand from the receptor site or may be due to high binding affinity to both the mu and the kappa receptor site. Opioids which interact with various receptor sites may be of clinical interest for substitution therapy in opioid dependent addicts.
Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is evoked by diverse pathophysiological conditions and/or surgical procedures. Here, we evaluated the nephropreventive effect of sulfotransferase (SULT) inhibitors, quercetin, and resveratrol, which hamper hepatic indoxyl sulfate (IS) production. I/R of the kidney caused severe renal injury with marked accumulation of serum and renal IS and urinary excretion of kidney injury molecule-1. Oral administration of AST-120 resulted in a significant restoration of kidney injury, suggesting that uremic toxins, which can be suppressed or adsorbed by AST-120 in the intestine, contribute to the progression or development of I/R-induced AKI. Oral administration of resveratrol or quercetin, SULT inhibitors, suppressed IS accumulation, accompanied by significant amelioration of renal dysfunction. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the renal nuclear fractions was markedly elevated by renal I/R, but suppressed by treatment with SULT inhibitors. IS is primarily taken up by HK-2 cells derived from human proximal tubular cells via organic anion transporters, which then evokes activation of Nrf2, most likely due to intracellular oxidative stress. Renal basolateral organic anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3, which mediate renal tubular uptake of IS in basolateral membrane, were markedly downregulated by renal I/R, but restored by SULT inhibitors. Our results suggest that renal accumulation of IS in ischemic AKI induces oxidative stress and downregulation of organic anion transporters resulting in kidney damage, which could be restored to some extent by inhibiting hepatic SULT activity as a nephropreventive target.
Drug-eluting stents (DES) may be associated with an increased risk for stent thrombosis when compared with bare-metal stents. In endothelial cells, rapamycin induces tissue factor (TF) by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, the effect of mTOR inhibition on TF activity and thrombus formation in vivo has not yet been studied. Moreover, it is unclear whether second-generation DES substances everolimus and zotarolimus have an effect on endothelial TF expression.
In a mouse carotid artery photochemical injury model, rapamycin (182 +/- 27.5 microg/L) decreased time to thrombotic occlusion by 40%, increased TF activity, and abrogated p70S6K phosphorylation when compared with controls. In vitro, rapamycin, everolimus, and zotarolimus (each 10(-7) mol/l) enhanced TNF-alpha-induced TF expression by 2.2-, 1.7-, and 2.4-fold, respectively, which was paralleled by an increase in TF surface activity. Similar to rapamycin, everolimus and zotarolimus abrogated TNF-alpha-induced p70S6K phosphorylation under these conditions.
Rapamycin increases TF activity and promotes arterial thrombosis in vivo at concentrations relevant in patients undergoing DES implantation; this effect may increase the thrombogenicity of DES. Since everolimus and zotarolimus augment endothelial TF expression and activity in vitro in a similar manner as rapamycin, these findings may also be relevant for second generation DES.
Our in vitro experiments suggested that tetrahydroxystilbene glucoside (TSG) affords a significant neuroprotective effect against MPP⁺-induced damage and apoptosis in PC12 cells though activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. This study was aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of TSG in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropypridine (MPTP)-treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). We found that treatment of TSG protected dopaminergic neurons by preventing MPTP-induced decreases in substantia nigra tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells and striatal dopaminergic transporter (DAT) protein levels. Furthermore, it was also associated with increasing striatal Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, up-regulation of the Bcl-2/BAD ratio, and inhibition of the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These results showed that TSG promoted dopamine neuron survival in vivo, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may have mediated the protection of TSG against MPTP, suggesting that TSG treatment might represent a neuroprotective treatment for PD.
