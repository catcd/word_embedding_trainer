Altered DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that plays a key role in the carcinogenesis process, and the nongenotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogen phenobarbital (PB) alters the methylation status of DNA in mouse liver. The constitutive active/androstane nuclear receptor (CAR) mediates half of the PB-induced hepatic gene expression changes and it is essential for liver tumor promotion in PB-treated mice. Here, a technique involving methylation-sensitive restriction digestion, arbitrarily primed PCR, and capillary electrophoresis was utilized to detect PB-induced regions of altered DNA methylation (RAMs) in CAR wildtype (WT) mice that are sensitive to promotion by PB and resistant CAR knockout (KO) mice. The CAR WT mice developed preneoplastic lesions after 23 weeks of PB treatment (precancerous) and liver tumors after 32 weeks, while the CAR KO mice did not develop tumors (Y. Yamamoto, et al., 2004, Cancer Res. 64, 7197-7200). Our goal was to discern those RAMs which are playing important roles in tumor formation by comparing the RAMs that form in sensitive and resistant groups of mice. Using this novel approach, 42 unique RAMs were identified in the precancerous as compared to the CAR KO, 23-week PB-treated tissue. Of these 42 RAMs, 14 carried forward to the tumor tissue, and additionally, 104 total unique RAMs were observed in the tumor tissue. These results indicate that there are unique RAMs occurring in the sensitive CAR WT mice and that a portion of these are seen in both the precancerous and tumor tissue. We hypothesize that these unique RAMs may be facilitating the tumorigenesis process, and these data support the view that DNA methylation plays a causative role in PB-induced tumorigenesis.
Acute interstitial nephritis is a rare complication of treatment with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. A case is reported with severe, reversible, non-oliguric renal failure caused by biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis after therapy with mefenamic acid (Ponstan). Prednisone treatment resulted in normalization of renal function within 4 weeks.
The present report concerns the results at 1 year of a co-operative controlled clinical study carried out in Poland of the retreatment of patients with active, chronic, polyresistant far-advance pulmonary tuberculosis with an oral regimen of daily followed by intermittent ethambutol and rifampicin. A comparison was made of once- and twice-weekly supervised intermittent regimens of rifampicin 1200 mg plus ethambutol 50 mg/kg body weight under out-patient conditions after an initial inpatient phase of rifampicin 600 mg and ethambutol 25 mg/kg daily for 12 weeks. Patients were allocated at random to the regimens. Of 247 patients admitted to the study, 201 (81 per cent) completed 1 year's treatment as prescribed by the protocol, 46 (19 per cent) patients terminated their treatment prematurely before 1 year. After the daily phase of 12 weeks' treatment, 82 per cent were negative on smear and 85 per cent on culture; in the continuation intermittent phase, 98 per cent of patients in the once-weekly (E1R1) regimen were negative on culture at 28 weeks and 98 per cent in the twice-weekly (E2R2) regimen. The corresponding proportions at 52 weeks were 97 per cent and 97 per cent. At 12 months, 96 per cent of 101 ER/E1R1 and 96 per cent of 100 ER/E2R2 patients who completed 1 years' treatment were culture-negative.
Adverse reactions to practolol were studied in 198 prospectively monitored hospitalized medical patients. The mean age of the practolol recipients was 57 years; angina and cardiac arrhythmias were the most common indications for therapy. Adverse reactions were attributed to practolol in 20 patients (10%). Fifteen of these twenty reactions involved impairment of cardiac function (bradyarrhythmias, heart block, congestive heart failure, hypotension), and in three instances the reaction was considered life-threatening. Three additional patients had cutaneous reactions attributed to the drug. Adverse reactions to practolol were not dose-related, but toxicity appeared to be more frequent among patients concurrently receiving quinidine. The frequency of cardiovascular complications of propranolol in a similar series of patients was nearly identical. However, no skin reactions were attributed to propranolol. The findings suggest that practolol and propranolol produce unwanted cardiovascular effects with nearly equal frequency among hospitalized patients. Cutaneous reactions to practolol are evident even during short-term use.
The development of intestinal cancer involves complex genetic and epigenetic alterations in the intestinal mucosa. The principal signaling pathway responsible for the initiation of tumor formation, the APC-beta-catenin-TCF4 pathway, regulates both cell proliferation and colonic cell differentiation, but many other intrinsic and extrinsic signals also modulate these cell maturation pathways. The challenge is to understand how signaling and cell maturation are also modulated by nutritional agents. Through gene expression profiling, we have gained insight into the mechanisms by which short chain fatty acids regulate these pathways and the differences in response of gene programs, and of the specific regulation of the c-myc gene, to physiological regulators of intestinal cell maturation, such as butyrate, compared with pharmacological regulators such as the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug sulindac. Moreover, we used a combination of gene expression profiling of the response of cells in culture to sulindac and the response of the human mucosa in subjects treated with sulindac for 1 month, coupled with a mouse genetic model approach, to identify the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1) as an important suppressor of Apc-initiated intestinal tumor formation and a necessary component for tumor inhibition by sulindac. Finally, the mucous barrier, secreted by intestinal goblet cells, is the interface between the luminal contents and the intestinal mucosa. We generated a mouse genetic model with a targeted inactivation of the Muc2 gene that encodes the major intestinal mucin. These mice have no recognizable goblet cells due to the failure of cells to synthesize and store mucin. This leads to perturbations in intestinal crypt architecture, increased cellular proliferation and rates of cell migration, decreased apoptosis and development of adenomas and adenocarcinomas in the small and large intestine and the rectum.
Combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X (and proteins C, S, and Z) is usually an acquired clinical problem, often resulting from liver disease, malabsorption, or warfarin overdose. A rare inherited form of defective gamma-carboxylation resulting in early onset of bleeding was first described by McMillan and Roberts in 1966 and subsequently has been termed 'vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency' (VKCFD). Biochemical and molecular studies identify two variants of this autosomal recessive disorder: VKCFD1, which is associated with point mutations in the gamma-glutamylcarboxylase gene (GGCX), and VKCFD2, which results from point mutations in the vitamin K epoxide reductase gene (VKOR). Bleeding ranges in severity from mild to severe. Therapy includes high oral doses of vitamin K for prophylaxis, usually resulting in partial correction of factor deficiency, and episodic use of plasma infusions or prothrombin complex concentrate. Recent molecular studies have the potential to further our understanding of vitamin K metabolism, gamma-carboxylation, and the functional role this post-translational modification has for other proteins. The results may also provide potential targets for molecular therapeutics and pharmacogenetics.
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of acute fluoxetine treatment on pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in order to shape a model of seizures associated with treatment with antidepressants in rats. Moreover, the putative role of the hippocampal formation in this respect was investigated with the help of c-fos immuncytochemistry to mark local neuronal activity. It was found that fluoxetine (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the proconvulsive effect of pentylenetetrazol (50.0 mg/kg, i.p.), and simultaneously inhibited pentylenetetrazol-stimulated c-Fos expression in some areas of the hippocampus. Fluoxetine pretreatment did not alter pentylenetetrazol brain concentration indicating that this phenomenon was not related to the pharmacokinetic interaction. It is suggested that inhibition by fluoxetine of some neuronal populations contributing to the local feedback mechanism controlling excessive epileptiform discharges within the hippocampus might lead to an increase in epileptic activity. The reported in the present paper fluoxetine versus pentylenetetrazol interaction may, therefore, serve as a model of seizures associated with treatment with antidepressants.
The case of a 29 year old woman affected by fulminant hepatitis during the third trimester of pregnancy, after a 3 week administration of chlormezanone is reported. Following induced Caesarean delivery, the patient underwent an orthotopic liver transplantation. The mother and her baby were in good condition 26 months after liver transplantation. In this case, chlormezanone was probably responsible for the fulminant hepatitis.
Immunocompromised patients are at risk for invasive molds and resistant fungal infections for which amphotericin B may be the only feasible treatment. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) and renal tubular acidosis are known adverse effects of conventional amphotericin B; however, nephrogenic DI has been uncommonly associated with liposomal amphotericin B formulations. We describe an 18-year-old woman with aplastic anemia who developed invasive aspergillosis. She began treatment with high-dose (10 mg/kg/day) liposomal amphotericin B at home; however, her condition worsened, and she was hospitalized. Therapy with liposomal amphotericin B was continued until the patient began having symptoms consistent with nephrogenic DI. These symptoms resolved after discontinuation of liposomal amphotericin B; however, after rechallenge with lipid complex amphotericin B (5 mg/kg/day), the symptoms returned. The patient's nephrogenic DI was successfully treated with diuretics. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score indicated a probable relationship between liposomal amphotericin B and the development of nephrogenic DI. To our knowledge, this is the third report of nephrogenic DI induced by liposomal amphotericin B. This adverse effect is one of many severe adverse effects caused by all formulations of amphotericin B. A clear understanding of these adverse effects is vital for the clinician to successfully weigh the risks and benefits of antifungal therapy.
Vasospastic angina is rarely observed during cancer treatment. The present report describes two males with lung cancer, aged 73 and 61, who developed vasospastic angina during combination treatment of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation. As both patients have smoked and their ages are typical for patients with coronary artery disease, such events may be incidental. However, oncologists should be aware of the possible development of myocardial ischemia during or following administration of antineoplastic agents, especially in elderly patients with pre-existing coronary risk factors or a history of thoracic radiotherapy.
FK 506 is a potent immunosuppressive agent in clinical use in solid organ transplantation since 1989. Approximately 5% of patients receiving FK 506 develop major central nervous system toxicity but peripheral nervous system involvement is very uncommon, and there are only 4 reported cases of demyelinating polyneuropathy in patients who received a liver transplant. We report a case of demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with the use of FK 506 in a renal transplant recipient.
Diazepam, oxazepam, N-methyloxazepam, nitrazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam prevented seizures in mice produced by lidocaine, mepivacaine, and prilocaine, and in rats by lidocaine when administered IP five minutes before IP local anesthetic. ED50 values for antagonism of lidocaine tremors ranged from 0.7 to 5.2 mg/kg for N-methyloxazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam respectively in mice, and 0.08 to 0.54 mg/kg for N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam respectively, and for antagonism of prilocaine convulsions, 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg for N-methyloxazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam respectively. All compounds tested terminated ongoing lidocaine tremors when injected IV in mice with ED50 values ranging from 1.7 x 10(-3) to 3.0 x 10(-3) mg/kg for N-desmethyldiazepam and N-methyloxazepam respectively, N-methyloxazepam was significantly more potent after IP injection than nitrazepam, oxazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam against lidocaine in mice and more potent than N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam against mepivacaine; it was more potent than diazepam and oxazepam against lidocaine in rats. N-desmethyldiazepam was most potent against lidocaine in rats and lest potent in mice. There were no significant differences in ED50 values preventing prilocaine convulsions in mice or after IV injection to terminate ongoing lidocaine seizures. The presence of a methyl and hydroxyl group at position N-1 and C-3 respectively (N-methyloxazepam) was apparently responsible for the higher potency relative to some of the other compounds in preventing lidocaine and mepivacaine tremors in mice and lidocaine tremors in rats. It is concluded however that the magnitudes of differences in potencies of the compounds in antagonizing local anesthetic seizures in mice and rats were not so large as to prefer any single agent over diazepam.
Adverse reactions to the tricyclic antidepressant drugs imipramine and desipramine have been described and include eosinophilia, pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, and elevated total serum IgE levels. The immunologic mechanism accounting for these adverse reactions has not been elucidated. This article describes a patient manifesting bronchospasm, profound eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE levels after therapy with desipramine that resolved rapidly after withdrawal of the drug. Immunologic investigations failed to demonstrate specific IgE directed against a protein conjugate of desipramine but demonstrated the ability of desipramine to induce mast cell degranulation with direct intradermal skin challenges.
This study assessed the usefulness of the oral captopril test in the prediction of renal impairment among elderly patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Forty-seven patients aged > or = 65 years with CHF (EF < 40%) participated in a prospective nonrandomized series. Blood samples for plasma renin activity (PRA) were drawn before and 60 minutes after 50 mg of oral captopril. Twenty-four hours later, captopril was administered (up to 75 mg/day over a 4 day period), and renal laboratory and clinical assessment were performed at baseline and for a 9 day period. In 7 of 47 patients (14.9%), deterioration of renal function was observed. During the captopril test, the PRA increased significantly after 1 hour in almost all patients and the mean blood pressure decreased from 99.2 +/- 14.6 mmHg to 92.2 +/- 13.7 mmHg (p < 0.001). All patients whose baseline PRA level was < 1.9 ng/ml/hr and whose stimulated PRA was < 3.2 ng/ml/hr maintained a stable renal function throughout the study period. Significant statistical correlation (p < 0.05) was found between the initial PRA, the changes in PRA or mean blood pressure during the captopril test, and the change in plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance in the entire group, and was even more evident in a subgroup of patients with an ejection fraction > or = 30%. All these correlations were not statistically significant in the patients with an ejection fraction < 30%. It is thus concluded that measurement of pretreatment PRA levels might be a useful laboratory tool for predicting the renal safety of captopril use in patients with CHF whose EF > or = 30%.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may accelerate the cognitive and motor dysfunction found in normal aging, but few studies have examined these outcomes and PCB exposure among older adults.
We evaluated neuropsychological status and low-level PCB exposure among older adults living along contaminated portions of the upper Hudson River in New York.
A total of 253 persons between 55 and 74 years of age were recruited and interviewed, and provided blood samples for congener-specific PCB analysis. Participants also underwent a neuropsychological battery consisting of 34 tests capable of detecting subtle deficits in cognition, motor function, affective state, and olfactory function.
After adjustment for potential confounders, the results indicated that an increase in serum total PCB concentration from 250 to 500 ppb (lipid basis) was associated with a 6.2% decrease in verbal learning, as measured by California Verbal Learning Test trial 1 score (p = 0.035), and with a 19.2% increase in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (p = 0.007).
The results suggest that exposure to PCBs may be associated with some measures of memory and learning and depression among adults 55-74 years of age whose current body burdens are similar to those of the general population. Although the results are useful in delineating the neuropsychological effects of low-level exposure to PCBs, further studies of whether older men and women are a sensitive subpopulation are needed.
In the hospital for pulmonary tuberculosis in children, a group of 975 children treated with streptomycin sulphate was audiologically examined and in 36% of children ototoxic lesions were defined. From these, in 24% the damage affected only the vestibular labyrinth, in 8% both the vestibular labyrinth and the organ of Corti and in 4% the organ of Corti alone.
A patient is reported who developed fatal liver failure on ketoconazole treatment for Cushing's syndrome. It is recommended that metyrapone be used when hypercortisolism has to be controlled as a temporary measure in childhood and adolescence.
Corticosteroid insensitivity is a major barrier of treatment for some chronic inflammatory diseases, such as severe asthma, but the molecular mechanism of the insensitivity has not been fully elucidated. The object of this study is to investigate the role of protein phosphate 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase, on corticosteroid sensitivity in severe asthma.
Corticosteroid sensitivity was determined by the dexamethasone ability to inhibit TNFα-induced IL-8 or LPS-induced TNFα production. PP2A expression, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear translocation defined as the nuclear/cytoplasmic GR ratio and phosphorylation of GR-Ser²²⁶, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and PP2A were analysed by Western-blotting. Phosphatase activity was measured by fluorescence-based assay. Okadaic acid (OA), a PP2A inhibitor, reduced corticosteroid sensitivity with reduced GR nuclear translocation and increased GR phosphorylation in U937 monocytic cells. PP2A knockdown by RNA interference showed similar effects. IL-2/IL-4 treatment to U937 reduced corticosteroid sensitivity, and PP2A expression/activity. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from severe asthma, the PP2A expression and activity were significantly reduced with concomitant enhancement of PP2A(C)-Tyr³⁰⁷ phosphorylation compared with those in healthy volunteers. As the results, GR-Ser²²⁶ and JNK1 phosphorylation were increased. The expression and activity of PP2A were negatively correlated with phosphorylation levels of GR-Ser²²⁶. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay in U937 cells revealed that PP2A associated with GR and JNK1 and IL-2/IL-4 exposure caused dissociation of each molecule. Lastly, PP2A overexpression increased corticosteroid sensitivity in U937 cells.
PP2A regulates GR nuclear translocation and corticosteroid sensitivity possibly by dephosphorylation of GR-Ser²²⁶ via dephosphorylation of upstream JNK1. This novel mechanism will provide new insight for the development of new therapy for severe asthma.
Naphthalene is a nasal carcinogen, inducing respiratory adenomas in male and olfactory neuroblastomas in female rats, respectively. The reasons for the site and sex-specific tumorigenic response are unknown. Naphthalene is bioactivated to electrophilic metabolites; cytotoxicity followed by regenerative cell proliferation is likely involved in the tumorigenic response. To examine sex differences in the acute nasal response to naphthalene, male and female F344 rats were nose-only exposed to 0, 1, 3, 10, or 30 ppm naphthalene vapor for 4 or 6 h. Following exposure, respiratory/transitional mucosa (RTM) and olfactory mucosa (OM) were isolated and analyzed for markers of oxidant/electrophilic stress and/or toxicity, including reduced/oxidized glutathione levels (GSH/GSSG), mRNA levels of electrophile-responsive genes, and epithelial cytoxicity (as measured by membrane permeability to ethidium homodimer-1). Naphthalene caused significant depletion of GSH in RTM and OM with no increase in GSSG. Cytotoxicity was apparent at concentrations of 15 and 30 ppm. No consistent sex differences were observed in these responses. Sex differences were observed in the induction of antielectrophilic genes in OM: glutamyl cysteine ligase (catalytic subunit) (Gclc), NADPH quinone oxidase 1 (Nqo1), and heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) were all induced to a greater extent in the male OM compared with the female. No consistent sex differences were observed in the RTM. Although the mechanism of the sex difference in the RTM adenoma response remains enigmatic, sex differences in the induction of antioxidant/electrophile-responsive genes may contribute to the heightened sensitivity of the female OM to the carcinogenic effects of naphthalene.
Proliferation and differentiation of cells in female reproductive organs, the oviduct, uterus and vagina, are regulated by endogenous estrogen. In utero exposure to a synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), induces vaginal clear-cell adenocarcinoma in humans. In mice, perinatal exposure to DES results in abnormalities such as polyovular follicles, uterine circular muscle disorganization and persistent vaginal epithelial cell proliferation. We reported the persistent gene expression change such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) related genes, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and its downstream signaling in the mouse vagina exposed neonatally to DES. In this study, we found persistent up-regulation of Wnt4 and persistent down-regulation of Wnt11 in the vagina of mice exposed neonatally to DES and estrogen receptor α specific ligand. Also Wnt4 expression in vagina is correlated to the stratification of epithelial cells with the superficial keratinization of vagina, but not epithelial cell stratification only.
The cysteine conjugates of the nephrotoxins hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD), tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and hexafluoropropene (HFP), together with those of trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, have been chemically synthesized and a relationship determined between their structures and their nephrotoxicity and mutagenicity in vitro. All of the conjugates had a marked effect on the uptake of both the organic anion p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and the cation tetraethylammonium bromide (TEA) into rat kidney slices, suggesting activation of the conjugates in the slices to a toxic species which interferes with ion transport. This observation is consistent with the known nephrotoxicity of HCBD, TFE and HFP in vivo. Each of the conjugates was found to be metabolised by rat kidney slices and by semi-purified rat kidney beta-lyase to pyruvate, ammonia and an unidentified reactive metabolite. When semi-purified beta-lyase was used stoichiometric amounts of pyruvate and ammonia were produced. Although all of the conjugates were activated by beta-lyase and had a similar effect on ion transport their mutagenicity differed markedly. The conjugates of HCBD, trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene were mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay when activated by rat kidney S9. Metabolic cofactors were not required suggesting that activation was due to the enzyme beta-lyase. In the same assay the conjugates of TFE and HFP were not mutagenic either in the presence or absence of rat kidney S9 and cofactors. With a limited number of cysteine conjugates a clear distinction has been identified between the conjugates of chloroalkenes which were were similarly nephrotoxic but were not mutagenic. The mutagenicity of the cysteine conjugate of HCBD is consistent with the known renal carcinogenicity of this chemical.
The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) has a central role in sodium transport across membranes. It is expressed on the apical cell surface of renal tubular epithelia and also on other aldosterone-responsive epithelial cells. In the kidney, ENaC contributes to the regulation of blood pressure via changes in sodium balance and blood volume. Rare monogenetic disorders associated with hypertension have been described, such as Liddle syndrome, which gives rise to increased sodium reabsorption in the kidney via increased ENaC activity. There are many other variants in the genes encoding ENaC subunits, some of which occur with sufficient frequency as to be termed polymorphic variants. The Thr594Met polymorphism of the ENaC beta-subunit gene SCNN1B occurs exclusively in Black individuals, with a frequency of 6-8% in those with hypertension. It increases cAMP mediated ENaC sodium current in affected B lymphocytes, and has been associated with hypertension in a Black South London population. There is preliminary evidence that amiloride is effective as monotherapy in hypertensive individuals with the Thr594Met polymorphism and in patients with resistant hypertension, who have evidence of increased amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity. If these preliminary studies are corroborated in larger studies, then amiloride may provide an important new strategy for blood pressure control in selected individuals.
We critically evaluated the etiologic role of inorganic arsenic in human prostate cancer.
We assessed data from relevant epidemiologic studies concerning environmental inorganic arsenic exposure. Whole animal studies were evaluated as were in vitro model systems of inorganic arsenic carcinogenesis in the prostate.
Multiple studies in humans reveal an association between environmental inorganic arsenic exposure and prostate cancer mortality or incidence. Many of these human studies provide clear evidence of a dose-response relationship. Relevant whole animal models showing a relationship between inorganic arsenic and prostate cancer are not available. However, cellular model systems indicate arsenic can induce malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial cells in vitro. Arsenic also appears to impact prostate cancer cell progression by precipitating events leading to androgen independence in vitro.
Available evidence in human populations and human cells in vitro indicates that the prostate is a target for inorganic arsenic carcinogenesis. A role for this common environmental contaminant in human prostate cancer initiation and/or progression would be very important.
Thirty-six adults with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in second or greater chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis underwent marrow or blood stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling using high-dose thiotepa, busulfan and cyclophosphamide (TBC) as the preparative regimen. All evaluable patients engrafted and had complete donor chimerism. One patient failed to clear meningeal leukemia, and one patient had one of 30 metaphases positive for the Philadelphia chromosome at 2 months post transplant. The remainder of the patients studied had eradication of CML documented by cytogenetics and/or Southern blot for BCR gene rearrangement, and 13 of 15 patients studied became negative for the BCR gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction. Three-year relapse rate is 42% (95% CI, 19-64%). The relapse rate was significantly lower for patients transplanted without blast crisis (9% vs 100%, P < 0.001). Eight (22%, 95% CI, 10-39%) patients had severe or fatal veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Elevated liver enzymes within 1 month prior to transplantation and transplantation using marrow were significantly associated with the occurrence of VOD. Three-year survival is 28% (95% CI, 13-43%). Survival was significantly higher for patients transplanted without blast crisis (45% vs 0%, P = 0.01). TBC is an effective preparative regimen for CML in accelerated phase but not refractory blast crisis, and it should be used with caution in patients with prior hepatopathy who have an increased risk of severe VOD.
The authors performed 72-hour polysomnography, including a levodopa-placebo-controlled choice reaction time test with continuous monitoring of cardiovascular variables in two patients with Parkinson's disease complaining of excessive daytime sleepiness on levodopa monotherapy. The subacute levodopa challenge was accompanied by physiologic sleep episodes, worsened reaction times, and a reduction in mean blood pressure and heart rate over baseline values, linked temporally to the sleep episodes.
The authors herein present two children with mild absence epilepsy, having intermittent absences, who developed absence status evolving into atonic generalized seizures and drop attacks along with progressive disorientation induced by relatively small doses of valproic acid. Consciousness and awareness were intact before the introduction of valproic acid. Both children, after the first dose of valproic acid, developed prolonged and recurrent clusters of absences, which became prolonged, with drop attacks occurring in one patient associated with progressive disorientation. The electroencephalogram concurrently demonstrated prolonged spike-wave discharges, along with disturbance of background activity. Discontinuation of valproic acid resulted in immediate cessation of the prolonged and repetitive clusters of absence episodes and disappearance of drop attacks, along with sensorium clearing. In conclusion, although uncommon, a possible induction of absence status and even atonic seizures by valproic acid should be taken into account and properly managed by abrupt discontinuation of the drug.
Pisa syndrome is a rare type of truncal dystonia. Its development is associated commonly with neuroleptic treatment, but there are rare idiopathic cases or those related to neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, an association between cholinesterase inhibitors and Pisa syndrome has been described. The authors report two patients, one with Alzheimer's disease treated with risperidone and another with Parkinson's disease who presented this kind of dystonia after donepezil initiation. In the first patient the condition resolved after discontinuation of risperidone, and in the second one the condition resolved when donepezil was withdrawn. In patients with pharmacologic or degenerative dopaminergic neurotransmission disorders, cholinergic excess may induce this peculiar type of dystonia.
