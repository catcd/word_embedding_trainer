Mercury is a global pollutant considered to be a persistent bioaccumulative and toxic chemical. Humans may be exposed to organic forms of mercury by either inhalation, oral, or dermal routes. Methylmercury is more toxic to living organisms than the inorganic forms. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the altered functions of alveolar macrophage including nitric oxide production after methylmercury exposure. Treatment of 7 muM methylmercury for 24 h inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase production of alveolar macrophages. The addition of H-89 (PKA inhibitor) significantly decreased the methylmercury inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-mediated nitric oxide production. We found the cell had a calcium-dependent adenylate cyclase, and MeHg could inhibit the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK). Because methylmercury could increase the intracellular calcium ion concentration, it might activate the adenylate cyclase by increasing [Ca(2+)](i). Though the interaction of methylmercury with the immune system has been studied by several investigators, the actual mechanisms underlying these interactions are still poorly understood. We discovered that methylmercury could activate protein kinase A, which in turn would inhibit the activation of Raf-1-ERK and so inhibit the release of nitric oxide.
We investigated the effects of isoflurane on the rabbit cardiovascular system at several end-tidal concentrations. Furthermore, because isoflurane has been reported to produce tachycardia while reducing sympathetic nervous activity and baroreflex function, we evaluated whether the chronotropic effects of isoflurane could be due to a vagal withdrawal. ECG, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were obtained in rabbits the conscious, unsedated state and during isoflurane anesthesia by telemetric device. Measurements of pH, oxygen, carbon dioxide, plasma catecholamines, baroreflex sensitivity, and spectral analysis of HR variability were made in nonanesthetized and anesthetized animals. Isoflurane caused an increase in HR at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and MAP at 1 and 1.5 MAC. Biochemical analysis showed that isoflurane-mediated cardiovascular effects were not accompanied by any significant changes in plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) levels. Neither were any significant differences in plasma catecholamine levels noted between anesthetized and awake animals. The analysis of spectral components of HR variability and baroreflex function indicated that isoflurane induced a marked reduction in the low- and high-frequency spectral power of HR variability and in baroreflex sensitivity. Tachycardia under isoflurane was suppressed dose dependently by the administration of clonidine or atenolol and was not influenced by bilateral vagotomy. Collectively, our results indicate that cardiovascular effects induced by isoflurane in smaller animals such as rabbits are similar to those observed in humans and other animal species. We showed that isoflurane-induced tachycardia is mainly the result of vagal withdrawal rather than a baroreflex response, even though a marginal role of baroreflex in heart response to higher concentrations of isoflurane cannot be excluded.
Estrogens stimulate proliferation and enhance survival of the prolactin (PRL)-producing lactotroph of the anterior pituitary gland and induce development of PRL-producing pituitary tumors in certain inbred rat strains but not others. The goal of this study was to elucidate the genetic bases of estrogen-induced pituitary tumorigenesis in reciprocal intercrosses between the genetically related ACI and Copenhagen (COP) rat strains. Following 12 weeks of treatment with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES), pituitary mass, an accurate surrogate marker of absolute lactotroph number, was increased 10.6-fold in ACI rats and 4.5-fold in COP rats. Composite interval mapping analyses of the phenotypically defined F(2) progeny from the reciprocal crosses identified six quantitative trait loci (QTL) that determine the pituitary growth response to DES. These loci reside on chromosome 6 [Estrogen-induced pituitary tumor (Ept)1], chromosome 3 (Ept2 and Ept6), chromosome 10 (Ept9), and chromosome 1 (Ept10 and Ept13). Together, these six Ept loci and one additional suggestive locus on chromosome 4 account for an estimated 40% of the phenotypic variance exhibited by the combined F(2) population, while 34% of the phenotypic variance was estimated to result from environmental factors. These data indicate that DES-induced pituitary mass behaves as a quantitative trait and provide information that will facilitate identification of genes that determine the tumorigenic response of the pituitary gland to estrogens.
Two hundred and twenty-eight deaths due to the use of contrast media are reported, including 15 from intravenous cholangiography, 69 from angiography, 140 from urography and four other. The causes are analyzed and the various explanations for reactions to contrast media are considered. Data concerning the high incidence of cardiac death, the large number of deaths due to pulmonary edema, and the known transgression of the blood-brain barrier by contrast media are used to construct a theory that bases all reactions on the effect of contrast media on the central nervous system.
Ritodrine is the only medicament approved by FDA in the USA as well as in our country for prevention of the threatening preterm labor. Its adverse effects upon the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, including pulmonary oedema and myocardial ischemia, occur more frequently during the intravenous therapy than during the oral maintenance therapy. The aim of this report was to present a patient with cardiovascular adverse effects of ritodrine, who had her pregnancy terminated by an urgent cesarean section under general anesthesia. In the course of operation, the patient had two cardiac arrest (total of 70 min). Resuscitation was performed by direct and indirect heart massage. The patient's condition was stabilized during the next six hours. The patient was transferred to the coronary unit, where the treatment was continued for 30-days period, after which the patient was released home as completely recovered.
The effects of various combinations of epinephrine-halothane and epinephrine-enflurane were tested on beating myocardial muscle cells cultured from 2- to 3-day-old rats. A series of culture plates containing myocytes were exposed to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2% halothane. At each halothane concentration, 9 ng of epinephrine was added, and the rate of contraction and rhythm of myocytes were observed. With increasing halothane concentrations, a significant and progressive increase in the percentage of plates demonstrating arrhythmia was observed. In a separate series of experiments, doses of epinephrine were added following exposure to 1.5% halothane. As the dose of epinephrine was increased progressively more plates displayed arrhythmia. In addition, culture plates were exposed to enflurane (3 and 6%), and epinephrine was added to each plate. No arrhythmia was observed in any of the 3% enflurane exposed plates. However at 6%, 100% of the plates displayed arrhythmia. In another series of experiments the efficaciousness of quinidine, procaine amide, lidocaine, propranolol, and verapamil in converting cell culture arrhythmia to normal rhythm following epinephrine and halothane was tested. Quinidine converted 96% of all arrhythmic plates to normal rhythm, procaine amide 80%, lidocaine 50%, and propranolol 10%. Verapamil failed to convert any arrhythmic plates to normal rhythm. It was concluded from this study that halothane directly "sensitizes" heart cells in tissue culture, and that the "sensitization" process is a linear, dose-dependent phenomenon.
The combination of angina pectoris, angiographically normal epicardial coronary arteries, and a positive exercise test is referred to as syndrome X. Previous studies have demonstrated an impaired coronary flow reserve and a peripheral vascular dysfunction, suggesting that vascular abnormalities in syndrome X may not be confined to the heart. The aim of this study was to investigate whether any vascular disorder of syndrome X is due to intrinsic structural or functional disturbances in resistance arteries. We compared 16 patients with syndrome X (56.6+/-1.2 years, 3 men) with 15 matched control subjects. Myocardial blood flow was measured with 13N-ammonia positron emission tomography. Forearm blood flow was measured in the brachial artery with high-resolution ultrasound. Gluteal subcutaneous resistance arteries were dissected and mounted on a myograph for measurement of active tension development, lumen diameter, and media thickness. Baseline myocardial blood flow was similar in patients and controls, but dipyridamole-induced hyperemia was decreased in patients (1.67+/-0.13 vs 2.31+/-0.12 ml/ min/g, p <0.01). Patients and controls had similar baseline forearm blood flow, but hyperemic flow after transient occlusion of the brachial artery was impaired in patients (198+/-20 vs 273+/-32 ml/min, p <0.05). Isolated resistance arteries showed no differences in constriction to noradrenaline, or relaxation to acetylcholine, dipyridamole, or nitroglycerin. Furthermore, the ratio between media thickness and lumen diameter were similar in syndrome X patients and controls. Our data show that when compared with a well-matched control group, syndrome X patients have a decreased coronary and peripheral vasodilator capacity. However, this is not reflected by functional abnormalities or structural changes as evaluated in subcutaneous resistance arteries. We conclude that syndrome X is not a generalized intrinsic abnormality of the resistance circulation.
Five haloalkanes--CBrCl3, CCl4, CHCl3, and 1,1,1-and 1,1,2-trichloroethane (TCE)--were ranked for their relative hepatotoxicity in an in vitro system of isolated hepatocyte suspensions and in vivo by po administration of the test chemical to fasted rats of the same strain and sex as used for the hepatocytes. Cytotoxic parameters used for ranking in the in vitro system were GOT and LDH release, and the results were expressed in terms of EC50 values (the dissolved haloalkane concentration required to release 50% of the cell content of each enzyme after 2 hr of exposure) for rank determination. Cytotoxic parameters measured in vivo were SGOT and SGPT, and the ranking was based on ED50 values (the haloalkane dose that produced an above normal serum transaminase level in 50% of the test animals). With these parameters, the potency rankings in each system were the same except that of 1,1,1-TCE, which was more cytotoxic in the in vitro system than would have been expected from the animal experiments. Purification of the 1,1,1-TCE to remove stabilizers, use of phenobarbital-induced hepatocytes or hepatocytes from starved rats, and administration of the haloalkanes ip instead of po failed to improve the correlation. The discrepancy could be resolved, however, by factoring air: medium partition coefficient data into the EC50 values to take into account differences in the volatility and aqueous and lipid solubility of the chemicals, and hence their retention in vivo. These observations encourage the belief that isolated hepatocyte systems have value for ranking structurally related chemicals as to their cytotoxic potential, even though their mechanisms of action may differ.
In Sweden, from 1985 through 1995, 40 fetuses at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) to prevent virilization of affected females. We report long-term effects on neuropsychological functions and scholastic performance of this controversial treatment.
Prenatally treated children, 7 to 17 yr old, were assessed with standardized neuropsychological tests (A Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment and Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children) and child-completed questionnaires measuring self-perceived scholastic competence (Self-Perception Profile for Children). A parent-completed questionnaire (Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 School Scale) was used to evaluate whether the treatment had any impact on the children's school performance. In addition, a child-completed questionnaire measuring social anxiety (The Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised) was completed by the prenatally treated children aged 8 to 17 yr (n = 21) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 26).
Of 40 DEX-treated children, 26 (median age, 11 yr) participated in the study. Thirty-five sex- and age-matched healthy children were controls. There were no between-group differences concerning psychometric intelligence, measures of cerebral lateralization, memory encoding, and long-term memory. Short-term treated, CAH-unaffected children performed poorer than the control group on a test assessing verbal working memory (P = 0.003), and they rated lower on a questionnaire assessing self-perception of scholastic competence (P = 0.003). This group also showed increased self-rated social anxiety assessed by The Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised (P = 0.026). Prenatally treated, CAH-affected children performed poorer than controls on tests measuring verbal processing speed, although this difference disappeared when controlling for the child's full-scale IQ.
This study indicates that prenatal DEX treatment is associated with previously not described long-term effects on verbal working memory and on certain aspects of self-perception that could be related to poorer verbal working memory. These findings may thus question future DEX treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Therefore, we encourage additional retrospective studies of larger cohorts to either confirm or challenge the present findings.
To report a case in which bipolar depression was resistant to usual therapies, requiring dosages of bupropion >450 mg/d and to review the literature on mania associated with bupropion and propose a potential theory of a dose-related threshold associated with bupropion and mania.
A 44-year-old white man with a 25-year history of bipolar affective disorder presented with depression resistant to usual therapies. Bupropion therapy was initiated and the dosage was titrated to 600 mg/d. After exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose (450 mg/d), he experienced a manic episode attributed to high-dose bupropion.
Due to increased risk of seizures, current prescribing guidelines state that the total daily dose of bupropion is not to exceed 450 mg/d. Since bupropion is the agent least likely to cause a manic switch in bipolar disorder, this agent seemed a logical choice to treat the patient's depression. Due to a lack of response, the bupropion dosage was titrated to a maximum of 600 mg/d. Since the patient did not switch into mania until the dosage exceeded 450 mg/d, we speculate that this adverse reaction is a dose-related phenomenon. Scientific literature supports this theory.
A switch into mania is a potential risk associated with antidepressant drug use in bipolar affective disorder. Bupropion is believed to be associated with a decreased risk compared with other antidepressant therapies. However, our case report as well as others support the theory that this decreased risk may be due to dosages not exceeding the recommended daily dose (450 mg/d). Doses of bupropion >450 mg/d should be used with caution in depressed patients with bipolar affective disorder.
In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the role of oxidative stress on the hepatic damage caused by methotrexate (MTX) and the possible protective effects of beta-carotene against this damage. The rats were divided into four groups as control, MTX (20 mg/kg ip), beta-carotene (10 mg/kg/day ip) + MTX, and beta-carotene. Histopathologic alterations were evaluated for defining the liver damage. The tissue, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GP-x) contents and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotranferase (ALT) activities were also examined. Histopathologic damage for each group score findings have been determined as control: 0.66 +/- 0.33; MTX: 7.0 +/- 0.68; beta-carotene + MTX: 3.3 +/- 0.42; and beta-carotene: 0.5 +/- 0.3. In the MTX-treated group, MDA, AST, and ALT values were increased, while SOD and GP-x values were decreased compared with the control group. In the beta-carotene + MTX-treated group, AST and ALT values significantly decreased, while all other parameters were similar to the control group. This study shows that beta-carotene has a protective effect on MTX-induced oxidative hepatic damage. Consequently, it seems that an antioxidant agents like beta-carotene may be useful in decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy.
This was a study of the microscopic, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and enzyme cytochemical features of giant eosinophilic granules encountered in pancreatic acinar cells of alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Seven male F344 rats with diabetes induced by a single i.v. dose of alloxan were sacrificed after twenty-five weeks of treatment. Histologically, the pancreatic acini were diffusely atrophied, and the islets showed marked atrophy or had disappeared, and giant eosinophilic granules and small vacuoles were observed in almost all acinar cells. The eosinophilic granules showed negative reactions for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and acid phosphatase, as well as fat stains such as Nile blue, Oil red O, and Sudan III. Ultrastructurally, the giant eosinophilic granules were huge structures surrounded by a double membrane containing many irregular cristae. A large amount of small lipid droplets was also apparent in the basal area of the acinar cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of prohibitin, a kind of protein located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, was partially positive in the marginal area of some giant eosinophilic granules, but negative for the central area. The enzyme activity for succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), one of the mitochondrial enzymes, showed a localizing pattern similar to that of prohibitin. These findings confirmed that the giant eosinophilic granules in the exocrine pancreas of alloxan-induced diabetic rats were giant mitochondria.
Lithium (Li)-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) has been attributed to the increased production of renal prostaglandin (PG)E(2). Previously we reported that extracellular nucleotides (ATP/UTP), acting through P(2y2) receptor in rat medullary collecting duct (mCD), produce and release PGE(2). Hence we hypothesized that increased production of PGE(2) in Li-induced NDI may be mediated by enhanced purinergic signaling in the mCD. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either control or Li-added diet for 14 or 21 days. Li feeding resulted in marked polyuria and polydipsia associated with a decrease in aquaporin (AQP)2 protein abundance in inner medulla ( approximately 20% of controls) and a twofold increase in urinary PGE(2). When acutely challenged ex vivo with adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPgammaS), UTP, or ADP, mCD of Li-fed rats showed significantly higher increases (50-130% over control diet-fed rats) in PGE(2) production, indicating that more than one subtype of P(2y) receptor is involved. This was associated with a 3.4-fold increase in P(2y4), but not P(2y2), receptor mRNA expression in the inner medulla of Li-fed rats compared with control diet-fed rats. Confocal laser immunofluorescence microscopy revealed predominant localization of both P(2y2) and P(2y4) receptors in the mCD of control or Li diet-fed rats. Together, these data indicate that in Li-induced NDI 1) purinergic signaling in the mCD is sensitized with increased production of PGE(2) and 2) P(2y2) and/or P(2y4) receptors may be involved in the enhanced purinergic signaling. Our study also reveals the potential beneficial effects of P(2y) receptor antagonists in the treatment and/or prevention of Li-induced NDI.
Interaction of more than two chemicals from foods is a very important factor for carcinogenic risk assessment and management. 2-Amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), one of the most abundant carcinogenic heterocyclic amines in cooked foods, is speculated to be a human liver carcinogen. MeIQx is metabolically activated by CYP1A2 and then N-acetyltransferase (NAT), findings that suggest that its carcinogenic potential might be enhanced by simultaneous exposure to chemical(s) inducing CYP1A2. Therefore, we here investigated the effects of alpha- and beta-naphthoflavone as CYP1A2 inducers on MeIQx-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis in a medium-term rat liver bioassay. Unexpectedly, no modifying influence of naphthoflavones on MeIQx-induced hepatocarcinogenesis was demonstrated with reference to glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci in the liver, although up-regulation of CYP1A2 was detected on Western blot analysis. Activity of NAT was not affected. In MeIQx-treated rats, CYP1A expression was mainly detected in zone 3 of the liver where GST-P positive foci were preferentially located, while naphthoflavones alone or combinations of naphthoflavones and MeIQx induced CYP1A expression in zone 1. This difference in intralobular distribution of CYP1A might be related to the fact that MeIQx hepatocarcinogenesis was not modified by the two CYP1A inducers.
In a clinical investigation on the treatment of Parkinson's syndrome it is shown that a combination of L-dopa with decarboxylase inhibitor (L-carbidopa) shows advantages compared to treatment with L-dopa alone. To achieve the same therapeutic effect a quarter of the dose is sufficient; the good tolerance, even in relation to the digestive and cardiovascular apparatus, permits the use of relatively larger daily doses. The favorable action appears more quickly. The effect of the treatment can be potentiated by pyridoxine. The only disadvantage is the fairly frequent occurrence of hyperkinesia, especially of oral automatism. But treatment does not need to be broken off because of this.
The antileishmanial efficacy of the reference drug N-methylglucamine antimoniate (Glucantime) was evaluated in groups of rhesus monkeys with acute and chronic Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis cutaneous infection. The therapeutic responses in experimental animals to either a low dose (5 mg/kg body wt/day for 28 days) or a routine dose (20 mg/kg/day for 28 days) of pentavalent antimony were similar to those reported in the human disease. Primates were cured of their lesions after treatment, but with cryptic parasitism and/or relapse. The rhesus model of L. (V.) braziliensis cutaneous leishmaniasis therefore provides an additional resource for preclinical trials with newer drugs.
To study the effects of nicotine on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in vivo and in vitro, (Balb/c x C57Bl/6) F1 mice were given water containing 100 microg/mL nicotine for six months. Cultured fetal RPE cells were treated with nicotine or lipopolysaccharide for seventy-two hours. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase protein (MMP)2, MMP9, and VEGF was measured using Western blot. Expression of IL6 and IL8 was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Electron microscopy was performed to observe the effects of nicotine on morphological changes of mice retina or cultured RPE cells, and filamentous actin in RPE cells was stained with phalloidin. Electron microscopy revealed that nicotine-treated mice showed thinner outer nuclear layers, fewer pigment granules in RPE cells, and a damaged photoreceptor-RPE interface when compared with age-control mice. When added to cultured RPE cells, nicotine induced accumulation of osmiophilic lamellated intracellular inclusions in cytoplasm, mitochondrion hypertrophy and vacuolar degeneration, and redistribution of actin in cells without affecting cell proliferation. Expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in nicotine-treated RPE cells was decreased. Nicotine-induced changes in RPE morphology and function provide insight into pathogenesis of smoking-related retinal diseases.
Prazosin was used as additional therapy in seven patients with severe chronic congestive cardiac failure. The effect on renal function in this situation was measured. Renal function improved in four of the seven patients, and this improvement was associated with improvement in their clinical condition; in two other patients, modest improvement in renal function was not associated with symptomatic relief which may have been the result of a gain in weight.
This study was aimed to evaluate the preventive role of (-)epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) on lysosomal enzymes in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarcted rats. Male albino Wistar rats were pretreated with EGCG (30 mg/kg) daily for a period of 21 days. After the treatment period, ISO (100 mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected to rats at intervals of 24h for 2 days. The activities of lysosomal enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-galactosidase, cathepsin-B and cathepsin-D) were increased significantly (P<0.05) in serum and the heart of ISO-induced rats. ISO-induction also resulted in decreased stability of membranes, which was reflected by decreased activities of beta-glucuronidase and cathepsin-D in mitochondrial, nuclear, lysosomal and microsomal fractions. Pretreatment with EGCG daily for a period of 21 days to ISO-induced rats prevented the changes in the activities of these enzymes. Oral treatment with EGCG (30 mg/kg) to normal control rats did not show any significant effect in all the biochemical parameters studied. Thus, the results of our study shows that EGCG protects the lysosomal membrane against ISO-induced cardiac damage. The observed effects might be due to the free radical scavenging and membrane stabilizing properties of EGCG.
Several properties of pancreatic beta-cells in type 2 diabetes (T2D) were studied by using islets isolated from T2D subjects. Moreover, because metformin has protective effects on nondiabetic beta-cells exposed to high glucose or free fatty acid levels, we investigated its direct action on T2D islet cells. Diabetic islets were characterized by reduced insulin content, decreased amount of mature insulin granules, impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion, reduced insulin mRNA expression, and increased apoptosis with enhanced caspase-3 and -8 activity. These alterations were associated with increased oxidative stress, as shown by higher nitrotyrosine concentrations, increased expression of protein kinase C-beta2 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced-oxidase, and changes in mRNA expression of manganese- superoxide dismutase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Twenty-four-hour incubation of T2D islets with metformin was associated with increased insulin content, increased number and density of mature insulin granules, improved glucose-induced insulin release, and increased insulin mRNA expression. Moreover, apoptosis was reduced, with concomitant decrease of caspase-3 and -8 activity. These changes were accompanied by reduction or normalization of several markers of oxidative stress. Thus, T2D islets have several functional and survival defects, which can be ameliorated by metformin; the beneficial effects of the drug are mediated, at least in part, by a reduction of oxidative stress.
Exposure to moderately selective p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors in the Beagle dog results in an acute toxicity consisting of mild clinical signs (decreased activity, diarrhea, and fever), lymphoid necrosis and depletion in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen, and linear colonic and cecal mucosal hemorrhages. Lymphocyte apoptosis and necrosis in the GALT is the earliest and most prominent histopathologic change observed, followed temporally by neutrophilic infiltration and acute inflammation of the lymph nodes and spleen and multifocal mucosal epithelial necrosis and linear hemorrhages in the colon and cecum. These effects are not observed in the mouse, rat, or cynomolgus monkey. To further characterize the acute toxicity in the dog, a series of in vivo, in vitro, and immunohistochemical studies were conducted to determine the relationship between the lymphoid and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and p38 MAPK inhibition. Results of these studies demonstrate a direct correlation between p38alpha MAPK inhibition and the acute lymphoid and gastrointestinal toxicity in the dog. Similar effects were observed following exposure to inhibitors of MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), further implicating the role of p38alpha MAPK signaling pathway inhibition in these effects. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that p38alpha MAPK inhibition results in acute lymphoid and GI toxicity in the dog and is unique among the species evaluated in these studies.
The purpose of this investigation was to compare the convulsant activity of two quinolones differing, respectively, by the presence (pefloxacin) or absence (norfloxacin) of a methyl group on the piperazine moiety at the position 7 of their parent nuclei and consequently by their lipophilicity. An in vivo model was used, which can distinguish between ease in reaching pharmacological receptors at the central nervous system level, and ability to interact with these receptors. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 230g-300g) received an i.v. infusion of pefloxacin or norfloxacin at one of four different rates: 480, 960, 1440 and 1920 micromol/hr, until the onset of maximal seizures. This occurred after an average of 12.7 to 69.4 min. We found enough evidence to suggest that in these conditions the contribution of pefloxacin metabolites, including norfloxacin, to its convulsant activity was negligible. Doses of pefloxacin and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma (total and unbound) at the pharmacodynamic endpoint were all independent of infusion rate, whereas only cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of norfloxacin were independent of infusion rate. The overall cerebrospinal fluid concentration of norfloxacin (47.3 +/- 9.9 micromol/liter) was about 8-fold lower than that of pefloxacin (380 +/- 27 micromol/liter), indicating that on average the "intrinsic convulsant activity" of norfloxacin is 8-fold greater than that of pefloxacin. However, total doses of pefloxacin and norfloxacin at the onset of maximal seizures were in the same order of magnitude (1500-2000 micromol/kg), suggesting that the higher ability of the more lipophilic pefloxacin to reach central nervous system compensates for its lower intrinsic convulsant activity.
