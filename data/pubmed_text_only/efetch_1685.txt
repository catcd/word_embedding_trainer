Aluminum phosphide (AlP), a poison extensively used as a grain fumigant and rodenticide, can cause an increase or decrease in blood glucose levels Both hypo- and hyper-glycemic effects of AlP can be attributed to the wide variety of changes in magnesium, calcium, phosphate, citrate and cortisol levels. These biochemical changes can act as active stimulatory or inhibitory modulators to enzymes and hormones that catalyze and regulate glucose metabolism. According to the type of biochemical changes, AlP can cause either elevation, decrease or no change in blood glucose levels. A case of AlP-caused death is reported.
The induction of P450 cytochromes Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 in the liver of male mice differing in sensitivity to the carcinogenic effect of o-aminoazotoluene (OAT) has been studied. The level of Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 mRNA was assayed by quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In both OAT-treated strains, the level of Cyp1a1 mRNA increased more than 1000-fold, while the amount of Cyp1a2 mRNA increased only two- or threefold. Interstrain differences in the Cyp1a mRNA level were revealed. The level of Cyp1a1 mRNA in liver of OAT-induced A/Sn mice was three times higher than in CC57BR mice. The amount of Cyp1a2 mRNA in control and OAT-treated mice was 7 and 13 times higher, respectively, than in CC57BR mice. The enzyme activities of cytochromes P450 1a were assayed. An increase in Cyp1a1 mRNA level in OAT-treated mice correlated with an enhancement of the benzo[a]pyrene hydrolase and 7-ethoxyresofurin o-deethylase activities; the correlation between the level of Cyp1a2 mRNA and 7-ethoxyresofurin o-demethylase activity was much less pronounced. Interstrain variation in Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 activities was also shown at the enzyme activity level. We suppose that quantitative differences in the Cyp1a2 mRNA level play a key role in OAT-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
In the present study, we examine whether human pancreatic carcinoma cells express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and the effect of PPARgamma activation by its selective ligand on cellular growth in pancreatic cancer cells. Immunohistochemical study of resected human pancreata using a polyclonal PPARgamma antibody revealed that PPARgamma protein expression in the nuclei of carcinoma cells was observed in 9 of 10 pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In contrast, normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells in the samples expressed no PPARgamma. Reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot analysis demonstrated that all four tested human pancreatic cancer cell lines, PK-1, PK-8, PK-9, and MIA Paca-2, expressed PPARgamma mRNA. Luciferase assay in PK-1 cells showed that troglitazone, a selective ligand for PPARgamma, transactivated the transcription of a peroxisome proliferator response element-driven promoter in a dose-dependent fashion. Troglitazone inhibited the growth of all four pancreatic carcinoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that troglitazone induced G1 arrest in PK-1 cells. To examine the role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in the G1 arrest by troglitazone, we determined p27KiP1, p21CiP1/Waf1, or p18Ink4c protein expression by Western blot analysis in troglitazone-treated PK-1 cells. Troglitazone increased p27Kip1 but not p21Cip1/Waf1 or p18Inkc protein levels in time- and dose-dependent manners. To clarify the functional importance of p27Kip1 in the cell growth inhibition by troglitazone. All these results suggest that PPARgamma could be considered as a possible target molecule for treatment in human pancreatic carcinomas.
Tincture of Crataegus (TCR), an alcoholic extract of the berries of hawthorn (Crataegus oxycantha), is used in herbal and homeopathic medicine. The present study was done to investigate the protective effect of TCR on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats. Pretreatment of TCR, at a dose of 0.5 mL/100 g bodyweight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in isoproterenol-induced rats (85 mg kg(-1) s. c. for 2 days at an interval of 24 h). TCR prevented the isoproterenol-induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of ADP-stimulated oxygen uptake and respiratory coupling ratio. TCR protected against pathological changes induced by isoproterenol in rat heart. The results show that pretreatment with TCR may be useful in preventing the damage induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.
To investigate the regulatory effects of mifepristone and progesterone on the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by endometrial and endometriosis cells in vitro.
Primary cultures of eutopic and ectopic endometrial cells from 9 cases of endometriosis were exposed to mifepristone (10(-6) mol/L, 10(-4) mol/L) and progesterone (1 x 10(-7) mol/L, 1 x 10(-5) mol/L) respectively. IL-6 secretion was analyzed in the culture medium by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELSA).
Mifepristone inhibited the IL-6 secretion of ectopic endometrial cells, with the concentrations of IL-6 was (1 914.33 +/- 799.28) microg/L in the 1 x 10(-6) mol/L group (P < 0.01) and (990.25 +/- 58.40) microg/L in the 10(-4) mol/L group (P < 0.01). Progesterone also inhibited IL-6 secretion of ectopic endometrial cells, with (2 575.89 +/- 119.75) microg/L in the 1 x 10(-7) mol/L group (P < 0.05) and (1 736.25 +/- 750.89) microg/L in the 10(-5) mol/L group (P < 0.01). Mifepristone restrained the secretion of IL-6 by eutopic endometrial cells, with (346.96 < or = 24.32) microg/L in the 1 x 10(-6) mol/L group (P < 0.01) and (270.22 +/- 36.15) microg/L in the 1 x 10(-4) mol/L group (P < 0.01). All the effects of down regulation were more obvious when the concentrations of mifepristone and progesterone increased (P < 0.05 - 0.01) . Secretion of IL-6 by eutopic endometrial cells did not change significantly when incubated with progesterone (P > 0.05).
The inhibitory effects on the secretion of IL-6 by ectopic and (or) eutopic endometrium may provide one of the cellular therapeutic mechanisms of mifepristone and progesterone on endometriosis.
Young male Sprague-Dawley rats in 3 groups were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.10 wt. % each of thalidomide and its imide-analog of much higher teratogenicity, EM 12. Following an induction period of 17 days on the diets, all animals were injected subcutaneously with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine at 20 mg/kg for a total of 20 weekly doses and killed on week 18 after the 20th injection. The total number of colon adenocarcinomas and their occurrence in the proximal and distal portions for the thalidomide-treated rats were similar to those of the respective controls. However, the EM 12-fed group elicited statistically significant increases both in the total and ascending colon-based adenocarcinomas as compared with the control findings, in keeping with its greater teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. The numbers of small intestinal adenocarcinomas were equally higher in the imide-fed groups in contrast to the control frequency.
To report the occurrence of a potential tacrolimus elevation in a renal transplant recipient after adding metronidazole to the medication regimen.
A 24-year-old white man status post living-related renal transplant who had been stabilized on tacrolimus 4 mg twice daily (trough concentrations 7-10 ng/mL) for 2 months and prednisone 20 mg daily presented to the clinic with severe diarrhea. Stool cultures were positive for Clostridium difficile, and therapy with metronidazole 500 mg 4 times daily was initiated. Between days 4 and 14 of metronidazole therapy, the patient's tacrolimus trough concentration and serum creatinine level increased to maximum levels of 26.3 ng/mL and 3.3 mg/dL (baseline 1.6-1.8 mg/dL), respectively. Tacrolimus was withheld for one dose and then decreased to 1 mg twice daily. Two days after metronidazole discontinuation, tacrolimus trough concentrations dropped to 9.4 ng/mL and serum creatinine to 2.3 mg/dL, warranting a tacrolimus dose increase to 3 mg daily.
As of April 15, 2005, one other case has been reported documenting an elevation in tacrolimus concentrations with the addition of metronidazole. The possible mechanism may be related to metronidazole's weak inhibition of CYP3A4 and, possibly, P-glycoprotein. According to the Naranjo probability scale, metronidazole was the probable cause of this adverse reaction.
Coadministration of tacrolimus with metronidazole may result in elevated tacrolimus concentrations, possibly leading to tacrolimus toxicity. Practitioners should be aware of this potential interaction and closely monitor tacrolimus concentrations and renal function.
Continuous application of transdermal nitroglycerin appears to result in tolerance to the antianginal effect. In a double-blind study the effects of continuous (24 h/day) and intermittent (16 h/day) application of transdermal nitroglycerin in a dosage of 10 mg/day were compared with the effects of placebo in 12 patients with chronic stable angina receiving treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking or calcium channel blocking agents. Exercise performance was assessed 2 to 4 hours after initial application and after 1 week of each treatment given in random order with a 3 day interval between treatments. Exercise time to onset of angina, total exercise duration and time to 1 mm ST segment depression were all significantly increased after initial application during the continuous and intermittent treatment periods. These increases were maintained after 1 week of intermittent but not continuous treatment. Thus the benefit of initial application of transdermal nitroglycerin is maintained with intermittent treatment and a daily nitrate-free interval, whereas tolerance to antianginal effect occurs with continuous treatment.
The introduction of polyethylene glycol as a solvent for etomidate appears to markedly reduce the incidence of pain on injection while maintaining the previously demonstrated advantageous features of cardiovascular stability and rapid recovery.
Smokeless tobacco use is a major public health hazard whose incidence is increasing, particularly among male adolescents. Little research has been done on cessation programs designed to assist smokeless tobacco users in ending their habit. There have been no studies on the use of nicotine polacrilex chewing gum as an adjunct to cessation.
Fourteen of 88 male smokeless tobacco users in a professional baseball organization enrolled in a cessation program and were followed for up to 12 months. The program consisted of two support group sessions at the spring training camp followed by adjunctive use of nicotine polacrilex chewing gum during the baseball season as monitored by the athletic trainers.
At 2 to 4 months, only 3 of 14 participants were completely abstinent from smokeless tobacco. Follow-up data at 6 to 12 months revealed that only one participant was abstinent. The 14 ballplayers experienced various side effects of nicotine chewing gum: bad taste (6), nausea (4), headache (4), jaw discomfort (3), and dizziness (1). Despite these side effects, 11 of the 14 participants replied that they would recommend the gum to others trying to quit. Most participants (10) felt that quitting the smokeless tobacco habit was "very difficult."
We conclude that nicotine chewing gum as an adjunct to smokeless tobacco cessation had limited effectiveness. Further study on smokeless tobacco cessation methods is needed.
To report a case of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) necessitating the placement of a permanent cardiac pacemaker in a patient on tacrolimus after a cadaveric orthotopic liver transplantation.
A 46-year-old African American male, who had been receiving tacrolimus 4 mg/day orally for the preceding 6 months, developed a Miller Fisher variant of GBS (severe ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, areflexia). He developed symptomatic sinus pauses requiring a cardiac pacemaker. He improved substantially after cessation of tacrolimus and initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. The patient was not rechallenged with tacrolimus due to the clinical/ethical gravity of this probable adverse effect.
Although different types of neuropathies have been reported with the use of tacrolimus, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a Miller Fisher variant of GBS severe enough to cause dysautonomia requiring a cardiac pacemaker associated with the use of this drug. Causality assessment using the Naranjo probability scale revealed the adverse drug event was probable.
Tacrolimus was probably associated with a Miller Fisher variant of GBS necessitating the placement of a permanent cardiac pacemaker in this patient. MFS needs to be considered a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of tacrolimus therapy.
Several large clinical trials have demonstrated that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors decreased the incidence of stroke independently of their cholesterol-lowering effect. We have investigated the effect of post-stroke treatment with atorvastatin on neurological deficits and mortality in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP). The vehicle-treated group showed significantly aggravated neurological deficits compared with those observed on the first day of stroke. In contrast, the post-stroke oral administration of atorvastatin at 3 or 30 mg kg(-1)/day significantly ameliorated these neurological deficits. Atorvastatin improved the survival rate in a dose-dependent manner, with this effect being significant at 30 mg kg(-1)/day. Atorvastatin did not affect blood pressure, heart rate or total cholesterol in SHR-SP at either dose. In contrast, it significantly increased plasma nitric oxide (NO) levels at both doses. These results indicated that post-stroke administration of atorvastatin ameliorated neurological deficits and prolonged survival, which might have resulted from increased plasma NO, apart from its effect on cholesterol level and blood pressure in SHR-SP. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the protective effects of post-stroke administration of atorvastatin against stroke in SHR-SP.
Certain unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), cleaved from lipoproteins, are known to activate the serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) alpha- and beta-isoforms. To investigate the role of UFAs in apoptosis of endothelial cells, we cocultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with THP-1 monocytes. Phorbol-12-myristic-13-acetate (PMA)-treated THP-1 monocytes differentiated into macrophages and synthesized lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the major enzyme for hydrolysis of triglycerides. We demonstrated that LPL from THP-1 macrophages released UFAs from VLDL, which were capable of inducing apoptosis in HUVECs. Physiological concentrations of VLDL did not cause apoptosis in HUVECs, whereas the combination of VLDL with LPL-rich cell medium of THP-1 macrophages did. THP-1 macrophages and HUVECs in cocultivation did not interfere with each other. However, addition of VLDL to this coculture caused apoptosis in HUVECs. Furthermore, inhibition of LPL by adding orlistat to the culture medium and down-regulation of LPL by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the extent of apoptosis of HUVECs. In conclusion, our results show that the amounts of UFAs liberated from lipoproteins are high enough to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells. This underlines the proatherogenic role of UFAs in hyperlipoproteinemias.
Primary macroglobulinemia with acute renal failure developed in a 46-year-old man after administration of contrast medium (containing diatrizoate sodium and meglumine [Urografin]) for intravenous pyelography. On admission, the monoclonal protein peak could not be detected in serum by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, but the serial electrophoresis revealed a gradual increase in monoclonal protein peak, which later became two peaks. The serum of the patient contained the monoclonal small-molecule IgM kappa-chain protein with 13 to 14 Svedberg units in sedimentation constants, which is antigenetically the same as native IgM heavy chain. Although acute renal failure is extremely rare in primary macroglobulinemia, the small-molecule IgM seems to be one factor that induces acute renal failure.
Understanding how specific genetic variants modify drug action pathways may provide informative blueprints for individualized chemotherapy.
We applied a pathway-based approach to examine the impact of a comprehensive panel of genetic polymorphisms on clinical outcomes in 210 esophageal cancer patients.
In the Cox proportional hazards model, MTHFR Glu429Ala variant genotypes were associated with significantly improved survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89) in patients treated with fluorouracil (FU). The 3-year survival rates for patients with the variant genotypes and the wild genotypes were 65.26% and 46.43%, respectively. Joint analysis of five polymorphisms in three FU pathway genes showed a significant trend for reduced recurrence risk and longer recurrence-free survival as the number of adverse alleles decreased (P = .004). For patients receiving platinum drugs, the MDR1 C3435T variant allele was associated with significantly reduced recurrence risk (HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.64) and improved survival (HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.85). In nucleotide excision repair genes, there was a significant trend for a decreasing risk of death with a decreasing number of high-risk alleles (P for trend = .0008). In base excision repair genes, the variant alleles of XRCC1 Arg399Gln were significantly associated with the absence of pathologic complete response (odds ratio = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.14 to 6.12) and poor survival (HR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.00 to 3.72).
Several biologically plausible associations between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms and clinical outcomes were found. Our data also strongly suggest that combined pathway-based analysis may provide valuable prognostic markers of clinical outcomes.
A significant increase in tumor regression was induced in N-nitroso-N-methylurea-induced mammary tumors in rats treated with the combination of melatonin and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA). Treatment groups included: control (ethanolic saline), 9cRA (30 mg/kg chow/day), melatonin 500 microg/day, melatonin 1000 microg/day, melatonin 500 microg/day+9cRA and melatonin 1000 microg/day+9cRA. Rats treated with the lower dose of melatonin 500 microg+9cRA show the greatest degree of tumor regression (78%), with 54% undergoing complete regression and a significant increase in apoptotic cells observed by TUNEL Assay. Furthermore, tumor multiplicity and burden were significantly decreased by the combination of melatonin and 9cRA.
Anthracycline cardiotoxicity is cumulative and can cause congestive heart failure. The cardiotoxicity caused by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is acute and is usually observed during the first cycle of chemotherapy. We present the case of a female patient operated on for colorectal cancer and receiving her first postoperative chemotherapy cycle. Three hours after the initiation of continuous 5-FU infusion she developed signs of acute heart failure (AHF) and pulmonary edema. The patient did not have any previous history of heart disease. Symptoms resolved 24 hours from the onset of the episode after the initiation of the relevant emergency therapy. One of the most common symptoms related to 5-FU cardiotoxicity is chest pain. In case of such a toxicity treatment should be switched to another antineoplastic agent.
Whether succinylcholine causes an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with brain lesions is uncertain and, if increased ICP does occur, its pathophysiology remains unknown. The authors investigated both the effect of succinylcholine on ICP and its modification with prior neuromuscular blockade by measuring ICP (subarachnoid bolt) in 13 consecutive patients with brain tumors who received succinylcholine both before and after complete neuromuscular blockade with vecuronium. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental, 6 mg X kg-1 iv, and nitrous oxide, 70% in oxygen, while ventilation was controlled (PaCO2 = 37.2 mmHg +/- 1.7 SE). Succinylcholine, 1 mg X kg-1 iv, was administered and ICP, heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP) were recorded until normal twitch tension was restored. Complete neuromuscular blockade was then established with vecuronium, 0.14 mg X kg-1 iv; 3 min later, succinylcholine, 1 mg X kg-1 iv, was repeated. The resulting changes in ICP, HR, and BP were recorded for 3 min. Following the first dose of succinylcholine, mean ICP increased from 15.2 mmHg +/- 1.3 SE to 20.1 mmHg +/- 2.0 SE (P less than 0.05), with five of the patients sustaining increases in ICP of 9 mmHg or greater. In contrast, when succinylcholine was given after vecuronium-induced paralysis, no patient developed an increase in ICP greater than 3 mmHg (P less than 0.05 compared with the incidence of ICP greater than or equal to 9 mmHg observed after the first dose of succinylcholine). A second group of six patients received two doses of succinylcholine according to the same protocol but without an intervening dose of vecuronium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To investigate the expression of the key marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) IRE1 mRNA and neuronal apoptosis in the rat hippocampus after status convulsivus (SC), and the intervention effects of edaravone, a novel free radical scavenger.
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged 19-21 days were randomly assigned to three groups: normal control, SC and edaravone-treated SC. SC was induced in the later two groups. The two groups were subdivided into 5 groups sacrificed at 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs after SC induction. IRE1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus was detected by RT-PCR. Neuronal apoptosis was observed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The ultramicrostructural changes of neuron were observed by electron microscopy.
IRE1 mRNA expression was obviously up-regulated 4 and 12 hrs after SC compared with the normal control group (P<0.01). IRE1 mRNA expression in the edaravone-treated SC group was notably higher than the untreated SC group 4, 12 and 24 hrs after SC and the normal control group (P<0.01). TUNEL positive cells in the hippocampus in the untreated SC group were significantly more than those in the normal control group (P<0.01). The number of TUNEL positive cells increased with the prolonged convulsion time. TUNEL positive cells in the edaravone-treated SC group were significantly reduced compared with those in the untreated SC group 12, 24, 48 and 72 hrs after SC (P<0.05 or P<0.01), but remained higher than the normal control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The peri-nucleus cell organ injuries were observed 4 hrs after SC and karyopycnosis and cytoplasm condensation were observed 12 hrs after SC in the SC and the edaravone-treated SC groups. The edaravone-treated SC group demonstrated less severe apoptosis than the untreated SC group.
Edaravone may have neuroprotections against SC by an up-regulation of IRE1 expression. It might serve as an effective agent for reducing ERS in vivo.
Pesticides are associated with excess risk of multiple myeloma, albeit inconclusively. We included 678 men (30-94 years) from a well-characterized prospective cohort of restricted-use pesticide applicators to assess the risk of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Serum samples from all subjects were analyzed by electrophoresis performed on agarose gel; samples with a discrete or localized band were subjected to immunofixation. Age-adjusted prevalence estimates of MGUS were compared with MGUS prevalence in 9469 men from Minnesota. Associations between pesticide exposures and MGUS prevalence were assessed by logistic regression models adjusted for age and education level. Among study participants older than 50 years (n = 555), 38 were found to have MGUS, yielding a prevalence of 6.8% (95% CI, 5.0%-9.3%). Compared with men from Minnesota, the age-adjusted prevalence of MGUS was 1.9-fold (95% CI, 1.3- to 2.7-fold) higher among male pesticide applicators. Among applicators, a 5.6-fold (95% CI, 1.9- to 16.6-fold), 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.5- to 10.0-fold), and 2.4-fold (95% CI, 1.1- to 5.3-fold) increased risk of MGUS prevalence was observed among users of the chlorinated insecticide dieldrin, the fumigant mixture carbon-tetrachloride/carbon disulfide, and the fungicide chlorothalonil, respectively. In summary, the prevalence of MGUS among pesticide applicators was twice that in a population-based sample of men from Minnesota, adding support to the hypothesis that specific pesticides are causatively linked to myelomagenesis.
Leg paralysis and wallerian degeneration of sciatic nerve fibres have been produced in rats by intraneural injection of 0.5, 1 or 5 microgram of vincristine (VCR) or formyl leurosine (FLR) dissolved in 5 microliter of saline. Nerve lesions were dose-related, and were similar for equal concentrations of the two drugs. Six patients received one to three 5-day courses of FLR. The total dose of FLR administered ranged from 15 to 131 mg (mean 83 mg). Clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy were absent in four patients, and limited to orthostatic hypotension in one case and transient depression of reflexes in another. Motor conduction velocities measured in four peripheral nerves, and muscle evoked potentials remained unchanged throughout the treatment in all patients.
Isotretinoin is a very effective drug for the treatment of severe recalcitrant acne. However, it's use is associated with many side effects, sometimes is associated with the emergence of psychiatric symptoms. During of a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of isotretinoin in acne, six male patients, refer difficulties in maintaining adequate penile erection in association with clinical symptoms of depression. To our knowledge this is the first time that this side effect is reported, so the results suggest that further studies of it's use in similar patients are warranted.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are synthetic derivatives of the native decapeptide produced by the hypothalamus. These agents cause a reversible suppression of the synthesis and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary gland. With GnRH agonist therapy, there is a resulting loss of endogenous ovarian gonadotropin stimulation and a severe hypo-estrogen state consistent with castrate levels of estrogen. Recently, GnRH agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin have been noted to be effective in treating mild to severe endometriosis. Side effects of these agents are consistent with the physiological effects of ovarian suppression, such as vasomotor instability, vaginal dryness, and headaches. However, despite some reports of emotional lability as an adverse effect of GnRH agonists, it appears that the occasional, rather severe psychiatric consequences of these agents are underappreciated. In this article, we present the case reports of 4 women of reproductive age with no prior psychiatric history who were treated with a GnRH agonist for endometriosis. These women developed symptoms consistent with various psychiatric disorders, including panic disorder and major depression with and without psychotic features. Three of these patients were given sertraline while on GnRH agonist therapy, which improved their mood and anxiety symptoms. Women undergoing GnRH agonist therapy may provide a model with which to investigate mood disorders during the perimenopausal stage of life.
We investigated whether the pressor effects of systemically administered angiotensin II (AII) influence ACTH secretion. Adrenalectomized barbiturate-anesthetized mongrel dogs with constant low resting cortisol concentrations due to slow constant cortisol infusion received either bolus injections (2.5 micrograms kg-1) or 15-min i.v. infusions of a low dose (12.5 ng kg-1min-1) of AII during which blood samples were taken for ACTH and cortisol determinations. In sequential continuous experiments in each dog, blood pressure was allowed to increase in response to AII administration or was controlled by means of concurrent i.v. injections or infusions of the hypotensive drug papaverine, or by blood withdrawal from the vena cava. When the arterial pressure rise induced by AII was substantially attenuated or prevented by papaverine administration or blood withdrawal, mean ACTH secretion rates increased 400-800% and mean ACTH concentrations increased by 280-500%. On the other hand, AII administration alone caused large increases in mean arterial blood pressure but did not increase ACTH secretion significantly above control levels. These data suggest that when endogenous AII levels are elevated without a concurrent increase in blood pressure, as occurs during hypovolemia or sodium depletion, AII may have a significant influence on ACTH secretion.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and lithium are highly effective treatments for mood disorders. Both treatments, however, are associated with cognitive side effects which reduce patient compliance and treatment satisfaction. Both therapies also have a significant effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT) activity. Preliminary results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive thyroid hormone (T3) and ECT showed better memory function in patients receiving T3 compared with placebo. This neuroprotective effect of T3 has been confirmed using electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in rats, and shown to be independent of the number of electrical stimulations. Results of studies in patients with bipolar disorder taking lithium have demonstrated that cognitive deficits are significantly related to diminished thyroid status, but not lithium levels. Preliminary evidence also shows that adjunctive thyroid hormone improves cognitive functioning in patients taking lithium. These findings, if replicated and confirmed, indicate a potential role for adjunctive thyroid hormone in reducing the cognitive side effects of these important psychiatric treatments. This, in turn, may lead to improved treatment compliance, diminished overall morbidity, and reduced healthcare utilization.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic endocrine disruptor widely used in the production of plastics. Increasing evidence indicates that in utero BPA exposure affects sexual differentiation and behavior; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. We hypothesized that BPA may disrupt epigenetic programming of gene expression in the brain. Here, we provide evidence that maternal exposure during pregnancy to environmentally relevant doses of BPA (2, 20, and 200 µg/kg/d) in mice induces sex-specific, dose-dependent (linear and curvilinear), and brain region-specific changes in expression of genes encoding estrogen receptors (ERs; ERα and ERβ) and estrogen-related receptor-γ in juvenile offspring. Concomitantly, BPA altered mRNA levels of epigenetic regulators DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3A in the juvenile cortex and hypothalamus, paralleling changes in estrogen-related receptors. Importantly, changes in ERα and DNMT expression in the cortex (males) and hypothalamus (females) were associated with DNA methylation changes in the ERα gene. BPA exposure induced persistent, largely sex-specific effects on social and anxiety-like behavior, leading to disruption of sexually dimorphic behaviors. Although postnatal maternal care was altered in mothers treated with BPA during pregnancy, the effects of in utero BPA were not found to be mediated by maternal care. However, our data suggest that increased maternal care may partially attenuate the effects of in utero BPA on DNA methylation. Overall, we demonstrate that low-dose prenatal BPA exposure induces lasting epigenetic disruption in the brain that possibly underlie enduring effects of BPA on brain function and behavior, especially regarding sexually dimorphic phenotypes.
