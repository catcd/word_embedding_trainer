A 52-year-old man developed minimal change nephrotic syndrome which responded only partially to prednisolone. The addition of cyclophosphamide resulted in a complete remission. During a second episode of nephrotic syndrome prednisolone and cyclophosphamide only gave a partial remission. During a third episode, 42 months after the initial presentation, Hodgkin's disease clinical stage IA was diagnosed. Mantle field radiation therapy was given after which proteinuria gradually decreased to zero in the course of 17 months. The patient has remained free of disease until now (15 months).
Neonates affected by hyperprostaglandin E(2) syndrome (HPS) present with severe polyuria. Both urinary losses as well as prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors may precipitate acute renal failure (ARF).
Our goal was to maintain euvolaemia by replacement of urinary losses.
Our patient was born prematurely with a family history typical of HPS. Urinary salt and water losses and PGE(2) excretion were determined in 2- to 4-h intervals. Salt and water were replaced accordingly.
Within the first 48 h, urinary losses and PGE(2) increased continuously to 50 ml/kg/h and 374 ng/h/1.73 m(2), respectively. Following exposure to 0.05-0.5 mg/kg/d indomethacin, urinary output decreased steadily to 10-15/ml/kg/h.
In euvolaemic preterm neonates with HPS and the need for excessive replacement of salt and water, inhibition of renal PGE(2) excretion with indomethacin effectively reduces polyuria and natriuresis without acutely compromising renal function.
To examine the relation of doxapram to a developmental score achieved by a structured telephone interview in a group of extremely-preterm-born children.
Parents of 88 children born extremely preterm were contacted by telephone and interviewed by a structured questionnaire (R-PDQ) when the corrected age of their child was 9-15 mo.
We found that doxapram treatment was associated with a deficit in age-adjusted R-PDQ score.
Doxapram may have a negative effect on neurodevelopmental outcome.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) elicits both apoptotic and necrotic responses within treated tumors and produces microvascular injury leading to inflammation and hypoxia. PDT also induces expression of angiogenic and survival molecules including vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and matrix metalloproteinases. Adjunctive administration of inhibitors to these molecules improves PDT responsiveness. In the current study, we examined how the combination of PDT and COX-2 inhibitors improve treatment responsiveness. Photofrin-mediated PDT combined with either celecoxib or NS-398 increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis in mouse BA mammary carcinoma cells. Immunoblot analysis of protein extracts from PDT-treated cells also showed poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and Bcl-2 degradation, which were further enhanced following combined therapy. Tumor-bearing mice treated with PDT and either celecoxib or NS-398 exhibited significant improvement in long-term tumor-free survival when compared with PDT or COX-2 inhibitor treatments alone. The combined procedures did not increase in vivo tumor-associated apoptosis. Administration of celecoxib or NS-398 attenuated tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor induced by PDT in treated tumors and also decreased the expression of proinflammatory mediators interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Increased tumor levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10, were also observed following combined treatment. This study documents for the first time that adjunctive use of celecoxib enhances PDT-mediated tumoricidal action in an in vivo tumor model. Our results also show that administration of COX-2 inhibitors enhance in vitro photosensitization by increasing apoptosis and improve in vivo PDT responsiveness by decreasing expression of angiogenic and inflammatory molecules.
Aztreonam (SQ 26,776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam agent, was compared with several frequently used antibiotics in therapy for three types of experimental meningitis in rabbits and for experimental Escherichia coli cerebritis in rats. Aztreonam was highly active against common gram-negative meningeal pathogens in vitro (all minimal bactericidal concentrations less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), including ampicillin-sensitive and ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli, and meningococci. In both rabbits and rats, serum concentrations of all antibiotics evaluated closely approximated concentrations found in humans receiving standard parenteral regimens. The percent penetration of aztreonam into purulent rabbit cerebrospinal fluid was 23%. In experimental meningitis, aztreonam was more rapidly bactericidal than ampicillin in meningitis due to ampicillin-sensitive H. influenzae, than ampicillin or chloramphenicol in meningitis due to ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and than gentamicin in meningitis due to E. coli. Aztreonam also reduced concentrations of E. coli in rat brain as rapidly as did gentamicin during therapy for experimental cerebritis, the early stage of brain abscess formation.
To determine the effects of troglitazone on abnormal skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, muscle cultures from type II diabetic patients were grown for 4-6 weeks and then fused for 4 days either without or with troglitazone (1-5 micrograms/mL; chronic studies) or had troglitazone added for 90 min (1-5 micrograms/mL) at completion of fusion (acute studies). Acute troglitazone treatment stimulated glucose uptake, but not glycogen synthase (GS) activity 2-fold (P < 0.05) in a dose-dependent fashion and to the same extent as the addition of maximal (33 nmol/L) insulin. Maximal chronic troglitazone (5 micrograms/mL for 4 days) increased both glucose uptake (from 9.0 +/- 1.5 to 40.9 +/- 8.1 pmol/mg protein.min; P < 0.05) and GS fractional velocity (from 5.4 +/- 0.7% to 20.6 +/- 6.3%; P < 0.05) by approximately 4-fold. At each concentration of chronic troglitazone, glucose uptake rates were similar in the absence and presence of maximal (33 nmol/L) insulin concentrations. In contrast, insulin-stimulated GS activity was greater (P < 0.05) when maximal chronic troglitazone and acute insulin were combined than when chronic troglitazone alone was used. After 4 days of troglitazone, GLUT1 messenger ribonucleic acid and protein increased about 2-fold (P < 0.05) without a change in GLUT4 or GS messenger ribonucleic acid and protein. We conclude that troglitazone has both acute and chronic effects to improve skeletal muscle glucose metabolism of obese type II diabetic subjects. These effects involve direct insulin mimetic stimulatory actions as well as indirect insulin-sensitizing properties.
Pilot studies have shown that histamine H2 receptor antagonists augment the natural immunity against cancer in colorectal and gastric cancer by enhancing lymphocytic infiltration in the tumors. However, a study of adjuvant ranitidine failed to show a significant benefit in colorectal cancer, possibly because of the immunosuppression exerted by blood transfusion and post-operative infections. The pre-operative use of H2 receptor antagonists may therefore be of greater benefit. Except for a pilot study using cimetidine, there are no trials that have evaluated the effect of pre-operative H2 receptor antagonists on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in colorectal cancer.
To evaluate the efficacy of famotidine in augmenting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in colorectal cancer.
Double blind, placebo controlled, prospective randomized study.
Twenty-three patients with resectable colorectal cancer were randomized to receive famotidine (n = 11) or placebo (n = 12). Famotidine was given for 1 week pre-operatively in a dose of 40 mg per day p.o. After resection, the specimens were analyzed histologically for lymphocytic infiltration by a pathologist blinded to the two groups. Lymphocytic infiltration more than 50 cells per high power field, involving more than 50% of the tumor-normal tissue interface was considered significant.
The two groups were comparable for age, gender, pre-operative carcino embryonic antigen (CEA) levels and pathological stage. Significant lymphocytic infiltration was seen in 63.6% (7 of 11) patients in the study group compared to only 8.5% (1 of 12) patients in the placebo group (P = 0.005). Despite fewer recurrences and a longer survival in the study group, the difference was not significant.
This study shows that pre-operative famotidine may significantly enhance lymphocytic infiltration in colorectal cancer and may have potential for use as an anticancer agent in colorectal cancer.
Although, more than six million people are endemically exposed to inorganic arsenic in West Bengal, India by drinking heavily contaminated groundwater, only about 300,000 people show arsenic induced skin lesions. This suggests that genetic variability plays an important role in arsenic induced skin lesions and skin cancers. Arsenic induced keratosis is considered as a possible precancerous state of in situ carcinoma. Several reports have suggested the role of p53 polymorphisms as potential marker for risk assessment of different types of cancers. This prompted us to study the association of three p53 polymorphisms with arsenic induced keratosis in a population exposed to arsenic through drinking water. A total of 366 unrelated individuals (177 individuals with arsenic induced keratosis and 189 individuals with no arsenic induced skin lesions) were recruited from North 24 Parganas, Nadia and Murshidabad districts between January 2003 and February 2005 for the study of the genotypic distribution of three p53 polymorphisms (16bp duplication at intron 3, codon 72 Arg/Pro and G>A at intron 6 [nt 13,494]) by PCR-RFLP. The arginine homozygous genotype at codon 72, and homozygous genotype of no duplication polymorphism at intron 3 were over represented in the individuals with keratosis compared with individuals with no skin lesions (OR=2.086; 95% CI=1.318-3.299 and OR=2.086; 95% CI=1.257-3.457, respectively). This study indicates that individuals carrying the arginine homozygous genotype at codon 72, and/or no duplication homozygous genotype at intron 3 are at risk for the development of arsenic induced keratosis.
In the intestine, the vitamin D receptor is activated by 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] to perform its function in calcium homeostasis, or it is activated by lithocholic acid when its levels are elevated after a meal. Both ligands transcriptionally up-regulate the mRNA of enzymes belonging to the CYP3A subfamily, increasing the metabolism of a variety of carcinogens, drugs, and hormones. Of the cytochrome P450 enzymes, the CYP3A subfamily is the most abundant in liver and intestine and has the widest range of substrate specificity. In addition to being a ligand for the vitamin D receptor, lithocholic acid is also a substrate for CYP3A enzymes. Lithocholic acid causes colon cancer; thus, decreasing lithocholic acid levels in the intestine by up-regulating CYP3A enzymes with 1,25(OH)2 D3 analogs may have therapeutic value in the prevention of colon cancer. We investigated the induction of CYP3A9 by 1,25(OH)2D3 and 19nor-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2[19nor-1,25(OH)2 D2]. We observed the that latter analog, currently used to treat renal osteodystrophy, is more efficacious than 1,25(OH)2 D3 in inducing CYP3A9 in rat intestines. CYP3A9 mRNA was maximally elevated 5 to 7 h after a single dose of 1,25(OH)2 D3 to rats and then gradually returned to baseline. We performed promoter deletion analysis of the rat CYP3A9 promoter and identified one proximal vitamin D response element located at -119 to -133 from the transcriptional start site, which is responsible for a large part of the 1,25(OH)2D3 response, and two other vitamin D response elements located at -726 to -744 and at -754 to -776, which together are responsible for the increased sensitivity of CYP3A9 to 19nor-1,25(OH)2D2.
The role of circulating epinephrine in the regulation of renin release was studied in unanesthetized rats with glucocorticoid-induced hypertension. Biadrenalectomized Wistar rats were made hypertensive with methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg s.c. weekly) for 2 weeks and supplemented with deoxycorticosterone pivalate (10 mg/kg s.c. weekly). Sham-operated controls received the same treatment. Baseline weight, mean intra-arterial blood pressure and heart rate of the groups were the same. In both adrenalectomized and sham-operated rats plasma renin activity was determined after a 30 min infusion of the beta-adrenoceptor stimulant isoproterenol (40 ng/min) or its vehicle. Isoproterenol had no blood pressure effect and accelerated heart rate to a similar extent in rats with and without adrenals. Plasma renin activity was significantly higher in epinephrine-deficient than in sham-operated rats. Renin secretion was significantly enhanced by isoproterenol in both groups of rats. These data therefore indicate that in rats with glucocorticoid-induced hypertension the renin-angiotensin system is activated by adrenalectomy, despite the fact that adrenal insufficiency cannot develop. It also appears that rats lacking of circulating epinephrine for a prolonged period do not exhibit an abnormal responsiveness of renin secretion to the stimulation of renal beta-adrenoceptors.
Coronary and systemic circulations, and contractility and oxygen consumption of the left ventricular myocardium were depressed as arterial enflurane concentration increased in acute experiments with 22 adult mongrel dogs. Uneven transmural blood flow in the left ventricular free wall did not appear and the inner/outer ratio remained near 1.0 until a very deep stage of the anesthesia was attained and as far as diastolic aortic pressure was maintained above 40 mmHg, according to the microsphere injection study. Once diastolic pressure fell below 35--40 mmHg, the ratios started to be reduced significantly. When arterial enflurane content reached 53.0 +/- 2.1 mg/100 ml (mean +/- s.e.), the ratio became 0.84 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.001), and simultaneously calculated DPTI/TTI ratio also showed a significant redution from the control (0.79 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.001). The I/O and DPTI/TTI ratios, however, did not correlate significantly with each other until very deep enflurane anesthesia was attained. The lower limit of autoregulation of coronary vascular bed was suggested to be near 35--40 mmHg of diastolic aortic pressure during deep enflurane anesthesia in the dog. Among systolic time intervals measured directly during the study, PEP and ICT showed significant negative correlations with Vmax and LV dp/dt max, while LVET neither changed nor correlated significantly with stroke volume or other parameters representing myocardial contractility during the course of enflurane anesthesia.
Ventricular pacing was effective in controlling recurrent bouts of atypical ventricular tachycardia (Torsade de Pointes), in four patients. This arrhythmia was induced by quinidine or disopyramide therapy. Isoproterenol, which is the usually recommended therapy, was ineffective in two of the patients and was considered hazardous in two others. We consider ventricular pacing as a safe and reliable method for treatment of AVT, which should be applied if isoproterenol is ineffective or contraindicated.
A survey of patients with Tourette syndrome uncovered 32 who had been exposed to central nervous system stimulants. In 17 (53%) of these patients, symptoms were markedly accentuated by the drugs. Two patients whose Tourette syndrome developed suddenly when methylphenidate was administered are also reported.
The authors report about six patients, who after the intake of Midazolam or Triazolam suffered from an oneiroid-confusional state in which they carried out complex acts and for which an anterograde amnesia existed. In addition to these drugs, one female patient was under the influence of alcohol and one male patient of Bromazepam. Two of the patients suffered of emotional conflicts. The possibility of disinhibition of suicide and other impulses is named. The authors recommend caution in prescribing these benzodiazepines of ultrashort action.
Hexarelin (Hex) is a new synthetic hexapeptide with potent GH-releasing activity in both animals and men. We evaluated the GH response to maximal doses of Hex (2 micrograms/kg, iv) and GHRH-(1-29) (1 microgram/kg, iv) in 15 children (11 boys and 4 girls, aged 6.0-17.3 yr) and 4 adults (3 men and 1 woman, aged 20.2-30 yr) with GH deficiency (GHD). GHD was idiopathic in 8 patients and associated with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome in 8, with a pituitary cyst in 2, and with empty sella syndrome in 1. In 11 patients, GHD was isolated, whereas in 8, it was associated with other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Forty-five short normal children (24 boys and 21 girls, aged 5.9-14 yr) served as controls. In patients with idiopathic GHD, the GH response to Hex was similar to that observed in short normal children, and it was significantly higher than the response to GHRH. In the patients with GHD associated with anatomical abnormalities, the GH responses to GHRH varied from normal to absent. Among these subjects, only 1 patient with a pituitary cyst had a sizable GH response to Hex, whereas in all others, the GH response to Hex was absent or blunted compared with those in the short normal children and the patients with idiopathic GHD. In all patients except those with associated ACTH deficiency, Hex administration caused a slight, but significant, increase in cortisol concentrations. This study shows that Hex stimulates GH secretion in patients with idiopathic GHD. The inability of Hex to stimulate GH secretion in patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disconnection strongly supports the concept that in humans, the GH-releasing effect of GH-releasing peptides is mediated by the hypothalamus.
Twenty-six patients were selected for treatment with minoxidil on the basis of hypertension which could not be controlled either because of (1) drug failures and/or (2) side effects of drugs. Sixteen out of the 26 had had one or more previous episodes of malignant hypertension. Reduced renal function was present in the majority; eight patients were on dialysis. Average preminoxidil blood pressure was 202/127 mm. Hg supine and 162/106 upright which fell to 154/87 supine and 143/86 upright after minoxidil. Propranolol or methyldopa was given to control the reflex increase in heart rate. Edema and congestive heart failure refractory to large doses of potent diuretics necessitated discontinuation of the drug in two patients. Minoxidil proved highly efficacious regardless of initial level of blood pressure, etiology, or supine or upright posture.
The previous data showed that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a component of propolis, possesses inducing cell cycle arrest and antiproliferation effect on C6 glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, C6 glioma cells treated with CAPE resulted in morphological changes to an astrocytic phenotype and increased the expression of glial differentiation marker proteins including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S-100β. In addition, with scratch assay and Boyden chamber assay, CAPE exhibited inhibitory effects on the motility and invasion of C6 glioma cells. Furthermore, CAPE induced the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)), which were involved in neural cell differentiation. CAPE could also inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and induce the expression of RhoB, a tumor suppressor. To examine the involvement of p75(NTR) in the anti-invasive property of CAPE, Western blotting and Boyden Chamber assay were performed by addition of an anti-p75(NTR) antibody in C6 cells. The results showed that blocking p75(NTR) could decrease the CAPE-induced expression of RhoB and the inactivation of MMP-2, -9 as well as the anti-invasion effect in C6 glioma cells. Furthermore, CAPE suppressed IκB-α phosphorylation which was down stream of p75(NTR). Finally, the effect of CAPE on metastasis by lung colonization of the tumor cell in nude mice was also evaluated. It was found that the groups of nude mice injected with CAPE-pretreated cells could decrease both lung size and weight as compared to the positive control group which did not receive CAPE treatment. In addition, histological examination of the mouse lung sections showed that the CAPE-treated group inhibited the metastasis of C6 glioma cells. These data suggest CAPE possesses antitumor progression potential.
There is considerable variability in individual response to antihypertensive agents. The reason for this is not known, but may be related to individual genetic variability. This study examined whether the therapeutic efficacy of benazepril on essential hypertension is modified by beta2 adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) Arg16Gly (R16G) polymorphism.
We conducted a family-based study of 321 and 610 hypertensive subjects from Yuexi and Huoqiu Counties of Anhui, China, respectively. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) before and after a 15-day benazepril treatment were measured. ADRB2 R16G genotypes were determined for all subjects. ADRB2 G16 allele frequency was found to be 41.0% and. 47.4% in Huoqiu and Yuexi, respectively. In Yuexi family-based association test (FBAT) revealed that the G16 allele was associated with a greater DBP decrease in response to a 15-day benazepril treatment (Z = 2.12, P = 0.03), and the data were consistent with a dominant inheritance model. A similar trend was observed in Huoqiu Chinese, but the magnitudes of effects were smaller and did not reach statistical significance. The FBAT results were further confirmed by using a generalized estimating equation model.
Our family-based study provided the first evidence that ADRB2 R16G polymorphism may play an important role in DBP response to benazepril treatment, although the magnitude of the effect appears to be modified by other risk factors such as plasma lipid and glucose profiles.
Previously described cases of phenytoin-induced hyperkinesia are reviewed. Three new cases are reported, in one of which hyperkinesia persisted for 5 years, although serum phenytoin on several occasions was in the therapeutic range. Similarities between phenytoin-induced hyperkinesia and hyperkinesia in Huntington's chorea and in neuroleptic- and L-DOPA-treated patients are discussed. It is pointed out that the frequency of organic cerebral damage seems to be high among patients with phenytoin-induced hyperkinesia. The hypothesis is presented that phenytoin induces hyperkinesia by increasing dopaminergic and serotonergic activity in the basal ganglia, and that patients with preexisting basal ganglia damage are the most susceptible.
We studied the long-term effect of continued zidovudine exposure in mice on hematopoiesis, as determined by peripheral blood indices, assays of erythroid (colony-forming unit-erythroid [CFU-E] and burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFU-E]), myeloid (CFU-granulocyte-macrophage [GM]), megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg), and plasma titers of erythropoietin, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Dose-escalation of zidovudine (0.1, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/ml) induced a dose-dependent decrease in hematocrit, white blood cells, and platelets. High-dose drug, i.e., greater than 1.0 mg/ml, reduced marrow CFU-E; splenic CFU-E was increased after 1 week, then declined. BFU-E was increased at Weeks 1 and 2, then declined to control levels. Splenic BFU-E rose during the examination period that was dose-dependent. Femoral CFU-GM was cyclic, i.e., low-dose drug, 0.1 mg/ml, was increased gradually, the declined; higher doses of 1.0 and 2.5 mg/ml were lower until Week 5, then were above controls. Splenic CFU-GM was increased initially at Week 2 (1.0 mg/ml), then declined; the higher dose (2.5 mg/ml) increased initially, then declined below controls (Week 6). Femoral CFU-Meg was increased after low-dose drug and inhibited after high dose (2.5 mg/ml). Splenic CFU-Meg was reduced initially, followed by an increase at Week 4. Plasma titer of erythropoietin was elevated, proportional to dose escalation of drug, and inversely proportional to the hematocrit. No difference was observed in plasma levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This study demonstrates that zidovudine-induced anemia results from: (i) inadequate numbers of bone marrow-derived, erythropoietin-dependent hematopoietic progenitors, i.e., CFU-E; and (ii) a shift in erythropoietin-responsive progenitors from bone marrow to spleen capable of responding to obligatory growth factors.
C3H/2lbg mice are more sensitive to nicotine-induced seizures than are DBA/2lbg mice. There are also differences in alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) binding in the hippocampus and midbrain of these two strains, with the C3H mice having greater binding. Because alpha-BTX and nicotine appear to bind to nicotinic receptors in the central nervous system, it is possible that there may be a relationship between seizure sensitivity after a nicotine dose and nicotinic receptor concentration. To examine this relationship, a classical cross producing F1, F2 and backcross (F1 X C3H and F1 X DBA) generations from these two strains was utilized. Dose-response curves for nicotine-induced seizures were constructed for both parental strains and all crosses derived from them. Nicotinic receptors were also measured in three brain regions: cortex, midbrain and hippocampus. Both DL-[3H]nicotine and alpha-[125I]BTX were used to measure nicotinic receptors. The pattern of results for the six generations for alpha-BTX binding in the hippocampus paralleled that for seizure sensitivity. These results suggest that strain differences for both seizure sensitivity and receptor concentration in the hippocampus may be due to allelic differences at a single autosomal locus, with dominance for low seizure susceptibility and fewer alpha-BTX receptors.
The role of prostaglandins (PGs)/cyclooxygenase (COX) in the healing of indomethacin-induced small intestinal ulcers was examined in rats. Animals were given indomethacin (10 mg/kg s.c.) and killed 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days later. Indomethacin (2 mg/kg), 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-trifluoromethylpyrazole (SC560; COX-1 inhibitor; 3 mg/kg), and rofecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor; 3 mg/kg) were given p.o. once daily for 6 days, during the first 3 days or last 3 days of the experimental period. All COX inhibitors given for 6 days significantly impaired the healing of these ulcers. Healing was also impaired by rofecoxib given for the first 3 days or by SC560 given for the last 3 days. The expression of COX-2 mRNA in the intestine was up-regulated after ulceration, persisting for 3 days and dissipating thereafter. Mucosal PGE2 contents decreased within 3 h after ulceration, recovered 24 h later, and increased above normal 1 approximately 3 days later. The PGE2 content at 4 days after ulceration was decreased by rofecoxib but not SC560, whereas that at 7 days was suppressed by SC560 but not rofecoxib. Vascular content in the ulcerated mucosa decreased when the healing was impaired by COX inhibitors. The deleterious effect of indomethacin on healing was mimicked by a prostacyclin E receptor (EP) 4 antagonist and reversed by coadministration of PGE2 as well as an EP4 agonist. In conclusion, endogenous PGs play a role in the healing of intestinal ulcers through EP4 receptors, yet the COX isozyme involved differs depending on the stage of healing; COX-2 in the early stage and COX-1 in the late stage.
Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) elevates systolic blood pressure (SBP) and lowers plasma reactive nitrogen intermediates in rats. We assessed the ability of NO donation from isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to prevent or reverse the hypertension caused by ACTH. In the prevention study, male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with ACTH (0.2 mg/kg/day) or saline control for 8 days, with either concurrent ISDN (100 mg/kg/day) via the drinking water or water alone. Animals receiving ISDN via the drinking water were provided with nitrate-free water for 8 hours every day. In the reversal study ISDN (100 mg/kg) or vehicle was given as a single oral dose on day 8. SBP was measured daily by the indirect tail-cuff method in conscious, restrained rats. ACTH caused a significant increase in SBP compared with saline (P < 0.0015). In the prevention study, chronic administration of ISDN (100 mg/kg/day) did not affect the SBP in either group. In the reversal study, ISDN significantly lowered SBP in ACTH-treated rats at 1 and 2.5 hours (132 +/- 3 mmHg (1 h) and 131 +/- 2 mmHg (2.5 h) versus 143 +/- 3 mmHg (0 h), P < 0.002), but not to control levels. It had no effect in control (saline treated) rats. In conclusion, the lowering of SBP by NO donation is consistent with the notion that ACTH-induced hypertension involves an impaired bioavailability or action of NO in vivo.
Cigarette smoking is strongly correlated with the onset of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nicotine, an active component of cigarettes, has been found to induce proliferation of lung cancer cell lines. In addition, nicotine can induce angiogenesis and confer resistance to apoptosis. All these events are mediated through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on lung cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that nicotine can promote anchorage-independent growth in NSCLCs. In addition, nicotine also induces morphological changes characteristic of a migratory, invasive phenotype in NSCLCs on collagen gel. These morphological changes were similar to those induced by the promigratory growth factor VEGF. The proinvasive effects of nicotine were mediated by alpha7-nAChRs on NSCLCs. RT-PCR analysis showed that the alpha7-nAChRs were also expressed on human breast cancer and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Nicotine was found to promote proliferation and invasion in human breast cancer. The proinvasive effects of nicotine were mediated via a nAChR, Src and calcium-dependent signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. In a similar fashion, nicotine could also induce proliferation and invasion of Aspc1 pancreatic cancer cells. Most importantly, nicotine could induce changes in gene expression consistent with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), characterized by reduction of epithelial markers like E-cadherin expression, ZO-1 staining and concomitant increase in levels of mesenchymal proteins like vimentin and fibronectin in human breast and lung cancer cells. Therefore, it is probable that the ability of nicotine to induce invasion and EMT may contribute to the progression of breast and lung cancers.
