To study the auditory impairment induced by prenatal administration of aminoglycosides in the offspring, the shuttle box method to measure the auditory threshold of rats (Kameyama et al., Folia pharmacol. japon. 77, 15, 1981) was employed. Four groups of pregnant rats were administered 200 mg/kg kanamycin sulfate (KM), 200 mg/kg dihydrostreptomycin sulfate (DHSM), 100 mg/kg neomycin sulfate (NM), or 1 ml/kg saline intramuscularly from the 10th to the 19th day of pregnancy. The auditory threshold of the offspring could be measured by the shuttle box method in about 90% of the live born rats at the age of 100 days. The auditory thresholds of the groups were as follows (mean +/- S.E.): saline group, 53.8 +/- 0.6 dB (N = 36); KM group, 63.8 +/- 1.1 dB (N = 34); DHSM group, 60.0 +/- 1.2 dB (N = 29); NM group, 62.4 +/- 1.2 dB (N = 24). Auditory thresholds of drug-treated groups were significantly higher than that of the saline group. However, no increase in the auditory threshold of the mother rat was detected after treatment with aminoglycosides. In addition, the experimental procedure of the shuttle box method is very easy, and the auditory threshold of a large number of rats could be measured in a short period. These findings suggest that this method is a very useful one for screening for auditory impairment induced by prenatal drug treatment in rat offspring.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new regimen for the treatment of multiple myeloma based on alternating 3-week cycles of chemotherapy and interferon (rIFN alpha 2). In this prospective phase II clinical trial the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group evaluated a regimen consisting of 2 cycles of VBMCP (Vincristine 1.2 mg/M(2) IV d1, BCNU 20 mg/M(2) IV d1, Melphalan 8 mg/M(2) PO dl-4, Cyclophosphamide 400 mg/M2 IV d1, Prednisone 40 mg/M(2) PO d1-7) followed by alternating 3-week cycles of VBMCP and rIFN alpha2 5 Mu/M(2) SC 3x/week. Treatment was administered for 2 years. Fifty-eight patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma were entered. Objective response (OR) required 50% decrease in M-protein with correction of severe anemia and no progression of skeletal disease. Complete remission (CR) was defined by disappearance of M-protein and normalization of the bone marrow morphology. Life table analysis was utilized to express survival and response duration. Fifty-four patients were evaluable. Objective response was seen in 80% of patients including CR in 30% (16 patients). The median response duration is 35 months, 46 months for patients with CR. The median survival is 42 months for all patients. Five year survival is 42%. Although 78% of patients had neutrophil nadirs <1000 x 10(9)/L, the incidence of severe infection was only 9%. These data demonstrate that VBMCP + interferon is an effective new regimen combining chemotherapy with a biological response modifier for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The incidence of CR is high, and the response and survival durations appear to be 1 year longer than usually seen with standard chemotherapy. A current ECOG randomized trial compares VBMCP + interferon with VBMCP alone.
It is very important to study the effects of pesticides on reproduction. Dicofol, an organochlorine pesticide, was administered orally at doses of 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg body weight to normal virgin rats for 30 days. There was no significant change in the number of estrous cycles and duration of each phase with 20 mg dicofol. However, there was a significant decrease in number of cycles, duration of proestrus and diestrus, and increase in the duration of the estrus phase after dicofol treatment at 30, 40 and 50 mg. Body weight and organ weight of liver, kidney, adrenal, ovary, uterus thyroid and thymus were not significantly changed in all the dicofol treated rats. There was a significant decrease in healthy follicles with concomitant increase in atretic follicles at higher doses of dicofol treatment. Hence, the effect of dicofol was dose dependent.
This experiment examined the effects of the GABA-B agonist baclofen on flash-evoked potentials (FEPs) recorded from both the visual cortex (VC) and superior colliculus (SC) of chronically implanted male Long-Evans rats. FEPs were recorded at 5, 25, 45, and 65 min following intraperitoneal injections of saline, and of 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg baclofen on separate days. In the VC, the amplitude of components P(23), P(37), N(55), N(150), and P(242) increased, while the amplitude of components N(31) and P(48) decreased following baclofen administration. P(88) was unchanged. In the SC, components P(28), N(49), N(55), and N(59) were reduced in amplitude, while P(39) was unaffected by baclofen. These effects on amplitudes were dose- and time-dependent. Many peak latencies in the VC and SC were altered by baclofen, although there was no obvious pattern of change, with some decreasing, a few increasing, and others unchanged. Body temperature was recorded in a separate group of animals, with both the 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg doses of baclofen producing significant hypothermia. The 10.0 mg/kg dose of baclofen resulted in a significant decrease in movement during the recording sessions, but not in subsequent open field observations. The results show the involvement of GABA-B receptors in the production/modulation of the various components of FEPs.
This study details the prevention of gentamicin-induced hearing loss in guinea pig in vivo. The approach is based on our recent demonstrations of a redox-active gentamicin-iron complex in vitro and partial attenuation of gentamicin-induced hearing loss by the iron chelators deferoxamine and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. In our study, guinea pigs receiving injections of gentamicin (120 mg/kg body weight daily x 19 days) developed a progressive threshold shift reaching 50 to 70 dB at 18 kHz. Concurrent treatment with different doses of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (30-300 mg/kg/day) reduced the threshold shift to 25 to 15 dB. Coinjection of gentamicin with dihydroxybenzoate (100 mg/kg/day) plus mannitol (15 mg/kg/day) yielded complete functional and morphological protection from gentamicin ototoxicity although partial protection was observed with combinations of dihydroxybenzoate and deferoxamine. Dihydroxybenzoate also attenuated gentamicin-induced vestibular toxicity. The iron chelators and radical scavengers affected neither serum levels nor the antimicrobial efficacy of gentamicin against Escherichia coli. These results confirm that iron and free radicals play a crucial role in the toxic side effects of gentamicin. Furthermore, they suggest that iron chelators, which are well-established drugs in clinical therapy, may be promising therapeutic agents to reduce aminoglycoside ototoxicity.
The promotion potential of phenobarbital (PB) and 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB) on liver carcinogenesis after initiation with various doses of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was assessed using an in vivo short term system. Male F344 rats were pretreated with a single intraperitoneal injection of varying doses of DEN (0, 6, 12, 25, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg body wt), and 2 weeks later were treated with 0.05% PB or 0.06% 3'-Me-DAB for 6 weeks. All animals were subjected to partial hepatectomy 3 weeks after the DEN treatment. Quantitation of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive (gamma-GT+) foci revealed a DEN dose-dependent response. Magnitude of promotion by PB and more pronounced by 3'-Me-DAB was, in contrast, strongest at the lower doses of DEN. The results suggest that quantitative differences with regard to initiation level may exist, influencing the promotability of initiated cells.
Alveolar macrophages (AMs) may play a key role in human respiratory immune defenses, partially by synthesizing and releasing interleukin 1 (IL = 1). D53 (Ribomunyl), a composite bacterial ribosomal immunostimulant, has been recognized as an efficient prevention of respiratory tract infections. In vitro, D53 enhances the IL-1 production by mouse spleen adherent cells. A thymocyte proliferative response assay was used to evaluate the in vitro IL-1 production by AMs in healthy subjects who received D53 immunostimulant. Twelve nonsmoking healthy subjects took part in a prospective double-blind placebo control study. On day 1, a first bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to assess IL-1 production by unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated AM. Then, subjects were randomized to receive D53 (n = 6) or its placebo (n = 6) by both oral and subcutaneous injection routes from day 1 to day 15. On day 15, a second BAL was done and AM IL-1 production was again tested. IL-1 production on day 15 did not significantly differ from day 1 in both D53-treated and placebo groups either when AMs were unstimulated or were stimulated with concentrations of LPS resulting in maximal IL-1 production. However, in the D53-treated group, but not in the placebo group, IL-1 production induced by low LPS concentration (5 mg/L) was significantly higher (mean +/- SEM: 1,238 +/- 287 U/10(6) AM) on day 15 in comparison with day 1 (577 +/- 113 U/10(6) AM; p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon W test) and in comparison with the control group (day 15 IL-1 production induced by 5 mg/L LPS, 758 +/- 175 U/10(6) AM; p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Moreover, in the D53-treated group, the optimal LPS concentration (ie, LPS concentration that induced maximal IL-1 production) was significantly lower on day 15 (mean +/- SD: 11 +/- 7 mg/L) than on day 1 (16 +/- 7 mg/L; p less than 0.05 Wilcoxon W test). We conclude that D53 immunostimulant in vivo primes AM to produce IL-1 following low LPS concentration stimulation. This may partially explain the protective effect of D53 immunostimulant against respiratory tract infection.
Correlations between quantitative kidney biopsy findings and clinical renal function in 46 unselected patients treated with lithium for an average of eight years were studied. A significant relationship between maximum renal concentrating capacity and degree of tubular atrophy was found. GFR correlated significantly with sclerotic glomeruli as well as atrophic tubules in patients on a multiple dosage schedule, whereas no relationship was seen in patients receiving lithium in a single daily dose. Thus, renal dysfunction may have a structural basis in a subgroup of lithium-treated patients on a multiple dosage schedule.
The relationships between brain and blood concentrations of lindane and its convulsant effects have been studied in rats after different po and ip doses. A good correlation was observed between dose and the frequency and time to onset of tonic seizures, the intensity of the response and lethality. An oral ED50 (84 mg/kg) and an ip ED50 (131 mg/kg) for the half-maximal incidence rate of lindane-induced tonic seizures was determined. The incidence of response was directly proportional to the log of lindane concentration in brain and blood, with an EC50 of 5.3 micrograms/g and 1.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The threshold concentration of lindane eliciting tonic seizures was estimated to be approximately 5 micrograms/g in brain and approximately 1.5 micrograms/ml in blood. The kinetics of lindane in brain and blood were examined after a single 60 mg/kg po or ip dose over a period from 5 min to 1 week. Concentrations of lindane in brain and blood were found to be highly correlated.
We report the case of a patient referred to us for mitral and aortic valvular disease with a rheumatic appearance. The unusual macroscopic appearance on valve resection was not compatible with a rheumatic cause. A detailed review of this patient's clinical history (ie, a history of treatment with fenfluramine) suggested an iatrogenic cause, which was confirmed by histology. For the first time, a case of valvular heart disease that deteriorated was discovered 7 years after treatment with fenfluramine, whereas this iatrogenic disease classically resolves after discontinuation of treatment. This case illustrates the need for continuing heart valve surveillance of patients who have used these anorectics.
Two cases of clinically manifest liver failure in patients with metastatic prostatic cancer treated with the non-steroidal antiandrogen flutamide combined with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue are described. One patient developed severe hepatic insufficiency with jaundice, ascites and hepatic coma. The condition reversed after discontinuation of flutamide. The other patient only became jaundiced with a biochemical cholestatic pattern. Previous reports of hepatic adverse reactions only include elevated transaminase levels without clinical manifestations. The morphological lesions in the liver biopsy and the clinical condition may be due to a reversible interaction with metabolic processes in the hepatocytes.
To evaluate whether the use of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the prevention of recurrent preterm deliveries is cost-effective.
Using decision-analysis modeling, we compared the cost-effectiveness of using 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in four subgroups: 1) Prior preterm deliveries less than 32 weeks; 2) prior preterm deliveries 32-37 weeks; 3) prior term delivery; and 4) no prior delivery. Each subgroup was compared with a "no treatment" group. Costs included those for 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, hospital admissions, and complications from preterm deliveries. The main outcome measures include cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained and the number of preterm deliveries prevented. Secondary outcomes include neonatal complications prevented. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were performed.
The use of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the prevention of preterm deliveries result in cost-savings in women with prior preterm deliveries less than 32 weeks and 32-37 weeks. The sensitivity analyses revealed the model to be robust over a wide range of values for evaluated variables.
Within our baseline assumptions, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate was associated with cost-savings when used for the prevention of preterm deliveries in women with prior preterm deliveries.
Although combination therapy for various cardiac conditions with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and thienopyridine derivatives) and warfarin sodium has become increasingly popular, the safety and effectiveness of this aggressive treatment regimen remain unknown.
We retrospectively enrolled and analyzed 575 consecutive patients who had been implanted with drug-eluting coronary stents. The primary and secondary endpoints were major bleeding complications and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), respectively. At the time of discharge, 525 patients (91.3%) were prescribed with dual antiplatelet therapy, and 50 (8.7%) of them received dual antiplatelet plus anticoagulant therapy (triple therapy). The patients treated with triple therapy had a greater prevalence of comorbid conditions, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction and multi-vessel coronary disease compared to those on the dual antiplatelet regimen. During a median follow-up of 459 days, 14 (2.7%) patients receiving dual, and 9 (18.0%) receiving triple therapy reached the primary endpoint (p<0.001). These results show that warfarin use was associated with an increased risk of subsequent major bleeding. On the other hand, the incidence of MACE did not differ between the two groups (p=0.108 by the log-rank test). Multivariate analysis showed that renal impairment was an independent predictor of the risk of subsequent major bleeding in the triple therapy group.
Triple therapy increased the hemorrhagic complications in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents, especially in patients with impaired renal function. Great caution should be taken with patients who necessitate the addition of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin to dual antiplatelet therapy.
Amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCD; Amphocil) was evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation study in 75 marrow transplant patients with invasive fungal infections (primarily Aspergillus or Candida species) to determine the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose, and clinical response. Escalating doses of 0.5-8.0 mg/kg in 0.5-mg/kg/patient increments were given up to 6 weeks. No infusion-related toxicities were observed in 32% of the patients; 52% had grade 2 and 5% had grade 3 toxicity. No appreciable renal toxicity was observed at any dose level. The estimated maximum tolerated dose was 7.5 mg/kg, defined by rigors and chills and hypotension in 3 of 5 patients at 8.0 mg/kg. The complete or partial response rate across dose levels and infection types was 52%. For specific types of infections, 53% of patients with fungemia had complete responses, and 52% of patients with pneumonia had complete or partial responses. ABCD was safe at doses to 7.5 mg/kg and had tolerable-infusion-related toxicity and demonstrable antifungal activity.
As cocaine abuse has become widespread, it has been associated with various cardiovascular complications, including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine's principal effects on the cardiovascular system are mediated via alpha-adrenergic stimulation and include (1) an increase in the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand (heart rate and systemic arterial pressure), and (2) a concomitant decrease in myocardial oxygen supply (caused by vasoconstriction of the epicardial coronary arteries). beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate cocaine-induced coronary arterial vasoconstriction, thereby increasing the magnitude of myocardial ischemia. In contrast, nitroglycerin and verapamil reverse cocaine-induced hypertension and coronary arterial vasoconstriction; therefore, they are the agents of choice in treating patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.
Tyrosine phosphorylation is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. We performed a mutational analysis of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) gene family in cutaneous metastatic melanoma. We identified 30 somatic mutations affecting the kinase domains of 19 PTKs and subsequently evaluated the entire coding regions of the genes encoding these 19 PTKs for somatic mutations in 79 melanoma samples. We found ERBB4 mutations in 19% of individuals with melanoma and found mutations in two other kinases (FLT1 and PTK2B) in 10% of individuals with melanomas. We examined seven missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTK gene, ERBB4, and found that they resulted in increased kinase activity and transformation ability. Melanoma cells expressing mutant ERBB4 had reduced cell growth after shRNA-mediated knockdown of ERBB4 or treatment with the ERBB inhibitor lapatinib. These studies could lead to personalized therapeutics specifically targeting the kinases that are mutationally altered in individual melanomas.
Mequindox (MEQ) is a synthetic quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides (QdNOs) derivative which can effectively improve growth and feed efficiency in animals. This study was to investigate the dose-dependent long-term toxicity in the adrenal of male rats exposed to 180 days of MEQ feed. Our data demonstrated that high doses of MEQ in the diet for 180 days led to adrenal damage and steroid hormone decrease, combined with sodium decrease and potassium increase in rat plasma. Significant changes of GSH and SOD in plasma were observed in the high doses (110, 275 mg/kg) groups. At the same doses, MEQ treatment down-regulated the mRNA levels of CYP11A1, CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 which located in mitochondria, but up-regulated mRNA levels of CYP21 and 3beta-HSD which located in endoplasmic reticulum. In conclusion, we reported the dose-dependent long-term toxicity of MEQ on adrenal gland in male rats, which raise awareness of its toxic effects to animals and consumers, and its mechanism may involve in oxidative stress and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway.
In the present study, we report 11 cases of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) in patients living in the Federal District who had not left their area of residence for a period ranging from six months to two years before the onset of the disease. Six of the eleven patients live in the suburban town of Planaltina. All showed a positive Leishmanin intradermal reaction. Ten of them presented the parasite in their lesions. Leishmania (V) braziliensi was identified in the lesions of two patients by the monoclonal antibody method. Nine patients were treated with pentavalent antimoy and two with pentamidine. Relapse occurred in two cases after treatment with antimony. In view of the detection of vectors and infected patients in the Federal District, it is probable that Leishmania infection is occurring in Brasilia and its suburban areas.
To investigate whether etanidazole and cisplatin can be given safely together and to evaluate the relationship between incidence of peripheral neuropathy and cumulative exposure to etanidazole and cisplatin, as well as other toxicities and treatment outcome.
Thirty-two previously untreated patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer were entered on a Phase I study of etanidazole combined with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Cisplatin/5-FU (two cycles, weeks 1 and 4) and etanidazole (weeks 2, 3 and 5) were given concurrently with radiation therapy. Eligible patients then underwent surgical resection. All patients were scheduled to receive two additional cycles of cisplatin/5-FU chemotherapy after completion of radiation therapy (definitive arm) or surgery (preoperative arm).
Of 19 fully evaluable patients, nine (47%) developed peripheral neuropathy. Six of six patients, 65 years or older, experienced peripheral neuropathy, compared with three of 13 patients less than 65 years old (p = .003). For patients younger than 65 years, two of the two patients with single dose area under the curve (AUC) > 4.0 mMhr experienced peripheral neuropathy, compared with one of 11 patients with single-dose AUC < 4.0 mMhr (p = .03). Grade 4 toxicity included neutropenia (23%) and thrombocytopenia (26%). No other Grade 4 toxicity was observed. The pathologic complete response rate in patients who underwent surgical resection was 29%.
This regime of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and etanidazole had acceptable toxicity. However, combining etanidazole and cisplatin appears to increase the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy for at least some categories of patients. Further studies of these interactions are needed.
The aim of this open-label pilot study was to evaluate the utility of divalproex in decreasing cocaine use and stabilizing mood symptoms among patients with bipolar disorder with comorbid cocaine dependence.
Fifteen patients enrolled in the study and seven met final inclusion criteria of DSM-IV/SCID diagnoses of bipolar I disorder and comorbid cocaine dependence with active cocaine use. Patients were started on open-label divalproex. After stabilization on divalproex sodium, weekly assessments were undertaken for 8weeks. Subjects also attended dual recovery counseling.
The results revealed significant improvement on % cocaine abstinent days, dollars spent on cocaine, ASI's drug use severity index, % alcohol abstinent days, drinks per drinking day, marijuana use and cigarettes smoking. They also had significant improvement on manic, depressive, and sleep symptoms and on functioning. There were no reported adverse events or increases in liver function tests.
The results of this open-label study point to the potential utility of divalproex in patients with bipolar disorder and primary cocaine dependence. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to fully evaluate the efficacy of divalproex in this high risk clinical population are warranted.
To compare the effectiveness, side effects, and acceptability of medical abortions induced by methotrexate and misoprostol with abortions induced by mifepristone and misoprostol.
This was a multicenter, randomized, nonblinded, controlled trial comparing 50 mg/m(2) of methotrexate followed 4-6 days later by 800 microgram of vaginal misoprostol with 600 mg of oral mifepristone followed 36-48 hours by 400 microgram of oral misoprostol.
There were 518 women in the methotrexate group and 524 women in the mifepristone group. In the methotrexate group, 21 women required suction curretage, two for continuing pregnancy, eight because of physician request (usually for excessive bleeding), and 11 because of patient request. In the mifepristone group, 22 women needed surgical termination, 17 because of physician request, and five because of patient request. By day 8, only 386 (74.5%) in the methotrexate group had completed the abortion compared with 474 (90.5%) in the mifepristone group, and the mean number of days from beginning to completion was 7.1 for methotrexate and 3.3 for mifepristone (P </=.001). There were no differences in complications, and side effects were similar. Acceptance was slightly higher with mifepristone (88.0%) than with methotrexate (83.2%).
Abortions induced with mifepristone completed faster than those induced with methotrexate, but the overall success rates, side effects, and complications were similar. Acceptance rates were slightly higher with mifepristone than methotrexate (P =.03).
