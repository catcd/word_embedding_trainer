The effect of single oral doses of atenolol (100 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), propranolol (40 mg), and placebo on exercise tachycardia and on heart rate and finger tremor responses to graded injections of isoproterenol was investigated in six normal subjects. Propranolol was more potent than atenolol and metoprolol in suppressing the increase in heart rate and tremor amplitude produced by isoproterenol, even though at the dose used it was the least effective of all three drugs in decreasing exercise tachycardia. Although these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the suppression of isoproterenol-induced tremor is mediated by antagonism of peripheral beta 2-adrenergic receptors, the possibility that a separate action other than beta-blockade may contribute to the tremorolytic action of propranolol cannot be excluded. The potential usefulness of examining the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs on isoproterenol-induced tremor and tachycardia in cardioselectivity studies is discussed.
Cocaine use often has profound effects on the body. Medical complications that may be seen in users include headache, sexual dysfunction, violent behavior, chronic cough, seizures, and myocardial infarction. The type of cocaine used and the method of use often determine the kind of problems that occur. Patients may be reluctant or unable to offer information about their drug use during evaluation, so awareness of the medical consequences of cocaine use and a high index of suspicion are essential.
Isoniazid-induced seizures respond poorly to anticonvulsants but well to pyridoxine (Vitamin B6); theophylline produces difficult-to-treat seizures with substantial morbidity and mortality. Theophylline therapy depresses plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), the active metabolite of pyridoxine, suggesting that theophylline-induced seizures might be amenable to treatment with pyridoxine. Our study established the dose-response relationship for convulsions due to isoniazid and theophylline in mice and determined if pyridoxine antagonized such seizures. Female CD-1 outbred mice weighing 25 to 30 g were used. Clonic seizures had clonic activity lasting 5 sec; tonic seizures had loss of the righting reflex with tonic hindlimb extension. Groups of 10 mice received single doses of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300 mg aminophylline/kg i.p. or 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 or 350 mg isoniazid/kg i.p. and were observed for seizures or death. Pyridoxine or saline with aminophylline or isoniazid were administered simultaneously. The LD50 for aminophylline was 266 mg/kg; for isoniazid it was 160 mg/kg. Doses of 150 mg aminophylline/kg or 100 mg isoniazid/kg did not induce seizures. Pyridoxine with aminophylline or isoniazid did not alter the frequency or time of onset of seizures or death. This was unexpected because pyridoxine antagonizes theophylline-induced seizures in mice and reverses isoniazid-induced seizures in humans. We found no evidence that PLP depletion in mice is a mechanism for seizures induced by isoniazid or aminophylline in a fashion similar to isoniazid in humans.
Nasal septoplasty is a surgical procedure offered to patients with chronic snoring secondary to nasal obstruction. We describe a case of cardiogenic shock following the administration of metoprolol to treat hypertension, (likely) induced by systemic absorption of topical epinephrine used during a routine nasal septoplasty.
A 29-yr-old male, with no significant medical history, was scheduled for nasal septoplasty for mild nasal obstruction. Following routine anesthetic induction, cotton balls, soaked with epinephrine (1:1000), were applied to the nasal mucosa. The patient became hypertensive with a blood pressure of 207/123 mmHg. Intravenous metoprolol was administered. Severe pulmonary edema ensued, with resulting hypoxic respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care facility for percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass. After five days of cardiopulmonary bypass support and six weeks of intensive care monitoring, the patient's cardiac status returned to normal limits.
A hypertensive response, following systemically absorbed topical vasoconstrictors, including both phenylephrine and epinephrine, can be associated with dire consequences when treated with a beta-adrenergic blocking drug and, possibly, calcium channel blockers. To prevent severe complications including; pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and, possibly, death, these drug interactions need to be appreciated.
Neural tube defects (NTD) are serious congenital abnormalities that have a multifactorial etiology, including both genetic and environmental effectors (for example, diet and/or drugs). Valproic acid (VPA) is a frequently used anti-epileptic drug that has a potentially teratogenic character, as well as the capacity for inducing NTD and other less serious malformations. However, the mechanism of action of VPA has not been clearly established, and it has been suggested that it interferes in the folate cycle and therefore, with the methionine/methylation, possibly through a metabolic blocking of some biomarker that is a key of the cycle, such as for example S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and folic acid (FA). The objective of the present study is to analyze the morphological and histological changes, which can occur in a high risk experimental model after the administration of VPA as well as for the induction of NTD and other malformations. In addition, the protective roles of the administration of folic acid, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (FOL) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) are assessed. For this pregnant "Wistar" rats classified according to the following treatments: 1) VPA (300 mg/kg/day on days 8, 9, and 10 of the pregnancy); II) VPA (300 mg/kg/day on days 8, 9, and 10 of the pregnancy) and FOL (4 mg/kg/day i.p. on days 8, 9, and 10 of the pregnancy); III) VPA (300 mg/kg/day on days 8, 9, and 10 of the pregnancy) + SAM (10 mg/kg/day, on days 1-10 of the pregnancy); IV) CONTROL (no treatment). VPA decreases the fertility index by 25% compared to the control group, it increases the number of reabsorptions by mother (1.3 +/- 0.5 vs 1.0 +/- 0.5), and decreases the number of fetuses compared to the control (9.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 12.6 +/- 0.9). In the VPA + FOL group, the numbers for these parameters approach those of the control group and the VPA + SAM group is no different from the VPA group, showing no protective factors. With respect to the bone alterations observed, when these are grouped according to whether they affect the skull, trunk, and extremities, it is seen that there are no significant differences between the groups. The histological study and the immunohistochemical analysis show liver alterations in all groups treated, and a lower number of lymphocytes in the VPA group, and a greater number of Kupffer cells, The results are discussed in relation to, first, the effect of VPA per se in the interference of the methionine/methylation cycle, and secondly, with regard to how folic acid and/or S-adenosylmethionine can improve or not some of the harmful effects induced by VPA.
The use of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol has been widely recommended to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension. We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial of metoprolol, a selective beta-blocker for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding from portal hypertension in 29 non-selected patients with liver disease and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. Fifteen patients received placebo treatment for 40 +/- 18 months and 14 patients received metoprolol for 31 +/- 17 months. A sustained reduction in resting pulse was observed in those patients treated with metoprolol. There was no significant difference in acute re-bleeding episodes between the two groups. Of the 14 patients treated with metoprolol, three (21%) re-bled, all three requiring blood transfusion. Four (26.5%) of the 15 patients treated with the placebo re-bled, two cases with acute bleeding and the remaining two cases presented a positive stool guaiac test. All cases who bled during the metoprolol therapy required exclusion from the trial, and surgical procedures or sclerotherapy as well. After both metoprolol or placebo treatments, similar deterioration of standard liver function tests was observed. Further, at the end of the trial, 11 patients on metoprolol (78%) and four of the patients treated with the placebo (27%) required treatment for clinical portal-systemic encephalopathy (p < 0.01). The risk of poor sympathomimetic response after cardioselective beta 1-blocker during acute bleeding episodes and the appearance of hepatic encephalopathy deserve further investigation. The selective beta-blocker metoprolol seems to be an inadequate choice to prevent gastrointestinal re-bleeding in patients with portal hypertension.
A patient with valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy presented with altered mental status and hyperammonemia in the context of normal liver functions. Fortunately, altered mental status and elevated plasma ammonia level normalized 1 day after discontinuation of divalproex sodium (Depakote). The case analysis suggests a possible synergistic interaction of valproic acid and topiramate with respect to the emergence of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in the context of normal liver functions. Possible mechanisms of the encephalopathy and hyperammonemia are discussed. For example, valproate has diverse metabolic effects that include regulating levels of ammonia by altering activity of the urea cycle, whose first step uses HCO3 in the synthesis of carbamoylphosphate. Topiramate's inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity may be the basis of its possible synergy with valproate by affecting levels of HCO3.
Repeated intraperitoneal administration of benzene (1.0 ml/kg body wt) for 3 days produced leucopenia, lymphocytopenia and an increased number of nucleated cells in the bone marrow and significantly decreased organ weights of thymus (P less than 0.001) and spleen (P less than 0.001) in female albino rats. Iron content, lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase activity of the liver and bone marrow were significantly increased as a result of benzene exposure. Prior administration of 6MFA, an interferon inducer with immunomodulating potential, was found to ameliorate some of the adverse effects of benzene as well as restoration of hepatic architecture histologically. Lipid peroxidation and iron content were both normalised, whereas superoxide dismutase activity was further increased and the number of lymphocytes and bone marrow cells returned to normal. Pretreatment of animals with 6MFA was able to enhance the SRBC antibody titre in benzene-treated immunosuppressed animals. The beneficial effects of 6MFA in the amelioration of the acute toxicity of benzene therefore assume certain significance.
HBV-related chronic liver disease patients often present with hepatic decompensation and are not eligible for interferon therapy. Whether long-term lamivudine is effective in these patients was prospectively evaluated.
Eighteen patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis, all with quantitative DNA +ve and 10 HBeAg +ve, were given lamivudine 150 mg/d.
Each patient received at least 9 months (mean 17.9) of lamivudine. Three HBeAg+ve patients (30%) seroconverted to anti-HBe and one lost HBsAg during the follow-up. An improvement from baseline in the aspartate aminotransferase (130 vs. 72 IU/l, p<0.04); alanine aminotransferase (111 vs. 58 IU/l, p<0.01) and Child-Pugh score (8.3 vs 6.7, p<0.013) was seen. Lamivudine had no significant side-effects. HBV DNA became undetectable in all patients by 8 weeks of therapy. In three (17%) patients, HBV DNA again became positive at 9, 9 and 27 months. YMDD mutant was, however, detected in only one (6%). A significant reduction was noted in the morbidity and hospitalizations for complications of liver disease before and after starting lamivudine (1.5+/-0.7 vs. 0.6+/-0.7, p<0.002).
In decompensated HBV-related cirrhosis, lamivudine: i) is effective in suppressing HBV DNA and seroconversion to anti-HBe (30%), ii) can achieve significant improvement in clinical and biochemical status of liver functions.
Methyl bromide is a genotoxic soil fumigant with high acute toxicity, but unknown human carcinogenicity. Although many countries have reduced methyl bromide use because of its ozone depleting properties, some uses remain in the United States and other countries, warranting further investigation of human health effects.
We used Poisson regression to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for associations between methyl bromide use and all cancers combined, as well as 12 specific sites, among 53,588 Agricultural Health Study pesticide applicators with follow-up from 1993 to 2007. We also evaluated interactions with a family history for four common cancers (prostate, lung, colon, and lymphohematopoietic). We categorized methyl bromide exposure based on lifetime days applied weighted by an intensity score.
A total of 7,814 applicators (14.6 %) used methyl bromide, predominantly before enrollment. Based on 15 exposed cases, stomach cancer risk increased monotonically with increasing methyl bromide use (RR = 1.42; 95 % CI, 0.51-3.95 and RR = 3.13; 95 % CI, 1.25-7.80 for low and high use compared with no use; p (trend) = 0.02). No other sites displayed a significant monotonic pattern. Although we previously observed an association with prostate cancer (follow-up through 1999), the association did not persist with longer follow-up. We observed a nonsignificant elevated risk of prostate cancer with methyl bromide use among those with a family history of prostate cancer, but the interaction with a family history did not achieve statistical significance.
Our results provide little evidence of methyl bromide associations with cancer risk for most sites examined; however, we observed a significant exposure-dependent increase in stomach cancer risk. Small numbers of exposed cases and declining methyl bromide use might have influenced our findings. Further study is needed in more recently exposed populations to expand on these results.
The emergency department (ED) evaluation of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome (CAACS) is often a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.
We are reporting on the treatment of a patient with cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome (CAACS) who did not benefit from standard therapy, but who eventually responded positively to phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist.
This report should encourage physicians to add phentolamine to their pharmacotherapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of CAACS.
Extrapyramidal symptoms and Parkinsonism (PS) are side effects commonly observed with antipsychotic treatment. However, about 24% of never-treated schizophrenic patients may suffer from PS, which contrast with that 1% observed from the general population. 123I-FP-CIT SPECT has probe useful to differentiate degenerative from non-degenerative PS, so it could be interesting using it for establishing the functional state of presynaptic dopamine neurons of these patients.
To determine the dopamine transporter binding (DAT) in a homogeneous group of first-episode schizophrenic patients.
An open, transversal study. Thirty schizophrenic in-patients and 15 healthy subjects were recruited. Patients were treated with similar doses of risperidone and all subjects were scanned with 123I-FP-CIT. Extrapyramidal symptoms and psychopathological status was assessed by Simpson-Angus, CGI and PANSS. Semi-quantitative analyses of SPECT images were performed using ROIs placed in caudate nucleus, anterior, medium and posterior putamen and occipital cortex.
Whole striatum 123I-FP-CIT binding ratio was significantly lower in patients than healthy subjects (t = 2.56, p < 0.014). This was observed in whole putamen (t = 2.66, p < 0.011), anterior (t = 2.35, p < 0.023), medium (t = 2.38, p < 0.022) and posterior putamen (t = 2.09, p < 0.042). No differences were observed in caudate nucleus (t = 1.81, p = 0.076). Females obtained higher binding ratios than males (t = -3.13, p < 0.003). No correlation was observed between 123I-FP-CIT binding ratios and clinical scales.
In our series, first episode schizophrenic patients treated with risperidone have a decrease striatal DAT binding assessed with 123I-FP-CIT SPECT. This alteration could be related to their own schizophrenia disease or be secondary to the antipsychotic treatment.
Organophosphates (OPs), which are widely used as pesticides, are acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors. The inactivation of AChE results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites, causing a cholinergic crisis that can lead to death. The classical treatment for OP poisoning is administration of oximes, but these compounds are ineffective in some cases. Here we determined whether the new compound isatin-3-N(4)-benzilthiosemicarbazone (IBTC), which in our previous study proved to be an antioxidant and antiatherogenic molecule, could protect and reactivate AChE and BChE. Toxicity of IBTC after subcutaneous injection in mice was measured using assays for oxidized diclorofluoresceine (DCF), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels, and catalase (CAT), sodium potassium (Na(+)/K(+)) ATPase, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D), and glutathione peroxidases (GPx) enzyme activities. The cytotoxicity was evaluated and the enzymatic activity of cholinesterase was measured in human blood samples. Molecular docking was used to predict the mechanism of IBTC interactions with the AChE active site. We found that IBTC did not increase the amount of DCF-RS or TBARS, did not reduce NPSH levels, and did not increase CAT, (Na(+)/K(+)) ATPase, ALA-D, or GPx activities. IBTC protected and reactivated both AChE and BChE activities. Molecular docking predicted that IBTC is positioned at the peripheral anionic site and in the acyl binding pocket of AChE and can interact with methamidophos, releasing the enzyme's active site. Our results suggest that IBTC, besides being an antioxidant and a promising antiatherogenic agent, is a non-toxic molecule for methamidophos poisoning treatment.
Azathioprine hepatotoxicity has been described mainly in renal transplant recipients. Most reported cases are related to lesions of the venous system of the liver: peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. The most common clinical manifestation of these hepatic vascular lesions is portal hypertension. We present a case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and perivenous fibrosis in a patient receiving azathioprine for multiple sclerosis. Histological abnormalities were similar to those described in renal transplant patients, and azathioprine was the only potential hepatotoxic agent present.
We report a 46-year-old woman who has been suffered from myasthenia gravis and underwent thymomectomy in December 1988. Her myasthenic symptoms improved by treatment with corticosteroid and azathioprine; the latter drug was administrated for more than one year. She noticed weight gain of 10 kg and edema in both legs and feet, which developed acutely in August 1994. Laboratory data showed that she suffered from nephrotic syndrome with a large amount of proteinuria (15 g/day). Renal biopsy revealed that biopsied glomeruli showed early stage of membranous nephropathy associated with acute tubular necrosis. Although therapeutic trials of steroid pulses could not eliminate proteinuria, substitution of cyclophosphamide for azathioprine brought marked improvement of the nephrotic syndrome with disappearance of the urinary protein excretion within 10 days. From reports of similar cases with myasthenia gravis in Japan and in Europe, therapeutic usage of azathioprine in patients with myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma should be cautious for appearance of nephrotic syndrome when azathioprine is continued for more than one year.
Asthma and allergic rhinitis are common conditions, occurring with increasing prevalence and frequently coexist. In both conditions histamine and cysteinil leukotrienes are important pathogenic inflammatory mediators. We evaluated the effects of the leukotriene receptor antagonist zafirlukast, 20mg administered twice daily for 2 weeks, in patients with allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma during the grass pollen season. Patients underwent skin prick testing, spirometry, rhinomanometry, mucus transport test with saccharine, nasal epithelial brushing to study ciliary beat and, finally, nasal lavage.Thirty-five subjects completed the study. At the end of the study period, zafirlukast significantly reduced asthma and rhinitis symptoms (P< or =0.05); FEV(1) values were unchanged (P=0.10), whereas nasal resistances showed a decrease following treatment (P=0.01). Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) also improved (P=0.00), although mucociliary transport showed no improvement (P=0.87). The number of eosinophils in nasal lavage fluid decreased (P=0.00) while that of neutrophils was unchanged (P=0.09). These positive effects suggest that zafirlukast may be usefully employed in the treatment of both bronchial asthma, as previously demonstrated, and allergic rhinitis.
Hiccups have been classified as a neurologic reaction triggered by a multitude of factors. There are only a few reports of persistent hiccups associated with oral and intravenous corticosteroid use in the medical literature. It has been proposed that corticosteroids lower the threshold for synaptic transmission in the midbrain and directly stimulate the hiccup reflex arc. There is a recent report of progesterone-induced hiccups, which were thought to occur secondary to the glucocorticoid-like effects of progesterone on the brainstem. We report the first case of anabolic steroid-induced hiccups occurring in an elite power lifter. The hiccups occurred within 12 hours of the individual increasing his doses of oral anabolic steroids and persisted for 12 consecutive hours until medical attention was sought. In this report the pathophysiology of anabolic steroid-induced hiccups is discussed, and the postulated relationships of steroids and the hiccup reflex arc reviewed.
Compartment syndrome as a result of simvastatin-induced myositis is extremely rare. This case discusses a patient with spontaneous onset compartment syndrome that necessitated four-compartment fasciotomy. A thorough investigation into its cause highlighted statin-induced myositis as the most likely aetiological agent. When investigating a patient with unexplained spontaneous compartment syndrome it is important to consider drug-induced myositis. This case reinforces the difficulty faced in diagnosing spontaneous compartment syndrome.
Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) have been shown to activate endothelial cells (EC) in vitro, as documented by an increased expression of tissue factor as well as leukocyte adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and E-selectin. Currently, treatment of patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome includes aspirin, particularly for women with recurrent fetal loss.
The present study was undertaken to investigate whether aspirin interferes with EC activation induced by APLA in vitro.
IgG from 14 patients with APLA, and suffering from thrombotic complications and/or pregnancy morbidity, and control IgG were tested for their ability to modify the expression of VCAM-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. VCAM-1 antigen was measured by flow cytometry and its mRNA by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Incubation of EC with IgG from most of the patients led to a higher VCAM-1 expression compared with incubation with control IgG. The effect of aspirin was studied for the eight IgG samples that induced a more than 50% increase in VCAM-1. Aspirin (10 mm) treatment of the cells significantly reduced the VCAM-1 response to these APLA.
Our results indicate that besides its antiplatelet properties, aspirin exerts a protective effect towards APLA at the EC level by decreasing leukocyte adhesion molecule expression at the cell surface.
In Alzheimer's disease (AD) a reduction in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and an increase in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity are observed. K variant (539T) is the most common variant of the BCHE gene and, although controversial, several studies reported association between K variant and AD. Previous results showed that the K variant alone is not capable of diminishing BChE activity, depending on the presence of the -116A variant. Considering that, we conducted a case-control association study using a clinically well defined group of AD patients (n = 82) and age and sex matched control subjects (EC; n = 78) in order to test the association with these variations of BCHE gene in a Brazilian population. The allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of the K and the -116A variants of BCHE gene were not significantly different between cases and controls. Although not reaching statistical significance, the results suggested that the presence of -116A variant may have a protective effect against AD. The association of the K variant with AD in a controversial manner in different surveys is probably caused by its linkage disequilibrium with -116A that, by reducing BChE activity, potentially increases cholinergic transmission in comparison with usual genotypes.
Antioxidative roles of metallothionein (MT) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) have been studied. Since pretreatment of rat with dexamethasone, an inhibitor of cytokine production, prevented MT synthesis induced by paraquat which is a typical superoxide generator, MT synthesis by oxidative stress may be, at least partly, mediated through cytokines. Pretreatment of rat with TNF or IL-6 prevented liver damage and lipid peroxidation caused by carbon tetrachloride. Administration of TNF increased activity of mitochondrial Mn-SOD and concentrations of cytoplasmic MT, but not activities of glutathione peroxidases and Cu,Zn-SOD in the liver. The increment of the Mn-SOD activity and MT was due to the de novo protein synthesis, because gene expression of mRNAs of Mn-SOD and MT in the liver was also induced by TNF and IL-6. These data strongly suggest that MT and Mn-SOD in the liver cooperatively play antioxidative roles. Pretreatment with TNF, however, did not affect the increased levels of plasma fibrinogen and liver MT induced by the following paraquat treatment, although it did prevent lipid peroxidation in the liver. The data suggest that MT is not directly induced by oxygen free radicals. Cytokines may be released by paraquat in tissues other than the liver and induce hepatic synthesis of acute phase proteins including fibrinogen, MT, and Mn-SOD. MT and Mn-SOD induced by cytokines in the liver exert an antioxidative role during acute phase response, therefore preventing tissues from injury by oxidative stress.
Capecitabine (Xeloda) is an oral 5-fluorouracil pro-drug used in the treatment of two of the commonest cancers: breast and colorectal. This report concerns a 43-year-old woman with metastatic cancer of the sigmoid colon who developed cardiac chest pain 5 days after starting capecitabine therapy. Capecitabine-induced cardiac symptoms have previously been reported but infrequently. In the main they have documented pain and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes associated with exercise. This case report is of a patient with minimal cardiac risk factors, who had ischaemic cardiac pain with widespread ECG changes at rest that resolved with a nitrate infusion. Coronary vasospasm is proposed as the probable mechanism for the cardiac ischaemia and dramatic ECG changes. Capecitabine is now in widespread use and so physicians will encounter an increasing number of patients using this therapy. In the light of this, it is important that doctors in emergency and acute medicine are aware of its treatable cardiac side effects.
Caspases are key mediators in liver inflammation and apoptosis. In the present study we provide evidence that a nitric oxide (NO) derivative of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), NCX-1000 ([2-(acetyloxy)benzoic acid 3-(nitrooxymethyl)phenyl ester]), protects against liver damage in murine models of autoimmune hepatitis induced by i.v. injection of Con A or a Fas agonistic antibody, Jo2. Con A administration causes CD4(+) T lymphocytes to accumulate in the liver and up-regulates FasL expression, resulting in FasL-mediated cytotoxicity. Cotreating mice with NCX-1000, but not with UDCA, protected against liver damage induced by Con A and Jo2, inhibited IL-1beta, IL-18, and IFN-gamma release and caspase 3, 8, and 9 activation. Studies on HepG2 cells demonstrated that NCX-1000, but not UDCA, directly prevented multiple caspase activation induced by Jo2. Incubating HepG2 cells with NCX-1000 resulted in intracellular NO formation and a DTT-reversible inhibition of proapoptotic caspases, suggesting that cysteine S-nitrosylation was the main mechanism responsible for caspase inhibition. Collectively, these data suggest that NCX-1000 protects against T helper 1-mediated liver injury by inhibiting both the proapoptotic and the proinflammatory branches of the caspase superfamily.
Six patients receiving thiazide diuretics were referred for evaluation of mild to moderate hypercalcaemia (serum calcium 2.65-2.98 mmol/l). All patients were considered to be suffering from primary hyperparathyroidism. Withdrawal of the diuretic was followed by a reduction in the serum calcium, one patient becoming normocalcaemia. The mechanisms responsible for these changes are discussed. In hypercalcaemic patients taking thiazides, it is recommended that the effects of withholding the diuretic should be observed before more radical measures are considered.
High doses of intrathecally applied morphine or morphine-3beta-D-glucuronide (M3G) produce allodynia and hyperalgesia. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from substantia gelatinosa neurons in transverse slices of adult rat lumbar spinal cord to compare the actions of M3G with those of the mu-opioid agonist, DAMGO ([D-Ala(2),N-Met-Phe(4),Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin), and the ORL(1) agonist, nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ). M3G (1-100 microM) had little or no effect on evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) and no effect on postsynaptic membrane conductance. In contrast, 1 microM DAMGO and 1 microM N/OFQ reduced the amplitude of evoked EPSCs and activated an inwardly rectifying K(+) conductance. M3G did not attenuate the effect of DAMGO or N/OFQ on evoked EPSC amplitude. However, 1 to 100 microM M3G reduced the amplitude of evoked GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) by up to 48%. This effect was naloxone-insensitive. The evoked IPSC was also attenuated by DAMGO, but not by N/OFQ. Because M3G reduced the frequency of tetrodotoxin-insensitive miniature IPSCs and increased paired-pulse facilitation, it appeared to act presynaptically to disinhibit substantia gelatinosa neurons. This effect, which does not appear to involve mu-opioid or ORL(1) receptors, may contribute to the allodynia and hyperalgesia observed after intrathecal application of high doses of morphine.
