We present a 52-year-old woman who developed a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II) with deep vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia and skin necrosis 7 days after initiating subcutaneous prophylaxis with 2 x 5000 U of unfractionated heparin. The platelet count fell from an initial value of 233 x 10(9)/L to 57 x 10(9)/L and normalized within 3 days after stopping heparin. Oral phenprocoumon was started, and her further course was uneventful. The pathogenesis and diagnosis of HIT II is illustrated, and the possible therapeutic options are discussed. To prevent this potentially lethal complication, it is important to begin oral anticoagulation on the first or second day of heparinization, and to stop heparin if the INR-value has been within a therapeutic range for 2 consecutive days. Platelet counts must be checked after 5 to 7 days of heparin therapy. In the case of suspected HIT II, a diagnostic test has to be performed, the heparin must be stopped, and an anticoagulation with either danaparoid or lepirudin is recommended.
Ischemia reperfusion injury associated with apoptosis and inflammation plays crucial roles in renal transplantation. Erythropoietin provides renoprotection, but its effects and mechanisms on kidney preservation are not fully defined. Porcine kidneys, subjected to 10 min warm ischemia, underwent 16 h cold storage followed by 2 h normothermic hemoperfusion with or without 5000 units/L erythropoietin. Apoptotic cells were increased in tubular lumens and interstitial areas by normothermic perfusion alone, but decreased in tubular areas by additional erythropoietin. Myeloperoxidase+ cells, free cells and cell debris in tubular lumens were gradually increased by cold storage, normothermic perfusion and erythropoietin in normothermic perfusion. Accordingly, caspase-3 activity as well as its active proteins was increased by normothermic perfusion and furthered by erythropoietin. In contrast, macrophage L1 protein positive cells in tubulointerstitial areas, cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β activation, tubular dilation and vacuolation were raised by normothermic perfusion, but all alleviated by erythropoietin, with higher urine output. The migration of myeloperoxidase+ cells with apoptotic features and apoptotic cells with polymorphous nuclei from tubulointerstitial areas into tubular lumens was widely displayed in the kidneys, especially those preserved by erythropoietin in normothermic perfusion. HSP70 protein was enhanced by normothermic perfusion regardless of erythropoietin. In addition, erythropoietin induced a dose-dependent increase in caspase-3 precursor in porcine proximal tubular cells (LLC-PK1) and also stimulated caspase-3 cleavage in cisplatin-treated cells. In conclusion, erythropoietin promotes inflammatory cell apoptosis, drives inflammatory and apoptotic cells into tubular lumens, eventually leads to inflammation clearance, renoprotection and tissue remodelling through caspase-3 and IL-1β in isolated haemoperfused kidneys.
Data on adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage uterine sarcomas are conflicting and most often based on small patient groups with relatively short duration of follow-up. Approximately 60% of patients present with stage I disease with an overall 5-year survival of 30-50% when treated with surgery alone. This study examines the efficacy and results of long-term follow-up of a multiagent chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine (CYVADIC) as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage I uterine sarcoma. Between 1982 and 1999, 24 evaluable patients with completely staged uterine sarcomas received adjuvant multiagent chemotherapy with vincristine sulfate (1mg /m(2)) on days 1 and 4, doxorubicin (40 mg /m(2)) and cyclophosphamide (400 mg /m(2)) on day 2, and dacarbazine (200 mg /m(2)) on days 1 through 4 for a total of nine monthly cycles or until recurrence of disease was documented. Survival distributions were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and statistical significance was determined with the log-rank test. Factors significant on univariate analysis were analyzed in a multivariate fashion using Cox proportional hazards model. The histologic distribution of patients was 46% leiomyosarcoma, 33% mixed mullerian tumors, 13% stromal sarcomas, 4% adenosarcomas, and 4% hemangiosarcoma. The patients received 206 of a planned 216 cycles of chemotherapy. The median follow-up of the patient population was 93 months (range 11-213 months). Eight patients (33%) developed recurrent disease. The median time to recurrence was 19 months (range 7-184 months). The estimated survival for the entire group was 88, 75, and 69% at 2, 5, and 15 years, respectively. Factors that did not affect survival included age, histology, and tumor grade. Four patients required dose reductions secondary to grade 2-3 toxicities (hematologic). Grade 1 neurotoxicity was observed in six patients (25%) and grade 2 neurotoxicity in one patient (4%). Adjuvant CYVADIC chemotherapy appears to be safe and well tolerated in patients with stage I uterine sarcomas. Our data provide information on the longest duration of follow-up ever reported and suggests that CYVADIC may have a potential role in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage uterine sarcoma.
Two different hepatoma cell lines were incubated for 48h with chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin, paclitaxel and 5-FU to determine their ability to induce cytotoxicity and DNA fragmentation as well as to modify the expression of some cell death-related genes that could be involved in the resistance to therapy. We observed that cisplatin and paclitaxel induced cytotoxicity, but significant differences between both cell lines, were found only in the case of paclitaxel. At 48h, apoptosis was clearly present in Hep3B cells treated with cisplatin and HepG2 cells treated with paclitaxel. 5-FU induced cytotoxicity in both cell lines but only at higher concentrations than the other two drugs, triggering apoptosis and necrosis in HepG2 cells and only necrosis in Hep3B. When a time course was performed for the first 8h of treatment to elucidate the initial mechanism of cell death responsible for DNA fragmentation, we observed that 5-FU in Hep3B, and cisplatin in both cell lines, induces primary necrosis, whereas at the concentration tested here, paclitaxel clearly triggers apoptosis in both cell lines. HepG2 cells were weakly sensitive to 5-FU in the first 8h of treatment, so the primary mechanism of cell death was not clear, but results seem to indicate that it could be apoptosis. At 48h, Bax was not up-regulated with any of the treatments, whereas cisplatin was able to induce Bcl-xL down-regulation in both cell lines. Treatment with 5-FU also down-regulated Bcl-xL in HepG2 cells. We also measured variations in the expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis that has also been involved in mitototic catastrophe. Hep3B cells seem to show an increase in protein levels with all treatments. Exposure to paclitaxel resulted in the highest effect. In the case of HepG2 cells, there was a decrease in survivin expression when cells were treated with 5FU and paclitaxel, both treatments showing complete loss of the protein. Using an antibody that recognizes unprocessed caspase-3, we observed that the enzyme was assumingly activated in HepG2 cells treated with 5FU and paclitaxel, but only weakly after treatment with cisplatin. Hep3B cells did not show activation since the levels of the pro-enzyme remained the same as that in the control. In conclusion, the three drugs tested in this study could induce cell death, with paclitaxel being more effective inducing apoptosis. 5FU was only effective at high doses and its mechanism seems to be primarily related to necrosis in Hep3B and probably apoptosis in HepG2. Cisplatin mechanism of cell death is probably mediated by the decrease in anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL whereas paclitaxel and 5FU are decreasing the apoptosis inhibitor survivin. According to pro-enzyme levels, caspase-3 was only activated in HepG2 cells, whereas in the case of Hep3B cells the mechanisms of toxicity appear to be caspase-3-independent at the time and concentrations tested in this study. The resistance of Hep3B cells to death induced by chemotherapy could be related to an increase in the expression of IAP survivin, which can decrease cell response to the treatment or even switch the type of death from apoptosis to another kind, making therapy less efficient.
Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition, which has become nowadays a substantial public health problem. The past decade has witnessed a sustained search for an effective pharmacotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cocaine dependence. While administration of cocaine acutely increases intercellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels by blocking their presynaptic reuptake, chronic cocaine abuse leads to down-regulation of monoamine systems. Post-cocaine use depression and cocaine craving may be linked to this down-regulation. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy, by augmenting monoamine levels, may alleviate cocaine abstinence symptomatology, as well as relieving dysphoria and associated craving by general antidepressant action.
To conduct a systematic review of all RCTs on the use of antidepressants for treating cocaine dependence.
We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966 - 2000), EMBASE (from 1980 - 2000), LILACS (from 1982 - 2000), PsycLIT (from 1974 - 2000), Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). Other searches:reference searching; personal communication; conference abstracts; unpublished trials from pharmaceutical industry; book chapters on treatment of cocaine dependence.
The inclusion criteria for all randomised controlled trials were that they should focus on the use of antidepressants on the treatment of cocaine dependence. Trials including patients with additional diagnosis such as opiate dependence were also eligible.
The reviewers extracted the data independently and Relative Risks, weighted mean difference and number needed to treat were estimated. The reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement and tested the sensitivity of the final results to this assumption.
18 studies were included in the review, with 1177 people randomised. Positive urine sample for cocaine metabolites was the main efficacy outcome, with no significant results obtained regardless the type of antidepressant. Compared to other drugs, desipramine performed better but showing just a non significant trend with heterogeneity present as revealed by the chi-square test (8.6, df=3; p=0.04). One single trial showed imipramine performed better than placebo in terms of clinical response according to patient's self-report. A similar rate of patients remaining in treatment was found for both patients taking desipramine or placebo. Results from one single trial suggest fluoxetine patients on SSRIs are less likely to dropout. Similar results were obtained for trials where patients had additional diagnosis of opioid dependence and/or were in methadone maintenance treatment.
There is no current evidence supporting the clinical use of antidepressants in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Given the high rate of dropouts in this population, clinicians may consider adding psychotherapeutic supportive measures aiming to keep patients in treatment.
Health beneficial effects of xanthohumol have been reported, and basic research provided evidence for anti-cancer effects. Furthermore, xanthohumol was shown to inhibit the migration of endothelial cells. Therefore, this study investigated the anti-metastatic potential of xanthohumol. MCF-7 breast cancer spheroids which are placed on lymphendothelial cells (LECs) induce "circular chemorepellent-induced defects" (CCIDs) in the LEC monolayer resembling gates for intravasating tumour bulks at an early step of lymph node colonisation. NF-κB reporter-, EROD-, SELE-, 12(S)-HETE- and adhesion assays were performed to investigate the anti-metastatic properties of xanthohumol. Western blot analyses were used to elucidate the mechanisms inhibiting CCID formation. Xanthohumol inhibited the activity of CYP, SELE and NF-kB and consequently, the formation of CCIDs at low micromolar concentrations. More specifically, xanthohumol affected ICAM-1 expression and adherence of MCF-7 cells to LECs, which is a prerequisite for CCID formation. Furthermore, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and of cell mobility such as paxillin, MCL2 and S100A4 were suppressed by xanthohumol. Xanthohumol attenuated tumour cell-mediated defects at the lymphendothelial barrier and inhibited EMT-like effects thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for the anti-intravasative/anti-metastatic properties of xanthohumol.
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors appear to be involved in the behavioral toxic effects of cocaine. Therefore, different classes of NMDA receptor antagonists were compared for their ability to attenuate cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality in male, Swiss Webster mice. The mice were pre-treated (i.p.) with vehicle or an antagonist from one of the following classes: NMDA/glycine site antagonist (7-chlorokynurenic acid, ACEA-1021, ACEA-1031, ACEA-1328, DCQX, R(+)-HA-966), competitive antagonist (CPP, D-AP7), channel blocker (MK-801, memantine), or allosteric modulator (ifenprodil, CP-101,606, Co 101022, haloperidol). After a 15 min pre-treatment period, the mice were administered a convulsive (60 mg/kg, i.p.) or lethal (125 mg/kg, i.p.) dose of cocaine, equivalent to the calculated ED/LD97 values. Pre-treatment with competitive or NMDA/glycine site antagonists dose-dependently attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality (P<0.05). Pre-treatment with channel blockers or allosteric modulators of the NMDA receptor protected against cocaine-induced convulsions (P<0.05), but were ineffective or less effective than the competitive and glycine site antagonists in preventing death. The glutamate release inhibitor riluzole failed to prevent both the convulsions and lethality induced by cocaine. Significantly, post-treatment with NMDA/glycine site antagonists (ACEA-1021, ACEA-1031, ACEA-1328) after a cocaine overdose prevented death in a significant number of animals. The data suggest that NMDA receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of a cocaine overdose.
We report a patient with antithyroid drug-induced progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss associated with myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA). While antithyroid drugs have been linked to MPO-ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis, sensorineural hearing loss rarely was noted. A 36-year-old man treated for hyperthyroidism with propylthiouracil (PTU) developed progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by fever and arthritis. MPO-ANCA were demonstrated in serum. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions test results suggested dysfunction of outer hair cells of the organ of Corti. Inner ear blood flow impairment from ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis presumably caused cochlear dysfunction. PTU withdrawal and high-dose methylprednisolone administration greatly improved hearing on both sides.
The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and striatal dopamine (DA) depletion in BALB/cAnNcrj (BALB/c) mice following a neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine (METH) was investigated. METH-treatment (4 mg/kg x 4, 2 h intervals, s.c.) induced a significant hyperthermia and a persistent depletion of striatal DA levels 72 h after the treatment. COX-2, a marker of the cytotoxic effect of inflammation and oxidative stress and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) were significantly induced in the striatum 72 h after the METH-treatment, but not in the hippocampus. These results suggest that COX-2 may participate in METH-induced neurotoxicity in striatum.
Unfractionated heparin sodium (UFH) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody (HIT antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown.
The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation. We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to UFH (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3. The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level. HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks.
The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)/L, respectively. Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)/L on POD 4 to 65 x 10(9)/L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10(9)/L on POD 7 to 33 x 10(9)/L on POD 9, respectively. The heparin-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients. The percentage of HIT antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14. None of the subjects/patients developed UFH-related HIT.
In our series, the occurrence of HIT after liver transplantation was uncommon.
We investigated the microtubulin inhibitor vinflunine—with trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive patients—as first-line metastatic breast cancer therapy. HER2-negative patients received vinflunine on day 1; HER2-positive patients received vinflunine/trastuzumab every 21 days. Forty-eight patients in each treatment group were planned; the sponsor terminated the study early. Thirty-two evaluable patients (vinflunine, 11; vinflunine/trastuzumab, 21) were enrolled. In HER2-positive patients, vinflunine/trastuzumab produced an objective response rate (33%), clinical benefit rate (71%), and progression-free survival (6.2 months). Grade-3/4 neutropenia occurred in 14 (44%) patients; gastrointestinal toxicities were common and six patients were hospitalized for treatment-related toxicity. The vinflunine/trastuzumab combination was active and well tolerated, but our results do not suggest advantages over taxane/trastuzumab or vinorelbine/trastuzumab.
The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of liver failure in association with antidiabetic treatment using pioglitazone vs. other oral antidiabetic medications.
The study was a retrospective analysis of claim data from the PharMetrics Patient-Centric Database that had over 1.12 million enrollees with type 2 diabetes. All patients, > or =18 years of age with type 2 diabetes, who had initiated treatment either with a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), sulfonylurea or metformin were identified and matched on the basis of propensity scores, which served as a proxy for severity of disease. The primary measure of interest was the incidence of liver failure or hepatitis post-index date. In addition to unadjusted comparisons, Cox proportional hazard models were employed to estimate the risk of developing liver failure or hepatitis.
There was no significant difference in the 1- and 2-year incidence rates of liver failure or hepatitis (primary and secondary diagnoses) between the pioglitazone monotherapy group and the respective comparator groups. In Cox proportional hazard models controlling for age, pre-index total healthcare costs, Charlson comorbidity index, procedures and a hospitalization or Emergency room (ER) visit for pre-index hyperglycaemia, and pioglitazone were not associated with an increased risk of liver failure or hepatitis, compared to all other defined groups. Furthermore, no primary or secondary diagnosis of liver failure was reported in the pioglitazone group during the follow-up period.
Results of retrospective data analysis demonstrate no evidence of increased risk of liver failure or hepatitis for patients initiating therapy on pioglitazone, compared to other oral antidiabetic agents. Pioglitazone therapy was not associated with an increased risk of liver failure at 2 years relative to other oral antidiabetic therapies.
To study whether induction of prolonged (>30-min duration) in vitro electrographic seizure discharges resembling status epilepticus (SE) is graded or all-or-none, and to determine the critical factors mediating SE induction.
Prolonged electrographic seizure discharges were induced in combined hippocampal-entorhinal cortical (HEC) brain slices by electrical stimulation of the Schaeffer collaterals. Discharges were recorded by using field-potential electrodes in the dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1, and entorhinal cortex. Slices were prepared from rats that were (a). 21- to 30-day-old naive, (b). 60- to 120-day old naive, (c). epileptic, and (d). status post a prior traumatic brain injury.
Induction of SE discharges was dependent on the duration, but not amplitude of the preceding stimulus train-induced afterdischarge in HEC slices from 21- to 30-day-old control, brain-injured, and epileptic animals, but not from 60- to 120-day-old animals. In slices from 21- to 30-day-old control animals, once afterdischarges exceeded 4 min in duration, SE was induced in 50% of slices, and after >or=6 min 37 s seizure activity; SE was induced in 95% of slices. A defined SE threshold also was evident in brain-damaged rats, including rats in which an epileptic condition was induced by pilocarpine injection 4-16 weeks before recording, and rats subjected to a fluid percussive head trauma 1-8 weeks before recording. However, in these brain-damaged animals, mean SE threshold was considerably lower (24 and 44 s, respectively). HEC slices from 60- to 120-day-old controls for the brain-injured and epileptic animals did not develop SE even after 20 stimulations, demonstrating the pronounced effect of brain injury and epilepsy on the development of SE in the HEC slice preparation compared with that in age-matched controls.
In vitro, SE discharges have a defined temporal threshold for initiation. Once a seizure exceeds 6-7 min in duration in control animals, and 30-55 s in brain-damaged animals, the probability of SE induction is greatly increased. This demonstrates that brain injury lowers the afterdischarge duration required to produce SE and suggests that brains injured from trauma or SE are more susceptible to develop status epilepticus.
A 30-year-old woman underwent laparotomy and was placed on a seven-day course of metronidazole and ampicillin postoperatively. Chloroquine therapy for malaria was instituted on the sixth day and the patient developed acute dystonic reactions after a single dose. Diphenhydramine therapy before chloroquine administration did not prevent the development of the dystonic reactions. The extrapyramidal symptoms subsided upon diazepam administration and chloroquine withdrawal even though metronidazole therapy was continued. The mechanism of this adverse drug reaction based on the pharmacodynamic interaction between chloroquine and metronidazole is discussed. It is suggested that the combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine be used in place of chloroquine for malaria chemotherapy in patients on metronidazole therapy.
Psychiatric side-effects associated with acyclovir therapy are very rare in the medical literature. We present a case of depression with paranoid delusions in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that appeared after intravenous acyclovir treatment for herpes simplex infection. The clinical picture resolved following discontinuation of acyclovir and treatment with haloperidol and maprotiline. The patient's status was intact at an eight-month follow-up check. The few reports of psychiatric disorders due to acyclovir are reviewed and discussed.
We tested the ventilatory and anxiety response to hypercapneic (CO2) challenge in women with panic disorder as well as in normal women in the premenstrual phase and mid-points of their menstrual cycles. Panic disorder patients were challenged on two occasions, each time while in the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, receiving an open trial of alprazolam through the intervening 8 weeks between tests. This study confirms previous reports indicating increased sensitivity to CO2 in patients with panic disorder and that this sensitivity can be attenuated by treatment. We found a significant decrease in the ventilatory response of panic disorder patients comparing pre- and post-therapy. We also observed that normal females, while in the premenstrual phase of their menstrual cycle, have a heightened anxiety response to CO2 challenge.
Although numerous studies have described the accumulation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2) NPs) in the liver, kidneys, lung, spleen, and brain, and the corresponding damage, it is unclear whether or not TiO(2) NPs can be translocated to the ovary and cause ovarian injury, thus impairing fertility. In the current study, ovarian injury and gene-expressed characteristics in female mice induced by intragastric administration of TiO(2) NPs (10mg/kg) for 90 consecutive days were investigated. Our findings indicated that TiO(2) NPs can accumulate in the ovary and result in ovarian damage, cause an imbalance of mineral element distribution and sex hormones, decrease fertility or the pregnancy rate and oxidative stress in mice. Microarray analysis showed that in ovaries from mice treated with TiO(2) NPs compared to controls, 223 genes of known function were up-regulated, while 65 ovarian genes were down-regulated. The increased expression of Cyp17a1 following TiO(2) NPs treatment suggested that the increase in estradiol biosynthesis may be a consequence of increased TiO(2) NPs. In addition, the elevated expression of Akr1c18 implied that progesterone metabolism was accelerated, thus causing a decrease in the progesterone concentration. Taken together, the apparent regulation of key ovarian genes supports the hypothesis that TiO(2) NPs directly affects ovarian function.
An iron chelate, ferric ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetate [Fe(III)-EDDA], was found to produce hydroxyl radicals with hydrogen peroxide, as determined by both a deoxyribose degradation test and electron spin resonance. Hydroxyl radical production was inhibited not only by adding hydroxyl radical scavengers and catalase, but also by adding superoxide dismutase to the reaction mixture, suggesting that superoxide anion may be involved in the hydroxyl radical production. A single injection of Fe(III)-EDDA (10 mg Fe/kg body wt) to Wistar rats induced thiobarbituric acid reactivity in the kidneys and liver. Repeated injections of Fe(III)-EDDA (10 mg Fe/kg body wt, twice weekly for 3 months) induced a 40% incidence of renal tumors, including renal adenocarcinoma and renal adenoma, 1 year later. These results suggest that Fe(III)-EDDA is an effective free radical producer in vitro and in vivo and that it may be useful in preparing animal models related to iron-dependent free radical damage. The results support our hypothesis that endogenous or exogenous iron, complexed with certain kinds of chelators, promotes free radical-dependent tissue damage and ultimately leads to carcinogenesis in the affected tissue.
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive phospholipid, plays an important role in lung inflammation by inducing the release of chemokines and lipid mediators. Our previous studies have shown that LPA induces the secretion of interleukin-8 and prostaglandin E(2) in lung epithelial cells. Here, we demonstrate that LPA receptors contribute to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. Pretreatment with LPA receptor antagonist Ki16425 or downregulation of LPA receptor 1 (LPA(1)) by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, I-κB kinase, and I-κB in MLE12 epithelial cells. In addition, the blocking of LPA(1) also suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 production. Furthermore, LPS treatment promoted interaction between LPA(1) and CD14, a LPS coreceptor, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Disruption of lipid rafts attenuated the interaction between LPA(1) and CD14. Mice challenged with LPS increased plasma LPA levels and enhanced expression of LPA receptors in lung tissues. To further investigate the role of LPA receptors in LPS-induced inflammation, wild-type, or LPA(1)-deficient mice, or wild-type mice pretreated with Ki16425 were intratracheally challenged with LPS for 24 h. Knock down or inhibition of LPA(1) decreased LPS-induced IL-6 release in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and infiltration of cells into alveolar space compared with wild-type mice. However, no significant differences in total protein concentration in BAL fluids were observed. These results showed that knock down or inhibition of LPA(1) offered significant protection against LPS-induced lung inflammation but not against pulmonary leak as observed in the murine model for lung injury.
We have investigated the mechanism of indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the gastroprotective effect of curcumin thereon. Curcumin dose-dependently blocks indomethacin-induced gastric lesions, showing 82% protection at 25 mg/kg. Indomethacin-induced oxidative damage by ROS as shown by increased lipid peroxidation and thiol depletion is almost completely blocked by curcumin. Indomethacin causes nearly fivefold increase in hydroxyl radical (()OH) and significant inactivation of gastric mucosal peroxidase to elevate endogenous H(2)O(2) and H(2)O(2)-derived ()OH, which is prevented by curcumin. In vitro studies indicate that indomethacin inactivates peroxidase irreversibly only in presence of H(2)O(2) by acting as a suicidal substrate. 5,5-Dimethyl-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) protects the peroxidase, indicating involvement of indomethacin radical in the inactivation. Indomethacin radical was also detected in the peroxidase-indomethacin-H(2)O(2) system as DMPO adduct (a(N) = 15 G, a(beta)(H) = 16 G) by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Curcumin protects the peroxidase in a concentration-dependent manner and consumes H(2)O(2) for its oxidation as a suitable substrate of the peroxidase, thereby blocking indomethacin oxidation. Curcumin can also scavenge ()OH in vitro. We suggest that curcumin protects gastric damage by efficient removal of H(2)O(2) and H(2)O(2) -derived ()OH by preventing peroxidase inactivation by indomethacin.
We have analyzed the TbAT1 gene, which codes for the P2 adenosine transporter, from Trypanosoma brucei field isolates to investigate a possible link between the presence of mutations in this gene and melarsoprol treatment failure. Of 65 T. b. gambiense isolates analyzed from a focus in north-western Uganda with high treatment failure rates following melarsoprol therapy, 38 had a mutated TbAT1. Unexpectedly, all individual isolates contained the same set of nine mutations in their TbAT1 genes. Of these, five point mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions, one resulted in the deletion of an entire codon, and three were silent point mutations. Eight of these mutations had previously been reported in a laboratory-derived Cymelarsan-resistant T. b. brucei clone. Identical sets of mutations were also found in a drug-resistant T.b.rhodesiense isolate from south-eastern Uganda and in a T.b.gambiense isolate from a relapsing patient from northern Angola. A deletion of the TbAT1 gene was found in a single T. b. gambiense isolate from a relapsing patient from northern Angola. The data presented demonstrate the surprising finding that trypanosomes from individual relapse patients of one area, as well as from geographically distant localities, contain an identical set of point mutations in the transporter gene TbAT1. They further demonstrate that many isolates from relapse patients contained the wild-type TbAT1 genes, suggesting that melarsoprol refractoriness is not solely due to a mutational inactivation of TbAT1.
