In 104 premedicated patients undergoing general surgery, anaesthesia was induced either with etomidate 0.3 mg kg-1 preceded by fentanyl 1.25 or 2.5 microgram kg-1 i.v.or diazepam 0.0625 or 0.125 mg kg-1 i.v., or with thiopentone preceded by fentanyl 1.25 microgram kg-1 i.v. Despite the use of fentanyl or diazepam, the frequency of pain on injection in patients receiving etomidate was between 32% and 53%, being rated as severe in 5-20% of patients. No pain was experienced by patients receiving thiopentone. The frequency of involuntary movement was 15-35% with etomidate and 15% with thiopentone. The frequency of both pain and involuntary muscle movements was least when fentanyl 2.5 microgram kg-1 preceded the administration of etomidate. There was no significant relationship between the pain and muscle movement; three of 10 patients given etomidate into a central vein had such movements.
The effect of premedication upon the induction of anaesthesia with etomidate was studied in 74 adult patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. Premedication with fentanyl plus atropine or with diazepam plus atropine decreased the frequency of involuntary muscle movements without modifying the pattern of the circulatory effects of etomidate, although fentanyl increased the frequency of apnoea. Pain at the site of injection was not modified by premedication.
To investigate the correlation between decrease of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) activity and hypokalemia induced by furosemide (Fur) in rats.
SD rats were given single dose or successive doses of Fur by gavage. The activity of 11beta-HSD was evaluated by measuring the ratio of 11-dehydrocorticosterone (A) and corticosterone (B) in urine and conversion rate of B to A in renal cortex microsome preparation was determined with HPLC.
After giving single dose of Fur (40, 100, and 250 mg/kg) or multiple doses of Fur (10, 20, and 100 mg/kg, bid x 20 d), the ratio of A/B was reduced by 29.0 %, 58.6 %, and 60.9 % at 0 - 2 h; 14.4 %, 36.0 %, and 44.9 %, respectively; the conversion rate of B to A was decreased by 29 %, 33 %, and 37 %; 6 %, 17 %, and 23 %, respectively. The serum potassium was significantly reduced by multiple doses of Fur (20 and 100 mg/kg, bid x 20 d) (P < 0.01). The reduction in serum potassium was positively correlated with the lowering of A/B ratio and the conversion of B to A (P < 0.01).
The inhibition of renal 11beta-HSD activity may be another new biochemical mechanism for hypokalemia induced by Fur.
Halothane and other halogenated anesthetic agents are liquids which are highly soluble in rubber and plastic materials widely used as components of anesthesia machines. These agents must be administered using machines equipped with vaporizers. We report a patient with a past history of halothane hepatitis in whom recurrence was suspected despite the fact that halothane had been avoided purposely during the subsequent operation. Circumstances led us to believe that inapparent circuit contamination of vaporizer-equipped anesthesia machine with halothane may be responsible for the inadvertant rechallenge and recurrence of halothane hepatitis. Vaporizer-equipped machines were tested for inapparent contamination with halothane and enflurane using Perkin-Elmer mass spectrometer. Oxygen alone was passed through the anesthesia circuits, and gas in the efferent limbs of the machines was tested for halothane (in eight machines) and enflurane (in two machines) which were found in various concentrations in all machines so tested. Our findings suggest that inapparent contamination may be widely prevalent in vaporizer-equipped anesthesia machines. The validity of this conclusion was confirmed in five patients with previous diagnosis of halothane hepatitis who subsequently underwent operations under general anesthesia during which machines never equipped with vaporizers were successful in preventing recurrence of hepatitis. We conclude that patients with a prior history of halothane hepatitis are at risk of inapparent circuit contamination-induced recurrent hepatitis. Unless such contamination can be confidently excluded, vaporizer-equipped machines should not be used to administer general anesthesia in these susceptible patients.
A 54-year-old woman with a myelodysplastic syndrome treated with high-dose chemotherapy and an allogenic bone marrow transplant developed acute cortical blindness while receiving tacrolimus (FK506). MRI showed white matter abnormalities. After discontinuation of FK506, the patient's vision returned within 8 days. FK506 neurotoxicity is similar to cyclosporine neurotoxicity and can occur in allogenic bone marrow transplant patients treated with FK506.
A 30-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) went into complete remission following idarubicin and cytarabine chemotherapy; 18 months later she developed repeated skin relapse, with no bone marrow involvement. DNA and RNA analysis of skin lesions revealed the presence of the PML/RAR alpha hybrid gene, which was not detected at the same time in bone marrow. The skin relapses were successfully treated by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) as single agent over 2 years. However, prolonged administration of ATRA caused pseudotumour cerebri, which disappeared upon drug withdrawal. The absence of the hybrid gene in the bone marrow by RT-PCR analysis led to the patient being autografted.
Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), the cofactor of glutamate decarboxylase, paradoxically induces convulsions when injected intracranially in adult mammals. We have tested the effect of some GABAergic and antiglutamatergic drugs on the behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures produced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) microinjection of 1 micromol PLP in the rat. PLP induced barrel turning, running fits and tonic-clonic convulsions, which started 5-10 min after recovery from the anesthesia (halothane), peaked at 20 min and disappeared at about 50 min. These symptoms were accompanied by frequent high amplitude EEG spike burst discharges. Pyridoxal, pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate or deoxypyridoxine were ineffective. The i.c.v. microinjection of the GABAergic compounds muscimol, isoguvacine, aminooxyacetic acid or GABA itself, significantly protected against PLP effects. In contrast, the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and the non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX, failed to protect and induced motor alterations and mortality. We conclude that a temporary decrease of the GABA(A) receptor function is involved in the convulsant effect of PLP. This decrease might be due to the formation of a Schiff base between the carbonyl group of PLP and the epsilon-amino group of a functionally crucial lysine residue located in one extracellular loop of the GABA(A) receptor.
Fatty acid synthase (FASN), the enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis of fatty acids, has been shown to be deregulated in several cancers, including epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). In this study, we investigated the function of the FASN signaling pathway in a large series of Middle Eastern EOC patient samples, a panel of cell lines and nude mouse model. Using immunohistochemistry, we detected overexpression of FASN in 75.5% (114/151) of the tumor samples. Overexpression of FASN was associated significantly with tumor proliferative marker Ki-67 (P = 0.0009), activated AKT (P = 0.0117) and XIAP (P = 0.0046). Treatment of EOC cell lines with C-75, a selective inhibitor of FASN, caused inhibition of EOC cell viability via induction of apoptosis. Inhibition of FASN by C-75 led apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. FASN inhibition caused downregulation of activated AKT and its downstream targets. In addition, inhibition by FASN siRNA caused downregulation of FASN and activation of caspases, suggesting the role of FASN in C-75 mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment of EOC cells with subtoxic doses of C-75 augmented the effect of cisplatin-mediated induction of apoptosis. Finally, treatment of EOC cell line xenografts with a combination of C-75 and cisplatin resulted in growth inhibition of tumors in nude mice through downregulation of FASN and activation of caspases. Altogether, our results show overexpression of FASN in Middle Eastern EOC, suggesting that FASN may be a potential therapeutic target in a subset of EOC, alone or in combination with other conventional chemotherapeutic agents.
Monitoring for adverse effects in an integral part of controlled clinical trials. Traditionally the results of monitoring are reported as either cumulative percentages at the end of the study or cross-sectional percentages at a given time in the study. These results are likely to underestimate the true number of complaints because participants may be withdrawn (e.g., deaths, losses to follow-up, and refusals) before they ever complain of an adverse effect. However, survival analysis methods can be used to compare the distributions of "time to first complaint" in the active and placebo treatment groups, taking into account withdrawals. Participants in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial were monitored for possible adverse effects. On each follow-up visit they were asked whether they had had any of four conditions (blacking out, fatigue, depression, and bronchospasm) since their previous visit about 3 months earlier. The patients were followed for up to 30 months. For fatigue and bronchospasm, the complaint-free time was significantly longer in the placebo vs. active (propranolol) treatment group (P less than 0.005).
This review focuses on the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in elderly patients and offers recommendations for improving outcomes. Nineteen percent of patients with APL are > or =60 years. Rates of response and survival are lower in elderly compared with younger patients, owing to a higher incidence of early deaths or deaths in remission. However, relapse-free survival rates are similar in both groups. Ongoing trials assess the role of reduced-intensity regimens. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and concurrent arsenic trioxide is associated with high rates of response and molecular remission and low rates of induction deaths. We propose this combination as the treatment of choice in patients with APL, including the elderly. Patients with elevated leukocyte counts may also benefit from gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy, with or without leukapheresis. Monitoring major organ function and toxicity is essential. Patients should be assessed for minimal residual disease using polymerase chain reaction testing for promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha. If molecular relapse is evident, treatment with ATRA and idarubicin, with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin, is recommended.
Pregnancy outcome and the effect of pregnancy on cardiac function were assessed in women cured of childhood cancer.
Forty women who received doxorubicin as part of a chemotherapy protocol for a neoplastic disorder in childhood were followed up at the same center during pregnancy and after delivery.
Thirty-seven women (72 pregnancies) completed follow-up. Pregnancy outcome was favorable in the 29 women with fractional shortening values of >or=30% before pregnancy, and their myocardial function was sustained. In 8 women with fractional shortening of <30% before pregnancy, pregnancy outcome was less favorable; a 19% decrease in fractional shortening was observed after pregnancy, and this finding was not significant (P=.08).
Pregnancy outcome in women who received doxorubicin for malignancy in childhood is generally favorable. However, those with baseline left ventricular dysfunction should be considered at increased risk for worse pregnancy outcome and further deterioration in myocardial function.
Antioxidants of the vitamin E family have protective effects against metal toxicity. We examined the protective effect of racemic LLU-alpha [2,7,8-trimethyl-2-(carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman] a metabolite of gamma-tocopherol, in comparison to the effect of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol in rats treated with sodium dichromate (Cr) or thallium sulfate (Tl). We measured metal nephrotoxicity based on urinary protein excretion and discussed it with respect to the metal concentration in renal tissue. The ranking of antioxidant activity (iron stimulated lipid peroxidation, luminol and lucigenin amplified chemiluminescence) was determined in the following order: alpha-tocopherol<gamma-tocopherol<LLU-alpha. Pretreatment with LLU-alpha produced lower chromate nephrotoxicity than alpha- or gamma-tocopherol, but did not influence Cr concentration in renal tissue. The protective effect of LLU-alpha against Cr toxicity seemed to be caused by its stronger antioxidant activity in comparison to alpha- and gamma-tocopherol. Pretreatment with LLU-alpha resulted in lower thallium-induced proteinuria, a lower concentration of Tl in the renal medulla, and higher urinary Tl excretion. Unlike LLU-alpha, which has been shown to inhibit K(+) channels in the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, we found that gamma-tocopherol did not. This finding reaffirmed the similarity between K(+) and Tl(+) and also explained the significantly decreased Tl concentration in the renal medulla in rats treated with LLU-alpha. We speculate that the protective effect of LLU-alpha against Tl nephrotoxicity is caused both by its antioxidant effect and, at least in part, by its ability to decrease Tl concentration as a consequence of inhibited Tl(+) uptake through K(+) channels. This finding confirmed the similarity between K(+) and Tl(+) and also explained the significantly decreased Tl concentration in the renal medulla in rats treated with LLU-alpha.
Although carbamazepine has long been used for the treatment of acute mania, only recently was its efficacy confirmed in a large, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. In the present study, we further evaluated the efficacy and safety of monotherapy with beaded, extended-release carbamazepine capsules (ERC-CBZ) in patients with bipolar I disorder experiencing manic or mixed episodes.
Hospitalized bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV criteria) patients (N = 239) with manic or mixed episodes were randomly assigned on a double-blind basis to receive ERC-CBZ or placebo for 3 weeks, following a single-blind placebo lead-in. Treatment with ERC-CBZ was initiated at 200 mg twice daily, and investigators were encouraged to increase doses, as necessary and tolerated, by 200 mg/day up to 1600 mg/day. Efficacy was assessed weekly with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The study was conducted from July 23, 2002, to April 1, 2003.
144 patients (60.3%) completed the study, with a significant number of placebo patients discontinuing due to lack of efficacy (p < .001). Extended-release carbamazepine treatment was associated with significant improvements in mean YMRS total and CGI total scores, using last-observation-carried-forward analyses, beginning at day 7 (p < .05). Adverse events occurring more frequently in the ERC-CBZ-treated group included dizziness (39.3%), somnolence (30.3%), and nausea (23.8%) [corrected] Patients taking ERC-CBZ experienced a significant increase in total cholesterol, composed of increases in both high-density and low-density lipoproteins.
Extended-release carbamazepine monotherapy had significantly greater efficacy compared with placebo in the treatment of acute mania in this large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
An attempt is made to elucidate the pathogenesis of polyuria arising consequent upon medication of affective states with lithium salts. Experiments conducted with 54 male-rats showed that changes in the neurosecretion of supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis that take place after a course-wise intraperitoneal administration in amounts of 200 mg/kg (2/9DL20) of lithium chloride per 24 hours for a duration of 6 days occur parallel with histochemical changes of renal acid muconpolysaccharides and they accord with the nature of diuresis disorders. By the 5th day of the experiment the compound perverts the antidiuretic effect of a single subcutaneous injection of pituitrin (10 U/kg). The authors infer therefrom that polyuria emerging after introduction of lithium salts is caused by a deranged synthesis and secretion of the diuretic hormone and also by the ability of lithium to mitigate the action of this hormone on the kidneys.
Previous research in our laboratory suggests that serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission mediates the expression of cocaine-induced convulsions. The role of 5-HT in mediating this toxic effect of cocaine appears to be due to activation of 5-HT(2) receptors, because cocaine-induced convulsions are blocked by the 5-HT(2) antagonists cinanserin, ketanserin, and pirenperone. The present study utilized a number of compounds that display a high affinity for 5-HT(2) receptors to further examine the role of these sites in mediating this toxic effect of cocaine. Cocaine-induced convulsions were observed following pretreatment with various doses of the following 5-HT(2) antagonists: mianserin, metergoline, MDL 11939, and methiothepin. In addition, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine (NAN 190) was tested to examine the influence of 5-HT(1) sites and the agonist compound 1-(3-triflurormethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) was examined to further explore the role of 5-HT(1) and 5-HT(2) sites. Each 5-HT(2) antagonist attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions. Conversely, NAN 190 did not alter this toxic effect of cocaine. In addition, TFMPP significantly potentiated cocaine-induced convulsions. The results from this study support the hypothesis that 5-HT neurotransmission, acting primarily at 5-HT(2) receptors, plays an important role in mediating cocaine-induced convulsions.
We report a 16 year-old girl with propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive glomerulonephritis combined with Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
The patient had Graves' disease and had been treated with PTU for about 6 years. She complained of arthralgia, epigastralgia, purpura of the lower extremities, anemia, and abnormal urinalysis. Lupus anticoagulant was positive. Additionally, a high level of anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies (IgG) and a low level of coagulation factor XIII were recognized. She had several complications including lung bleeding, lacuna infarctions of the right frontal and parietal brain lobes, and deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity. We studied tissue histology and carried out MPO-ANCA subtype analysis by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry and MPO-ANCA epitope analysis.
Histologically, purpura showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with perivascular depositions of IgA and complement C3. Renal biopsy showed necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents and mesangial IgA deposits. Notably, IgG, IgM, and IgA ANCA were detected in the patient's serum by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. We diagnosed an overlap syndrome of ANCA-positive vasculitis, HSPN, and APS. A change in the reactivity of MPO-ANCA from recognition of only the Hg epitope in the C-terminal region to recognition of multiple MPO epitopes was accompanied by a remission of symptoms.
This report may provide a very rare description of an overlap syndrome of PTU-induced ANCA vasculitis, HSPN, and APS in which not only IgG ANCA but also IgA and IgM ANCA were found. Epitope analysis may be a useful marker for disease-monitoring of PTU-induced ANCA-positive vasculitis. This case may provide insight into the pathological mechanism underlying each of these diseases.
Dipyrone injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) or subplantarly into the mouse paw caused dose-related antinociception against the early and the late phases of formalin-induced licking, with mean ID50 values of 154.5 and 263.7 micromol/kg, and 2.6 and 1.2 micromol/paw, respectively. Given either by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or by intrathecal (i.t.) routes, dipyrone produced a similar inhibition of both phases of the formalin-induced licking, with mean ID50 values of 0.4 and 1.3 micromol/site, and 0.4 and 0.9 micromol/site against the early and the late phase of the formalin response, respectively. Dipyrone, given by i.p., subplantar, i.t. or i.c.v. routes, caused dose-related antinociception of capsaicin-induced licking. The mean ID50 values were: 207.6 micromol/kg, 2.2 micromol/paw, 0.4 micromol/site and 0.14 micromol/site, respectively. In addition, dipyrone given i.p. caused a significant increase of the latency both in the hot-plate and the tail-flick assays. Dipyrone, given i.p., i.t. or i.c.v., reversed significantly the hyperalgesia caused by i.t. injection of glutamate, with mean ID50 values of 9 micromol/kg, 29 nmol/site and 94 nmol/site, respectively. The antinociception caused by dipyrone was not influenced by naloxone, L-arginine, phaclofen, glibenclamide, p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester, pertussis toxin or by adrenal gland hormones, when assessed against the formalin assay. Dipyrone analgesic action was not secondary to its anti-inflammatory effect, nor was it associated with non-specific effects such as muscle relaxation or sedation actions of animals. Dipyrone at a higher concentration caused significant inhibition of [3H]glutamate binding (37%) in cerebral cortical membranes from both mice and rats. However, dipyrone had no significant effect on brain constitutive neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity. It is concluded that dipyrone produces peripheral, spinal and supraspinal antinociception when assessed on formalin and capsaicin-induced pain as well as in glutamate-induced hyperalgesia in mice. Dipyrone antinociception seems unlikely to involve an interaction with the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway, serotonin system, activation of Gi protein sensitive to pertussis toxin. interaction of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, GABA(B) receptors, or the release of endogenous glucocorticoids. However, a modulatory effect on glutamate-induced hyperalgesia and, to a lesser extent, an interaction with glutamate binding sites, seems to account for its analgesic action.
A randomized, double-blind study of procaine/haematoporphyrin (KH3) has been carried out over two years in a selected population of healthy elderly subjects. The period of study exceeds 500 patient years. The trial population was weighted to contain a larger proportion of subjects aged over 75 years than a standard population; those receiving active KH3 had similar characteristics on entry to those receiving placebo. Over the course of two years, KH3 was shown to be an active substance in that: (a) decrement in the consolidation of new learning was prevented in the treatment group (less than 1.0%, as against 38% in the placebo group); (b) the prevalence of incontinence increased significantly in the placebo group, but not in the active group (P less than 0.05); (c) there was a significant increase in grip strength in the active treatment group (+22%, P less than 0.01 v. placebo); (d) more adverse reactions were observed on treatment with KH3 (P less than 0.005).
A case is presented of psoriasis occurring de novo during lithium therapy and progressing to psoriatic arthritis. Exacerbation of pre-existing psoriasis during lithium treatment has often been described, as has the disease occurring de novo. This would seem to be the first description of psoriatic arthritis apparently related to lithium.
A study was made of the "rundown" of GABA(A) receptors, microtransplanted to Xenopus oocytes from surgically resected brain tissues of patients afflicted with drug-resistant human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Cell membranes, isolated from mTLE neocortex specimens, were injected into frog oocytes that rapidly incorporated functional GABA(A) receptors. Upon repetitive activation with GABA (1 mM), "epileptic" GABA(A) receptors exhibited a GABA(A)-current (I(GABA)) rundown that was significantly enhanced by Zn(2+) (</=250 microM), and practically abolished by the high-affinity GABA(A) receptor inverse agonist SR95531 (gabazine; 2.5-25 microM). Conversely, I(GABA) generated by "control" GABA(A) receptors microtransplanted from nonepileptic temporal lobe, lesional TLE, or authoptic disease-free tissues remained stable during repetitive stimulation, even in oocytes treated with Zn(2+). We conclude that rundown of mTLE epileptic receptors depends on the presence of "phasic GABA(A) receptors" that have low sensitivity to antagonism by Zn(2+). Additionally, we found that GABA(A) receptors, microtransplanted from the cerebral cortex of adult rats exhibiting recurrent seizures, caused by pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, showed greater rundown than control tissue, an event also occurring in patch-clamped rat pyramidal neurons. Rundown of epileptic rat receptors resembled that of human mTLE receptors, being enhanced by Zn(2+) (40 microM) and sensitive to the antiepileptic agent levetiracetam, the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the phosphatase blocker okadaic acid. Our findings point to the rundown of GABA(A) receptors as a hallmark of TLE and suggest that modulating tonic and phasic mTLE GABA(A) receptor activity may represent a useful therapeutic approach to the disease.
Some cases of Alzheimer's disease are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Genetic linkage studies have mapped a locus (AD3) associated with susceptibility to a very aggressive form of Alzheimer's disease to chromosome 14q24.3. We have defined a minimal cosegregating region containing the AD3 gene, and isolated at least 19 different transcripts encoded within this region. One of these transcripts (S182) corresponds to a novel gene whose product is predicted to contain multiple transmembrane domains and resembles an integral membrane protein. Five different missense mutations have been found that cosegregate with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Because these changes occurred in conserved domains of this gene, and are not present in normal controls, they are likely to be causative of AD3.
Linezolid is a recent oral antibiotic used in drug-resistant Gram-positive cocci infections. Herein, we report on the first case of linezolid-related acute renal failure in a kidney-transplant patient. A 60-year-old male having autosomic polycystic kidney disease with liver involvement, on cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil and very low dose prednisolone, presented with an Enterococcus faecium abscess of a huge liver cyst, which was treated by percutaneous drainage and linezolid therapy. Eight days after starting linezolid, he presented with acute renal failure, i.e. serum creatinine increased from 136- 221 micromol/l, associated with mild hypereosinophilia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. There was no skin rash, arthralgia, eosinophiluria or proteinuria. The transplant kidney biopsy, performed 15 days after the beginning of linezolid therapy, showed interstitial nephritis and focal tubular atrophy. After linezolid withdrawal and increasing prednisolone daily dose to 20 mg/d, within a few days, serum creatinine had decreased; after 2 and 4 weeks post linezolid withdrawal, his serum creatinine was 166 and 159 micromol/l, respectively. Because of the potential side effects of linezolid, i.e. myelosuppression and possibly nephrotoxicity, we recommend close monitoring of these parameters when linezolid therapy is attempted in kidney transplant patients.
To determine the safety for both mother and fetus of antimalarial drugs, i.e., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, in pregnant patients with lupus who continued antimalarial drugs throughout pregnancy. Stopping antimalarial drugs can precipitate disease flares of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which are known to be detrimental to the outcome of pregnancy in patients with SLE. Stopping antimalarial drugs during pregnancy therefore not only puts the mother's health at risk but can also compromise the outcome of pregnancy.
We document 9 pregnancies in 8 patients with lupus, all of whom took hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) throughout pregnancy. All 9 pregnancies, which occurred since our first report in 1988, resulted in 9 live births (4 full term and 5 preterm).
No congenital abnormalities occurred and mean followup of 33 months (range 10-72 months) revealed no abnormalities in these children. Temporary discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine for 1 month precipitated a flare of disease in one mother, documented both clinically and serologically.
It is safer to continue hydroxychloroquine rather than to discontinue this drug simply because of pregnancy.
To evaluate whether Mallory bodies (MBs) are linked to the induction of the enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), mice were fed 2.5% griseofulvin (GF). The experimental and control mice livers were examined at four time periods, i.e., after 4 months' of GF feeding, 1 month after GF withdrawal and 13 days after GF refeeding, and at sacrifice after 4 months of GF withdrawal. The livers from mice continuously fed GF or control diet for 10 months were also examined. Tumors and nontumorous livers were examined histologically, histochemically, electron microscopically, and immunocytochemically. The tumors consisted of hepatomas and hyperplastic nodules. To localize MBs inside GGT-positive cells, a double-staining method was employed; GGT-positive cells were identified histochemically followed by staining for MBs using the unlabeled immunoperoxidase technique. The per cent area of the GGT-positive foci was closely correlated with the frequency of MBs observed in the course of a GF feeding and withdrawal. Almost all of the MBs were located in GGT-positive cells in both tumors and nontumor liver tissue. MBs and GGT positivity involved the same liver cells. They both were found in high frequency in tumors induced by GF. These results indicate that MB formation, like GGT induction, is a phenotypic change induced by GF. The coexistence of the two phenomenon in the same cell throughout all phases of tumor formation suggests that MBs may be related to the neoplastic process in the GF-fed mouse model.
Vanadium is an important regulator of cellular growth, differentiation, and cell death, and thus has received increasing attention to be an effective cancer chemopreventive agent. In the present study, attempts have been made to investigate the in vivo antineoplastic effect of this micronutrient at the 0.5 ppm dosage in drinking water, by monitoring hepatic nodulogenesis and hepatocellular phenotype followed by antioxidant status and atomic absorption spectrometric estimation of some essential biometals during the multistage of carcinogenesis induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF; 0.05% in basal diet). Finally, sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) and DNA-protein crosslink (DPC) formation, as potential biomarkers were estimated to find out the suppressive effect of vanadium at the molecular level. The results showed that vanadium administration throughout the experiment reduced the relative liver weight, nodular incidence (48.40%), total number, and multiplicity (63.91%), and altered the size of visible persistent nodules (PNs) with concurrent restoration of hepatic glutathione (P < 0.01), glutathione-S-transferase (P < 0.001) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (P < 0.001) activities as well as, hepatic zinc and copper contents (P < 0.001) when compared to the carcinogen control. Moreover, vanadium treatment significantly reduced SCE frequency (50.24%) and DPC coefficient (P < 0.001; 21.30%). Our results, thus, strongly suggest that supplementary vanadium at a dose of 0.5 ppm, when administered continuously throughout the study, than administered either in the initiation or promotion phase alone, is very much effective in suppressing neoplastic transformation during 2-AAF-induced in vivo rat hepatocarcinogenesis.
A case is reported in which a previously patent artery became temporarily occluded during angiography. The authors believe it happened because of incompatibility of the contrast agent ioxaglate (Hexabrix) and papaverine. Extreme caution is recommended whenever a new low-osmolality contrast agent is used in conjunction with a pharmacoangiographic agent.
