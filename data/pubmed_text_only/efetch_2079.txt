Persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants can result in serious hemodynamic changes causing respiratory, gastrointestinal and renal morbidities if not treated within the first week of life. The treatment options available are a conservative approach, pharmacological treatment with cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors and surgical ligation. The COX inhibitors approved for use in the United States are indomethacin and ibuprofen lysine. Both of these drugs are equally effective in closing the PDA. Subtle differences exist between these two preparations. Indomethacin has a protective effect on the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) but reduces the blood flow to the kidneys and the brain. Ibuprofen is less toxic but has no effect on IVH. Efficacy of pharmacological treatment is influenced by timing of initiation of therapy. Surgical treatment is the only option when pharmacological treatment fails to close the PDA in symptomatic infants. Long-term neurological and respiratory morbidities are associated with surgical ligation. This paper reviews these medical considerations in the treatment options for PDA in premature infants.
Renal failure has been viewed as a state of cellular calcium toxicity due to the retention of small fast-acting molecules. We have tested this hypothesis and identified potentially neuroexcitatory compounds among a number of putative uremic neurotoxins by examining the acute in vitro effects of these compounds on cultured central neurons. The in vitro neuroexcitatory and synergistic effects of guanidinosuccinate and spermine were also examined in vivo.
The acute effects of 17 candidate uremic neurotoxins on murine spinal cord neurons in primary dissociated cell culture were investigated using the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. The compounds studied comprised low-molecular-weight solutes like urea, indoles, guanidino compounds, polyamines, purines and phenoles, homocysteine, orotate, and myoinositol. Currents evoked by these compounds were further examined using various ligand- and voltage-gated ion channel blockers. The acute in vivo effects of guanidinosuccinate and spermine were behaviorally assessed following their injection in mice.
It was shown that 3-indoxyl sulfate, guanidinosuccinate, spermine, and phenol evoked significant whole-cell currents. Inward whole-cell current evoked by 3-indoxyl sulfate was not blocked by any of the applied ligand- or voltage-gated ion channel blockers, and the compound appeared to influence miscellaneous membrane ionic conductances, probably involving voltage-gated Ca2+ channels as well. Phenol-evoked outward whole-cell currents were at least partly due to the activation of voltage-gated K+ channels, but may also involve a variety of other ionic conductances. On the other hand, inward whole-cell currents evoked by guanidinosuccinate and spermine were shown to be due to specific interaction with voltage- and ligand-gated Ca2+ channels. Guanidinosuccinate-evoked current was caused by activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-associated ion channels. Low (micromol/L) concentrations of spermine potentiated guanidinosuccinate-evoked current through the action of spermine on the polyamine binding site of the NMDA receptor complex, whereas current evoked by high (mmol/L) concentrations of spermine alone involved direct activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Finally, intracerebroventricular administration of 0.25 micromol/L spermine potentiated clonic convulsions induced by guanidinosuccinate. These neuroexcitatory and synergistic effects of guanidinosuccinate and spermine could take place at pathophysiologic concentrations.
The observed in vitro and in vivo effects of uremic retention solutes suggest that the identified compounds could play a significant role in uremic pathophysiology. Some of the compounds tested displayed in vitro and in vivo neuroexcitatory effects that were mediated by ligand- and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The findings suggest a mechanism for the involvement of calcium toxicity in the central nervous system complications in renal failure with particular reference to guanidinosuccinate and spermine.
Wistar rats were treated with gentamicin in single (80 mg/kg) or repeated doses (7 x 40 mg/kg) subcutaneously. Total protein as well as excretion of essential metals (Cu, Zn) with the urine were determined 24 hr after 1, 3 and 7 dosages as well as 3 and 7 days after the termination of administration. At the same time kidneys were examined histopathologically by light microscopy. Simultaneously, Cu, Zn and metallothionein levels in kidneys and liver were determined. Rats receiving gentamicin demonstrated progressive renal proximal tubular necrosis at the end of 7 days administration. At the same time elevated copper and zinc levels were observed in urine. These essential metals seem to be an indicator of gentamicin nephrotoxicity.
Although renal function is generally unaffected by liposome formulations of amphotericin B-deoxycholate, there is nevertheless a risk.
Two patients immunodepressed patients treated for candidosis involving the mouth and esophagus unresponsive to local care and flucanazol developed renal failure when given the liposome formulation of amphotericin B-deoxycholate (AmBisome). In one with normal renal function prior to treatment, moderate impairment was observed after initiating AmBisome. In the second patient, impaired renal function worsened after initiating treatment with amphotericin B-deoxycholate then progressed to very severe renal failure after switching to AmBisome.
The indication for AmBisome (amphotericin B-deoxycholate treatment in patients with active renal impairment) must not overshadow the risk of worsening renal function under treatment.
To report QTc interval prolongation associated with combination therapy including levofloxacin, imipramine, and fluoxetine.
A 49-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with fever, aches, and pains for the past 3 days. She was diagnosed and treated for pyelonephritis in the hospital. Therapy included intravenous levofloxacin 500 mg every 24 hours and ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours, along with her medications upon admission, including imipramine 50 mg at bedtime and fluoxetine 10 mg/day. She was discharged after 5 days and returned the next day with chest tightness and shortness of breath. Upon the second admission, a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed a QTc interval of 509 msec. Levofloxacin was discontinued and the QTc interval fell to 403 msec. The patient was discharged 3 days later and instructed to consult with her primary care physician about discontinuing imipramine.
This adverse drug reaction is thought to be a pharmacodynamic additive effect among fluoxetine, imipramine, and levofloxacin. Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, and imipramine is metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore, fluoxetine is able to increase the plasma concentrations of imipramine, leading to QT interval prolongation. Taken with imipramine, levofloxacin can lead to even greater prolongation of the QT interval. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, levofloxacin was possibly associated with cardiac arrhythmias in our patient.
The use of levofloxacin alone, or more often in concomitant therapy with other medications that are known to prolong the QT interval, may cause QT interval prolongation; however, additional studies/case reports are needed to validate this conclusion.
The relative cardiotoxicity of pegylated (STEALTH) liposomal doxorubicin (PL-DOX; Doxil) was compared to nonliposomal doxorubicin (Adriamycin) in rabbits and dogs treated i.v. for up to 22 weeks. No histological evidence of cardiotoxicity was seen in dogs treated with placebo liposomes or PL-DOX every 3 weeks for a total of 10 doses (cumulative doxorubicin dose = 10 mg/kg) either 1 or 5 weeks post-treatment. All dogs treated with the same cumulative dose of free doxorubicin showed marked cardiotoxicity (vacuolization and myofibrillar loss in the myocardium) at both time points. In rabbits, progressive cardiomyopathy was seen in both treatment groups, but was more frequent and severe with free doxorubicin (67% of doxorubicin-treated rabbits, cumulative dose = 12 to 14 mg/kg versus 16% of PL-DOX-treated animals, cumulative dose = 14 to 21 mg/kg). Five doxorubicin-treated rabbits died of congestive heart failure or with histologic evidence of cardiotoxicity (median severity score = 6). No PL-DOX-treated rabbits died of congestive heart failure, although two animals that died early showed microscopic evidence of mild cardiotoxicity (median severity score = 2.5). Cardiotoxicity increased during the post-treatment period in both treatment groups. Rabbits received up to 50% more PL-DOX with no increase in cardiotoxicity. Thus, results in two species demonstrate that the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is significantly decreased when administered as PL-DOX. Significantly more PL-DOX can be given without incurring an increased risk of cardiomyopathy. Recent clinical studies have confirmed that PL-DOX is also less cardiotoxic than the same dose of unencapsulated doxorubicin in humans.
The underlying mechanisms of the ketogenic diet (KD) remain unknown. Involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) has been suggested. The aim of this study was to assess the anticonvulsant properties of fenofibrate, a PPARalpha agonist. Wistar rats were fed at libitum during 14 days by regular diet, KD, regular diet containing 0.2% fenofibrate (F), or KD containing 0.2% fenofibrate (KD + F). Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) threshold and latencies to the onset of status epilepticus induced by lithium-pilocarpine were used to assess diet treatments with anticonvulsive effects. Myoclonic and generalized seizure PTZ thresholds were increased in F- and KD-treated animals in comparison to control. No difference was observed between KD + F group and the others groups (control, F, KD). Latencies to the onset of status epilepticus were increased in F and KD groups compared to control. Fenofibrate exerts anticonvulsive properties comparable to KD in adult rats using PTZ and lithium-pilocarpine models. The underlying mechanisms such as PPARalpha activation and others should be investigated. These findings may provide insights into future directions to simplify KD protocols.
Various strategies have been proposed to reduce discomfort of pain after rocuronium injection. These studies have shown pretreatment of drugs such as fentanyl and lidocaine to be effective. In a prospective randomized study, we evaluated whether pretreatment with local warming at injection site using an air-warming device could effectively alleviate pain induced by rocuronium.
Ninety patients undergoing spinal surgeries were randomly divided into two groups: group C (control) and group T (treatment). Patients in group T were subjected to warming at 40°C for 1 min prior to injecting 1 ml (10 mg) of rocuronium at the site of venous access. Patients were then assessed for any discomfort and to quantify their discomfort on a 5-point scale.
Age, sex, and weight were comparable between the two groups. Pain on rocuronium administration was reported by 88.9% patient in group C versus 66.7% in group T (p < 0.05). Severe pain was significantly less in group T (35.6% vs. 8.9%).
Application of warmth over the vascular access prior to rocuronium administration effectively reduces injection-related pain.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is often associated with a severe hemostatic disorder, caused by the release of procoagulant and fibrinolytic substances from leukemic blasts. The coagulation profile may exhibit disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis or proteolysis. Therefore, heparin and antifibrinolytic agents alone or in combination have been used to prevent severe bleedings. Remission induction with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is accompanied with rapid correction of hemostatic abnormalities. Thrombosis is a rare complication of APL and may be due to the alterations in hemostasis caused by the disease itself as well as ATRA and antifibrinolytics. Here, the occurrence of thrombosis during induction treatment with ATRA combined with aprotinin and chemotherapy is described in a patient who is homozygous for factor VQ 506 mutation.
Chorea is a rare side effect of anticonvulsants. We describe three patients who developed chorea secondary to anticonvulsant combination use. A mechanism to explain this finding is proposed. After identification of an index case with anticonvulsant-induced chorea, we reviewed the electronic data base records for all patients with seizures followed in the epilepsy clinics at our university-based hospital for cases of dyskinesia associated with anticonvulsants. Two additional patients, one adult and one pediatric patient were identified. Three patients developed chorea while receiving combination anticonvulsants. Two patients had transient chorea that resolved with withdrawal of one of the drugs. All three patients were using phenytoin and lamotrigine in combination when the chorea started, chorea improved with tapering one of the medications. Polytherapy with certain anticonvulsants may predispose patients to drug-induced chorea. A particular increased risk was seen with combinations that have phenytoin and lamotrigine. This could be due to an additive or a synergistic effect on central dopaminergic pathways.
Xenon provides effective analgesia in several pain states at sub-anaesthetic doses. Our aim was to examine whether xenon may mediate its analgesic effect, in part, through reducing the activity of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), a receptor known to be involved in certain inflammatory pain conditions.
We studied the effect of xenon on capsaicin-evoked cobalt uptake in rat cultured primary sensory neurons and in human TRPV1 (hTRPV1)-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. We also examined xenon's effect on the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the rat spinal dorsal horn evoked by hind-paw injection of capsaicin.
Xenon (75%) reduced the number of primary sensory neurons responding to the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin (100 nM-1 μM) by ~25% to ~50%. Xenon reduced the number of heterologously-expressed hTRPV1 activated by 300 nM capsaicin by ~50%. Xenon (80%) reduced by ~40% the number of phosphorylated ERK1/2-expressing neurons in rat spinal dorsal horn resulting from hind-paw capsaicin injection.
Xenon substantially reduces the activity of TRPV1 in response to noxious stimulation by the specific TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin, suggesting a possible role for xenon as an adjunct analgesic where hTRPV1 is an active contributor to the excitation of primary afferents which initiates the pain sensation.
Optimal antihypertensive therapy should control blood pressure at rest and during stress while preserving the physiologic hemodynamic response. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, the hemodynamic profile and catecholamine response at rest, during isometric, mental, and orthostatic stresses were compared before and 12 weeks after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or calcium channel blockade. Antihypertensive therapy was titrated either with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor fosinopril (10 to 40 mg; n = 9) or with the calcium antagonist isradipine (5 to 20 mg; n = 10) until diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg was achieved. Groups were comparable in race, sex, body mass index, pretreatment mean arterial pressure and response to isometric stress (25% increase in mean arterial pressure) before treatment. At rest, total peripheral resistance was reduced to the same extent (18%) in both groups. After fosinopril, the percent increase in stroke volume was higher and heart rate lower than with isradipine. During isometric stress, the percent increase in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output was higher, with isradipine (p < 0.05) reaching pretreatment levels. Plasma catecholamines were also higher with isradipine (p < 0.05), increasing by 100% with plasma norepinephrine compared with 16% before treatment. During orthostatic stress significant reductions in mean arterial pressure and stroke volume were observed after isradipine but not after fosinopril. Neither medication significantly modified the response to mental stress. Our data suggest that despite a comparable reduction in total peripheral resistance at rest, fosinopril preserves a more physiologic hemodynamic response to isometric and orthostatic stress than isradipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
DHA-Ascorbic acid (DHA-As), a new derivative of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was tested for its possible antiarrhythmic effects on coronary artery ligation/reperfusion arrhythmias in rat hearts, and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias in canine hearts. DHA-As (3 mg/kg i.v.) did not change the total duration of VT, and tended to suppress the incidence of VT, VF and mortality of reperfusion in rat hearts. The heart rate, QT90 and systolic blood pressure did not change, and the diastolic blood pressure was decreased by DHA-As in the rat hearts. DHA-As significantly decreased the arrhythmic ratio only at two time points (14 and 15 min after injection), and also decreased the heart rate and mean blood pressure in canine hearts. In conclusion, DHA-As tended to suppress the reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in rat hearts. However, the change was not statistically significant. In addition, DHA-As has a weak suppressing effect on adrenaline-induced arrhythmia.
We compared the effectiveness and incidence of nephrotoxicity of ampicillin-tobramycin and cefotaxime in 73 cirrhotics who had severe bacterial infection. Most of these patients had spontaneous peritonitis and/or bacteremia. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Group I included 36 patients treated with ampicillin-tobramycin and Group II comprised 37 patients treated with cefotaxime. Patients from both groups were similar with respect to clinical data, standard liver and renal function tests, types of infection and isolated organisms. Ninety-two per cent of bacteria isolated in Group I and 98% of those isolated in Group II were susceptible in vitro to ampicillin-tobramycin and to cefotaxime, respectively. Ampicillin-tobramycin cured the infection in 56% of Group I patients, and cefotaxime in 85% of Group II patients (p less than 0.02). Five patients treated with ampicillin-tobramycin, and none treated with cefotaxime developed superinfections (p = 0.024). Nephrotoxicity (impairment of renal function associated with an increase of urinary beta 2-microglobulin to over 2,000 micrograms per liter) occurred in two patients in Group I and none in Group II. These results suggest that broad-spectrum cephalosporins should be considered as first choice antibiotics in cirrhotic patients with severe infections.
Basophils in mononuclear cell populations were challenged with allergens, anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE), C5a or formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), with or without a short pre-incubation with interleukin-3 (IL-3), in the presence of increasing concentrations of terfenadine. At doses of 0.1-1 micrograms/ml, terfenadine inhibits histamine release and generation of the sulfidoleukotrienes, leukotriene C4, D4 and E4 in basophils challenged with an IgE-dependent trigger. At concentrations above 10 micrograms/ml, however, terfenadine induces the histamine release but abolishes the formation of leukotrienes, and this may be due to a cytotoxic effect. In eosinophils, by contrast, terfenadine appears to inhibit the production of leukotrienes by eosinophils, triggered by FMLP only at concentrations above 10 micrograms/ml (which are toxic to basophils at least). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 15 allergic patients were given skin challenges with specific allergen and with histamine, before and at 3 days, 2 and 4 weeks after treatment with terfenadine (120 mg/day for 3 days). The skin reactions were evaluated visually and followed kinetically by thermography. Terfenadine caused a significant decrease in both the immediate and late-phase reactions. Late-phase reactions to histamine were shown with thermography in some of the patients tested.
Losartan (COZAAR) is the prototype of a new class of potent and selective angiotensin II (AII) type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists with the largest published preclinical and clinical data base. Since all of the AII antagonists are selective for the AT(1) receptor, these drugs should exhibit similar cardiovascular effects. However, since the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents and their degree of affinity for the AT(1) receptor differ, it is likely that differences in clinical profiles between these drugs exist and will require investigation. Losartan (parent compound), has moderate affinity for the AT(1) receptor (competitive inhibition). Losartan is well-absorbed orally as an active drug and is rapidly converted via oxidation in the human liver to a more potent metabolite (designated E3174) with an affinity 20- to 30-times greater for the AT(1) receptor (non-competitive inhibition). E3174 has a half-life of 6 - 9 h; elimination is via renal and hepatic routes. Antihypertensive and, in heart failure patients, haemodynamic activity is observed over a 24 h period with once daily dosing. Over 6 million patients have been treated for hypertension with continued excellent tolerability. Clinical experience in heart failure is growing, and recent data suggest an improved survival with losartan versus captopril, a drug from the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor class with proven benefit in this population. The current comprehensive losartan clinical end-point programme (4 large scale morbidity/mortality trials) should provide evidence regarding the efficacy of direct blockade of the AT(1) receptor with losartan compared to standard therapy: 1) The Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study - ELITE II, 2) The Losartan Post-Myocardial Infarction Survival Study - OPTIMAAL, 3) The Losartan Hypertension Survival Study - LIFE and 4) The Losartan Renal Protection Study - RENAAL.
Three patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas initially were seen because of optic neuropathy caused by a toxic reaction to chloramphenicol. The ocular symptoms were characterized by loss of visual acuity, central scotomas, red-green dyschromatopsia, and fundus changes. An increase in the latency of the occipital evoked potentials paralleled the visual impairment. A transient photopic decline in the red-light-elicited electroretinogram and the occurrence of Uhthoff's sign in the acute stage of the disease were observed. All visual impairment recovered partially or totally after the withdrawal of therapy with the drug.
Eight patients with meningeal seeding by carcinoma or lymphomas were treated with intravenous (i.v.) and/or intrathecal (i.th.) Methotrexate (MTX). Seven patients received additional craniospinal irradiation and in all seven a fatal encephalopathy developed. On the bases of clinical and morphological findings we identified an acute and a delayed form of encephalopathy and concluded that the concurrent administration of Methotrexate and of craniospinal irradiation increases considerably the risk of brain damage.
The in vivo action of the antimicrobial peptide melittin, expressed from a recombinant plasmid vector, on chickens experimentally infected with Mycoplasma gallisepticum was studied. The plasmid vector pBI/mel2/rtTA includes the melittin gene under the control of an inducible tetracycline-dependent human cytomegalovirus promoter and the gene coding for the trans-activation protein rtTA. Aerosol administration of the vector, followed by infecting the chickens with M. gallisepticum 1226, is shown to inhibit development of infection. The inhibitory action was confirmed by a complex of clinical, pathomorphological, histological and serological studies, and also by comparing the M. gallisepticum reisolation frequency from the respiratory tract and internal organs. The data suggest that plasmid vectors expressing genes of antimicrobial peptides can be considered as potential agents for the prevention and treatment of mycoplasma infections in poultry farming.
This study was designed to investigate and compare the haemodynamic and metabolic responses to pirbuterol and salbutamol in patients with congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. Attention was directed towards the effects these beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists have on left ventricular systolic function, systemic and coronary haemodynamics and myocardial substrate metabolism. Sixteen patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either pirbuterol 20 mg or salbutamol 6 mg. Since no statistically significant differences between the responses to these drugs were observed, combined data for both agents are presented. Ninety minutes after the drug intervention cardiac index increased from 2.2 +/- 0.1 to 2.9 +/- 0.2 1/min per m2 (P less than 0.001) in association with marked reductions in systemic vascular resistance (from 22 +/- 1 to 15 +/- 1 units, P less than 0.001) and increments in left ventricular dp/dtmax (from 1074 +/- 85 to 1422 +/- 133 mm Hg/sec, P less than 0.05). Modest reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 21 +/- 1 to 15 +/- 1 mm Hg, P less than 0.01) were observed. Heart rate increased from 82 +/- 5 to 91 +/- 4 beats/min (P less than 0.01) but the small fall in mean arterial pressure (from 86 +/- 3 to 78 +/- 3 mm Hg) was not significant. Drug-induced coronary vasodilatation reduced coronary coronary vascular resistance from 0.65 +/- 0.06 to 0.47 +/- 0.04 units (P less than 0.01) and led to a marked increase in coronary sinus blood flow (from 124 +/- 9 to 155 +/- 9 ml/min, P less than 0.05). Arterial levels of free fatty acids increased from 0.78 +/- 0.13 to 1.05 +/- 0.18 mmol/l (P less than 0.05) resulting in the preferential utilization of this substrate as a myocardial energy source. Despite the substantial haemodynamic improvement, however, no significant increase in myocardial oxygen uptake or lactate production was observed. Thus, in patients with coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure pirbuterol and salbutamol improve left ventricular function by a combination of afterload reduction and positive inotropism such that no appreciable deterioration in myocardial energetics occurs.
The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there are geographic differences in the etiology of parkinsonism (PA).
72% of patients with PA evaluated at movement disorders clinics in the Northern Hemisphere are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). Data regarding other regions are not available.
We reviewed the charts of all patients with PA seen at the Federal University of Minas Gerais Movement Disorders Clinic from July 1993 through October 1995. PA was diagnosed by the presence of at least two of the following: rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. The different etiologies were diagnosed based on standard clinical criteria.
During the period of the study, PA was recognized in 338 subjects. The following clinical diagnoses were made: PD (68.9%), drug-induced PA (DIP) (13.3%), vascular PA (4.7%), Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (2%), multiple system atrophy (MSA) (1.8%), others (9.7%). Cinnarizine, haloperidol and flunarizine were the commonest drugs related to DIP.
Similarly to other studies, PD accounts for about 70% of PA patients. However, there are differences between our results and previous series. DIP is much more common in the present series. This may be accounted for a more liberal use of antidopaminergic drugs in our environment, especially Calcium channel blockers. The lower frequency of MSA and PSP in our study may reflect a short follow-up, since many patients initially diagnosed with PD later are found to have Parkinson-plus syndromes.
Flecainide was given to a patient in a dose of 150 mg twice daily to convert a newly developed atrial fibrillation; concomitant therapy was unchanged. After the fourth dose the patient complained of upper abdominal pain and nausea. GOT and GPT, normal at admission to the hospital, became markedly elevated and reached a maximum of 960 IU/I (GOT) and 993 IU/I (GPT) one day later, although the enzymes which indicate cholestasis remained at a normal level or did not increase. On the assumption of a drug-induced allergic reaction, flecainide was withdrawn, after which liver enzymes rapidly returned to control values. Although neither a reexposition with flecainide nor a liver biopsy was obtained, a flecainide-induced hepatitis seems probable.
A case of acute dystonia related to rivastigmine use is reported.
A 61-year-old Caucasian woman who had suffered from bipolar II disorder with rapid cycling for over 30 years was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit. In addition to bipolar II disorder, the patient had been previously diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, and various anxiety disorders. During the current hospitalization, she was taking clonazepam, dextroamphetamine, lamotrigine, lansoprazole, levothyroxine, memantine, quetiapine, risperidone, rivastigmine, tranylcypromine, trazodone, and zolpidem. Soon after hospital admission, she began to complain of a tightening in her chest. A review of her records revealed similar complaints during previous hospitalizations. Rivastigmine was discontinued due to concerns of interactions with her antipsychotic regimen. Although these symptoms were previously attributed to anxiety, they appeared worse during this hospitalization. During these events she would be witnessed lying in bed in a supine position with her head canted posteriorly. Benztropine was given to help determine if she was having a dystonic reaction. Within 30 minutes, her chest discomfort began to resolve, and her symptoms resolved completely over the next 48 hours. Three days later, rivastigmine was restarted by the attending psychiatrist because of concerns about the patient's memory, and the dystonia-like symptoms returned within 2 hours of her morning dose. Rivastigmine was discontinued, and benztropine was given and then discontinued, with no return of symptoms for the remainder of her two-week hospitalization.
A patient with bipolar II disorder and mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease developed dystonia, possibly caused by rivastigmine. However, the patient was taking various other medications that could have lowered the threshold for extrapyramidal syndromes.
The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and their combined use with an antiestrogenic steroid on erythropoiesis were investigated in patients on chronic hemodialysis (CHD). Hematocrit was decreased by 10% or more in 6 of 12 patients who received either captopril or enalapril for 2-6 months. Erythropoietin (Epo) and angiotensin II (AII) were significantly reduced in these patients. When treatment with mepitiostane was combined with ACE inhibitor, anemia was significantly improved but without evidence of changes in circulating Epo concentrations or indices of renin-angiotensin activity. The reduction of AII and Epo formation by ACE inhibitors seems to play an important role in the worsening of anemia in patients on CHD; addition of an antiestrogenic steroid should be considered.
Small electrolyte additions to a nonionic contrast medium reduce the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during wedged catheter injection of a contrast medium. The current study was designed to further investigate contrast-medium-induced VF by studying the effect of pretreatment with different antiarrhythmic drugs.
During a simulated wedged catheter situation, iohexol was injected into the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery in five open-chest, anesthetized dogs pretreated with lidocaine, propranolol, amiodarone, almokalant, or verapamil.
Wedging the catheter for 60 sec did not induce VF. However, all 15 wedged catheter injections with iohexol induced VF within 28 sec (19 +/- 1 [mean +/- standard error of the mean]) despite pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs. Prior to VF, conduction was slowed and monophasic action potential duration lengthened in the contrast-medium-perfused myocardium, although no significant changes occurred in the control area.
The combination of catheter wedging and long-lasting contrast medium injection has a high risk of causing VF. Although adding a small amount of electrolytes to nonionic contrast media can reduce the risk of VF, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may not have a protective effect.
We have previously demonstrated antileishmanial activity on Leishmania amazonensis of the natural (1-2), synthetic (7) and derivatives of coumarin (-) mammea A/BB (3-6) isolated from the dichloromethane extract of Calophyllum brasiliense leaves. The aim of the present study was to evaluate morphological and ultrastructural alterations in Leishmania amazonensis induced by these compounds. In promastigote forms, all seven compounds produced significant morphological and ultrastructural alterations, as revealed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The compound 5,7-dihydroxy-8-(2-methylbutanoyl)-6-(3-methylbutyl)-4-phenyl-chroman-2-one (3), the most active antileishmanial with LD₅₀ of 0.9 μM), induced cell shrinkage and a rounded appearance of the cells. Parasites incubated in the presence of compound (3) showed ultrastructural changes, such as the appearance of mitochondrial swelling with a reduction in the density of the mitochondrial matrix and the presence of vesicles inside the mitochondrion, indicating damage and significant change in this organelle; abnormal chromatin condensation, alterations in the nuclear envelope, intense atypical cytoplasmic vacuolization, and the appearance of autophagic vacuoles were also observed. In addition, the compound (3) may be acting to depolarize the mitochondrial membrane potential of the cells, leading to death of the parasite.
