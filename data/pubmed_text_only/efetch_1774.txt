We report the case of a 78-year-old woman, with previous narrow QRS atrial fibrillation, who in the presence of mild digoxin intoxication and severe hyperkalaemia, caused by chronic renal failure and usage of potassium sparing drugs, presented on her ECG two distinct wide QRS tachycardias. Initial treatment with low doses of procainamide resulted in severe bradycardia. Her original rhythm was restored after partial correction of hyperkalaemia with haemodialysis under continuous infusion of lidocaine. The electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalaemia and digoxin intoxication as well as the effect of lidocaine and procainamide on hyperkalaemia-induced wide QRS tachycardias are discussed.
An arsenical compound, As2O3 has been reported to be effective for treating acute leukemia and induce apoptosis in many different tumor cell types. In this study we designed a novel arsenical compound, As4O6, and compared its ability to induce cell growth inhibition as well as gene expression profiles along with As2O3 in HPV16 infected SiHa cervical cancer cells. Both As2O3 and As4O6 induced apoptosis in SiHa cells, as determined by a DNA ladder formation. As4O6 was more effective in suppressing the growth of SiHa cells in vitro, as compared to As2O3. To further compare gene expression profiles between these two drugs, we used a 384 cDNA microarray system. The gene expression profiles were also classified into the Gene Ontology (GO) to investigate apoptosis-related cellular processes. In the case of As2O3, 41 genes were up- or down-regulated at least 2-fold, as compared to non-treatment, whereas, 65 genes were up- or down-regulated by As4O6 treatment. In particular, 27 genes were commonly regulated by both arsenic compounds. The GO analysis also indicated that down-regulation of cell-regulatory functions, such as cell cycle, protein kinase activity and DNA repair, induces an anti-tumor effect. Taken together, these data support that As4O6 could be more effective than As2O3 in inhibiting the growth of HPV16 infected cervical cancer cells. This appears to be mediated through a unique but overlapping regulatory mechanism(s), suggesting that the regulated genes and cellular processes could be used for a new potential drug approach for treating cervical cancer in clinical settings.
The purpose of this study was to determine the cardiovascular effects of fluoxetine in depressed patients with cardiac disease.
Twenty-seven depressed patients (26% of whom were female and whose average age was 73 years) who had congestive heart failure, conduction disease, and/or ventricular arrhythmia were studied in an open medication trial of fluoxetine, up to 60 mg/day, for 7 weeks. The main outcome measures were heart rate and rhythm measured by 24-hour ECG recordings, ejection fraction determined by radionuclide angiography, cardiac conduction intervals, and blood pressure. Baseline values were compared with those at weeks 2 and 7 of fluoxetine treatment. In 60 comparable patients, values of these same cardiovascular measures at baseline and after 3 weeks of treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant, nortriptyline, were also examined.
Fluoxetine induced a statistically significant 6% decrease in heart rate, a 2% increase in supine systolic pressure, and a 7% increase in ejection fraction. There was no effect on cardiac conduction, ventricular arrhythmia, or orthostatic blood pressure. Overall, 4% of the fluoxetine patients had an adverse cardiovascular effect. In contrast, nortriptyline treatment caused a significant increase in heart rate and orthostatic hypotension, and 20% of the nortriptyline-treated patients had an adverse cardiovascular effect.
In depressed patients with heart disease, fluoxetine treatment was not associated with the cardiovascular effects documented for the tricyclic antidepressants or with significant adverse cardiac events. However, limited conclusions about fluoxetine's cardiovascular effects and safety can be drawn from this study of only 27 patients monitored for 7 weeks.
Severe neurotoxicity and acute renal failure developed in a patient with newly diagnosed AIDS while receiving high-dosage intravenous acyclovir for disseminated herpes zoster. Hemodialysis resulted in a rapid resolution of neurologic symptoms and was associated with a reduction in plasma acyclovir concentration. Acute hemodialysis therapy should be considered in cases of serious neurotoxicity secondary to acyclovir, especially when accompanied by renal failure.
The anti-ischemic properties of the new cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist celiprolol were investigated in an open study of 12 men (mean age: 58 +/- 6.6 years) with exercise-induced angina pectoris. After all previous anti-anginal medication had been withdrawn for at least 5 half-lives, the patients received placebo, single doses of nitroglycerin buccal spray, sublingual nifedipine, celiprolol alone, and then in association with nitroglycerin and nifedipine. Exercise tests were performed on a bicycle ergometer, with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Significantly more work was completed after treatment with celiprolol than at baseline (5280 +/- 2500 versus 4005 +/- 1792 kpm; P less than 0.01). There were further improvements in work completed after the addition of nitroglycerin and nifedipine. Celiprolol reduced the mean resting heart rate from a baseline value of 77.1 beats/min to 69.2 beats/min (P less than 0.01). In contrast, nifedipine induced tachycardia (82.6 beats/min). At rest, all treatments significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, but only nifedipine significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure. At the completion of the exercise protocol, celiprolol reduced the maximal systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.05) with further decreases after the addition of nifedipine. The double product was significantly decreased by celiprolol compared with control, nitroglycerin and nifedipine. There was a further improvement of the double product after the addition of nitroglycerin to celiprolol, but the further increase after addition of nifedipine was not significant. In conclusion, it is clear that celiprolol, both alone and in combination with nitroglycerin or nifedipine, can significantly increase the work capacity of patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris and significantly reduce myocardial oxygen consumption.
Research suggests that methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/;ecstasy' can cause serotonin depletion as well as serotonergic neurodegradation that may result in depression. This longitudinal study used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to assess depressive symptomatology every six months over a two-year period among a community sample of young adult MDMA/;ecstasy' users (n = 402). Multilevel growth modeling was used to analyze changes in BDI scores. Between baseline and 24 months, the mean BDI score declined from 9.8 to 7.7. Scores varied significantly across individuals at baseline and declined at a rate of 0.36 points every six months. Persons with higher baseline scores were more likely to have their scores decrease over time. Several factors were significantly associated with score levels, independent of time: gender - men's scores were lower than women's; ethnicity - whites' scores were lower than those of non-whites; education - persons with at least some university education had scores that were lower than those without any college experience; benzodiazepines - current users' scores were higher than non-users'; opioids - current users' scores were higher than non-users'; and cumulative ecstasy use - people who had used MDMA more than 50 times had scores that were higher than persons who had used the drug less often. The results reported here show low levels of depressive symptoms among a sample that, after 24 months, consisted of both current and former MDMA users. The low and declining mean scores suggest that for most people MDMA/;ecstasy' use does not result in long-term depressive symptomatology.
A case of femoral neuropathy from iliac muscle hematoma occurring in a patient treated with urokinase, subcutaneous heparin and aspirin for myocardial infarction is reported. Diagnosis of this complication was suspected on the basis of clinical signs and on the fact that the patient had received anticoagulants. Computed tomography allowed direct and clear visualization of the hematoma. Anticoagulant suspension followed by an early surgical decompression seems to be the ideal treatment for this neuropathy; however, our patient died for a reinfarction after stopping heparinic administration. This may indicate that, in some patients "at risk", it is better to reduce rather than stop anticoagulant therapy.
A recent trend of escalating use of cocaine/crack cocaine was observed in the UK. The number of mentions on death certificates; last year use of cocaine; treatment demand, number of drug offenders, seizures, prices and average purity levels were the indicators used for this descriptive and correlational study. Figures (1990-2004) were taken from official UK sources. A total of 1022 cocaine/crack cocaine death mentions (i.e. deaths from any cause where the presence of cocaine/crack cocaine was also detected) were identified, with cocaine/crack cocaine being the sole drug mentioned in 36% of cases. The number of cocaine/crack cocaine death mentions showed a year-on-year increase and correlated positively with the following cocaine (powder) figures: last year use (p < 0.001); number of offenders (p < 0.001) and number of seizures (p < 0.001), but correlated negatively with price (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the number of cocaine/crack cocaine death mentions correlated positively with the number of crack offenders (p < 0.001) and seizures (p < 0.001), but correlated negatively with both crack purity ( p < 0.001) and price (p < 0.05). With conditions of increasing drug availability having been met in the UK, decrease in cocaine prices were associated with higher consumption levels and this, in turn, contributed to the increase in number of cocaine-related fatalities. There are limitations with the information collected, since no distinction is usually made on medical death certificates between cocaine and crack cocaine. The present study being an ecological one, it proved difficult to address the role of confounding variables that may well explain some of the associations observed.
Deoxycholic acid conjugation, transport capacity, and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid, and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment. During [24-14C]sodium deoxycholate infusion, [14C]biliary bile acid secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Ethinyl estradiol-treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid. Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid, but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species. Furthermore, the rat converts deoxycholic acid, a poor choleretic, to taurocholic acid, a good choleretic. When this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment, sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid.
The cause of hearing loss after spinal anaesthesia is unknown. Up until now, the only factor studied has been the effect of the diameter of the spinal needle on post-operative sensorineural hearing loss. The aim of this study was to describe this hearing loss and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of hearing loss. Two groups of 22 similar patients were studied: one group received 6 mL prilocaine 2%; and the other received 3 mL bupivacaine 0.5%. Patients given prilocaine were more likely to develop hearing loss (10 out of 22) than those given bupivacaine (4 out of 22) (P < 0.05). The average hearing loss for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after prilocaine and 15 dB after bupivacaine. None of the patients complained of subjective hearing loss. Long-term follow-up of the patients was not possible.
Kounis syndrome is the concurrence of acute coronary syndromes with conditions associated with mast cell activation including allergic or hypersensitivity and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid insults. We present a case of acute myocardial infarction associated with an allergic reaction in a 73-year-old Italian woman with recent implantation of stents.
To determine the dosage and factors influencing efficacy of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for West syndrome.
A retrospective study of 135 patients receiving ACTH therapy with a synthetic analogue for initial effect, seizure outcome 1 year after therapy, and adverse effects. Efficacy and adverse effects were compared among the groups divided by clinical factors: dosage, treatment lag, onset age, and cause.
One hundred thirteen patients had seizure control with ACTH. For more than 1 year after ACTH, 59 remained seizure free. Adverse effects were observed in 57, and ACTH therapy was discontinued in 23. The lowest dosage group (0.0125 mg/kg/d) had fewer episodes of discontinuation (P<.05), whereas differences in efficacy between different dosages were insignificant. None of the clinical factors correlated with initial effect. The earlier-onset group (<4 months) showed unfavorable seizure outcome 1 year after ACTH (P<.01). The cryptogenic patients showed better seizure outcome (P<.05) compared with the symptomatic.
Synthetic ACTH therapy at a lower dosage is as effective as natural ACTH therapy at a higher dosage. Considering the adverse effects and the benefits for seizure control, the ACTH dosage of 0.0125 mg/kg/d (synthetic analogue) is more favorable than larger dosage.
The effects of wisanine and dihydrowisanine were studied on stereotyped and aggressive behaviour induced by apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in chicks. Pretreatment of chicks with wisanine (0.3-0.6 g/kg i.p.) and dihydrowisanine (0.2-0.4 g/kg i.p.) dose dependently antagonised fighting episodes and pecking of the chick's own feet and those of other chicks. It has been suggested that the antagonism is due to dopaminergic receptor blockade and demonstrates the antipsychotic effect of these drugs.
Isoniazid (INH) is an integral component of treatment of tuberculosis. An acute overdose is potentially fatal and is characterized by the clinical triad of repetitive seizures unresponsive to the usual anticonvulsants, metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap and coma. The diagnosis of INH overdose should be considered in any patient who presents to emergency medical services (EMS) with the triad. We report a patient presenting with multiple generalised tonic clonic (GTC) convulsions with severe metabolic acidosis as a manifestation of INH toxicity.
Proton pump inhibitors are commonly used in clinical practice for the treatment of peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux and are well tolerated by the patients. Their use is rarely associated with hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. According to the reports in the Uppsala Monitoring Center database the frequency of hypersensitivity reactions out of all reported adverse reactions for proton pump inhibitors and H2-histamine receptor antagonists was between 0.2% and 0.7%. A few cases of hypersensitivity to lansoprazole have been reported. We report a patient who developed Kounis syndrome after taking 30 mg of lansoprazole. This is the first report of Kounis syndrome associated with lansoprazole administration in the world literature.
Diverse epidemiological factors are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence in different populations. However, the global landscape of the genetic changes in HCC genomes underpinning different epidemiological and ancestral backgrounds still remains uncharted. Here a collection of data from 503 liver cancer genomes from different populations uncovered 30 candidate driver genes and 11 core pathway modules. Furthermore, a collaboration of two large-scale cancer genome projects comparatively analyzed the trans-ancestry substitution signatures in 608 liver cancer cases and identified unique mutational signatures that predominantly contribute to Asian cases. This work elucidates previously unexplored ancestry-associated mutational processes in HCC development. A combination of hotspot TERT promoter mutation, TERT focal amplification and viral genome integration occurs in more than 68% of cases, implicating TERT as a central and ancestry-independent node of hepatocarcinogenesis. Newly identified alterations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, chromatin remodelers and a high proportion of mTOR pathway activations offer potential therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities.
Chronic nicotine treatment has deleterious effects on vascular functioning and catecholamine modulation, which may compromise erectile functioning. Evidence that long-term cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for introducing impotence is robust. However, limited studies have focused on the acute effects of smoking on physiological sexual response, and none have investigated the deleterious effects of isolated nicotine on human sexual arousal. Consequently, pathophysiological underpinnings of tobacco-induced-and particularly, nicotine-induced-erectile dysfunction are not well understood.
To provide the first empirical examination of the acute effects of isolated nicotine on sexual arousal in nonsmoking men.
Twenty-eight sexually functional heterosexual men (mean age 21 years), each with less than 100 direct exposures to nicotine, participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Participants received either Nicorette polacrilex gum (SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) (6 mg; approximately equivalent to smoking one high-yield cigarette) or placebo gum, matched for appearance, taste, and consistency, approximately 40 minutes prior to viewing an erotic film.
Physiological (circumferential change via penile plethysmography) and subjective (continuous self-report) sexual responses to erotic stimuli were examined, as well as changes in mood.
Nicotine significantly reduced erectile responses to the erotic films (P = 0.02), corresponding to a 23% reduction in physiological sexual arousal. This occurred in 16 of 20 men with valid physiological recordings. Nicotine had no significant effect on continuous subjective ratings of sexual arousal (P = 0.70) or on mood (all Ps > 0.05).
Isolated nicotine can significantly attenuate physiological sexual arousal in healthy nonsmoking men. These findings have implications for elucidating physiological mechanisms responsible for the effects of nicotine on sexual dysfunction, and for assisting public health policy in considering the deleterious effects of nicotine on sexual health.
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of fentanyl and remifentanil on splanchnic perfusion during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Fifty patients were randomized to receive either fentanyl (10 microgxkg(-1) at induction and 5 microgxkg(-1)xh(-1) infusion for maintenance) or remifentanil (3 microgxkg(-1) at induction and 1 microgxkg(-1)xmin(-1) infusion for maintenance). Patients in both groups were comparable with regard to demographics. Intraoperative volume management and inotropic therapy were similiar in both groups. Regarding heart rate, there were no significant differences between the groups at any measurement time (P > 0.05). Compared to the fentanyl group, the remifentanil group showed a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure during induction. Also, the gastric intramucosal CO(2) pressure (Pg(CO) (2)) and the P(CO) (2)-gap, defined as the difference between Pg(CO) (2) and Pa(CO) (2), were significantly increased and the gastric mucosal pH (pHi) was significantly decreased in the remifentanil group in the postinduction period (P < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in respiratory data at any time between the two groups (P > 0.05). Both fentanyl and remifentanil seemed to be effective and well tolerated in this CABG population. Episodes of hypotension and transient reduction in splanchnic perfusion were more common in patients treated with remifentanil when compared to those receiving the fentanyl opioid regimen.
Febrile seizures affect 2-4% of all children and have a strong genetic component. Recurrent mutations in three main genes (SCN1A, SCN1B and GABRG2) have been identified that cause febrile seizures with or without epilepsy. Here we report the identification of mutations in STX1B, encoding syntaxin-1B, that are associated with both febrile seizures and epilepsy. Whole-exome sequencing in independent large pedigrees identified cosegregating STX1B mutations predicted to cause an early truncation or an in-frame insertion or deletion. Three additional nonsense or missense mutations and a de novo microdeletion encompassing STX1B were then identified in 449 familial or sporadic cases. Video and local field potential analyses of zebrafish larvae with antisense knockdown of stx1b showed seizure-like behavior and epileptiform discharges that were highly sensitive to increased temperature. Wild-type human syntaxin-1B but not a mutated protein rescued the effects of stx1b knockdown in zebrafish. Our results thus implicate STX1B and the presynaptic release machinery in fever-associated epilepsy syndromes.
To determine how men infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tolerate and respond to treatment for malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs), and how GCT histology and stage compare among HIV-infected versus non-HIV-infected men.
Two hundred ninety-four cases of GCT diagnosed or treated from 1980 to 1993 were reviewed. Nine new cases among HIV-infected men were identified; these were analyzed together with six cases previously reported from our institution.
Low-stage tumors (stages I and IIA) comprised 67% of HIV-infected and 63% of non-HIV-infected cases. Sixty-seven percent of HIV-infected cases were seminomas versus 51% of non-HIV-infected cases. Ten patients had AIDS at the time of GCT diagnosis. Five patients underwent radiation therapy and one patient underwent retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy without complications. Seven patients received chemotherapy with four cycles of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEB) or cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB) without excess cytopenias or new opportunistic infections. Of seven patients treated for advanced disease, there were five complete and two partial responses. Six patients have died of AIDS at a median of 20 months after diagnosis of GCT. The median follow-up time for surviving patients has been 42 months (range, 8 to 87) and all but one remain without evidence of active disease. In no case was a patient's HIV disease classification altered by antitumor therapy.
The natural history of GCTs is comparable in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected men and standard therapy including orchiectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is well tolerated.
The pathogenesis of complete transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is still controversial because useful animal models have not been established. We previously reported that all-trans retinoic acid induced complete TGA at a high proportion in mice. The aim of the present study was to clarify the morphogenesis of the cardiac outflow tract in the retinoic acid-treated embryos destined to develop TGA.
We first examined the morphology of TGA in mouse fetuses treated with retinoic acid to establish an animal model of TGA (experiment 1) and then examined the retinoic acid-treated embryonic hearts by means of ink injection and histology (experiment 2). All mouse fetuses and embryos showed visceroatrial situs solitus and d-ventricular loop. In experiment 1, among 45 embryos treated with retinoic acid 70 mg/kg at day 8.5 of gestation, 35 (78%) had TGA and 3 (6.7%) had a double-outlet right ventricle with a subpulmonary ventricular septal defect. In experiment 2, all hearts already exhibited d-loop at gestation day 8.5. At gestation day 9.5, conus swellings, composed of acellular cardiac jelly, where hypoplastic, and the conotruncal cavity was nonspiral or tubular. At gestation day 11.0, aberrant conus swellings located anteroposteriorly to give a straight orientation to the conotruncal cavity. At gestation day 12.0, side-by-side great arteries were transposed in that the aorta arose from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arose above the interventricular foramen.
These results suggest that a reproducible animal model of TGA can be produced in mice by treatment with retinoic acid; that there was no loop anomaly, such as an A-loop or L-loop, in our model; and that hypoplasia of the conus swellings appears to be the primary event leading to TGA.
Early adrenal insufficiency is associated with cardiopulmonary dysfunction in immature infants. Isolated cortisol levels and ACTH stimulation testing may not adequately show ontogeny of postnatal cortisol secretion nor identify at risk infants. Our objectives were 1) to determine postnatal urinary cortisol excretion rate (UCER) from birth to 14 d in immature baboons and 2) to evaluate the relation between UCER and cardiac performance. UCER was assessed via 6-h blocked urine collections from birth to 336 h of age in twenty-one 125-d gestation (term = 185 d) baboons. Urinary cortisol was measured by RIA. Cardiopulmonary parameters were averaged over the same time periods as urine collection. Serial two-dimensional echocardiograms were performed. After 24-h age, a subgroup (n = 8) received up to four doses (0.5-1.0 mg/kg each) of hydrocortisone for refractory hypotension. UCER significantly increased from 0 to 6 h through 66 to 72 h age for non-cortisol-treated infants. Significantly reduced UCER patterns between birth and 24 h were found for animals subsequently requiring cortisol treatment. Cortisol-treated infants had lower mean blood pressure, worse metabolic acidosis, increased fluid needs, and impaired left ventricular function between 12 and 48 h of age. No group differences were found in gas exchange or ventilator support. We conclude that adrenal cortisol secretion significantly improves over the initial 72 h of life in the 125-d immature baboon. Failure to increase UCER after 12-24 h of life correlated with poor cardiovascular function that improved with hydrocortisone therapy. Adrenal hypofunction in the immature baboon is similar to the very preterm human and could serve as a model for future postnatal investigations.
Although l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) is one of the most effective therapies for Parkinson's disease, continued treatment may result in excessive involuntary movements known as L-dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). Because LIDs can become dose-limiting, there is great interest in finding ways to ameliorate or prevent this troubling side effect of L-dopa therapy. It was recently reported that the D3 receptor partial agonist BP897 [N-[4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl)butyl]-2-naphthamide] reduces LIDs without diminishing antiparkinsonian effects of L-dopa in macaques. In the present study, we tested the effects of BP897 on LIDs in squirrel monkeys, a nonhuman primate particularly prone to dyskinesias. Parkinsonism was induced using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Animals were then gavaged with L-dopa/carbidopa (7.5 or 15 mg/kg/dose) without and with BP897. The effects of BP897 treatment were evaluated on several components of LIDs, including time course, peak dyskinesias, and area under the curve (AUC), a measure that encompasses both peak and duration of the response. Analyses of the time course and overall dyskinetic response (AUC) showed that BP897 significantly reduced LIDs but at the expense of the antiparkinsonian effect of L-dopa. BP897 had no significant effect on peak dyskinesias. Correlation studies showed that beneficial effects of BP897 on dyskinesias were linked to a decline in the antiparkinsonian action of L-dopa. Analyses of a subgroup of animals with mild/moderate parkinsonism yielded comparable results. Thus, in squirrel monkeys in contrast to macaques, BP897 fails to exert an antidyskinetic effect without diminishing the antiparkinsonian effects of L-dopa. These results suggest that BP897 may be less effective than originally anticipated for treating LIDs in Parkinson's disease.
