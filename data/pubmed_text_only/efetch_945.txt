The present study investigated the effects of the putative adenosine A1 receptor antagonist BIIP 20 ((S)-(-)-8-(3-oxocyclopentyl)-1,3-dipropyl-7H-purine-2,6-dione) on counteracting scopolamine-induced behavioral deficits in the rat in the passive avoidance paradigm. A single oral application of BIIP 20 (1 and 3 mg/kg) 90 min before the rats received the noxious stimulus significantly attenuated the scopolamine-induced deficits observed during the retention trial of this task.
The selective sigma1 receptor agonist 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-4-(3-phenyl propyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (SA4503) was reported to reverse the amnesia induced by the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine at sub-mg/kg doses. We examined its effect on the learning impairment induced in mice by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine. Learning capacities were evaluated using spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze for spatial working memory, and step-down type passive avoidance. SA4503 (0.03-1 mg/kg s.c.) attenuated the dizocilpine (0.15 mg/kg i.p.)-induced memory deficits following a bell-shaped curve in both tests. These effects of SA4503 were blocked by haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg i.p.), implicating sigma1 receptors. SA4503 also reversed the alternation deficit induced by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 mg/kg i.p.) at the same dosage, indicating that it acted on working memory through the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated signalling pathway. Furthermore, progesterone (2 mg/kg s.c.) blocked the SA4503 effects in the dizocilpine- and L-NAME-amnesia models, in accordance with the purported neurosteroids/sigma1 receptors interaction. These results demonstrate a promising neurobehavioural profile of SA4503, a ligand equally efficient to reverse the deficit in the glutamatergic as well as in the cholinergic amnesia model. Pertinent informations on the potential mechanism of the anti-amnesic effects of sigma1 receptor ligands were also obtained.
Smoking during pregnancy is associated with numerous physiological and neurobehavioral deficits in infants, which persist into adolescence. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we have treated pregnant rats with nicotine and have evaluated expression of the immediate early gene c-fos, as a measure of neuronal activity, in the brains of adolescent male offspring. Pregnant dams were infused with nicotine (3 mg/kg/day) or saline from gestational day (G) 4 until G18. After birth on G22, litters were cross fostered and weaned at postnatal day (P) 21. Brain sections from adolescent offspring, aged P38-40, were analyzed by in situ hybridization for regional c-fos mRNA expression in response to acute injection of saline or nicotine (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mg/kg). Acute nicotine challenge increased c-fos expression within nucleus accumbens shell, lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, dorsal lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus, whereas c-fos expression was decreased in prelimbic cortex. There was no effect of gestational nicotine treatment on acute nicotine-induced alterations in c-fos mRNA levels. However, basal c-fos mRNA expression within infralimbic cortex and nucleus accumbens core was increased by gestational nicotine treatment. These data indicate that gestational nicotine does not produce global changes in nicotine-induced c-fos expression in adolescent brain. However, gestational drug exposure changes basal neuronal activity within mesocorticolimbic structures that are critical for motivated behavior. Such changes may underlie some of the behavioral deficits in attention, cognition, and impulse control that have been reported in the offspring of smoking mothers.
In basal conditions, thyroid epithelial cells produce moderate amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are physiologically required for thyroid hormone synthesis. They are not necessarily toxic because they are continuously detoxified either in the process of hormone synthesis or by endogenous antioxidant systems. Using a rat model of goiter formation and iodine-induced involution, we found that compared with control thyroids, the oxidative stress, assessed by the detection of 4-hydroxynonenal, was strongly enhanced both in hyperplastic and involuting glands. The level of antioxidant defenses (glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins) was also up-regulated in both groups, although somewhat less in the latter. Of note, increased oxidative stress came along with an inflammatory reaction, but only in involuting glands, suggesting that although antioxidant systems can adequately buffer a heavy load of ROS in goiter, it is not necessarily the case in involuting glands. The effects of 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2), an endogenous ligand of peroxisome proliferated-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) with antiinflammatory properties, were then investigated in involuting glands. This drug strongly reduced both 4-hydroxynonenal staining and the inflammatory reaction, indicating that it can block iodine-induced cytotoxicity. When experiments were carried out with the PPARgamma antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, 15dPGJ2-induced effects remained unchanged, suggesting that these effects were not mediated by PPARgamma. In conclusion, thyroid epithelial cells are well adapted to endogenously produced ROS in basal and goitrous conditions. In iodine-induced goiter involution, the increased oxidative stress is accompanied by inflammation that can be blocked by 15dPGJ2 through PPARgamma-independent protective effects.
The anticancer drug adriamycin (ADR) induces severe nonselective glomerular proteinuria in rats. The proliferation of the glomerular mesangium in chronic ADR nephrosis suggests a disturbed metabolism of extracellular matrix proteins. In the present study the structural protein fibronectin was analyzed by immunological methods in urine and plasma in two rat strains after a single injection of 5 mg of ADR/kg b.wt. After ADR administration the excretion of 220 kd-plasma fibronectin, identified by its electrophoretic mobility and Western blotting, increased. This was confirmed by quantitative measurement (ELISA) of total urinary fibronectin (ADR-treated Munich Wistar Frömter rats: 85.4 +/- 49.5 ng/hr, N = 31; controls: 1.7 +/- 0.7 ng/hr, N = 26; day 7 after ADR injection). Control urines contained distinct fragments of fibronectin with a molecular weight range of 40 to 60 kd. It is suggested that these fragments did not originate from plasma inasmuch as only little correspondence between the fibronectin patterns of urine and plasma was found, and also because in ADR-treated rats the excretion of the fibronectin fragments decreased from day 4 of ADR administration. The data suggest that the urinary fibronectin fragments are released from cellular fibronectin during the normal catabolism of the glomerular extracellular matrices, and that ADR interferes in the metabolism of matrix components. Only as a consequence of an enhanced glomerular permeability is plasma fibronectin excreted in ADR-treated rats.
Current therapy for lung cancer involves multimodality therapies. However, many patients are either refractory to therapy or develop drug resistance. KRAS and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations represent some of the most common mutations in lung cancer, and many studies have shown the importance of these mutations in both carcinogenesis and chemoresistance. Genetically engineered murine models of mutant EGFR and KRAS have been developed that more accurately recapitulate human lung cancer. Recently, using cell-based experiments, we showed that platinum-based drugs and the antidiabetic drug rosiglitazone (PPARgamma ligand) interact synergistically to reduce cancer cell and tumor growth. Here, we directly determined the efficacy of the PPARgamma/carboplatin combination in these more relevant models of drug resistant non-small cell lung cancer.
Tumorigenesis was induced by activation of either mutant KRAS or EGFR. Mice then received either rosiglitazone or carboplatin monotherapy, or a combination of both drugs. Change in tumor burden, pathology, and evidence of apoptosis and cell growth were assessed.
Tumor burden remained unchanged or increased in the mice after monotherapy with either rosiglitazone or carboplatin. In striking contrast, we observed significant tumor shrinkage in mice treated with these drugs in combination. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that this synergy was mediated via both increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Importantly, this synergy between carboplatin and rosiglitazone did not increase systemic toxicity.
These data show that the PPARgamma ligand/carboplatin combination is a new therapy worthy of clinical investigation in lung cancers, including those cancers that show primary resistance to platinum therapy or acquired resistance to targeted therapy.
Classical neonatal diabetes mellitus is defined as hyperglycemia that occurs within the first month of life in term infants. It can be either permanent or transient. Cerebellar agenesis and permanent neonatal diabetes has been previously reported as a new autosomal recessive disorder. Pancreas Transcription Factor 1 Alpha (PTF1A) mutations have been related with this constellation of abnormalities. Here we report a new case of cerebellar agenesis and neonatal diabetes mellitus whose parents are PTF1A mutation carriers.
Human fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is an enterohepatic hormone that is involved in the regulation of hepatic metabolism of bile acids, lipids, and glucose. Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr)-null mice exhibit steatosis-like symptoms, showing higher hepatic lipid levels than with the wild-type mice. We investigated the influence of FGF19 treatment on hepatic lipogenesis in Fxr-null mice. Recombinant FGF19 treatment (400 µg/kg/d) for 3 d prevented the accumulation of lipid droplets and decreased serum alanine aminotransferase activity and hepatic lipid levels, including those of triglycerides and free fatty acids. The treatment significantly decreased the hepatic mRNA levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc1), Cd36, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (Srebp-1c) as well as those of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (Acc2), stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1), and Cyp7a1. FGF19 treatment (4 µg/kg/d) for 3 d also decreased the hepatic free fatty acid levels and mRNA levels of Acc1, Cd36, and Srebp-1c. These results indicate that FGF19-mediated signaling ameliorates disrupted hepatic lipogenesis in Fxr-null mice.
The effect of finger tremor of the administration of 150 mg of caffeine three times daily for two days was measured using an accelerometer in 7 healthy subjects taking their normal diet (excluding caffeine-containing beverages). The effect on finger tremor of a short period of fasting with and without the 450 mg daily dose of caffeine was also studied in the same 7 subjects. Fasting increased finger tremor significantly when caffeine was administered. In doses comparable to the likely adult daily intake in this country, caffeine did not increase finger tremor whilst subjects were taking their normal diet.
Chronic exposure to n-hexane may result in peripheral neuropathy. 2,5-Hexanedione (2,5-HD) has been identified as a toxic metabolite of n-hexane. The CYP2E1, CYP1A1 and GST genes are involved in the formation of 2,5-hexanedione from n-hexane as well as the elimination of 2,5-HD-formed electrophile, and these genes are highly polymorphic in the general population. A nested case-control study in an industrial cohort was conducted to evaluate the associations between polymorphisms in these metabolic genes and n-hexane-induced peripheral nerve damage. The study subjects included 22 cases, who worked in a printing factory with symptoms of peripheral nerve damage, and 163 controls, who came from the same factory of cases. DNA was extracted from blood samples and genotyping was conducted for CYP2E1 Pst, CYP2E1 Dra, CYP2E1 Ins96, CYP1A1 Msp, GSTT1 null, GSTM1 null and GSTP1 105V. Unconditional logistic regression was applied to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age, sex, smoking and alcohol status. A significant association between Dra polymorphism and peripheral nerve damage was found. The frequency of CYP2E1 Dra homozygous mutation in the case group (18.2%) was higher than that in the control group (3.7%, p=0.015). Individuals with homozygote genotype (CC) of CYP2E1 Dra had a significantly higher risk of peripheral nerve damage compared with those with DD genotype (adjusted OR=?.58, 95% CI=1.32-23.65) after n-hexane exposure duration, sex, age, smoking and alcohol status were adjusted. No significant association was found that CYP2E1 Pst, CYP2E1 Ins96, CYP1A1 Msp, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP gene polymorphisms associated with the susceptibility of peripheral nerve damage. These findings suggested that CYP2E1 gene might increase the susceptibility to n-hexane-induced peripheral damage.
We evaluated the expression of seven therapy-related genes to predict the clinical outcome of advanced gastric cancer patients treated with a neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic protocol.
Pretherapeutic, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded biopsies of 61 patients, who received a 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)- and cisplatin-based chemotherapy were studied. The expressions of the 5-FU-related genes TS, DPD, and TP and of the cisplatin-related genes ERCC1, ERCC4, KU80, and GADD45A were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression levels of single genes and of various combinations were tested for an association with response and overall survival.
High DPD levels were more frequently found in nonresponding patients and were associated with worse survival. GADD45A and TP levels showed weak associations with response, but GADD45A expression correlated with survival. There was no association with response for TS expression, but tumors with a high TS level were associated with worse survival. The combination of GADD45A and TP revealed the strongest predictive effect. High expression values of TP and/or GADD45A were exclusively found in nonresponding patients (P = 0.002) and were associated with a significantly poorer survival (P = 0.04).
Combined gene expression levels of TP and GADD45A represent a new variable to predict the clinical outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer. The association of DPD expression with response and survival underlines a predominant role of DPD to predict 5-FU sensitivity. The association of TS expression levels with survival but not with response suggests an importance of this gene for tumor progression.
In many clinical settings, the duration of renal ischemia and therefore the outcome of acute renal failure cannot be determined adequately. Renal ischemia reperfusion injury is known to shorten telomeres and upregulate stress-induced genes, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21. So far, the expression and role of CDK inhibitors, as well as mouse telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTERT), has not been investigated in a model with variable lasting ischemic periods. Male C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to renal ischemia reperfusion injury by clamping both renal pedicles for 10, 20, 30, and 45 min, and the kidneys were allowed to be reperfused for 3, 24, and 48 h. Expression of different CDK inhibitors and mTERT was evaluated. Mice developed signs of acute renal failure linear to the duration of the ischemic period. Real-time PCR revealed that mTERT was only significantly upregulated in kidneys after short ischemic periods (20 min). In contrast, p21 was constantly upregulated in kidneys after long ischemic intervals (30 and 45 min), but not in kidneys, which were clamped for shorter periods. Mainly, tubular cells contributed to the observed increase in p21 expression. Targeting p21 via the selective p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha was able to prevent acute renal failure when administered immediately before ischemia. The expression of another CDK inhibitor, namely p16, was differentially regulated, depending on the time of reperfusion. Taken together, we detected mTERT and p21 as "indicator" genes for short and long ischemic intervals, respectively. These two proteins might also be possible new therapeutic targets in the treatment and prevention of acute renal failure.
Refsum's Disease is an inherited metabolic disorder in which a metabolite of branched chain fatty acids accumulates due to lack of appropriate oxidative enzymes. Patients have elevated plasma phytanic acid levels and high concentrations of phytanic acid in a variety of tissues leading to progressive tissue damage. Besides retinal degeneration or retinal dystrophy associated with adult onset retinitis pigmentosa, additional symptoms include chronic polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, sensorineural hearing loss, anosmia, ichthyosis, as well as skeletal, cardiac, hepatic, and renal abnormalities. Current management includes avoidance of dietary sources of branched chain fatty acids and regular plasmapheresis to prevent accumulation of these compounds to ameliorate progressive neurological deficits. Two brothers with Refsum's disease who experienced progressive symptoms despite optimal diet and plasmapheresis were commenced on a novel therapy. We report the effect of the intestinal lipase inhibitor, Orlistat, which led to significant reduction (P-value <0.001 on 2-sample unpaired t-test) of mean preplasmapheresis phytanic acid levels with retardation of the progression of most of their dermatological and neurological symptoms.
Activation of nonselective cation channels of the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) family has been associated with hypertension. Whether store-operated channels, which are activated after depletion of intracellular stores, or second-messenger-operated channels, which are activated by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, are affected in essential hypertension is presently unknown.
Using a polymerase chain reaction, an in-cell western assay and the fluorescent dye technique we studied TRPC3, TRPC5, and TRPC6 expression and store-operated and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-induced calcium influx into human monocytes in 19 patients with essential hypertension and in 17 age-matched and sex-matched normotensive control individuals.
We observed a significantly increased expression of TRPC3 and TRPC5, but not TRPC6, in essential hypertension. Store-operated calcium influx was significantly elevated in essential hypertension. Store-operated calcium influx was reduced by the inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane, specific TRPC3 and TRPC5 knockdown, but not TRPC6 knockdown using gene silencing by RNA interference. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-induced calcium influx and barium influx were also significantly elevated in essential hypertension. The 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-induced cation influx was reduced by TRPC3 and TRPC5 knockdown.
We demonstrated an increased TRPC3 and TRPC5 expression and a subsequently increased store-operated calcium influx and increased 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-induced cation influx in monocytes of patients with essential hypertension. This increased activation of monocytes through TRPC channels in patients with essential hypertension may promote vascular disease in these patients.
Evodiamine is an alkaloidal compound with antiobesity effects that have been thought to be due to uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) thermogenesis similar to the effects of capsaicin, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To clarify the mechanisms, we first examined whether the antiobesity effect of evodiamine could be attributed to the involvement of UCP1. When UCP1-knockout mice were fed a high-fat diet with 0.03% evodiamine (wt/wt) for 2 months, the increases in body weight, adiposity, and the serum levels of leptin and insulin were reduced in a manner indistinguishable from control mice fed a high-fat diet with evodiamine, suggesting that evodiamine triggered a UCP1-independent mechanism to prevent diet-induced obesity. By using preadipocyte cultures, we found that evodiamine, but not capsaicin, increased phosphorylation of ERK/MAPK, reduced the expression of transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, and strongly inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Evodiamine treatment also reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, a crucial regulator of adipocyte differentiation; and the reduction of phosphorylated-Akt and augmentation of phosphorylated ERK were reversed by blockade of the MAPK kinase/MAPK signaling pathway, restoring adipogenesis in the cultures. The changes in ERK and Akt phosphorylation levels were also observed in white adipose tissues of UCP1-knockout mice fed the evodiamine diet. These findings suggest that evodiamine has a potential to prevent the development of diet-induced obesity in part by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation through ERK activation and its negative cross talk with the insulin signaling pathway.
Because of its favorable side effects profile, the oral chelating agent dimercaptosuccinic acid is often used for treatment of lead intoxication. We report a case of a 45-year-old black male with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and a 17 year history of occupational lead exposure who developed hemolysis during treatment with dimercaptosuccinic acid for symptomatic lead intoxication.
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is highly efficacious in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9) is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in arsenic uptake. In 10 of 11 myeloid and lymphoid leukemia lines, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Western blotting showed that AQP9 expression correlated positively with As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. As a proof-of-principle, transfection of EGFP-tagged AQP9 to the hepatoma line Hep3B, not expressing AQP9 and As2O3 insensitive, led to membrane AQP9 expression and increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, the chronic myeloid leukemia line K562 expressed low levels of AQP9 and was As2O3 insensitive. The K562(EGFP-AQP9) transfectant accumulated significantly higher levels of intracellular arsenic than control K562(EGFP) when incubated with As2O3, resulting in significantly increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the myeloid leukemia line HL-60 with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) up-regulated AQP9, leading to a significantly increased arsenic uptake and As2O3-induced cytotoxicity on incubation with As2O3, which might explain the synergism between ATRA and As2O3. Therefore, AQP9 controlled arsenic transport and might determine As2O3 sensitivity. Q-PCR showed that primary APL cells expressed AQP9 significantly (2-3 logs) higher than other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), which might explain their exquisite As2O3 sensitivity. However, APL and AML with maturation expressed comparable AQP9 levels, suggesting that AQP9 expression was related to granulocytic maturation.
A 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum, etoposide, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma. He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion, disorientation and irritability, and then lapsed into a deep coma, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion. This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid, which were then the only drugs given. Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition, neurotoxicity due to high-dose 5-fluorouracil was highly suspected. The pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate, thiamine deficiency, or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency. High-dose 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers. It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication.
Arachidonic acid metabolism via the cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways modulates cell growth and apoptosis. Many studies have examined the effects of COX inhibitors on human colorectal cancer, but the role of 5-LOX in colonic cancer development has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of 5-LOX in colonic polyps and cancer and the effect of 5-LOX inhibition on colon cancer cell proliferation.
Colonic polyps, cancer, and normal mucosa were evaluated for 5-LOX expression by immunohistochemistry. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to establish 5-LOX expression in colon cancer cells. Thymidine incorporation and cell counts were used to determine the effect of the nonspecific LOX inhibitor Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid and the 5-LOX inhibitor Rev5901 on DNA synthesis. A heterotopic xenograft model in athymic mice using HT29 and LoVo human colon cancer cells was used to evaluate the effect of the 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton on tumor growth.
5-LOX is overexpressed in adenomatous polyps and cancer compared with that of normal colonic mucosa. LOX inhibition and 5-LOX inhibition decreased DNA synthesis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in the Lovo cell line (P < 0.05). Inhibition of 5-LOX in an in vivo colon cancer xenograft model inhibited tumor growth compared with that of controls (P < 0.05).
This study showed that 5-LOX is up-regulated in adenomatous colon polyps and cancer compared with normal colonic mucosa. The blockade of 5-LOX inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo and may prove a beneficial chemopreventive therapy in colon cancer.
There is a long-standing debate concerning the localization of the primary insult that results in distal axonal degeneration, or 'dying back' neuropathy. To address this question, we created an in vitro model of vincristine neuropathy in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG). DRGs were grown in compartmentalized chambers, allowing for isolated exposure of the cell body or the axon to vincristine. Initial dose-finding studies identified a dose of vincristine that showed differential effects on cell death when delivered to either the cell body or the axonal compartment. At this dose of 0.05 microM, exposure of the cell bodies had no effect on the growth of axons, whereas addition of vincristine to the axonal compartment caused axonal shortening without affecting the growth of unexposed 'sister' axons. Toxicity was seen only with exposure of the growing axonal tips. These data support localized axonal toxicity as a cause of distal axonal degeneration due to vincristine.
An increasing proportion of the patients with chronic pain are being treated with opioids on a long-term basis. There are indications that the causes of hypersomnia in patients under chronic opioid therapy are primarily related to breathing disorders during sleep. Hence, we compared the polysomnographies of three hypersomnic patients receiving long-term opioid therapy before and during nocturnal non-invasive ventilatory therapy. Significant findings were a central breathing pattern accompanied by reduced deep and REM sleep. On applying non-invasive ventilatory therapy, there was a significant improvement of respiratory status with an increase of deep sleep as well as a moderate decrease in hypersomnia. In patients under chronic opioid therapy with hypersomnia, the presence of central breathing disorders should be considered.
While negative effect of smoking on the resistance to viral infections was known, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. Here we report that products of cigarette smoking compromise the cellular anti-viral defenses by inhibiting the signaling induced by Type I interferon (IFN). Cigarette smoking condensate (but not pure nicotine) stimulated specific serine phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of the IFNAR1 subunit of the Type I IFN receptor leading to attenuation of IFN signaling and decreased resistance to viral infection. This resistance was restored in cells where phosphorylation-dependent degradation of IFNAR1 is abolished. We conclude that smoking compromises cellular anti-viral defenses via degradation of Type I IFN receptor and discuss the significance of this mechanism for efficacy of IFN-based therapies.
Recent studies suggest that standard dose chemotherapy for breast cancer may cross the blood-brain barrier. However, the evidence for chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments in breast cancer patients is inconsistent. The purposes of this study in a sample of newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer were to (1) evaluate cognitive function prior to the administration of chemotherapy; (2) assess changes in cognitive function over time; and (3) evaluate potential relationships between cognitive function and anxiety, depression, fatigue, hemoglobin level, menopausal status, and perception of cognitive function.
Thirty women with breast cancer completed neuropsychological testing before the initiation of chemotherapy and after four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics, and paired t-tests were carried out to evaluate for changes in neuropsychological test scores prior to and following completion of chemotherapy. Linear mixed model analyses were used to determine whether significant changes in neuropsychological test scores remained after controlling for anxiety, depression, fatigue, hemoglobin level, menopausal status, and perceived cognitive function.
Significant decreases in visuospatial skill (p<0.001) and total cognitive scores (p=0.001) were found following chemotherapy. In addition, a significant improvement was found in executive function (p=0.014). Of note, these changes remained significant even after controlling for anxiety, depression, fatigue, hemoglobin level, menopausal status, and perceived cognitive function.
Data from this study supported the hypothesis that chemotherapy may have a negative impact on select domains of cognitive function.
Inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity decreases eicosanoid production and prevents lung cancer in animal models. Prostaglandin (PG) I(2) (PGI(2), prostacyclin) is a PGH(2) metabolite with anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antimetastatic properties. The instability of PGI(2) has limited its evaluation in animal models of cancer. We hypothesized that pulmonary overexpression of prostacyclin synthase may prevent the development of murine lung tumors. Transgenic mice with selective pulmonary prostacyclin synthase overexpression were exposed to two distinct carcinogenesis protocols: an initiation/promotion model and a simple carcinogen model. The transgenic mice exhibited significantly reduced lung tumor multiplicity (tumor number) in proportion to transgene expression, a dose-response effect. Moreover, the highest expressing mice demonstrated reduced tumor incidence. To investigate the mechanism for protection, we evaluated PG levels and inflammatory responses. At the time of sacrifice following one carcinogenesis model, the transgenics exhibited only an increase in 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), not a decrease in PGE(2). Thus, elevated PGI(2) levels and not decreased PGE(2) levels appear to be necessary for the chemopreventive effects. When exposed to a single dose of butylated hydroxytoluene, transgenic mice exhibited a survival advantage; however, reduction in alveolar inflammatory response was not observed. These studies demonstrate that manipulation of PG metabolism downstream from COX produces even more profound lung cancer reduction than COX inhibition alone and could be the basis for new approaches to understanding the pathogenesis and prevention of lung cancer.
The molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by cadmium, a human carcinogen, were investigated by differential gene expression analysis of BALB/c-3T3 cells transformed with cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)). Differential display analysis of gene expression revealed consistent overexpression of mouse translation initiation factor 3 (TIF3; GenBank accession number AF271072) in the cells transformed with CdCl(2) when compared with nontransformed cells. The predicted protein encoded by TIF3 cDNA exhibited 99% similarity to human eukaryotic initiation factor 3 p36 protein. A M(r) 36,000 protein was detected in cells transfected with an expression vector containing TIF3 cDNA. Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with an expression vector containing TIF3 cDNA resulted in overexpression of the encoded protein, and this was associated with cell transformation, as evidenced by the appearance of transformed foci exhibiting anchorage-independent growth on soft agar and tumorigenic potential in nude mice. Expression of the antisense RNA against TIF3 mRNA resulted in significant reversal of oncogenic potential of the CdCl(2)-transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that the cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by CdCl(2) are due, at least in part, to the overexpression of TIF3, a novel cadmium-responsive proto-oncogene.
