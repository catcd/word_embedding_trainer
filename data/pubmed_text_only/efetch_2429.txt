We report on two infants (two and six month old) with infantile myoclonic seizures, who developed signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), while receiving ACTH treatment (Tetracosactid=Synacthen Depot). The diagnosis of HCM was established by echocardiography. The first patient (R.M. female). showed signs of cardiac insufficiency and was treated with a beta-blocking agent (Propranolol=Dociton). This led to resolution of the clinical symptoms and reversal of myocardial muscle thickness as determined by echocardiography. The second patient (R.S. female) did not develop cardiac symptoms. A correlation between cardiomyopathy and ACTH treatment is discussed. Based on the various biological effects of ACTH different hypothetical explanations for this correlation are proposed: increased deposition of glycogen, enhanced protein synthesis, oedema of the myocardial tissue and systemic hypertension. Because of the correlation observed between ACTH treatment and the development of cardiomyopathy we recommend regular physical and echocardiographic examinations to detect cardiac involvement during treatment with ACTH.
Dichlorvos (DDVP) is used as an antihelmetic, principally in dogs, cats, pigs and horses. Retina, whole blood, erythrocyte, plasma and brain cholinesterase (ChE) activities were monitored following DDVP exposure in cats to establish their use as indicators of exposure to a ChE inhibitor. Following DDVP exposure, whole blood ChE activity was 16.8% of preexposure, erythrocyte ChE activity was 33% of preexposure, and plasma ChE was 19% of preexposure values. Brain and retinal ChE activities were reduced to 45% and 43% of control values. Retinal ChE paralleled brain activity.
The kinetic characteristics of binding of [3H]-GABA and the pattern of isoniazid-induced convulsions were studied in rats treated with repeated intraventricular injections of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) (10 micrograms/rat, twice daily for 8 days). Thirty-six hours after the last injection, the total number of binding sites for [3H]-GABA was decreased (25%) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the dissociation constant (KD) between beta-CCE and solvent-treated rats. The decrease in binding sites for [3H]-GABA was paralleled by a strong potentiation of the convulsant pattern elicited by isoniazid. The results suggest that the proconvulsant effect elicited by beta-CCE is mediated by the decrease in the total number of binding sites for GABA, secondary to the interaction between beta-CCE and the benzodiazepine receptor coupled to the GABA receptor.
The purpose of this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of optimized dosages of clonazepam for the treatment of panic disorder and assess the tolerability of a schedule for gradual discontinuation.
Adult patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (DSM-III-R criteria) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or clonazepam in individually adjusted doses over 3 weeks to approximate an optimal dosage, which was then maintained for an additional 3 weeks, amounting to a 6-week therapeutic phase. The daily dose range was 0.25 to 4.0 mg administered in 2 divided doses. In the following 7-week discontinuance phase, the doses were tapered gradually to cessation.
At the therapeutic endpoint, clonazepam (N = 222) proved clinically and statistically superior to placebo (N = 216) in change in the number of panic attacks and in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and CGI-Change scores, Patient's Global Impression of Change scores, amount of fear and avoidance associated with phobic symptoms, and duration of anticipatory anxiety. The gradual tapering of clonazepam was not associated with symptoms suggestive of withdrawal syndrome. Although patients taking clonazepam experienced some clinical worsening compared with the status achieved at endpoint, particularly in terms of number of panic attacks, no deterioration was observed using their condition at baseline as point of reference. No overall evidence of rebound was found. All regimens were generally well tolerated. Somnolence was the main adverse event associated with clonazepam therapy. The percentage of patients who reported adverse events was higher in the clonazepam group than in the placebo group, as was the mean number of adverse events per patient.
In this placebo-controlled trial, clonazepam was an efficacious and safe shortterm treatment of the symptoms of panic disorder. Discontinuance during and after slow tapering was well tolerated.
Idiopathic voiding disorders affect up to 10-15% of men and women. We describe bladder abnormalities in mice with targeted deletion of the gene for neuronal nitric oxide synthase which model the clinical disorders. The mice possess hypertrophic dilated bladders and dysfunctional urinary outlets which do not relax in response to electrical field stimulation or L-arginine. The mice also display increased urinary frequency.
This is the second case report of a woman with bipolar disorder type I who noted the onset of persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) symptoms after abrupt cessation of paroxetine. With the worsening of PGAD symptoms, she developed severe depression and suicidal thoughts, resulting in her undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as management.
To describe a case of PGAD and develop hypotheses to explain the beneficial actions of ECT on PGAD based on 4 years of ECT administration.
Patient self-report after obtaining consent, as well as literature review.
After the fourth ECT, the patient's PGAD symptoms abated serendipitously. She was placed on ECT on demand for the treatment of her PGAD. With each ECT treatment, PGAD symptoms immediately disappeared, relapsing slowly over time until the next ECT was administered. The patient has, thus far, received a total of 30 treatments of ECT. Side effects continue to be minimal and include brief short-term memory loss, headache, and muscle aches.
ECT is known to induce cerebral excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter changes after acute and chronic administration. Sexual arousal is stimulated by the action of hypothalamic and limbic dopamine, noradrenaline, melanocortin, and oxytocin, and inhibited by serotonin, cerebral opioids, and endocannabinoids. Based on the patient's bipolar disorder, the mechanism of action of ECT and the observation of ECT effectiveness on her PGAD, we hypothesize the following: (i) bipolar disorder led to central hyperactive dopamine release, an important component in the pathophysiology of her PGAD; (ii) central serotonin deficiency after selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) withdrawal resulted in a lack of inhibition of sexual excitement; (iii) ECT resulted in lowering of the hyperstimulated central dopamine release; and (iv) ECT led to an increase in sexual inhibition by stimulating serotonin activity. Further research in the central control of sexual arousal is needed.
Chronic aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats is an experimental analogue of human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This study was undertaken to define the effects of chronic nephrosis on the pituitary-ovarian axis and on fertility. Chronic nephrosis was induced by puromycin aminonucleoside and followed for 112 days. The estrous cycle was evaluated daily in all rats, whereas biochemical parameters, hormonal concentrations, and fertility were measured on Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 112 (n = 8). Animals were divided in four experimental groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A was used to determine LH, FSH, progesterone, and estradiol concentrations. Group B was used to evaluate fertility, and groups C and D were added to clarify the role of male rats in the fertility of nephrotic female rats. The results showed a persistent proteinuria in nephrotic rats; the estrous cycle of nephrotic animals was disrupted. The LH and estradiol concentrations were significantly low at all time points evaluated, whereas no significant changes were noted in FSH or progesterone values. In addition, fertility and litter size were diminished in nephrotic female rats. Interestingly, the presence of a male rat or its urine resulted in a positive influence on serum estradiol concentrations of nephrotic female rats. These data indicate that experimental chronic nephrosis results in a pituitary-ovarian dysfunction that is characterized by low LH concentration, hypoestrogenism, failure of the hormonal feedback control, and diminution of fertility. In addition, they show the positive effect of a male rat on the fertility of a nephrotic female, which strongly suggests the participation of pheromones.
1 The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, acebutolol (M & B 17,803), has been compared with propranolol, practolol, lignocaine and quinidine for its ability to revert or prevent various types of experimental arrhythmias.2 By intravenous infusion, acebutolol had one half the potency of propranolol in reverting an established ouabain-induced ventricular arrhythmia in the anaesthetized dog. Practolol was ineffective in the conditions used.3 High oral doses of acebutolol or propranolol significantly increased the arrhythmic dose of ouabain in the conscious rabbit. Similar doses of practolol produced a significant decrease (i.e. potentiation) in the dose of ouabain required to produce arrhythmia. Lignocaine and quinidine showed no or little activity in this test.4 Propranolol, acebutolol and practolol were all effective in decreasing the frequency of ectopic beats induced by adrenaline and methylchloroform in the anaesthetized cat. Lignocaine and quinidine were only weakly effective.5 Acebutolol and propranolol were equally effective either intravenously or orally in reducing the incidence of ventricular fibrillation produced by chloroform in mice.6 It is suggested that the wide spectrum of experimental anti-arrhythmic activity of acebutolol coupled with its cardioselectivity may make it an interesting compound in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in man.
We retrospectively studied 28 patients with 38 episodes of newly occurring ventricular fibrillation during antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Twenty-six of these patients, who had ventricular fibrillation during single-drug therapy with quinidine, procainamide, or disopyramide, were compared with a control group of 62 patients who had been treated similarly for ventricular arrhythmias but did not have ventricular fibrillation during treatment. The median duration of therapy before ventricular fibrillation was three days. The left ventricular ejection fraction of the study group was lower than that of the control group (0.29 vs. 0.43; P less than 0.0001), and concomitant treatment with digitalis and diuretic agents was more common in the study group. The base-line QT interval (corrected for heart rate) was slightly longer in the study group than in the controls (0.47 vs. 0.44; P less than 0.005), although both groups had similar degrees of QT prolongation during drug therapy. Four of 13 patients (31 percent) who underwent multiple trials of antiarrhythmic drugs had recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation. Six patients died suddenly after a mean follow-up of 18 months--four who were receiving antiarrhythmic therapy and two who were not. We conclude that drug-associated ventricular fibrillation is an early event, that there may be an increased risk of its recurrence with subsequent trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, and that left ventricular dysfunction and concomitant therapy with digitalis and diuretic agents may predispose patients to this complication.
A case is reported of sustained electromechanical dissociation due to deliberate disopyramide over-dosage in a young healthy girl. Circulatory recovery was achieved with standard resuscitative measures, including prolonged cardiac massage and isoproterenol infusion plus high dose calcium chloride. Neurological recovery was complete.
To study the effect of sulindac on colon cancer induction in mice.
The chemo-preventive action of 80 ppm sulindac fed during initiation and post-initiation and 100 ppm sulindac fed during progressive stages of induction of colon carcinogenesis in mice was investigated using 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique and PCNA immunohistochemical staining, we observed the apoptotic and proliferative cell density changes at different carcinogenic stages and the effect of sulindac on these two phenomena.
Dietary sulindac significantly inhibited the incidence of colonic neoplasmas in mice. Compared with the control group, feeding sulindac during initiation and post-initiation stages inhibited the incidence by 46.7-50.4%, and feeding sulindac during progressive stages inhibited the incidence by 41.1%. Animals that were fed sulindac showed less serious pathological changes than those that were fed the control diet (P<0.01, H = 33.35). There was no difference in the density of proliferating cells among those groups which were or were not fed sulindac. In the same period, feeding sulindac resulted in a higher density of apoptotic cells than feeding control diet.
Sulindac has an anti-carcinogenic function in mice. Its effect on preventing colon carcinogenesis is better than its effect on treating established tumors. By inducing apoptosis, sulindac inhibited the development of colon cancer and delayed canceration. Sulindac has no effect on proliferation. The anti-carcinogenic properties of sulindac are most effective in the moderate and severe stages of dysplasia and canceration.
The method of preparation and administration of "cow's urine" and the signs and symptoms of cow's urine poisoning have been described. Experimental investigations were carried out in mice to assess the toxicity ot this concoction. Effect of the preparation was compared with that of pure nicotine. The effect of each component used in preparing the concoction was also tested. Results of the experiments show that both "cow's urine" and nicotine cause excitement in low doses and cause convulsion and/or death in higher doses. Both also depress respiration. The role of "cow's urine" toxicity following administration to patients with convulsion and the possible aetiology of the neurological sequelae of "cow's urine" poisoning are discussed.
We report here an 83-year-old woman presenting with somnolence possibly induced by indapamide. She was diagnosed as having hypertension (180/110 mmHg), and 1 mg/day of indapamide was administered starting in October, 2002. Two months later, she complained of nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss and frequently fell down. On admission, she was hypotensive (90/54 mmHg). Neurologically, she was in a somnolent state (Japan Coma Scale 2-20), and showed brisk deep tendon reflexes of both upper limbs with bilateral Chaddock signs. Laboratory examination showed severe hyponatremia (115 mEq/l) and hypokalaemia (2.8 mEq/l). On brain MR imaging, there were no remarkable abnormalities, except for multiple lacunar infarctions. After the administration of indapamide was discontinued, her consciousness level and serum electrolytes immediately returned to normal levels. After a good effect for stroke prevention was reported, indapamide was widely prescribed in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) among the neurologists. We should keep in mind the risk of hyponatremia and hypokalaemia occurring in patients receiving indapamide, especially elderly women.
Cocaine intake growth is a well-known fact, and that involves the appearance of unknown or forgotten complications. We have wanted to make a checking of neurologic complications due to the intake of this drug, make a special point of the physiopathological mechanisms and stopping at those related to treatment. We also want to contribute with our experience with regard to these processes.
Sunfish were collected from coal ash effluent-receiving streams and Ohio River watershed reference sites to assess the effects of exposure to low-level selenium concentrations. Selenium, copper, and arsenic concentrations were statistically higher in tissue samples from exposed fish than in reference fish. Leukopenia, lymphocytosis, and neutropenia were evident in exposed fish and were indicative of metal exposure and effect. White blood cell counts and percent lymphocyte values were significantly correlated with liver selenium concentrations. Plasma protein levels were significantly lower in exposed fish than in fish from the Ohio River, indicating that exposed fish may have been nutritionally stressed. Condition factors for fish from the ash pond-receiving streams were the same as, or lower than, those of fish from the reference sites. There was no evidence that the growth rate of fish in the receiving streams differed from that of fish in the reference streams. Despite liver selenium concentrations which exceeded reported toxicity thresholds and evidence of significant hematological changes, there were no significant differences in fish condition factors, liver-somatic indices, or length-weight regressions related to selenium.
Many cases of male infertility are diagnosed as idiopathic, reflecting poor understanding of the molecular defects underlying the abnormality. As more gene mutations causing male infertility in mice become known, there are improving prospects that knowledge about the genetic aetiology of human male infertility can be expanded. Sycp3 encodes a component of the synaptonemal complex. A null mutation of Sycp3 in mice causes azoospermia with meiotic arrest. We tested the hypothesis that mutation of the human testis-specific SYCP3 is associated with human non-obstructive azoospermia.
Human SYCP3 was isolated on the basis of homology between mouse Sycp3 cDNA and human genome sequences at the aminoacid level. Tissue-specific expression of SYCP3 was analysed by PCR of human cDNA. Samples of DNA from 19 azoospermic patients with maturation arrest and 75 normal fertile control men were screened for mutations in the SYCP3 gene by sequence analysis of the gene. The functional significance of the mutations found was analysed by a protein interaction study of the wild-type and truncated SYCP3 proteins.
We identified in two patients a 1 bp deletion (643delA) that results in a premature stop codon and truncation of the C-terminal, coiled-coil-forming region of the SYCP3 protein. The mutant protein showed greatly reduced interaction with the wild-type protein in vitro and interfered with SYCP3 fibre formation in cultured cells.
We suggest that SYCP3 has an essential meiotic function in human spermatogenesis that is compromised by the mutant protein via dominant negative interference.
We explored the basis of the combinatorial chemopreventive effect of butyric acid (BA), nicotinamide (NA) and calcium glucarate (CAG) on mouse skin exposed to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). We studied the effects of topical application of DMBA in the presence or absence of BA, NA and CAG on the regulators of apoptosis. DMBA treatment suppressed Bax, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, release of cyt c, Apaf1, caspase-9, -3 mediated apoptosis. Downregulation of p21 and upregulation of Bcl-2, mut p53 were also observed in only DMBA treated mice. Simultaneous application of BA, NA and CAG induced a mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, characterized by a rise in the Bax, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, release of cyt c, upregulation of Apaf1 with down-stream activation of caspase-9, -3. Furthermore treatment with BA, NA and CAG demonstrated an upregulation of p21 and downregulation of Bcl-2, mut p53. But this effect was enhanced in the presence of all the three compounds together in combination. Chemoprevention by a combination of BA, NA and CAG by inducing the apoptosis, the natural cell death, suggest the importance of the potential combinational strategies capable of preventing skin tumor development.
A 54-year-old woman with transient global amnesia (TGA) was found to have digitalis-induced bradyarrhythmia with atrioventricular dissociation. The amnesia cleared only upon resolution of the arrhythmia. Cardiac arrhythmia has been postulated as a cause, but TGA in the setting of cardiac arrhythmia has not been documented previously. Cardiac arrhythmia should be excluded in patients with TGA, and TGA, a syndrome diagnosed on clinical grounds alone, must be recognized as one possible manifestation of treatable, potentially serious cardiac or cerebrovascular disease.
Excessive ethanol ingestion causes gastric mucosal damage through the inflammatory and oxidative processes. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of thalidomide on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in mice. The animals were pretreated with vehicle or thalidomide (30 or 60 mg/kg, orally), and one hour later, the gastric mucosal injury was induced by oral administration of acidified ethanol. The animals were euthanized one hour after ethanol ingestion, and gastric tissues were collected to biochemical analyzes. The gastric mucosal lesions were assessed by macroscopic and histopathological examinations. The results showed that treatment of mice with thalidomide prior to the administration of ethanol dose-dependently reduced the gastric ulcer index. Thalidomide pretreatment significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6], malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. In addition, thalidomide significantly inhibited ethanol-induced nitric oxide (NO) overproduction in gastric tissue. Histological observations showed that ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage was attenuated by thalidomide pretreatment. It seems that thalidomide as an anti-inflammatory agent may have a protective effect against alcohol-induced mucosal damage by inhibition of neutrophil infiltration and reducing the production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines in gastric tissue.
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a recognized acute complication of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) therapy in the treatment of malignant disease. More recently, lower dose, long-term cyclophosphamide therapy has been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. In 3 patients hemorrhagic cystitis developed after long-term cyclophosphamide therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Even in low dosage, this drug may cause hemorrhagic cystitis.
