To study the clinicopathological manifestations and target antigens of propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positive vasculitis.
Four hospitalized patients with PTU-induced ANCA positive vasculitis in recent two years were studied. Target antigens and antibody titers were investigated with ELISA using seven highly purified known ANCA antigens as solid phase ligands. The known antigens included proteinase 3 (PR3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), human leukocyte elastase (HLE), lactoferrin (LF), cathepsinG (CG), bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and azurocidin (AZU).
Four patients with Grave's disease, 2 female and 2 male with a mean age of 30 (11 approximately 57) years who had been treated with PTU for 7 approximately 60 months suffered from ANCA positive vasculitis. All the 4 patients had renal, lung, skin, joint, muscle and hematological involvement. Sera from all the 4 patients were ANCA positive and recognized MPO, LF and CG. Sera from 3 patients recognized HLE and AZU and 2 recognized PR3. None of the sera recognized BPI. The majority of the autoantibodies had high titers >/= 1:25 600. All the sera from 30 patients with Grave's disease and PTU treatment but without vasculitis were ANCA negative. All the 4 patients had pauci- immune glomerular lesions in renal biopsy; 2 had crescentic glomerulonephritis and the remaining 2 had minor glomerular abnormalities. All the 4 patients responded to withdrawal of propylthiouracil; 3 patients were treated with immunosuppressive agents. All the patients achieved clinical remission. However, one patient with crescentic glomerulonephritis was dialysis dependent. After withdrawal of PTU and administration of immunosuppressants, ANCA titres declined, but did not turn to negative in 1-6 months in most of the patients.
PTU can induce ANCA positive vasculitis. The autoantibodies were polyclonal and recognized multiple target antigens of neutrophil cytoplasm. Early withdrawal of PTU and administration of immunosuppressive agents might improve the prognosis.
Agnathia-otocephaly is a rare craniofacial malformation complex that is caused by de novo heterozygous and biallelic mutations in PRRX1 in two unrelated babies, respectively. We studied the PRRX1 gene in a non-consanguineous Indonesian female infant who was diagnosed prenatally with severe retrognathia (bilateral Pruzansky type III). Her older affected brother died shortly after birth and had agnathia-otocephaly. A c.266_269dupAAAA frameshift mutation in the poly A tract in PRRX1 was identified in the proband while her father only had an inframe duplication (c.267_269dupAAA) of the adenosine trinucleotide residue. Expression of both mutations in COS7 cells showed loss of function of the frame shift mutation only. Results of SNP genotyping coupled with recurrence of this novel mutation in this family are consistent with a paternally derived germline mosaicism rather than autosomal recessive inheritance as predicted by the family history. Severe retrognathia (bilateral Pruzansky III) and agnathia-otocephaly represent a spectrum of craniofacial malformations in this family.
Mechanisms involved in drug-induced cholestasis in humans remain poorly understood. Although cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) share similar immunosuppressive properties, only CsA is known to cause dose-dependent cholestasis. Here, we have investigated the mechanisms implicated in early cholestatic effects of CsA using the differentiated human HepaRG cell line. Inhibition of efflux and uptake of taurocholate was evidenced as early as 15 min and 1 h respectively after addition of 10μM CsA; it peaked at around 2 h and was reversible. These early effects were associated with generation of oxidative stress and deregulation of cPKC pathway. At higher CsA concentrations (≥50μM) alterations of efflux and uptake activities were enhanced and became irreversible, pericanalicular F-actin microfilaments were disorganized and bile canaliculi were constricted. These changes were associated with induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress that preceded generation of oxidative stress. Concentration-dependent changes were observed on total bile acid disposition, which were characterized by an increase and a decrease in culture medium and cells, respectively, after a 24-h treatment with CsA. Accordingly, genes encoding hepatobiliary transporters and bile acid synthesis enzymes were differently deregulated depending on CsA concentration. By contrast, FK506 induced limited effects only at 25-50μM and did not alter bile canaliculi. Our data demonstrate involvement of different concentration-dependent mechanisms in CsA-induced cholestasis and point out a critical role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the occurrence of the major cholestatic features.
Psychological factors may contribute to the aetiology and exacerbation of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), suggesting that the central nervous system may be an important site of dysfunction in IBS. Hormonal responses after a serotonergic challenge assess the functional integrity of central 5-hydroxytryptaminergic pathways and are diminished in depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether hormonal responses in IBS after a serotonergic challenge would be decreased, as in depression, or exaggerated, as have been reported in another functional gastrointestinal disorder, nonulcer dyspepsia.
Fourteen IBS patients, 16 healthy volunteers, and 9 patients with inflammatory bowel disease were given 30 mg d-fenfluramine, a selective stimulus to central 5-hydroxytryptaminergic pathways.
Plasma prolactin and cortisol concentrations during the following 5 h increased to a similar extent in all three subject groups, despite increased levels of anxiety and depression (as scored on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Beck Depression Inventory) in the IBS and inflammatory bowel disease patients compared with the healthy controls. Base-line cortisol concentration correlated with the magnitude of affective disorder.
In contrast to the alterations of central 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor sensitivity seen in depression and non-ulcer dyspepsia, central 5-hydroxytryptaminergic pathways function normally in IBS.
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation induce systemic inflammation where oxidative damage plays a key role in multiple organ failure. Because of the neutralization of LPS toxicity by sialic acid (SA), we determined its effect and mechanisms on repurified LPS (rLPS)-evoked acute renal failure. We assessed the effect of intravenous SA (10 mg/kg body weight) on rLPS-induced renal injury in female Wistar rats by evaluating blood and kidney reactive oxygen species (ROS) responses, renal and systemic hemodynamics, renal function, histopathology, and molecular mechanisms. SA can interact with rLPS through a high binding affinity. rLPS dose- and time-dependently reduced arterial blood pressure, renal microcirculation and blood flow, and increased vascular resistance in the rats. rLPS enhanced monocyte/macrophage (ED-1) infiltration and ROS production and impaired kidneys by triggering p-IRE1α/p-JNK/CHOP/GRP78/ATF4-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Bax/PARP-mediated apoptosis, Beclin-1/Atg5-Atg12/LC3-II-mediated autophagy, and caspase 1/IL-1β-mediated pyroptosis in the kidneys. SA treatment at 30 min, but not 60 min after rLPS stimulation, gp91 siRNA and protein kinase C-α (PKC) inhibitor efficiently rescued rLPS-induced acute renal failure via inhibition of TLR4/PKC/NADPH oxidase gp91-mediated ER stress, apoptosis, autophagy and pyroptosis in renal proximal tubular cells, and rat kidneys. In response to rLPS or IFNγ, the enhanced Atg5, FADD, LC3-II, and PARP expression can be inhibited by Atg5 siRNA. Albumin (10 mg/kg body weight) did not rescue rLPS-induced injury. In conclusion, early treatment (within 30 min) of SA attenuates rLPS-induced renal failure via the reduction in LPS toxicity and subsequently inhibiting rLPS-activated TLR4/PKC/gp91/ER stress/apoptosis/autophagy/pyroptosis signaling.
Men are at risk of becoming completely infertile due to innumerable environmental chemicals and pollutants. These xenobiotics, hence, should be tested for their potential adverse effects on male fertility. However, the testing load, a monumental challenge for employing conventional animal models, compels the pursuit of alternative models. Towards this direction, we show here that Drosophila melanogaster, an invertebrate, with its well characterized/conserved male reproductive processes/proteome, recapitulates male reproductive toxicity phenotypes observed in mammals when exposed to a known reproductive toxicant, dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Analogous to mammals, exposure to DBP reduced fertility, sperm counts, seminal proteins, increased oxidative modification/damage in reproductive tract proteins and altered the activity of a hormone receptor (estrogen related receptor) in Drosophila males. In addition, we show here that DBP is metabolized to monobutyl phthalate (MBP) in exposed Drosophila males and that MBP is more toxic than DBP, as observed in higher organisms. These findings suggest Drosophila as a potential alternative to traditional animal models for the prescreening of chemicals for their reproductive adversities and also to gain mechanistic insights into chemical-mediated endocrine disruption and male infertility.
Acetaminophen (APAP) pretreatment with a hepatotoxic dose (400 mg/kg) in mice results in resistance to a second, higher dose (600 mg/kg) of APAP (APAP autoprotection). Recent microarray work by our group showed a drastic induction of liver flavin containing monooxygenase-3 (Fmo3) mRNA expression in our mouse model of APAP autoprotection. The role of liver Fmo3, which detoxifies xenobiotics, in APAP autoprotection is unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the gene regulation and protein expression of liver Fmo3 during APAP hepatotoxicity. The functional consequences of Fmo3 induction were also investigated. Plasma and livers were collected from male C57BL/6J mice over a period of 72 h following a single dose of APAP (400 mg/kg) to measure Fmo3 mRNA and protein expression. Although Fmo3 mRNA levels increased significantly following APAP treatment, protein expression changed marginally. In contrast, both Fmo3 mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher in APAP autoprotected livers. Unlike male C57BL/6J mice, female mice have ∼80-times higher constitutive Fmo3 mRNA levels and are highly resistant to APAP hepatotoxicity. Coadministration of APAP with the FMO inhibitor methimazole rendered female mice susceptible to APAP hepatotoxicity, with no changes in susceptibility detected in male mice. Furthermore, a human hepatocyte cell line (HC-04) clone over-expressing human FMO3 showed enhanced resistance to APAP cytotoxicity. Taken together, these findings establish for the first time induction of Fmo3 protein expression and function by xenobiotic treatment. Our results also indicate that Fmo3 expression and function plays a role in protecting the liver from APAP-induced toxicity. Although the mechanism(s) of this protection remains to be elucidated, this work describes a novel protective function for this enzyme.
Exposure of mice to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) evokes pronounced hepatomegaly along with significant alterations in both the histological structure and immune status of the liver. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of this perfluorochemical on immune-mediated liver damage. In this connection, the influence of both sub-acute (10 days), moderate-dose (0.002% w/w=3±0.7mg/kg body weight/day) and short-term (28 days), low-dose (0.00005% w/w=70±2μg/kg body weight/day) dietary pretreatment with PFOA on the development of concanavalin A (Con A)-induced liver damage in mice was examined. With sub-acute, moderate, but not short-term, low-dose exposure, PFOA aggravated the acute liver damage caused by Con A, i.e., elevated serum levels of transaminases and led to more pronounced damage of hepatic tissue. This aggravation was associated with significantly enhanced hepatic level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), but unaltered hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Moreover, hepatic DNA fragmentation was not changed by sub-acute exposure to the moderate-dose. Our findings imply that exposure to PFOA may sensitize hepatic parenchymal cells to other toxicants that activate the hepatic immune system and thereby aggravate liver injury during acute inflammation.
Smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis is transiently increased at the onset of the regression of aortic hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with the angiotensin II AT(1) antagonist losartan. We postulated that losartan induction of SMC apoptosis contributes to suppression of neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. Losartan or placebo treatment was initiated two days before balloon injury in the SHR aorta. Compared with time-matched placebo, losartan decreased neointimal cross-sectional area at Days 5 and 10 after injury by 50% and 64% respectively, without affecting medial mass. At Day 10, losartan significantly decreased SMC number (by 56%) in the neointima, but not in the media. DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited at Day 5 but not at Day 10. Losartan significantly increased aortic DNA fragmentation by 2.6- and 4.1-fold, at Days 5 and 10, respectively. In situ labeling of SMC with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase revealed significant 61% and 68% increases in apoptotic SMC at Days 5 and 10 with losartan treatment, predominantly in the neointima. Thus, losartan suppressed neointima formation in part by the induction of SMC apoptosis, which may be dissociated from the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Therefore, losartan-induced SMC apoptosis may be a potential therapeutic approach to control occlusive vascular disorders.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, of which Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism are subtypes. Our goal is: 1) to determine whether a diagnostic model based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), brain regional thickness measurements, or brain regional volume measurements can distinguish Asperger syndrome from high-functioning autism; and 2) to compare the SNP, thickness, and volume-based diagnostic models.
Our study included 18 children with ASD: 13 subjects with high-functioning autism and 5 subjects with Asperger syndrome. For each child, we obtained 25 SNPs for 8 ASD-related genes; we also computed regional cortical thicknesses and volumes for 66 brain structures, based on structural magnetic resonance (MR) examination. To generate diagnostic models, we employed five machine-learning techniques: decision stump, alternating decision trees, multi-class alternating decision trees, logistic model trees, and support vector machines.
For SNP-based classification, three decision-tree-based models performed better than the other two machine-learning models. The performance metrics for three decision-tree-based models were similar: decision stump was modestly better than the other two methods, with accuracy = 90%, sensitivity = 0.95 and specificity = 0.75. All thickness and volume-based diagnostic models performed poorly. The SNP-based diagnostic models were superior to those based on thickness and volume. For SNP-based classification, rs878960 in GABRB3 (gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor, beta 3) was selected by all tree-based models.
Our analysis demonstrated that SNP-based classification was more accurate than morphometry-based classification in ASD subtype classification. Also, we found that one SNP--rs878960 in GABRB3--distinguishes Asperger syndrome from high-functioning autism.
1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU), a well characterized carcinogen, was used to induce adenocarcinomas in rat mammary gland. 150 days after the first injection of MNU, the animals were treated with DNA minigene vaccines encoding ras T cell epitopes together with the co-stimulatory molecule B7.1 (CD 80). Five injections with a biolistic device (gene gun) in monthly intervals significantly reduced the tumor burden. A therapeutic effect could be measured with both, DNA vaccines encoding ras epitopes and B7.1, as well as with a DNA vaccine expressing solely the B7.1 molecule thus indicating the potential of genetic vaccination for turnor treatment.
Dinitrotoluenes (DNTs) are byproducts of the explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT), and exist as a mixture of 2 to 6 isomers, with 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT being the most significant. The main route of human exposure at ammunition facilities is inhalation. The primary targets of DNTs toxicity are the hematopoietic system, cardiovascular system, nervous system and reproductive system. In factory workers, exposure to DNTs has been linked to many adverse health effects, including: cyanosis, vertigo, headache, metallic taste, dyspnea, weakness and lassitude, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms including pain or parasthesia in extremities, abdominal discomfort, tremors, paralysis, chest pain, and unconsciousness have been documented. An association between DNTs exposure and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinomas and subcutaneous tumors in rats, as well as renal tumors in mice, has been established. This research was therefore designed targeting the liver to assess the cellular and molecular responses of human liver carcinoma cells following exposure to 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay. Upon 48 hrs of exposure, LC50 values of 245 +/- 14.724 microg/mL, and 300 +/- 5.92 microg/mL were recorded for 2,6-DNT and 2,4-DNT respectively, indicating that both DNTs are moderately toxic, and 2,6-DNT is slightly more toxic to HepG2 cells than 2,4-DNT. A dose response relationship was recorded with respect to the cytotoxicity of both DNTs. Western blot analysis resulted in a significant expression (p<0.05) of the 70-kDa heat shock protein in 2,6-DNT-treated cells compared to the control cells and at the 200 microg/mL dose for 2,4-DNT. A statistically significant expression in c-fos was also observed at the 200 and 250 microg/mL treatment level for 2,4- and 2,6-DNT, respectively. However, no statistically significant expression of this protooncogene-related protein was observed at the doses of 0, 100, or 300 microg/mL or within the dose range of 0-200 microg/mL for 2,6-DNT. The 45-kDa growth arrest and damage protein was significantly expressed at the dose range of 200 - 250 microg/mL for 2,6-DNT and at the dose range of 200 - 400 microg/mL for 2,4-DNT. Expression of 153-kDa growth arrest and DNA damage protein was significant at the 100, 200, and 250 microg/mL doses for 2,6-DNT and at the 200 microg/mL dose for 2,4-DNT. Overall, these results indicate the potential of DNTs to induce cytotoxic, proteotoxic (HSP70), and genotoxic (GADD45/153) effects, as well as oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory reactions (c-fos).
A woman with cancer of the cervix had over a 4-week period three anesthetics with halogenated anesthetic agents, halothane, enflurane and halothane. 1 day after the third halothane anesthetic she developed fever and jaundice with biochemical evidence of severe hepatitis. Liver biopsy 10 days after the onset of jaundice showed features of acute hepatitis with bridging necrosis and piecemeal necrosis. A second biopsy after 10 months showed quiescent cirrhosis with residual piecemeal necrosis. The case is reported as a further example of halothane hepatitis evolving to cirrhosis of the liver.
The mortality and morbidity in congenital diaphragmatic hernia are mainly caused by pulmonary hypoplasia. To improve clinical results, further methods inducing lung growth may have to be used. The aim of this report was to evaluate the expression of insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I), estrogen receptor alpha, estrogen receptor beta, growth hormone receptor, and thioredoxin in a rat model of hypoplastic, hyperplastic, and normal fetal lungs to improve understanding of lung growth.
Hypoplastic diaphragmatic hernia lungs were created by giving nitrofen by gavage to pregnant rats on day 9.5. Hyperplastic lungs were achieved by intrauterine tracheal ligation of rat fetuses on day 19. All lungs were harvested on gestational day 21. Total nucleic acids were extracted by proteinase K digestion and extraction in phenol/chloroform. The total nucleic acids mixture was hybridized with radioactively labeled RNA probes, and the radioactivity of the hybrids was compared with the respective standard curve of known amounts of in vitro synthesized mRNA. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed for IGF-I.
The IGF-I mRNA was significantly (P < .01) higher in hyperplastic lungs compared with control and hypoplastic lungs. The latter 2 did not differ. No difference was found between the other mRNA levels in the study groups.
IGF-I is involved in the accelerated lung growth seen after intrauterine tracheal ligation.
The antiulcer effect of bisdemethoxycurcumin, a yellow pigment found mainly in rhizomes of Curcuma longa, was compared with curcumin in gastric ulcer model systems to validate its clinical application as a remedy for peptic ulcer. Western blot analysis of mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 activated with lipopolysaccharide showed that bisdemethoxycurcumin inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) production significantly but had no effect on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production, whereas curcumin showed stronger suppression of iNOS protein production and inhibited TNF-alpha protein production significantly. However, bisdemethoxycurcumin and curcumin possessed similar potency in scavenging nitric oxide generated from mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that both curcuminoids inhibited the induction of iNOS dose-dependently at the transcriptional level and curcumin also appeared to inhibit the induction of TNF-alpha at post-transcriptional level. In an animal model, intraduodenal administration of bisdemethoxycurcumin (5-80 mg/kg body wt.) showed a strong inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats whereas curcumin (5-20 mg/kg body wt.) showed a less inhibitory effect, with maximum potency at a dose of 20mg/kg body wt. Moreover, oral administration of bisdemethoxycurcumin at doses of 20-80 mg/kg body wt. twice daily for 10 days showed a significant curative efficacy in accelerating the healing of acetic acid-induced chronic gastric ulcer and promotion of mucosal regeneration in the ulcerated portion in a dose-related manner with potency equal to curcumin. In contrast, the curative potency of curcumin tended to decrease at doses over 160 mg/kg body wt./day. Western blot analysis in ulcerated gastric mucosa showed that bisdemethoxycurcumin dose-dependently reduced the increased protein expression level of iNOS but not TNF-alpha. These results indicated that bisdemethoxycurcumin directly accelerates gastric ulcer healing with potency equal to curcumin. Its antiulcer effect might be due to its properties of decreasing gastric acid secretion and enhancing the mucosal defensive mechanism through suppression of iNOS-mediated inflammation.
To investigate the pituitary-testicular function in nephrotic rats, a sequence of experiments was undertaken in adult male rats after a single dose of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). Endocrine modifications were evaluated chronologically throughout the experimental disease in order to determine the appearance of hormone alterations which lead to the axis dysfunction. Serum concentration of LH, FSH, androstenedione, total and free testosterone, estradiol as well as urine testosterone were measured by specific RIAs on days 3, 7 and 10 after treatment on nephrotic and control groups. Prolactin was also evaluated on day 10. Likewise, total weight of various androgen responsive tissues from both groups was recorded, and the number of androgen receptor (AR) binding sites were determined. To know the functional status of the hipophyseal-testicular unit, groups of nephrotic and control rats were stimulated with LHRH (300 ng/100 g b.w.) or with one or four doses of hCG (8 UI), respectively. Additionally, the relative in vitro biological activity of FSH from nephrotic and control rats before and after LHRH stimulus was determined. The results from the hormonal profile revealed clear endocrine disorders characterized by a progressive diminution of all serum hormones except prolactin and urine testosterone, which remained unmodified. The weight of the main androgen responsive tissues, the ventral prostate and the seminal vesicle, decreased parallelly to androgen diminution. The binding analysis of AR shows a significant elevation of the available androgen sites in all analyzed tissues except kidney and hypothalamus. The secretion of LH and FSH from nephrotic animals after LHRH administration was lower than that from intact animals at the registered times. Interestingly, the biological activity of FSH from nephrotic rats was not detectable at both, before and after LHRH administration. Testicular response to hCG stimuli, in terms of testosterone synthesis was not significantly different in the two groups analyzed with respect to the intact animals. By contrast, no response was observed in terms of estradiol production at either one or four doses of hCG. On the whole, the results presented herein allow us to conclude that experimental nephrosis has a harmful effect on the pituitary-testicular axis, and strongly suggests that the endocrine dysfunction is initiated at the hypophyseal level; even though a specific testicular damage is also present.
A comparative study on the effect of rolitetracycline (50 micrograms/g i.v.) on the hepatic content of triglycerides and the release of esterified fatty acids from the liver into the blood was performed in young and adult NMRI mice of both sexes. Rolitetracycline caused an accumulation of triglycerides only in the livers of adult animals, the effect being much more pronounced in females than in males. In agreement with this a very strong inhibition of lipid release from the liver and a significant decrease of the esterified fatty acids of the serum was produced only in adult females. The results suggest that the livers of young animals of both sexes are relatively resistant to the steatotic effect of rolitetracycline.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thromboembolism calls for an immediate substitution of the heparin with other potent anticoagulants, such as coumarin derivatives. The occurrence of this adverse effect in pregnancy poses an additional dilemma because the use of coumarin derivatives is not acceptable during pregnancy, while other medications may not be as effective. In a pregnant patient treated with mucous sodium heparin for deep vein thrombosis, recurrent heparin-induced thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurred. Replacing the heparin with a different brand of the same drug resulted in reversal of the DIC and in clinical improvement. If severe heparin-induced thrombosis occurs in a patient in whom anticoagulation with other drugs is contraindicated, substituting one brand of heparin for another could be of value.
The VIOXX Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research (VIGOR) trial showed a 53% decrease in the risk of upper gastrointestinal toxicity and a fivefold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction for rofecoxib (a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor) compared with naproxen. We examined the effects of these competing adverse events on life expectancy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
We used decision analysis to compare the life expectancy of a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis patients taking naproxen versus a similar cohort taking rofecoxib, using data from the VIGOR trial. We incorporated the competing risks of upper gastrointestinal toxicity and myocardial infarction, as well as their long-term health consequences, on the basis of population-based studies.
For 58-year-old women with rheumatoid arthritis (i.e., typical of participants in the VIGOR trial), naproxen was associated with a longer life expectancy than was rofecoxib (difference = 4.4 months). This difference was larger among 58-year-old men (7.8 months). The probability that naproxen is associated with a longer life expectancy than rofecoxib among 58-year-old patients was 92% for women and 98% for men. Life expectancy became the same between the two treatments when the risk of upper gastrointestinal toxicity was 70% higher or the risk of myocardial infarction was 40% lower than that of the base case among women, and when the risk of upper gastrointestinal toxicity was 4.4-fold higher or the risk of myocardial infarction was 70% lower among men.
Our analysis suggests that the competing risks of upper gastrointestinal toxicity and myocardial infarction shown in the VIGOR trial would project a longer life expectancy with naproxen than rofecoxib among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, except in those at low risk of myocardial infarction or at high risk of upper gastrointestinal toxicity.
Two small neonates, one with hypoplastic right heart syndrome, and the other with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia, were treated with intravenous prostaglandin E1 (Prostyn VR, Upjohn, Kalamazoo, Michigan) for 96 and 33 days, respectively. They developed limited cortical hyperostosis, but marked soft tissue swellings in all extremities. The changes were noted after PGE1 treatment for four weeks and one week, respectively. A skin biopsy was performed in one patient and revealed edematous changes and arteriolar wall abnormalities. We add this peripheral hard edema to the list of complications of PGE1 therapy, and speculate as to its pathophysiology.
The occurrence of anuria and stupor in a patient treated with acyclovir afforded the opportunity to discuss the renal and neurological toxicity of this drug. Acute renal insufficiency by crystallization of acyclovir and intratubular obstruction is a not infrequent side effect. The risk depends on the dose, the administration mode, the patient's state of hydration and preexisting renal failure. The evolution is typified by a rapid onset (after 24-48 h) and a prompt recovery after ending the treatment. The demonstration in urinalysis of crystals within leukocytes helps to establish the diagnosis. Neurological involvement can vary from confusion to coma. The cerebrospinal fluid is normal and the electroencephalogram shows diffuse slowing. A favorable outcome after ending treatment is the rule. Awareness of the risk factors associated with renal and neurological toxicity should lead to a reduction of its frequency.
Methotrexate causes several biochemical changes that impact the nervous system. The neurotoxicity usually affects the cerebral white matter, causing a leukoencephalopathy that can be chronic and progressive with cognitive decline. A 15-year-old male developed olfactory seizures and behavioral abnormalities (hypersexuality, placidity, and memory disturbances) compatible with partial Klüver-Bucy syndrome after treatment for central nervous system leukemia with intraventricular methotrexate. A magnetic resonance imaging study revealed evidence of white matter disease affecting both temporal lobes. A brain biopsy revealed a necrotizing encephalopathy compatible with methotrexate-related white matter injury. It may be prudent to verify normal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics before the administration of intraventricular methotrexate in children with a history of central nervous system leukemia.
Primary effusion lymphomas (PELs) are a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that are resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. PELs manifest constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and inhibition of NF-kappaB induces apoptosis of PELs and sensitizes to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced death. Bortezomib (PS-341), a peptidyl boronic acid inhibitor of the proteasome, is a potent agent against a wide range of hematologic malignancies and has been shown to inhibit NF-kappaB. Thus, we examined the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib alone and in combination with various drugs. Bortezomib potently inhibited NF-kappaB in PEL cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, bortezomib inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of PEL cell lines (IC(50) values of 3.4-5.0 nM). Results of drug interactions between bortezomib and chemotherapy (doxorubicin and Taxol) were schedule-dependent: synergistic interactions were generally observed when PEL cells were pretreated with bortezomib prior to chemotherapy, whereas additive or even antagonistic interactions occurred with chemotherapy pretreatment or simultaneous treatment with bortezomib and chemotherapy. Most schedules of bortezomib and dexamethasone were synergistic, although pretreatment with dexamethasone resulted in additive interactions. Effects of combinations of bortezomib and TRAIL were generally additive. Thus, bortezomib represents a promising potential therapy for the treatment of PEL.
The natural history of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is not well described. This study investigated in the dog renal functional and electrolyte abnormalities during and for 20 days following a 10-day course of low-dose gentamicin (7 mg/kg/day), high-dose gentamicin (30 mg/kg/day), and netilmicin (30 mg/kg/day). Renal histology was examined at the end of the study. Renal functional abnormalities occurred only in animals receiving high-dose gentamicin. A fall in maximal urinary osmolality (1579 +/- 347 mOsm/kg/H2O to 450 +/- 118, p less than 0.05) was followed by renal glycosuria and a fall in GFR (66.9 +/- 11.9 ml/min to 21.3 +/- 8.6, p less than 0.05). These three functional indices had recovered by day 30 in the survivors. Plasma potassium fell in animals receiving high-dose gentamicin (3.8 +/- 0.02 mEq/L to 3.3 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.05) and reached the lowest values (2.7 and 2.9 mEq/L) just prior to death in two animals dying in uremia. Netilmicin also caused a significant fall in plasma potassium (4.3 +/- 0.1 mEq/L to 3.9 +/- 0.1, p less than 0.05). Hypocalcemia (10.0 +/- 1.3 mg/dl to 7.8 +/- 1.4, p less than 0.05) but not hypomagnesemia developed following high-dose gentamicin. Peak serum aminoglycoside levels after high-dose gentamicin and netilmicin were comparable, but trough levels rose only in high-dose gentamicin animals and paralleled the fall in GFR. Light microscopy of the kidney 3 weeks after high-dose gentamicin demonstrated no proximal tubular necrosis but extensive focal tubulointerstitial nephritis, especially in the juxtamedullary cortex. Similar but less extensive derangements were noted in animals receiving low-dose gentamicin, despite the absence of functional abnormalities. Minor histological abnormalities were noted in animals receiving netilmicin. To summarize: 1) major renal functional and electrolyte abnormalities developed only following high-dose gentamicin and included impaired urinary concentration, glycosuria, reduced GFR, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia (except for a fall in plasma potassium, similar doses of netilmicin were not nephrotoxic); (2) tubulointerstitial nephritis, particularly in the juxtamedullary cortex, occurred with low-dose gentamicin as well as high-dose gentamicin and may be a factor in delayed or incomplete recovery from gentamicin nephrotoxicity; (3) in this model, netilmicin at comparable doses was substantially less nephrotoxic than gentamicin; (4) renal postassium wasting may be a heretofore unrecognized consequence of aminoglycoside administration.
Previous studies have shown that cocaine users have higher levels of impulsivity and impaired decision making; however, few have examined these factors as predictors of treatment success. We obtained baseline neurocognitive measures from 75 cocaine-dependent individuals participating in a 12-week clinical trial targeting impulsivity with behavioral therapies and pharmacotherapy. Participants treated with citalopram had higher cocaine abstinence rates compared to placebo-treated participants. The aim of this secondary analysis study was to determine whether profiles of performance on neurocognitive measures administered at baseline discriminated among patients who achieved abstinence and those who did not. Participants completed the Immediate and Delayed Memory Task, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11, and Iowa Gambling Task. Profile analysis results showed different patterns of performance on these baseline measures as a function of outcome. Compared with non-abstinent participants, abstinent participants had higher scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 Non-Planning subscale and better performance on the Iowa Gambling Task. Profile differences for the two outcome groups did not vary as a function of treatment condition. Results suggest that cocaine-dependent patients entering treatment with higher impulsivity and less impaired decision-making abilities may respond favorably to targeted behavioral interventions. Neurocognitive profiles may be useful in understanding population heterogeneity and predicting differential outcomes in subgroups of cocaine abusers.
The development of joint attention skills is a major milestone of infancy. Recent research suggests that the development of these skills may be affected by disorganized (D) attachment. This hypothesis was examined in a longitudinal study of attachment and joint attention skill development in a sample of infants at risk for developmental-behavioral morbidity. The results revealed that toddlers with D classifications initiated joint attention with an experimenter significantly less often than did secure, or even other insecure, toddlers. However, no group differences in the capacity to respond to the joint attention bids of others were observed in this study. These data suggest that a disturbance in the tendency to initiate episodes of joint attention with others may be indicative of early social-cognitive and social-emotional disturbance among infants affected by disorganized attachment status. Theory and research is reviewed to suggest that an early impairment in joint attention facility may make a significant contribution to risk for negative cognitive and emotional outcomes among these infants.
Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug with unique pharmacological and therapeutic properties. Unlike the typical antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, clozapine does not cause extrapyramidal side effects; however, weight gain, dyslipidemia, and type II diabetes are commonly associated with the use of this drug in subjects with schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to profile gene expression in the rat striatum following clozapine treatment. Chronic treatment with clozapine revealed upregulation of several genes including the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) gene by over 200% in the rat striatum. The cDNA array results for the GIP gene were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR as well as by radioimmunoassay. Expression of the GIP gene in the central nervous system is consistent with the results of retinal GIP gene expression as reported by other investigators. Taken together, these findings implicate the possible role of GIP as a neuromodulator in the central nervous system. GIP is an insulinotropic agent with stimulatory effects on insulin synthesis and release from the pancreas. However, changes in brain GIP levels are most likely unrelated to the metabolic adverse effects (dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, weight gain) associated with clozapine treatment. Therefore, we also measured GIP gene expression in the K-cell-rich regions, duodenum and jejunum (small intestine), and plasma GIP levels using radioimmunoassay following chronic treatment with clozapine. GIP mRNA levels in the small intestine and the plasma GIP at the protein level were significantly elevated in clozapine-treated subjects. Furthermore, as observed in humans, chronic clozapine treatment also caused weight gain, and increased levels of insulin, triglycerides and leptin in the plasma. These results suggest that adverse metabolic effects associated with clozapine treatment may be related to its ability to increase intestinal gene expression for GIP.
