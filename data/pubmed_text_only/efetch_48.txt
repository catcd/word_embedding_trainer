Following a myocardial infarction, patients are usually started on long term antiplatelet therapy with aspirin in a dose of 80-150 mg/day. However, there are no quick and easy methods to assess the efficacy of the antiplatelet activity of aspirin.
We studied 60 consecutive patients (men, < 40 years of age) 8-10 weeks after they had had acute myocardial infarction. These patients were receiving 100 mg aspirin daily orally with or without b-blockers. We measured P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding by flowcytometry at least 3 times over a period of 2 years in all the patients. We also studied 100 age- and sex-matched controls.
Of the 60 patients, 30 (50%) showed both increased P-selectin and fibrinogen binding by platelets, suggesting platelet activation. Fourteen other patients had increased fibrinogen binding but normal P-selectin expression. Sixteen patients and all the controls had normal results of both tests.
Our data show evidence of platelet activation in at least 50% of patients receiving 100 mg of aspirin daily. Flowcytometry for P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding to platelets can be used to monitor antiplatelet therapy with aspirin following acute myocardial infarction.
Adverse effects involving one or more organ systems occurred in 38 of 165 patients with various types of glaucoma when timolol was added to their glaucoma therapy. It was necessary to discontinue timolol because of these side effects in 15 (9%) of the patients. Double-masked studies will be necessary to clarify the relationship of these adverse effects to the use of timolol.
Cardiac transplant arteriosclerosis or cardiac allograft vasculopathy remains the leading cause of graft failure and patient death in heart transplant recipients. Endothelial cell injury is crucial in the development of human atherosclerosis and may play a role in allograft vasculopathy. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is known to protect endothelial cells from damage by oxidants and toxins. However, the contribution of human GST A4-4 (hGSTA4-4) to vascular cell injury and consequent transplant arteriosclerosis is unknown.
A recombinant adenoviral vector containing hGSTA4-4 gene was constructed and delivered to vascular endothelial cells in an in vivo rabbit carotid artery transplant model. Forty-five days after transplantation, allografts were harvested (n=28). Blood flow was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, grafts were analyzed by histology, morphometry, immunostaining, and western blot.
The severity of arteriosclerosis in hGSTA4-4 transduced allografts was compared with control by measuring degree of stenosis by neointima. Decrease in blood flow in hGSTA4-4 transduced allografts was significantly less than control allografts, which also developed greater intimal thickening and stenosis than hGSTA4-4 transduced allografts in the proximal and distal regions of the graft. Leukocyte and macrophage infiltration was reduced in hGSTA4-4 transduced carotid arteries.
Our data indicate that hGSTA4-4 overexpression protects the integrity of vessel wall from oxidative injury, and attenuates transplant arteriosclerosis.
The effect of intravenous captopril was studied in 24 white patients who had moderate to severe hypertension. Patients received incremental doses of 1 to 10 mg delivered at 10 min intervals over 50 to 80 min. Blood pressure (BP) was lowered within 5 to 10 min after the initial dose was administered and continued to decline, reaching a maximum response after 20 min (2 to 4 mg). At this time group mean BP fell from 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 1 to 166 +/- 3/97 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Additional dose increments to an average cumulative dose of 40 mg did not increase the initial effect. No adverse side effects or symptomatic hypotension occurred in any subject. There was a significant correlation between diastolic BP decreases observed in response to intravenous captopril and subsequent long-term oral captopril therapy. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide increased the proportion of patients reaching normotension. We conclude that small intravenous bolus injections of captopril appear to be effective rapidly and are well tolerated in moderate to severe essential hypertension. Short-term intravenous administration seems to predict the response to chronic oral captopril therapy.
The analgesic antrafenine forms 1-m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (mCF3PP) during its biotransformation in the rat and mouse. At least 14 and 3% of an antrafenine dose (25 mg kg-1 p.o.) reaches the systemic circulation as mCF3PP in the mouse and rat respectively. The metabolite easily enters the brain, reaching concentrations several times those in body fluids. This, together with the fact that mCF3PP is known to produce several pharmacological effects compatible with a stimulatory action on 5-hydroxytryptamine postsynaptic receptors, suggests that this metabolite may contribute to the parent drug's pharmacological effects.
In massive hemorrhage from acute gastric mucosal lesions, it is occasionally difficult to control the bleeding with nonsurgical therapy. We used the somatostatin analog, octreotide, which suppresses gastric and pancreatic function, to treat severe hemorrhagic erosive gastritis in a patient with acute pancreatitis. A 22-year-old man presented with epigastralgia and melena. Blood levels of pancreatitis markers were elevated. Computed tomography revealed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas, without fluid collection around the organ. An endoscopic examination showed extensive hemorrhagic erosions over almost the whole gastric mucosa. We diagnosed extensive hemorrhagic erosive gastritis with acute pancreatitis. A protease inhibitor (nafamostat mesilate 50 mg/day) and an H(2) receptor antagonist (famotidine 40 mg/day) were administered by injection for 6 days; the patient's serum and urine amylase levels fell, but the gastric erosions with hemorrhage were not attenuated. Octreotide was given subcutaneously, at a daily dose of 100 microg for 5 days, without famotidine administration. His melena disappeared, and the gastric erosions were markedly decreased. Administration of the somatostatin analog, octreotide, proved to be effective treatment in a patient with severe hemorrhagic erosive gastritis associated with acute pancreatitis.
There is a need for effective treatments of ischemic wounds. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that systemic administration of isoniazid or niacin can enhance wound healing in ischemic as well as nonischemic tissues.
One 8-mm, full-thickness wound was made in a standardized, ischemic skin flap and 1 in adjacent nonischemic skin on the back of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Starting just after wounding, twice-daily intraperitoneal isoniazid (10 mg/kg b.i.d.), xanthinol nicotinate (30 mg/kg), or saline (control) were given for 14 days. Wound-healing was monitored by planimetry and oxygen tension in periphery of the wound using a microcatheter probe. Cellular proliferation in granulation tissue was assessed by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The angiogenic activity of isoniazid and niacin was assessed using in vitro and ex vivo models.
Although wound ischemia was evident by decreased oxygen tension (26 +/- 10 mmHg; n = 9) compared with the adjacent nonischemic wounds (51 +/- 8 mmHg; n = 8), neither compound significantly influenced intracutaneous oxygen tension. Isoniazid (P < .0001), but not niacin, promoted ischemic wound-healing even though both compounds increased proliferation measured on day 14 (P < .01). In normal wounds, the cumulative change in relative wound area over 14 days was increased by niacin (P = .002), but not by isoniazid, although both niacin (P = .011) and isoniazid (P = .036) increased cellular proliferation. Neither isoniazid nor niacin showed activity in either an endothelial tube formation assay or organotypic angiogenic assay under normoxic conditions.
Isoniazid was capable of stimulating wound-healing in ischemic tissue to the level of nonischemic wounds and might offer a novel treatment option for wounds associated with arterial insufficiency. Although active in normal wounds, niacin did not promote ischemic wound-healing.
Cholesterol lowering therapy may offset the development of coronary atherosclerosis, and the resulting reduction in coronary ischemia may be observed in the electrocardiogram (ECG).
A total of 2039 Japanese adults with hypercholesterolemia were divided into two groups (receiving 10-20 mg pravastatin daily or a normal diet) and were followed up for 5 years. ECG studies were performed at entry and every year during the follow-up period. The occurrence of myocardial infarction and the appearance or worsening of ischemic ST changes were assessed in terms of effects on the ECG.
Of the 2039 patients registered, 827 were excluded from the study for various reasons. Consequently, a total of 1212 patients were analyzed. There was a lower degree of worsening in the pravastatin group (n=757) than in the normal diet group (n=455) in the primary prevention cohort [11 (1.8%) vs. 16 (4.3%), respectively, P=0.031]. On the other hand, there was no difference in the frequency of worsening between the two groups in the secondary prevention cohort [7 (4.4%) in the pravastatin group vs. 4 (4.9%) in the diet group, P=0.25]. Event-free survival was better in the pravastatin group than in the normal diet group in the primary prevention cohort (P=0.011), but there was no difference between the two groups in the secondary prevention cohort.
These results suggest that pravastatin may reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease and that this effect may be predominantly observed in patients with early atheromatous lesions.
Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic drug frequently used in children. Although VPA can cause a variety of laboratory abnormalities affecting haemostasis, controversy exists about the clinical relevance of such haematological abnormalities. We report on 4 children with severe bleeding complications while on VPA therapy; two presented with intracranial bleeding, while two suffered from severe bleeding postoperatively. Diagnostic and therapeutic measures are discussed that help to avoid severe bleeding complications in children with VPA treatment.
Acetaminophen (AAP), the analgesic hepatotoxicant, is a powerful inducer of oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic oncogene bcl-XL, and the pro-apoptotic oncogene p53 are two key regulators of cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis subsequent to DNA damage in vitro and in vivo. This study investigated the effect of AAP on the expression of these oncogenes and whether agents that modulate DNA fragmentation (chlorpromazine, CPZ) and DNA repair through poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity (4-AB: 4-aminobenzamide) can protect against AAP-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation, and/or by altering the expression of bcl-XL and p53. In addition, the protective effect of supplemental nicotinamide (NICO), known to be depleted in cells with high PARP activity during DNA repair, is similarly evaluated. Male ICR mice (3 months old) were administered vehicle alone; nontoxic doses of 4-AB (400 mg/kg, ip), NICO (250 mg/kg, ip) or CPZ (25 mg/kg, ip), hepatotoxic dose of AAP alone (500 mg/kg, ip), or AAP plus one of the protective agents 1 h later. All animals were sacrificed 24 h following AAP administration. Serum alanine aminotransferase activity (ALT), hepatic histopathology and lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and expression of bcl-XL and p53 (western blot analysis) were compared in various groups. All of the three agents significantly prevented AAP-induced liver injury, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths, 4-AB being the most effective and NICO the least. Compared to control, there was a considerable decrease in bcl-XL expression, and an increase in p53 expression in AAP-exposed livers. The effect of AAP on bcl-XL was antagonized and that on p53 was synergized by the PARP-modulator 4-AB as well as NICO, whereas the endonuclease inhibitor CPZ was without effect on either bcl-XL or p53 expression. These results suggest that the hepatotoxic effect of AAP involves multiple mechanisms including oxidative stress, upregulation of endonuclease (or caspase-activated DNAse) and alteration of pro- and anti-apoptotic oncogenes. The observed antagonism of AAP-induced hepatocellular apoptosis and/or necrosis by modulators of multiple processes including DNA repair suggests the likelihood that a more effective therapy against AAP intoxication should involve a combination of antidotes.
The effect of various levels of polyunsaturated fat (corn oil) and saturated fat (lard) fed during the initiation stage of colon carcinogenesis was studied in male F344 rats. The animals were fed the diets containing 5, 13.6, and 23.5% corn oil or lard 2 weeks before, during, and until 1 week after sc injection of 15 mg azoxymethane [(AOM) CAS: 25843-45-2]/kg body weight, once weekly for 2 weeks (designated as initiation). One week after AOM treatment, groups of animals were transferred to their respective 5% corn oil or lard diets. Additional groups consuming 5% corn oil or lard were transferred to 23.5% corn oil or lard, respectively (post-initiation stage). All animals were fed these diets until the termination of the experiment. Fecal bile acids and colonic mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity were measured in vehicle-treated animals fed the experimental diets for 14 weeks. Body weights and intakes of total calories, protein, nonnutritive fiber, and micronutrients were comparable among the various dietary groups. The animals fed the 23.5% corn oil diet during the postinitiation stage had a higher incidence of colon tumors than did those fed the 5% corn oil diet, whereas feeding of 23.5 and 13.6% corn oil diets during the initiation stage had no effect. In contrast, animals fed the 23.5 and 13.6% lard diet during the initiation stage and 23.5% lard diet during the postinitiation stage developed more colon adenocarcinomas than did those fed the 5% lard diet. The excretion of fecal deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and 12-ketolithocholic acid and the activity of colonic mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity were higher in animals fed the 23.5% corn oil or lard diet during the postinitiation compared to the levels in animals fed the 5% corn oil or lard diet.
Fluoroquinolones have been associated with tendinopathies. The authors present three cases of Achilles tendinopathy in which the patients' symptoms were preceded by treatment for unrelated bacterial infections with ciprofloxacin. Although the exact mechanism of the relationship is not understood, those who engage in sports or exercise should be advised of the risk of quinolone-induced tendinopathy.
The parenteral form of phenytoin is the most commonly used antiepileptic agent during the perioperative period in neurosurgery clinics. We report observations in a 52-year-old male patient with hypoalbuminemia and phenytoin intoxicity following 1 day preoperative administration and a 7-day postoperative intravenous administration of the drug with no modification of the oral dose. This report emphasizes the need for careful surveillance of phenytoin-induced toxicity during parenteral therapy, especially in debilitated patients.
Two patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia previously treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), were treated with a new synthetic retinoid, Am-80. In both patients pancytopenia gradually resolved without an increase in leukaemic cells, and differentiation of leukaemic cells was observed morphologically in bone marrow. Without the use of anti-leukaemic agents, both cases achieved complete remission (CR) on days 52 and 38 of treatment, respectively. On the day of CR, PML gene rearrangement and the t(15;17) translocation disappeared, though PML-RAR alpha chimaeric messenger RNA was still detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Both patients then received conventional chemotherapy for consolidation of CR. These clinical experiences suggest that Am-80 may be an active agent for APL patients who have relapsed from ATRA-induced remission.
The mechanism of testosterone inducing the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in protecting against thrombosis is unknown. We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the induction by observing, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), a major cell signaling system. The level of testosterone regulating several signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK, was measured by western blot in HUVECs. ELISA and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR were used to analyze TFPI expression after blocking ERK1/2 (with PD98059) or JNK (with SP600125) pathway in HUVECs. Testosterone-induced a rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK in HUVECs, which could not be inhibited by androgen receptor antagonist flutamide. Blocking ERK1/2 or JNK pathway could significantly impair testosterone-induced TFPI at both translational and transcriptional levels in HUVECs. Testosterone at a physiological concentration may help to prevent thrombosis development by stimulating TFPI expression in HUVECs, partly through the ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK pathway.
Airway instillation into rats of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), the half molecule of sulfur mustard compound, results in acute lung injury, as measured by the leak of plasma albumin into the lung. Morphologically, early changes in the lung include alveolar hemorrhage and fibrin deposition and the influx of neutrophils. Following lung contact with CEES, progressive accumulation of collagen occurred in the lung, followed by parenchymal collapse. The co-instillation with CEES of liposomes containing pegylated (PEG)-catalase (CAT), PEG-superoxide dismutase (SOD), or the combination, greatly attenuated the development of lung injury. Likewise, the co-instillation of liposomes containing the reducing agents, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), glutathione (GSH), or resveratrol (RES), significantly reduced acute lung injury. The combination of complement depletion and airway instillation of liposomes containing anti-oxidant compounds maximally attenuated CEES-induced lung injury by nearly 80%. Delayed airway instillation of anti-oxidant-containing liposomes (containing NAC or GSH, or the combination) significantly diminished lung injury even when instillation was delayed as long as 1 h after lung exposure to CEES. These data indicate that CEES-induced injury of rat lungs can be substantially diminished by the presence of reducing agents or anti-oxidant enzymes delivered via liposomes.
Olmesartan medoxomil is a new angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Olmesartan medoxomil is a pro-drug that is converted to the active metabolite olmesartan. Olmesartan does not undergo further metabolism and does not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes. Olmesartan is a potent ARB with high selectivity for the type 1 (AT(1)) receptor subtype and shows insurmountable antagonism against the AT(1) receptor in vascular tissues. This antagonistic mode, which could be attributed to tight binding of this drug to the receptor, would underlie the potent and persistent action of olmesartan medoxomil in vivo. In fact, oral administration of olmesartan medoxomil produces a potent and long-lasting antihypertensive action without inducing tachycardia. The preventive effects of olmesartan medoxomil on end-organ damage in the kidney, heart, and blood vessels have been demonstrated in various animal models. In clinical studies, olmesartan medoxomil is shown to be well tolerated and have an excellent safety profile that is comparable to that of placebo. Head-to-head comparisons with other ARBs (losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, and candesartan cilexetil) conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that olmesartan medoxomil is superior to these other ARBs in lowering blood pressure. These facts suggest that olmesartan medoxomil would be beneficial for the treatment of hypertension and other end-organ diseases.
The hypolipidemic agent nafenopin, (NF), has been reported to be carcinogenic to rat liver. To determine whether nafenopin exerts a promoting or syncarcinogenic effect in rat liver, its effect on liver carcinogenesis induced by N-2-fluorenylacetamide (FAA) was studied. In two separate experiments, male F344 rats were fed 0.02% FAA for either 10 or 8 weeks to induce preneoplastic liver lesions. Following a recovery period of 1 week, rats were given 0.01 or 0.02% NF in the diet for 23 weeks in one experiment and 0.05 or 0.1% for 24 weeks in the other. The final incidence of neoplasms, and their numbers, size distribution, and degrees of differentiation were not significantly different in groups given NF after FAA compared to those maintained on a basal diet after FAA. In the group treated with the highest dose level of NF following FAA, however, there was a decrease in the number of grossly visible small neoplasms. In contrast, the liver neoplasm promoter phenobarbital increased the multiplicity, although not the incidence, of liver neoplasms when given after FAA. Thus, four different dose levels of NF showed no promoting or syncarcinogenic effect on FAA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
Hallucinations caused by adverse reactions to medication are not uncommon and a wide variety of drugs may be involved. We present a case of hallucinations caused by therapeutic doses of oral clarithromycin (500 mg b.i.d).
A 32-year-old woman attended the Emergency Department of the hospital with severe visual hallucinations together with marked anxiety and nervousness following the second dose of clarithromycin, which was the only medication she was taking. The antibiotic was identified as the possible cause of the clinical manifestations and was stopped immediately. The patient did not require hospitalization and was discharged a few hours later with no signs of neurological disturbances. Clarithromycin was substituted by amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (500/125 mg) t.i.d.
The temporal relationship between commencement of antibiotic therapy and the appearance of hallucinations, together with the fact that the symptoms disappeared once the antibiotic was suspended, support a causal relationship between clarithromycin and the hallucinations. Further support for a causal relationship was obtained by application of Naranjo's algorithm which gave a likelihood level for causality of PROBABLE.
Three hundred and eight-four cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix accessioned in the Registry as of December 31, 1978, have been analyzed. The annual incidence of these tumors has been found to correspond closely to the estimated usage of diethylstilbestrol (DES) for pregnancy support in the United States. The annual incidence of the DES-associated cases appears to have dropped in the United States in the past 2 years in comparison to 1973 to 1975. The risk of tumor development appears to be higher in young women exposed to DES early in intrauterine life than in those exposed later. The carcinomas are rare before the age of 14 years and an irregular peak in the age-incidence curve appears between 17 and 21 years followed by a decline. The 5-year survival rate is better for women over the age of 19 years than for younger patients, and a higher frequency oral contraceptive usage did not appear to influence the behavior of the tumor and the improved survival in those using this medication appears to be related to greater medical surveillance.
Quazepam, a recently introduced long-half-life benzodiazepine, seems to have a more specific hypnotic activity and a physiological mechanism of action. The present study evaluated clinical efficacy and eventually rebound symptoms after the treatment with quazepam and triazolam. Sixty-five patients, affected by sleep disorders, were entered into the study. Patients were treated with a placebo for four days and, if no amelioration of insomnia was observed, they were allocated randomly to receive 15 mg of quazepam (32 patients) or 0.5 mg triazolam (33 patients) for eight weeks and finally the placebo for another week. The sleep quality, the sleep efficacy, the unwanted effects and the rebound effects had been assessed by specific evaluation scales. Both of the drugs showed a hypnogenic efficacy but patients treated with quazepam had significantly less night awakenings; at the treatment's interruption, only the patients treated with triazolam had longer awakenings and rebound symptoms. In conclusion, quazepam seems to have a good hypnotic effect without inducing rebound effects. On the contrary, triazolam turned out to be just a hypnoinducent drug with higher risks of rebound effects after withdrawal.
1. The effect of the convulsant agents pentetrazole, picrotoxin, bicuculline, strychnine and isoniazid on the central level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the activity of the enzymes glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA-alpha-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GABA-T) from mice brain was studied in vivo and vitro. In vivo, convulsant doses of picrotoxin and isoniazid lowered the level of GABA and the activity of GAD, whereas strychnine and bicuculline had no such effect. Pentetrazole inhibited GAD, but did not alter the GABA content. In vitro, all convulsants, except bicuculline, inhibited the activity of GAD; however, the concentrations of strychnine were far beyond the range that is reached in vivo by convulsant doses. Only isoniazid inhibited the activity of GABA-T in vivo as well as in vitro. 2. Phenobarbital, ethosuximide and trimethadione were about equally active in preventing convulsions induced by strychnine and picrotoxin, whereas diazepam was 9 times, and sodium valproate 3.5 times more active against convulsions elicited by picrotoxin. Phenytoin up to 100 mg/kg was ineffective against all chemoconvulsants. 3. Diazepam, sodium valproate, ethosuximide and trimethadione antagonized the inhibition of GAD and the decrease in GABA concentrations caused by isoniazid. Phenobarbital and phenytoin prevented the decrease of GABA but did not reverse the inhibition of GAD. 4. The results suggest a role played by the transmitter pool of GABA in the convulsant action of chemoconvulsants and in the anticonvulsant effect of antiepileptics clinically used in petit mal epilepsy.
As Parkinson's disease appears to be a multifactoral disorder, the use of animal models to investigate combined effects of genetic and environmental risk factors are of great importance especially in the context of aging which is the single major risk factor for the disorder. Here, we assessed the combined effects of neonatal iron feeding and environmental paraquat exposure on age-related nigrostriatal degeneration in transgenic mice expressing the A53T familial mutant form of human α-synuclein within these neurons. We report here that A53T α-synuclein mice exhibit greater susceptibility to paraquat. Increased oral intake of iron in the neonatal period leads to a progressive age-related enhancement of dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with paraquat neurotoxicity. Furthermore, neurodegeneration associated with these combined genetic and environmental risk factors could be attenuated by systemic treatment with the bioavailable antioxidant compound EUK-189. These data suggest that environmental factors previously identified as contributors to neurodegeneration associated with sporadic Parkinson's disease may also be candidates for observed variations in symptoms and disease progression in monogenic forms and that this may mechanistically involve increased levels of oxidatively-induced post-translational nitration of α-synuclein.
Plasma glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) concentration was studied in 12 volunteers producing gun powder. Serial blood samples were obtained from the cubital vein before and during work at two sites of production; high concentrations of GTN were detected in the plasma. Control specimens from a femoral vein contained much less GTN, indicating that blood in the cubital vein was enriched by dermally absorbed GTN. In the roll mill area concentrations of GTN in the cubital vein were higher than in the press area, but individual factors were also important since some workers consistently had higher concentration of GTN than others. Differences in absorption were more important than differences in the metabolism of GTN since only a small variation in disappearance rate was found after a sublingual test dose of GTN. Moderate changes in pulse rate and blood pressure were noted during the day. The major discomfort experienced was a headache that increased during working hours, but this was not significantly related to GTN concentrations in the air or in the blood from the cubital vein. The observations imply that major efforts should be made to reduce dermal contact with GTN during production work.
The development of estrogen-induced pituitary prolactinoma in Fischer 344 (F344) rats is associated with enhanced neovascularization. Based on the significance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for tumor growth and angiogenesis, we have studied the effect of batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic MMPs inhibitor (MMPI) on the progression of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma in rats. Pituitary tumors were induced in male F344 rats by s.c. implantation of Silastic tubes containing diethylstilbestrol (DES). The effects of chronic treatment with BB-94 (30 mg/kg b.w.) on pituitary weight, cell proliferation, apoptosis and vascular density were evaluated. We have stated that chronic treatment with batimastat caused a significant reduction in the pituitary weight. Batimastat has been found to decrease cell proliferation evaluated by a number of PCNA-positive stained cell nuclei. A marked increase in the apoptotic index within the pituitary was observed in the study group. Moreover, the density of microvessels identified by CD31 was reduced in the group treated with BB-94. The results of our study provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of batimastat, a synthetic MMPI, on the growth and angiogenesis in an experimental model of human prolactinoma. The ability of BB-94 to suppress established pituitary tumor growth suggests a possible application of MMPIs in the treatment of pituitary adenomas.
Studies demonstrating the antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor activation have been largely derived from the use of receptor-selective ligands. Here, we report the identification of A-836339 [2,2,3,3-tetramethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid [3-(2-methoxy-ethyl)-4,5-dimethyl-3H-thiazol-(2Z)-ylidene]-amide], a potent and selective CB(2) agonist as characterized in in vitro pharmacological assays and in in vivo models of pain and central nervous system (CNS) behavior models. In radioligand binding assays, A-836339 displays high affinities at CB(2) receptors and selectivity over CB(1) receptors in both human and rat. Likewise, A-836339 exhibits high potencies at CB(2) and selectivity over CB(1) receptors in recombinant fluorescence imaging plate reader and cyclase functional assays. In addition A-836339 exhibits a profile devoid of significant affinity at other G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. A-836339 was characterized extensively in various animal pain models. In the complete Freund's adjuvant model of inflammatory pain, A-836339 exhibits a potent CB(2) receptor-mediated antihyperalgesic effect that is independent of CB(1) or mu-opioid receptors. A-836339 has also demonstrated efficacies in the chronic constrain injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain, skin incision, and capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical hyperalgesia models. Furthermore, no tolerance was developed in the CCI model after subchronic treatment with A-836339 for 5 days. In assessing CNS effects, A-836339 exhibited a CB(1) receptor-mediated decrease of spontaneous locomotor activities at a higher dose, a finding consistent with the CNS activation pattern observed by pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging. These data demonstrate that A-836339 is a useful tool for use of studying CB(2) receptor pharmacology and for investigation of the role of CB(2) receptor modulation for treatment of pain in preclinical animal models.
