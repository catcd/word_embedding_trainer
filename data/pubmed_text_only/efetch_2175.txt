Many astronauts exhibit post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension due to inadequate norepinephrine release when in an upright posture. We hypothesized that an alpha1-adrenergic agonist, midodrine, would be an effective countermeasure. A female astronaut, who had problems with postflight orthostatic hypotension after a previous flight, consumed 10 mg midodrine after a subsequent flight, prior to her tilt test. Hemodynamic variables were compared between the two flights. Midodrine prevented severe falls in stroke volume, cardiac output and systolic pressure, and severe increases in heart rate without increasing vascular resistance, thus preventing orthostatic hypotension. This is the first report showing that midodrine has the potential to improve post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension and suggesting that reduced venous return contributes to the etiology.
A rare case of morbid vasospasm, together with striking angiographic findings, is described secondary to the ingestion of methysergide by a 48-year-old woman. A brief review of the literature on similar cases is presented. A discussion of the history of ergot includes its original discovery, the epidemics of gangrene that it has caused through the ages and its past and present role in the management of migraine headache. Despite the advent of calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic antagonists, ergot preparations continue to play a major role in migraine therapy, so that the danger of St. Anthony's fire persists.
Two thousand six hundred and seventy one liver biopsies were reviewed from 1972 to 1985 at the Hospital A. Posadas. There were 26 patients with drug-induced liver injury; those who fulfilled the following criteria were included: contact with a drug known to produce hepatotoxicity; clinic, biologic and histologic picture corresponding to the drug studied, complete recovery after the drug was stopped and no other hepatic toxics. Fourteen patients showed estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, 5 had hepatitis-like lesions due to: alphamethyldopa (3), ketoconazole (1) and indomethacin (1). Carbon tetrachloride caused fatty degeneration in two patients and phenylbutazone a granulomatous hepatitis in one patient and cholestatic hepatitis in other. The last three cases were cholestatic lesions after the administration of chlorpromazine allopurinol and penicillin respectively. The evolution in 24 patients was excellent after the drug was withdrawn. Two patients died because of surgical complications since they were operated on with the wrong diagnosis of extrahepatic cholestasis.
This case report describes two children who developed hyperammonemia together with frank manic behavior during treatment with a combination of valproic acid and risperidone. One child had been maintained on valproic acid for years and risperidone was added. In the second case, valproic acid was introduced to a child who had been treated with risperidone for years. In both cases, discontinuing the valproic acid resulted in normalization of ammonia levels and cessation of the manic behavior. This case report alerts physicians to the importance of obtaining serum ammonia levels in children treated with valproic acid and risperidone who present with manic behavior.
Previous studies have reported associations between prenatal arsenic exposure and increased risk of infant mortality. An increase in infectious diseases has been proposed as the underlying cause of these associations, but there is no epidemiologic research to support the hypothesis.
We evaluated the association between arsenic exposure in pregnancy and morbidity during infancy.
This prospective population-based cohort study included 1,552 live-born infants of women enrolled during 2002-2004 in Matlab, Bangladesh. Arsenic exposure was assessed by the concentrations of metabolites of inorganic arsenic in maternal urine samples collected at gestational weeks 8 and 30. Information on symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and diarrhea in infants was collected by 7-day recalls at monthly home visits.
In total, 115,850 person-days of observation were contributed by the infants during a 12-month follow-up period. The estimated risk of LRTI and severe LRTI increased by 69% [adjusted relative risk (RR) = 1.69; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-2.09)] and 54% (RR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.21-1.97), respectively, for infants of mothers with urinary arsenic concentrations in the highest quintile (average of arsenic concentrations measured in early and late gestation, 262-977 µg/L) relative to those with exposure in the lowest quintile (< 39 µg/L). The corresponding figure for diarrhea was 20% (RR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.43).
Arsenic exposure during pregnancy was associated with increased morbidity in infectious diseases during infancy. Taken together with the previous evidence of adverse effects on health, the findings strongly emphasize the need to reduce arsenic exposure via drinking water.
1,3-Butadiene (BD) is a high-volume industrial chemical and a known human carcinogen. The main mode of BD carcinogenicity is thought to involve formation of genotoxic epoxides.
In this study we tested the hypothesis that BD may be epigenotoxic (i.e., cause changes in DNA and histone methylation) and explored the possible molecular mechanisms for the epigenetic changes.
We administered BD (6.25 and 625 ppm) to C57BL/6J male mice by inhalation for 2 weeks (6 hr/day, 5 days a week) and then examined liver tissue from these mice for signs of toxicity using histopathology and gene expression analyses. We observed no changes in mice exposed to 6.25 ppm BD, but glycogen depletion and dysregulation of hepatotoxicity biomarker genes were observed in mice exposed to 625 ppm BD. We detected N-7-(2,3,4-trihydroxybut-1-yl)guanine (THB-Gua) adducts in liver DNA of exposed mice in a dose-responsive manner, and also observed extensive alterations in the cellular epigenome in the liver, including demethylation of global DNA and repetitive elements and a decrease in histone H3 and H4 lysine methylation. In addition, we observed down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1, a histone lysine methyltransferase (Suv39h1), and up-regulation of the histone demethylase Jumonji domain 2 (Jmjd2a), proteins responsible for the accurate maintenance of the epigenetic marks. Although the epigenetic effects were most pronounced in the 625-ppm exposure group, some effects were evident in mice exposed to 6.25 ppm BD.
This study demonstrates that exposure to BD leads to epigenetic alterations in the liver, which may be important contributors to the mode of BD carcinogenicity.
Particulate air pollution with particle diameters less than 2.5μm contribute to respiratory and extra-respiratory morbidity and mortality. We have recently reported the first in vivo experimental evidence that Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) in the lung aggravated the renal, pulmonary, and systemic effects of cisplatin (CP)-induced acute renal failure in rats. This in vitro study sought to determine whether and to what extent does DEP exposure exacerbate the effects of CP-induced oxidative stress in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, and to examine if these effects could be mitigated/prevented with curcumin (the yellow pigment isolated from turmeric). Cells viability, cysteine uptake and oxidative stress indices [glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase; glutathione peroxidase; superoxide dismutase)] were evaluated in all study groups. DEP aggravated the CP- induced HEK-293 cells toxicity, as evidenced by decreasing cell viability and by inducing oxidative stress (GSH depletion, TAC impairment, and antioxidant enzymes inhibition). DEP, but not CP, significantly reduced cysteine uptake. Curcumin prevented the observed DEP and CP-induced cellular insults. These findings suggest that DEP augmented the CP-induced toxicity in HEK-293 cells. Curcumin exhibited a strong potential for protection against DEP and CP-induced cytotoxicity.
Apoptotic neuronal death is known to occur in the developing brain and in the mature brain of patients with ischemic and degenerative disorders. Although microglial cells are known to become activated in specific conditions, it has not been elucidated whether they enhance or prevent neuronal apoptosis. The present study was intended to observe how microglial cells are involved in neuronal death. When rat primary cortical neurons were incubated with a nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 300 microM) for 10 min, neuronal death occurred 12-16 hr later. The NO-induced neuronal death was inhibited by cycloheximide, and the SNP-treated neurons were characterized by nuclear fragmentation and intact cell membrane under electron microscopy. Agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated DNA fragmentation of the SNP-treated neurons. Thus, the NO-induced neuronal death appeared to be apoptosis. When neurons were cocultured with rat primary microglial cells, the SNP treatment failed to induce the neuronal death. Because microglia-conditioned medium also prevented apoptotic neuronal death, microglial cells were considered to secrete antiapoptotic factors. The microglia-conditioned medium rescued neurons even when they were added to neuronal cultures after the SNP treatment, implying that the factors acted on neurons in a manner other than scavenging NO. Interleukin-3, interleukin-6, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are known to be secreted by microglial cells, were not effective in preventing NO-induced neuronal death. Among microglia-derived substances, tumor necrosis factor alpha and plasminogen, which are heat-labile proteins, inhibited neuronal apoptosis. The neuroprotective action of the microglia-conditioned medium, however, still remained, even after it was heated. These findings suggest that microglial cells protect neurons against NO-induced lethal damage by secreting heat-labile and heat-stable neuroprotective factors in vitro.
Dose-related cardiotoxicity limits enthracycline administration in patients with solid tumours or leukaemia. Many patients (70%) would probably benefit by receiving more than a total accumulative dose of 500 mg/m2. As a measure of myocardial function the left ventricular ejection fractions (EF) were determined from serial radionuclide angiograms in 62 children who had at least 3 studies (mean age 8.4 +/- 5.4 years). Seven patients who had clinical evidence of cardiac involvement and/or a marked decline in their EF underwent endmyocardial biopsy (9 x). The EF declined progressively from 63 +/- 7% prior to chemotherapy to 60 +/- 5%, 58 +/- 7% and 54 +/- 7% after low, medium and high-dose anthracycline, respectively in the non-biopsied children vs 58 +/- 4%, 54 +/- 7% and 48 +/- 4% in the biopsied patients. Anthracycline dosage was 129 +/- 42, 307 +/- 68 and 471 +/- 61 mg/m2 and 103 +/- 64, 303 +/- 73 and 536 +/- 93 mg/m2, respectively. The biopsies were obtained at a mean anthracycline dose of 408 mg/m2 when the EF was 46 +/- 5%, and graded according to the modified Billingham score; grade 1 (6 x), 1.5 (2 x) and 2.5 (1 x). A decline in the EF was seen in 89% of our patients throughout their chemotherapy course, with a statistical significance of p less than 0.02 in the biopsied patients after medium dose therapy which was not seen in the non-biopsied children until they were receiving anthracyclines.
The aim of this report was to highlight the fact that hearing loss in thalassaemia patients can be related to marrow expansion affecting the ossicles, resulting in a conductive loss.
A six-year-old boy with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia developed a unilateral hearing loss shortly after commencing desferrioxamine therapy. Ototoxicity was assumed, but the deficit was later found to be of a conductive nature, due to marrow proliferation within the ossicular chain as a consequence of the disease process--a phenomenon previously unreported in the literature.
It is important to elucidate the precise nature of new onset hearing loss in patients receiving iron chelation therapy, in order to avoid unnecessary cessation of much needed medication, on the assumption of ototoxicity.
Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, is important in regulating inflammation. Inflammation of the prostate has been suggested to favor tumor development. A recent study (JNCI 2004, 96:1248-1254) found marginal evidence of an association between the presence of the mature MIC-1 protein nonsynonymous polymorphism H6D C-to-G (rs1058587) with reduced prostate cancer risk [odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.69-0.99]. We tested this in a population-based study of 819 cases and 731 controls from Australia and found a similar, yet not significant, odds ratio of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.7-1.04; P = 0.11). We also tested the potential association between the H6D variant and disease-specific survival in 640 cases followed-up for an average of 8.2 years. We found that cases carrying the H6D G allele had an increased risk of death from prostate cancer than cases carrying two copies of the C allele (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.06-2.78; P = 0.03). Our data suggest that the H6D variant in MIC-1 might play a role in prostate cancer, but it is difficult to explain how a variant can be associated with lower risk of developing prostate cancer but more aggressive growth if cancer develops.
This is the first reported case in the emergency medicine literature of a drug interaction between warfarin and fluconazole. We present a case of spinal epidural haematoma and summarize four other case reports reported elsewhere from 1988 to 1996. We admonish emergency physicians to be aware of this dangerous drug combination. Warfarin and fluconazole are frequently encountered drugs in the emergency department and thus any interaction between these drugs is of considerable importance.
Acetaminophen (APAP) and 7-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (7-OH-AAF) each produced a similar incidence of, as well as a qualitatively similar, abnormal closure of the anterior neuropore at similar concentrations when added to the medium of cultured rat embryos. At concentrations producing a 50-65% incidence of abnormal neurulation, the affected embryos displayed relatively complete embryonic development as assessed from measurements of protein, axial rotation, and embryonic length. The neural tube defect produced by these agents consisted of elevated neural folds remaining separated by approximately 45 degrees as well as the presence of a mitotically active neural epithelium. In contrast, the nonacetylated structures, p-aminophenol (PAP) and 7-hydroxyaminofluorene (7-OH-AF), were embryotoxic at concentrations 10-fold lower than the corresponding acetylated compounds; each produced a greater incidence of abnormal axial rotation and a greater decrease in embryonic protein than APAP or 7-OH-AAF. In addition, the embryos exposed to PAP or 7-OH-AF were morphologically and histologically dissimilar to those exposed to the acetylated compounds. The neural folds of the latter remained elevated and in apposition, but lacked complete fusion of the folds of neural epithelium and were accompanied by marked cytotoxicity. Addition of active deacetylase sources (guinea pig liver microsomes or commercially obtained, purified carboxylic-ester hydrolase) to the culture medium of conceptuses exposed to 7-OH-AAF or APAP resulted in an increased embryotoxicity which was indistinguishable from that produced by the nonacetylated compounds alone. The increases in toxicity were effectively blocked by the addition of paraoxon, indicating that catalysis of the deacetylation of APAP and 7-OH-AAF was the causative factor. No evidence could be found for deacetylation of 7-OH-AAF or APAP mediated by the Day 10 conceptus itself. When examined for cytotoxicity in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, APAP and 7-OH-AAF each produced observable cell death only if reduced glutathione (GSH) had previously been depleted and if a deacetylase source were present; this cytotoxicity was also blocked by addition of paraoxon. The nonacetylated metabolites were directly cytotoxic, although GSH depletion greatly increased the incidence of cell death. Therefore, deacetylation of APAP and 7-OH-AAF produced an increase in generalized embryotoxicity and cytotoxicity relative to abnormal neurulation, suggesting that APAP and 7-OH-AAF are capable of eliciting neural tube defects via a mechanism(s) that is distinguishable from the generalized embryotoxicity or cytotoxicity produced by their nonacetylated counterparts.
"Punding" is a stereotypical motor behavior in which there is an intense fascination with repetitive handling and examining of mechanical objects, such as picking at oneself or taking apart watches and radios or sorting and arranging of common objects, such as lining up pebbles, rocks, or other small objects. It is thought to be dopamine-related although only a single report of punding in a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) resulting from L-dopa has been reported. We describe three additional cases. All were women aged 65-72 years with a PD duration between 10 and 20 years, on 500-1900 mg L-dopa per day. One spent hours in the market fascinated by cans. At home she endlessly examined and catalogued her jewelry. Another picked threads in rugs indoors and weeded her garden compulsively to the point of wetting herself rather than stopping. The third hoarded flashlights taking them apart and reassembling them. All improved with reduction of their anti-PD medications. We think punding is an uncommon but overlooked complication of dopaminergic drugs.
Eight novel 2-pyrazolines (2a-h) were synthesized by the reaction of appropriate chalcones/flavanones with 4-hydrazinonbenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride and tested for anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Two compounds 2c and 2e showed good anti-inflammatory activity which is comparable to the reference drug celecoxib in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema bioassay and found safe from the point of view of ulcer induction. Compounds 2c and 2e showed very mild inhibition against the enzymatic activity of ovine COX-1 and COX-2 (in vitro). The compounds 2c and 2f exhibited considerable antitumor activity against tested 60 human tumor cell lines. Specifically, compound 2f exhibited promising anti-proliferative activity with GI(50) values less than 2 μM particularly against MOLT-4 (1.94), SR (1.28) in leukemia cancer, EKVX (1.88) in non small cell lung cancer, COLO 205 (1.69) in colon cancer.
Three cases are described with documented ventricular fibrillation shortly after the patients received disopyramide in moderate dosage. Electrocardiograms showed markedly prolonged Q-T intervals in two patients and a prominent U wave with a prolonged Q-U interval in one patient, but no change in QRS width. Disopyramide-induced ventricular fibrillation appears to be similar to that caused by quinidine and is an indication to discontinue the drug.
A study involving more than 2,000 infants was conducted in Vietnam to assess the field effectiveness and immunogenicity of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine given at birth, 1 month, 2 months, without concomitant hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). All received a 5 microg dose of H-B-VAX II at birth. Infants born to non-carrier mothers (Group 1; N = 1798) then received 2.5 microg doses at 1 and 2 months of age, while infants of HBeAg-negative (Group 2; N = 125) or HBeAg-positive (Group 3; N = 88) carrier mothers received 5 microg doses. No Group 1 or 2 vaccinees were infected. In Group 3, 12 (14.6%) of 82 infants did become infected (estimated efficacy 84%). 98.0-98.6% of uninfected infants who were tested for anti-HBs developed a seroprotective concentration > or = 10 IU/L. In hyperendemic Vietnam, where routine maternal screening and passive-active prophylaxis of high-risk infants with vaccine plus HBIG is not feasible, administration of vaccine alone to all newborns may control effectively HBV infection.
Chronic hypertension has been reported to produce adverse cognitive effects in elderly individuals, perhaps by altering central nervous system hemodynamics. The beneficial or adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs on these processes are not well understood. We examined the effects of captopril (90 mg/kg/day) and propranolol (80 mg/kg/day) on cognitive function and brain blood flow in hypertensive and normotensive rats. Cognitive function was assessed by the Morris water maze, and regional brain blood flow was measured by the [14C]iodoantipyrine method. Nineteen-month-old propranolol-treated hypertensive rats exhibited poorer performance (p < .05) than control rats and had lower brain blood flows, particularly in white matter regions (p < .01). Captopril-treated hypertensive rats did not differ significantly from control rats with regard to either cognitive performance or brain blood flow. In the normotensive rats, there were no effects of either drug on cognitive performance or brain blood flow. Thus, blood pressure reduction by propranolol but not captopril has an adverse effect on cognitive function and brain blood flow in hypertensive rats.
The effect of botulinum toxin (BT) upon the human body has so far been measured by using clinical scales monitoring its overall therapeutic effect upon the disorders treated. Clinical scales, however, usually lack sensitivity, are rarely validated and are integrating a number of uncontrollable parameters. After validation of the methodology in a group of 10 controls, we investigated the BT-induced amplitude reduction of the maximal voluntary electromyographic activity (M-EMG amplitude reduction) of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in a group of 34 patients with cervical dystonia undergoing regular BT therapy with Botox (Allergan, Irvine, Calif., USA; n = 16) or Dysport (Ipsen, Maidenhead, UK; n = 18). With Botox doses of 20 mouse units the M-EMG amplitude reduction was 80% (SD = 3.9%, n = 4), with 40 it was 84% (SD = 10.8%, n = 4), with 60 it was 85% (SD = 2.6%, n = 2) and with 80 it was 91% (SD = 5.8%, n = 6). With Dysport doses of 100 mouse units the M-EMG amplitude reduction was 70% (SD = 7.6%, n = 4), with 200 it was 85% (SD = 10.4%, n = 5), with 300 it was 83% (SD = 9.2%, n = 3), with 400 it was 78% (SD = 6.7%, n = 3) and with 500 it was 91% (SD = 5.8%, n = 5). The methodology presented can measure M-EMG amplitude reductions with a precision of about 10%. Dose-efficacy relationships can be used for dose optimisation, evaluation of BT therapy failure and comparison of different preparations and types of BT.
To report the early ocular pathologic findings associated with high-dose carmustine and cisplatin therapy.
A patient with metastatic breast carcinoma developed an acute onset of branch retinal artery occlusion, bilateral blindness, and a myelopathy involving the lower extremities after high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant.
Histopathologic examination of the eye and optic nerves at autopsy disclosed nerve fiber layer infarction secondary to right inferior temporal retinal artery thrombosis. Patchy necrosis of both optic nerves, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord was associated with focal small-vessel thrombosis.
The syndrome of retinal vascular occlusion, optic neuropathy, and myelopathy is associated with the high-dose chemotherapeutic agents carmustine and cisplatin. The distribution of necrosis suggests an ischemic event rather than direct neurotoxic effects.
To investigate the effects of the rho-kinase inhibitor hydroxyfasudil on bladder overactivity in cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis.
Female Sprague-Dawley rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of CYP (200 mg/kg). Four days later, bladder function was evaluated by: (i) monitoring micturition behavior in metabolic cages between hydroxyfasudil- and vehicle-treated animals; (ii) measuring changes in continuous cystometrograms in response to intravenous hydroxyfasudil under anesthesia; and (iii) conducting a functional study examining the effect of hydroxyfasudil on the concentration-response curves to carbachol in bladder tissue strips.
Intraperitoneal injection of hydroxyfasudil (10 mg/kg) significantly increased both the average and maximal voided volumes. Hydroxyfasudil significantly decreased the maximal detrusor pressure, whereas the intercontraction interval was not significantly affected. After administration of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 microM hydroxyfasudil, the maximal contraction of the concentration-response curves to carbachol was significantly reduced to 74.5 +/- 4.2%, 55.2 +/- 5.6%, 29.4 +/- 5.6%, and 21.6 +/- 8.2% of the control values, respectively.
The present findings indicate that hydroxyfasudil might be a new treatment option for CYP-induced detrusor overactivity.
After the advent of levodopa, treatment of Parkinson's disease has changed and the activity of daily life of patients has been remarkably improved; whereas, many patients experience various problems such as wearing-off, dyskinesia, dystonia, neuropsychiatric problems, and dysautonomia. Especially, wearing-off and dyskinesia emerge with the change of absorptional pattern of levodopa and could be solved by regulating the timing and the dose of it. Recently, some new drugs for Parkinson's disease have been available and we physician have a wide choice of them. It is important to make a careful choice of and manipulate of doses of drugs after understanding daily life of each patient enough.
Epilepsy is one of the most common presentations of patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). MELAS is typically caused by an A-to-G substitution at nucleotide position 3243 of mitochondrial DNA. Valproic acid, a common anticonvulsant, can actually increase the frequency of seizures in individuals with MELAS. Here, we report a single case-study of a 38-year-old man who presented with focal seizures and had MELAS Syndrome due to the A3243G mitochondrial DNA mutation. Manifestation of epilepsia partialis continua was aggravated by use of valproic acid. Convulsions abated after discontinuation of valproic acid. Our experience suggests that valproic acid should be avoided for the treatment of epilepsy in individuals with mitochondrial disease.
We investigated the effect of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the oxidized form of vitamin C which is a superoxide scavenger, on manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), copper-zinc SOD (CuZnSOD), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia under normo- and hyperglycemic conditions. Edema formation was also assessed. MnSOD, CuZnSOD, COX-2 and IL-1beta mRNA and protein expression were studied 3 h post-ischemia. No changes were observed in MnSOD and CuZnSOD mRNA expression among the groups. COX-2 and IL-1beta mRNA expression were upregulated by ischemia but were not influenced by the glycemic state. At the protein level, hyperglycemic cerebral ischemia increased MnSOD and CuZnSOD [Bémeur, C., Ste-Marie, L., Desjardins, P., Butterworth, R.F., Vachon, L., Montgomery, J., Hazell, A.S., 2004a. Expression of superoxide dismutase in hyperglycemic focal cerebral ischemia in the rat. Neurochem. Int. 45, 1167-1174] and IL-1beta expression compared to normoglycemic ischemia. COX-2 protein expression was also significantly higher following hyperglycemic ischemia compared to hyperglycemic shams. DHA administration did not change the pattern of COX-2 or IL-1beta mRNA expression, but normalized the increased protein expression following hyperglycemic ischemia. DHA administration also normalized MnSOD and CuZnSOD protein expression to the levels observed in normoglycemic ischemic animals. Edema formation was significantly reduced by DHA administration in hyperglycemic ischemic animals. The DHA-induced post-transcriptional normalization of MnSOD, CuZnSOD, COX-2 and IL-1beta levels and the decreased edema formation suggest that hyperglycemia accelerates superoxide formation and the inflammatory response, thus contributing to early damage in hyperglycemic stroke and strategies to scavenge superoxide should be an important therapeutic avenue.
Lamivudine therapy improves hepatic necro-inflammatory activity, decreases progression of fibrosis, and suppresses hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Famciclovir has also been shown to have some effect in the suppression of HBV replication. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of treatment with lamivudine and famciclovir on serum HBV DNA levels in patients with chronic hepatitis B and to assess safety. A prospective randomised clinical study was carried out on 100 patients with chronic hepatitis B infection (50 patients received lamivudine 100 mg daily and 50 patients received famciclovir 500 mg three times a day for 12 weeks. From the twelfth week onwards, patients were offered lamivudine 100 mg daily up to 48 weeks). Significantly more patients treated by lamivudine than by famciclovir had undetectable HBV DNA levels after 12 weeks of therapy (P < 0.001). The median HBV DNA levels were significantly lower in the lamivudine-treated patients from the second week of treatment onwards (P < 0.001 for all time points up to 12 weeks). At week 16, 4 weeks after the famciclovir treated patients were put on lamivudine, there was no longer any difference in HBV DNA levels between the two groups of patients. Both treatments were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. It was concluded that in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, lamivudine achieved effective suppression of HBV DNA levels within 4 weeks of therapy whereas famciclovir had a significantly weaker action.
To present an unusual case of orbital compartment syndrome after endoscopic sinus surgery.
Case report.
Acute proptosis, chemosis, decreased vision, and ophthalmoplegia were found immediately after endoscopic sinus surgery. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed a tense orbit, and intraocular pressure increased to 54 mm Hg. Treatment was initiated and the intraocular pressure dropped. Computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of bacitracin ointment in the orbit.
Ophthalmic complications after sinus surgery are well identified. Postoperative orbital compartment syndrome may be caused by retrobulbar hemorrhage, edema, air (emphysema), or foreign material. In this case, the findings were caused by inadvertent injection of bacitracin ointment into the orbit.
