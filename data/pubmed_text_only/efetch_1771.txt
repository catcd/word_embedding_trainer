Immature A/J mice were treated with a series of alternate (every 4 days) doses of triamcinolone hexacetonide, a long-acting synthetic analogue of cortisol, and their masseter muscles were studied ultrastructurally. Various degrees of degenerative changes were found in most myofibers of triamcinolone-treated animals. These changes ranged from local alterations in the configuration of the Z discs to a complete disarray of the myofibrilar architecture. Severely affected myofibers revealed areas with total disintegration of myofilaments, loss of mitochondria, and an almost total depletion of glycogen. In addition, some nuclei were centrally located and an obvious enhancement of collagen fibrillogenesis was found in the endomysial spaces. The latter comprised a mixture of banded collagen fibrils and slender filaments which lacked any specific orientation of organization. Endothelial cells of intramuscular capillaries were hypertrophic, thus evoking a marked occlusion of the vascular lumen. Ultrastructural changes were also noted in axon terminals and in the sole-plate sarcoplasm: loss of synaptic vesicles along with shrinkage of axon terminals, partial loss of postsynaptic folds, and a decrease in the number of mitochondria within the sole-plate sarcoplasm. It is proposed that triamcinolone, even if administered on an alternate schedule, promotes myopathic changes in the masseter muscles of immature mice which, in turn, might possibly contribute to the hormone-retardive effect upon the growth potential of the developing mandible.
Both the pathogenetic interpretation and treatment of phenobarbital-induced rheumatism are uncertain. The reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome which complicates antiepileptic drug therapy is a problem for rheumatologists. The aim of our study was to test the effect of gabapentin as an additional therapy in patients suffering from phenobarbital-induced shoulder-hand syndrome when these patients were treated with gabapentin instead of receiving phenobarbital only. After a 3-month observation period, the pain and the movement range from the shoulder to the wrist and to the hand improved more than in the control group using acetaminophen. Further studies are required to confirm this observation.
The authors report on four cases of immediate hepatotoxic reaction following diagnostic re-exposure. In checking 27 patients who had received NPAB treatment for the first time, four were found to have a hepatotoxic reaction that developed within 13--20 days after beginning the treatment. In view of the significance of NPAB for the treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders, further such studies are required in order to define the actual risk involved in this procedure.
We retrospectively reviewed the effects on the erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the use of stavudine-including antiretroviral regimens in both zidovudine-naive and zidovudine-experienced HIV-infected patients. Macrocytosis was commonly observed among patients on stavudine-based regimens although the MCV usually stabilized at a lower level than that observed with zidovudine.
Epidemiological evidence indicates that estrogens are one of the risk factors of breast cancer. However, there have been reports that pre-pubertal estrogen exposure is related to reduced breast cancer risk. These discrepancies made us investigate the time-point and duration of estrogen exposure. Our studies focus on the effect of estradiol-3-benzoate (EB) on the mammary gland that was exposed to carcinogens. Ninety-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups. Animals at 7 weeks of age were injected with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) in groups 1, 2 and 3 or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in groups 4, 5 and 6. One week later, the animals were subjected to sustained treatment with 0 micro g (groups 1 and 4), 30 micro g (groups 2 and 5) or 300 micro g (groups 3 and 6) of EB containing pellets for 4 weeks. All animals were sacrificed at 5 weeks or 21 weeks after carcinogen treatment, for the examination of mammary gland differentiation or mammary gland tumors, respectively. At 21 weeks after carcinogen treatment, the incidence of mammary tumors in group 2 was significantly decreased (P<0.05). EB treatment decreased the multiplicity of DMBA- or MNU-induced mammary gland tumors. At 5 weeks after carcinogen treatment, there were increased branchings of the mammary gland, and there was also a decrease of ERalpha and ERbeta in EB treatment groups. Taken together with these results, we conclude that EB has an inhibitory effect on mammary carcinogenesis, and it suggests that this inhibition may be associated with the differentiation of mammary gland and modulation of ERalpha and ERbeta.
Excessive release or administration of beta-mimetic catecholamines may induce cardiomegaly, necrotic lesions and accumulation of connective tissue in the heart of adult homoiotherms. It was examined here whether similar changes can also be observed at different stages of evolution of the cardiovascular system, i.e. in poikilotherms and in homoiotherms during embryonic life. Sensitivity of the poikilothermic hearts (carp, frog, turtle) to isoproterenol (IPRO) was significantly lower than in the homoiotherms. Necrotic lesions, if present, were localized in the inner spongious musculature which has no vascular supply but which exhibits higher activities of enzymes connected with aerobic oxidation. Moreover, the IPRO-induced decrease of the phospholipid content was also significantly more expressed in the spongious layer. IPRO treatment did not influence the total weight of the fish heart but the proportion of the outer compact layer was significantly higher. These changes were accompanied by an increase of collagen, higher water content and an increase of isomyosin with a lower ATPase activity. The response of the poikilothermic heart to IPRO-induced overload thus differs significantly from that in the homoiotherms. The administration of IPRO during embryonic life of homoiotherms (chick) induces serious cardiovascular disturbances, including cardiomegaly and cellular oedema. Necroses of myofibrils, characteristic of IPRO-induced lesions of adults, were, however, rather exceptional. IPRO did not elevate the concentration of 85Sr (as a calcium homologue) in the immature myocardium; it seems, therefore, that IPRO-induced changes of the embryonic heart are not necessarily due to an intracellular calcium overload. It may be concluded that the character of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy is not uniform and depends strictly on the stage of cardiac development.
The purpose of Holicos-PAT was to investigate the efficacy of serum lipid lowering by pravastatin against coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in the Japanese population. Hypercholesterolemic men and women (n = 2,232), aged 40-70 years, were followed up for 5 years, while they were receiving pravastatin (group P, n = 1,422) or only diet therapy (group C, n = 810). The primary endpoint was CHD (a composite of onset or worsening of angina pectoris, performing CABG or PTCA, non-fatal myocardial infarction, death from CHD including heart death or sudden death). The secondary endpoints were comprised of CVD, total mortality, variation of serum lipid and apoprotein levels, and a relationship between the LDL-C level and occurrence of CHD. For several reasons (proving to meet the exclusion criteria after registration, etc.), 1,290 cases of group P and 749 cases of group C were used as subjects for the primary analysis. The mean follow-up period was 4.5 years in group P and 4.2 years in group C for events of CHD. The mean LDL-C level (SD) in group P was 176 (29) mg/dl and decreased to 134 (29) mg/dl one year later. This effect continued during the follow-up period.CHD events occurred in 9.2/1000 patient-years for men and 2.4/1000 patient-years for women without a history of CHD.CHD events occurred in 55.3/1000 patient-years for men and 23.6/1000 patient-years for women with a history of CHD, which was 6 times higher in men and 10 times higher in women than in those without a history of CHD, respectively. The adjusted relative risk ratio of group P to group C for CHD events was 0.74 (95%CI: 0.47-1.19). In the patients with a history of CHD, the ratio was 0.55 (95%CI: 0.30-1.00). The effect was apparent in the patients with a history of CHD. The incidence of myocardial infarction in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia living in the Hokuriku district was apparently lower, than the worldwide incidence, indicative that pravastatin may have a tendency to inhibit the occurrence of events of arteriosclerotic disease.
Status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine in rats induces massive tissue damage comprising neurons and astrocytes (incomplete infarction) in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and in basal cortical areas (BCTX). Immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal antiserum and a monoclonal antibody to GFAP were used here to study the astroglial damage in these regions. Control sections showed a strong labeling for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for both antibodies in SNR and BCTX. At 1 day after induction of seizures, labeling with the polyclonal antibodies showed diffuse increase within the lesioned areas and enhanced staining of astrocytes at the border zones. However, staining with the monoclonal antibody was abolished. At 3 days, labeling with both the polyclonal antiserum and the monoclonal antibody was severely reduced within the damaged regions. Reactive astrocytes in the surround of the infarct showed enhanced labeling with both antibodies. This combination of enhanced labeling with polyclonal antibodies and decreased labeling with the specific monoclonal antibody for GFAP can be taken as indicator for acute glial cell damage in seizures and related experimental conditions.
The endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)-1 gene is a candidate for human blood pressure (BP) regulation and we report the identification of the new gene variants T-839G, C-338A, L75F, A677V and C+295T. Transient transfection of the reporter constructs containing the -338A allele showed an increase in promoter activity compared with the wild-type promoter. EMSA revealed the specific binding of E2F-2 to both ECE-1b promoter sequences, with the -338A allele being associated with an increased affinity to E2F-2 compared with -338C. The clinical relevance of this finding was analyzed in 704 hypertensive patients. In untreated hypertensive women, both the -338A and -839G alleles were significantly associated with ambulatory BP values. This study provides the first evidence of a link between the cell-cycle-associated E2F family and BP regulation via a component of the endothelin system.
Iatrogenic cocaine toxicity was observed in a 5.5-month-old male who received intranasal cocaine as a topical anesthetic for laryngoscopy. He became agitated, diaphoretic, tachycardic, and hypertensive shortly following the procedure. To control his signs and symptoms, he required 3 doses of IV lorazepam. Systemic absorption and toxicity can vary amongst individuals, making it difficult to determine appropriate dosing. The maximum dose of 1 mg/kg in children has not been validated and toxicity may appear at a much lower dose in certain individuals. Pediatric patients receiving topical cocaine as an anesthetic must be given the lowest possible dose, and then carefully monitored for signs of systemic absorption.
The main objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility of administering high doses of cyclophosphamide plus recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) every 14-21 days to patients with follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma. For each patient, the treatment was not considered feasible if fewer than four cycles of cyclophosphamide chemotherapy could be administered on schedule (i.e. at least every 29 days) or (1) hospitalization of the patient for longer than three days was necessary for neutropenic fever (38 degrees C) or bacteriologically documented infection in > 50% of the cycles, or (2) grade > or = 2 hemorrhage in association with thrombocytopenia of grade > or = 3 severity occurred in > 50% of the cycles or (3) non-hematologic toxicity (excluding nausea/vomiting and alopecia) of grade > or = 3 occurred in > 50% of cycles. The goal was to have a treatment program feasible in 75% or more of the treated patients. The secondary objectives were to determine the toxicities, the complete and partial response rates, and the time to treatment failure (TTF). The trial also attempted to assess the effectiveness of this treatment program in eradicating Bcl-2 rearrangements by PCR, and to assess complete remission duration in relationship to PCR results in patients who respond to this chemotherapy program. Patients were required to have histologically documented non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the subtypes follicular, predominantly small cleaved cell (IWF-B) or follicular mixed, (IWF-C). Patients were required to have Stage IV disease including histologic evidence of bone marrow involvement. Measurable disease was required and patients were also required to have one of the following risk factors: > or = 2 extranodal sites, node or nodal group > or = 5 cm. Submission of fresh bone marrow for molecular genetic studies for the presence of Bcl-2-Ig fusion DNA was mandatory in previously untreated patients. Patients had to be between 18 and physiologic age 55 years (carefully selected patients over age 55 years were also eligible), expected survival > 2 years, performance status 0-1, and have adequate renal, hepatic and bone marrow function, and a cardiac ejection fraction > or = 50%. Cyclophosphamide 4.5 g/m2 i.v. was given with mesna every 14 days with rhG-CSF support. Twenty-nine patients were accrued to this trial. The median follow-up time is 5.0 years, with a range of 2.5-6.7 years. The overall response rate was 75% (9 CRs 37.5%, 9PRs 37.5%). The median duration of survival is 5.53 years. The 1-year estimated probability of freedom from treatment failure was 50% and of survival at 1 year was 92%. No strong association was observed between TTF and age, symptomatic stage, histology performance status, number of extranodal sites or baseline Bcl-2 status. At 3 years the survival of all patients was 78% and failure free survival was 17%. 15 (62%) of the 24 eligible previously untreated patients met the criteria for feasibility specified in the protocol. The 95% CI for the feasibility rate is (44 and 82%). Twenty-two of the 24 (92%) previously untreated patients had specimens submitted for testing for Bcl-2 rearrangements. Thirteen of the 22 (59%) were found to have rearrangements at baseline. Post-treatment specimens were submitted for seven of the 13 patients. Four of the seven converted to Bcl-2 negative following treatment. Eight of 13 Bcl-2 positive patients (62%) had a clinical response to treatment. The 95% exact binomial CI for the total response rate in this subgroup is (28 and 88%). This study demonstrates that repetitive doses of cyclophosphamide at 4.5 g/m2 every two weeks with rhG-CSF support can be administered to selected younger patients with advanced follicular lymphoma with morphologic involvement of the bone marrow with acceptable non-hematologic toxicity.
This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-groups comparison of alclometasone dipropionate and desonide ointments (0.05%) applied twice daily without occlusion for 3 weeks by patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Data from thirty-three patients in each group showed that both treatments produced rapid amelioration of erythema, induration, and, especially, scaling; substantial improvement was evident after 1 week and continued thereafter. Differences between the groups were not statistically significant, but trends consistently favoured alclometasone. No adverse drug reaction occurred.
A 41-year-old man rapidly developed quadriparesis moments after injecting cocaine. Investigation discovered a cervical spinal epidural hematoma. This complication of cocaine abuse has not been previously reported.
A retrospective review of cases consulted by the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Poison Control Center during a 2-year period was performed to determine the causes and consequences of seizures associated with poisoning and drug intoxication. Of 233 charts coded as involving seizures, 191 occurred in humans and were available for analysis. The leading causes of seizures reported to the Poison Control Center were cyclic antidepressants (55 cases, 29%); cocaine and other stimulants (55 cases, 29%); diphenhydramine and other antihistamines (14 cases, 7%); theophylline (10 cases, 5%); and isoniazid (10 cases, 5%). Stimulants and diphenhydramine were more likely than other drugs to produce brief, self-limited seizures. In contrast, poisoning by cyclic antidepressants, cardiodepressant antiarrhythmic agents, or theophylline was more likely to be associated with death. Seizures in elderly patients were more likely to result in complications and death. The frequency of seizure-related cases by substance type was also compared with the results of an earlier survey performed in 1981, and found a striking increase in the proportion of seizures caused by cocaine and (23% in 1988 to 1989 compared with 4% in 1981). Poison Control Center data can provide valuable information about the causes and consequences of drug-related medical complications, as well as highlight changing trends in drug-related injury.
Torsade de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, associated with prolonged QT interval and characterized by twisting of the mean electrical axis of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric line. The long QT syndrome can be divided into two categories, congenital and acquired. The congenital long QT syndrome may be caused by some gene mutation, whereas the acquired form is usually associated with drugs and electrolyte imbalance. It usually remains asymptomatic or causes presyncope, although it may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and may cause sudden death. The different presentation depends on the polymorphism that characterizes genotypic and phenotypic expression of proteic channel subunits, and on drug toxicity that provoke subunit dysfunction. The case report presented here is an example of prolonged QT interval syndrome in a patient with cocaine abuse and electrolyte disturbances.
Neuropathy target esterase (neurotoxic esterase, NTE), a protein thought to be involved in the production of organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN), has been postulated to be a component of endogenous neuronal protein phosphorylation systems. The purpose of this work was to test this hypothesis as well as to investigate further the role of endogenous protein phosphorylation in toxic neuropathies. White Leghorn hens were dosed with the neuropathic compounds di-1-butyl-2,2-dichlorovinyl phosphate (dibutyl dichlorvos, DBDCV), tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), or acrylamide, and regions from brain were fractionated into axolemmal, synaptosomal, and microsomal preparations. Radiolabeling of NTE or endogenously phosphorylated proteins was carried out by incubation with [14C]-DFP or gamma-[32P]-ATP, respectively. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography. Relative amounts of phosphoproteins were quantified by densitometry of the autoradiographs. Changes in endogenous phosphorylation of a protein exhibiting the characteristics of NTE were not observed in these experiments. However, levels of a [32P]-labeled 50-kDa brainstem axolemmal protein were decreased significantly on d 15, but not on d 1, 3, 7, or 10 after dosing with 2.8 mg/kg DBDCV. Clinical signs of ataxia and histopathological findings of axonal degeneration in the spinocerebellar tracts of the brainstem were evident on d 10-15, and hens were unable to perch on a horizontal wooden rod from d 12 after dosing with DBDCV. The decrease in the 50-kDa phosphoprotein was not observed on d 15 after the production of clinically evident neuropathy with either 14 daily doses of 50 mg/kg acrylamide or with a single dose of 500 mg/kg TOCP. These results suggest that NTE is not an endogenously phosphorylated protein under the conditions of these experiments. However, an effect on endogenous phosphorylation limited to a 50-kDa axolemmal protein was selectively produced by treatment with a neuropathic dose of DBDCV that was in evidence only after clinical signs and histopathological findings of axonopathy were apparent.
Omeprazole is the first drug designed to block the final step in the acid secretory process within the parietal cell. It has been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, reflux esophagitis, and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Although clinical experience with omeprazole is still limited, many controlled studies have established the short-term safety of this drug. We report the first case of a serious short-term adverse reaction with the use of omeprazole: hemolytic anemia. The patient developed weakness, lethargy, and shortness of breath 2 days after starting therapy with omeprazole. Two weeks after the initiation of therapy, her hematocrit had decreased from 44.1% to 20.4%, and she had a positive direct Coombs antiglobulin test and an elevated indirect bilirubin. After she discontinued the omeprazole, her hemoglobin and hematocrit gradually returned to normal. The mechanism by which omeprazole caused the patient's hemolytic anemia is uncertain, but physicians should be alerted to this possible adverse effect.
We report a patient who developed a severe hypersensitivity reaction, including rash, lymph node enlargement, fever, hepatitis, and eosinophilia, after sulphasalazine therapy. Five years later, he developed a similar reaction after exposure to mesalazine, the salicylic compound of sulphasalazine. We conclude that patients with known severe systemic reaction to sulphasalazine therapy are also at risk for such a reaction when treated with a 5-ASA preparation.
Cefotetan disodium-induced hemolytic anemia has been reported previously, and some of these cases have been severe or fatal. We describe a case of severe hemolytic anemia that occurred in an 80-year-old woman who received cefotetan prophylactically after surgery for a small bowel obstruction. Eight days after the first dose of cefotetan, the patient developed a severe Coomb test-positive hemolytic anemia. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated cefotetan-specific antibodies in her posttreatment serum, which were detectable at a serum dilution up to 1:10 000. The patient received corticosteroid therapy and blood transfusions, with improvement of her hematologic parameters, but died 54 days after admission for respiratory failure. To our knowledge, this is the first use of flow cytometry for the detection of cefotetan-induced red blood cell antibodies. This technique offers a sensitive, rapid, objective method for detecting drug-induced antibodies.
The annual incidence of venous thromboembolism is approximately 117 per 100,000 persons or about 1 per 1000 person-years, with the majority of the disease occurring in the older age groups. Factor V Leiden gene (most common) and the prothrombin G20210A gene mutation are inherited mild to moderate risk factors for hypercoagulability. The anticoagulant warfarin requires close monitoring of the patient's prothrombin time, normalized as the international normalization ratio. Patients with either Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, or VKORC1*2 genotype (c.-1639G>A) require significantly reduced doses, and are at a higher risk of serious bleeding. Thirty-five samples in total, 15 with Factor V Leiden, 18 with prothrombin G2021A mutation, and 2 with both were analyzed for 2C9*2, 2C9*3, and VKORC1 (-1639) allele variants by using the Invader CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphism analysis kit. Eight with CYP2C9*2 C/T, 2 with CYP2C9*3 A/C, 5 with VKORC1 (-1639) A/A, and 22 with VKORC1 (-1639) G/A genotypes or 29 out of 35 (83%) samples analyzed were found with CYP2C9*2 C/T, CYP2C9*3 A/C, VKORC1 (-1639) G/A, or/and VKORC1 (-1639) A/A genotypes. CYP2C9*2 C/T, CYP2C9*3 A/C, VKORC1 (-1639) G/A genotyping might be necessary for patients with Factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin G2021A mutation before warfarin anticoagulant therapy.
The influence of hyperkalemia on the central nervous system and cardiac toxicity of bupivacaine and lidocaine was studied in open-chested mechanically ventilated dogs. The seizure and cardiotoxic doses of intravenously administered lidocaine and bupivacaine were determined in two separate groups of normokalemic (2.7 +/- 0.05 SEM mEq/1) dogs. In the case of both anesthetics, the cardiotoxic dose was found to be approximately four times the seizure dose. Under conditions of hyperkalemia (5.4 +/- 0.08 SEM mEq/1), however, the cardiotoxic doses of both anesthetics were decreased significantly to approximately two times the seizure dose. Hyperkalemia did not change the seizure dose for either anesthetic. The cardiac to seizure dose ratio was decreased significantly for bupivacaine but not for lidocaine. The results of this study suggest that hyperkalemia enhances the cardiotoxic effects of both lidocaine and bupivacaine, with this enhancement being more pronounced in the case of bupivacaine.
Nicorandil exhibits a protective effect in the vascular system, which is thought to be due to vasodilatation from opening ATP-dependent potassium channels and donation of nitric oxide. Recently, nicorandil was shown to be renoprotective in models of acute kidney injury and glomerulonephritis. However, the specific mechanisms of renoprotection are unclear. We evaluated the effect of nicorandil on the rat remnant kidney model of chronic kidney disease. Blood pressure was unchanged by a 10-wk course of nicorandil, while albuminuria was significantly reduced. Glomerular injury and tubulointerstitial injury were also ameliorated by nicorandil. Oxidative stress, as noted by renal nitrotyrosine level and urine 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, were elevated in this model and was significantly reduced by nicorandil treatment. Treatment was associated with maintenance of the mitochondrial antioxidant, manganese SOD, in podocytes and with suppression of xanthine oxidase expression in infiltrating macrophages. Interestingly, these two cell types express sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2), a binding site of nicorandil in the ATP-dependent K channel. Consistently, we found that stimulating SUR2 with nicorandil prevented angiotensin II-mediated upregulation of xanthine oxidase in the cultured macrophage, while xanthine oxidase expression was rather induced by blocking SUR2 with glibenclamide. In conclusion, nicorandil reduces albuminuria and ameliorates renal injury by blocking oxidative stress in chronic kidney disease.
Although rodents have previously been used in ecotoxicological studies, they are expensive, time-consuming, and are limited by strict legal restrictions. The present study used a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model and generated data that was useful for extrapolating toxicant effects in this system to that of humans. Here we treated embryos of the naive-type as well as a transiently transfected zebrafish liver cell line carrying a plasmid (phAhREEGFP), for comparing toxicity levels with the well-known aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-binding toxicants: 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and 3-methylcholanthrene. These toxicants induced a concentration-dependent increase in morphological disruption, indicating toxicity at early life-stages. The transient transgenic zebrafish liver cell line was sensitive enough to these toxicants to express the CYP1A1 regulated enhanced green fluorescent protein. The findings of this study demonstrated that the zebrafish in vivo model might allow for extremely rapid and reproducible toxicological profiling of early life-stage embryo development. We have also shown that the transient transgenic zebrafish liver cell line can be used for research on AhR mechanism studies.
To evaluate the effects on hemodynamics and the distribution of blood volume of various calcium entry blocker (CEB) agents, we invasively studied 24 hypertensive patients before and after treatment with isradipine, diltiazem, and verapamil. All three agents reduced arterial pressure through a significant fall in total peripheral resistance without causing reflex tachycardia, while preserving stroke volume and cardiac output. Verapamil reduced the central blood volume (CBV) and the ratio of CBV to total blood volume (TBV) in the supine position (P < .05), suggesting peripheral venodilatation. Isradipine and verapamil modified the responses to head-up tilt. The orthostatic decrease in stroke volume was accentuated following treatment, and it was associated with a greater fall in the ratio of CBV to TBV, suggesting that these two agents attenuate the reflex venoconstriction induced by postural change. In contrast to verapamil and isradipine, diltiazem did not affect volume distribution in the supine or head-up positions. These results suggest that the effect of CEBs varies in order of venodilatory effect from verapamil to isradipine to diltiazem, with verapamil having the greatest effect.
Prolonged postoperative analgesia cannot be achieved using single injections of local anesthetic solutions. The study objective was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a new formulation of bupivacaine loaded in an injectable fatty acid based biodegradable polymer poly(sebacic-co-ricinoleic acid) for producing motor and sensory block when injected near the sciatic nerve. Bupivacaine was dissolved in poly(fatty ester-anhydride) paste and tested for drug release in vitro and in vivo after injection in mice. The efficacy and toxicity of the polymer-drug combination was determined by injecting the polymer formulation near the sciatic nerve of mice and measure the sensory and motor nerve blockade for 48 h, while monitoring the animal general health and the injection site. Seventy percent of the incorporated drug was released during 1 week in vitro. Single injection of 10% bupivacaine in the polymer caused motor and sensory block that lasted 30 h. Microscopic examination of the injection sites revealed only mild infiltration in three of eight examined tissues with no pathological findings for internal organs were found. In conclusion the polymer poly(sebacic-co-ricinoleic acid) is a safe carrier for prolonged activity of bupivacaine.
