To determine if 6 courses of chemotherapy alone could achieve the same or better outcome than 4 courses of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) in pediatric and adolescent patients with Hodgkin disease. Children < or =21 years old with biopsy-proven, pathologically staged I, IIA, or IIIA1 Hodgkin disease were randomly assigned 6 courses of alternating nitrogen mustard, oncovin, prednisone, and procarbazine/doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (treatment 1) or 4 courses of alternating nitrogen mustard, oncovin, prednisone, and procarbazine/doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine +2550 cGy involved-field radiotherapy (treatment 2). The complete response rate was 89%, with a complete response and partial response rate of 99.4%. There was no statistically significant difference in event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival between arms. The EFS for those who achieved an early complete response was significantly higher than for those who did not. For pediatric patients with asymptomatic low-stage and intermediate-stage Hodgkin disease, chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy both resulted in 3-year EFS of approximately 90% and statistically indistinguishable 8-year EFS and overall survival, without significant long-term toxicity. Early response to therapy was associated with higher EFS, a concept that has led to the Children's Oncology Group paradigm of response-based risk-adapted therapy for pediatric Hodgkin disease.
Injection of haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg) immediately after elaboration of the passive avoidance conditioned reflex stabilized retrieval of the conditioned reflex on the 2nd, 7th, and 14th days. Catalepsy induced by haloperidol injection was increased after the completion of passive avoidance conditioning. Conditioned reflex retrieval decreased catalepsy which was retrieved without repeated haloperidol injection. In contrast to the control animals, in the animals after conditioning the most pronounced catalepsy was observed immediately after the conditioned reflex retrieval with the following stabilization at the lower level. The auto enhancement of catalepsy retrieval was more expressed on the 14th day (as compared with the 7th day) both in the control and learned animals, but in the latter it did not depend on the testing time (in contrast to the control animals.
Osmotic nephrosis describes a morphological pattern with vacuolization and swelling of the renal proximal tubular cells. The term refers to a nonspecific histopathologic finding rather than defining a specific entity. Osmotic nephrosis can be induced by many different compounds, such as sucrose, hydroxyethyl starch, dextrans, and contrast media. It has a broad clinical spectrum that includes acute kidney injury and chronic kidney failure in rare cases. This article discusses the pathological characteristics, pathogenesis, and various clinical entities of osmotic nephrosis.
Previous studies have shown disappointing results for immunosuppressive treatment in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Therefore, we studied the effectiveness of such therapy in patients with HLA upregulation on biopsy.
Of 202 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 84 patients with increased HLA expression were randomized to receive either immunosuppression or placebo for 3 months; they were then followed for 2 years. After 2 years, there were no significant differences in the primary end point (a composite of death, heart transplantation, and hospital readmission) between the 2 study groups (22.8% for the immunosuppression group and 20.5% for the placebo). The secondary efficacy end point included changes in ejection fraction, end-diastolic diameter, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and NYHA class; left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly in the immunosuppression group compared with the placebo group (95% CI, 4.20 to 13.12; P<0.001) after 3 months of follow-up. The early favorable effects of immunosuppressive therapy on left ventricular volume, left ventricular diastolic dimension, and New York Heart Association class were also present. This improvement was maintained in the immunosuppression group at 2 years (ejection fraction: 95% CI, 6.94 to 19.04; P<0.001). In addition, on the basis of the protocol-specified definition of improvement, 71.8% patients in the immunosuppression group versus 20.9% patients in the placebo group met the criteria of improvement after 3 months (P<0.001). At the end of the follow-up period, 71.4% patients from the immunosuppression group versus 30.8% patients from the placebo group were improved (P=0.001).
These data demonstrate a long-term benefit of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and HLA upregulation on biopsy specimens. Thus, restoration of immunosuppressive therapy for such patients should be considered.
An elderly woman was admitted for treatment of severe stasis ulceration, associated with varicose veins. One course of cloxacillin was given orally followed by a second course of penicillin-G to eradicate persistant hemolytic streptococcal skin infection. Deep progressive jaundice subsequently developed due to intrahepatic cholestasis and persisted for several weeks before resolution. Having excluded a progressive extrahepatic malignant lesion by appropriate investigations, the diagnosis was substantiated by classical changes present in a percutaneous liver biopsy.
Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits has been implicated in various brain functions, including ethanol tolerance, learning, and seizure susceptibility. In this study, we explored the role of Fyn in haloperidol-induced catalepsy, an animal model of the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics. Haloperidol induced catalepsy and muscle rigidity in the control mice, but these responses were significantly reduced in Fyn-deficient mice. Expression of the striatal dopamine D(2) receptor, the main site of haloperidol action, did not differ between the two genotypes. Fyn activation and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, as measured by Western blotting, were induced after haloperidol injection of the control mice, but both responses were significantly reduced in Fyn-deficient mice. Dopamine D(2) receptor blockade was shown to increase both NR2B phosphorylation and the NMDA-induced calcium responses in control cultured striatal neurons but not in Fyn-deficient neurons. Based on these findings, we proposed a new molecular mechanism underlying haloperidol-induced catalepsy, in which the dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist induces striatal Fyn activation and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B alters striatal neuronal activity, thereby inducing the behavioral changes that are manifested as a cataleptic response.
After the administration of Cibalgin (a Phenazone-derivative) to a lactating mother during the first days after delivery, her healthy newborn infant developed a toxic hemolytic anemia with precipitation of globin, forming large inclusion bodies in the erythrocytes. Phenazone was found in the mothers milk up to 8 days after the end of Cibalgin administration. During the acute phase of hemolysis it could also be demonstrated in the infants serum. A list of medicaments that pass into the milk and can cause a toxic hemolytic anemia in the child is included.
The effects of baclofen on the development of reverse tolerance and postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity induced by morphine were examined in mice. A single administration of morphine induced hyperactivity and the morphine-induced hyperactivity was inhibited dose dependently by the administration of a GABA(B)receptor agonist, baclofen (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1), i.p.). Daily repeated administration of morphine developed reverse tolerance to the hyperactivity of morphine. The concomitant administration of baclofen inhibited the morphine-induced hyperactivity and the baclofen administration prior to and during the chronic administration of morphine in mice inhibited the development of reverse tolerance to the hyperactivity of morphine (10 mg kg(-1), s.c.). Postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity was also developed in reverse-tolerant mice that had received the same morphine. The development of postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity was evidenced by the enhanced ambulatory activity of apomorphine (2 mg kg(-1), s.c.). Baclofen also inhibited the development of postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity induced by the chronic administration of morphine. These results suggest that the hyperactivity, reverse tolerance and postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity induced by morphine may be modulated via the activation of GABA(B)receptors induced by baclofen.
A newborn with massive tricuspid regurgitation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, and a high serum lithium level is described. This is the first patient to initially manifest tricuspid regurgitation and atrial flutter, and the 11th described patient with cardiac disease among infants exposed to lithium compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy. Sixty-three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement. Lithium carbonate may be a factor in the increasing incidence of congenital heart disease when taken during early pregnancy. It also causes neurologic depression, cyanosis, and cardiac arrhythmia when consumed prior to delivery.
What is the optimal chemotherapy regimen in advanced gastric cancer?
Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Despite low incidence rates for gastric cancer in Ontario, the overall prognosis is bleak, with 5-year survival rates of approximately 23% in Canada. Even with the considerable body of research available on chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer, uncertainty remains. There is no recognized standard treatment, and there appears to be geographic variation in practice.
Outcomes of interest were overall survival, objective response rate (complete plus partial responses), time to disease progression, adverse effects, and quality of life.
After a systematic review, a practice guideline containing clinical recommendations relevant to patients in Ontario was drafted. The practice guideline was reviewed and approved by the Gastrointestinal Disease Site Group (gi dsg) and the Report Approval Panel of the Program in Evidence-Based Care. External review by Ontario practitioners was obtained through a survey, the results of which were incorporated into the practice guideline.
The gi dsg makes the following recommendations: To improve survival, a platinum agent should be included in any combination chemotherapy regimen.Within a combination chemotherapy regimen, oral capecitabine is preferred over intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5fu)-that is, epirubicin-cisplatin-capecitabine is preferred over the prior standard regimen, epirubicin-cisplatin-5fu (ecf).Epirubicin-oxaliplatin-capecitabine (eox) is a reasonable alternative to ecf. The choice between ecf and eox should be based on patient preference.Trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (5fu or oral capecitabine) is recommended for advanced gastric cancer positive for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2/neu).
An elderly patient developed confusion, disorientation and visual hallucination twice following discontinuation of fluoxetine. The mental symptoms, however, disappeared after ingestion of this antidepressant drug. Such an apparent withdrawal complication of fluoxetine has not been reported previously.
This study evaluated the selective effects of 2-isopropyl-3-butyl-8-(4-fluorophenylamino)-3H-imidazo[4,5-g]quinazoline (B-2), a member of a series of quinazolines, on the cell survival and growth of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549 in vitro and in vivo. Cytotoxicity assay, hollow fiber assay and cell xenograft model experiment revealed that B-2 showed selective effects on A549 cell survival or growth in a dose-dependent manner. At a dose of 100mg/kg, B-2 showed stronger efficacy on tumor growth inhibition in nude mice than Iressa. Exposure of A549 cells to B-2 caused inhibition of EGFR-dependent ERK-MAPK activation. In addition, inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis might contribute to present the multitarget pathway of non-small cell lung cancer treatment of B-2.
Toxic oil syndrome (TOS) is a disease that appeared in Spain in 1981. Epidemiological work traced the origin to the ingestion of aniline-adulterated rapeseed oil, fraudulently marketed and sold as edible oil. It affected more than 20,000 people with over 400 deaths in the first 2 years. In 2001 evidence was presented that genetic factors could play a role in the susceptibility of individuals to the disease. Thus, a prospective study on the differences in gene expression in sera between control versus TOS-affected populations, both originally exposed to the toxic oil, was undertaken in our laboratory.
Differential protein expression was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Problems related with serum analysis by 2-DE were addressed to improve protein detection in the gel images. Three new commercial systems for albumin depletion were tested to optimize the detection of minor proteins. The use of nonionic reductants or the presence of thiourea in the gels, were also tested.
From the resulting optimized images, a group of 329 major gel spots was located, matched and compared with serum samples. Thirty-five of these protein spots were found to be under- or over-expressed in TOS patients (threefold increase or decrease). Proteins in these spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) peptide map fingerprinting and database search. Several haptoglobin (Hp) isoforms were found to be differentially expressed, showing expression phenotypes that could be related with TOS. Resolution of the homologous α-1s and α-1f chains, with a mass difference of only 0.043Da, was obtained after guanidation of the protein with O-methylisourea. We applied this procedure to the study of the distribution of the Hp alleles HP(2), HP(1s) and HP(1f) in control versus TOS-affected populations. The MALDI-TOF proteotyping method was validated by a parallel analysis of the serum samples by 2-DE.
Data obtained from 54 TOS cases and 48 controls indicate significant differences in the distribution of Hp phenotypes in the two populations. Haptoglobin phenotypes have been reported to have biological and clinical consequences and have been described as risk factors for several diseases. Consequently, it was concluded that haptoglobin polymorphism could play a role in TOS.
The pathogenetic factors involved in norepinephrine- (NE) induced reversible acute renal failure (ARF) were examined in untreated (U) and mannitol-treated (M) animals. At 3 and 24 h after NE infusion renal blood flow (RBF) was significantly higher in M compared to U animals (174 vs. 138 and 191 vs. 148 ml/min, respectively, both P less than 0.05). At 3 h, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was higher in M animals (8 vs. 4 ml/min, P less than 0.01), while at 24 h protection was even greater (18 vs. 3 ml/min, P less than 0.01). In U animals proximal tubule pressure (Pt) was lower at 1 h than before NE (13 vs. 23 mmHg, P less than 0.01); from 1 to 3 h Pt increased to elevated levels in parallel with restoration of RBF (r = 0.62, P less than 0.01). At 3 h in U animals stop-flow pressure (SFP), as an index of glomerular capillary pressure, was below normal (35 vs. 44 mmHg, P less than 0.05) yet Pt was increased (35 vs. 23 mmHg, P less than 0.05). Thus little transglomerular pressure gradient was present for ultrafiltration. Further evidence of tubular obstruction was obtained by microperfusion at 6 nl/min, which increased Pt from 30 to 45 mmHg (P less than 0.001), a finding not present in unobstructed tubules. Delayed excretion (approximately 20 min) of microinjected [3H]inulin also was compatible with renal ischemia and tubule obstruction. Microinjection studies provided no evidence for backleak of tubular fluid. At 1 h, Pt was higher in M vs. U animals (31 vs. 13 mmHg, P less than 0.05). In M animals at 3 h SFP was normal (50 vs. 44 mmHg) and Pt was below SFP (32 vs. 50 mmHg, P less than 0.01), thus preserving a substantial transglomerular pressure gradient for ultrafiltration. In summary, reduced GFR in U animals is characterized by a combination of reduced glomerular capillary pressure and tubule obstruction. In contrast, animals receiving mannitol were protected against ARF through maintenance of glomerular capillary pressure and prevention of tubular obstruction, perhaps by increasing Pt within the first hour of the NE insult.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in women with moderate hypercholesterolemia.
The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks.
Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States.
Women (n = 3390) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers.
Plasma total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study.
Among women, lovastatin (20 to 80 mg/d) produced sustained (12- to 48-week), dose-related changes (P < 0.001): decreases in LDL cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglycerides (9% to 18%), and increases in HDL cholesterol (6.7% to 8.6%). Depending on the dose, from 82% to 95% of lovastatin-treated women achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program goal of LDL cholesterol levels less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), and 40% to 87% achieved the goal of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.1% of women and were dose dependent above the 20-mg dose. Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin (80 mg). Estrogen-replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of lovastatin.
Lovastatin is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in women.
Antagonism of the adenosine A2A receptor offers great promise in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Employing the known pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine A2A antagonist SCH 58261 as a starting point, we identified the potent and selective (vs. A1) antagonist 11h, orally active in the rat haloperidol-induced catalepsy model. We further optimized this lead to the methoxyethoxyethyl ether 12a (SCH 420814), which shows broad selectivity, good pharmacokinetic properties, and excellent in vivo activity.
Caffeine abuse during pregnancy may be a factor in the development of long-term breathing abnormalities. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to monitor adult breathing patterns after in utero exposure to caffeine. This was done by isolating episodes of apnea of more than 6-s duration from the breathing data as obtained by the Cotwatch breathing monitors adapted for rat use. The breathing record obtained over 6 consecutive days was expressed as daily weighted apnea-hypopnea density (WAHD) values. It was shown that administration of caffeine in moderate (30 mg/kg daily) or high (60 mg/kg daily) doses throughout gestation resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in the WAHD value. The experimental offspring were significantly growth retarded in utero and their subsequent growth rates were also affected. The caffeine-exposed pups grew more slowly with growth plateauing at the same age, resulting in smaller adults. A link was suggested between infants with apnea of prematurity, when occurring after the first week, and an increased risk for later apnea and sudden infant death syndrome.
Mutations in the FBN1 gene have been characterised in patients affected by Marfan syndrome and Marfan-related disorders. Starting with genomic DNA, we analysed the FBN1 gene using PCR, SSCP and/or dHPLC analysis, and automatic sequencing of abnormal bands/peaks, in a consecutive series of 508 patients, of which 22 were children less than 5 years old. Our results are comparable with those reported by other groups. In this study we observed 193 mutations, 126 of which previously unreported. A total of 331 relatives (including 51 infants) of 120 probands for whom a family mutation had been identified here or elsewhere, were tested for the presence of that particular mutation. In addition, 4 prenatal tests were carried out. The identification of a mutation allows for early diagnosis, prognosis, genetic counselling, preventive management of carriers and reassurance for unaffected relatives. The importance of knowing in advance the location of the putative family mutation is highlighted by its straightforward application to prenatal and postnatal screening.
A 63-year-old woman, who had been treated with 20 mg of paroxetine and 0.5 mg of alprazolam daily for 1 year and with 50 mg of metoprolol daily for 15 days, presented to a facility elsewhere with presyncope and complete atrioventricular block. Three days after her initial presentation and cessation of metoprolol treatment, she was transferred to our clinic to be considered for permanent pacemaker implantation. Paroxetine treatment was discontinued on day 1 and atrioventricular block resolved on day 5, which was confirmed with a 24-hour Holter recording. No bradyarrhythmia was induced with similar doses of either metoprolol or paroxetine alone. At 2- and 3-year follow-up, the patient was still free of bradyarrhythmia documented with electrocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. To our knowledge, we report the first case of complete atrioventricular block associated with coadministration of paroxetine and metoprolol. Increasing physicians' awareness of drug-induced severe bradyarrhythmia might prevent unnecessary implantation of permanent pacemakers.
Treatment with conventional heparin is effective in experimental mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. However, the long-term effects and safety of this therapy, in particular in the presence of mesangiolysis, have not been assessed. In addition, this therapy has been hampered by bleeding complications. In the present study, therefore, we investigated the long-term effects of a short course of non-anticoagulant (NA) heparin treatment in the anti-Thy 1.1 mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, in which early immune-mediated mesangiolysis subsequently leads to mesangial hyperproliferation. Rats received continuous ip NA-heparin or vehicle during the active mesangioproliferative phase (Days 2 to 9; early treatment) or during the early resolution phase (Days 10 to 17; late treatment). Whereas NA-heparin in the early treatment group did not affect the glomerular macrophage, lymphocyte, or platelet influx, it did lead to significantly decreased glomerular cellularity, mesangial cell proliferation, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin expression (ie, markers of activated mesangial cells), and matrix accumulation as well as to persistent mesangiolytic lesions including microaneurysms. Despite this latter finding, at Day 120, NA-heparin-treated rats of the early treatment group showed significantly better renal function and less proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis than vehicle-infused rats. In contrast, late therapy with NA-heparin neither accelerated resolution of the nephritis or otherwise affected the course of the disease. We conclude that transient NA-heparin therapy is effective in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, both acutely and long term, when it is initiated during the active phase of the disease. Also, NA-heparin therapy is safe even in glomerular diseases accompanied by mesangiolysis.
Applying a metaanalysis, it was examined whether a combination of drugs is superior to monotherapy in the treatment of angina pectoris. The three classical groups of anti-anginal drugs, nitrates, calcium channel blockers and beta-receptor blockers were investigated. For data analysis, patients were divided in those suffering from "angina pectoris" and those suffering from "angina pectoris despite monotherapy." In patients with the inclusion criterium "angina pectoris" combination of drugs is not superior to monotherapy. This applies to the evaluation criteria "improvement of symptoms" and "reduction of ischemia". In patients with the inclusion criterium "angina pectoris despite monotherapy" however, there is a clear superiority of drug combination as compared to monotherapy. Again this applies to the evaluation criteria "improvement of symptoms" and "reduction in myocardial ischemia". With respect to antianginal efficacy all three possible combinations appear to be similar. If the evaluation criterium is "improvement of prognosis" no data are available with regard to drug combination. Furthermore no data are available on the prognostic effect of an anti-anginal therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris. A significant improvement of prognosis could be demonstrated for beta-receptor blocking agents without ISA in unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and in the postinfarction period. The effect of calcium channel blockers on prognosis depends on the substance class applied and on the presence or absence of signs of congestive heart failure. Monotherapy with nifedipine in instable angina and acute myocardial infarction fails to improve prognosis, and there even may be a tendency to adverse effects. In the absence of signs of congestive heart failure verapamil has been demonstrated to improve prognosis in the post infarction period. Likewise, improvement of prognosis by the administration of diltiazem in acute myocardial infarction only could be demonstrated in patients without signs of heart failure. In contrast, in patients with signs of congestive heart failure diltiazem increased the rate of reinfarction and mortality. For nitrates only in acute myocardial infarction a trend towards improved prognosis has been shown. Especially for nitrates the data on prognosis in coronary heart disease available so far are not convincing.
To determine the maximal i.v. administered dose of propofol that would not induce a serious adverse event in nonsedated dogs.
6 clinically normal dogs (3 males and 3 females) between 8 and 12 months old and weighing between 8.8 and 11.3 kg.
Propofol was administered i.v. at an initial dosage of 6.5 mg/kg of body weight at a rate of 20 mg/10 s. Subsequent doses were incrementally increased by 2.5 mg/kg (eg, second dose: 9 mg/kg) and separated by a minimum of 3 days. This procedure was repeated until a dose that induced a serious respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurologic adverse effect was determined.
Apnea was determined to be the serious adverse effect for all dogs. Duration of apnea varied between dogs, but increased in a dose-dependent manner at dosages > 14 mg/kg.
Respiratory depression and apnea are the most likely adverse effects induced by i.v. administration of propofol to dogs. Propofol administered i.v. at a rate of 20 mg/kg/10 s induces minimal cardiovascular depression at dosages in excess of the apneic dosage.
Respiratory depression and apnea should be expected as potential adverse effects after i.v. administration of propofol to dogs, particularly when administered at rapid rates of infusion.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in cancer cells. However, TRAIL is not toxic against most normal cells. We have accordingly examined by in vivo electroporation whether TRAIL induces apoptosis in renal cell carcinoma. In addition, combination treatment with TRAIL and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against renal cell carcinoma was also investigated. The NC65 renal cell carcinoma line was used as a target. pCAGGS TRAIL was injected into the NC65 tumors in the right flanks of severe combined immunodeficient mice. Tumors were pulsed with the CUY21 electroporator. Electroporation was done once on day 0 or thrice on days 0, 2, and 4. Apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay. When TRAIL gene therapy using in vivo i.t. electroporation was done once only, the growth of NC65 tumors was not inhibited. However, when TRAIL gene therapy was done thrice, growth suppression of the NC65 tumors was observed. Transfection of the TRAIL gene by in vivo electroporation induced apoptosis in NC65 tumors. When NC65 cells were treated with TRAIL gene therapy in combination with 5-FU, stronger growth suppression was obtained. TRAIL gene therapy did not induce liver dysfunction in severe combined immunodeficient mice. This study shows that TRAIL gene therapy induced growth suppression and apoptosis in NC65 tumors without severe side effects, and that combination treatment of NC65 cells with TRAIL gene therapy and 5-FU resulted in higher antitumor activity. These findings suggest that TRAIL gene therapy and/or 5-FU may be effective against renal cell carcinoma without harmful toxic effects.
Hck and Lyn are required in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Here, we present evidence that the promoter CpG island of Hck, but not of Lyn, is aberrantly methylated in leukemia. Hck promoter DNA methylation was detected in 13 out of 23 (56.5%) hematopoietic and eight out of 10 (80%) non-hematopoietic cell lines, but not in normal controls. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced demethylation and restoration of Hck mRNA and protein expression. Hck methylation (> or =15%) was detected in nine out of 44 (20%) patients with Ph negative ALL, and in one out 16 (6%) patients with Ph positive ALL, but not in patients with AML or chronic myelogenous leukemia. In this subset of patients, low levels of Hck methylation (10-15%) were observed in 26-30% of patients. Lyn methylation was observed in three out of 28 (10.7%) cell lines, but only in one out of 71 (1.4%) patients. Patients with Ph negative ALL and Hck methylation had a poorer prognosis. These data indicate that Hck may have tumor suppressor properties in BCR-ABL negative leukemia.
The routine use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 10 days during full-dose cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy in HIV-associated diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients is very expensive in developing countries. We treated 22 HIV-associated diffuse NHL patients with standard-dose CHOP and used G-CSF after an episode of febrile neutropenia until neutrophil count reached 1000/mm3. The clinical response was: complete response (36%), partial response (32%), stable disease (14%) and progression (18%). There were no toxicity-related deaths. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 16% of cycles, but only 8% were complicated with febrile neutropenia. Seventeen patients died (median survival 15 months; range 2-70). There are five patients alive (median survival 24+ months; range 17-36+). Our experience showed that we can treat HIV-related NHL patients with full-dose CHOP, achieve good responses and have an acceptable toxicity profile, with the use of G-CSF as needed.
The delta opioid system is involved in the behavioral effects of various drugs of abuse. However, only a few studies have focused on the possible interactions between the opioid system and the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). In order to examine the possible role of the delta opioid system in MDMA-induced behaviors in mice, locomotor activity and conditioned place preference (CPP) were investigated in the presence of naltrindole (NTI), a selective delta opioid antagonist. Moreover, the consequences of acute and chronic MDMA administration on pro-enkephalin (Penk) and pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) gene expression were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). The results showed that, after acute MDMA administration (9 mg/kg; i.p.), NTI (5 mg/kg, s.c.) was able to totally block MDMA-induced hyperlocomotion. Penk gene expression was not modulated by acute MDMA, but a decrease of Pomc gene expression was observed, which was not antagonized by NTI. Administration of the antagonist prevented the acquisition of MDMA-induced CPP, suggesting an implication of the delta opioid receptors in this behavior. Following chronic MDMA treatment, only the level of Pomc was modulated. The observed increase was totally blocked by NTI pre-treatment. All these results confirm the interactions between the delta opioid system (receptors and peptides) and the effects of MDMA.
The purpose of this study was to examine whether acute stress exposure would alter the ataxic properties of midazolam or ethanol in rats. Rats were administered either vehicle or FG 7142 (10 mg/kg) and placed back in their home cages, or placed in restraining tubes for 90 min. Three and one-half or 24 h following injection all subjects were then administered an ataxic dose of either ethanol or midazolam and after 10 min, motoric impairment was assessed by rotarod performance. Neither FG 7142 administration nor restraint had an impact on rotarod performance 3-1/2 h later for ethanol nor 24 h later in response to midazolam. However, midazolam-induced ataxia was significantly modified 3-1/2 h following both restraint and FG 7142 exposure. Similarly, at the 24-h time point, both manipulations had a significant effect on ethanol-induced motor incoordination. Importantly, prior exposure to FG 7142 and restraint was without effect on rotarod performance in saline-treated subjects. Functional alterations in behavioral reactivity to low doses of two classes of CNS depressants by the acute stress of restraint and/or FG 7142 administration suggest the anxiogenic nature of these stressors may be the critical factor.
Laropiprant (LRPT), a prostaglandin D2 receptor 1 antagonist shown to reduce niacin-induced flushing symptoms, is being developed in combination with niacin for the treatment of dyslipidemia. This study assessed the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of single-dose warfarin in the presence/absence of multiple-dose LRPT. Thirteen subjects received 2 treatments in random order separated by > or =10-day washout: (1) multiple-dose LRPT 40 mg/d for 12 days (days -5 to 7) with coadministered single-dose warfarin 30 mg (day 6) and (2) single-dose warfarin 30 mg (day 1). R+- and S(-)-warfarin and international normalized ratio (INR) were assayed predose and up to 168 hours postdose. Comparability was declared if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratio (GMR; warfarin + LRPT/warfarin alone) of area under the plasma concentration curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-infinity) for R+- and S(-)-warfarin were contained within (0.80, 1.25). The estimated GMRs of AUC0-infinity (90% CIs) were 1.02 (0.96, 1.09) and 1.04 (0.98, 1.09) for R+- and S(-)-warfarin, respectively. The estimated GMRs of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (90% CIs) were 1.13 (1.02, 1.26) and 1.11 (0.99, 1.24) for R+- and S(-)-warfarin, respectively. The estimated GMRs of area under the prothrombin time INR curve from 0 to 168 hours on day 21 (INR AUC0-168 h) and average maximum observed prothrombin time INR (INRmax) were 1.02 (0.99, 1.05) and 1.04 (0.98, 1.10), respectively. There was no evidence of clinically meaningful alterations in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ie, INR) of R(+)- or S(-)-warfarin after coadministration of multiple-dose LRPT and single-dose warfarin.
40 patients suffering from chronic urticaria were randomly treated with either Terfenadine or Astemizole. The treatment period was 8 days after a 4 day wash out phase with placebo. The intensity of the symptoms was quantified and daily recorded by the patients. Both antihistamines influenced significantly the intensity of the pruritus and the flares. With the used study design and dosage slight superiority of Astemizole over Terfenadine could be observed. Neither Astemizole nor Terfenadine showed sedation side effects. The average amount of the sedation symptom scores was during the therapy phase on the same level as during the placebo phase.
