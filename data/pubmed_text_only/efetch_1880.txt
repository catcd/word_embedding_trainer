Mecamylamine (Inversine), the first orally available antihypertensive agent, is now rarely used. Although celebrated in the 1950s, mecamylamine fell out of favour because of its widespread ganglionic side effects at antihypertensive doses (30-90 mg/day). However, recent studies suggest that mecamylamine is very effective at relatively low doses (2.5-5 mg b.i.d.) for blocking the physiological effects of nicotine and improving abstinence rates in smoking cessation studies, particularly for women. When these lower doses of mecamylamine are given, patients do not experience the severity of side effects that made the drug unpopular for the treatment of hypertension. Tobacco smoking is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity, including accelerated atherosclerosis and increased risk of heart attacks. Though currently untested, the available evidence suggests that low-dose mecamylamine therapy might reduce blood pressure variability and atherogenetic lipid profile in smokers. With this in mind, mecamylamine should be an important research tool in the field of hypertension research, particularly in recalcitrant smokers with mild to moderate hypertension.
Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) was diagnosed in a 54-year-old male, a chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier, in June, 1983. Prompt remission was achieved, and maintenance and intensification chemotherapy were given for five years. He was readmitted in March, 1988 because of a mass in the liver and was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Curative right segmentectomy was performed in May, 1988. In December, 1988, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder was discovered, and resected transurethrally. These secondary neoplasms, HCC and bladder cancer, were thought to be associated with the long-term chemotherapy given for the AML.
Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) lung has been shown to be associated with structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature, including medial and adventitial thickening. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mitogenic and permeability factor targeting predominantly endothelial cells. mRNA encoding VEGF is detected in all fetal tissues and is most abundant in fetal lung, kidney, and liver. Recently, antenatal dexamethasone (Dex) treatment has been shown to prevent pulmonary-artery structural changes in experimentally-produced CDH. The aim of this study was to investigate mRNA and protein levels of VEGF in CDH lung and to determine whether antenatal Dex treatment has any effect on the production of VEGF. A CDH model was induced in pregnant rats following administration of 100 mg nitrofen on days 9.5 of gestation (term=22 days). Dex 0.25 mg/kg was given on day 18.5 and 19.5. Cesarean section was performed on day 21 of gestation. The fetuses were divided into three groups: normal controls (NC, n=8); nitrofen-induced CDH (CDH, n=8); and nitrofen-induced CDH with antenatal Dex treatment (CDH-Dex, n=8). Protein and mRNA were extracted from the whole lung. VEGF protein was measured by ELISA assay and mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry using anti-rat VEGF antibody was also performed in each group. VEGF protein as well as mRNA expression were significantly increased in the CDH group compared to the NC group, which was not affected by antenatal Dex treatment. VEGF immunoreactivity in pulmonary vessel walls was increased in the CDH and CDH-Dex groups compared to the NC group. The enhanced VEGF protein and mRNA expression in CDH lung suggests that increased local synthesis of VEGF may be responsible for the structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature in CDH lung. VEGF expression in CDH lung is not downregulated by antenatal Dex treatment.
The authors report a patient with mild mental retardation, autistic features, multiple vertebral malformations, and an unusual facial appearance who carries a de novo submicroscopic deletion of chromosome 2p16.3. The patient's deletion is approximately 320 kb in size and includes only the part of the NRXN1 gene that codes for the neurexin1alpha promoter and initial coding exons. The more downstream neurexin1beta promoter and the region surrounding it are intact. Neurexin1beta has been associated with autism in several recent studies, but this is the first reported patient with loss of only neurexin1alpha and not of neurexin1beta. These findings suggest that neurexin1alpha function in correct dosage is necessary for normal neurological development.
During 1953-83 there were 48 admissions to the regional poisoning treatment centre, Edinburgh, for overdose of quinine including 19 since 1978. Six patients were blind and one had ventricular tachycardia. Stellate ganglion block was performed without benefit in seven patients. No patient died, but three deaths from cardiotoxicity occurred in a further 71 patients reported to the Scottish Poisons Information Bureau. Plasma quinine concentration related to time from ingestion was found to be a useful predictor of visual toxicity.
The prepiriform cortex (PPCx) shows high sensitivity to the epileptogenic action of chemo-convulsants and to the protective action of the NMDA receptor antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoate (APH) against pilocarpine-induced (motor) limbic seizures in rats. In this study the interaction between agonists acting selectively on the three main excitatory amino acid receptor subtypes in the PPCx and the muscarinic agonist, pilocarpine, within the PPCx have been investigated. Kainate (KA) or quisqualate (QUIS) injected focally into the PPCx (100 pmoles or 5 nmoles per side respectively) induced motor limbic seizures when administered after a subconvulsant dose of pilocarpine (250 mg/kg, i.p.). KA, 100 pmoles injected into the same site in olfactory-bulboectomized rats (bulbectomy results in protection against pilocarpine-induced seizures) also facilitated seizures. However, activation of the NMDA receptor in the PPCx by focal injection of NMDA (250 fmoles-10 nmoles) failed to produce seizures after a subconvulsant dose of pilocarpine. Moreover NMDA in the same range of doses injected into the PPCx protected rats against the seizures induced by a fully convulsant dose of pilocarpine.
Despite recent advances in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), early mortality and relapses still occur. With the view to evaluate the role of FLT3 mutation in APL, 54 patients (median age 28 years, range11-57 years, male to female ratio 1.2:1, median TLC 8.4 x 10(9)/l, range 1-170 x 10(9)/l) were studied by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Forty-two patients (77%) achieved first remission (CR1). Ten (18.5%) of the 54 patients had internal tandem duplication of exons 11 and 12 of the FLT3 gene. The median TLC count was significantly higher in FLT3 positive cases (Median TLC 55.0 x 10(9)/l) as compared to FLT3 negative cases (Median TLC 6.8 x 10(9)/l) (p = 0.001). Induction CR was much lower (40%) in FLT3/ITD positive cases as compared to 86% of FLT3/ITD negative cases (p = 0.005). Early deaths too were significantly associated with FLT3/ITD positive cases (50 vs. 16% p = 0.033). The difference in the occurrence of bcr1 and bcr3 isoforms was not statistically significant between the two groups. The data suggest that the presence of FLT3/ITD in APL patients confers a poor prognosis.
The prokinetic drug cisapride is widely used for treating gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants and children. As in the Netherlands it is not officially registered for use in these age groups, prescribing doctors have problems obtaining adequate information on proper use and side effects. In the treatment of pediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux with cisapride the major recommendations include not to exceed the maximum dose of 0.2 mg/kg four times daily, to avoid comedication with imidazoles and macrolides and to check the QTc interval in patients with known risk factors for QTc prolongation.
The human HD domain protein SAMHD1 is implicated in the Aicardi-Goutières autoimmune syndrome and in the restriction of HIV-1 replication in myeloid cells. Recently, this protein has been shown to possess dNTP triphosphatase activity, which is proposed to inhibit HIV-1 replication and the autoimmune response by hydrolyzing cellular dNTPs. Here, we show that the purified full-length human SAMHD1 protein also possesses metal-dependent 3'→5' exonuclease activity against single-stranded DNAs and RNAs in vitro. In double-stranded substrates, this protein preferentially cleaved 3'-overhangs and RNA in blunt-ended DNA/RNA duplexes. Full-length SAMHD1 also exhibited strong DNA and RNA binding to substrates with complex secondary structures. Both nuclease and dNTP triphosphatase activities of SAMHD1 are associated with its HD domain, but the SAM domain is required for maximal activity and nucleic acid binding. The nuclease activity of SAMHD1 could represent an additional mechanism contributing to HIV-1 restriction and suppression of the autoimmune response through direct cleavage of viral and endogenous nucleic acids. In addition, we demonstrated the presence of dGTP triphosphohydrolase and nuclease activities in several microbial HD domain proteins, suggesting that these proteins might contribute to antiviral defense in prokaryotes.
Dopamine (DA) D3 and D2 receptor mechanisms are implicated in cocaine's abuse-related behavioral effects, but the relative contribution of the two receptor subtypes is only partially characterized. This study investigated the role of D3 and D2 subtype mechanisms by determining the degree to which the D3-preferring antagonist PG01037 [N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin- 1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide HCl] and the D2-preferring antagonist L-741626 [3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4- hydroxypiperidin-1-yl]methyl-1H-indole] attenuated several behavioral effects of cocaine in squirrel monkeys. Quantitative observational studies established doses of each antagonist that did not produce untoward effects, which were used in subsequent comparisons. In addition, the ability of the D3-preferring agonist PD128907 [(R-(+)-trans-3,4a,10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano[4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol)] and the D2-preferring agonist sumanirole [(R)-5,6-dihydro-5-(methylamino)-4H- imidazo[4,5,1-ij]quinolin-2(1H)-one(Z)-2-butenedioate] to reproduce cocaine's discriminative stimulus (DS) and priming effects were compared. In monkeys trained to discriminate cocaine from vehicle, both DA antagonists attenuated and both DA agonists partially reproduced cocaine's DS effects. PG01037 also selectively attenuated the cocaine-like DS effects of PD128907, whereas L-741626 attenuated the cocaine-like DS effects of both agonists. In self-administration studies, L-741626 nonselectively reduced cocaine- and food-maintained responding, whereas PG01037 was ineffective against either reinforcer. In studies involving reinstatement of extinguished cocaine seeking, both antagonists attenuated cocaine-induced reinstatement of responding, and both agonists induced at least partial reinstatement of cocaine seeking. L-741626 also attenuated sumanirole-induced, but not PD128907-induced, reinstatement of responding, whereas PG01037 was ineffective against either DA agonist. The results are consistent with a role for D3 and D2 receptor mechanisms in cocaine's DS effects and cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking, but provide no evidence for a major role of D3 receptors in the direct reinforcing effects of cocaine.
Angiotensin II is an important oxidative stress mediator. Our previous studies have indicated that the potent antioxidative properties of acetylsalicylic acid play an important role in its cardiovascular protective effects. There are some ongoing controversies concerning the use of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors rofecoxib and nimesulide possess antioxidative and cardiovascular protective effects against angiotensin II. Chronic subcutaneous angiotensin II infusion increased cardiovascular but not colonic tissue superoxide production, heart/body weight ratio, and blood pressure. Moreover, angiotensin II selectively increased cardiac cyclooxygenase-2 but not cyclooxygenase-1 expression, which was totally prevented by acetylsalicylic acid treatment. Similar to acetylsalicylic acid, rofecoxib or nimesulide treatments significantly attenuated angiotensin II-induced oxidative stress, hypertension, and cardiac NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p47(phox) expression. Rofecoxib also reduced cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with nonselective anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen, indomethacin, or salicylic acid did not show any effect on angiotensin II-induced superoxide production, hypertension, or cardiac hypertrophy. Although acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid inhibited angiotensin II-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, nimesulide did not modify NF-kappaB activation. In conclusion, cyclooxygenase-2 pathway is implicated in angiotensin II-induced oxidative stress and deleterious cardiovascular changes. Rofecoxib and nimesulide produced significant antioxidative effect by reducing NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent superoxide generation. These effects seem to be independent of NF-kappaB inhibition.
Imatinib has now been in use for almost 10 years. Despite this cumulative experience, little is known about its effects on pregnancy; as a result, there are few published data to facilitate the counseling of women who conceive while taking imatinib. The results we now present provide information which may be of use in such circumstances. Of 180 women exposed to imatinib during pregnancy, outcome data are available for 125 (69%). Of those with known outcomes, 50% delivered normal infants and 28% underwent elective terminations, 3 following the identification of abnormalities. There were a total of 12 infants in whom abnormalities were identified, 3 of which had strikingly similar complex malformations that are clearly a cause for concern. It appears that although most pregnancies exposed to imatinib are likely to have a successful outcome, there remains a risk that exposure may result in serious fetal malformations.
Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH, pseudotumour cerebri) is a rare condition with unknown aetiology although hormonal influences have been implicated. It occurs spontaneously, particularly in young obese women, and is associated with several drug treatments including corticosteroids. Two young adult women are described in whom headache and papilloedema in association with raised intracranial pressure occurred during prednisolone treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. This provides further evidence of the risk of BIH during corticosteroid treatment and has not been described before in adults with this condition. Advice is given to gastroenterologists to use corticosteroids with caution in adults, particularly young, fertile female patients. The treatment of a severe relapse of colitis in a patient who has had one episode of steroid related BIH remains a dilemma.
We aimed to investigate the role of a probiotic mixture, including 13 different bacteria, in the prevention of aspirin-induced gastric mucosal injury.
Forty rats were allocated into 4 groups: normal control, aspirin, probiotic control, and probiotic plus aspirin. Normal control and aspirin groups received 0.2 ml of skim milk by daily gavage for 14 days. Probiotic control and probiotic plus aspirin groups were administered 0.2 ml/day of probiotic mixture (1.3 x 10(10) cfu/ml) suspended in skim milk by daily gavage for 14 days. On day 15, gastric lesions were induced by administration of aspirin (200 mg/kg) in the aspirin and probiotic plus aspirin groups. Normal control and probiotic control groups were given saline.
Pretreatment with probiotic mixture reduced aspirin-induced gastric damage scores (4.50 ± 0.43 and 2.60 ± 0.40, p<0.01) and exerted tendency of downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines elicited by aspirin (p>0.05). We also found that the probiotic mixture increased sIgA production approximately 7.5-fold in the stomach, and significantly reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) increase in the gastric mucosa elicited by aspirin (p<0.001). Additionally, pretreatment with the probiotic mixture alleviated aspirin-induced reduction of mast cell count in the gastric mucosa.
Probiotic mixture pretreatment attenuates the aspirin-induced gastric lesions by reducing the lipid peroxidation, enhancing mucosal sIgA production, and stabilizing mucosal mast cell degranulation into the gastric mucosa.
Pretreatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a precursor of 5-HT, antagonised while pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), a 5-HT depletor, potentiated the myoclonus induced by picrotoxin, a GABA antagonist. Pretreatment with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a GABA transaminase inhibitor, antagonised picrotoxin-induced myoclonus. The combined effect of the least protective doses of AOAA and 5-HTP was greater than the sum of their individual inhibitory effects on picrotoxin-induced myoclonus. Further, AOAA failed to inhibit picrotoxin-induced myoclonus in PCPA pretreated rats. These findings suggest that the central 5-HT-ergic system exerts a facilitatory influence on the GABA-ergic system and thus it is involved in the antimyoclonic action of GABA.
Alterations in malaoxon-(MO)-induced brain regional phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and in brain calcium levels were studied in female non-pregnant and pregnant rats, and in their offspring. The adult rats were followed for 1 or 4 h after MO for tonic-clonic convulsions. A dose of 8.2 mg kg-1 of MO caused similar convulsions in 74% of the pregnant rats as we have reported in young male rats with a dose of 39.2 mg kg-1. However, convulsions did not occur in non-pregnant female rats. Inositol and inositol monophosphate levels were similar in all control rats. MO decreased brain inositol both in pregnant and non-pregnant female rats, and in the cerebellum of the offspring. In contrast to the findings in male rats, MO only randomly increased brain inositol-1-phosphate in female rats, or in their offspring. However, cerebral inositol-4-phosphate levels were similarly increased both in the non-pregnant and the pregnant rats irrespectively of convulsions. MO did not elevate cerebral Ca2+ in female rats or their offspring, in contrast to the male rats. The present results suggest that female rats are more sensitive than male rats to MO-induced PI signalling, and during pregnancy, also to MO-induced overt convulsions, but not to changes in cerebral Ca2+.
We made a double-blind, crossover comparison of buspirone (10 mg orally, twice a day) and placebo in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The duration of the study was 3 weeks, for both buspirone and for placebo treatment. Chronic therapies remained unchanged. The extrapyramidal symptoms, dyskinesias, and anxious/depressive symptoms were evaluated at the beginning of the study and after the buspirone and placebo treatments. Seven patients concluded the trial. The extrapyramidal symptoms, evaluated in both the "off" and "on" states during an oral L-Dopa test, did not show any worsening during the trial. Buspirone significantly lessened the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in five of the seven patients, whereas it proved ineffective in the two patients with the mildest dyskinesias. There were no changes in the mild anxious and depressive symptoms at any time during the study. The activities of buspirone on the serotonin and dopamine systems might have led to the antidyskinetic effect we observed. At daily dosages of 20 mg, buspirone might prove effective in reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesias without worsening of parkinsonism.
The study describes a rare case of arthromyopathy from phenobarbital which affected the right hand of a patient. The case is particularly interesting since symptoms developed after the drug had been taken for only one month.
Genetic variability in the renin-angiotensin system may modify renal responses to injury and disease progression. We examined whether the M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, and the A1166--> C polymorphism of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene may be associated with disease progression in 168 Caucasian patients with IgA nephropathy. All patients had serial measurements of their creatinine clearance, proteinuria, and blood pressure (mean+/-SD) with a follow-up of 6.1+/-4.7 yr. The genotype frequencies for each gene were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and were similar to those of 100 Caucasian control subjects. We examined two primary outcomes: (a) the rate of deterioration of Ccr, and (b) the maximal level of proteinuria. We found that patients with the AGT MT (n = 79) and TT (n = 29) genotypes had a faster rate of deterioration of Ccr than those with the MM (n = 60) genotype (i.e., median values, -6.6 and -6.2 vs. -3. 0 ml/min/yr, respectively; P = 0.01 by Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly, patients with AGT MT and TT genotypes had higher maximal values of proteinuria than those with the MM genotype (i.e., median values, 2.5 and 3.5 vs. 2.0 g/d, respectively; P < 0.02 by Kruskal-Wallis test). Neither the ACE insertion/deletion nor angiotensin II type I A1166--> C gene polymorphism was associated with disease progression or proteinuria in univariate analysis. Multivariant analysis, however, detected an interaction between the AGT and ACE gene polymorphisms with the presence of ACE/DD polymorphism adversely affecting disease progression only in patients with the AGT/MM genotype (P = 0.008). Neither of these gene polymorphisms was associated with systemic hypertension. Our results suggest that polymorphisms at the AGT and ACE gene loci are important markers for predicting progression to chronic renal failure in Caucasian patients with IgA nephropathy.
The cell surface glycoprotein E-cadherin (CDH1) is a key regulator of adhesive properties in epithelial cells. Germline mutations in CDH1 are well established as the defects underlying hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome, and an increased risk of lobular breast cancer (LBC) has been described in HDGC kindreds. However, germline CDH1 mutations have not been described in patients with LBC in non-HDGC families. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of germline CDH1 mutations in patients with LBC with early onset disease or family histories of breast cancer without DGC.
Germline DNA was analysed in 23 women with invasive lobular or mixed ductal and lobular breast cancers who had at least one close relative with breast cancer or had themselves been diagnosed before the age of 45 years, had tested negative for a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, and reported no personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer. The full coding sequence of CDH1 including splice junctions was amplified using PCR and screened for mutations using DHPLC and sequencing.
A novel germline CDH1 truncating mutation in the extracellular portion of the protein (517insA) was identified in one woman who had LBC at the age of 42 years and a first degree relative with invasive LBC.
Germline CDH1 mutations can be associated with invasive LBC in the absence of diffuse gastric cancer. The finding, if confirmed, may have implications for management of individuals at risk for this breast cancer subtype. Clarification of the cancer risks in the syndrome is essential.
Early attempts to develop an animal model for anti-motion sickness drugs, using dogs and cats; were unsuccessful. Dogs did not show a beneficial effect of scopolamine (probably the best single anti-motion sickness drug for humans thus far) and the findings in cats were not definitive. The authors have developed an animal model using the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) of the Bolivian phenotype. Unrestrained monkeys in a small lucite cage were tested in an apparatus that induces motion sickness by combining vertical oscillation and horizontal rotation in a visually unrestricted laboratory environment. Signs of motion sickness were scored using a rating scale. Ten susceptible monkeys (weighing 800-1000 g) were given a total of five tests each, to establish the baseline susceptibility level. Based on the anticholinergic activity of scopolamine, the sensitivity of squirrel monkey to scopolamine was investigated, and the appropriate dose of scopolamine for this species was determined. Then various anti-motion sickness preparations were administered in subsequent tests: 100 ug scopolamine per monkey; 140 ug dexedrine; 50 ug scopolamine plus 70 ug dexedrine; 100 ug scopolamine plus 140 ug dexedrine; 3 mg promethazine; 3 mg promethazine plus 3 mg ephedrine. All these preparations were significantly effective in preventing motion sickness in the monkeys. Ephedrine, by itself, which is marginally effective in humans, was ineffective in the monkeys at the doses tried (0.3-6.0 mg). The squirrel monkey appears to be a good animal model for antimotion sickness drugs. Peripherally acting antihistamines such as astemizole and terfenadine were found to be ineffective, whereas flunarizine, and an arginine vasopressin V1 antagonist, showed significant activity in preventing motion sickness.
MR of the brain was performed in eight patients (mean age, 14.9 years) with osteogenic sarcoma during or after IV treatment with high-dose methotrexate. MR detected brain abnormalities in four patients, three of whom had concomitant neurologic dysfunction. Pathologic findings demonstrated on MR were (1) chronic brain edema, demonstrable over a period of 3-14 months (proved by autopsy in one patient); (2) multifocal white matter necrosis; and (3) deep brain atrophy. MR appears to be valuable in the detection of abnormalities induced by treatment with high-dose methotrexate.
In a previous study, we showed that (1'S)-acetoxychavicol acetate ((S)-ACA) caused a rapid decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels less than 15 min after exposure. (S)-ACA-induced cell death was reversed by the addition of N-acetylcysteine. In the current study, we investigated the inhibitory activities of 13 derivatives of (S)-ACA on tumor cell viability, intracellular GSH level and GR activity. Correlations were found among a decrease in cell viability, intracellular GSH levels and the activity of GR in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells treated with the various ACA analogues. A test of the 13 derivatives revealed that the structural factors regulating activity were as follows: (1) the para or 1'-position of acetoxyl group (or other acyl group) was essential, (2) the presence of a C2'-C3' double or triple bond was essential, and (3) the S configuration of the 1'-acetoxyl group was preferable.
Current oxime therapies do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier to reactivate organophosphorus nerve agent-inhibited cholinesterase (ChE) within the CNS. We investigated the ability of monoisonitrosoacetone (MINA), a tertiary oxime, to reactivate ChE inhibited by the nerve agent sarin (GB), cyclosarin (GF), or VX, in peripheral tissues and brain of guinea pigs and determined whether reactivation in the CNS will enhance protection against the lethal effects of these three agents. In the reactivation experiment, animals were pretreated with atropine methylnitrate (1.0mg/kg, i.m.) 15 min prior to subcutaneous (s.c.) challenge with 1.0 x LD(50) of GB, GF, or VX. Fifteen minutes later animals were treated intramuscularly (i.m.) with MINA (ranging from 22.1 to 139.3mg/kg) or 2-PAM (25.0mg/kg). At 60 min after nerve agent, CNS (brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, spinal cord, and striatum) and peripheral (blood, diaphragm, heart, and skeletal muscle) tissues were collected for ChE analysis. MINA reactivated nerve agent-inhibited ChE in the CNS and peripheral tissues in a dose-dependent manner in the following order of potency: GB>GF>VX. In a survival experiment, animals were injected i.m. with atropine sulfate (0.5mg/kg), 2-PAM (25.0mg/kg), or MINA (35.0, 60.0, or 100.0mg/kg) alone or in combination 1 min after challenge with varying s.c. doses of GB, GF, or VX to determine the level of protection. The rank order of MINA's efficacy in guinea pigs against nerve agent lethality was the same as for reactivation of inhibited ChE in the CNS. These data show that MINA is capable of reactivating nerve agent-inhibited ChE and that the extent of ChE reactivation within the CNS strongly relates to its therapeutic efficacy.
Exposure to 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal pathway and nicotine and caffeine ameliorate neurodegenerative changes in MPTP-lesioned mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of nicotine and caffeine on the expression patterns of genes in the striatum of control and MPTP-treated mice to identify the differentially expressed transcripts and to assess their possible implications in neuroprotection. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with caffeine (20mg/kg) or nicotine (1mg/kg), daily, for the first 8 weeks followed by MPTP (20mg/kg) co-treatment for further 4 weeks along with respective controls. RNA was isolated from the striatum of control and treated mice; reverse transcribed separately into labeled cDNA and a mixture of equal quantities of labeled cDNA was hybridized with mouse 15k array. The expression levels of toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein, nuclear protein-1, cathepsin B, interleukin-4 receptor, caspase 9, complement component-1, heat shock protein-1 and cytochrome c-oxidase-VIIc were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MPTP differentially regulated the expression of many genes involved in apoptotic cell death, oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, protein modification and mitochondrial dysfunction. The expression patterns of many of these transcripts were significantly restored in caffeine- and nicotine-treated mice. The results demonstrate the involvement of multiple molecular events in MPTP-induced toxicity and nicotine or caffeine-mediated neuroprotection.
