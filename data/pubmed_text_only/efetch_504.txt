Compounds possessing 5-HT(1A) agonist properties attenuate catalepsy induced by D(2) receptor blockade. Here we examined the role of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonism in the reduced cataleptogenic potential of several novel antipsychotic agents in the crossed leg position (CLP) and the bar catalepsy tests in rats. When administered alone, ziprasidone produced marked catalepsy, whereas aripiprazole, bifeprunox, SLV313, SSR181507 and sarizotan did not. However, when 5-HT(1A) receptors were blocked with the selective antagonist, WAY100635 (0.63 mg/kg, SC), robust cataleptogenic properties of SLV313, bifeprunox and sarizotan were unmasked and the catalepsy induced by ziprasidone was accentuated. In contrast, only modest catalepsy was induced by aripiprazole and SSR181507, even following a higher dose of WAY100635 (2.5 mg/kg). This suggests that these compounds possess other anti-cataleptic properties, such as partial agonism at dopamine D(2) receptors. The capacity to reverse neuroleptic-induced catalepsy was investigated in interaction studies with haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg, SC). Whereas ziprasidone and aripiprazole did not markedly reduce the effects of haloperidol, SLV313 and sarizotan attenuated CLP catalepsy. In contrast, SSR181507 and bifeprunox potently inhibited both CLP and bar catalepsy. Taken together, these data show that 5-HT(1A) receptor activation reduces the cataleptogenic potential of novel antipsychotic agents but indicate marked diversity in the contribution of 5-HT(1A) and/or other mechanisms to the profiles of the drugs.
To evaluate the potential inhibitory effect of theophylline on the pulmonary oxidative stress in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we concomitantly measured the blood levels of theophylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor and lipid peroxides as an index of oxidative stress. The plasma levels of lipid peroxides were significantly elevated in patients with asthma (3.48 +/- 0.11 nmol ml(-1); mean +/- SEM; n=21, P<0.01), non- or ex-smoking patients with COPD (3.55 +/- 0.11 nmol ml(-1); n = 20, P<0.01), and current-smoking patients with COPD (3.53 +/- 0.15 nmol ml(-1); n = 15, P<0.01), respectively, as compared to those of non-smoking controls (3.02 +/- 0.08 nmol ml(-1); n = 19). There was a significant negative correlation between the plasma level of lipid peroxides and the forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)% of forced vital capacity in these subjects (r = -0.304; n = 75, P < 0.01). In asthmatics, there was a significant negative correlation between the plasma level of lipid peroxides and the serum level of theophylline (r = -0.495; n = 18, P<0.05). These results suggest that there may be increased oxidative stress in patients with asthma and COPD, and indicate that oxidative stress could possibly attribute to the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD in leading to airflow obstruction and that theophylline could potentially inhibit oxidative stress in the process of bronchopulmonary inflammation in asthmatics.
We evaluated the protective effect of interleukin-10 (IL-10) against murine gut-derived sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gut-derived sepsis was induced by administering cyclophosphamide and ampicillin while feeding P. aeruginosa to specific-pathogen-free mice. Treating mice with recombinant human IL-10 (rhIL-10) at 1.0 or 5.0 microg/mouse twice a day following the second cyclophosphamide administration significantly increased the survival rate compared to that of control mice treated with saline; however, treatment with rhIL-10 at 0.1 microg/mouse did not result in significant protection. Bacterial counts in the liver, spleen, and blood were all significantly lower in mice treated with rhIL-10 than in saline-treated control mice. Treatment with rhIL-10 significantly suppressed tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and gamma interferon levels in the serum of mice following induction of gut-derived sepsis. We also studied the effect of IL-10 on leukocyte recovery after cyclophosphamide treatment of mice. Administration of rhIL-10 intraperitoneally at 1. 0 microg/mouse significantly accelerated the recovery of leukocytes in comparison with that of the group of saline-treated controls. These results indicate that IL-10 shows a protective effect against gut-derived P. aeruginosa sepsis. We suspect that the mechanism of this effect is that IL-10 regulates in vivo production of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, acceleration of leukocyte recovery by IL-10 after cyclophosphamide-induced depression may also play an important role in this protection.
Progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH) is a rare, disabling disease of heterotopic ossification (HO) that progresses from skin and subcutaneous tissues into deep skeletal muscle. POH occurs in the absence of multiple developmental features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) or hormone resistance, clinical manifestations that are also associated with GNAS inactivation. However, occasional patients with AHO and pseudohypoparathyroidism 1a/c (PHP1a/c; AHO features plus hormone resistance) have also been described who have progressive HO. This study was undertaken to define the diagnostic and mutational spectrum of POH and progressive disorders of HO, and to distinguish them from related disorders in which HO remains confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. We reviewed the charts of 111 individuals who had cutaneous and subcutaneous ossification. All patients were assessed for eight characteristics: age of onset of HO, presence and location of HO, depth of HO, type of HO, progression of HO, features of AHO, PTH resistance, and GNAS mutation analysis. We found, based on clinical criteria, that POH and progressive HO syndromes are at the severe end of a phenotypic spectrum of GNAS-inactivating conditions associated with extra-skeletal ossification. While most individuals with superficial or progressive ossification had mutations in GNAS, there were no specific genotype-phenotype correlations that distinguished the more progressive forms of HO (e.g., POH) from the non-progressive forms (osteoma cutis, AHO, and PHP1a/c).
Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic cardiomyopathy. To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for cardiac damage due to doxorubicin, a cohort study was performed using dobutamine infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood cancer treated with doxorubicin from healthy control subjects. Echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients (mean age 16 +/- 5 years) treated from 1.6 to 14.3 years (median 5.3) before this study with 27 to 532 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (mean 196) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age-matched control subjects. Graded dobutamine infusions of 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg per min were administered. Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate. Dobutamine infusion at 10 micrograms/kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50% incidence rate of adverse symptoms. The most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects, end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in doxorubicin-treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with dobutamine stimulation. End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the doxorubicin-treated group was 11 +/- 1.9 mm versus 13.1 +/- 1.5 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01). End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5-micrograms/kg per min dobutamine infusion for the doxorubicin-treated group was 14.1 +/- 2.4 mm versus 19.3 +/- 2.6 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Although intrathecal clonidine produces pronounced analgesia, antinociceptive doses of intrathecal clonidine produce several side effects, including hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. Intrathecal tizanidine, another alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, has provided antinociception without producing pronounced hemodynamic changes in animal studies. However, it has been unclear whether antihyperalgesic doses of intrathecal clonidine and tizanidine produce hypotension and bradycardia in a neuropathic pain state. This study was designed to evaluate the antihyperalgesic effects and side effects of intrathecal clonidine and tizanidine in a rat model of neuropathic pain.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically implanted with lumbar intrathecal catheters, and the sciatic nerve was loosely ligated. After 21-28 days after surgery, the rats received intrathecal clonidine (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 microg) and tizanidine (1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 microg), and the antihyperalgesic effects of thermal and mechanical stimuli were examined. In addition, the changes in blood pressure and heart rate, sedation level, and other side effects after intrathecal administration of drugs were recorded.
The administration of 3.0 microg intrathecal clonidine or 5.0 microg tizanidine significantly reversed both thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. The administration of 3.0 microg intrathecal clonidine, but not 5.0 microg tizanidine, significantly decreased mean blood pressure and heart rate and produced urinary voiding. A greater sedative effect was produced by 3.0 microg intrathecal clonidine than by 5.0 microg tizanidine.
The antihyperalgesic dose of intrathecal clonidine and the antinociceptive doses produced several side effects. Intrathecal tizanidine at the dose that reversed hyperalgesia would be preferable for neuropathic pain management because of absence of hypotension and bradycardia and lower incidence of sedation.
A 31-year-old black man was admitted with an acute anterior myocardial infarction 20 minutes after IV cocaine abuse. Cardiac catheterization showed a totally occluded left anterior descending artery. Intracoronary and intravenous streptokinase resulted in thrombolysis: repeat angiography showed a normal anterior descending.
After 10 mg nicardipine IV a patient with stable angina developed chest pain and ST-segment depression accompanied by excessive tachycardia, low arterial blood pressure, and initially decreased coronary sinus blood flow. Measurements of arterial concentrations and cardiac exchanges of lactate, glucose, free fatty acids, glutamate, and alanine showed alterations indicative of severe ischemia.
Although stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor increases levels of cAMP and activation of the cAMP response element (CRE) in cardiac myocytes, the role of the signaling mechanism regulated by cAMP in hypertrophy and apoptosis is not well understood. In this study we show that protein expression of inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), an endogenous inhibitor of CRE-mediated transcription, is induced by stimulation of isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenergic agonist with a peak at approximately 12 hours and persisting for more than 24 hours in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. ICER is also upregulated by phenylephrine but not by endothelin-1. Continuous infusion of ISO also increased ICER in the rat heart in vivo. Overexpression of ICER significantly attenuated ISO- and phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy but did not inhibit endothelin-1-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Overexpression of ICER also stimulated cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Antisense inhibition of ICER significantly enhanced beta-adrenergic hypertrophy, whereas it significantly inhibited beta-adrenergic cardiac myocyte apoptosis, suggesting that endogenous ICER works as an important regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. Inhibition of CRE-mediated transcription by dominant-negative CRE binding protein inhibited cardiac hypertrophy, whereas it stimulated cardiac myocyte apoptosis, thereby mimicking the effect of ICER. Both ISO and ICER reduced expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic molecule, whereas antisense ICER prevented ISO-induced downregulation of Bcl-2. These results suggest that ICER is upregulated by cardiac hypertrophic stimuli increasing CRE-mediated transcription in cardiac myocytes and acts as a negative regulator of hypertrophy and a positive mediator of apoptosis, in part through both inhibition of CRE-mediated transcription and downregulation of Bcl-2.
Risk for developing a learning disability (LD) or impaired intellectual functioning by age 7 was assessed in full-term children with prenatal cocaine exposure drawn from a cohort of 476 children born full term and enrolled prospectively at birth. Intellectual functioning was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (Wechsler, 1991) short form, and academic functioning was assessed using the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT; Wechsler, 1993) Screener by examiners blind to exposure status. LDs were categorized based on ability-achievement discrepancy scores, using the regression-based predicted achievement method described in the WIAT manual. The sample in this report included 409 children (212 cocaine-exposed, 197 non-cocaine-exposed) from the birth cohort with available data. Cumulative incidence proportions and relative risk values were estimated using STATA software (Statacorp, 2003). No differences were found in the estimate of relative risk for impaired intellectual functioning (IQ below 70) between children with and without prenatal cocaine exposure (estimated relative risk = .95; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65, 1.39; p = .79). The cocaine-exposed children had 2.8 times greater risk of developing a LD by age 7 than non-cocaine-exposed children (95% CI = 1.05, 7.67; p = .038; IQ >/= 70 cutoff). Results remained stable with adjustment for multiple child and caregiver covariates, suggesting that children with prenatal cocaine exposure are at increased risk for developing a learning disability by age 7 when compared to their non-cocaine-exposed peers.
Excitatory amino acid transmission within mesocorticolimbic brain pathways is thought to play an important role in behavioural sensitization to psychomotor stimulants. The current studies evaluated a time course of the effects of cocaine on extracellular glutamate levels within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) following increasing periods of withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent stereotaxic surgeries and were pretreated daily with saline (1 mL/kg/day x 4 days, i.p.) or cocaine (15 mg/kg/day x 4 days, i.p.) and withdrawn for 1, 7 or 30 days. After withdrawal rats were challenged with the same dose of saline or cocaine and in vivo microdialysis of the mPFC was conducted with concurrent analysis of locomotor activity. Animals that were withdrawn from repeated daily cocaine for 1 day and 7 days displayed an augmentation in cocaine-induced mPFC glutamate levels compared to saline and acute control subjects, which were similarly unaffected by cocaine challenge. At the 7 day time point, a subset of animals that received repeated cocaine did not express behavioural sensitization, nor did these animals exhibit the enhancement in mPFC glutamate in response to cocaine challenge. In contrast to these early effects, 30 days of withdrawal resulted in no significant changes in cocaine-induced mPFC glutamate levels regardless of the pretreatment or behavioural response. These data suggest that repeated cocaine administration transiently increases cocaine-induced glutamate levels in the mPFC during the first week of withdrawal, which may play an important role in the development of behavioural sensitization to cocaine.
Combining strains to generate mutant mice may obscure conclusions regarding the targeted gene. Specifically, cocaine may have reduced reinforcing effects in 129 substrains compared to the C57BL/6 strain, commonly used for ES cells and breeding, respectively.
We tested the hypothesis that reinforcing effects of cocaine differ between the C57BL/6J strain and two substrains of 129, 129X1/SvJ and 129S6/SvEvTac.
To assess and reduce performance differences, operant responding was established with liquid food as a reinforcer and evaluated under fixed and progressive ratio schedules. Dose-effect functions for intravenous cocaine self-administration were then determined under both schedules. Finally, reinforced and nonreinforced manipulanda were reversed to assess acquisition of self-administration using a previously nonreinforced response.
Relative to C57BL/6J mice, 129X1/SvJ mice showed decreased reinforcing effects of low-magnitude food and cocaine reinforcers. Dose-effect functions for cocaine self-administration were comparable between C57BL/6J and 129S6/SvEvTac mice, despite delayed acquisition of operant behaviors and rightward shifts in the food concentration-effect functions in 129S6/SvEvTac mice. A high cocaine dose clearly served as a positive reinforcer in all three strains in a reversal procedure.
Relative to C57BL/6J mice, the reinforcing effects of cocaine were diminished in 129X1/SvJ mice, but only for low cocaine doses, and a similar profile was observed with food reinforcement. 129S6/SvEvTac mice required more extensive operant training than C57BL/6J mice did, but after acquisition, reinforcing effects of cocaine were similar in the two strains. We suggest that comparable phenotypes observed in gene-targeting studies may result from genetic background, whereas more profound or qualitatively different phenotypes may be more confidently attributed to targeted mutations.
In two female patients of 62 and 81 years old, a metabolic encephalopathy was diagnosed which was ascribed to the use of valproic acid. Both had elevated ammonia levels in arterial blood, without hepatic failure. The first patient eventually became comatose and required artificial ventilation. After discontinuation of the valproic acid and with the aid of supportive measures, both women recovered. In patients with an impaired level of consciousness who are using valproic acid, a metabolic encephalopathy caused by this drug should be considered. Elevated levels of ammonia can be found but are not mandatory. Discontinuation of valproic acid will lead to recovery of consciousness.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative morphine-sparing effects and reduction in pain and secondary mechanical hyperalgesia after preincisional or postincisional epidural administration of a local anesthetic and an opioid compared with a sham epidural control.
Patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery by laparotomy were randomly assigned to three groups and studied in a double-blinded manner. Group 1 received epidural lidocaine and fentanyl before incision and epidural saline 40 min after incision. Group 2 received epidural saline before incision and epidural lidocaine and fentanyl 40 min after incision. Group 3 received a sham epidural control (with saline injected into a catheter taped to the back) before and 40 min after incision. All patients underwent surgery with general anesthesia.
One hundred forty-one patients completed the study (group 1, n = 45; group 2, n = 49; group 3, n = 47). Cumulative patient-controlled analgesia morphine consumption at 48 h was significantly lower (P = 0.04) in group 1 (89.8 +/- 43.3 mg) than group 3 (112.5 +/- 71.5 mg) but not group 2 (95.4 +/- 60.2 mg), although the hourly rate of morphine consumption between 24 and 48 h after surgery was significantly lower (P < 0.0009) in group 1 (1.25 +/- 0.02 mg/h) than group 2 (1.41 +/- 0.02 mg/h). Twenty-four hours after surgery, the visual analog scale pain score on movement was significantly less intense (P = 0.005) in group 1 (4.9 +/- 2.2 cm) than group 3 (6.0 +/- 2.6 cm) but not group 2 (5.3 +/- 2.5 cm), and the von Frey pain threshold near the wound was significantly higher (P = 0.03) in group 1 (6.4 +/- 0.6 log mg) than in group 3 (6.1 +/- 0.8 log mg) but not group 2 (6.2 +/- 0.7 log mg).
Preincisional administration of epidural lidocaine and fentanyl was associated with a significantly lower rate of morphine use, lower cumulative morphine consumption, and reduced hyperalgesia compared with a sham epidural condition. These results highlight the importance of including a standard treatment control group to avoid the problems of interpretation that arise when two-group studies of preemptive analgesia (preincisional vs. postsurgery) fail to find the anticipated effects.
Two alcohol dehydrogenase genes (ADHIB and ADH1C on chromosome 4) and one aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2 on chromosome 12) exhibit functional polymorphisms that are associated with lower rates of alcohol dependence. The ALDH2*2 allele,found almost exclusively in Asian populations, has the strongest relationship. The ADH1B*2, ADH1B*3, and ADHlC*i alleles, found in varying prevalence in different ethnic groups, have also been associated with lower rates of alcohol dependence. Studies of the ADHIBand ADH1C haplotypes, however, have shown that ADH1C*I is in linkage disequilibrium with ADHiB*2, and the ADH1C*i allele does not appear to have significant unique associations with alcohol dependence. The hypothesized mechanism underlying the associations of the ADH1B and ALDH2 polymorphisms with alcohol dependence is that the isoenzymes encoded by these alleles lead to an accumulation of acetaldehyde during alcohol metabolism. Based on their kinetic properties, ALDH2 *2 theoretically should lead to a slower removal of acetaldehyde than ALDH2*1, whereas ADH1B*2 and ADH1B*3 should lead to a more rapid production of acetaldehyde than ADHIB*I. It is further hypothesized that elevations in acetaldehyde cause more intense reactions to alcohol and lead to lower levels of alcohol intake. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that elevations in acetaldehyde, increased sensitivity to alcohol, and lower levels of drinking reflect the mechanism by which the ALDH2*2 allele reduces risk for alcohol dependence. There is also some evidence supporting this mechanism for the ADH1B*2 and ADHIB*3 alleles, but the results are less consistent. These findings highlight the value of trying to elucidate the mechanism by which genes ultimately give rise to differences in alcohol dependence through the examination of mediating behaviors.
The incidence and localization of headache after spinal analgesia were studied by means of a questionnaire. The case material comprised 503 spinal analgesias carried out with a 4% hyperbaric and a 2% isobaric solution of mepivacaine respectively and with 0.5% isobaric solution of bupivacaine. The use of the 4% solution of mepivacaine was followed by an increased incidence of prolonged dull headache in the occipital region. The observations suggest that the occurrence of headache after spinal analgesia may also depend on the type of analgesic agent employed.
The Waardenburg syndromes (WS) account for approximately 2% of congenital sensorineural deafness. This heterogeneous group of diseases currently can be categorized into four major subtypes (WS types 1-4) on the basis of characteristic clinical features. Multiple genes have been implicated in WS, and mutations in some genes can cause more than one WS subtype. In addition to eye, hair, and skin pigmentary abnormalities, dystopia canthorum and broad nasal bridge are seen in WS type 1. Mutations in the PAX3 gene are responsible for the condition in the majority of these patients. In addition, mutations in PAX3 have been found in WS type 3 that is distinguished by musculoskeletal abnormalities, and in a family with a rare subtype of WS, craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome (CDHS), characterized by dysmorphic facial features, hand abnormalities, and absent or hypoplastic nasal and wrist bones. Here we describe a woman who shares some, but not all features of WS type 3 and CDHS, and who also has abnormal cranial bones. All sinuses were hypoplastic, and the cochlea were small. No sequence alteration in PAX3 was found. These observations broaden the clinical range of WS and suggest there may be genetic heterogeneity even within the CDHS subtype.
The anti-inflammatory influence of dapsone may involve suppression of neutrophil chemotaxis to selected attractants, but other actions of the drug are likely also involved. We have discovered that dapsone may suppress migration of neutrophils to extravascular sites through inhibition of adherence functions required for neutrophil recruitment. Neutrophil adherence mediated by integrins (CD11/CD18 or Mac-1 family receptors) was measured in vitro in terms of binding of stimulated cells to albumin-coated wells of microtiter plates, using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) as stimuli. Adherence was assessed by staining attached cells with crystal violet dye and measuring the dye concentration at OD590 using an automated plate reader. The role of integrins in this assay was confirmed by the ability of anti-integrin antibody to suppress stimulated neutrophil adherence. The OD590 value for cells adhering to albumin in the absence of stimulus and dapsone averaged 0.2 +/- 0.04 (SEM) over five experiments. In the presence of 0.1 microM PMA or 10(-6) M FMLP, the OD590 values averaged 0.88 +/- 0.1 and 0.75 +/- 0.12, respectively. Dapsone did not affect unstimulated neutrophil adherence but, when present with stimulus, produced a dose-related inhibitory effect on adherence. Fifty percent inhibitory doses were approximately 150 micrograms/ml dapsone for both stimuli. Sulfapyridine reproduced the inhibitory effect of dapsone, but two structurally related compounds, hydrochlorothiazide and furosamide, did not. The observed ability of dapsone to inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis under agarose to FMLP and interleukin-8 may also be explained by interference with integrin-mediated adherence required for motility in this assay system. To consider if dapsone might have a similar inhibitory influence on neutrophil adherence in vivo, we tested the stimulated adherence function of neutrophils isolated from three individuals on dapsone therapy for dermatitis herpetiformis. Stimulated adherence of patients' cells averaged less than 40 percent of the control value. Suppression of leukocyte integrin function may therefore also contribute to the ability of dapsone to inhibit neutrophil infiltration in neutrophilic dermatoses.
Anti-inflammatory strategies receive growing attention for their potential to prevent pathological deterioration in disorders such as Parkinson's disease, which is accompanied by inflammatory reactions that might play a critical role in the degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons. We investigated the influence of dexamethasone - a potent synthetic member of the glucocorticoids class of steroid hormones that acts as an anti-inflammatory - on the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of rats observed after intranigral injection of thrombin, a serine protease that induces inflammation through microglia proliferation and activation. We evaluated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons as well as astroglial and microglial populations; dexamethasone prevented the loss of astrocytes but was unable to stop microglial proliferation induced by thrombin. Moreover, dexamethasone produced alterations in the levels of nexin and the thrombin receptor PAR-1, and facilitated accumulation of alpha-synuclein induced by thrombin in dopaminergic neurons. Dexamethasone increased oxidative stress and expression of monoamine oxidase A and B, along with changes on different MAP kinases related to degenerative processes, resulting in a bigger loss of dopaminergic neurons after intranigral injection of thrombin in dexamethasone-treated animals. It is interesting to ascertain that inhibition of monoamine oxidase by tranylcypromine prevented neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons, thus suggesting that the deleterious effects of dexamethasone might be mediated by monoamine oxidase.
Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a common disorder characterized by focal abnormalities of bone remodeling. We previously identified variants at the CSF1, OPTN and TNFRSF11A loci as risk factors for PDB by genome-wide association study. Here we extended this study, identified three new loci and confirmed their association with PDB in 2,215 affected individuals (cases) and 4,370 controls from seven independent populations. The new associations were with rs5742915 within PML on 15q24 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, P = 1.6 × 10(-14)), rs10498635 within RIN3 on 14q32 (OR = 1.44, P = 2.55 × 10(-11)) and rs4294134 within NUP205 on 7q33 (OR = 1.45, P = 8.45 × 10(-10)). Our data also confirmed the association of TM7SF4 (rs2458413, OR = 1.40, P = 7.38 × 10(-17)) with PDB. These seven loci explained ∼13% of the familial risk of PDB. These studies provide new insights into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of PDB.
