The hypothesis that the accumulation of prostaglandin (PG)E2 during reperfusion of severely ischemic tissue contributes to a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was expanded to include a parallel role for levuglandins(LGs), gamma-ketoaldehydes produced by rearrangement of PGH2. LGE2 was shown to be more potent than PGE2 in causing breakdown of the BBB when injected intrahemispherically. Brain tissue necrosis was clearly evident with total doses of levuglandin as low as 100 nmole.
The aim of the study was to evaluate various visual parameters for early detection of ethambutol toxicity.
This was a prospective study of 104 eyes of 52 patients being treated with ethambutol in the Directly Observed Treatment Strategy Centre (Dr R P Centre for Opthalmic Sciences, New Delhi, India). Visual acuity, visual fields, visual evoked responses (VER), stereoacuity and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness on optical coherence tomography (OCT) were assessed. Examinations were done before the start of therapy, after 1 and 2 months of treatment, and 1 month after stopping ethambutol.
No visual functional defect was noted at baseline. On follow-up, visual acuity, colour vision, contrast sensitivity, fundus and stereoacuity were not affected in any patient. Visual field defects developed in 7.69% (8/104) of the eyes. Pattern-VER showed an increased mean latency of the P(100) wave after 1 and 2 months of therapy (p<0.001 for both) with 14.42% (15/104) of eyes showing more than 10 ms increase in latency. On OCT, significant loss of mean temporal RNFL thickness was detected in 2.88% (3/104) of eyes individually. Overall, 19.23% (20/104) of the studied eyes showed sub-clinical toxicity. Reversal of this observed toxicity on pattern-VER and visual fields was seen in 80% of eyes after 1 month of stoppage of ethambutol; however, mean VER latency remained delayed (p = 0.002).
Pattern-VER and visual field examinations are sensitive tests to detect early toxicity. Together with OCT, they may help to identify patients who are likely to develop clinical toxicity.
Pergolide is a widely used antiparkinsonian dopamine agonist. Following occasional case reports, two studies recently suggested potentially frequent and severe valvular disease associated with pergolide intake.
Although there is now strong evidence to consider that pergolide may induce valvulopathy, incidence, severity, and risk factors for this adverse effect remain to be clarified. Valvular disease associated with pergolide consists in fibrosis and resembles conditions described in carcinoid carcinoma and in patients taking fenfluramine therapy. The mechanisms leading to valvular fibrosis are unknown but involvement of 5-HT(2B) receptors, especially expressed in valvular fibroblasts, is suspected.
Following the recommendations of the Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits de Santé, we describe a clinical practice attitude for pergolide therapy in Parkinson's disease.
We studied the effects of daily ip administration of T4 (200 micrograms/100 g BW) or T3 (50 micrograms/100 g) to the rat (six per group) for 3 days with or without sodium ipodate (6 mg/100 g), propylthiouracil (PTU; 2 mg/100 g), propranolol (0.5 mg/100 g), or amiodarone (2.5 mg/100 g) on cardiac weight, 3',5'-diiodothyronine (3',5'-T2) to 3'-monoiodothyronine monodeiodinating activity (MA), mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha GPD), and/or cytosolic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). T4 treatment caused a 28% increase in cardiac weight, about an 11-fold increase in 3',5'-T2 MA, about a 27% increase in alpha GPD activity, and about a 129% increase in ODC activity. Administration of ipodate with T4 abolished all effects of T4 on the heart. PTU abolished the effect of T4 on alpha GPD and markedly reduced its effect on 3',5'-T2 MA and ODC activity; it had little effect on cardiac hypertrophy caused by T4 treatment. Propranolol reduced the increase in cardiac weight following T4 administration from 28% to 11%, but had a modest or no effect on T4-induced changes in other metabolic variables studied. Amiodarone also reduced the effect of T4 on heart weight, but had little or no influence on 3',5'-T2 MA, the only metabolic variable studied. T3 treatment of the rat caused a 35% increase in heart weight, about a 15-fold increase in 3',5'-T2 MA, about a 35% increase in alpha GPD, and about a 100% increase in ODC activity. Ipodate and PTU reduced the increase in 3',5'-T2 MA following T3 administration, but had no appreciable influence on heart weight, alpha GPD, and/or ODC activity. Propranolol and amiodarone had no significant effect on any of the changes studied after T3 administration. It was concluded that: 1) ipodate markedly lessens or abolishes the effects of T4 on the heart; 2) propranolol and amiodarone decrease cardiac hypertrophy in response to T4 administration, but have little or no effect on metabolic changes due to T4; 3) PTU curtails the metabolic effects of T4 on the heart but has little effect on cardiac hypertrophy; 4) none of the drugs studied affects cardiac changes occurring after T3 administration. The changes observed in 3',5'-T2 MA after ipodate and PTU treatment may have been a result of direct interaction of the drugs with the deiodinase.
To explore the role of the complement system and complement regulatory proteins in an immune-privileged organ, the eye.
Eyes of normal Lewis rats were analyzed for the expression of complement regulatory proteins, membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay-acceleration factor (DAF), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL, CD59), and cell surface regulator of complement (Crry), using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Zymosan, a known activator of the alternative pathway of complement system was injected into the anterior chamber of the eye of Lewis rats. Animals were also injected intracamerally with 5 microl (25 microg) of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against rat Crry (5I2) or CD59 (6D1) in an attempt to develop antibody induced anterior uveitis; control animals received 5 microl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), OX-18 (25 microg), G-16-510E3 (25 microg), or MOPC-21 (25 microg). The role of complement system in antibody-induced uveitis was explored by intraperitoneal injection of 35 U cobra venom factor (CVF), 24 hours before antibody injection. Immunohistochemical staining and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with Western blot analysis were used to detect the presence of membrane attack complex (MAC) and C3 activation products, respectively, in normal and antibody-injected rat eyes.
Complement activation product MAC was present in the normal rat eye, and intraocular injection of zymosan induced severe anterior uveitis. The complement regulatory proteins, MCP, DAF, CD59, and Crry, were identified in the normal rat eye. Soluble forms of Crry and CD59 were also detected in normal rat aqueous humor. Severe anterior uveitis developed in Lewis rats injected with a neutralizing mAb against Crry, with increased formation of C3 split products. Systemic complement depletion by CVF prevented the induction of anterior uveitis by anti-Crry mAb. Intracameral injection of anti-rat CD59 (6D1), anti-rat MHC class I antigen (OX-18), anti-rat Ig (G-16-510E3), or MOPC-21 caused no inflammatory reaction.
The results suggest that the complement system is continuously active at a low level in the normal eye and is tightly regulated by intraocular complement regulatory proteins.
The unique pharmacological profile of buprenorphine has led to its considerable success as an analgesic and as a treatment agent for drug abuse. Activation of nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptors has been postulated to account for certain aspects of buprenorphine's behavioral profile. In order to investigate the role of NOP activation further, a series of buprenorphine analogues has been synthesized with the aim of increasing affinity for the NOP receptor. Binding and functional assay data on these new compounds indicate that the area around C20 in the orvinols is key to NOP receptor activity, with several compounds displaying higher affinity than buprenorphine. One compound, 1b, was found to be a mu opioid receptor partial agonist of comparable efficacy to buprenorphine but with higher efficacy at NOP receptors.
Medications are a major source of acute kidney injury, especially in critically ill patients. Medication-induced renal injury can occur through a number of mechanisms. We present two cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) where inactive cytochrome P450 (CYP) polymorphism may have played a role. The first patient developed a biopsy-proven allergic interstitial nephritis following urethrotomy. Genetic testing revealed the patient to be heterozygous for an inactivating polymorphism CYP2C9*3 and homozygous for an inactivating polymorphism CYP2D6*4. Patient had received several doses of promethazine, which is metabolized by CYP2D6*4. Another patient developed AKI on several occasions after exposure to lansoprazole and allopurinol. CYP testing revealed the patient to be homozygous for inactivating polymorphism CYP2C19*2, which is responsible for the metabolism of lansoprazole. These are the first two cases of AKI associated with non-functional polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 superfamily. While the exact mechanism has not been worked out, it introduced the possibility of a new source of kidney injury.
Gemcitabine-associated thrombotic microangiopathy is being increasingly recognized as a serious complication of treatment. We report a normotensive patient who developed progressive hypertension after commencing gemcitabine therapy. She also developed subtle changes in her platelet count and serum creatinine months before her emergent presentation. Clinicians should be aware of new onset or worsening hypertension and 'mild' biochemical changes in gemcitabine-treated patients.
Acrylamide (AA) is a reactive monomer used in many technological applications, but it is the incidental formation during cooking of common starchy foods that leads to pervasive human exposure, typically in the range of 1 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day (d). AA is carcinogenic in multiple organs from both sexes of several rodent models and a consistent body of evidence points to a genotoxic mechanism based on metabolism to a DNA-reactive epoxide, glycidamide (GA). In F344 rats, tumorigenesis occurs in several hormonally regulated tissues (thyroid, mammary gland, and peri-testicular mesothelium), which has prompted speculation about endocrine dysregulation as a possible mechanism. The present study evaluated the effects of a 14 d exposure to AA administered through the drinking water on reproductive tissues and the hypothalamic-pituitary-testes (HPG) axis in male F344 rats. The doses selected encompass a range from approximately 2.5 mg/kg bw/d, which is carcinogenic after lifetime exposure, to 50 mg/kg bw/d, a maximally tolerable dose that causes hind limb paralysis. AA caused significant changes in serum hormones, histopathology, testicular gene expression, and cell proliferation, especially at the highest dose. Despite strong evidence for activation of the HPG axis subsequent to decreases in testosterone levels, and histopathological changes associated with significant effects on Leydig and germ cells, with concomitant mRNA expression changes, the precise mechanism(s) for AA-induced testicular toxicity remains unclear; however, the absence of evidence for increased proliferation of the peri-testicular mesothelium (Ki-67 immunoreactivity) does not support hormonal dysregulation as a contributing factor to the predisposition of this tissue to the carcinogenic effects of AA.
The PAX6 gene is a transcription factor expressed early in development, predominantly in the eye, brain and gut. It is well known that mutations in PAX6 may result in aniridia, Peter's anomaly and kertatisis. Here, we present mutation analysis of a patient with aniridia, autism and mental retardation. We identified and characterized a 1.3 Mb deletion that disrupts PAX6 transcriptional activity and deletes additional genes expressed in the brain. Our findings provide continued evidence for the role of PAX6 in neural phenotypes associated with aniridia.
In utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) leads to patterning defects in the female reproductive tract (FRT) and a propensity to the development of vaginal adenocarcinomas in humans. In the mouse, DES treatment similarly induces a plethora of FRT developmental defects, including stratification of uterine epithelium and presence of glandular tissue in cervix and vagina. Uterine abnormalities are associated with repression of the homeobox gene Msx2, and DES leads to an altered uterine response in Msx2 mutants including a dilated uterine lumen. Here we investigate the role of Msx2 in normal vaginal development and in FRT response to DES. During vaginal development, Msx2 is required for Tgfbeta2 and Tgfbeta3 expression and for proper vaginal epithelial differentiation. Moreover, Msx2 is involved in caudal Wolffian duct regression by promoting apoptosis. Consistently, neonatal DES exposure represses Msx2 expression in the Wolffian duct epithelium and inhibits its apoptosis and subsequent regression. Intriguingly, although DES treatment also represses Msx2 expression in the vaginal epithelium, a much more severe DES-induced vaginal phenotype was observed in Msx2 mutant mice, including a complete failure of Müllerian vaginal epithelial stratification and a severely dilated vaginal lumen, accompanied by loss of p63 and water channel protein expression. These results demonstrate a critical role for Msx2 in counteracting the effect of DES on FRT patterning and suggest that the response to DES may be highly variable depending on the genotype of an individual.
Valproate (VPA) has been used for decades in the treatment of epilepsy and migraine. However, maternal administration of VPA during pregnancy increases susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the offspring. The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation modification and its effects on the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the rat brain prenatally exposed to VPA. We exposed the rats in early pregnancy to VPA and found that the prenatal VPA exposure, in comparison with the prenatal vehicle exposure, induced demethylation in the promoter regions of wnt1 and wnt2, but not in those of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 and Dickkopf 1, in the prefrontal cortexes and hippocampi of the offspring. Consequently, both mRNA and protein expression of wnt1 and wnt2 were increased. Furthermore, the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway was upregulated, as indicated by the increased levels of β-catenin, hence the growing expression of its target genes. This work suggested an epigenetic action via which VPA, when administered in early pregnancy, induced dysregulation of signaling pathway, further facilitating susceptibility to ASDs.
Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may unmask seizures in mixed cocaine-benzodiazepine intoxication.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg/kg cocaine IP alone, 5 mg/kg diazepam alone, or a combination of diazepam and cocaine. Three minutes later, groups were challenged with vehicle or flumazenil 5 or 10 mg/kg IP. Animal behavior, seizures (time to and incidence), death (time to and incidence), and cortical EEG tracings were recorded.
Administration of flumazenil to animals after they had received a combination dose of cocaine and diazepam.
In group 1, animals received cocaine followed by vehicle. This resulted in 100% developing seizures and death. Group 2 received diazepam alone followed by vehicle. Animals became somnolent and none died. Group 3 received diazepam followed by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. Animals became somnolent after diazepam and then active after flumazenil administration. In group 4, a combination of cocaine and diazepam was administered simultaneously. This resulted in no overt or EEG-detectable seizures and a 50% incidence of death. Group 5 received a similar combination of cocaine and diazepam, followed later by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. This resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < .01), and death, 100% (P < or = .01), compared with group 4. Group 6 received cocaine and diazepam followed by 10 mg/kg flumazenil. This also resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < or = .01), and death, 90% (P < or = .05), compared with group 4.
Flumazenil can unmask seizures and increase the incidence of death in a model of combined cocaine-diazepam intoxications.
Although standard nephrotoxicity assessments primarily detect impaired renal function, KIM-1, clusterin, NGAL, osteopontin and TIMP-1 were recently identified biomarkers proposed to indicate earlier perturbations in renal integrity. The recent adulteration of infant and pet food with melamine (MEL) and structurally-related compounds revealed that co-ingestion of MEL and cyanuric acid (CYA) could form melamine-cyanurate crystals which obstruct renal tubules and induce acute renal failure. This study concurrently evaluated the ability of multiplexed urinary biomarker immunoassays and biomarker gene expression analysis to detect nephrotoxicity in F344 rats co-administered 60ppm each of MEL and CYA in feed or via gavage for 28days. The biomarkers were also evaluated for the ability to differentiate the effects of the compounds when co-administered using diverse dosing schedules (i.e., consecutive vs. staggered gavage) and dosing matrixes (i.e., feed vs. gavage). Our results illustrate the ability of both methods to detect and differentiate the severity of adverse effects in the staggered and consecutive gavage groups at much lower doses than previously observed in animals co-exposed to the compounds in feed. We also demonstrate that these urinary biomarkers outperform traditional diagnostic methods and represent a powerful, non-invasive indicator of chemical-induced nephrotoxicity prior to the onset of renal dysfunction.
Several trials have evaluated the role of amiodarone in decreasing mortality in patients at high risk of developing sudden death. Current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of amiodarone in myocardial infarction (MI) survivors with a depressed left ventricular function and/or frequent or complex ventricular ectopy. Some postinfarction trials (e.g., the Spanish Study of Sudden Death [SSSD]) found mortality rates in controls much lower than the expected figures. Other postinfarction trials--the European Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial (EMIAT) and the Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial (CAMIAT)--despite observing a 2-year mortality rate of about 15% as expected, could not demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality. Amiodarone decreases the risk of sudden death in postinfarction patients by about 35%. In patients with a history of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, evidence is not sufficiently strong to use amiodarone for prevention of sudden death. The 2 major trials on such patients, Group for the Study of Survival in Heart Failure in Argentina (Grupo de Estudio de la Sobrevida en la Insuficiencia Cardiaca en Argentina or GESICA) and the Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic Therapy in Congestive Heart Failure (STAT-CHF), arrived at conflicting results. Meta-analyses have been performed to overcome the small sample size of these trials, with the aim of assessing the benefit of amiodarone on total mortality. Differences among the recruited populations make it difficult to extract clinically applicable conclusions from these overviews. Even accepting that amiodarone might decrease total mortality by 10%, it is difficult to identify the patients for whom such a beneficial effect applies. A practical consequence of amiodarone trials is that this drug can be used rather safely in patients with left ventricular dysfunction of any etiology as, in contrast to some class I agents, it does not increase mortality. Therefore, amiodarone is the drug of choice when antiarrhythmic drug treatment is indicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
The appearance of peripheral neuropathy is the dose-limiting toxicity in many chemotherapy protocols, and glutamine has been proposed as a potentially neuroprotective agent in patients receiving paclitaxel.
In this non-randomised study, we assessed neurologic signs and symptoms, and changes in nerve-conduction studies in 46 consecutive patients given high-dose paclitaxel either with (n=17) or without (n=29) glutamine. Neurological assessments and electrodiagnostic studies were carried out at baseline and at least 2 weeks (median 32 days) after treatment.
Patients who received glutamine developed significantly less weakness (P = 0.02), less loss of vibratory sensation (P = 0.04) and less toe numbness (P = 0.004) than controls. The per cent change in the compound motor action potential (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes after paclitaxel treatment was lower in the glutamine group, but this finding was not statistically significant in these small groups.
In this study, serial neurologic assessment of patient symptoms and signs seemed to be a better indicator of a possible glutamine effect than sensory- or motor-nerve-conduction studies. Prospective randomised trials are needed to clarify the effect of glutamine on paclitaxel and other types of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.
Breast cancer incidence varies with diet and other environmental influences, including carcinogen exposure. However, the effects of carcinogens on cell growth control pathways are poorly understood. Here, we have examined processes that are activated in the mammary glands of rats treated with 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU). This synthetic carcinogen was used to study events occurring during mammary tumor initiation and development. In female Wistar-Furth rats, given 1 dose of MNU beginning at 50 days of age, 84% of the rats developed tumors by 46 weeks of age (latency 13-15 weeks). Changes in the gland occurred as early as 1-day post-MNU. Cells exhibited DNA damage, leading to chromosomal instability, supernumerary centrosomes and higher levels of Aurora A; these events correlated with the appearance of preneoplasia in the glands. In mammary tumors, elevated numbers of centrosomes coincided with genomic instability. Tumors were transplanted into syngeneic hosts and subsequent tumor generations displayed the same marker chromosomes in mostly aneuploid metaphases with hyperdiploid numbers of chromosomes, suggesting that clonality and aneuploidy were passed on from one generation to the next. Collectively, these data suggest that the carcinogen MNU induces changes resulting in genetic instability detectable before hyperplasia and tumors develop in the rat mammary gland.
We assessed the effect of long-term treatment with inhaled budesonide (BUD) on the occurrence of posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSC), bruises and hoarseness in children with asthma. Slit lamp examinations were performed in 157 asthmatic children treated with inhaled BUD at a mean daily dose of 504 microg (range 189-1,322 microg) for 3-6 yrs (mean 4.4 yrs). Measurements were compared with 111 age-matched children with asthma, who had never received treatment of exogenous corticosteroids (control group). The children were examined for bruises, their tendency to bruise and occurrence of voice changes. No incidents of PSC ascribable to BUD treatment were seen. One patient in the BUD group had been diagnosed with PSC before the study and this was still present. There were no statistically significant differences in number of bruises between the two groups (BUD=33, controls=3.2; p=0.70), area covered by bruises (BUD=10 cm2, controls=10.1 cm2; p=0.97), tendency to bruise (BUD=5/10, controls=5/10) or occurrence of hoarseness (BUD=20%, controls=21%; p=0.92). Furthermore, there was no correlation between the occurrence of bruises or tendency to bruise and duration of treatment, accumulated or current dose of BUD. A 3-6 yr treatment of children with inhaled budesonide at an average daily dose of about 500 microg is not associated with an increased occurrence of posterior subcapsular cataract, bruises, tendency to bruise, hoarseness or other noticeable voice changes.
Tumoral calcinosis is a rare form of soft tissue calcifications, initially described as an idiopathic condition, which could occur in uremic patients. Despite its distinct clinical and morphologic presentations, the underlying pathogenesis is unknown. We present a dialysis patient who developed tumoral calcinosis over the right shoulder after receiving a misplaced injection of human recombinant erythropoietin probably into the periarticular tissue. This case serves as an example highlighting the importance of periarticular inflammatory reaction in precipitating the development of the lesion in predisposed patients.
Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase type III inhibitor with positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects. A common side effect of milrinone is hypotension from the peripheral vasodilation. Although mild elevations in serum creatinine have been described previously in the setting of milrinone-induced hypotension, acute oligoanuric renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy has not yet been described. This case report is the first to document such a result and to report the successful use of peritoneal dialysis in this setting. Previous case reports documented vasopressin as an effective alternative to catecholamines in the treatment of milrinone-induced hypotension. This report documents the use of four vasopressor agents (including vasopressin) in this patient, with only vasopressin resulting in improvement in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Vasopressin may be the most effective vasopressor agent in the treatment of milrinone-induced hypotension.
A 65 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis developed marrow aplasia and jaundice owing to D-penicillamine treatment. Recovery of bone marrow was ineffective, and the patient finally died despite intensive therapeutic measures. The rare coexistence of myelotoxicity and hepatotoxicity is presented and discussed.
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US and UK. Recent studies implied that APAP-induced injury is partially mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which can activate and recruit neutrophils, exacerbating injury. Mature IL-1β is formed by caspase-1, dependent on inflammasome activation. The objective of this invetstigation was to evaluate the role of the Nalp3 inflammasome on release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), hepatic neutrophil accumulation and liver injury (ALT, necrosis) after APAP overdose. Mice deficient for each component of the Nalp3 inflammasome (caspase-1, ASC and Nalp3) were treated with 300mg/kg APAP for 24h; these mice had similar neutrophil recruitment and liver injury as APAP-treated C57Bl/6 wildtype animals. In addition, plasma levels of DAMPs (DNA fragments, keratin-18, hypo- and hyper-acetylated forms of high mobility group box-1 protein) were similarly elevated with no significant difference between wildtype and gene knockout mice. In addition, aspirin treatment, which has been postulated to attenuate cytokine formation and the activation of the Nalp3 inflammasome after APAP, had no effect on release of DAMPs, hepatic neutrophil accumulation or liver injury. Together, these data confirm the release of DAMPs and a sterile inflammatory response after APAP overdose. However, as previously reported minor endogenous formation of IL-1β and the activation of the Nalp3 inflammasome have little impact on APAP hepatotoxicity. It appears that the Nalp3 inflammasome is not a promising therapeutic target to treat APAP overdose.
Colitis involves immune cell-mediated tissue injuries, but the contribution of epithelial cells remains largely unclear. Vanin-1 is an epithelial ectoenzyme with a pantetheinase activity that provides cysteamine/cystamine to tissue. Using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-colitis model we show here that Vanin-1 deficiency protects from colitis. This protection is reversible by administration of cystamine or bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma antagonist. We further demonstrate that Vanin-1, by antagonizing PPARgamma, licenses the production of inflammatory mediators by intestinal epithelial cells. We propose that Vanin-1 is an epithelial sensor of stress that exerts a dominant control over innate immune responses in tissue. Thus, the Vanin-1/pantetheinase activity might be a new target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory bowel disease.
We sought to compare the efficacies of oral nifedipine and intravenous labetalol in the acute management of hypertensive emergencies of pregnancy.
We performed a randomized double-blind trial of oral nifedipine (10 mg) and intravenous labetalol (20 mg) in 50 peripartum patients with sustained systolic blood pressure of >/=170 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of >/=105 mm Hg. Both agents were repeated at sequentially escalating dosages every 20 minutes until a therapeutic goal of systolic blood pressure of <160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of <100 mm Hg was achieved. Crossover occurred if the treatment goal was not achieved after 5 doses. Primary outcome was time to achievement of the therapeutic goal. Secondary outcome variables were agent failure, urinary output, and adverse effects. Data were analyzed by unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and analysis of variance for repeated measures.
The time to achieve the blood pressure goal was significantly shorter with nifedipine (mean +/- SD, 25 +/- 13.6 minutes) than with labetalol (43.6 +/- 25.4 minutes; P =.002). No patients required crossover therapy. Urine output was significantly increased (P <.001) at 1 hour after nifedipine dosing (99 +/- 99 mL) compared with labetalol (44.8 +/- 19.1 mL) and remained significantly increased at 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after initial administration. Adverse effects were infrequent. There were no differences in maternal age, gestational age, number of antepartum patients, or enrollment blood pressures between groups.
Both oral nifedipine and intravenous labetalol are effective in the management of acute hypertensive emergencies of pregnancy; however, nifedipine controls hypertension more rapidly and is associated with a significant increase in urinary output.
FK506 is a macrolide immunosuppressant agent used in solid organ and bone marrow transplantation and for autoimmune disorders. FK506 is reported to have a number of neuropsychiatric side effects, including anxiety and tremor. Because FK506 was implicated in causing akathisia in a case report, we did a prospective, cross-sectional study of 25 renal transplant recipients to determine whether akathisia occurred and/or had a relationship to FK506 plasma levels. The Symptom Checklist-90-R, Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A), and Akathisia Rating (ARS) scales were administered. Higher FK506 plasma levels correlated with higher HAM-A scores. ARS scores did not correlate with FK506 plasma levels; however, when FK506 plasma levels were divided into "high" (> or = 0.9 ng/mL) and "low" (< 0.9 ng/mL) groups, total ARS and HAM-A scores were significantly higher in the "high" group. We discuss implications of these findings as well as management.
Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins that bind specifically to presynaptic membrane proteins called neurexins. Mutations in human neuroligin genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders in some families. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a single neuroligin gene (nlg-1), and approximately a sixth of C. elegans neurons, including some sensory neurons, interneurons and a subset of cholinergic motor neurons, express a neuroligin transcriptional reporter. Neuroligin-deficient mutants of C. elegans are viable, and they do not appear deficient in any major motor functions. However, neuroligin mutants are defective in a subset of sensory behaviors and sensory processing, and are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and mercury compounds; the behavioral deficits are strikingly similar to traits frequently associated with autism spectrum disorders. Our results suggest a possible link between genetic defects in synapse formation or function, and sensitivity to environmental factors in the development of autism spectrum disorders.
