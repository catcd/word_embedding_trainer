As a further development of our large program focused on the medicinal chemistry of translocator protein [TSPO (18 kDa)] ligands, a new class of compounds related to alpidem has been designed using SSR180575, emapunil, and previously published pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinoline derivatives 9 as templates. The designed compounds were synthesized by alkylation of the easily accessible 4-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-3(2H)-one derivatives 13-15 with the required bromoacetamides. Along with the expected 2-(4-methyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-1-yl)acetamide derivatives 10, 2-(4-methyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-9(3H)-yl)acetamide isomers 11 were isolated and characterized. The high TSPO affinity shown by new pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinoline derivatives 10 and especially 11 leads the way to further expand the chemical diversity in TSPO ligands and provides new templates and structure-affinity relationship data potentially useful in the design of new anxiolytic and neuroprotective agents.
Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by a progressive loss of memory capacities, due to sclerosis and functional impairment of mesiotemporal brain areas. We have shown recently that topiramate (TPM) dose-dependently protects hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons during initial status epilepticus in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy by inhibition of mitochondrial transition pore opening. In the present study, in order to evaluate possible positive effects of the treatment on learning and memory, we investigated water maze performance of rats receiving different dosages of TPM (20 and 100 mg/kg) after 40 min and 4 mg/kg diazepam after 160 min of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in relation to performance of animals receiving 4 mg/kg diazepam after 40 min of SE, and to performance of sham-treated control animals. Unexpectedly, 20 but not 100 mg/kg TPM significantly extenuated short-term memory deficits. While neuroprotective effects of TPM were observed in hippocampal CA subfields of animals treated with 100 mg/kg TPM, cell loss in rats treated with 20 mg/kg TPM was indistinguishable from animals receiving diazepam only. The present results indicate a negative dose-dependency of memory-saving effects of TPM applied during status epilepticus apparently dissociated from hippocampal neuroprotection.
The responses of a large suite of biochemical and genetic parameters were evaluated in tissues (liver, gills, muscle and erythrocytes) of the estuarine guppy Poecilia vivipara exposed to waterborne copper in salt water (salinity 24 ppt). Activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase), metallothionein-like protein concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated in liver, gills, and muscle. Comet assay score and nuclear abnormalities and micronucleated cell frequency were analyzed in peripheral erythrocytes. The responses of these parameters were evaluated in fish exposed (96 h) to environmentally relevant copper concentrations (5, 9 and 20 μg L⁻¹). In control and copper-exposed fish, no mortality was observed over the experimental period. Almost all biochemical and genetic parameters proved to be affected by waterborne copper exposure. However, the response of catalase activity in liver, ROS, ACAP and LPO in muscle, gills and liver, and DNA damages in erythrocytes clearly showed to be dependent on copper concentration in salt water. Therefore, the use of these parameters could be of relevance in the scope of biomonitoring programs in salt water environments contaminated with copper.
Imatinib is currently the treatment of choice in chronic myeloid leukemia. The use of this drug is safe, although some cases of imatinib-induced toxic hepatitis have been reported. We present 2 patients treated with this drug who developed acute anicteric hepatitis months after starting treatment. We also review 20 reports of individual cases to characterize imatinib-induced hepatitis. Imatinib-induced hepatitis has a variable latency period, frequently of several months. Half of the patients develop anicteric hepatitis and the clinical course is generally benign. A distinguishing feature of this entity is a transitory increase in transaminase levels in patients diagnosed with hepatitis in the weeks after treatment withdrawal. Resumption of imatinib use provokes hepatitis recurrence, which can be avoided by simultaneous prednisone administration.
A 15-year-old girl with homozygous sickle cell anemia (HbSS) and osteosarcoma is described. Delayed clearance of methotrexate (MTX) after the second course of high-dose MTX (HDMTX) led to the development of renal and hepatic toxicities. Rescue was accomplished with high-dose leucovorin, intravenous carboxypeptidase G2, and thymidine. Although the renal and hepatic abnormalities resolved, focal tonic-clonic seizures developed, accompanied by abnormal brain imaging. Four weeks after this episode, all clinical and biochemical abnormalities resolved. Preexistent end-organ damage associated with HbSS may compromise the ability to deliver high-dose chemotherapy with curative intent in patients with malignant disease.
Echocardiographic findings were studied in seventeen subjects with beta-Thalassemia major in order to see whether cardiac lesions caused by iron were related to the age and chelating therapy. The results demonstrate that the alterations of the heart can be early detected by echocardiography. In fact no patient with echocardiographic alterations showed clinical signs of cardiac dysfunction and only four patients showed E.C.G. alterations. Moreover the thickening of posterior wall and left ventricular diastolic diameter were related to iron overload, as demonstrated by urinary excretion after desferrioxamine. Since the patients regularly treated with desferrioxamine were few and younger aged it is not possible in this study to show the positive effect of desferrioxamine treatment in preventing cardiac lesions due to iron overload.
9-cis-Retinoic acid (9cRA) binds both retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and has been shown to be a potential chemopreventive agent both in lung cancer cell culture studies and in clinical trials studying former smokers. However, direct evidence of the efficacy of 9cRA against lung tumor development in vivo is lacking. In the present study, we determined whether treatment with 9cRA has the potential to inhibit lung carcinogenesis by upregulating RAR-beta and down-regulating COX-2 expression in the A/J mouse lung cancer model. A/J mice (n=14-15/group) were treated as follows: (1) Control (Sham treated); (2) NNK (100mg NNK/kg body weight); (3) NNK+9cRA (15mg/kg diet); and (4) NNK+celecoxib (a COX-2-specific inhibitor, 500mg/kg diet). Tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity, RAR-beta mRNA, COX-2 mRNA, and COX-2 protein levels in lung samples of mice were determined 4 months after carcinogen injection. The results showed that mice receiving 9cRA supplementation had significantly lower tumor multiplicity (48% reduction, P<0.05) and showed a trend toward lower tumor incidence (40% reduction, P=0.078), as compared with the mice given NNK alone. Although, celecoxib treatment resulted in greater declines in tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity (75 and 88%, respectively, P<0.05), the chemoprotective effects of celecoxib were accompanied by increased mortality while 9cRA treatment resulted in no weight-loss associated toxicity or mortality. Supplementation with 9cRA was effective in increasing RAR-beta mRNA, but this increase was not accompanied by decreased levels of COX-2 mRNA or protein. These results suggest that 9cRA supplementation may provide protection against lung carcinogenesis and this effect may be mediated in part by 9cRA induction of RAR-beta, but not inhibition of COX-2 transcription.
Coumarin necrosis is a rare but clinical very important complication of therapy with coumarin derivatives. We report a patient with congenital protein S deficiency type II, who developed coumarin necrosis during stabilization of phenprocoumon. Diagnostic problems and therapeutic alternatives are discussed considering the recent literature.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a highly prevalent constituent of plastics that has been associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and an increased risk of miscarriages in humans. In mice, BPA exposure disrupts the process of meiosis; however, analysis of the affected molecular pathways is lagging and has been particularly challenging. Here we show that exposure of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to BPA, at internal concentrations consistent with mammalian models, causes increased sterility and embryonic lethality. BPA exposure results in impaired chromosome synapsis and disruption of meiotic double-strand break repair (DSBR) progression. BPA carries an anti-estrogenic activity in the germline and results in germline-specific down-regulation of DSBR genes, thereby impairing maintenance of genomic integrity during meiosis. C. elegans therefore constitutes a model of remarkable relevance to mammals with which to assess how our chemical landscape affects germ cells and meiosis.
The present study was designed to investigate the proconvulsant effect of morphine (10, 30, 50 mg/kg, sc) in mice on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-, picrotoxin-, and bicuculline (BCC)-induced convulsions which are thought to be produced by interactions with GABAergic systems. Morphine increased the severity of seizures induced by the ip (50 mg/kg) and sc (90 mg/kg) routes of administration of PTZ. An administration of morphine caused an increased incidence of multiple seizures following both ip and sc administration of PTZ and prolonged the latency to onset of seizures induced by ip injection of PTZ. Repeated morphine administration (30, 50 mg/kg, ip x 4d) also caused an increased incidence of multiple seizures and the latency to onset of seizures by ip injection of PTZ. All these effects of morphine are naloxone-sensitive. Single morphine administration potentiated seizures induced by picrotoxin (2 mg/kg, iv) and BCC (20 mg/kg, iv). These results demonstrate that morphine has a proconvulsant effect on PTZ-induced seizures in the mouse.
We tested the hypothesis that the pharmacologic properties of a small volume of alpha alpha-cross-linked hemoglobin (alpha alpha Hb) could effectively resuscitate pigs subjected to hemorrhage.
Fourteen pigs hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mm Hg for 60 minutes were treated with a 4-mL/kg 2-minute infusion of 10 g/dL alpha alpha Hb or 7 g/dL human serum albumin, an oncotically matched control solution.
The removal of blood (17 +/- 1.5 mL/kg) caused the typical physiologic responses to hemorrhagic hypovolemia. Infusion of alpha alpha Hb restored mean arterial pressure and coronary perfusion pressure, but cardiac output and mixed venous O2 saturation did not improve significantly. Pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly and were higher than baseline levels after alpha alpha Hb. Infusion of human serum albumin produced only minor hemodynamic changes. Brain blood flow did improve to baseline values after alpha alpha Hb, but was the only tissue to do so. In the human serum albumin group, superior mesenteric artery blood flow recovered to baseline values, whereas brain blood flow did not. Blood flows to other tissues were similar in both groups.
Small-volume infusion of alpha alpha Hb restored mean arterial pressure and brain blood flow, but pulmonary hypertension and low peripheral perfusion may offset benefits for trauma patients.
Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection is the most common cause of gastric cancer. H. pylori induces oxidative stress while zinc deficiency results in increased sensitivity to it. In Ecuador, the prevalence of gastric cancer and zinc deficiency are high. We hypothesized that zinc deficiency in Ecuadorian people would cause increased H. pylori-induced inflammation in the gastric mucosa associated with lower tissue zinc concentrations.
Three hundred and fifty-two patients with dyspepsia underwent endoscopy to obtain gastric mucosa biopsies. Diagnosis of H. pylori infection and its severity, histopathology, mucosal zinc concentration, and inflammation intensity were determined.
H. pylori-infected patients with non-atrophic chronic gastritis had lower concentrations of zinc in gastric mucosa than uninfected patients with the same type of gastritis (251.3 +/- 225.3 vs. 426.2 +/- 279.9 ng/mg of protein; p = .016). Considering all patients, the more severe the H. pylori infection, the higher the percentage of subjects with infiltration by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells (p = .0001). Patients with high PMN infiltration had lower mucosal zinc concentrations than patients with low PMN infiltration (35.2 +/- 20.7 vs. 242.9 +/- 191.8 ng/mg of protein; p = .021).
The degree of inflammation in H. pylori-induced gastritis appears to be modulated by gastric tissue zinc concentrations.
The adverse effects of combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, including neurotoxicity, arthralgia and muscle pain, were evaluated in 21 patients (30 courses) using questionnaires of the Gynecologic Oncology Chemotherapy Joint Research Group. The scores of pain and numbness peaked from the third to fourth day of treatment. Although the pain score improved subsequently, the numbness score persisted at a high level. Compared to the first and second courses, the peak pain score was higher and persisted for a longer duration in the fifth and sixth courses. Using the questionnaires, we were able to recognize a high incidence of numbness and pain in patients on combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, and identify the degree and temporal changes of the adverse effects. Our results suggest that the questionnaires used in this study are clinically useful for evaluating the degree and clinical course of pain and numbness in anticancer chemotherapy.
Staphylococcal enterotoxin type A induced marked neutrophil migration into the mouse peritoneal cavity and was dependent on the number of resident macrophages. This migratory response was dose- (16-64 microg of staphylococcal enterotoxin type A/cavity) and time-dependent, peaking at 12 h and disappearing after 72 h. Dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) inhibited the neutrophil migration induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin type A (32 microg; 42% inhibition). A similar response was observed with the platelet-activating factor-acether receptor antagonist, BN 52021 (ginkgolide B, 3-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-hexahydro-1,4-7b-trihydroxy-8-methyl-9H-1,7alph a (epoxymethano-1H,6alphaH-cyclopenta (c) furo (2,3-b) furo (3', 2': 3,4) cyclopenta (1,2-d) furan-5, 9, 12 (4H)-trione); 10 mg/kg; 57% inhibition), the histamine H2 receptor antagonist, cimetidine (2 mg/kg; 31% inhibition), the lipoxygenase inhibitor, BWA4C (N-(3-phenoxycinnamyl) acetohydroxamic acid); 10 mg/kg; 73% inhibition), and capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonamide), a sensory C-fiber neuropeptide depletor. In contrast, indomethacin (5 mg/kg) had no effect on staphylococcal enterotoxin type A-induced chemotaxis. We conclude that the peritonitis induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin type A in mice is macrophage-dependent. The mechanism whereby staphylococcal enterotoxin type A stimulates macrophages to induce neutrophil recruitment remains to be elucidated.
To determine whether deleted in colon cancer (DCC) protein expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) metastases could predict outcome to palliative fluorouracil (FU)-based chemotherapy and to assess whether it is similar to that observed in the corresponding primary tumors.
DCC protein expression was assessed immunohistochemically on archival specimens of CRC metastases from 42 patients homogeneously treated by methotrexate-modulated bolus FU alternated to 6-S-leucovorin-modulated infused FU and was retrospectively correlated with patient characteristics and clinical outcome. In a subset analysis, DCC immunoreactivity was compared between metastatic CRC and the corresponding primary tumors and regional lymph node metastases.
Positive immunoreactivity for DCC was found in 45% of patients. Eighteen (78%) of 23 patients for whom multiple samples were available displayed a similar pattern of expression in distant metastases and primary tumors. The median survival time was 14.3 months in patients without DCC expression and 21.4 months in patients with DCC-positive tumors (log-rank test, P =.04); the 2-year survival rates were 8.5% and 42.5%, respectively. Response rates to chemotherapy were not significantly different between the two groups. By multivariate analysis, DCC protein expression maintained its prognostic value and showed to be the single best predictor of survival, with a relative risk of 2.16.
Our results indicate that expression of the DCC protein in CRC metastases is similar to that observed in the corresponding primary tumors and represents a dominant predictor of survival in patients with unresectable, advanced CRC who are undergoing palliative FU-based chemotherapy.
Patients with combined hyperlipidemia and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels may benefit from combination therapy with a statin and niacin; therefore, we assessed the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin and extended-release (ER) niacin alone and in combination in 270 patients with this atherogenic dyslipidemia. Men and women > or =18 years with fasting total cholesterol levels > or =200 mg/dl, triglycerides 200 to 800 mg/dl, apolipoprotein B > or cf=110 mg/dl, and HDL cholesterol <45 mg/dl were randomized to 1 of 4 treatments in this 24-week, open-label, multicenter trial: rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg; ER niacin 0.5 to 2 g; rosuvastatin 40 mg/ER niacin 0.5 to 1 g; or rosuvastatin 10 mg/ER niacin 0.5 to 2 g. Percent changes from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and other lipid measurements at week 24 were determined by analysis of variance, with statistical testing performed separately between the rosuvastatin monotherapy group and each remaining treatment group. Daily doses of rosuvastatin 40 mg reduced LDL and non-HDL cholesterol significantly more than either ER niacin 2 g or rosuvastatin 10 mg/ER niacin 2 g (-48% vs -0.1% and -36% for LDL cholesterol and -49% vs -11% and -38% for non-HDL cholesterol, respectively; p <0.01 for all comparisons); no additional reduction in LDL or non-HDL cholesterol was observed with the combination of rosuvastatin 40 mg/ER niacin 1.0 g (-42% and -47%; p = NS). Triglyceride reductions ranged from -21% (ER niacin monotherapy) to -39% (rosuvastatin 40 mg/ER niacin 1 g), but no observed differences were statistically significant. Compared with rosuvastatin alone, rosuvastatin 10 mg/ER niacin 2 g produced significantly greater increases in HDL cholesterol (11% vs 24%, p <0.001) and apolipoprotein A-I (5% vs 11%, p <0.017). Similar increases in HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were noted between the monotherapy groups. Over 24 weeks, rosuvastatin alone was better tolerated than either ER niacin alone or the combinations of rosuvastatin and ER niacin.
The use of valproic acid (VPA) (also known as Depakote, Depakene, and others) frequently results in elevated plasma ammonia. In some people, hyperammonemia may be clinically significant, resulting in hyperammonemic encephalopathy, which may be severe. Valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy may occur in people with normal liver function, despite normal doses and serum levels of VPA. We describe 2 cases of valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients with supratherapeutic VPA levels, although the condition has been described in people with normal VPA levels. With the increasing indications and off-label uses of VPA, family physicians should be aware of this potential complication of VPA and check ammonia levels in patients taking VPA who present with alterations in mental status. Treatment with L-carnitine may be beneficial in reducing ammonia levels.
Recently, the neurotoxicity of dopamine (DA) quinone formation by auto-oxidation of DA has focused on dopaminergic neuron-specific oxidative stress. In the present study, we examined DA quinone formation in methamphetamine (METH)-induced dopaminergic neuronal cell death using METH-treated dopaminergic cultured CATH.a cells and METH-injected mouse brain. In CATH.a cells, METH treatment dose-dependently increased the levels of quinoprotein (protein-bound quinone) and the expression of quinone reductase in parallel with neurotoxicity. A similar increase in quinoprotein levels was seen in the striatum of METH (4 mg/kg X4, i.p., 2 h interval)-injected BALB/c mice, coinciding with reduction of DA transporters. Furthermore, pretreatment of CATH.a cells with quinone reductase inducer, butylated hydroxyanisole, significantly and dose-dependently blocked METH-induced elevation of quinoprotein, and ameliorated METH-induced cell death. We also showed the protective effect of tyrosinase, which rapidly oxidizes DA and DA quinone to form stable melanin, against METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo using tyrosinase null mice. Our results indicate that DA quinone formation plays an important role, as a dopaminergic neuron-specific neurotoxic factor, in METH-induced neurotoxicity, which is regulated by quinone formation-related molecules.
The effects of beta-phenethylamine (PEA), d-amphetamine and LSD were studied on spinal reflexes, autonomic signs, and behavior in the non-tolerant and LSD tolerant (30 microgram/kg/day) chronic spinal dog. LSD (10 microgram/kg) facilitated the flexor reflex, produced the stepping reflex, increased respiration, pulse rate and temperature, slightly dilated pupils and produced whining, tracking and restlessness. Direct tolerance developed to all of these effects except temperature. PEA (0.8 mg/kg/min infused for 12 min) and amphetamine (3.2 mg/kg) facilitated the flexor reflex, increased respiration, temperature and the skin twitch reflex latency, caused a marked mydriasis, retracted the nictitating membrane and produced restlessness and stereotypic head movements. PEA but not amphetamine elicited stepping, and only amphetamine consistently slowed heart rate. No cross tolerance to the physiologic or behavioral effects of amphetamine was observed. Partial tolerance developed only to the actions of PEA on the stepping reflex and the nictitating membrane. The single dose effects and the lack of cross tolerance to amphetamine and PEA suggest modes of action different from LSD. PEA has some actions which differ from those of amphetamine.
To report a case of simultaneous erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after local lidocaine injection.
A 33-year-old female experienced coexisting erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after lidocaine spray was used for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The reaction was exacerbated after localized injection of 2% lidocaine for a skin biopsy. An objective causality assessment revealed that an adverse drug reaction was highly probable.
Lidocaine is the most frequently used local anesthetic agent. The coexistence of erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme has been reported in lepromatous leprosy, Yersinia enterocolítica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis gastrointestinal infection (both with diarrhea), histoplasmosis, hepatitis C, and milkeŕs nodule, but not with lidocaine.
If clinicians observe similar lesions after lidocaine exposure, they should suspect an adverse drug reaction and exercise caution in the administration of amide anesthetics to patients with a documented history of adverse reaction to lidocaine.
An unusual hepatic disease developed in 3 patients with a well-functioning kidney graft 16-24 months after transplantation. Vague abdominal pain, increased bleeding tendency and edema were initial complaints, and hepato- or splenomegaly and ascites were found as well. Liver function tests were not or only mildly disturbed; hemolysis and pancytopenia were always present. Colloid uptake was absent at liver scintigraphy and the hepatic venous wedge pressure was increased. Esophageal varices were demonstrated. Liver biopsy showed extensive midzonal and pericentral sinusoidal dilatation. After discontinuation of azathioprine the symptoms and the extent of sinusoidal dilatation disappeared gradually, but after 1-3 years fibrosis or micronodular cirrhosis had developed and splenomegaly with hypersplenism remained. These observations strongly suggest an association between chronic use of azathioprine and the development of venous congestion of the liver with sinusoidal dilatation, eventually resulting in chronic liver disease.
The neurotoxicity of albumin was studied in the rat. Solutions of rat albumin (3, 10 and 30 mg/ml) essentially free of fatty acids and globulins were injected into one neostriatum, physiological saline into the other. Injections were also performed with sodium glutamate (10 and 30 mM). Both albumin and glutamate produced lesions in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus 3, 10 and 30 mg/ml albumin produced lesions in excess of saline of 22 +/- 24 microns3, 67 +/- 25 microns3 and 170 +/- 44 microns3, (P = 0.82, 0.03 and 0.0005, respectively). 10 and 30 mM sodium glutamate caused lesions of 45 +/- 14 microns3 and 315 +/- 56 microns3 in excess of saline (P = 0.04 and 0.0004, respectively). Injection of 10 mg/ml albumin together with 10 mM sodium glutamate caused lesions of 70 +/- 11 microns3 in excess of saline (P = 0.005). This was not significantly different from the lesions caused by any of the two substances alone. Thus no potentiating effect of one substance on the toxicity of the other was seen in this study. The neurotoxicity of albumin could be of importance in disease states which are accompanied by leakiness of the blood-brain barrier.
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen 600% over the last 30 years. With a 5-year survival rate of ~15%, the identification of new therapeutic targets for EAC is greatly important. We analyze the mutation spectra from whole-exome sequencing of 149 EAC tumor-normal pairs, 15 of which have also been subjected to whole-genome sequencing. We identify a mutational signature defined by a high prevalence of A>C transversions at AA dinucleotides. Statistical analysis of exome data identified 26 significantly mutated genes. Of these genes, five (TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, ARID1A and PIK3CA) have previously been implicated in EAC. The new significantly mutated genes include chromatin-modifying factors and candidate contributors SPG20, TLR4, ELMO1 and DOCK2. Functional analyses of EAC-derived mutations in ELMO1 identifies increased cellular invasion. Therefore, we suggest the potential activation of the RAC1 pathway as a contributor to EAC tumorigenesis.
Foscarnet is an antiviral agent used to treat cytomegalovirus infection in AIDS patients and in transplant recipients. In most cases, foscarnet induces reversible tubulo-interstitial lesions which can be avoided by correct hydration. We report the first case of crystal foscarnet precipitation within glomerular capillaries in a renal transplant.
The recipient, a 49-year-old man, developed a nephrotic syndrome with haematuria and an acute renal failure after foscarnet therapy for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The polarization examination of the first graft biopsy revealed the presence of birefringent crystals within glomeruli and tubules. Infrared analysis attested to the presence of trisodium foscarnet salts and mixed sodium calcium salts coloured by Von Kossa's reaction. A second biopsy showed glomerular sclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and crystal vanishing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in situ applied to this biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection.
These adverse effects might be the result of a toxic synergy between foscarnet and other drugs. In cases with crystalline precipitation, graft biopsy remains the best mean of diagnosis and follow-up of glomerular damage.
Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is induced by low-molecular weight electrophilic chemicals and metal ions. Chemical contact sensitizers trigger reactive oxygen species production and provoke electrophilic stress, leading to the accumulation of the transcription factor nuclear-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in innate immune cell types. The objective of this work was to identify the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of ACD. We used the local lymph node assay (LLNA) and the mouse ear swelling test (MEST) to study the role of Nrf2 in both the sensitization and elicitation phase in nrf2 knockout (nrf2(-/-)) and wild-type (nrf2(+/+)) mice. Five chemicals were used: two compounds known to react with cysteine residues, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and cinnamaldehyde (CinA); one sensitizer known to exhibit mixed reactivity to cysteine and lysine residues, isophorone diisocyanate; and one reacting specifically with lysine residues, trimellitic anhydride and croton oil, a well-known irritant. In the MEST assay, DNCB (1 and 2%) induced a significant increase in ear thickness in nrf2(-/-) compared with nrf2(+/+) mice, suggesting a role for Nrf2 in the control of the inflammatory process. When DNCB was used at 0.25 and 0.5% or when mice were treated with CinA, inflammation was found only in nrf2(-/-) mice. In the LLNA, all chemical sensitizers induced an increase of lymphocyte proliferation in nrf2(-/-) compared with nrf2(+/+) mice for the same chemical concentration. These results reveal an important role for Nrf2 in controlling ACD and lymphocyte proliferation in response to sensitizers.
About 5-10% of patients with myasthenia gravis concomitantly have other autoimmune diseases. However, the coexistence of myasthenia gravis and pernicious anemia is rare. Here, we report a 73-year-old Taiwanese woman who developed myasthenia gravis 5 months after the onset of pernicious anemia. Her myasthenic and pernicious anemia symptoms markedly improved after pyridostigmine, prednisolone and hydroxocobalamine treatment. It is important to recognize concurrence of myasthenia gravis and pernicious anemia in the same patient because the therapeutic results for both diseases are rewarding.
