The relationship between severity of dopa-induced parkinsonian symptoms and the latency and severity of dopa-induced dyskinesias was studied in monkeys exposed to the toxin MPTP. Levodopa and D-2 receptor agonist-induced dyskinesias appeared early, between 2 and 12 days after initiation of dopa therapy in severely parkinsonian animals. In these animals, it was difficult to find a dose of L-dopa which had beneficial effects clinically and no dyskinesia-producing effects. These animals were all found to have massive (greater than or equal to 95%) striatal dopamine loss. A monkey with mild parkinsonian symptoms never developed dyskinesias similar to those produced in the severely affected animals. Stereotypies could be induced in this animal with excessively high doses of L-dopa or the dopamine D-2 receptor agonist, LY-171555. These movements were controlled by reducing the drug dose. This animal had less severe striatal dopamine loss (less than 80%) than the former group of monkeys. These results suggest that dopa dyskinesias in parkinsonian monkeys may be related to the extent of damage sustained by the nigrostriatal system.
We investigated the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA level, and TH activity and catecholamine levels in the adrenal medulla of the rat. DEX (1 mg/kg/day, s.c.) was administered for 2 days, and a control group was given corn oil. DEX significantly increased systolic blood pressure. TH mRNA level, TH activity, epinephrine level, and norepinephrine level in the adrenal medulla of DEX-treated rats were significantly higher than those of control rats. Also, epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in plasma were significantly higher in DEX-treated rats than in controls. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine prevented the DEX-induced blood pressure increase. These results suggest that the catecholamine synthetic pathway may be involved in DEX-induced hypertension.
To investigate the ability of systemically delivered BCNU to enhance the activity of either systemically delivered irinotecan (CPT-11) or locally delivered camptothecin from a biodegradable polymer for treatment of an intracranial 9L gliosarcoma.
We used a single systemic dose of BCNU on treatment day 1 in combination with systemic doses of CPT-11 on treatment days 1-5 and 8-12 against an intracranial rat 9L gliosarcoma model implanted into female Fischer 344 rats. We also used the same systemic dose of BCNU given on treatment day 1, followed by a local dose of a 20% loaded camptothecin biodegradable polymer implanted on the same day.
Two doses of CPT-11 (10 and 60 mg/kg) were delivered systemically against intracranial 9L. Neither dose showed an increase in survival compared to controls ( P>0.2 for 10 mg/kg and P=0.17 for 60 mg/kg). Systemic delivery of CPT-11 (10 mg/kg per day) in combination with systemic BCNU (15 mg/kg) did not show a significant effect on survival compared to systemic BCNU alone ( P>0.2), even at the maximally tolerated systemic dose of CPT-11 (60 mg/kg per day; P=0.06). The combination of systemic BCNU (15 mg/kg) and intracranial delivery of camptothecin (20% loaded polymer), however, significantly extended survival compared to systemic BCNU alone ( P<0.001) and compared to intracranial delivery of camptothecin alone ( P=0.01).
In a 9L gliosarcoma model, systemic delivery of CPT-11 showed no benefit in survival when delivered alone or in combination with systemic BCNU, because CPT-11 is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier in cytotoxic levels. When cytotoxic levels of a topoisomerase I inhibitor are delivered directly to the brain tumor via a biodegradable polymer, however, the systemic delivery of the alkylating agent BCNU significantly enhances the antitumor effects of camptothecin in a 9L gliosarcoma model.
The effects of hemodynamic stress produced by i.v. infusion of nitroprusside on discharge characteristics of noradrenergic locus ceruleus (LC) neurons were compared to those produced by central administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Like CRF, both nitroprusside infusion and blood volume withdrawal increased LC spontaneous discharge. Additionally, nitroprusside disrupted the response of LC cells to repeated sciatic nerve stimulation in a manner similar to CRF. The neuronal effects of nitroprusside were prevented by prior administration of a CRF antagonist, alpha helical CRF9-41, but not by dexamethasone, which blocks CRF release into the hypophysial portal circulation. These results suggest that LC activation by hemodynamic stress is mediated by neuronal CRF release onto LC neurons. alpha Helical CRF9-41 had no effect on the magnitude or timecourse of nitroprusside-elicited hypotension, suggesting that LC activation by nitroprusside is not important for maintaining hemodynamic homeostasis. Finally, chronic administration of desmethylimipramine (DMI) attenuated the response of LC cells to nitroprusside, but not to CRF, suggesting that antidepressant therapy may inhibit stress-induced CRF release. This study supports the concept that CRF serves as a neurotransmitter in the LC in the initiation of stress responses.
Mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection usually observed in diabetic or neutropenic patients. Prognosis is serious with a high rate of mortality. Intravenous amphotericin B is the gold standard treatment. The main side effect is renal failure. Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome(R)) is not nephrotoxic and can be proposed as an alternative treatment although its cost is high. We report a case of mucormycosis in a diabetic woman who developed renal failure after intravenous amphotericin B treatment. AmBisome(R) could not be used for long-term treatment due to its high case. The patient was given nebulized amphotericin B and achieved recovery. This kind of treatment may provide a useful alternative to intravenous amphotericin B.
Alcohol abuse is one of the major causes of liver fibrosis, which shows a sharply increasing trend worldwide, yet effective therapeutic options for advanced alcohol fibrosis are limited. Recently we investigated the effect of anti-fibrosis by isoorientin-2″-O-α-L-arabinopyranosyl (IOA) isolated from Gypsophila elegans. During the experiment, the model group received alcohol only, and treatment groups received the corresponding drugs plus alcohol respectively, while the normal control group received an equal volume of saline. Analysis at the end of 24-week experiments showed that IOA could significantly improve the liver function, as indicated by decreasing levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, IOA could effectively inhibit collagen deposition and reduce the pathological tissue damage. Research on mechanism showed that IOA was able to markedly reduce lipid peroxidation, recruit the anti-oxidative defense system, and induce HSC apoptosis by down-regulating bcl-2 mRNA, as well as inhibit the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor β1 proteins. In short, our results showed that IOA is effective in attenuating hepatic injury and fibrosis in the alcohol-induced rat model, which should be developed as a new drug to treat liver fibrosis and even cirrhosis.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be responsible for breast cancer formation and recurrence; therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting CSCs must be developed. One approach may be targeting signaling pathways, like Notch, that are involved in stem cell self-renewal and survival.
Breast cancer stem-like cells derived from cell lines and patient samples were examined for Notch expression and activation. The effect of Notch inhibition on sphere formation, proliferation, and colony formation was determined.
Breast cancer stem-like cells consistently expressed elevated Notch activation compared with bulk tumor cells. Blockade of Notch signaling using pharmacologic and genomic approaches prevented sphere formation, proliferation, and/or colony formation in soft agar. Interestingly, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, MRK003, induced apoptosis in these cells.
Our findings support a crucial role for Notch signaling in maintenance of breast cancer stem-like cells, and suggest Notch inhibition may have clinical benefits in targeting CSCs.
Patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) often present with nasal congestion, poor sleep, daytime fatigue, and daytime somnolence. Pharmacologic therapy that reduces nasal congestion should improve the PAR patients' sleep quality and reduce daytime somnolence and fatigue. Our hypothesis is that intranasal steroid budesonide (BUD), an effective topical anti-inflammatory agent, will reduce nasal congestion and improve the patients' quality of life. The objective of this study was to determine whether topical steroid BUD improves sleep, daytime somnolence, and fatigue in patients with PAR. Twenty-six subjects were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study using Balaam's design. Patients were treated with intranasal steroid spray BUD or placebo. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale, daily diary, and questionnaires were used as tools for subjective data analysis, which focused on nasal symptoms, sleep quality, daytime somnolence, and fatigue. The results were summarized and compared by PROC MIXED in SAS. The daily diary data showed significant improvement in self-reported nasal congestion (p = 0.04) and daytime sleepiness (p = 0.01) and a trend in reduction of daytime fatigue (p = 0.08) in the BUD group compared with the placebo group. The sleep measures showed statistically significant improvement in total sleep measures score (p = 0.04), "sleep compared with absolute" (p = 0.01), and "refreshing and restorative" sleep (p = 0.04) in the active group. Nasal corticosteroid BUD is effective in reducing nasal congestion, daytime somnolence, and daytime fatigue, and improving sleep quality in PAR.
We report a patient with psoriasis and hepatitis C virus infection who initially presented with psoriatic erythroderma and eventually showed complete clearance of psoriatic lesions following acute hepatitis induced by etretinate treatment. Cytokine synthesis capabilities in peripheral blood T cells obtained at different stages were evaluated in this patient. A dramatic increase in the frequency of interferon-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood was observed during the erythrodermic stage. In contrast, the frequencies of interleukin (IL)-4- and IL-13-producing CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were remarkably high at the resolution stage. These results clearly indicate that a shift towards type 2 cytokine predominance contributes to the resolution of severe psoriasis.
Nitric oxide (NO), synthesized from L-arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), seems to play an ambiguous role during tissue ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study was designed to investigate the effects of resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin, in renal ischemia reperfusion (RIR) injury in rats.
Forty-eight rats were randomized into six groups. Group 1: sham operated (C); group 2: right nephrectomy (UNI); group 3: UNI + 45 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion in the contralateral kidney; group 4: UNI + RIR + L-NAME (10 mg/kg, i.p.); group 5: UNI + RIR + resveratrol (5 mg/kg, p.o.); group 6: UNI + RIR + resveratrol + L-NAME. At the end of the reperfusion period, rats were sacrificed. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined in renal tissue. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured for the evaluation of renal function. Tissue and urine nitrite levels were measured to assess total nitric oxide levels.
Ischemic control animals demonstrated severe deterioration of renal function, altered renal morphology, reduced total nitric oxide levels and a marked renal oxidative stress.
Pretreatment of animals with resveratrol markedly attenuated renal dysfunction, morphological alterations, improved nitric oxide levels, reduced elevated TBARS levels and restored the depleted renal antioxidant enzymes, However, treatment with L-NAME attenuated this protection afforded by resveratrol indicating that resveratrol exerts its protective effect through NO release.
1-Methylpyrene, a carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, forms benzylic DNA adducts, in particular N2-(1-methylpyrenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine, in mice and rats. It is bioactivated via 1-hydroxymethylpyrene (1-HMP) to electrophilic 1-sulfooxymethylpyrene (1-SMP). In this study, we explored the role of individual mouse sulfotransferase (SULT) forms in this activation. First, we showed that all nine mouse SULTs tested were able to activate 1-HMP to a mutagen in the his- Salmonella typhimurium reversion test. Some activation was even observed with Sult2a3 and Sult5a1, orphan forms for which no substrates were identified hitherto. Subsequently, we used cytosolic preparations from tissues of four mouse lines (wild-type, Sult1a1-, Sult1d1-, and transgenic for human SULT1A1/2) for the activation of 1-HMP in the mutagenicity assay. The most prominent impacts of the genetic SULT status were 96% decrease in hepatic activation by Sult1a1 knockout, 99% decrease in renal activation by Sult1d1 knockout, and 100-fold increase in pulmonary activation by transgenic human SULT1A1/2. Finally, we treated the various mouse lines with 1-HMP (19.3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and then determined 1-SMP levels in plasma and DNA adducts in tissues. Transgenic human SULT1A1/2 strongly enhanced 1-SMP plasma levels and DNA adduct formation in the liver, lung, heart, and kidney but not in the colon. Sult1a1 and Sult1d1 knockout reduced plasma 1-SMP levels as well as DNA adduct formation in some tissues (strongest effects: 97% decrease in 1-SMP and 89% decrease in hepatic adducts in Sult1a1- mice). The adduct levels detected in various tissues did not accurately reflect the activation capacity of these tissues determined in vitro, probably due to the distribution of the reactive metabolite 1-SMP via the circulation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that many mouse SULT forms are able to activate 1-HMP. In vivo, we verified a prominent role of Sult1a1 in hepatic and renal adduct formation and a smaller but unambiguous role of Sult1d1, and demonstrated the strong impact of transgenic human SULT1A1/2.
Early-onset hypertensive disorders (HD) of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age infants (SGA) are associated with placental vascular thrombosis, these often recur and are also associated with inheritable thrombophilia. Aspirin reduces the recurrence risk.
Adding low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to aspirin at < 12 weeks gestation reduces the recurrence of HD in women with previous early-onset HD (pre-eclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets [HELLP] syndrome and eclampsia) and/or SGA, in the context of inheritable thrombophilia without antiphospholipid antibodies.
In a multicenter randomized control trial (RCT), 139 women included were< 12 weeks gestation.
previous delivery< 34 weeks gestation with HD and/or SGA; inheritable thrombophilia (protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, activated protein C resistance, factor V Leiden heterozygosity and prothrombin gene G20210A mutation heterozygosity); and no antiphospholipid antibodies detected.
either daily LMWH (dalteparin, 5000 IU weight-adjusted dosage) with aspirin 80 mg or aspirin 80 mg alone.
