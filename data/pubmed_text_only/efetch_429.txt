Acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts are a widely recognized correlate of acetaminophen-mediated hepatic injury in laboratory animals. The objective of this study was to use a new assay for the detection of acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts in children with acute liver failure to determine the role of acetaminophen toxicity in acute liver failure of unknown cause.
Serum samples from children with acute liver failure were measured for acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. For comparison, samples from children with well-characterized acetaminophen toxicity and children with known other causes of acute liver failure also were measured for acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts. The analytical laboratory was blinded to patient diagnoses.
Acetaminophen cysteine protein adduct was detected in 90% of samples from children with acute liver failure that was attributed to acetaminophen toxicity, 12.5% of samples from children with acute liver failure of indeterminate cause, and 9.6% of samples from children with acute liver failure that was attributed to other causes. Adduct-positive patients from the indeterminate cause subgroup had higher levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase and lower levels of bilirubin. Adduct-positive patients also had lower rates of transplantation and higher rates of spontaneous remission.
A small but significant percentage of children with acute liver failure of indeterminate cause tested positive for acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts, strongly suggesting acetaminophen toxicity as the cause of acute liver failure. An assay for the detection of acetaminophen cysteine protein adducts can aid the diagnosis of acetaminophen-related liver injury in children.
Cutaneous lesions caused by Leishmania braziliensis infection occasionally heal spontaneously, but with antimonials therapy heal rapidly in approximately 3 weeks. However, about 15% of the cases require several courses of therapy. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 are gelatinases that have been implicated in other chronic cutaneous diseases and skin re-epithelialization. These enzymes are controlled by their natural inhibitors [tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs)] and by some cytokines. Uncontrolled gelatinase activity may result in intense tissue degradation and, consequently, poorly healing wounds. The present study correlates gelatinase activity to therapeutic failure of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) lesions. Our results demonstrate an association between gelatinase activity and increased numbers of cells making interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in lesions from poor responders. Conversely, high levels of MMP-2 mRNA and enhanced MMP-2 : TIMP-2 ratios were associated with a satisfactory response to antimonials treatment. Additionally, high gelatinolytic activity was found in the wound beds, necrotic areas in the dermis and within some granulomatous infiltrates. These results indicate the importance of gelatinase activity in the skin lesions caused by CL. Thus, we hypothesize that the immune response profile may be responsible for the gelatinase activity pattern and may ultimately influence the persistence or cure of CL lesions.
In order to evaluate the role of metallothionein (MT)-III in cadmium (Cd)-induced testicular toxicity, we examined the sensitivity of MT-III null mice to severe testicular injury caused by Cd.
Male MT-III null mice, MT-I/II null mice and wild-type mice were given a subcutaneous injection of CdCl(2) (15μmol/kg). The testis was collected from each mouse at 6, 12 and 24h after Cd administration.
Testicular hemorrhages by evaluating morphology, hemoglobin content and histological parameters in the 3 types of mice were elevated by Cd injection in a time-dependent manner. The degree of hemorrhage in Cd-injected MT-I/II null mice was similar to that in the wild-type mice. In contrast, hemorrhage in the MT-III null mice was attenuated compared with that in wild-type mice and MT-I/II null mice. Cd levels, MT-I and MT-II mRNA levels and Cd-binding molecules in the testis were similar between MT-III null mice and wild-type mice. In microarray analysis, high expression of purine-nucleoside phosphorylase 2 (Pnp2), retinal degeneration 3 (Rd3), and cadherin-like 24 (Cdh24) was revealed in the testis of MT-III null mice under normal or Cd-treated conditions.
MT-III null mice were found to show attenuation of Cd-induced severe testicular toxicity. These results suggest the lack of MT-III contributes to protection of testis from Cd. In addition, regulation of Pnp2, Rd3, and Cdh24 mRNA levels may involve the sensitivity of MT-III null mice to Cd.
The products of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) play a critical role in determining vessel wall structure and function. Polymorphisms in both genes have been independently demonstrated to influence propensity to cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of the homozygous G849T (Glu298-->Asp) polymorphism in NOS III on peripheral conduit artery endothelial function and to elucidate the modifier role, if any, of a common ACE polymorphism. Three hundred and ninety-seven consecutive subjects presenting to the cardiac catheterization laboratory of the University of Michigan over a period of 18 months were recruited. DNA was extracted and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for ACE and NOS polymorphisms performed. Patients with homozygosity for G849T at both loci (TT) who belong to DD and II ACE genotype (groups 1 and 2) and those who are negative for this polymorphism (GG) and belong to either DD or II genotype (groups 3 and 4) were identified. The four groups then underwent determination of conduit endothelial function. Heterozygosity of Glu298-Asp or the ID variant of the ACE were not studied. Median FMD value in the TT-DD group was 0.20 (-3.17, 2.01) compared with 2.23% (-0.29, 4.17) in the GG-II group. Median values in the TT-II and the GG-DD groups were 3.04 (-1.16, 6.61) and 2.46% (-1.83, 6.52) respectively. These values were not statistically significant (p > 0.05 by one-way ANOVA). Median nitroglycerin-mediated dilation in the four groups did not differ between the four groups (p = NS by ANOVA). Atherosclerosis burdens as assessed by angiography were not different across the groups. In conclusion, the homozygous NOS III variant (GG) status does not seem to interact additively with the ACE homozygous DD genotype in determining flow-mediated vasodilation in individuals with established atherosclerosis and pre-existent endothelial dysfunction.
We reported a 50-year-old woman with a history of mixed connective tissue disease. She had two episodes of meningitis-like symptoms after taking famotidine and tiquizium bromide for treatment of gastric ulcer. From CSF findings (elevated pressure, increase of protein, polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, negative culture) and result of famotidine challenge test, we diagnosed her as a drug induced aseptic meningitis. Because she had taken tiquizium bromide several times previously without any side effects, we concluded that famotidine was a causative drug. She was recovered without sequelae within a few days following cessation of these drugs. This is the first report of H2-blocker induced aseptic meningitis. When we encounter a patient with aseptic meningitis who presents polymorphonuclear pleocytosis in CSF, we should suspect drug induced aseptic meningitis and take a history of drug medication including H2-blocker.
Histamine receptors are present in adrenergic terminals, and histamine is reported to inhibit release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) at certain neuroeffector junctions. However, a physiological role for histamine in modifying adrenergic neurotransmission has not been established. To examine the interaction of elevated plasma histamine and catecholamine release, two compounds that release histamine, morphine (3 mg/kg), and compound 48/80 (0.5 mg/kg), were administered intravenously (i.v.). Plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were used to monitor sympathetic nervous system activity, and plasma epinephrine (Epi) levels were used to monitor adrenal activity. Both morphine and compound 48/80 caused an immediate and marked increase in plasma histamine. Simultaneous with this increase, a marked decrease in mean arterial pressure occurred. Plasma NE levels increased in animals administered compound 48/80, but in morphine-treated animals, plasma NE levels did not change from pretreatment values. Plasma Epi levels increased in both groups, but the magnitude and duration of the responses differed. The results indicate that elevated plasma catecholamines can increase in response to histamine-induced hypotension but this effect can be suppressed by the central actions of morphine.
Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) is one of a class of industrial chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl acids, which have a wide variety of uses as surfactants and stain repellants. The presence of fluorochemical residues in human blood, plasma, or serum from sample populations worldwide is indicative of widespread human exposure. Previous studies demonstrated that PFOS alters fatty acid metabolism in the liver of rodents and that this leads to peroxisome proliferation. This study was undertaken to (1) confirm the effects of PFOS on rat liver, (2) identify additional target organs and systems, and (3) further explore the biochemical and molecular changes associated with PFOS exposure. The results confirmed that liver was a primary target for PFOS. Hepatomegaly, decreased serum triglycerides and cholesterol, and increased expression of the genes for acyl-coenzymeA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and cytochrome P-450 4A22 (CYP4A22) were indicative of exposure to a peroxisome proliferator. Changes in liver fatty acid profiles included increased total monounsaturated fatty acid levels and decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as an increase in linoleic acid levels and a decrease in longer chain fatty acids. These changes were similar to those induced by relatively weak peroxisome proliferators. Disruptions in hepatic fatty acid metabolism may contribute to changes in red blood cell membranes, resulting in increased lysis and cell fragility. Serum thyroid hormone levels were decreased in PFOS-treated rats, while the kidney and cardiovascular systems were not significant targets. Residue analyses indicated that PFOS accumulation in tissues was dose dependent, appearing preferentially in the liver at lower doses but increasing in serum and other organs relative to liver at higher doses.
To determine whether factors associated with postural tremor operate by altering muscle interstitial K(+).
An experimental approach was used to investigate the effects of procedures designed to increase or decrease interstitial K(+). Postural physiological tremor was measured by conventional means. Brief periods of ischaemic muscle activity were used to increase muscle interstitial K(+). Infusion of the beta(2) agonist terbutaline was used to decrease plasma (and interstitial) K(+). Blood samples were taken for the determination of plasma K(+).
Ischaemia rapidly reduced tremor size, but only when the muscle was active. The beta(2) agonist produced a slow and progressive rise in tremor size that was almost exactly mirrored by a slow and progressive decrease in plasma K(+).
Ischaemic reduction of postural tremor has been attributed to effects on muscle spindles or an unexplained effect on muscle. This study showed that ischaemia did not reduce tremor size unless there was accompanying muscular activity. An accumulation of K(+) in the interstitium of the ischaemic active muscle may blunt the response of the muscle and reduce its fusion frequency, so that the force output becomes less pulsatile and tremor size decreases. When a beta(2) agonist is infused, the rise in tremor mirrors the resultant decrease in plasma K(+). Decreased plasma K(+) reduces interstitial K(+) concentration and may produce greater muscular force fluctuation (more tremor). Many other factors that affect postural tremor size may exert their effect by altering plasma K(+) concentration, thereby changing the concentration of K(+) in the interstitial fluid.
We tested Mg2+ influence on experimental morphine-induced pharmacodependence in rats. Morphine-induced pharmacodependence model consists of progressively increased doses of morphine (M) (5 mg/kg i.p. until 90 mg/kg i.p.) during 10 days. Withdrawal syndrome was induced by naloxone (N) administration (1 mg/kg, s.c.) on the 11th day, 2 h after the last morphine administration. We evaluated and statistically interpreted symptoms from withdrawal syndrome. 2 groups received magnesium acetate (MgAc) 0.5 mEq/kg/day i.p. and 0.1 mEq/kg/day MgAc i.p. respectively during all 11 days of morphine-induced pharmacodependence. Serum magnesium levels were determined by spectrophotometry. Data obtained show that MgAc significantly decreases symptoms from withdrawal syndrome (grooming 19.9 +/- 2.1 in M + MgAc 0.5 mEq/kg/day vs. 33 +/- 2.85 in M group, p < 0.01).
No information is available regarding the significance of ventricular ectopic activity induced during dipyridamole nuclear scintigraphic stress testing. This study tested the hypothesis that dipyridamole-induced ventricular ectopy predicts a thallium-201 or technetium-99m sestamibi perfusion defect.
A group of 186 consecutive patients with premature ventricular contractions and/or couplets occurring during dipyridamole stress testing (ventricular tachycardia did not occur) was compared with a control group of 194 patients without ventricular ectopy during dipyridamole stress testing.
The results indicated that ventricular ectopy induced during dipyridamole infusion occurred more frequently in patients demonstrating either a fixed or reversible perfusion defect on scintigraphic imaging (p < 0.01). The higher frequency of perfusion defects in this group of patients was attributable to a higher frequency of "fixed" compared with "reversible" defects (p < 0.05). This finding is consistent with the additional observation that ventricular ectopy induced by dipyridamole was associated with the presence of Q waves on the resting ECG (p < 0.05). The positive and negative predictive values of the presence of ventricular ectopy in predicting a fixed myocardial perfusion defect were 59 and 54%, respectively.
Ventricular ectopy induced during dipyridamole infusion suggests the presence of a fixed myocardial perfusion defect.
Maternal obesity has adverse effects on oocyte quality, embryo development, and the health of the offspring.
To understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the negative effects of maternal obesity, we investigated the DNA methylation status of several imprinted genes and metabolism-related genes.
Using a high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced mouse model of obesity, we analyzed the DNA methylation of several imprinted genes and metabolism-related genes in oocytes from control and obese dams and in oocytes and liver from their offspring. Analysis was performed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing.
DNA methylation of imprinted genes in oocytes was not altered in either obese dams or their offspring; however, DNA methylation of metabolism-related genes was changed. In oocytes of obese mice, the DNA methylation level of the leptin (Lep) promoter was significantly increased and that of the Ppar-α promoter was reduced. Increased methylation of Lep and decreased methylation of Ppar-α was also observed in the liver of female offspring from dams fed the high-fat diet (OHFD). mRNA expression of Lep and Ppar-α was also significantly altered in the liver of these OHFD. In OHFD oocytes, the DNA methylation level of Ppar-α promoter was increased.
Our results indicate that DNA methylation patterns of several metabolism-related genes are changed not only in oocytes of obese mice but also in oocytes and liver of their offspring. These data may contribute to the understanding of adverse effects of maternal obesity on reproduction and health of the offspring.
Acute ethanol ingestion can prolong the PR interval, but searching Medline, we have found only one report of Wenckebach-type atrioventricular block in ethanol poisoning. We present a high-degree atrioventricular block in an ethanol-poisoned patient.
A 17-year-old woman with a non-contributory medical history ingested 3dcl of vodka and was found comatose. On arrival she was somnolent with nausea, tympanic temperature 36.0 degrees C, pulse 70 counts/min, blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 12 counts/min and SpO(2) 96% on room air. Her blood ethanol level was 130 mg/dL; other blood laboratory test results were normal. ECG revealed sinus rhythm, first-degree atrioventricular block with a PR interval of 0.32 seconds and intermittent second- and third-degree atrioventricular blocks with up to 4-second-long pauses that appeared 15-30 seconds after each vomiting. She was given thiethylperazine and vomiting resolved within an hour. ECG 12 hours after admission revealed a first-degree atrioventricular block with a PR interval of 0.24 seconds. One month later Holter monitor showed a sinus rhythm and first-degree atrioventricular block with a PR interval of 0.21 seconds. Vagal maneuvers did not provoke high-degree atrioventricular block. The echocardiogram was normal.
Acute ethanol poisoning has the potential to prolong the PR interval in adults with first-degree atrioventricular block and provoke intermittent second- and third-degree atrioventricular blocks, possibly by its direct inhibitory action on the conduction system and increasing parasympathetic tone due to nausea and vomiting.
A 47-year-old man with a history of polyarticular gout was admitted to the nephrology service because of severe renal insufficiency (creatinine 6.25 mg/dl). Three days before admission he had a pain crisis in his knees and ankles and self-administered 20 x 1 mg granules of colchicine p.o. over a period of 4 - 5 hours together with six suppositories each containing 100 mg of indomethacin. The patient began vomiting within 24 hours, experienced diarrhea which persisted for three days and then came to the hospital. The patient reported oliguria during the preceding 24 hours. In hospital, attempts to correct water and electrolyte balance were initiated. The patient became stabilized hemo-dynamically, the diarrhea disappeared within 24 hours, diuresis resumed and the renal function progressively improved. Leukopenia and thrombopenia were diagnosed, the transaminases increased: AST = 79 U/l, ALT = 132 U/l on the eighth day after taking the colchicine. The serology for hepatitis A, B, C and HIV viruses was negative; the serology for CMV and VEB revealed a previous infection. After being discharged from hospital 11 days after admission, the patient presented with the following parameters: hematocrit 39%, leukocytes 5,920/microl (3 470 neutrophils), prothrombin time 13 seconds, urea 44 mg/dl, creatinine 1.29 mg/dl, AST 16 U/l and ALT 35 U/l.
The patient mistakenly ingested 20 mg ofcolchicine p.o. (0.22 mg/kg). The intoxication was associated with gastroenterocolitis, dehydration and renal failure during the first three days after ingestion. The patient also developed leukopenia, thrombopenia and mild hepatocellular injury. Renal failure due to colchicine intoxication is due to various factors such as depletion of volume/hypotension, rhabdomyolysis and multiorgan failure. In this case, the hypovolemia was probably the fundamental cause of the acute renal insufficiency as demonstrated by the quick recovery after administering fluids. It is possible that indomethacin may have enhanced the toxic effect of colchicine on the kidneys and bone marrow. Some colchicine intoxications, as in this case, are caused by an error in interpreting the dose for treating an acute attack of gout. A way to prevent these errors would be to use a low-dose treatment protocol.
Captopril, the competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, has proved efficient in the treatment of arterial hypertension and heart failure. Its use is generally associated with low incidence of adverse reactions and hepatic injury has not been emphasized as an important adverse reaction in Denmark. However worldwide, several cases of hepatic injury have been reported. We report one case of Captopril-induced hepatic injury. Despite discontinuation of Captopril a hepatorenal syndrome developed and the patient died five weeks after admission. This report emphasizes the need to be aware of the possibility of hepatic injury in patients receiving Captopril.
Although ambient fine particulate matter (PM(2.5); particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter) has been linked to adverse human health effects, the chemical constituents that cause harm are unknown. To our knowledge, the health effects of PM(2.5) constituents have not been reported for a developing country.
We examined the short-term association between PM(2.5) constituents and daily mortality in Xi'an, a heavily polluted Chinese city.
We obtained daily mortality data and daily concentrations of PM(2.5), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and 10 water-soluble ions for 1 January 2004 through 31 December 2008. We also measured concentrations of fifteen elements 1 January 2006 through 31 December 2008. We analyzed the data using overdispersed generalized linear Poisson models.
During the study period, the mean daily average concentration of PM(2.5) in Xi'an was 182.2 µg/m³. Major contributors to PM(2.5) mass included OC, EC, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. After adjustment for PM(2.5) mass, we found significant positive associations of total, cardiovascular, or respiratory mortality with OC, EC, ammonium, nitrate, chlorine ion, chlorine, and nickel for at least one lag period. Nitrate demonstrated stronger associations with total and cardiovascular mortality than PM(2.5) mass. For a 1-day lag, interquartile range increases in PM(2.5) mass and nitrate (114.9 and 15.4 µg/m³, respectively) were associated with 1.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8%, 2.8%] and 3.8% (95% CI: 1.7%, 5.9%) increases in total mortality.
Our findings suggest that PM(2.5) constituents from the combustion of fossil fuel may have an appreciable influence on the health effects attributable to PM(2.5) in Xi'an.
For treating Leishmania major infection in BALB/c mice, we used thalidomide in conjunction with glucantime. Groups of mice were challenged with 510(3) metacyclic promastigotes of L. major subcutaneously. A week after the challenge, drug treatment was started and continued for 12 days. Thalidomide was orally administrated 30 mg/kg/day and glucantime was administrated intraperitoneally (200 mg/kg/day). It was shown that the combined therapy is more effective than single therapies with each one of the drugs since the foot pad swelling in the group of mice received thalidomide and glucantime was significantly decreased (0.9 +/- 0.2 mm) compared to mice treated with either glucantime, thalidomide, or carrier alone (1.2 +/- 0.25, 1.4 +/- 0.3, and 1.7 +/- 0.27 mm, respectively). Cytokine study showed that the effect of thalidomide was not dependent on IL-12; however, it up-regulated IFN-gamma and down-regulated IL-10 production. Conclusively, thalidomide seems promising as a conjunctive therapy with antimony in murine model of visceral leishmaniasis.
Hemorrhagic events in patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction are well known. We report a case of acute compression of the median nerve caused by a hematoma in the carpal tunnel following infusion of streptokinase in a 71 year-old man with acute myocardial infarction. Operative decompression was carried out. The postoperative course was uneventful, with complete recovery from symptoms of median nerve entrapment.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic bile duct disease affecting 2.4-7.5% of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. We performed a genome-wide association analysis of 2,466,182 SNPs in 715 individuals with PSC and 2,962 controls, followed by replication in 1,025 PSC cases and 2,174 controls. We detected non-HLA associations at rs3197999 in MST1 and rs6720394 near BCL2L11 (combined P = 1.1 × 10⁻¹⁶ and P = 4.1 × 10⁻⁸, respectively).
Amino acid concentrations were measured in specific structures from the brains of rats decapitated before and during the course of status epilepticus induced by lithium and pilocarpine, with the stages of status defined by the electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern displayed. Early status was marked by discrete seizures on EEG, mid status by continuous spiking, and late status by periodic epileptiform discharges. Aspartate levels were lower than control levels in most regions prior to the onset of status. The decline continued and reached statistical significance in different regions at times from early to late status. Glutamate concentrations were typically higher than control just prior to status onset and then decreased in a manner similar to aspartate, but with less percentage change. gamma-Aminobutyric acid increased during status, with the earliest statistically significant differences observed in mid status. These changes were observed in most forebrain structures studied, but the largest percentage changes in excitatory amino acid concentration were found in substantia nigra, where they fell to less than half of control.
Neuritic plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients are characterized by beta-amyloid deposits associated with a glia-mediated inflammatory response. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy reduces Alzheimer's disease risk and ameliorates microglial reactivity in Alzheimer's disease brains; however, the molecular mechanisms subserving this effect are not yet clear. Since several NSAIDs bind to and activate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) which acts to inhibit the expression of proinflammatory genes, this receptor appears a good candidate to mediate the observed anti-inflammatory effects. Recent data in vitro suggested that NSAIDs negatively regulate microglial activation and immunostimulated amyloid precursor protein processing via PPARgamma activation. We report that an acute 7 day oral treatment of 10-month-old APPV717I mice with the PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone or the NSAID ibuprofen resulted in a reduction in the number of activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus and cortex. Drug treatment reduced the expression of the proinflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In parallel to the suppression of inflammatory markers, pioglitazone and ibuprofen treatment decreased beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, we observed a significant reduction of the total area and staining intensity of Abeta1-42-positive amyloid deposits in the hippocampus and cortex. Additionally, animals treated with pioglitazone revealed a 27% reduction in the levels of soluble Abeta1-42 peptide. These findings demonstrate that anti-inflammatory drugs can act rapidly to inhibit inflammatory responses in the brain and negatively modulate amyloidogenesis.
Triadimefon, propiconazole, and myclobutanil are conazoles, an important class of agricultural fungicides. Triadimefon and propiconazole are mouse liver tumorigens, while myclobutanil is not. As part of a coordinated study to understand the molecular determinants of conazole tumorigenicity, we analyzed the microRNA expression levels in control and conazole-treated mice after 90 d of administration in feed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs composed of approximately 19-24 nucleotides in length, and have been shown to interact with mRNA (usually 3' UTR) to suppress its expression. MicroRNAs play a key role in diverse biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Groups of mice were fed either control diet or diet containing 1800 ppm triadimefon, 2500 ppm propiconazole, or 2000 ppm myclobutanil. MicroRNA was isolated from livers and analyzed using Superarray whole mouse genome miRNA PCR arrays from SABioscience. Data were analyzed using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) procedure. We identified those miRNAs whose expression was either increased or decreased relative to untreated controls with q < or = 0.01. The tumorigenic conazoles induced many more changes in miRNA expression than the nontumorigenic conazole. A group of 19 miRNAs was identified whose expression was significantly altered in both triadimefon- and propiconazole-treated animals but not in myclobutanil-treated animals. All but one of the altered miRNAs were downregulated compared to controls. This pattern of altered miRNA expression may represent a signature for tumorigenic conazole exposure in mouse liver after 90 d of treatment.
Species are endowed with unique sensory capabilities that are encoded by divergent neural circuits. One potential explanation for how divergent circuits have evolved is that conserved extrinsic signals are differentially interpreted by developing neurons of different species to yield unique patterns of axonal connections. Although nerve growth factor (NGF) controls survival, maturation and axonal projections of nociceptors of different vertebrates, whether the NGF signal is differentially transduced in different species to yield unique features of nociceptor circuits is unclear. We identified a species-specific signaling module induced by NGF and mediated by a rapidly evolving Hox transcription factor, Hoxd1. NGF promoted robust expression of Hoxd1 in mice, but not chickens, both in vivo and in vitro. Mice lacking Hoxd1 displayed altered nociceptor circuitry that resembles that normally found in chicks. Conversely, ectopic expression of Hoxd1 in developing chick nociceptors promoted a pattern of axonal projections reminiscent of the mouse. Thus, conserved growth factors control divergent neuronal transcriptional events that mediate interspecies differences in neural circuits and the behaviors that they control.
The effect of estrogen withdrawal on pituitary glands of rats treated with estradiol-17 beta for various lengths of time was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological examination. Estrogen pellets were removed at seven different time points ranging from 4 to 206 days after pellet implantation. High-resolution mid-sagittal MR images of the rat head were made 1 day before pellet implantation, immediately following pellet withdrawal, and 14 and 28 days after pellet withdrawal. Twenty-eight days after pellet withdrawal pituitary glands were fixed and processed for histological examination. Enlarged pituitaries were detected by MRI from 16 days after implantation and onwards. Twenty-eight days after estrogen withdrawal the typical triangular shape of the normal pituitary had returned and pituitary morphology was indistinguishable from that of normal pituitaries in all rats that had been treated with estrogen for up to 114 days. Pituitaries of rats that had received estrogen for 186 days had a normal MR image 28 days after estrogen withdrawal, but microscopic examination revealed multifocal hyperplasias of prolactin-positive cells throughout the pars distalis. MRI of rats treated for 206 days showed tumorously enlarged pituitaries. There was no evidence of tumor regression in these rats 28 days after pellet removal. It was concluded that hypertrophic pituitaries regained a normal size, shape and morphology after estrogen withdrawal, except for a remarkable type of hyperplasia following estrogen treatment for 186 days and a recovery period of 28 days. In tumorous pituitaries no regression of lesions was noticed.
Immunohistochemical staining of enoyl CoA hydratase (ECH), a key peroxisomal enzyme, revealed that the putative preneoplastic lesions induced in livers by administration of the peroxisome proliferator (PP) clofibrate (0.3% in diet) to rats for 60 weeks or more, lacked this enzyme so that they could be detected as ECH-negative foci. ECH and other peroxisomal enzymes such as acyl CoA oxidase, catalase and carnitine-dependent acetyltransferase were also either not or only weakly expressed in most hepatic hyperplastic nodules and hepatomas induced by ciprofibrate (0.025% in diet), Wy-14,643 (0.1%) or BR-931 (0.2%), while being strongly induced in surrounding hepatocytes. These results indicate that the expression of ECH and other peroxisomal enzymes is repressed in putative preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions induced by PPs in rat livers and that these peroxisomal enzymes might therefore be used as negative markers.
