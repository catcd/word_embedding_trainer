We describe a case of neurologic manifestations including coma, convulsion and eye movement disorders, associated with hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia in a patient treated with cisplatin for an ovarian adenocarcinoma. Pathophysiological mechanisms involve renal tubular damage leading to renal magnesium wasting and related hypocalcemia.
Halitosis affects a large proportion of the population and is, in most cases, caused by the production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), particularly methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide, by specific bacterial species colonizing the oral cavity. In this study, a supercritical extract of Chinese licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), and its major isoflavans, licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, were investigated for their effect on growth, VSC production and protease activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Solobacterium moorei, which have been associated with halitosis. The effects of licorice extract, licoricidin, and licorisoflavan A on VSC production in a saliva model were also tested. We first showed that licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, and to a lesser extent the licorice extract, were effective in inhibiting the growth of all three bacterial species, with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the range of 2-80 µg ml(-1). The licorice extract and the two isolates licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, were able to dose-dependently reduce VSC production by P. gingivalis, Prev. intermedia, and S. moorei as well as by a human saliva model. Although the extract and isolates did not inhibit the proteolytic activity of bacteria, they blocked the conversion of cysteine into hydrogen sulfide by Prev. intermedia. Lastly, the deodorizing effects of the licorice extract, licoricidin, and licorisoflavan A were demonstrated, as they can neutralize P. gingivalis-derived VSCs. Licorisoflavan A (10 µg ml(-1)) was found to be the most effective by reducing VSC levels by 50%. Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that a licorice supercritical extract and its major isoflavans (licoricidin and licorisoflavan A) represent natural ingredients with a potential for reducing bacterial VSC production and therefore for controlling halitosis.
We describe a fetus with a hypoplastic right ventricle detected by prenatal ultrasound examination. A possible causal relationship with prenatal valproate exposure is discussed.
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is 1 of the possible factors linking obesity and diabetes with cardiovascular disease, however, the mechanism of the increase in ICAM-1 concentration in obesity remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess plasma soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) levels in obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance and to evaluate whether those levels may be related to insulin resistance and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) system activity. The study was performed in 8 lean and 15 obese subjects. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured, and insulin sensitivity was evaluated using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique (insulin infusion, 50 mU x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Obese subjects were markedly more hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant and had higher plasma soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2) and sICAM-1 levels. sICAM-1 was related positively to body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), percent of body fat, glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), plasma insulin and triglycerides (TG), TNFalpha, and sTNFR2 and negatively to insulin sensitivity. Multiple regression analysis showed that only sTNFR2 and insulin sensitivity were independent predictors of sICAM-1 concentrations and were responsible for 66% of sICAM-1 variability. We conclude that an increase in plasma sICAM-1 concentration in obesity is related to TNFalpha system activation and insulin resistance.
Dextromethorphan, dimemorfan, dihydrocodeine and oxymethebanol, centrally acting antitussives, were examined for their effect on Ehrlich carcinoma cells and sarcoma-180 cells in vitro or in vivo. The tumor cells were suspended in Hanks balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) supplemented with 2% bovine albumin, and they were incubated with and without 1 mM drugs at 37 degrees C for 120 min. The incubation of the tumor cells with dextromethorphan or dimemorfan resulted in a decrease in the proportion of the viable cells (less than 25% after 120 min). However, no significant change was observed in the proportion of the viable tumor cells during the incubation with and without the other drugs (80-83% after 120 min). In addition, mice given the tumor cells i.p. were injected intraperitoneally with drugs (20-80 mg/kg/day) once daily for 5 successive days, and their survival time was observed. There was a slight difference in the survival time between mice treated with and without dextromethorphan or dimemorfan. However, a significant difference was found in the survival time between mice treated with and without dextromethorphan when mice given Ehrlich carcinoma cells were injected with the drug (40 mg/kg/time) twice a day for 5 days (about 18 days and 29 days). These results indicate that dextromethorphan and dimemorfan are cytotoxic to the tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.
Repeated and acute exposure studies assessed time and concentration-dependencies of nasal responses to formaldehyde. Exposures were to 0, 0.7, 2, and 6 ppm for 6 h/day, 5 days/week for up to 3 weeks. Neither cell proliferation nor histopathology was observed at 0.7 ppm. At 6 ppm, cell proliferation increased at the end of the first week (day 5), but not at the end of week 3 (day 15). Squamous metaplasia occurred at day 5; epithelial hyperplasia occurred at both day 5 and day 15. In microarray studies, no genes were altered at 0.7 ppm. At 2 ppm, 15 genes were changed on day 5; only half of them were changed at 6 ppm. No genes were changed significantly at 2 ppm at day 15. The pattern of gene changes at 2 and 6 ppm, with transient squamous metaplasia at day 5, indicated tissue adaptation and reduced tissue sensitivity by day 15. The acute study included an additional concentration (15 ppm) and an instillation group (40 microl, 400 mM per nostril). Three times more genes were affected by instillation than inhalation. U-shaped dose responses were noted in the acute study for many genes that were also altered at 2 ppm on day 5. On the basis of cellular component gene ontology benchmark dose analysis, the most sensitive changes were for genes were associated with extracellular components and plasma membrane. With formaldehyde, there are temporal and concentration-dependent transitions in epithelial responses and genomic signatures between 0.7 and 6 ppm. Low concentrations primarily affect extracellular matrix or external plasma membrane portions of the epithelium.
This experiment examined the effects of nicotine on flash-evoked potentials (FEPs) recorded from both the visual cortex (VC) and the superior colliculus (SC) of chronically implanted male Long-Evans rats. FEPs were recorded at 5, 20, 40, and 60 min following subcutaneous injections of saline, and of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 mg/kg nicotine on separate days. In the VC, the amplitude of components N(39), N(53), N(67), and P(88) increased, while the amplitude of components N(30) and P(235) decreased following nicotine administration. P(22), P(47), and N(153) were unchanged. In the SC, components P(27), N(48), and N(53) were reduced in amplitude, while P(37) and N(57) were unaffected by nicotine. Many peak latencies in the VC and SC were increased by nicotine, often at all three doses. However, effects of nicotine on FEPs were both dose- and time-dependent. When body temperature was recorded 65 min after drug administration, significant hypothermia was found with both the 0.7- and 1.0-mg/kg nicotine doses. The 1.0-mg/kg dose of nicotine resulted in a significant increase in movement during the recording sessions, but not in subsequent open-field observations. The results demonstrate that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a differential role in the production/modulation of the various components of FEPs.
It was recently reported that administration of relatively high intensities of footshock (overreinforcement) during training of passive avoidance protected animals against the amnesic effect of scopolamine, injected 5 min after training. This was interpreted in terms of a lesser involvement of acetylcholine in memory consolidation. An alternative explanation was that overreinforcement accelerated the consolidation process, which could have taken place before the injection of scopolamine. To test for this possibility, male Wistar rats were injected with 4, 8, or 12 mg/kg of scopolamine, 5 min before training with low or high levels of footshock and then tested for retention of the task. Scopolamine induced the expected memory deficit after the low-intensity footshock; after overreinforcement the higher doses of scopolamine induced state dependency, while no deficits were produced with the lower dose. It was concluded that: (a) acetylcholine is indeed involved in memory consolidation of passive avoidance; (b) scopolamine interacts with high footshock levels to produce state dependency; and (c) when relatively low doses of scopolamine are used in conditions of overreinforcement, protection against scopolamine-induced amnesia becomes evident.
Eighty-one renal, seventeen heart, and twenty-four liver transplant patients were followed for infection. Seventeen renal patients received azathioprine (Aza) and prednisone as part of a randomized trial of immunosuppression with 21 cyclosporine-and-prednisone-treated renal transplant patients. All others received cyclosporine and prednisone. The randomized Aza patients had more overall infections (P less than 0.05) and more nonviral infections (P less than 0.02) than the randomized cyclosporine patients. Heart and liver patients had more infections than cyclosporine renal patients but fewer infections than the Aza renal patients. There were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine or Aza, but infection played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant deaths. Renal patients on cyclosporine had the fewest bacteremias. Analysis of site of infection showed a preponderance of abdominal infections in liver patients, intrathoracic infections in heart patients, and urinary tract infections in renal patients. Pulmonary infections were less common in cyclosporine-treated renal patients than in Aza-treated patients (P less than 0.05). Aza patients had significantly more staphylococcal infections than all other transplant groups (P less than 0.005), and systemic fungal infections occurred only in the liver transplant group. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) shedding or serological rises in antibody titer, or both occurred in 78% of cyclosporine patients and 76% of Aza patients. Of the cyclosporine patients, 15% had symptoms related to CMV infection. Serological evidence for Epstein Barr Virus infection was found in 20% of 65 cyclosporine patients studied. Three had associated symptoms, and one developed a lymphoma.
Oral contraceptives are known to have ocular complications including retinal vascular lesions. The authors report a case of central retinal artery occlusion in a young woman on oral contraceptives.
The purpose of the present study was to examine the clearance of methotrexate (MTX) by high-flux hemodialysis (HD) in pediatric oncology patients. We present three patients who experienced nephrotoxicity and prolonged exposure to toxic MTX concentrations following high-dose infusions during treatment for osteogenic sarcomas. Each patient was successfully treated with high-flux HD, followed by carboxypeptidase G2 (CPDG2) in two cases. Minimal systemic toxicity occurred. We review the literature and discuss guidelines for early and aggressive treatment for this complication of high-dose MTX therapy. Clinically important removal of MTX depends upon prompt initiation of HD after detection of nephrotoxicity and delayed clearance of MTX. Therapy is indicated in cases where compassionate use of CPDG(2) may not be available, or while awaiting its delivery.
Gallium arsenide (GaAs), an intermetallic semiconductor finds widespread applications in high frequency microwave and millimeter wave, and ultra fast supercomputers. Extensive use of GaAs has led to increased exposure to humans working in semiconductor industry. GaAs has the ability to dissociate into its constitutive moieties at physiological pH and might be responsible for the oxidative stress. The present study was aimed at evaluating, the principle moiety (Ga or As) in GaAs to cause neurological dysfunction based on its ability to cause apoptosis, in vivo and in vitro and if this neuronal dysfunction translated to neurobehavioral changes in chronically exposed rats. Result indicated that arsenic moiety in GaAs was mainly responsible for causing oxidative stress via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) generation, both in vitro and in vivo. Increased ROS further caused apoptosis via mitochondrial driven pathway. Effects of oxidative stress were also confirmed based on alterations in antioxidant enzymes, GPx, GST and SOD in rat brain. We noted that ROS induced oxidative stress caused changes in the brain neurotransmitter levels, Acetylcholinesterase and nitric oxide synthase, leading to loss of memory and learning in rats. The study demonstrates for the first time that the slow release of arsenic moiety from GaAs is mainly responsible for oxidative stress induced apoptosis in neuronal cells causing behavioral changes.
We describe a case of propylene glycol toxicity due to intravenous administration of etomidate for cerebral protection. A continuous etomidate infusion was titrated to burst suppression of the electroencephalogram during surgical resection of a large intracranial arteriovenous malformation. The etomidate formulation used (Amidate, Abbot) contains etomidate 2 mg/ml in a 35% propylene glycol vehicle. A total of 5 g/kg of the solvent was given during 12 h. Adverse effects of propylene glycol were observed including hyperosmolality with an increased osmolal gap, hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and metabolic acidosis. Normalization of these metabolic and ionic alterations occurred after 12 h of discontinuation of the infusion. The potential toxicity of the solvent should be considered during long-term administration of etomidate.
In the treatment of hypertension in subjects of African origins, although hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is not as effective as calcium channel blockers, indapamide is superior to HCTZ. In the present study we therefore compared the effects of slow release (SR) indapamide with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, when used as initial therapy, on blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass (LVM) during 6 months of treatment in this group.
Patients with a mean daytime ambulatory diastolic BP > or =90 mm Hg and < or =110 mm Hg (n = 125, aged 53 +/- 11 years, 68% women) were randomized to receive open-label 1.5 mg of indapamide SR or 5 mg of amlodipine. If daytime ambulatory diastolic BP at 1 month was >/=90 mm Hg, 4 mg of perindopril was added to indapamide SR or the dose of amlodipine was increased to 10 mg.
After 1 month of therapy, there was an equivalent decline in systolic and diastolic BP in both groups (P <.0001). In the indapamide-treated group (n = 62) the daytime BP decreased from 153 +/- 12/101 +/- 6 mm Hg to 138 +/- 15/92 +/- 10 mm Hg and for amlodipine (n = 58), it decreased from 152 +/- 13/99 +/- 5 mm Hg to 138 +/- 12/91 +/- 8 mm Hg. At 6 months daytime ambulatory BP decreased to 130 +/- 15/86 +/- 8 mm Hg and to 129 +/- 11/85 +/- 5 mm Hg for the indapamide SR (n = 42) and amlodipine (n = 44) treatment groups, respectively. Both groups showed equivalent regression of LVM index and relative wall thickness.
These data suggest that in hypertensive patients of African ancestry initiating therapy with 1.5 mg of indapamide SR and then adding 4 mg of perindopril is equally as effective as amlodipine therapy at reducing BP, and modifying target organ damage.
Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and oxidative stress are reported to be associated with adverse reproductive outcomes. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a polymorphic supergene family involved in the detoxification of numerous toxins including OCPs. OCPs are endocrine disrupter and prenatal exposure to them may be associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR). The objectives of the present study were (i) to determine the frequencies of polymorphic alleles of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in women with idiopathic FGR, (ii) to analyze the maternal and cord blood levels of the OCPs, and (iii) to identify the gene environment interaction that increases the risk of FGR.
Maternal and cord blood samples of 50 FGR cases (birth weight <10 percentile for gestational age as per Lubchenco's growth chart) and equal number of normal pregnancies who were occupationally non exposed to OCPs and excluding all the known high risk factors such as anemia, hypertension, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, medical disease, dietary habit, living style, parity, and BMI. The collected samples at the time of delivery/after delivery were analyzed for OCPs levels by gas chromatography and polymorphic analysis for GSTM1/GSTT1 gene using multiplex PCR.
Significantly higher levels of α,β,γ-HCH and p,p'-DDT were found in maternal blood and significantly higher levels of β and γ-HCH and p,p'-DDT were found in cord blood of FGR cases as compared to controls. The genotypic distribution of GSTM1/GSTT1 was almost similar in both the groups, but the frequency of GSTM1-/GSTT1- (null) genotype was significantly higher in FGR cases as compared to controls (p<0.05, OR=6.42). When interaction between GSTM1/GSTT1 genes polymorphism-OCPs levels and birth weight (gene-environment interaction) was ascertained, a significant association was seen between β-HCH and GSTM1- genotype with reduction in birth weight of 213g.
Higher levels of OCPs in pregnant women may be considered as an important aetiological factor in 'idiopathic' FGR. GST polymorphism can influence the relationship between prenatal exposure to pesticides and FGR. The present study provides evidence that polymorphism in xenobiotic metabolising genes may modify the effect of environmental health hazards and increase the risk of FGR.
The retinoic acid receptor beta 2 (RARbeta2) gene modulates proliferation and survival of cultured human breast cancer cells. Previously we showed that ectopic expression of RARbeta2 in a mouse xenograft model prevented metastasis, even in the absence of the ligand, all-trans retinoic acid. We investigated both cultured cells and xenograft tumors in order to delineate the gene expression profiles responsible for an antimetastatic phenotype.
RNA from MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells transduced with RARbeta2 or empty retroviral vector (LXSN) was analyzed using Agilent Human 1A Oligo microarrays. The one hundred probes with the greatest differential intensity (p < 0.004, jointly) were determined by selecting the top median log ratios from eight-paired microarrays. Validation of differences in expression was done using Northern blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We determined expression of selected genes in xenograft tumors.
RARbeta2 cells exhibit gene profiles with overrepresentation of genes from Xq28 (p = 2 x 10(-8)), a cytogenetic region that contains a large portion of the cancer/testis antigen gene family. Other functions or factors impacted by the presence of exogenous RARbeta2 include mediators of the immune response and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Thirteen of fifteen (87%) of the genes evaluated in xenograft tumors were consistent with differences we found in the cell cultures (p = 0.007).
Antimetastatic RARbeta2 signalling, direct or indirect, results in an elevation of expression for genes such as tumor-cell antigens (CTAG1 and CTAG2), those involved in innate immune response (e.g., RIG-I/DDX58), and tumor suppressor functions (e.g., TYRP1). Genes whose expression is diminished by RARbeta2 signalling include cell adhesion functions (e.g, CD164) nutritional or metabolic processes (e.g., FABP6), and the transcription factor, JUN.
To determine pain patterns and relationships in patients with herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia before and after topical application of aspirin dissolved in chloroform applied to the painful skin surface.
A consecutive series of 42 patients examined and treated in a uniform manner and followed up until their pain subsided or this management mode failed.
An ambulatory referral private practice.
All patients had pain due to herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia and were referred for management of severe pain. None refused.
Topical application of crushed aspirin tablets dissolved in chloroform.
Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire.
All patients reported substantially decreased pain promptly after treatment, with maximum relief at 20 to 30 minutes and lasting 2 to 4 hours. Patients gradually decreased the use of aspirin in chloroform as pain abated.
Topical aspirin dissolved in chloroform is an effective means of reducing pain due to herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in most patients. The locus of pain origin and analgesia induced by topical aspirin is most likely at cutaneous free-nerve ending pain receptors. The mechanism responsible for the analgesic properties of aspirin is probably not the same as that responsible for its anti-inflammatory properties.
Prenatal treatment of virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia in female fetuses via maternal dexamethasone (Dex) therapy (1-1.5 mg/day) from first trimester to birth was associated with excessive weight gain (47-56 pounds at 35-37 weeks gestation), Cushingoid facial features, severe striae resulting in permanent scarring, and hyperglycemic response (8-11.7 nmol/L) to oral glucose administration in all our experience (three cases). Other symptoms included hypertension, gastrointestinal intolerance, or extreme irritability. Previous pregnancies were uncomplicated by these problems. In each case, first or second trimester amniotic fluid 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP, 17-41 nmol/L; normal less than 0.4 nmol/L), androstenedione (22-31 nmol/L, normal less than 5 nmol/L), and testosterone levels (0.54-0.7 nmol/L, normal less than 0.4 nmol/L) during Dex treatment were elevated regardless of the newborn genital outcome. Maternal serum estriol (E3) levels in one mother (normal newborn genitalia) were consistently low (less than 0.2 nmol/L) during the second and third trimester. In two mothers (partially virilized newborn genitalia) initial second trimester E3 levels were unsuppressed (11, 17.4 nmol/L) and suppressed (less than 1.4 nmol/L) following short-term increased dose.
prenatal Dex treatment of virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia at a dose of 1-1.5 mg daily throughout gestation is associated with significant maternal side effects. Parents should be informed of these side effects before initiation of treatment. Careful monitoring for signs of side effects, medical intervention when necessary, and lowering of Dex dose during the second half of gestation would minimize the side effects. Maternal serum E3 levels appear useful for prediction of fetal outcome while amniotic fluid steroid levels may not.
Although sirolimus (SRL) use in renal allograft recipients (RTX) is associated with improved renal function, proteinuria develops in a significant proportion. 48 SRL-treated RTX were evaluated for development of proteinuria and stratified by level of proteinuria after SRL therapy. The Proteinuria Group (n = 25, 52.1%) had new-onset proteinuria or >25% increase in proteinuria following SRL conversion; the Nonproteinuria Group had stable proteinuria <0.5 g/day throughout. There was a higher proportion of male RTX and female donors to male recipients in the Proteinuria Group, (24% vs. 10%, P = 0.008). Calcineurin inhibitor- and statin usage were significantly higher in the Nonproteinuria Group (8% vs. 17%, P = 0.046; 28% vs. 83%, P < 0.001 respectively) whereas biopsy-proven acute rejection was higher in the Proteinuria Group (68% vs. 33%, P = 0.037). SDS-PAGE analysis of urine from 23 RTX in the Proteinuria Group demonstrated glomerular proteinuria in 100% and tubular proteinuria in 87%. While male gender and gender mismatch may impact on glomerular proteinuria through inadequate nephron dose and subsequent hyperfiltration, concurrent cyclosporine use may mitigate the development of proteinuria in SRL-treated patients, through afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Glomerular injury occurring following acute rejection may further contribute to glomerular proteinuria. Statins, through their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, may protect against development of proteinuria.
In a double-blind, crossover study, five white men with mild-to-moderate hypertension received placebo and fixed doses of atenolol, metoprolol, chlorthalidone, verapamil, and the combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone in a quasi-random order. Daily dosages were: atenolol, 100 mg; metoprolol, 200 mg; chlorthalidone, 50 mg; verapamil, 240 mg; and the same doses of atenolol and chlorthalidone in combination. Standard office and daytime ambulatory blood pressures were assessed at the end of each month-long trial. Atenolol, metoprolol, chlorthalidone, and verapamil controlled office blood pressure with similar reductions. Verapamil did not lower ambulatory blood pressure at this dose (which is lower than is now commonly used), but reductions in ambulatory blood pressure were similar for atenolol, metoprolol, and chlorthalidone. The combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone maintained blood pressure control more effectively than the single drug treatments in both office and ambulatory settings, and the combined hypotensive effects were additive. However, reductions in the office due to the combination appeared to overestimate hypotensive effectiveness in the ambulatory setting. This study suggests that the effectiveness of commonly prescribed antihypertensive regimens varies according to setting as well as drug, and that assessment of treatment effectiveness can be improved by automated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
Male Fischer-344 rats aged 3-4 months and 30-32 months were used in this study. Quinidine in vitro reduced accumulation of organic ions, p-ammonium hippurate (PAH) and tetraethyl ammonium (TEA), inhibited oxygen consumption and increased LDH leakage, in renal cortical slices. High concentrations of quinidine (2 and 3 mmol l-1) produced overt toxicity and no age related differences in any of the parameters measured were observed. But at lower concentrations significant age-related differences in kidney susceptibility to quinidine were evident. Administration of 75 mg kg-1 day-1 quinidine for 4 days caused exacerbated renal damage in senescent rats compared to young adults as demonstrated by greater elevation of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, and greater inhibition of TEA uptake in renal cortical slices. These results establish significant age related differences in renal damage due to quinidine.
Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes in cortical motor areas were measured during a movement of the dominant right hand in 15 patients with Parkinson's disease deprived of their usual levodopa treatment, in 11 patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing long-term treatment with levodopa, and in 15 normal volunteers. The supplementary motor areas were significantly activated in the normal subjects and in the patients receiving levodopa but not in the patients deprived of levodopa. The contralateral primary sensory motor area was significantly activated in all three groups. The ipsilateral primary sensory motor cortex was not activated in the normal subjects and the non-treated patients but was in the patients treated with levodopa. It is concluded that the supplementary motor area hypoactivation which is observed in akinetic non-treated patients with Parkinson's disease is not present in patients undergoing long-term treatment with levodopa. This result suggests that (a) levodopa improves the functional activity of supplementary motor areas in Parkinson's disease and (b) there is no pharmacological tolerance to this effect. The ipsilateral primary motor cortex activation observed in the patients treated with levodopa could be related to levodopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements.
Felbamate and selected compounds were evaluated for their ability to protect against N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced convulsions and lethality in mice. Convulsions produced by intracerebroventricular administration of NMDA (0.8 micrograms per mouse) were antagonized by felbamate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, valproate, diazepam, 2-amino-5-phosphonovalergic acid (APV), dextromethorphan and ketamine. NMDA (350 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally) produced 100% lethality in mice. Felbamate, phenytoin, and phenobarbital were ineffective in preventing NMDA-induced lethalities, whereas diazepam, APV, ketamine and dextromethorphan were the most potent compounds in preventing lethalities. Any relationship between the protective effects of felbamate against NMDA-induced seizures and competitive or non-competitive antagonism of NMDA receptor sites, however, cannot be established until further experimentation is carried out.
The iron chelate, ferric nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA), induces acute proximal tubular necrosis as a consequence of lipid peroxidation and oxidative tissue damage. Chronic exposure of FeNTA leads to a high incidence of renal adenocarcinomas in rodents. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that is activated by oxidative stress and electrophiles, and regulates the basal and inducible expression of numerous detoxifying and antioxidant genes. To determine the roles of Nrf2 in regulating renal gene expression and protecting against oxidative stress-induced kidney damage, wild-type and Nrf2-null mice were administered FeNTA. Renal Nrf2 protein translocated to the nucleus at 6h after FeNTA treatment. FeNTA increased mRNA levels of Nrf2 target genes, including NQO1, GCLC, GSTpi1/2, Mrp1, 2, and 4 in kidneys from wild-type mice, but not Nrf2-null mice. Protein expression of NQO1, a prototypical Nrf2 target gene, was increased in wild-type mice, with no change in Nrf2-null mice. FeNTA produced more nephrotoxicity in Nrf2-null mice than wild-type mice as indicated by higher serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, as more urinary NAG, stronger 4-hydroxynonenal protein adduct staining, and more extensive proximal tubule damage. Furthermore, pretreatment with CDDO-Im, a potent small molecule Nrf2 activator, protected mice against FeNTA-induced renal toxicity. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of Nrf2 protects mouse kidneys from FeNTA-induced oxidative stress damage by coordinately up-regulating the expression of cytoprotective genes.
Linezolid is the first drug issued from the oxazolidinones, a novel class of antimicrobial agents with potent activity against gram-positive pathogens. A rabbit endocarditis model was used to compare the in vivo activities of different linezolid regimens mimicking intermittent dosing of 10 mg/kg of body weight every 12 h for 5 days or continuous (constant-rate) infusion of a daily dose of 20 mg/kg (for 5 days) or 40 mg/kg (for 3 and 5 days) and the activities of intermittent dosing and continuous infusion of vancomycin (for 5 days). The in vivo activities of these regimens were tested against three strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A human-like pharmacokinetic simulation was used for linezolid in order to improve the extrapolation of the results to human therapy. All linezolid regimens significantly reduced the numbers of S. aureus cells in aortic valve vegetations compared to the numbers in the control groups. Linezolid intermittent dosing had an in vivo bacteriostatic effect. Switching from intermittent dosing to continuous infusion (at the same dose) led to in vivo bactericidal activity, with a decrease of at least 3 log(10) CFU/g of vegetation compared to the counts for the controls. After 5 days of treatment, continuous infusion of linezolid (corresponding to a daily dose of 40 mg/kg in humans) seemed to be at least as effective as vancomycin against the three strains. No resistant variant was isolated from the vegetations during any of the treatments. These data suggest that continuous infusion of linezolid could be an appropriate alternative to the use of glycopeptides for the treatment of severe methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections.
A 36-year-old female, presenting with jaundice, developed acute liver failure requiring orthotopic liver transplantation. On admission, none of the known causative factors for acute hepatitis, including use of drugs, were found to be present. Several days after hospitalization, the patient admitted taking therapy prescribed by a "non-traditional" physician, that she had been using for several years due to overweight and which had recently been modified with the introduction of pemoline. A considerable body of evidence exists in the medical literature showing that pemoline, which is a central nervous system stimulant, has variable hepatotoxic effects, ranging from a mild transient increase of serum transaminases to liver failure, including some lethal cases.
Male and female, arteriosclerotic and non-arteriosclerotic rats were treated with the anti-lipemic agent, clofibrate, for 8 days and then subjected to an acute myocardial infarction by injecting them with two large doses of isoproterenol spaced 24 hours apart. The animals were killed at sequential time intervals during the acute necrosis and early repair phases of myocardial infarction. Pre-treatment with clofibrate caused a definite improvement in survival, less shock and prostration, and ECG evidence of little or no ischemia. Increased SGOT levels, hepatic lipid and necrosis were indicative of advanced liver damage. Although clofibrate-treated animals showed little change in serum lipids during the acute cardiac necrosis phase, they were hyperglycemic and showed the greatest increase in BUN levels. Clofibrate-treated animals had higher serum corticosterone levels than those given isoproterenol alone. Despite superior survival rates, both the arteriosclerotic and non-arteriosclerotic, clofibrate-treated animals exhibited equally severe histopathologic evidence of myocardial damage. It is suggested that the protective effect of prophylactic treatment with clofibrate against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats may be due to its ability to change corticosterone levels in the circulation.
