Cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications arising as a result of 1-16-year estrogen therapy were evaluated in 105 prostatic cancer patients. The incidence of the complications was higher in those who had pretreatment cardiological or vascular load. The latter caused death in half of the patients. Preventive and therapeutic measures to control the complications, prognosis signs are indicated.
Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown etiology. Although HHV-8 (human herpesvirus type 8) has been suggested as a possible etiologic agent in a subpopulation of cases, appropriate treatment of the HHV-8 infection has not produced regression of the disease. Additionally, other treatment modalities, including steroids and various regimens of chemotherapy, do not consistently provide good control of the disease. Clinical signs and symptoms of the disease are primarily mediated by cytokines, especially interleukin-6 (IL-6). We report a case of multicentric Castleman's disease that responded dramatically to single agent thalidomide. A powerful cytokine disruptor, thalidomide may have good therapeutic efficacy in treating MCD and related cytokine-mediated disorders.
The records of 239 immunosuppressed patients receiving amphotericin B for suspected or proven aspergillosis were reviewed to determine rates of nephrotoxicity, dialysis, and fatality. The mean and median durations of treatment were 20.4 and 15.0 days, respectively. The creatinine level doubled in 53% of patients and exceeded 2.5 mg/dL in 29%; 14.5% underwent dialysis; and 60% died. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that patients whose creatinine level exceeded 2.5 mg/dL (hazard ratio [HR], 42.02; P<.001), allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients (HR, 6.34; P<. 001), and autologous BMT patients (HR, 5.06; P=.024) were at greatest risk for requiring hemodialysis. Use of hemodialysis (HR, 3. 089; P<.001), duration of amphotericin B use (HR, 1.03 per day; P=. 015), and use of nephrotoxic agents (HR, 1.96; P=.017) were associated with greater risk of death, whereas patients undergoing solid organ transplantation were at lowest risk (HR, 0.46; P=.002). These data indicate that elevated creatinine levels during amphotericin B treatment are associated with a substantial risk for hemodialysis and a higher mortality rate, but the risks vary in different patient groups.
Learned associations between effects of abused drugs and the drug administration environment are important in drug addiction. Histochemical and electrophysiological studies suggest that these associations are encoded in sparsely distributed nucleus accumbens neurons that are selectively activated by drugs and drug-associated cues. Although correlations have been observed between nucleus accumbens neuronal activity and responsivity to drugs and drug cues, no technique exists for selectively manipulating these activated neurons and establishing their causal role in behavioral effects of drugs and drug cues. Here we describe a new approach, which we term the 'Daun02 inactivation method', that selectively inactivates a minority of neurons previously activated by cocaine in an environment repeatedly paired with cocaine to demonstrate a causal role for these activated neurons in context-specific cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization in rats. This method provides a new tool for studying the causal roles of selectively activated neurons in behavioral effects of drugs and drug cues and in other learned behaviors.
(1) In the present study we have attempted to identify changes in gene expression which are associated with neuropathic pain using subtractive suppression hybridization analysis of the lumbar spinal cord of animals suffering streptozocin induced diabetic neuropathy. (2) Using this approach, we found a significant up-regulation of several key components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. These findings were confirmed by Western blot analysis, which demonstrated that the levels of active ERK1 and 2 correlated with the onset of streptozocin-induced hyperalgesia. (3) Intrathecal administration of the selective MAPK/ERK-kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 198306 dose-dependently (1-30 micro g) blocked static allodynia in both the streptozocin and the chronic constriction injury (CCI) models of neuropathic pain. (4) The antihyperalgesic effects of PD 198306, in both the streptozocin and CCI models of neuropathic pain, correlated with a reduction in the elevated levels of active ERK1 and 2 in lumbar spinal cord. (5) Intraplantar administration of PD 198306 had no effect in either model of hyperalgesia, indicating that changes in the activation of ERKs and the effect of MEK inhibition are localized to the central nervous system. (6) In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that the development of neuropathic pain is associated with an increase in the activity of the MAPK/ERK-kinase cascade within the spinal cord and that enzymes in this pathway represent potential targets for the treatment of this condition.
A complex of investigation was performed in 30 males with newly diagnosed prostatic cancer (stages T2NOMO-T3NO-1MO) before treatment with estrogens, 2-3 months and 1 year after its start. The complex included evaluation of blood lipid spectrum (HDL, LDL, VLDL, triglycerides), hemostasis (coagulation, platelet aggregation, fibrinolysis), hormonal profile (blood hydrocortisone, aldosterone, testosterone, estradiol, STH, FSH, LH, prolactin, plasma renin activity), central and intracardiac hemodynamics, ECG. 66 healthy men of advanced age served control. It was found that estrogen therapy affected blood lipid metabolism, leading to impairment of physiological correlation between HDL and triglycerides, increased blood levels of VLDL and triglycerides. Long-term estrogen treatment brought about enhancement of hemocoagulation and platelet aggregation. Hormonal shifts involved hyperprolactinemia, hypersomatotropism, hypercorticism, aldosterone hypersecretion, proportional androgens-estrogens alterations. Hormonal abnormalities produce side effects in estrogen-treated CHD and hypertonic patients: negative ECG readings indicative of deteriorated coronary circulation and hypertensive episodes, central hemodynamic disorders, respectively. In view of possible cardiovascular damage related to estrogen therapy, a differentiated approach is proposed which would allow a long-term estrogen treatment free of relevant complications.
Large doses of cyclophosphamide caused a hemorrhagic diathesis related to bone marrow destruction and thrombocytopenia. Although several organs had hemorrhages, there was a striking predilection for the hypothalamus, ileum and mesentery of adult rats. The reasons for this localization are not known, but involvement of hypothalamus may be related to known functional effects of the drug on the neuroendocrine system. There were hemorrhages in choroid plexus, ciliary body and urinary bladder also, but these localizations were due to prior direct toxic injury to these structures by cyclophosphamide.
The appearance of nephrotic syndromes such as proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia and increase in blood nitrogen urea, induced in rats by injection of puromycin aminonucleoside was markedly inhibited by oral administration of Dup 753 (losartan), a novel angiotensin II receptor antagonist, at a dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg per day. The results suggest a possible involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis.
To determine the effect of amifostine on the safety and efficacy of induction chemotherapy with high-dose cisplatin and vinblastine followed by large-field thoracic irradiation to 60 Gy in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Twenty-six patients with unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC were entered onto the study between May 1991 and November 1994. Patients received amifostine (740 or 910 mg/m2) followed by cisplatin (120 mg/m2) on days 1 and 29. Vinblastine (5 mg/m2) was given weekly for 5 weeks with no amifostine pretreatment. Following chemotherapy, patients received amifostine (340 mg/m2 4 days a week for 5 weeks, or 200 mg/m2 5 days a week for 6 weeks) 15 minutes before definitive thoracic radiation therapy to a total dose of 60 Gy in 6 weeks.
Twenty-five patients were assessable for response and survival. The objective response rate was 60%. One-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 55%, 23%, and 23%. There was no grade 3 or greater renal toxicity during chemotherapy or grade 3 or greater esophagitis during radiation therapy. Neutropenia (secondary to vinblastine use) was the only grade 4 toxicity. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Amifostine can be administered safely with high-dose cisplatin, vinblastine, and radiation therapy for NSCLC. The response rate and survival data provide no evidence that amifostine impairs response to treatment. Amifostine appears to reduce cisplatin-related nephrotoxicity and radiation-induced esophagitis.
The present study was designed to clarify the effects of (-)-ethyl N-[3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxy-4-[2-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)ethoxy]benzoyl]-l-phenylalaninate dihydrochloride (JTE-607), a novel multiple cytokine inhibitor, on hydrochloric acid (HCl) aspiration lung injury in rats. HCl (0.1 N, 2 ml kg(-1)) was instilled into male Sprague-Dawley rats that were pretreated with or without JTE-607 (30 or 75 mg kg(-1) h(-1)). As a control, normal saline (2 ml kg(-1)) was instilled in rats. All the animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneally injected pentobarbital sodium (40 mg kg(-1)). Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 5 h (h) after HCl or normal saline instillation. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the increases in total nuclear cell counts, neutrophil counts, optical density at 412 nm as an indication of pulmonary hemorrhage, concentrations of albumin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant induced by HCl instillation were significantly reduced by JTE-607 pretreatment. The level of expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 mRNA in lung tissue was analyzed. The mean expression level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 mRNA in the JTE-607 group was lower than that in the HCl and NS groups. The wet-to-dry weight ratio was also determined, and JTE-607 at the dose of 75 mg kg(-1) h(-1) significantly attenuated the increased wet-to-dry weight ratio induced by HCl. These results suggest that JTE-607 can inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant and attenuate acid-induced lung injury in rats. This agent might be therapeutically useful for lung injury.
L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is one of the most important drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although neurotoxicity of L-DOPA remains controversial, there are many reports suggesting that L-DOPA causes neuronal death. We investigated whether the neurotoxic effect of L-DOPA could be inhibited by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Cell counting kit-8, trypan blue staining, and DAPI staining all showed that L-DOPA decreased nPC12 cell viability at high concentrations. However, combined treatment with the PI3K activator and L-DOPA significantly increased the viability of nPC12 cells when compared with treatment with L-DOPA only. Phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) (Ser9), and heat shock transcription factor-1, which are survival-related signaling proteins, were decreased in nPC12 cells treated with 200 microM L-DOPA, but were significantly increased with combined treatment with the PI3K activator in a concentration-dependent manner. However, treatment of L-DOPA significantly increased expressions of cytosolic cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3, which are death-related signaling proteins, in nPC12 cells, but combined treatment with the PI3K activator reduced those expressions. To confirm whether the effect of the PI3K activator is associated with direct activation of PI3K, LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, was used to pretreat the nPC12 cells prior to combined treatment with the PI3K activator and L-DOPA. The protective effect of the PI3K activator was almost completely blocked. Together, these results suggest that L-DOPA neurotoxicity can be prevented by PI3K activation.
Analyses of the risks of stroke were conducted for subjects with and without diabetes, participating in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a perindopril-based blood pressure lowering regimen in 6105 people with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), followed for a median of 3.9 years.
Seven hundred and sixty-one patients had diabetes at baseline. Diabetes increased the risk of recurrent stroke by 35% (95% CI 10-65%) principally through an effect on ischaemic stroke (1.53, 95% CI 1.23-1.90). Active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9.5/4.6 mmHg in patients with diabetes and by 8.9/3.9 mmHg in patients without diabetes. The proportional risk reductions achieved for stroke in patients with diabetes, 38% (95% CI 8-58%), and patients without diabetes, 28% (95% CI 16-39%), were not significantly different (p homogeneity = 0.5). The absolute reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke in the patients with diabetes was equivalent to one stroke avoided among every 16 (95% CI 9-111) patients treated for 5 years.
Diabetes is an important risk factor for stroke in patients with established cerebrovascular disease. Treatment with the ACE inhibitor perindopril with discretionary use of the diuretic indapamide produced reductions in the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with diabetes that were at least as great as those achieved in patients without diabetes.
Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol) is the most widely used antipyretic and analgesic in the United States. Acetaminophen, a combination agent in approximately 125 medications, has been deemed safe and effective when used within the recommended dosage. In 1998 and 1999, however, 203,930 cases of acetaminophen overingestion were reported to U.S. poison centers, making it the leading pharmacologic agent associated with toxicity.
Several studies have documented the involvement of oxidative stress represented by lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To test whether the highly reactive carbonyl crotonaldehyde (CRA), generated during lipid peroxidation, is involved in AD, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis in AD and age-matched control hippocampi using a specific antibody against protein-bound CRA (P-CRA). In the AD cases, P-CRA immunoreactivity was preferentially localized in reactive astrocytes and microglia around senile plaques (SPs) and those present in the neuropil, while it was weakly detectable in neurons and neurofibrillary tangles. P-CRA immunoreactivity was also localized in all portions of diffuse SPs and the dystrophic neurites of neuritic and classical SPs, but was undetectable in amyloid cores. Age-matched controls showed P-CRA immunoreactivity only very weakly in neurons. In contrast to P-CRA, immunoreactivities for protein-bound acrolein and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal were mainly localized to neurons and rarely seen in glial cells. Our results suggest that increased oxidative stress and CRA formation in glial cells is implicated in the disease processes of AD.
Calcium valproate is an anticonvulsant agent with pharmacokinetic properties similar to sodium valproate and valproic acid. Potential carcinogenesis of calcium valproate was evaluated in B6C3F1 mice and Wistar rats given 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg in the diet for 104 weeks. Survival in treated rats increased in a dose-related pattern despite a tumorigenic response in females. Adenocarcinomas of the uterus and cervix were increased in treated rats when compared to controls. The incidence of uterine neoplasia was 8, 20, 14 and 32% in the control, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg groups, respectively. Neoplasia in treated rats were detected against a higher than expected background of adenocarcinomas in concurrent controls, since 8% incidence in controls was substantially above the laboratory historical database value of 0.6%. Tumors varied from epithelial masses confined to the endometrium, to transmural, highly desmoplastic neoplasms that invaded the serosa lining and the peritoneal cavity. These tumors metastasized in treated rats but not in controls. The statistically significant (P less than 0.01) increase in uterine adenocarcinomas found in females given 500 mg/kg of calcium valproate contrasts the absence of this tumor type in a previous rat carcinogenicity bioassay with valproic acid. Subcutaneous fibrosarcomas were significantly increased in valproic acid-treated males, but no uterine tumors were reported in females. It is puzzling that a true carcinogenic potential would be expressed by markedly different target organs as obtained with the acid and calcium salt of this moiety.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of octreotide treatment on hepatic heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, together with the influence of altered hepatic HO-1 expression levels on hepatic function and fibrosis in bile duct-ligated rats. The rats were divided randomly into sham, cirrhotic, cobalt protoporphyrin and octreotide treatment groups. The expression levels of hepatic HO-1 mRNA were measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, while the protein expression was determined by western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. Hematoxylin and eosin, and Van Gieson's staining, along with determination of the hydroxyproline content in the liver, were performed to determine the degree of liver fibrosis. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in arterial blood, and the mean arterial pressure and portal vein pressure were also measured. As compared with the sham group, hepatic HO-1 mRNA and protein expression levels, serum levels of ALT, AST and TBIL, COHb in arterial blood, hydroxyproline and collagen type I content were all significantly increased in the cirrhotic group. As compared with the cirrhotic group, the octreotide-treated group exhibited significantly reduced hepatic HO-1 expression levels, serum levels of ALT, AST and TBIL, COHb in arterial blood and the extent of hepatic fibrosis, whereas the cobalt protoporphyrin group exhibited significantly increased hepatic HO-1 expression levels, as well as aggravated hepatic function and fibrosis (P<0.05). In conclusion, octreotide inhibited hepatic HO-1 overexpression in cirrhotic rats, reduced hepatic HO-1 expression levels to relieve liver injury and attenuated liver fibrosis.
In this study, we investigated the interaction between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lead (Pb) and the involvement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and oxidative stress in Pb-plus-LPS (Pb/LPS)-induced liver damage in rats. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TNF-alpha, nitric oxide (NO), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were determined in rats treated with Pb and/or LPS. Pb ranging from 0 to 15 mg/kg dose dependently increased AST, ALT, NO, or LPO in LPS-treated rats. Pretreatment with iNOS inhibitor 1400W reduced NO, LPO, TNF-alpha, AST, and ALT in Pb/LPS-treated rats. Thus, Pb increased LPS-induced liver damage, which might be associated with increased NO-initiated oxidative stress and TNF-alpha in rats.
In most developed countries of the world the basis of the ulcer treatment is formed by H+/K(+)-ATPase blockers: omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole etc. though in accordance with the Maastricht treaty (2) the first line therapy may also be based upon the application of one of H2-histamine receptor blockers, specifically the two-component ranitidine bismuth citrate preparation.
Radiocontrast agents are one of the most common causes of acute renal failure in the world. These agents are required for both diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of medical intervention, including computed tomography (CT), angiography and cardiac catheterization. Publications over the past 40 years support three potential mechanisms of toxicity: oxidative stress, haemodynamics and hyperosmolar effects. An in vitro model provides a rapid evaluation of cellular toxicity without the complications of haemodynamics. This study evaluated the renal toxicity of radiocontrast agents at clinically relevant concentrations.
This study investigated the toxicity of two radiocontrast agents, diatrizoic acid (DA) and iothalamic acid (IA), using an in vitro model. Renal cortical slices isolated from F344 rats were incubated with 0-111 mg I/ml DA or IA.
Renal slices exposed to DA and IA showed toxicity as measured by increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage at concentrations lower than previously published using isolated cell models. These data indicate that DA and IA are toxic to renal cortical slices, and this is a more sensitive model than previously used cell culture systems. DA and IA treatment failed to cause a significant decrease in total cellular glutathione or increase in percent glutathione disulphide (GSSG), implying that oxidative stress may not be an initial mechanism of toxicity. Finally, the addition of exogenous glutathione did provide complete protection from DA- and IA-induced LDH leakage.
These data validate the renal cortical slice in vitro model for investigation of radiocontrast nephrotoxicity. These studies further showed that glutathione was cytoprotective. Future research using this model is aimed at further characterization of radiocontrast nephrotoxicity, which may allow for improved prevention and treatment of radiocontrast-induced acute renal failure.
