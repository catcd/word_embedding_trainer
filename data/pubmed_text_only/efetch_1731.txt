1. Many experimental and clinical arthritides are characterized by their bilateral nature. There is strong evidence to suggest that this bilateral spread may be mediated by a neuronal mechanism. We have previously shown early and sustained induction of mRNAs encoding preprotachykinin (PPT) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating an inflamed, arthritic joint. We have now investigated the involvement of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents and the expression of neuropeptide mRNAs in the maintenance and bilateral spread of mild adjuvant-induced arthritis in the rat. 2. Capsaicin was applied perineurally to either the left (Cap-L) or right (Cap-R) sciatic nerve of halothane-anaesthetized male Han Wistar rats. Two weeks after capsaicin lesioning, arthritis was induced by injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) around the left ankle at a dose that caused inflammation of the left ankle joint, and a delayed (14 days) contralateral (right) ankle arthritis. Arthritis was monitored for 15 days after injection, when animals were killed and the lumbar DRG dissected. PPT, CGRP, somatostatin (SS), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) mRNA expression was determined in L5 DRG using in situ hybridization. 3. Spread of inflammation/arthritis to the right limb was associated with bilateral rises in PPT and CGRP mRNA expression in L5 DRG. SS mRNA expression in right DRG was unaffected by spread of inflammation. FCA-L+Cap-L reduced left joint swelling and prevented spread of arthritis to the right joint when assessed by joint swelling. This inhibition of spread of arthritis was associated with significant reductions in all left L5 DRG neuropeptide mRNAs compared with controls, and the rise in right L5 DRG PPT mRNA expression seen in FCA-L-alone animals was blocked. FCA-L+Cap-R also reduced left joint swelling and prevented the spread of inflammation to the right ankle. This lesion prevented the rise in PPT and CGRP mRNA expression seen in right DRG with FCA-L alone. 4. These findings suggest a role for capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents and the primary afferent neuropeptides encoded by PPT and CGRP mRNA in the maintenance and spread of arthritis.
To compare the quality of anesthesia with propofol, ketamine, or etomidate in children undergoing brief diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.
Retrospective study.
University hospital.
971 pediatric oncology patients undergoing brief diagnostic or therapeutic procedures outside the operating room during a one-year period.
Total intravenous anesthesia was administered primarily with ketamine, etomidate, or propofol for oncology-related procedures such as bone marrow aspiration, lumbar puncture, radiologic imaging, and radiation therapy. Quality assurance data were collected for all patients, including anesthetic technique, dosage, and the occurrence of specific adverse events during anesthesia and recovery periods.
There were 279 anesthesia-related occurrences, comprised almost entirely of five specific events: vomiting, hypoxemia (SpO2 less than 94%), tachycardia, agitation, and myoclonus. Ketamine was associated with vomiting (14.6%), agitation (15.0%), and tachycardia (19.5%). Etomidate was also associated with vomiting (9.9%) and agitation (1.2%). Hypoxemia was rare except in the propofol group (15.7%) and was easily managed with supplemental oxygen, but occasionally required manually assisted ventilation via face mask. In patients receiving propofol vomiting (0.5%) and agitation (1.2%) were rare.
Anesthesia with propofol, ketamine, or etomidate is safe and efficacious for children undergoing brief procedures. Propofol is associated with a decreased incidence of postanesthetic agitation and vomiting. Its association with respiratory depression is confirmed.
Vascular tissues express heme oxygenase (HO), which metabolizes heme to form carbon monoxide (CO). CO relaxes vascular smooth muscle but inhibits nitric oxide (NO) formation. Decreased NO synthesis may contribute to salt-induced hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats. The current study examines the hypothesis that elevated levels of endogenous CO contribute to NO dysfunction in salt-induced hypertensive DS rats. Male DS rats were placed on high-salt (8% NaCl, HS) or low-salt (0.3% NaCl, LS) diets for 4 weeks. With respect to the LS group, the HS group's blood pressure and carboxyhemoglobin levels were elevated, and abdominal aortas showed 6-fold higher HO-1 protein levels. Experiments used isolated pressurized first-order gracilis muscle arterioles superfused with oxygenated modified Krebs buffer. An inhibitor of NO synthase, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), caused concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in both groups, with attenuated responses in HS arterioles. HS arterioles also showed attenuated vasodilatory responses to an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine. Acute pretreatment with an inhibitor of HO, chromium mesoporphyrin, enhanced vascular responses to L-NAME and acetylcholine in both groups but abolished the differences between HS and LS arterioles. These data show that HO-1 protein levels and CO production are increased in HS rats. Arteriolar responses to L-NAME and acetylcholine are impaired in HS rats compared with LS animals, and this difference can be abolished by an inhibitor of endogenous CO production. These results suggest that elevated levels of endogenous CO contribute to arteriolar NO dysfunction in DS rats with salt-induced hypertension.
To test the hypothesis that ibuprofen increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, or anaphylaxis among febrile children.
Randomized double-blind acetaminophen-controlled trial.
Outpatient pediatric and family medicine practices.
A total of 84,192 children.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive 12 mg/kg of acetaminophen, 5 mg/kg of ibuprofen, or 10 mg/kg of ibuprofen.
Hospitalizations for acute gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, and anaphylaxis.
A total of 277 patients (0.3%) were unavailable for follow-up. Overall, 795 participants (1%) were hospitalized, primarily for infectious diseases; hospitalization rates did not differ according to treatment group. Four children had diagnoses of acute, nonmajor gastrointestinal bleeding (two in each ibuprofen dosage group); among ibuprofen-treated children, the observed risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, 7.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval, 2 to 18 per 100,000), was not significantly different from the risk among acetaminophen-treated children (P = .31). There were no hospitalizations for acute renal failure or anaphylaxis; the upper 95% confidence bound for the risk of either of these outcomes was 5.4 per 100,000 ibuprofen-treated children. Among a number of other possibly serious adverse drug events, low white blood cell count was marginally associated with ibuprofen treatment. Because this association was observed in the setting of multiple comparisons and white blood cell counts may have been low before treatment, causation is unclear.
The risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, or anaphylaxis was not increased following short-term use of ibuprofen in children. These data, however, provide no information on the risks of less severe outcomes or the risks of prolonged ibuprofen use.
Nicotinic acid (niacin) has long been used as an antidyslipidemic drug. Its special profile of actions, especially the rise in HDL-cholesterol levels induced by nicotinic acid, is unique among the currently available pharmacological tools to treat lipid disorders. Recently, a G-protein-coupled receptor, termed GPR109A (HM74A in humans, PUMA-G in mice), was described and shown to mediate the nicotinic acid-induced antilipolytic effects in adipocytes. One of the major problems of the pharmacotherapeutical use of nicotinic acid is a strong flushing response. This side effect, although harmless, strongly affects patient compliance. In the present study, we show that mice lacking PUMA-G did not show nicotinic acid-induced flushing. In addition, flushing in response to nicotinic acid was also abrogated in the absence of cyclooxygenase type 1, and mice lacking prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) receptors had reduced flushing responses. The mouse orthologue of GPR109A, PUMA-G, is highly expressed in macrophages and other immune cells, and transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into irradiated PUMA-G-deficient mice restored the nicotinic acid-induced flushing response. Our data clearly indicate that GPR109A mediates nicotinic acid-induced flushing and that this effect involves release of PGE(2) and PGD(2), most likely from immune cells of the skin.
The effect of motorcycle exhaust (ME) on the motor nerve was studied using animals exposed to the exhaust by inhalation, intratracheal, or intraperitoneal administration of ME particulate (MEP). A 4-wk ME inhalation and intratracheal instillation of MEP for 1 d in rats or intraperitoneal administration of MEP (0.5 g/kg/d for 1 d and 0.1 g/kg/d for 2 d) in mice significantly decreased both rota-rod performance and motor nerve conduction velocity. The effect of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on the motor nerve was also investigated. Treatment with benzo[a]pyrene (0.05 and 0.1 g/kg/d for 3 d), but not pyrene (0.1 g/kg/d for 3 d), resulted in significant decrease of motor nerve conduction velocity in mice. Moreover, the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activities of sciatic nerves isolated from ME-, MEP-, or benzo[a]pyrene-exposed animals were decreased. Treatment with pyrene did not markedly affect the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity of sciatic nerve. The rats exposed to ME for 4 wk showed increases in blood and sciatic nerve manganese levels. Results indicate that motorcycle exhaust produces adverse effects on the motor nerve, which is associated with a fall in nerve Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity.
To observe the effect of fluoroacetamide on cardiomyocytes of rat and the antidotal effect of acetamide.
4 groups of SD rats were treated with various dosages of fluoroacetamid(p.o.) and 2 groups of them were treated with acetamide(i.p.). The changes of cardiomyocytes and serum AST, LDH, CK, CK-MB and HBDH were measured at different intervals after poisoning.
In the group treated with fluoroacetamid 8 mg/kg. bw, serum AST[(589.58 +/- 821.72) U/L], CK[(916.78 +/- 343.55) U/L], HBDH[(504.47 +/- 148.88) U/L] raised obviously compared with control[(187.70 +/- 46.87), (755.65 +/- 498.90), (347.25 +/- 228.40) U/L respectively] (P < 0.01), and the pathological findings such as degeneration, liquefactive necrosis and filtration of inflammatory cells in cardiac muscles were observed 24 hours later, while all the male dead within 3 days. In the group treated with fluoroacetamid 4 mg/kg. bw, serum LDH and HBDH rose significantly compared with control(P < 0.01) 5 day later. On the day of 10, myocardial enzymes restored in all experiment groups with some interstitial fibroblastic proliferation. The pathological changes were reduced in the group treated with acetamide synchronously (100 mg/kg. bw).
Acute intoxication of fluoroacetamide could damage cardiomyocytes while acetamide could reduce the injury of them, but the injury was reversible. The levels of serum myocardial enzymes could be a usable index for early diagnosis.
Isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO), a beta adrenergic agonist, is known to cause ischemic necrosis in rats. Cardiotoxicity of three different doses of ISO were studied using physiological, biochemical and histopathological parameters. The effects of single and double dose of ISO were analysed, which illustrated that single ISO dose was more cardiotoxic than double ISO dose due to ischemic preconditioning. The tetrapeptide derivatives L-lysine-L-arginine-L-aspartic acid-L-serine (tetrapeptide A) and di-tert.butyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine-L-arginine-L-aspartic acid-tert.butyl O-tert.butyl-L-serinate (tetrapeptide B) along with acetylsalicylic acid as positive control were analysed at different time points for their cardioprotective effect. The results demonstrated that optimal protective effects were observed by pretreatment with 5 mg/kg of tetrapeptide B and this was found to be slightly better than that of acetylsalicylic acid. A lesser degree of cardioprotection was noticed when low doses of tetrapeptide B were administered. This study clearly showed that single dose of ISO (50 mg/kg, s.c.) induced myocardial necrosis could be used as a model to assess cardiovascular drugs and in this model, it was demonstrated that the tetrapeptide B could exhibit optimal cardioprotective effect.
Invasion, either directly or via metastasis formation, is the main cause of death in cancer patients. Development of efficient anti-invasive agents is an important research challenge. 6,6'-bis (2,3-dimethoxybenzoyl)-a, a-d-trehalose (DMBT), one of brartemicin analogs, was found to be the most potent anti-invasive agent, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Our current study was to explore the effects of DMBT on invasion and metastasis in B16BL6 cells. Antiproliferation assay and trypan blue exclusion assay showed that no obvious inhibitory or cytotoxic effect of DMBT was found in B16BL6 cells. Wound healing demonstrated that DMBT could inhibit cell migration compared with the normal group. Transwell experiments showed that DMBT could significantly inhibit invasion to the reconstituted basement membrane (P<0.01). We examined the effects of lung metastasis produced by highly metastatic B16BL6 melanoma cells by using experimental metastasis models and BLI analysis. DMBT could significantly suppress lung metastasis in mice. Results from immunohistochemical staining, Western blotting and real-time PCR indicated that the chemopreventive effect of DMBT was attributed to the inhibition of the VEGF and MMP-9 through Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. These results suggested that DMBT could be a promising lead molecule for the anti-metastasis and serve as a therapeutic agent to inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
We designed, synthesized, and evaluated haloacetylcarbamoyl-2-nitroimidazoles, including chloro (KIN-1800, TX-1835, and TX-1836) and bromo derivatives (TX-1844, TX-1845, and TX-1846), as potential hypoxic cell radiosensitizers with antiangiogenic activities. To establish biological function owing to the haloacetylcarbamoyl group in the side-chain, we compared their in vitro radiosensitizing activities with those of their parent 2-nitroimidazoles without haloacetylcarbamoyl groups: misonidazole (MISO), TX-1831, and TX-1832, respectively. Both tert-butoxy substituted derivatives. TX-1835 and TX-1845, were more potent radiosensitizers than TX-1831. The p-tert-butylphenoxy-substituted derivatives, TX-1836 and TX-1846, and the methoxysubstituted derivatives, KIN-1800 and TX-1844, were stronger radiosensitizers than TX-1832 and MISO. We examined the anti-angiogenic activities of these 2-nitroimidazole derivatives containing haloacetylcarbamoyl group by the rat lung endothelial (RLE) cell proliferation assay and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (chick CAM) angiogenesis assay and showed that haloacetylcarbamoyl-2-nitroimidazoles were more potent angiogenic inhibitors than the corresponding desacetylcarbamoyl-2-nitroimidazoles. The in vivo chick CAM angiogenesis assay showed that the strong bromoacetylcarbamoyl-2-nitroimidazole radiosensitizers, such as TX-1845 and TX-1846, were the strongest angiogenic inhibitors among them. We concluded that the bromoacetylcarbamoyl-2-nitroimidazole radiosensitizers, such as TX-1845 and TX-1846, are promising as anti-angiogenic hypoxic cell radiosensitizers.
Livedoid vasculopathy (LV) is a chronic idiopathic disease characterized by painful purpuric macules on lower extremities. Its exact aetiology remains uncertain, but thrombotic and microcirculatory phenomena have been implicated as possible pathogenic factors.
To assess prospectively the frequency of thrombophilia and to verify the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy among LV patients.
Thirty-four LV patients were tested for prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, antithrombin activity, protein C and S activity, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, prothrombin gene mutation, factor V Leiden mutation, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation, plasma homocysteine and fibrinogen. Thirteen of these patients were treated with anticoagulant drugs (either warfarin or heparin).
Of 34 patients, 18 (52%) presented laboratory abnormalities of procoagulant conditions. Positive treatment response to anticoagulant therapy was observed in 11 patients. Improvement of pain was obtained in 1-3 weeks, an average of 1.8 week. Complete healing of the lesions was observed in about 2.3 months. Remission was sustained even after treatment interruption and lasted an average 7.8 months. No severe adverse effects were noticed.
The authors suggest all patients with diagnosis of LV to be investigated for thrombophilic status. Anticoagulant drugs were well tolerated and seemed to be effective in treating not only LV symptoms but also its ulcerations.
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is involved in neutrophil transmigration across endothelium during sepsis-induced acute lung injury and anti-ICAM-1 interventions may represent new strategy of pulmonary protection. Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory actions via decrease of expression of adhesion molecules. We investigated the role of HO-1 in the action of curcumin, a naturally occurring yellow pigment isolated from plant Curcuma longa L., on ICAM-1 expression in tumour necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated EA.hy926 cells and lungs of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. Both, in vitro and in vivo curcumin induced HO-1 and curcumin-elicited induction of HO-1 was associated with inhibition ICAM-1 expression. Moreover, curcumin significantly inhibited pulmonary sequestration of leucocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide as evidenced by decrease of myeloperoxidase activity in lung tissue. Both in vitro and in vivo effects of curcumin were reversed by an inhibitor of HO activity, chromium (III) mesoporphyrin IX chloride. We conclude that induction of HO-1, via decrease of endothelial ICAM-1, plays a pivotal role in curcumin-dependent prevention of pulmonary sequestration of neutrophils in a mouse model of endotoxaemia.
Massive hepatic necrosis following exposure to phenytoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a rare occurrence and to the best of our knowledge has not been reported previously. Acute hepatic failure following administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has rarely been seen, and only 4 cases have been well documented pathologically. We report a case of acute liver failure in a 60-year-old woman following ingestion of phenytoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concomitantly over a 9-day period. Autopsy findings revealed acute fulminant hepatic failure. This case demonstrates the effects of chemical-chemical interactions in the potentiation of hepatotoxicity of single agents and specifically illustrates the need for discontinuing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the presence of early liver injury.
In industrialized countries there is a high prevalence of allergy toward nickel ions. The exposure of affected individuals to nickel leads to a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which is induced by antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Beside this antigenic potential, immunomodulatory properties of nickel ions were described. To dissect the role of both mechanisms for HIV replication, we studied HIV expansion in PBMC of nickel-allergic and nonallergic donors. Nickel ions promote HIV replication in PBMC as efficiently as protein antigens. The nickel-mediated virus expansion strictly required the presence of nickel-specific T cells. Data obtained with nickel-specific CD4 T cell clones showed that antigen-mediated proliferation is an absolute prerequisite for HIV expansion. However, the previously suggested immunomodulatory properties of nickel ions do not seem to contribute to HIV expansion. As a widely distributed antigen with increasing numbers of allergic people, nickel may be an important and underestimated factor of HIV expansion in vivo.
This is a randomized single blind parallel comparison of alclometasone dipropionate cream 0.1% vs hydrocortisone butyrrate in 39 geriatric patients (greater than 60 years old) with steroid sensible skin diseases. The regimen consisted of dosing patients with two applications of the two drugs every day for 4 weeks. Follow-up evaluations have been done weekly, and subjective and objective clinical symptoms, adherence to the study protocol, evolution of the disease, onset of adverse reactions including atrophy have been recorded. Furthermore possible side-effects on hypophysis-adrenal axis have been monitored in baseline conditions, after 7 days and at the end of therapy. In most patients bioptic skin patterns for histomorphometric examination have been drawn before and after therapy to be evaluated by a blind examinator. Alclometasone has reduced initial skin lesions by 82.2%, the extent as hydrocortisone butyrrate. In five patients the complete clearance of the disease has been obtained. Study drugs have been tolerated well by all patients, nor clinical signs of atrophy have been observed. Fluctuations of blood cortisol levels ranged between the normal values. In patients treated with alclometasone histomorphometry revealed a better skin trophism than in patients treated with hydrocortisone butyrrate.
Systemically administered mexiletine, an antiarrhythmic, has been shown to also possess analgesic properties in some conditions of neuropathic pain. It has been suggested that the analgesic effect of mexiletine may be derived from the action of one of its optical isomers, (+)(S)-mexiletine. In the present study, we have compared the effects of systemic (-)-(R)- and (+)-(S)-mexiletine, on chronic mechanical allodynia-like behaviour in spinally injured rats, a model of central neuropathic pain in which racemic mexiletine has been shown to be active. I.p. racemic mexiletine as well as (-)-(R)- and (+)(S)-mexiletine at 25 mg/kg all produced significant, but brief, alleviation of mechanical allodynia in a similar fashion as assessed with von-Frey hair elicited vocalization in the spinally injured rats. A slight increase in motor impairment was observed in all three groups which reached statistical significance for the racemic mexiletine and (+)-(S)-mexiletine. Our results suggest that both isomers of mexiletine contribute to the antiallodynic effect in this model of central pain.
Two chronically alcohol-addicted patients, a 37-year old woman and a 22-year old man, developed a severe polyneuropathy after being treated with very high doses of disulfiram. In the first case there was a high-grade proximal tetraparesis, especially of the legs; in the other there was a similar largely motor, but predominantly distal, neuropathy. Electrophysiological tests established a pattern of axonal damage. Guillain-Barré syndrome was excluded by analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. Over a period of observation of 6 months and 2 1/2 years, respectively, the paresis continued even after disulfiram had been discontinued. 2 1/2 years later the electrophysiological changes were still present. As disulfiram treatment may cause severe side effects it is recommended that the lowest possible dosage by employed.
At least five arenaviruses cause viral haemorrhagic fevers in humans. Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus, uses the cellular receptor alpha-dystroglycan to infect cells. Machupo, Guanarito, Junin and Sabia viruses are New World haemorrhagic fever viruses that do not use alpha-dystroglycan. Here we show a specific, high-affinity association between transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and the entry glycoprotein (GP) of Machupo virus. Expression of human TfR1, but not human transferrin receptor 2, in hamster cell lines markedly enhanced the infection of viruses pseudotyped with the GP of Machupo, Guanarito and Junin viruses, but not with those of Lassa or lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses. An anti-TfR1 antibody efficiently inhibited the replication of Machupo, Guanarito, Junin and Sabia viruses, but not that of Lassa virus. Iron depletion of culture medium enhanced, and iron supplementation decreased, the efficiency of infection by Junin and Machupo but not Lassa pseudoviruses. These data indicate that TfR1 is a cellular receptor for New World haemorrhagic fever arenaviruses.
The following is a case report of a 1-month-old patient who developed adverse hemodynamic sequelae during the use of nitric oxide (NO) in the postoperative period for pulmonary hypertension after correction of total anomalous pulmonary venous return. At the time of diagnosis, the patient had evidence of systemic right ventricular pressures estimated by continuous-wave Doppler. He was sedated and paralyzed for hyperventilation in preparation for surgery and underwent pulmonary vein confluence to left atrial anastomosis. Postoperative pulmonary hypertension was managed by hyperventilation, sedation, and paralysis until a sudden onset of systemic-level pulmonary pressure required NO therapy. Satisfactory results were obtained in minutes, but a rebound pulmonary hypertension occurred with concomitant systemic hypertension and no radiographic changes. We suspected left atrial hypertension secondary to a sudden increase in pulmonary blood flow to an noncompliant left ventricle. Discontinuation of NO resulted in stabilization of the hemodynamic profile of the patient and he continued to be managed with paralysis, hyperventilation, and sedation. Based on this experience we suggest that NO should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lesions at the atrial level prior to surgery (mitral valve stenosis and cor triatriatum) or in patients with a poorly compliant left ventricle (cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction). These entities are unable to tolerate a sudden increase in pulmonary blood return thus creating paradoxical pulmonary hypertension.
The effects of calcium inhibitors are not limited to the muscles and may affect other systems and cause varied side effects. Two cases of Parkinsonian syndrome occurring after starting therapy with calcium inhibitors (verapamil in one case and diltiazem in the other) are reported. Complete regression of the symptoms after withdrawing the drugs was strongly in favour of a causal relationship. The condition could be due to inhibition of the calcium channels in the central nervous system disturbing neurotransmission. This seems to be a rare side effect as there have only been three other reported cases of secondary extrapyramidal syndromes in the literature. However, a Parkinsonian syndrome is very invalidating and clinicians using this family of drugs should be aware of this possible complication.
CHF3381 is a new low-affinity, noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and reversible monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitor. The analgesic activity of CHF3381 was investigated in the heat-capsaicin human pain model and compared with those of gabapentin. Twenty-seven young, healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of CHF3381 (500 mg), gabapentin (1,200 mg), or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study design. Measurements were done before and 135 to 145 minutes after treatment administration and included area of secondary hyperalgesia around the sensitized skin of the forearm (45 degrees C for 5 minutes followed by topical capsaicin for 30 minutes), area of secondary hyperalgesia after thermal sensitization of the thigh (45 degrees C for 3 minutes), heat pain detection thresholds (degrees C), and pain on a visual analogue scale after long thermal stimulation (45 degrees C for 1 minute). Compared with placebo, both gabapentin and CHF3381 significantly reduced the area of secondary hyperalgesia on the dominant forearm. Median (and interquartile range) percent values over baseline were 86% after placebo (69% to 100%), 56% (41% to 76%) after gabapentin (P < .001), and 67% (49% to 88%) after CHF3381 (P < .009). Both drugs also significantly decreased the area of secondary hyperalgesia on the dominant thigh. The other pain variables were not significantly affected. Adverse events, mainly fatigue and dizziness, were mild to moderate.
This article presents the antihyperalgesic effect of CHF3381, a new NMDA receptor antagonist and reversible MAO-A inhibitor, in a human pain model and might guide the proper selection of CHF3381 doses to be used in Phase 2 studies in patients with neuropathic pain.
Because of discrepancies in the estimates of the relative analgesic potencies of hydromorphone and morphine, the drugs were compared in two four-point, double-blind bioassays. In the first study, hydromorphone, 1 and 2 mg, was compared with morphine, 5 and 10 mg, in 31 postoperative patients; in the second, hydromorphone, 0.5 and 1 mg, was compared with morphine, 5 and 10 mg, in 112 postoperative patients. Subjective responses to nurse-observer questions were used to quantitate analgesia for postoperative pain. Hydromorphone is more potent than commonly believed: approximately 0.9 to 1.2 mg is equianalgesic with 10 mg of morphine, with a similar incidence of side effects.
The effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on spatial cognitive deficits induced in the rat by injections of scopolamine were examined in a radial arm maze. A single intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of VIP inhibited the reduction in the number of initial correct responses in rats with scopolamine-induced amnesia. The inhibition was associated with a bell-shaped dose-response curve. Thus, VIP appears to have an ameliorating effect on spatial cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine in the rat.
