The safety and efficacy of fluoxetine in the short-term treatment of late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD) have been shown in several studies, but its efficacy and safety over more than a few cycles have not been demonstrated.
Sixty-four women with prospectively confirmed LLPDD were treated with fluoxetine for a mean of 18.6 months. Response was determined by clinical interview and Clinical Global Impressions rating within the first three cycles, and subjects were followed clinically every 3 to 6 months. Medication dose was titrated on the basis of side effects and response. Women who had been treated for at least 1 year were asked to discontinue medication to reassess the need for treatment.
Sixty women were able to tolerate at least 1 month of treatment. Of these, 57% (N = 34) remained on 20 mg/day and 37% (N = 22) received 40 mg/day. Fifty-two percent (N = 31) achieved remission (CGI score = 1); 48% (N = 29) achieved a partial remission of symptoms (CGI score = 2). The most common side effect was sexual dysfunction, which occurred in 17% of women (N = 10). Symptoms recurred in most women after treatment discontinuation and remitted again with reinstitution of treatment. An earlier age at onset of LLPDD or a prior episode of major depression was associated with achieving only partial remission of symptoms.
These results support the findings of the double-blind studies of fluoxetine treatment for LLPDD. Fluoxetine is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for this condition when used over time. Approximately half of those treated achieved complete remission of their symptoms, while the others experienced significant improvement. This study also lends further support to the effectiveness of serotonergic agents in the treatment of premenstrual symptoms.
Trimethyltin chloride (TMT), a byproduct of plastic stabilizers, has caused 67 poisoning accidents in the world; more than 98% (1814/1849) of the affected patients since 1998 have been in China. As a long-established toxic chemical, TMT severely affects the limbic system and the cerebellum; however, its relationship with hypokalemia, a condition observed in the majority of the cases in the last decade, remains elusive. To understand the mechanism underlying hypokalemia induced by TMT, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered TMT to determine the relationship between H(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and the blood and urine K(+) concentration and pH, respectively. H(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein and mRNA were observed too. In vitro changes to intracellular pH, K(+) channels in renal cells were measured. The results showed that TMT increased potassium leakage from the kidney, raised urine pH, and inhibited H(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity both in vitro and in vivo. In the tested animals, H(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was positively correlated with the decrease of plasma K(+) and blood pH but was negatively correlated with the increase of urine K(+) and urine pH (P<0.01), while TMT did not change the expression of H(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein and mRNA. TMT decreased intracellular pH and opened K(+) channels in renal intercalated cells. Our findings suggest TMT can directly inhibit the activity of H(+)/K(+)-ATPases in renal intercalated cells, reducing urine K(+) reabsorption and inducing hypokalemia.
We studied the uroprotective effect of mesna, at doses of 40-300 mg/kg/i.p., in single or fractioned injections, on the development of cyclophosphamide (CP, 100 mg/kg/i.p.) cystitis in rats. The study concerns the histological, behavioural and nervous aspects of the disease. The specific effects of mesna, when injected alone, have also been considered. The mesna itself does not have specific deleterious effects, except at a dose of 300 mg/kg which provokes a moderate vesical inflammation although without consequence on the animal's behaviour. Mesna offers good protection against CP cystitis for only certain posologies. The uroprotective effects of mesna reach maxima at doses of 40-100 mg/kg and for fractioned injections given over the entire time frame of the urinary toxic release. The uroprotective effects of other posologies are only partial. The nervous activities were studied through the expression of Fos protein. The repetitive intraperitoneal injection of mesna induced a spinal activity and a preferential contralateral activity of the trigemino/reticular areas of the brainstem spinal cord junction--an effect which was reduced in the presence of CP. The prevention of cystitis by mesna was accompanied only by a reduction in spinal Fos activity, the supraspinal activities remaining high and in strict relationship with the vagal afferent activity. In conclusion, the uroprotective effect of mesna, which requires appropriate posologies, has led to the confirmation of the spinal actions of the CP cystitis, probably via the pelvic nerve, but did not allow a clear distinction between the consequences of the systemic (vagal) and local (spinal, pelvic) actions of CP at supraspinal level.
Ceftriaxone is a widely used third-generation cephalosporin. It is generally very safe, but complications of biliary pseudolithiasis and, rarely, nephrolithiasis have been reported in children. These complications generally resolve spontaneously with cessation of the ceftriaxone therapy; however, they may symptomatically mimic more serious clinical problems, such as cholecystitis. We report a case of both ceftriaxone-induced biliary pseudolithiasis and nephrolithiasis.
Disopyramide (Norpace) is a widely used, generally well tolerated antiarrhythmic agent. We have described an 82-year-old patient with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency who had hypoglycemic coma and obstructive uropathy due to disopyramide therapy.
Sustained cardiac adrenergic stimulation has been implicated in the development and progression of heart failure. Release of norepinephrine is controlled by negative feedback from presynaptic alpha2-adrenergic receptors, and the targets of the released norepinephrine on myocytes are beta1-adrenergic receptors. In transfected cells, a polymorphic alpha2C-adrenergic receptor (alpha2CDel322-325) has decreased function, and a variant of the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1Arg389) has increased function. We hypothesized that this combination of receptor variants, which results in increased synaptic norepinephrine release and enhanced receptor function at the myocyte, would predispose persons to heart failure.
Genotyping at these loci was performed in 159 patients with heart failure and 189 controls. Logistic-regression methods were used to determine the potential effect of each genotype and the interaction between them on the risk of heart failure.
Among black subjects, the adjusted odds ratio for heart failure among persons who were homozygous for alpha2CDel322-325 as compared with those with the other alpha2C-adrenergic receptor genotypes was 5.65 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.67 to 11.95; P<0.001). There was no increase in risk with beta1Arg389 alone. However, there was a marked increase in the risk of heart failure among persons who were homozygous for both variants (adjusted odds ratio, 10.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.11 to 48.53; P=0.004). The patients with heart failure did not differ from the controls in the frequencies of nine short tandem-repeat alleles. Among white subjects, there were too few who were homozygous for both polymorphisms to allow an adequate assessment of risk.
The alpha2CDel322-325 and beta1Arg389 receptors act synergistically to increase the risk of heart failure in blacks. Genotyping at these two loci may be a useful approach for identification of persons at risk for heart failure or its progression, who may be candidates for early preventive measures.
We describe a patient with severe nodulocystic acne who developed disabling muscle stiffness and painful superimposed spasms of the neck, back and upper limbs 10 days after the onset of oral isotretinoin treatment. The muscle hyperactivity condition, which revealed the clinical and electromyographic features of the stiff-person syndrome, gradually resolved 2 weeks after drug withdrawal.
A 40-year-old male medical student presented with urticarial vasculitis secondary to occupational formaldehyde exposure. Serum sickness and delayed pressure urticaria also featured prominently during his illness. Initial symptom control was achieved with oral prednisolone (25 mg/day tapered to zero over 2 weeks) and oral antihistamine therapy (fexofenadine 180 mg once daily, promethazine 20 mg once daily, ranitidine 150 mg twice daily); however, subsequent exposures to formaldehyde produced transient symptom flares that broke through the prednisolone cover. A complete recovery occurred only after strict elimination of all exposure to formaldehyde, both occupationally and in the home environment, was achieved.
Forty-two patients with locally advanced breast cancer (n = 8) or recurrent breast cancer (n = 34) received regional chemotherapy (mitoxantrone 25 mg/m2 per 24 h) via the internal mammary artery or other vessels of the subclavian artery. To prevent artery thrombosis 500-1000 U heparin per hour were administered i.v. Tumour perfusion was monitored by intra-arterial angio-CT. Remission rates (CR + PR) were 100% (primary breast cancer) and 89% (recurrent tumours), respectively. Intra-arterial chemotherapy was well tolerated. No complications were noted.
One of the proposed mechanisms by which phenobarbital (PB) promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat is by differential mitoinhibition. However, our earlier studies indicated that PB inhibited DNA synthesis in vitro in hepatocytes isolated from both surrounding non-nodular liver and hepatic nodules promoted by orotic acid (OA). Since nodules generated by one promoter need not necessarily be resistant to another promoter, the present study was undertaken to determine whether foci/nodules promoted by PB itself are resistant to the mitoinhibitory effects of PB. Accordingly, rats were initiated with diethylnitrosamine (DENA, 200 mg/kg i.p) and promoted with PB (0.07% of PB as its sodium salt) in their drinking water for 16 or 33 weeks. In vitro studies indicated that PB (3-5 mM) inhibited DNA synthesis induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in hepatocytes from surrounding non-nodular liver as well as from nodules promoted by PB for 33 weeks. In another experiment, initiated rats exposed to PB for 33 weeks were subjected to either two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) or sham hepatectomy. Hepatocytes were labelled with tritiated thymidine in vivo for 48 h. Autoradiographic analysis indicated that in the presence of PB, the hepatocytes from both foci/nodules and the surrounding non-nodular liver responded to PH to the same extent. In addition, they both responded to PH less efficiently as compared to the corresponding controls. Further, initiated rats exposed to PB for 16 weeks when subjected to PH and killed 4 weeks thereafter, the percentage area occupied by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive foci/nodules in the PB group increased, but to the same extent as in initiated control rats not exposed to PB. The above results raised an interesting possibility that the lack of resistance of the PB-promoted nodules to the mitoinhibitory effects of PB may be because the PB-promoted nodule does not express a resistant phenotype. To examine this aspect, the response of hepatocytes from 33 week PB-promoted nodules to the mitoinhibitory effects of OA was examined. The results indicated that OA (60-120 microM) inhibited EGF-induced DNA synthesis in hepatocytes isolated from both nodules as well as from surrounding non-nodular liver. These results suggest that PB is a mitoinhibitor but may not provide a strong differential growth advantage to foci/nodules in response to a proliferative stimulus. Further, the nodules promoted by PB do not appear to express the resistant phenotype, defined as being resistant to the mitoinhibitory effects of OA and PB.
The aims of this review are to examine the biochemical features of theophylline, caffeine, adenosine, and dipyridamole, their effects on coronary hyperemia, and to make recommendations on performing hyperemic lesion assessment after taking caffeine or theophylline.
It is commonly thought that caffeine and theophylline interfere with adenosine and dipyridamole induced coronary hyperemia, thus frequently delaying scheduled assessments after inadvertent consumption. However, a limited amount of studies address the interactions of these substances thus leaving no clear consensus on when to delay coronary assessment after their intake.
For biochemical information on each substance, online and textbook references were utilized. For studies on the interactions of the substances with coronary hyperemia, broad search terms such as "caffeine AND adenosine" were applied in the major research data bases.
A serum caffeine level of 3 to 4 mg/L at the time of an adenosine-hyperemia study does not affect the ability of perfusion stress imaging to detect coronary artery disease. The interactions of theophylline with adenosine-hyperemia are less clear while both caffeine and theophylline show significant interaction with dipyridamole-hyperemia.
For dipyridamole-stress myocardial perfusion studies, caffeine products and theophylline medications should be discontinued for 24 hr. For adenosine-stress myocardial perfusion studies, theophylline medications should be discontinued for 12 hr; however, one cup of coffee may be taken up to 1 hr before the test without necessitating a delay or cancellation of the study. These same considerations hold true for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and intravenous adenosine-induced hyperemia.
First-line therapies available for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have increased rapidly with the recent introduction of three novel agents: sunitinib, temsirolimus and bevacizumab (in combination with interferon [IFN]). This expansion means that the selection of the optimal therapy for individual patients has become more difficult and increasingly important. A treatment algorithm based on tumour histology and patient risk status is currently used to guide clinical practice, but does not always allow specific treatment for individual patients to be identified. This is particularly true for the largest group of patients, who have favourable or intermediate risk clear cell RCC. Considerations guiding treatment selection for these patients include: potential for cure; and optimal progression-free survival (PFS) with good tolerability and quality of life. In patients who have a realistic opportunity for cure, bevacizumab combined with IFN might be the treatment of choice. However, sunitinib and bevacizumab combined with IFN produce similar PFS. Thus, if optimal PFS is the treatment goal, other factors must be considered. These include patient-related factors such as the needs, circumstances and comorbidities of individual patients and the associated side effects of bevacizumab combined with IFN and sunitinib. More data are currently available to support treatment decisions based on the latter and these are considered in detail, highlighting factors that may lead to selection of bevacizumab combined with IFN or sunitinib in individual patients.
To compare ceftriaxone with cefuroxime for the treatment of meningitis, we conducted a study in which 106 children with acute bacterial meningitis were randomly assigned to receive either ceftriaxone (100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, administered intravenously once daily; n = 53) or cefuroxime (240 mg per kilogram per day, administered intravenously in four equal doses; n = 53). The mean age of the children was 3 years (range, 42 days to 16 years), and the characteristics of the two treatment groups were comparable at admission. Excluded from the study were eight other children who died within 48 hours of admission. After 18 to 36 hours of therapy, cultures of cerebrospinal fluid remained positive for 1 of the 52 children (2 percent) receiving ceftriaxone for whom cultures were available and 6 of 52 (12 percent) receiving cefuroxime (P = 0.11). In both groups the mean duration of antibiotic therapy was 10 days. The clinical responses to therapy were similar in the two treatment groups, and all 106 children were cured. Reversible biliary pseudolithiasis was detected by serial abdominal ultrasonography only in the children treated with ceftriaxone (16 of 35 vs. 0 of 35; P less than 0.001). The treatment of three children was switched from ceftriaxone to alternative antibiotics because these children had upper abdominal pain. Other side effects were infrequent in both groups. At follow-up examination two months later, moderate-to-profound hearing loss was present in two children (4 percent) treated with ceftriaxone and in nine (17 percent) treated with cefuroxime (P = 0.05); other neurologic abnormalities were similar in the two treatment groups. We conclude that ceftriaxone is superior to cefuroxime for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis in children and that the benefits of milder hearing impairment and more rapid sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid with ceftriaxone outweigh the problem of reversible biliary pseudolithiasis with this drug.
Treatment with ceftriaxone may be accompanied by precipitation of ceftriaxone calcium salts in the gallbladder, called pseudolithiasis. We present a case, in which a formerly healthy five year-old girl developed symptomatic pseudolithiasis during treatment with Rocephalin. The symptoms and pseudolithiasis disappeared after a few days with symptomatic treatment and change of antibiotics.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the factors influencing the cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs. In the present study we compared the expression of the NER proteins ERCC1 and XPF in 24 testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) with the corresponding normal testicular tissue of the same patient. Using immunoblotting, we demonstrated in TGCT a significant increase of ERCC1 expression compared to the normal tissue. There was no significant increase in XPF expression in TCGT. Based on histological characteristics TGCT are subgrouped into seminomas and non-seminomas, the latter being clinically more aggressive. Investigating ERCC1 levels in seminomas we found a slightly increased expression compared to normal tissue, which was, however, not significant. Similarly, no significant difference was observed for XPF levels in seminomas compared to normal testis tissue. In non-seminomas, however, we found a significant increase in the expression of ERCC1 (p<0.017) and XPF (p<0.03) when compared with the corresponding normal tissue. Comparing seminomas with non-seminomas, we observed a significant increase in the expression of ERCC1 (p<0.05) and XPF (p<0.007) in the non-seminomas. Furthermore, a correlation between the expression of ERCC1 and XPF was observed. Our data demonstrate that non-seminomas are characterized by an increased expression of ERCC1 and XPF protein compared to seminomas and the normal testis tissue. The data indicate a possible up-regulation of ERCC1 and XPF during TGCT progression.
Based on phase II trial results, chemoimmunotherapy combinations have become the preferred treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma in many institutions. This study was performed to determine whether interleukin-2 (IL-2) as a component of chemoimmunotherapy influences survival of patients with metastatic melanoma.
Patients with advanced metastatic melanoma were randomly assigned to receive dacarbazine 250 mg/m2 and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 combined with interferon-alfa-2b 10 x 10(6) U/m2 subcutaneously on days 1 through 5 without (arm A) or with (arm B) a high-dose intravenous decrescendo regimen of IL-2 on days 5 through 10 (18 x 10(6) U/m2/6 hours, 18 x 10(6) U/m2/12 hours, 18 x 10(6) U/m2/24 hours, and 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2 for 3 x 24 hours). Treatment cycles were repeated in the absence of disease progression every 28 days to a maximum of four cycles.
Three hundred sixty-three patients with advanced metastatic melanoma were accrued. The median survival was 9 months in both arms, with a 2-year survival rate of 12.9% and 17.6% in arms A and B, respectively (P = .32; hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.11). There was also no statistically significant difference regarding progression-free survival (median, 3.0 v 3.9 months) and response rate (22.8% v 20.8%).
Despite its activity in melanoma as a single agent or in combination with interferon-alfa-2b, the chosen schedule of IL-2 added to the chemoimmunotherapy combination had no clinically relevant activity.
We sought to determine whether menopausal status or postmenopausal hypercholesterolemia affects forearm resistance artery endothelial function. We studied the forearm resistance artery endothelial function in 75 Japanese women: 25 premenopausal volunteers, 25 postmenopausal women with normal serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, and 25 hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women. Excluded from the study were patients with hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, or diabetes, cigarette smokers. The forearm blood flow (FBF) during reactive hyperemia and after sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) administration was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. The serum concentrations of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] were significantly higher in the hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal group than in the other two groups (P<0.01). These lipid parameters were similar between the premenopausal and postmenopausal women with normal cholesterol. The FBF responses to reactive hyperemia were significantly lower in the postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women than in the other two groups (P<0.01). The reactive hyperemia also was impaired in the postmenopausal group with normal cholesterol as compared with the premenopausal group (P<0.01). Increases in FBF after NTG were similar between the three groups. By stepwise multivariate analysis, menopausal status and serum LDL cholesterol was the significant predictor of forearm endothelial function. These findings suggest that reactive hyperemia is impaired in forearm resistance arteries after menopause, especially in postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia.
Forty patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma treated with vincristine between 1984 and 1990 (cumulative dose 12 mg in 18-24 weeks) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system. The patients were interviewed with emphasis on neuropathic symptoms. Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed, four to 77 months (median 34 months) after vincristine treatment. Twenty-seven patients reported neuropathic symptoms. In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination. In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated. In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past. Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy. There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination. Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients. Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term. It is concluded that with the above mentioned vincristine dose schedule signs and symptoms of vincristine neuropathy are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good.
We have characterised for the first time the general and neurological side effects experienced when using a series of chronic non-lethal cisplatin + paclitaxel schedules in Wistar rats, selected according to our previous experience and the animals' maximum tolerated dose. At the pathological level, the use of combination schedules was definitely more toxic at the kidney and sternal bone marrow level than the single-agent schedules. At the neurophysiological examination based on the assessment of the nerve conduction velocity measurement in the tail nerve, we identified only one combination schedule that was more neurotoxic than the similar schedules based on single-agent administration. This observation was confirmed by the neuropathological examination performed on the sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia, ventral and dorsal roots. Our study supports the hypothesis that the general and, to a lesser extent, neurological effects of a combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel are different from those of the administration of both drugs as single agents. We believe that these models may be useful for testing neuroprotective strategies.
Six anthracycline antibiotics with demonstrated antitumor activity in human or experimental tumor systems were studied. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the cardiotoxic potential of these compounds and to characterize the myocardial pharmacokinetics in order to provide a possible explanation for differences in cardiotoxicity. Groups of rabbits received i.v. injections of drug at maximally tolerated treatment doses with respect to lymphohematopoietic toxicity for periods of 11 or 16 weeks and were evaluated histopathologically for the development of myocardial damage. Following a single i.v. administration of the different anthracyclines to rabbits, the amount of parent drug and metabolites accumulating in the heart at various times was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and fluorometry. Adriamycin (ADR), daunorubicin (DNR), and detorubicin produced similar severe cardiomyopathy with frequent congestive heart failure at approximately equal dose levels. Three additional antibiotics, rubidazone and the N-L-leucyl derivatives of ADR and DNR (N-L-leucyl-adriamycin and N-L-leucyl-daunorubicin), produced significantly less severe lymphohematopoietic toxicity, thus permitting the administration of 3 to 3.5 times the ADR and DNR treatment doses. Chronic treatment with these anthracyclines also resulted in significantly less cardiomyopathy, especially in the case of N-L-leucyl-daunorubicin and rubidazone. This reduced cardiomyopathy correlated with lower total myocardial drug accumulation but, more importantly, with lower amounts of DNR or ADR accumulation in the heart. These findings suggest that the degree of anthracycline myocardial toxicity may be directly related to the relative qualitative and quantitative accumulation of drug metabolites in the myocardium.
The occurrence of urinary calculi associated with acetazolamide therapy is described. Patients with a history of urinary stones or surgery are a significant risk for further calculus formation when treated with acetazolamide. The concurrent use of sodium bicarbonate further potentiates this risk.
An analysis of the mortality experience of workers exposed to dinitrotoluene (DNT) was conducted to test the hypothesis that DNT exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancers of the liver and biliary tract. A total of 4,989 workers exposed to DNT and 7,436 unexposed workers who had worked for at least 5 months at the study facility between January 1, 1949 and January 21, 1980, were included in this investigation. Workers were considered exposed if they had worked at least 1 day on a job with probable exposure to DNT. The vital status as of December 31, 1982, was successfully ascertained for approximately 97% of these workers. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated based upon comparisons with the US population using a modified life-table program. In addition, standardized rate ratios (SRRs) were computed based upon direct comparisons between the DNT and the internal unexposed cohort. An excess of hepatobiliary cancer was observed among workers exposed to DNT in this study. The rate ratio for hepatobiliary cancer was 2.67 (six cases observed) based upon comparison with the US population (SMR = 2.67, 95% CI = 0.98, 5.83), and 3.88 based upon comparison using the internal unexposed referent group (SRR = 3.88, 95% CI = 1.04, 14.41). This study failed to demonstrate an exposure-response relationship between duration of DNT exposure and hepatobiliary cancer mortality. Our study was limited by the small number of workers with long duration of exposure to DNT, and by the lack of quantitative information on exposure to DNT and other chemicals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Gnetum gnemon is an arboreal dioecious plant that is cultivated in Indonesia. The seeds of this species mainly contain dimeric stilbenoid compounds [gnetin C (1), gnemonoside A (2), and gnemonoside D (3)] along with trans-resveratrol (4). trans-Resveratrol has been reported to have antiaging, anticancer, and antidiabetic effects, as well as being a calorie restriction mimetic. SIRT1 exerts a protective effect against vascular senescence. In this study, the effects of these four main stilbenoid derivatives of a G. gnemon seed endosperm ethanolic extract on endothelial senescence were investigated. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, administration of the G. gnemon ethanolic extract increased SIRT1 and decreased endothelial senescence. The concentration of 1 in blood plasma was 6-fold higher than 4 in these mice. Next, the in vitro effects of the four main stilbenoid derivatives of G. gnemon seeds were investigated. Senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells were induced by hydrogen peroxide. Endothelial senescence was inhibited by 4, which increased the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and SIRT1, whereas 1-3 had no effect. These results indicated that the ethanolic extract of G. gnemon seeds inhibits endothelial senescence, suggesting that 4 plays a critical role in the prevention of endothelial senescence.
Calcineurin inhibitors potentially contribute to risk of cardiovascular events through the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The exact extent to which calcineurin inhibitors affect these risk factors is difficult to establish since pre-existing renal disease and concomitant immunosuppressive agents (such as steroids or TOR inhibitors) also exert an effect. Clinical trials have consistently shown a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus with tacrolimus, which has been borne out in large-scale registry analyses. However, the risk of hypertension is approximately 5% higher with cyclosporine than tacrolimus, as is the risk of hyperlipidemia. Statin therapy is effective in treating dyslipidemia and has significant benefits in renal transplant patients. An individualized approach to choice of calcineurin inhibitor, by which cyclosporine or tacrolimus are selected based on the patient's particular risk profile, may thus help to reduce the toll of cardiovascular mortality among renal transplant recipients in the future.
The use and abuse of cocaine is increasingly frequent in many countries, and the associated problems are increasingly evident. The effects of cocaine in the oral cavity vary depending on the form used and the route of self-administration. In the present study we describe the lesions observed in four patients with a history of topical self-application of cocaine to the oral and/or nasal mucosa, with the aim of relieving pain produced by cocaine-induced cluster headache. In three of the four patients this practice has led to erythematous lesions, while the remaining patient showed gingival recession and bone sequestration. These lesions can probably be attributed to the vasoconstrictor activity of cocaine, and to its caustic effects on the mucosa.
Cytochrome P450 4B1 (CYP4B1) is involved in the metabolism of several xenobiotics, such as 2-aminofluorene, 2-naphthylamine and benzidine. CYP4B1 allelic variants CYP4B1*1-*7 were recently identified. We thus hypothesized that CYP4B1 genotypes may modify bladder cancer risk. We examined the CYP4B1 genotypes in 169 bladder cancer cases and 190 hospital controls using a hybridization probe assay. Among the CYP4B1 genotypes observed, the most frequent genotypes in both the groups were CYP4B1*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3 and *2/*2. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the subjects carrying the CYP4B1*1/*2 or *2/*2 genotypes had a 1.75-fold increased risk of bladder cancer (95% CI=1.03-2.95, P = 0.038) compared with the subjects carrying the CYP4B1*1/*1 genotype. We demonstrated the first genetic study regarding the association of CYP4B1 with bladder cancer. Our results suggest that CYP4B1 genotypes might have an effect on the risk of bladder cancer.
