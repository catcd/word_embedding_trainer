Dual porphyrias are characterized by two independent disturbances of porphyrin metabolism.
At first a porphyria cutanea tarda was diagnosed in a 26-year-old female with back pain and red urine. Later a hereditary coproporphyria was ascertained by additional examinations. The metabolites of porphyrin metabolism were analyzed chromatographically. The activities of coproporphyrinogen oxidase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase were determined in blood cells. Molecular analysis was carried out by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by direct sequencing.
Excessive porphyrinuria of 3,128 nmol/24 h (normal < 165 nmol/24 h) with dominance of uro- and heptacarboxyporphyrin (75% of total porphyrins) indicated that the patient suffered from porphyria cutanea tarda. The course of the examination showed an alteration of the constellation with dominance of urinary and fecal coproporphyrin isomer III, which is characteristic for hereditary coproporphyria. Porphyrin precursors and porphyrins increased under the application of ethinylestradiol-cyproteronacetat. The dominance of coproporphyrin III stayed constant in feces besides enhanced urinary uro- and heptacarboxyporphyrin. The activity of the coproporphyrinogen oxidase was diminished to 35%. The uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase in erythrocytes was normal. The mother and both sisters were recognized as heterozygous gene carriers of hereditary coproporphyria in the latent phase by enhanced coproporphyrin with isomer I/III inversion in feces and decrease of the coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity to about 50%. Molecular analyses resulted in a point mutation at exon 4 (854C-->T), which revealed in an amino acid exchange (P258L) in the coproporphyrinogen oxidase protein.
The hereditary coproporphyria is caused by a new mutation in the coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene in the case of a dual porphyria with co-existence of porphyria cutanea tarda and hereditary coproporphyria. The sporadic, hepatic porphyria cutanea tarda Type I is induced by estrogens. The large excretory variations reflect the influence of hormonal factors on the porphyria process of hereditary coproporphyria and porphyria cutanea tarda.
A new SERM, CHF 4227.01, given to 6-month-old female rats immediately after ovariectomy, preserved bone mass and bone microarchitecture without affecting uterus weight. It also decreased serum cholesterol and fat mass in estrogen-deficient rats.
We tested the effect of a new benzopyran derivative, CHF 4227.01, with selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) activity on bone mass and biomechanics in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats in comparison with 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EST), raloxifene (RLX), and lasofoxifene (LFX).
Four doses of CHF 4227.01 (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg body weight [bw]/day) were administered in OVX animals daily by gavage 5 days/week for 4 months. EST was administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, whereas RLX and LSX were administered at doses of 1 and 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, by gavage. In one group (Sham), rats were operated but the ovaries not removed; another OVX group was treated only with placebo.
Treatment with CHF 4227.01 (1.0 and 0.1 mg/kg bw), EST (0.1 mg/kg bw), LFX (0.1 mg/kg bw), or RLX (1.0 mg/kg bw) prevented bone loss on the lumbar spine and the proximal femur assessed in vivo by DXA. Volumetric BMD obtained by pQCT ex vivo confirmed protection from bone loss in the spine and proximal femur among rats treated with CHF 4227.01. This effect was associated with strong inhibition of bone resorption both histologically and biochemically. Furthermore, CHF 4227.01 preserved trabecular microarchitecture, analyzed by muCT, and maintained biomechanical indices of bone strength in the spine and proximal femur, effects also observed for RLX, whereas LSX was less protective of microarchitecture. CHF 4227.01 treatment did not affect uterine weight, prevented the increase in body weight and fat mass seen in OVX animals, and decreased serum cholesterol to below the average of intact animals. In conclusion, CHF 4227.01 exhibits a promising therapeutic and safety profile as a new SERM on both skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes.
Mitochondrial ribosomal RNA mutation has been shown to predispose affected individuals to aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss (AIHL). An A-to-G nucleotide substitution at the 1555 position within the 12S ribosomal RNA gene has been identified with a maternally inherited pattern in affected Asian pedigrees. The aim of this study was to identify the frequency of this DNA polymorphism in subjects who appear to show hypersensitivity to topical (middle ear) application of aminoglycoside. In this pilot study, 10 subjects with AIHL were recruited. Eight underwent vestibular ablative therapy with middle ear instillation of gentamicin for disabling vertigo, and two were treated with topical antibiotic drops for otitis media in the presence of a tympanic perforation. DNA samples were extracted, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used for gene amplification and purification, searching for 1555 A-to-G substitution in the 12S ribosomal RNA gene. None of the subjects demonstrated this specific mutation.
A double-blind study was carried out in 24 hypertensive patients with thiazide-induced hypokalaemia (serum potassium less than 3.2 mmol/l) to compare the effects of treatment with an amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide combination or hydrochlorothiazide alone. The study was divided into three phases: (i) potassium repletion (Weeks 0 to 4) with oral potassium chloride (40 mmol/day), (ii) stabilization (Weeks 4 to 6) of normokalaemia, and (iii) active drug treatment (Weeks 6 to 14), patients being allocated at random to receive one or other of the two treatments. Dosage was 2 tablets per day of the 5 mg amiloride plus 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide combination or of 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone. The results showed that blood pressure control was comparable in both treatment groups but hydrochlorothiazide alone caused a statistically significant reduction in serum potassium levels compared to the drug combination. Apart from 1 patient who developed hypokalaemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone, no other side-effects of treatment were reported.
Invasive disease due to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) resistant to chloramphenicol and ampicillin is rare in the United States. Review of the literature reveals that all previously reported cases occurred in children with meningitis. These children were treated initially with ampicillin and chloramphenicol and had complicated courses characterized by delayed sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid. The present report describes an infant who developed meningitis due to ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant Hib. The patient received cefotaxime from the onset of therapy and had an uncomplicated course. The presence of Hib strains resistant to chloramphenicol and ampicillin should be considered in patients with meningitis due to Hib who respond poorly to treatment with these two drugs. Furthermore, the in vitro susceptibility of all Hib isolates to chloramphenicol (as well as to other antimicrobial agents) should be evaluated routinely. If the incidence of such resistant organisms increases, a change will be warranted in the commonly recommended combination of ampicillin and chloramphenicol as empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis in pediatric patients.
The broad spectrum of aspirin-sensitive erythromelalgia, its microvascular ischemic complications, migraine-like atypical or typical transient ischemic attacks (cerebral and ocular) as well as acute coronary syndromes in thrombocythemia vera (essential thrombocythemia and thrombocythemia associated with polycythemia vera in maintained remission by phlebotomy) is caused by platelet cyclo-oxygenase-mediated arteriolar inflammation, fibromuscular intimal proliferation without and with occlusive thrombosis by platelet-rich thrombi in the end-arterial microvasculature of the peripheral, cerebral, ocular and coronary circulation. These microvascular ischemic and thrombotic complications does not respond to Coumadin, but are immediately relieved by a loading dose of 500 mg aspirin, and does not recur when the patient is maintained on low dose aspirin (50 mg per day) or after reduction of platelet counts to normal (<400.000/microl).
Renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD) is a developmental abnormality of the renal proximal tubules found in patients with Potter syndrome. We report a female newborn with RTD who has survived for more than 18 months. Infusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the early neonatal period were effective in raising and maintaining her blood pressure. Peritoneal dialysis was required until the appearance of spontaneous urination at 29 days after birth. Histopathological examinations of the kidney revealed dilated renal tubular lumina and foamy columnar epithelial cells in the renal tubules. Endocrinological studies showed a discrepancy between low plasma renin activity (<0.1 ng/ml/hr) and high active renin concentration (135,000 pg/ml), suggesting an aberration in the renin substrate, angiotensinogen. Direct sequencing analysis revealed two novel mutations in the coding region of the angiotensinogen gene (AGT): a nonsense mutation in exon 2 (c.604C > T) and a frameshift deletion at nucleotide 1290 in exon 5 (c.1290delT). The mutations were in the compound heterozygous state, because each parent had each mutation. These findings suggest that angiotensinogen deficiency is one of the causes of RTD. A treatment of the condition with FFP may help to promote long survival.
This study of first-line treatment in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma patients analysed the effects of MCP (mitoxantrone, chlorambucil and prednisolone) chemotherapy alone or in combination with rituximab (R-MCP) on circulating lymphoma cells (CLC) and assessed the prognostic value of a quantitative monitoring of CLC. CLC numbers were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the t(14;18)-translocation or by allele-specific PCR for rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. We analysed blood samples from 43 patients treated in a randomized trial comparing eight cycles of MCP versus R-MCP. Clearance of CLC at the end of therapy was achieved in 21/25 patients (84%) treated with R-MCP compared with 0/18 after MCP alone (P < 0.0001). A > or = 2 log CLC reduction was associated with a favourable clinical response (P = 0.0004) and prolonged event-free survival (P = 0.02). In R-MCP patients, stable CLC numbers or consistently PCR-negative blood samples were associated with a continuing clinical remission whereas in two patients a relapse was preceded by a > or = 2 log CLC increase. This study demonstrated that R-MCP led to a rapid and sustained eradication of CLC and a > or = 2 log CLC reduction was associated with a superior quality and duration of the clinical response.
The efficacy of astemizole, diphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria was evaluated in this 3-month double-blind, randomized, parallel group study. Thirty-six adult patients were randomly assigned, 13 to the astemizole group (10 mg daily), 12 to the diphenhydramine group (25 mg t.i.d.), and 11 to the hydroxyzine hydrochloride group (25 mg t.i.d.). Demographic data were statistically similar for all variables assessed in the three treatment groups. Seven (58%) of the diphenhydramine patients withdrew before the end of the study, six because of lack of efficacy and one because of drowsiness. Two (18%) of the hydroxyzine hydrochloride patients withdrew, one because of lack of efficacy and one because of drowsiness. Two patients (15%) in the astemizole group withdrew, one because of adverse reaction, and the other because of lack of efficacy. Mean total symptom scores and mean individual symptom scores were lower in the astemizole group than in the other two groups. Wheal area measurements (0.1 mg/mL histamine challenge) decreased more in the astemizole and hydroxyzine hydrochloride groups than in the diphenhydramie group (P = .02). With regard to symptoms, 12/13 patients in the astemizole group improved clinically during their treatment period, versus 8/11 in the hydroxyzine hydrochloride group and 5/12 in the diphenhydramine group. The mean time to first observed therapeutic effect (maintained for three consecutive days) was 5.5 days in the astemizole group, 10.9 days in the hydroxyzine hydrochloride group, and 7.2 days in the diphenhydramine group. In this study, astemizole was as effective as hydroxyzine in patients treated for chronic idiopathic urticaria.
Agonist replacement therapies are effective for managing substance abuse disorders including nicotine and opioid dependence. The results of preclinical laboratory studies and clinical trials indicate that agonist replacements like D-amphetamine may be a viable option for managing cocaine dependence. This experiment determined the physiological and behavioral effects of cocaine during D-amphetamine maintenance in seven cocaine-dependent participants. We predicted cocaine would be well tolerated during D-amphetamine maintenance. We also predicted D-amphetamine would attenuate the behavioral effects of cocaine. After 3-5 days of D-amphetamine maintenance (0, 15, and 30 mg/day), volunteers were administered ascending doses of cocaine (4, 30, 60 mg, i.n.) within a single session. Cocaine doses were separated by 90 min. Cocaine produced prototypical physiological (e.g., increased heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature) and subject-rated (e.g., increased ratings of Good Effects) effects. During maintenance on the highest D-amphetamine dose, the heart rate increasing effects of cocaine were larger than observed during placebo maintenance. These effects were not clinically significant and no unexpected or serious adverse events were observed. D-amphetamine attenuated some of the subject-rated effects of cocaine. These results are concordant with those of previous preclinical studies, human laboratory experiments and clinical trials, further suggesting that agonist replacement therapy may be a viable strategy for managing cocaine abuse. Additional research in humans is needed to determine whether D-amphetamine attenuates the effects of cocaine under different experimental conditions (e.g., higher cocaine doses) and behavioral arrangements (e.g., drug self-administration or discrimination).
An 11 year old boy from whom Salmonella typhi had been isolated was treated with ciprofloxacin. He developed non-oliguric acute renal failure that was treated successfully.
A patient with AIDS and toxoplasmic encephalitis treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine became hypovolemic and developed acute renal failure. Diagnostic sulfadiazine crystals were abundant in the urine, and ultrasound examination demonstrated sludge and stones, presumably due to sulfadiazine. Renal failure resolved rapidly with hydration and administration of alkali, despite continued administration of sulfadiazine. The relatively old literature concerning crystalluria and renal failure due to sulfonamides is reviewed briefly, since complications due to use of poorly soluble sulfonamides probably will become more widespread as toxoplasmic encephalitis becomes more prevalent.
Logically, the choice of any ultimate optimum therapy requires, as well as comparison of the survival outcomes, a comparison of both subjective and objective toxicities in terms of incidence, degree of severity, and duration. Frequently such detail is not collected in large studies. Both cisplatin and paclitaxel are effective but neurotoxic drugs for ovarian cancer. The optimum choice is further complicated in that carboplatin is a possible alternative for cisplatin, being less neurotoxic but having greater hematologic toxicity. Similarly, 3-h and 24-h infusion schedules of paclitaxel have different incidences in opposite directions of hematologic and neurologic toxicities. One hundred fifty two eligible Canadian patients entered in a European-Canadian study that compared paclitaxel-cisplatin (PT, 79) patients with cyclophosphamide-cisplatin (PC, 73 patients) had both subjective and objective neurotoxicity data collected from treatment initiation to disease progression. Incidence, degree, and duration (compared in an analogous way to remission durations) of neurotoxicity were compared in the two arms to quantify the additional paclitaxel toxicity. No significant differences were found for motor toxicity, motor impairment, hearing impairment, or insomnia. For sensory changes during treatment, toxicity (all grades, 91% vs. 49%; grade 3 or higher, 29% vs. 3%) incidence, subjective impairment (a little or more, 89% vs. 40%; lots, 54% vs. 11%) incidence, and toxicity duration (all grades only), and impairment durations (both degrees) were all worse for PT. During follow-up, only the incidence of all-grade sensory toxicity was worse and this was not reflected by any other parameters. We conclude that paclitaxel adds considerably, but only temporarily, to the sensoy neurotoxicity of cisplatin.
Indinavir is a well-known cause of crystal-induced acute renal failure, dysuria and flank pain, and nephrolithiasis. Recently a more insidious tubulointerstitial lesion has been recognized as secondary to the drug. We report a case of a hepatitis C-positive patient on long-term indinavir therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who developed a slowly progressive rise in serum creatinine. Renal biopsy revealed a diffuse interstitial infiltrate with numerous eosinophils and scarring. The tubules showed focal necrosis and dilation with elongated crystals present within their lumina. The elevated serum creatinine decreased to a new baseline over several months with the discontinuation of indinavir. We review the literature of renal syndromes associated with indinavir focusing on chronic progressive tubulointerstitial injury and speculate on risk factors and potential mechanisms of indinavir-induced renal injury.
Inhibition of p38 kinase blocks the production of tumor-promoting factors in the multiple myeloma (MM) bone marrow microenvironment. Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib have been shown to have direct cytotoxic effects on MM cells. We show that a selective inhibitor of p38alpha, SCIO-469, enhances the ability of MG132 and bortezomib to induce the apoptosis of MM cells. Previously, we showed that p38 inhibition with SCIO-469 enhances MM cytotoxicity of bortezomib by inhibiting the transient expression and phosphorylation of Hsp27, a downstream target of p38. Here we show that continued treatment of MM cells with bortezomib leads to a SCIO-469-enhanced downregulation of Hsp27 and to increased MM apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that p38 inhibition enhances the bortezomib-induced MM apoptosis by upregulation of p53 and downregulation of Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1. In a mouse xenograft plasmacytoma model of MM, we found that inhibiting p38 augments the effects of bortezomib in decreasing MM tumor growth in vivo. Thus, in addition to its role in suppressing an activated MM microenvironment, co-treatment with a p38 inhibitor, such as SCIO-469, may enhance the cytotoxicity of bortezomib by modulating pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors in MM cells, suggesting great potential for co-therapy.
Hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by repeated attacks of swelling of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, face, larynx, and other organs. In most cases it is caused by low levels of functional C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), a serine protease inhibitor that plays important regulatory roles in the complement, contact, and fibrinolytic pathways.
Lack of functional C1-INH results in excessive release of bradykinin, which triggers vasodilation, vascular permeability, and edema. Most attacks are mild and self-limiting, but untreated laryngeal attacks may cause rapid asphyxiation and death. Potential triggers of laryngeal attacks include trauma to or manipulation of the face, mouth, or upper airway. Therefore, before performing such a procedure in a patient with HAE, the otolaryngologist should consult with the patient, the physician managing the HAE, and the anesthesiologist and make appropriate preparations for prevention and/or treatment of an attack.
Current World Allergy Organization and European guidelines recommend the use of i.v. plasma-derived C1-INH replacement for short-term prophylaxis of angioedema attacks. Other effective options include danazol given for several days before and after the procedure and fresh-frozen plasma, but these may not be as effective as C1-INH and may be associated with a high rate of adverse events.
Acute attacks, which may occur many hours after a procedure, may be treated with C1-INH; icatibant, a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist; or ecallantide, a kallikrein inhibitor, all of which have been shown to reduce the duration and severity of HAE attacks.
It is not known whether recombinant human erythropoietin has a direct, clinically apparent pressor effect in hemodialysis patients or whether hypertension developing or aggravated in these patients merely reflects increased hematocrit. We compared blood pressure after three different methods of partial correction of anemia in hemodialysis patients with similar baseline hematocrits (erythropoietin n = 12, intravenous iron alone n = 10, androgens n = 9). Shortly after the start of treatment and with a minimally increased hematocrit, the need for antihypertensive medication increased in the erythropoietin group. No such pressor effect was observed with iron or androgens. These data suggest a direct hypertensive effect of erythropoietin in some patients on hemodialysis.
Amiodarone is currently indicated for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias. It is also used for the treatment of supraventricular dysrhythmias and as maintenance therapy after successful cardioversion of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. Adverse effects related to its expanded use are increasingly common. We describe a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis occurring 5 months after cessation of therapy and discuss the pathophysiology and treatment of this disorder.
43 patients, 3 days to 12 years old, presented 68 paroxysms of supraventricular tachycardia and 2 crises of atrial flutter. 6 patients had a WPW syndrome and only 7 had an associated cardiac disease; the remaining had no other complaint but the arrhythmia. Verapamil, administered in the dose of 0.125-0.25 mg/Kg intravenously, interrupted critically the tachycardia in virtually all cases. The flutter was converted to atrial fibrillation with a slower ventricular rate. No adverse effects were observed but in two cases: one had a cardiac arrest promptly relieved and another a ventricular bradycardia corrected by atropine. Both cases had received an overdose of the drugs.
This study was planned to determine the protective role of zinc, if any, in attenuating the toxicity induced by nickel sulfate in rat liver. Female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats received either nickel alone in the dose of 800 mg/l in drinking water, zinc alone in the dose of 227 mg/l in drinking water, and nickel plus zinc or drinking water alone for a total duration of eight weeks. The effects of different treatments were studied on various parameters in rat liver which include antioxidant enzymes, levels of nickel and zinc and histoarchitecture at the light microscopic level. Further, the activities of hepatic marker enzymes AST and ALT were also studied in rat serum. Nickel treatment to the normal control animals, resulted in a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and enzyme activities of catalase and glutathione-S-transferase. On the contrary, nickel treatment to normal rats caused a significant inhibition in the levels of reduced glutathione. Superoxide dismutase activity was found to be decreased which however was not significant. Interestingly, when Zn was supplemented to nickel treated rats, the activities of catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase and the levels of GSH and lipid peroxidation came back to within normal limits. Activities of serum AST and ALT were increased significantly following nickel treatment to normal rats. Simultaneous zinc administration to nickel treated rats tended to restore the altered levels of AST and ALT. Normal control and zinc treated animals revealed normal histology of liver. On the other hand, nickel treated animals showed alterations in normal hepatic histoarchitecture which comprise of vacuolization of the hepatocytes and dilatation of sinusoids as well as increase in the number of bi-nucleated cells. Administration of zinc to nickel treated rats resulted in marked improvement in the structure of hepatocytes, thus emphasizing the protective potential of zinc in restoring the altered hepatic histoarchitecture. The nickel administration to normal rats indicated increased concentrations of nickel and decreased concentrations of zinc. However, zinc effectively brought the altered levels of nickel and zinc to within normal range. The study concludes that zinc has the potential in alleviating the toxic effects of nickel in rat liver because of its property to induce metallothionein (S-rich protein) as a free radical scavenger, or its indirect action in reducing the levels of oxygen reactive species.
Fifty psoriatic patients enrolled in a three week, double-blind, randomized, parallel study were treated either with amcinonide ointment 0.1 percent twice a day or fluocinonide ointment 0.05 percent three times a day. After Week 1 of treatment, no statistically significant differences appeared between the two groups with regard to improvement in signs and symptoms of psoriasis. After Week 3, improvement in all efficacy parameters, except erythema, and in Total Scores in both groups was greater than 50 percent as compared to baseline evaluations. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. Only one patient in each group reported an adverse experience that could have been drug-related. Amcinonide ointment used twice a day and fluocinonide ointment used three times a day were judged comparable with regard to safety and clinical efficacy. Amcinonide may be considered to have some advantage over fluocinonide because its twice a day treatment schedule makes it more convenient for patients to use.
Transcriptional silencing via promoter methylation of genes important for cell growth and differentiation plays a key role in myeloid leukemogenesis. We find that clinically achievable levels of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC), a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, can modify chromatin and restore the ability of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) to induce monocytic differentiation of the acute myeloid leukemia cells NB4 and U937. Although 5-AZA-dC cannot fully induce differentiation, we show that 5-AZA-dC acts directly on TNFalpha-responsive promoters to facilitate TNFalpha-induced transcriptional pathways leading to differentiation. 5-AZA-dC regulates the expression of Dif-2, a TNFalpha target gene, by deacetylating chromatin domains in a methylation-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of the Dif-2 promoter show histone hyperacetylation and a recruitment of the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription factor in response to 5-AZA-dC. Furthermore, 5-AZA-dC plus TNFalpha enhances the level of phosphorylated RNA Pol II at the Dif-2 promoter via synergistic recruitment of TFIIH. We conclude that nonspecific changes in chromatin can allow a specific transcriptional inducer to overcome blocks in leukemic cell differentiation. Our results support the concept of low doses of 5-AZA-dC acting in combination with other agents to target epigenetic changes that drive malignant growth in leukemic cells.

In 97 outpatients undergoing ambulatory arthroscopic procedures, we compared esmolol with alfentanil when used to supplement propofol-N2O-atracurium anesthesia according to a randomized, double-blind protocol. After an initial intravenous dose of 16 micrograms/kg alfentanil, or 2 mg/kg of esmolol, a variable-rate infusion of alfentanil or esmolol was administered to maintain a stable heart rate. After induction of anesthesia with 2.5 mg/kg of propofol, mean arterial pressure decreased to a larger extent in the alfentanil-treated patients. Although heart rate and mean arterial pressure increased in both groups after tracheal intubation, alfentanil more effectively blunted the hemodynamic response to this stimulus. Maintenance of anesthesia was adequate in both treatment groups. After discontinuation of anesthesia, patients in the esmolol group opened their eyes earlier (7.2 +/- 2.4 min vs 9.8 +/- 4.6 min) than those in the alfentanil group. Esmolol-treated patients also reported less sedation in the first 15 min of recovery than those receiving alfentanil. However, there were no differences in times to ambulation and discharge between the groups. Esmolol-treated patients reported more postoperative pain for the first 15 min of recovery and more esmolol-treated patients required postoperative opioid analgesia than those treated with alfentanil. There were no significant differences in the incidences of nausea and vomiting between the two groups. The authors conclude that esmolol may be used in place of alfentanil to supplement propofol-N2O-atracurium anesthesia in outpatients undergoing arthroscopic procedures. However, hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation were larger with esmolol, and avoidance of alfentanil did not decrease the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in this outpatient population.
