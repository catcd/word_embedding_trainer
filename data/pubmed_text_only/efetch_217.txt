Alcohol use is common and consumption during pregnancy has been shown to lead to a myriad of physical and neurologic abnormalities commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Substance addiction, which includes alcohol, has been shown to involve the major nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit CHRNA5. Using human embryonic stem cells as a model of early human development, we show that low concentrations of ethanol (20mM) can alter the expression of CHRNA5. Changes in CHRNA5 expression is linked to altered GABA and NMDA receptor expression, as well as abnormal development of the frontal cortex. These results suggest that alcohol exposure can alter early neurologic development, which may favor addiction and other developmental abnormalities in unborn children.
A case of an encephalomyelitis in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is reported. The patient was a 5-year-old boy who developed seizures, progressive confusion, and coma after radiation and intrathecal methotrexate therapy. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed bilateral hypodensities in the posterior parietal and temporal regions. At autopsy, perivascular inflammation, microglial nodules without intranuclear viral inclusions, and bilateral necrosis of the temporoparietal and hippocampal regions were seen in the brain and spinal cord. Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis is generally recognized in adult patients with underlying malignancy but, to our knowledge, has not been reported in children with leukemia. This report should alert the clinicians to an entity that must be included in the differential diagnosis of leukemic children with progressive neurologic disorder.
An attempt has been made to develop a chronic inflammatory arachnoiditis model in the rat to study the influence of subarachnoid or epidural steroids. Through chronically implanted catheters in Wistar rats (250-350 g), either triamcinolone (3.5-350 micrograms) or methylprednisolone (3.5-350 micrograms) was injected intrathecally, daily for 7 days or weekly for 7 weeks. Some rats also received 100 mg kg-1 cefoxitin and 0.5 mg deoxycortone by intramuscular injection. Equivalent control groups were included. High doses of intrathecal steroids caused marked weight loss and infection and many rats died. These effects were mitigated at a lower dosage especially by the addition of cefoxitin and deoxycortone. The effects of triamcinolone were more marked than those of methylprednisolone. No systematic histological evidence of neurotoxicity was observed after either steroid. Injections of talc failed to cause arachnoiditis or meningitis probably because sufficient particulate talc could not be injected through the narrow catheter.
The multistage model of colon carcinogenesis is well established in both humans and experimental animals, and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are generally assumed to be putative preneoplastic lesions of the colon. However, morphological analyses of ACF have suggested that they are highly heterogeneous in nature and their role in tumorigenesis is still controversial. To better understand the biological significance of ACF in carcinogenesis, morphological and genetic analyses were performed using a rat colon cancer model induced by a food-borne colon carcinogen, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). ACF of different sizes were collected at weeks 6, 18, 25, and 32 after three cycles of 2-week PhIP feeding (400 ppm in diet) with 4-week intervals on a high-fat diet, and a total of 110 ACF, representing approximately three-quarters of the total ACF, were subjected to histological evaluation. Thirty (27%) were diagnosed as dysplastic ACF, based on cytological and structural abnormalities of crypts. Dysplastic ACF were detected even at week 6 (0.4 per rat), and the numbers increased slightly at later time points, being 0.8, 1.4, and 0.8 per rat at weeks 18, 25, and 32, respectively. The sizes of these dysplastic ACF varied widely from 1 to 16 crypts and 50% (15 of 30) were composed of less than 4 crypts. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 83% (25 of 30) of dysplastic ACF demonstrated beta-catenin accumulation; 22 only in the cytoplasm and 3 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, the latter manifesting a higher grade of dysplasia as compared with the former. Seven dysplastic ACF harbored beta-catenin mutations at codon 32, 34, or 36 in exon 2, and one had an Apc mutation at the boundary of intron 10 and exon 11. Mutations at these sites were also commonly found in colon tumors induced by PhIP. The results of our present study indicate that dysplastic ACF, which accounted for approximately one-fourth of the total ACF, are preneoplastic lesions of colon cancers induced by PhIP in rats.
Recent research has shown that the tetracycline antibiotics are pluripotent drugs that inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and affect many cellular functions including proliferation, migration, and matrix remodeling. We have shown that doxycycline inhibits MMP activity and intimal thickening after injury of the rat carotid artery, however we do not know whether these effects are because of the antibiotic, anti-MMP, or other actions of doxycycline. Recently, chemically modified tetracyclines have been synthesized that lack antibiotic activity but retain anti-MMP activity (CMT-3), or lack both antibiotic and anti-MMP activity (CMT-5). In the current study we have assessed the effects of treatment with CMT-3 or CMT-5 on intimal thickening after balloon catheter injury of the rat carotid artery. Rats were treated by oral gavage with 15 mg/kg/day CMT-3 or CMT-5. CMT-3 significantly reduced smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in both the medial and intimal layers of the injured rat carotid artery compared to CMT-5. Furthermore, CMT-3 inhibited SMC migration from the media to the intima by 86% at 4 days after injury. CMT-3 also decreased MMP-2 activity. Finally, we found that CMT-3 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in intimal cross-sectional area from 0.23 +/- 0.01 mm(2) in the CMT-5 control group to 0.19 +/- 0.01 mm(2). There was also a reduction in elastin and collagen accumulation within the intima. We conclude that CMT-3 attenuated intimal thickening after arterial injury by inhibiting SMC proliferation, migration and MMP activity, and accumulation of extracellular matrix. The inhibitory effects of CMT-3 were independent of the antibiotic properties, but were dependent on the anti-MMP activity of the tetracycline family.
The aim of this study was to assess copper metabolism of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging using copper (II)-64 chloride ((64)CuCl(2)) as a tracer.
PET imaging of athymic mice (n = 5) bearing extrahepatic HCC xenografts was performed 24 hours after the intravenous injection of (64)CuCl(2), followed by ex vivo tissue radioactivity assay. Expression of human copper transporter 1 (hCTR1) in HCC cells and tissues was examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively.
The extrahepatic HCC xenografts in mice with increased uptake of (64)Cu radionuclide were visualized on the micro-PET images obtained 24 hours after the intravenous injection of (64)CuCl(2). PET quantitative analysis revealed increased (64)Cu radioactivity in tumor tissues (2.7 ± 0.6 %ID/g) compared to that in the soft tissue of the left shoulder opposite to the tumor site (0.6 ± 0.2 %ID/g) and the brain (0.7 ± 0.1 %ID/g) but lower than that of the liver (16.6 ± 1.3 %ID/g). Expression of hCTR1 in the HCC cells and xenograft tumor tissues was demonstrated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively. The expression level of hCTR1 in the Hep3B HCC xenograft tissues was lower than that detected in the normal hepatic tissues and the tissue samples of well-differentiated primary HCC. Variable expression of hCTR1 was detected in the tissue samples of moderately differentiated primary HCC.
Extrahepatic human HCC xenografts in mice could be localized with (64)CuCl(2) PET imaging, which might be useful for the localization and quantitative assessment of copper metabolism in extrahepatic metastases of HCC in humans.
The two-stage skin carcinogenesis model of initiation and promotion in SENCAR mice has been used to examine the effects of various tumor-promoting agents on the expression of the Ha-ras oncogene in early stages of tumorigenesis in vivo. Papillomas were induced in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated SENCAR mouse epidermis by (i) complete promotion with benzoyl peroxide; (ii) complete promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA); and (iii) two-stage promotion with TPA for 2 weeks followed by mezerein for 9 weeks. Results of Northern blot hybridization analyses show that early papillomas contain significantly elevated levels of Ha-ras polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNA, irrespective of the type of tumor promotion regimen used. This pattern holds for promoters of the phorbol ester class as well as for the free radical generating agent benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, digestion of tumor DNA with diagnostic restriction endonucleases demonstrated that 9-week-old papillomas induced by DMBA contained a point mutation in the 61st codon of one allele of the Ha-ras gene. The results represent the earliest stage in the development of a papilloma at which a Ha-ras point mutation has been reported.
Recent epidemiological reports showed that smoking has a negative impact on renal function and elevates the renal risk not only in the renal patient but perhaps also in the healthy population. Studies suggested that nicotine, a major tobacco alkaloid, links smoking to renal dysfunction. While several studies showed that smoking/chronic nicotine exposure exacerbates the progression of chronic renal diseases, its impact on acute kidney injury is virtually unknown. Here, we studied the effects of chronic nicotine exposure on acute renal ischemic injury. We found that chronic nicotine exposure increased the extent of renal injury induced by warm ischemia-reperfusion as evidenced by morphological changes, increase in plasma creatinine level, and kidney injury molecule-1 expression. We also found that chronic nicotine exposure elevated markers of oxidative stress such as nitrotyrosine as well as malondialdehyde. Interestingly, chronic nicotine exposure alone increased oxidative stress and injury in the kidney without morphological alterations. Chronic nicotine treatment not only increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and injury but also exacerbated oxidative stress-induced ROS generation through NADPH oxidase and mitochondria in cultured renal proximal tubule cells. The resultant oxidative stress provoked injury through JNK-mediated activation of the activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factor in vitro. This mechanism might exist in vivo as phosphorylation of JNK and its downstream target c-jun, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, is elevated in the ischemic kidneys exposed to chronic nicotine. Our results imply that smoking may sensitize the kidney to ischemic insults and perhaps facilitates progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidney injury.
The effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptor antagonists on scopolamine-induced amnesia and on delay-interposed short-term memory performance were investigated using an 8-arm radial maze in rats. Scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist, deteriorated the radial maze performance, while MK-801, an NMDA receptor channel blocker and CGS-19755, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, showed no obstruction to the spatial cognition in the non-delayed maze task. MK-801 (0.01-0.03 mg/kg, i.v.) and CGS-19755 (1-10 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly augmented scopolamine-induced deficit in the non-delayed maze task and impaired the short-term memory in the 5-min delay-interposed task. These results suggest that NMDA antagonists have a negative action on short-term memory and that the interaction between the NMDA and the central muscarinic system plays a role in modulating the cognitive function.
The mucocutaneous side-effects of systemic retinoids are well known. We report a patient with diffuse oedema, which is a very rare side-effect of retinoids. The pathophysiology of this condition is poorly known because of the rarity of relevant observations, but apparently corresponds to capillary leak syndrome. The outcome is invariably favourable following withdrawal of the drug, which should be definitively contraindicated in the patient.
MCP-1/CCL2 plays a critical role in monocyte recruitment into sites of immune responses and cancer. However, the role of other MCPs remains unclear. In this study, we generated a novel MCP-1-deficient (designated as MCP-1(Delta/Delta)) mouse model by deleting a 2.3-kb DNA fragment from the mouse genome using the Cre/loxP system. MCP-1 was not produced by LPS-activated MCP-1(Delta/Delta) macrophages; however, the production of MCP-3, coded by the immediate downstream gene, was significantly increased. In contrast, macrophages from another mouse line with a neo-gene cassette in intron 2 produced a significantly lower level of MCP-1 and MCP-3. Decreased MCP-3 production was also detected in previously generated MCP-1-deficient mice in which a neo-gene cassette was inserted in exon 2 (designated as MCP-1 knockout (KO)). Altered MCP-1 and/or MCP-3 production was also observed in vivo in each mouse model in response to i.p. injection of thioglycolate or zymosan. The up- and down-regulation of MCP-3 production in MCP-1(Delta/Delta) and MCP-1 KO mice, respectively, provided us with a unique opportunity to evaluate the role for MCP-3. Despite the increased MCP-3 production in MCP-1(Delta/Delta) mice, thioglycolate- or zymosan-induced monocyte/macrophage accumulation was still reduced by approximately 50% compared with wild-type mice, similar to the reduction detected in MCP-1 KO mice. Thus, up-regulated MCP-3 production did not compensate for the loss of MCP-1, and MCP-3 appears to be a less effective mediator of monocyte recruitment than MCP-1. Our results also indicate the presence of other mediators regulating the recruitment of monocytes in these models.
Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been reported to have a higher bleeding rate than conventional methods. However, there are few reports on whether a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine2-receptor antagonist is the more effective treatment for preventing bleeding after ESD. In a prospective trial, patients undergoing ESD due to gastric adenoma or adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to pantoprazole or famotidine. Both drugs were given intravenously for the first 2 days, thereafter by mouth. Eighty-five in the pantoprazole group and 79 in the famotidine group were included for analysis. Primary outcome measure was the delayed bleeding rate. Clinical characteristics were not different between the two groups. The delayed bleeding rate was significantly lower in the pantoprazole group compared with the famotidine group (3.5% vs. 12.7%, p=0.031). On multivariate analysis, the preventive use of pantoprazole (relative hazard: 0.220, 95% CI: 0.051- 0.827, p=0.026) and the specimen size (> or =34 mm, relative hazard: 4.178, 95% CI: 1.229-14.197, p=0.022) were two independent factors predictive of delayed bleeding. There were no significant differences in en bloc and complete resection rate between the two groups. In conclusion, pantoprazole is more effective than famotidine for the prevention of delayed bleeding after ESD.
Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that alpha-methyldopa, a potent inhibitor of catecholamine synthesis, reduced both libido and erectile function in sexually mature male rats as it does in humans. In this report, those studies were extended to identify the drug's effect upon catecholamine content in the brain, spinal cord and penile erectile tissue in mature male rats. Because many men report that the adverse effects of alpha-methyldopa upon their sexual performance continue after withdrawal from the drug, a 2nd group of animals was retested after the drug was stopped. Results of the group I study showed diminished copulatory and erectile activity as well as penile and brain norepinephrine content. In the group II rats there was a continued significant reduction in erectile and copulatory activity. At the same time, brain, spinal cord and penile tissue content of norepinephrine returned to normal levels. In another experiment an alpha 2-receptor antagonist was administered with alpha-methyldopa and no inhibition of the effects of alpha-methyldopa was observed. These findings imply that the effect of alpha-methyldopa on sexual function is mediated in the central nervous system as an abnormality of receptor function.
Testosterone (T) administration is associated with increased satellite cell number and skeletal muscle hypertrophy, although there is considerable heterogeneity in the response of different skeletal muscle groups to T in vivo. We investigated the effects of T on the growth and differentiation of satellite cells isolated from levator ani (LA) and gastrocnemius (gastroc) muscles. T up regulated follistatin (Fst) expression, but down regulated the mRNA and protein expression of a number of genes in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-signaling pathway. Inhibition of Fst expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited myogenic differentiation and blocked the pro-myogenic effects of T. Treatment of satellite cells with T or Fst up regulated the expression of Pax7 and PCNA, and increased their proliferation. T and Fst blocked TGF-β induced inhibition of growth and myogenic differentiation and down regulated TGF-β-dependent transcriptome in both LA and gastroc cells. We conclude that T stimulation of satellite cell proliferation and myogenic differentiation are associated with up regulation of Fst and inhibition of TGF-β-signaling.
Mitochondria are involved in many cellular processes; mitochondrial dysfunctions have been associated with apoptosis, aging, and a number of pathological conditions, including osteoarthritis (OA). Mitochondrial proteins are attractive targets for the study of metabolism of the chondrocyte, the unique cell type present in mature cartilage, and its role in tissue degradation. Using a proteomics approach based on two-dimensional DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometric identification of mitochondria- enriched protein fractions from human articular chondrocytes, we analyzed mitochondrial protein changes that are characteristic of OA chondrocytes. A total of 73 protein forms were unambiguously identified as significantly altered in OA; 23 of them have been previously described as mitochondrial. An extensive statistical and cluster analysis of the data revealed a mitochondrial protein profile characteristic for OA. This pattern includes alterations in energy production, maintenance of mitochondrial membrane integrity, and free radical detoxification. Real time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistofluorescence assays confirmed a significant decrease of the major mitochondrial antioxidant protein manganese-superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in the superficial layer of OA cartilage. As possible outputs for this antioxidant deficiency, we found an increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in OA chondrocytes and also verified an OA-dependent increase in the mitochondrial tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a chaperone with a reported reactive oxygen species antagonist role. Our results describe the differences between the mitochondrial protein profiles of normal and OA chondrocytes, demonstrating that mitochondrial dysregulation occurs in cartilage cells during OA and highlighting redox imbalance as a key factor in OA pathogenesis.
Cidofovir has antiviral activity against a wide spectrum of DNA viruses. Several small studies have focused on the efficacy of topical cidofovir in various viral-induced diseases. We report a systemic complication of such therapy.
A bone marrow transplant recipient with chronic renal failure developed genital condylomas resistant to standard therapy. After topical cidofovir application (1% once daily for 5 days, then 4% for 12 days), the lesions improved while local erosions appeared. Acute renal failure with features of tubular acidosis occurred at day 19. Spontaneous recovery was observed after cidofovir withdrawal.
We describe for the first time acute renal failure after topical cidofovir in an immunosuppressed patient with prior renal insufficiency. This method of administration should be avoided on abraded skin and should be carefully monitored.
The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity. Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration. Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure. This was accompanied by a lower activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems. Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration. These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.
The efficacy and safety of chlormadinone acetate (CA) versus micronized progesterone (P) were assessed in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women.
This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel group study with a 6-month double-blind period followed by a 12-month open period. Patients were randomized to receive every month during 18 months percutaneous 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) 1.5 mg/day from Day 1 to 24 of treatment cycle, combined from Day 11 to 24 to either CA 10 mg/day (n=167) or P 200 mg/day (n=169). Endometrial biopsy (EB, main analysis criterion) was performed at baseline, and at Day 18-24 of the 6th and 18th cycles.
At Month 6, EB did not evidence any hyperplasia. EB were inadequate for assessment in 24.5% and 47.5% of patients in the CA and MP groups, respectively. CA was found to be as protective as P (96.3% and 92.0% of success). However, the hormonal status of the endometrium differed (P<0.001): a secretory endometrium was found in 81.5% of the CA patients, compared to 50.7% in the P group. These transformations resulted in predictable, cyclic bleeding in 94.5% of the CA patients, compared to only 62.3% of the P patients (P=0.0001). Unscheduled bleeding, spotting and/or metrorrhagia, were more frequent under P than under CA (17.9% and 13.7%, respectively). The beneficial effects on hot flushes were more important in the CA group than in the P (P<0.001). At Month 18, the biopsy and clinical results were similar to those obtained at Month 6. The safety profile, particularly the lipid one, was similar in both groups, except for drowsiness and dizziness, which were significantly more frequent under P than under CA.
The progestative effects of CA on the endometrium and on menopause-related symptoms were at least as good as those of P. Moreover, CA resulted more often than P in secretory effects, and in satisfying bleeding patterns.
Lithium-induced glomerular toxicity is an infrequent occurrence in pediatric patients. We report a 13-year-old patient presenting with clinical and laboratory evidence of renal insufficiency after long-term lithium use. Biopsy revealed membranous glomerulonephropathy. Discontinuation of the lithium treatment resulted in resolution of the symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Other alkali metals have been implicated as risk factors for membranous glomerulonephropathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of lithium-induced glomerulonephropathy in a pediatric patient.
The association between in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) and clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) of the vagina and cervix is well known, yet there has been no systematic study of DES-exposed daughters to determine whether they have an increased risk of other cancers. As many as 3 million women in the United States may have been exposed to DES in utero.
To determine whether women exposed to DES in utero have a higher risk of cancer after an average of 16 years of follow-up.
A cohort study with mailed questionnaires and medical record review of reported cancer outcomes.
A cohort of 4536 DES-exposed daughters (of whom 81% responded) and 1544 unexposed daughters (of whom 79% responded) who were first identified in the mid-1970s.
Cancer incidence in DES-exposed daughters compared with population-based rates and compared with cancer incidence in unexposed daughters.
To date, DES-exposed daughters have not experienced an increased risk for all cancers (rate ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.56) or for individual cancer sites, except for CCA. Three cases of vaginal CCA occurred among the exposed daughters, resulting in a standardized incidence ratio of 40.7 (95% CI, 13.1-126.2) in comparison with population-based incidence rates. The rate ratio for breast cancer was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.56-2.49); adjustment for known risk factors did not alter this result.
Thus far, DES-exposed daughters show no increased cancer risk, except for CCA. Nevertheless, because exposed daughters included in our study were, on average, only 38 years old at last follow-up, continued surveillance is warranted to determine whether any increases in cancer risk occur during the menopausal years.
In an open-controlled, randomized trial over 24 weeks, the serum uric acid lowering effect of a daily dose of 100 mg allopurinol in combination with 20 mg benzbromarone compared to 300 mg allopurinol only was investigated on a total of 60 patients suffering from hyperuricemia. Both preparations led to a decrease of the serum uric acid value to normal. In those patients however, who had received the combination the reduction of the serum uric acid level was more pronounced. Tolerance was generally good. Side-effects were not reported.
