While most studies have demonstrated damage to the cochlear and vestibular endorgan as the primary site of aminoglycoside toxicity, the effect on the primary afferent neurons of the vestibular ganglion remains to be determined. This study used the unbiased stereology-optical fractionator method to obtain estimates of the vestibular ganglion neuronal number. Archival temporal bone specimens from seven subjects with a history of gentamicin (n=3) and streptomycin (n=4) aminoglycoside ototoxicity were used. The post-ototoxicity survival time ranged from two months to 8 years, with an average of 2.2 years. Seven archival human temporal bone specimens from age-matched subjects with no history of audiovestibular symptoms or ototoxicity served as controls. Group means were compared using unpaired, two-tailed student's t test. The average vestibular ganglion neuronal number in the aminoglycoside ototoxicity group was 20, 733 neurons (CV=0.073), which was significantly lower (p<0.005) than the average number in the age-matched control group of 24, 902 neurons (CV=0.109). These findings may be consistent with either retrograde degeneration or a direct neurotoxic effect of the aminoglycosides on the vestibular ganglion neuron.
Stupor is an unusual complication following the addition of valproic acid to other antiepileptic drugs. We report four such cases. Stupor occurred acutely in 3 patients and insidiously in the fourth. In the cases of acute toxicity, neither toxic levels of valproate nor significant elevations in blood levels of the other drugs occurred. In the fourth patient, stupor occurred concomitantly with a rise in the phenobarbital level. The electroencephalograms of all 4 patients revealed generalized high-amplitude rhythmic bisynchronous delta activity. Recovery occurred following discontinuation of valproic acid or other antiepileptic drugs. These observations suggest that stupor may occur as a result of drug interactions after the addition of valproic acid to other antiepileptic drugs.
To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens.
The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods.
The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5×6×12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm).
It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6 and CYP2E1 are enzymes with a high ability to activate a nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), to its potent and ultimate carcinogens. The polymorphic CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 have been implicated in increased susceptibility to certain malignancies. In our study, 120 Japanese patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and 158 healthy controls were compared for frequencies of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 genotypes. The frequency with which the subjects carried homozygotes of the CYP2A6 gene deletion allele, which causes lack of the enzyme activity, was significantly higher in the gastric cancer patients than in the healthy control subjects (OR = 3.14, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.05-9.41). Subdividing gastric adenocarcinoma according to tumor differentiation, patients with the well-differentiated type were 4.9-fold more likely to have the CYP2A6 homozygote deletion genotype (OR = 4.91, 95% CI 1.17-20.52). Stratifying by smoking status, we did not find the risk of CYP2A6 gene deletion allele in gastric adenocarcinoma. The CYP2E1 polymorphism detected by RsaI was not significantly different between gastric adenocarcinoma patients (40.8%) and the control population (44.3%). No statistically significant changes were observed when the CYP2E1 genotype was examined relative to tumor differentiation and smoking status. These results suggest that the CTY2A6 deletion is associated with gastric adenocarcinoma among Japanese populations.
A double-blind cross over study on the effect of 3 months' treatment with 1% topical minoxidil on 23 individuals with alopecia areata was performed. Thirteen of the patients showed some increase in terminal hair growth, the difference between the number of responders to placebo and minoxidil lotion being significant (p less than 0.005). However, in one case only, the result was cosmetically satisfying. In two male patients the blood pressure increased coinciding with the withdrawal of the minoxidil lotion.
We examine the possible evidence that the phytochemical curcumin may overcome resistance to hormonal and cytotoxic agents in breast cancer. We present our observations on MCF-7R, a multidrug-resistant (MDR) variant of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. In contrast to MCF-7, MCF-7R lacks aromatase and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and overexpresses the multidrug transporter ABCB1 and the products of different genes implicated in cell proliferation and survival, like c-IAP-1, NAIP, survivin, and COX-2. Nevertheless, in cytotoxicity and cell death induction assays, we found that the antitumor activity of curcumin is substantial both in MCF-7 and in MCF-7R. We elaborated the diketone system of curcumin into different analogues; the benzyloxime and the isoxazole and pyrazole heterocycles showed remarkable increases in the antitumor potency both in the parental and in the MDR MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, curcumin or, more potently, the isoxazole analogue, produced early reductions in the amounts of relevant gene transcripts that were diverse (i.e., they were relative to Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) in MCF-7 and the inhibitory of apoptosis proteins and COX-2 in MCF-7R) in the two cell lines. Thus, the two compounds exhibited the remarkable property of being able to modify their molecular activities according to the distinct characteristics of the parental and MDR cells. We discuss also how curcumin may (1) exert antitumor effects in breast cancer through ER-dependent and ER-independent mechanisms; and (2) act as a drug transporter-mediated MDR reversal agent. Overall, the structure of curcumin may represent the basis for the development of new, effective anticancer agents in hormone-independent MDR breast cancer.
Plasma concentrations of neuroactive steroids in men with panic disorder (PD) were measured to evaluate their relations to psychopathology both before and during treatment. Participants comprised 13 men with PD and 10 normal controls. Patients were evaluated while drug-free as well as after 1 and 2 months of paroxetine therapy. Psychopathology was assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Panic-Associated Symptom Scale, and the Fear Questionnaire total score. Plasma concentrations of steroids were measured by radioimmunoassay. The plasma concentrations of progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone were greater in drug-free patients than in controls, whereas those of allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone did not differ between the two groups. Paroxetine treatment for 2 months significantly increased the plasma concentration of allopregnanolone but did not affect those of the other steroids. At 2 months of therapy, allopregnanolone concentrations in patients were significantly greater than those in controls. The plasma concentrations of progesterone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone correlated with the STAI state score in patients before treatment. Our data suggest that neuroactive steroids may play a role in PD in men.
This study aimed to study the role of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the pulmonary hypertension induced by interaction of heparin-protamine in anesthetized dogs. The effect of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) was also investigated in this model. Dogs were anesthetized and instrumented for acquisition of mean arterial blood pressure, mean arterial pulmonary pressure (MPAP), and pulmonary pressure gradient (PPG). Cardiac index (CI), heart rate, and index of systemic vascular resistance were also obtained. Intravenous administration of heparin (500 IU/kg) 3 minutes before protamine (10 mg/kg) caused marked pulmonary hypertension, as evaluated by the increase in MPAP and PPG. This was accompanied by systemic hypotension, CI decrease, and tachycardia. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg), dazoxiben (10 mg/kg), or tezosentan (10-mg/kg bolus plus 10-mg/kg/h infusion) significantly reduced the increase in MPAP and PPG, but had no effect on the systemic hypotension. Similar results were obtained with inhaled NO (3 ppm). Plasma TXB2 levels were markedly elevated during the pulmonary hypertension, and this was abolished in indomethacin-treated dogs. Our study shows that interaction of heparin-protamine in anesthetized dogs lead to TXA2- and ET-1-mediated pulmonary hypertension. Drugs that interfere with the synthesis of these mediators as well as inhaled NO may be of beneficial value to control this disorder.
High-dose methamphetamine treatment induces long-term deficits in central monoamine systems. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. Previous work has shown that the Kappa-opioid receptor agonist U-69593 [(+)-(5alpha,7alpha,8b)-(+)-N-methyl-N[7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl] benzeneacetamide] attenuates the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine on extracellular dopamine levels in mice, suggesting that endogenous Kappa-opioid receptor ligands, such as dynorphin, may protect against methamphetamine-induced toxicity and play a role in mediating the long-term consequences of methamphetamine. To further examine the role that dynorphin systems play in methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity, we administered to male rats a total of four injections of methamphetamine (7.5 mg/kg, s.c.), with a 2-h interval between each dose. Rats were pretreated with either the Kappa-agonist U-69593 (0.32 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle, 15 min prior to the first and third methamphetamine injection. Furthermore, cages containing the U-69593 + methamphetamine-treated rats were placed on heating pads for 30 min after the first U-69593 injection to prevent the drug from blocking methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia. Rats were sacrificed 7 days after treatment. Striatal dopamine and serotonin contents were decreased approximately 75% and 55%, respectively, in the methamphetamine-treated rats and approximately 88% and 65%, respectively, in rats receiving the U-69593 + methamphetamine combination. There was a approximately 20% mortality rate in the rats treated with methamphetamine compared to approximately 75% mortality rate in rats treated with both U-69593 and methamphetamine. A similar rate of mortality was observed when combining a different Kappa-agonist, U-50488 [trans-(-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamine], with methamphetamine. These data suggest that Kappa-agonists do not protect against methamphetamine-induced toxicity to monoamines in rats, and may potentiate mortality when co-administered with methamphetamine.
It is generally held that the elderly are more sensitive to motor side effects of antipsychotics, although the mechanisms for such an effect are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to examine whether this sensitivity is due to a central pharmacokinetic (i.e., higher occupancy for a given plasma level) or pharmacodynamic (i.e., greater functional effects for a given occupancy) effect.

Thirteen subjects aged 50 (mean +/- standard deviation age: 62 +/- 9 years) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were receiving risperidone.
Dopamine D2 binding potential in the striatum, using [C]raclopride positron emission tomography scan. D2 receptor occupancy was calculated, using age-corrected measure from healthy individuals and region of interest analysis.
The authors observed the expected nonlinear relationship between total risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone plasma level and striatal D2 receptor occupancy. The estimated plasma level of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone associated with 50% maximal receptor occupancy was 7.3 ng/mL, which is similar to what has been reported in younger patients. However, extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) were observed in seven subjects at D2 occupancy of 34%-79%, occupancy levels that are lower than previously reported for younger patients in whom EPS are rare at occupancies lower than 80%.
The observation of greater functional effect (EPS in this case) for a given drug occupancy than the younger patients supports a pharmacodynamic mechanism for age-related antipsychotic drug sensitivity. This finding has important implications for dosing of antipsychotics in older patients with schizophrenia.
To examine whether Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, a mutant rat model of Wilson's disease, have a susceptibility gene(s) to hepatocarcinogenesis in addition to the causative gene, Atp7b, we established a new congenic strain, WKAH.C-Atp7b rats, in which the Atp7b gene of the LEC rats is inserted into the normal Wistar-King Aptekman Hokkaido (WKAH) background. Hepatocellular tumors developed spontaneously in both sexes of WKAH.C-Atp7b rats, their incidence being slightly lower than that in LEC rats. Incidences of spontaneous liver tumors in LEC, WKAH.C-Atp7b and WKAH rats correlated with hepatic copper and iron concentrations. Medium-term liver bioassay showed that LEC rats were more susceptible to the induction of glutathione S-transferase placental form-positive preneoplastic foci than WKAH.C-Atp7b rats, and WKAH.C-Atp7b rats were more susceptible than WKAH rats. In an N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced long-term carcinogenicity study, 1) LEC rats were similarly or rather less susceptible to hepatocellular tumors than WKAH.C-Atp7b and WKAH rats, indicating that the progression of the preneoplastic foci to liver cancer in LEC rats was worse than that in WKAH.C-Atp7b and WKAH rats, 2) the incidences of kidney tumors in LEC and WKAH.C-Atp7b rats were higher than that in WKAH rats and high copper concentrations in the kidneys were observed in LEC and WKAH.C-Atp7b rats, 3) LEC rats were resistant to lung carcinogenesis. These data indicate that the susceptibility of LEC rats to liver and kidney carcinogenesis could be explained by Atp7b gene mutation and that the susceptibility to lung carcinogenesis is controlled by gene(s) other than Atp7b.
Genetic inactivation of ClC-5, a voltage-gated chloride channel prominently expressed in the kidney, leads to proteinuria because of defective apical endocytosis in proximal tubular cells. Because thyroid hormone secretion depends on apical endocytosis of thyroglobulin (Tg), we investigated whether ClC-5 is expressed in the thyroid and affects its function, using Clcn5-deficient knockout (KO) mice. We found that ClC-5 is highly expressed in wild-type mouse thyroid ( approximately 40% of mRNA kidney level). The protein was immunolocalized at the apical pole of thyrocytes. In Percoll gradients, ClC-5 overlapped with plasma membrane and early endosome markers, but best codistributed with the late endosomal marker, Rab7. ClC-5 KO mice were euthyroid (normal T4 and TSH serum levels) but developed a goiter with parallel iodine and Tg accumulation (i.e. normal Tg iodination level). When comparing ClC-5 KO with wild-type mice, thyroid 125I uptake after 1 h was doubled, incorporation into Tg was decreased by approximately 2-fold, so that trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I increased approximately 4-fold. Enhanced 125I- efflux upon perchlorate and presence of 125I-Tg as autoradiographic rings at follicle periphery demonstrated delayed iodide organification. Endocytic trafficking of 125I-Tg toward lysosomes was not inhibited. Expression of pendrin, an I-/Cl- exchanger involved in apical iodide efflux, was selectively decreased by 60% in KO mice at mRNA and protein levels. Thus, ClC-5 is well expressed in the thyroid but is not critical for apical endocytosis, contrary to the kidney. Instead, the goiter associated with ClC-5 KO results from impaired rate of apical iodide efflux by down-regulation of pendrin expression.
We describe a 58-year-old patient with relapsing high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who exhibited exacerbation of posthypoxic action myoclonus during high-dose intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) treatment for highly suspicious Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). Three months previously the patient had experienced a hypoxic insult caused by respiratory arrest due to an anaphylactic reaction to antibiotic therapy. He had developed posthypoxic action myoclonus (Lance-Adams syndrome), which was well controlled by oral treatment with piracetam. However, after TMP-SMX therapy (115 mg/kg daily) was started for suspicion of newly developed PCP, posthypoxic action myoclonus worsened dramatically resulting in complete disability. Anti-myoclonic therapy with increased doses of piracetam and valproic acid did not significantly improve his clinical condition. Only when TMPSMX doses were reduced (38 mg/kg daily) on day 12 did action myoclonus cease within 2 to 3 days. We suggest that TMP-SMX can exacerbate posthypoxic action myoclonus.
Tetracyclines have been used as in vivo indicators of new bone formation because they form complexes with mineral at bone-forming surfaces. Four of 12 dogs in a bone-labeling study developed clinical signs of renal disease (vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and azotemia) within 1 to 2 days of receiving oxytetracycline at a bone-labeling dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight, once daily for 2 consecutive days. To delineate the relationship between oxytetracycline administration and renal damage, six dogs were given the bone-labeling dose intravenously and were subsequently evaluated by determination of clinical signs, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis, and histologic examination (experiment 1). Drug administration was modified in the five dogs remaining in the bone-labeling orthopedic study. These dogs received the oxytetracycline dose as a slow intravenous infusion diluted with 250 ml of lactated Ringer's solution (experiment 2). All six dogs of experiment 1 developed persistent isosthenuria within 2 days of receiving the bone-labeling dose of oxytetracycline. Clinical illness (three of six dogs) was associated with azotemia, creatinemia, and hyperphosphatemia. All dogs had multifocal, mild to moderate flattening of renal tubular epithelium, characteristic of nephrosis. None of the dogs of experiment 2 developed any clinical indications of renal disease, and the only biochemical abnormality was isosthenuria in two of the five dogs. Thus the development of clinical signs and biochemical abnormalities associated with the intravenous administration of oxytetracycline was obviated by the slow administration of a dilution of the calculated bone-labeling dose of the antibiotic.
To evaluate the clinical outcomes of two different doses of BTX-A in patients with I-OAB.
This investigator initiated, randomized trial was designed to evaluate clinical differences in outcomes for 100 versus 150 U BTX-A in patients with I-OAB. Patients with OAB-Wet and OAB-Dry were randomized to receive 100 or 150 U BTX-A intra-detrusor injection. For patients with OAB-Wet, the primary outcome of interest was change in daily UUI episodes, and for those with OAB-Dry the primary outcome measure was change in number of daily voids as determined by 3-VD. Statistical comparisons were made both pre- and post-injection and also between different treatment groups to assess the superiority of one dose versus the other.
Forty-four patients enrolled in the study; 10 OAB-Dry and 12 OAB-Wet patients received 100 U and another 10 OAB-Dry and 12 OAB-Wet patients received 150 U. No significant differences in outcome measure were noted between those receiving 100 versus 150 U. Patients with OAB-Wet tended to be completely dry more frequently if they received the 150 U dose, but this was not statistically significant. No differences in urodynamics outcomes were noted between the groups. QOL was significantly improved in both groups with no difference between the different doses.
In patients with I-OAB, preliminary results indicate that 100 U BTX-A and 150 U BTX-A are equivalent in terms of symptom reduction and QOL improvement.
In the present study an investigation was made on the pharmacodynamic effect of the beta-blocking agent bupranolol in the low-dose range. Bupranolol is usually given in doses of 100 mg twice daily in the treatment of hypertension, however the dose range between 20 and 100 mg was studied using graded isoproterenol injections in healthy volunteers. A significant beta-1-blocking activity was observed for the 20 mg dose already. This effect was reduced after a treatment of 10 days. The effect increased with the higher doses, there might be a linear correlation between the logarithm of the dose and the reduction of the tachycardia after the isoproterenol injections in the low-dose range. It was concluded that using the safe and sensitive isoproterenol injection method, the clinical effect of very low doses of bupranolol may be demonstrated. The low dose might be useful to reduce the reflex tachycardia seen in the treatment of hypertension with vasodilating drugs.
Maternal convulsions and severe fetal bradycardia resulted from the accidental intravascular injection of 0.5% bupivacaine for epidural anesthesia in preparation for caesarean section. Ventilation with oxygen, application of anticonvulsive drugs, relaxation and intubation was promptly performed followed by immediate caesarean section. The newborn was depressed at birth, recovered quickly and showed no neurologic deficits neither in the immediate postnatal period nor in neurobehaviour tests at the age of three months.
Anthracyclines are essential for the treatment of the children with cancer. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the existing evidence of the frequency and risk factors of anthracycline-induced clinical heart failure (A-CHF) in children.
Medline was searched for articles reporting the frequency of A-CHF, published from 1966 to December 2000. Information about study features, risk factors and frequency were abstracted, and a validity score was given for each study. The potential predictive factors of A-CHF were analysed both within and across the studies.
The frequency of A-CHF in children was estimated in 30 studies described in 25 articles. All studies have serious methodological limitations. The frequency varied between 0% and 16%. In the analysis across the studies the type of anthracyclines and the maximal dose in 1 week explain a considerable part of the variation of the frequency of A-CHF.
Doxorubicin and a dose above 45 mg/m2 within 1 week seemed to increase the frequency of A-CHF. Well designed and executed studies are needed to accurately estimate the frequency of A-CHF and reliably assess the importance of potential risk factors.
Wilson disease (WD) is a severe hepato-neurologic disorder that affects primarily children and young adults. WD is caused by mutations in ATP7B and subsequent copper overload. However, copper levels alone do not predict severity of the disease. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial distribution of copper in hepatocytes may play an important role in WD pathology. High resolution synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence imaging in situ indicates that copper does not continuously accumulate in Atp7b(-/-) hepatocytes, but reaches a limit at 90-300 fmol. The lack of further accumulation is associated with the loss of copper transporter Ctr1 from the plasma membrane and the appearance of copper-loaded lymphocytes and extracellular copper deposits. The WD progression is characterized by changes in subcellular copper localization and transcriptome remodeling. The synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence imaging and mRNA profiling both point to the key role of nucleus in the initial response to copper overload and suggest time-dependent sequestration of copper in deposits as a protective mechanism. The metabolic pathways, up-regulated in response to copper, show compartmentalization that parallels changes in subcellular copper concentration. In contrast, significant down-regulation of lipid metabolism is observed at all stages of WD irrespective of copper distribution. These observations suggest new stage-specific as well as general biomarkers for WD. The model for the dynamic role of copper in WD is proposed.
We assessed indoor air quality in photocopier centers and investigated whether occupational exposure to emissions from photocopiers is associated with decline in lung function or changes in haematological parameters, oxidative stress and inflammatory status.
Indoor air quality was monitored in five photocopier centers. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry in 81 photocopier operators (64 male and 17 female) and 43 healthy control (31 male and 12 female) subjects. Hematological status, serum thio-barbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total ferric reducing antioxidant capacity (FRAC), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 8-isoprostane, C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 8 (IL-8), clara cell protein (CC-16), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) were analyzed. Relationships between cumulative exposure, lung function and inflammatory markers were assessed.
PM10 and PM2.5 were above the permissible levels in all the photocopier centers, whereas the levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, sulphur dioxide, lead, arsenic, nickel, ammonia, benzene and benzo(a)pyrene were within Indian ambient air quality standards. Lung function was similar in the photocopier operators and control subjects. Serum TBARS was significantly higher and FRAC was lower among photocopier operators when compared to healthy controls. Plasma IL-8, LTB4, ICAM-1 and ECP were significantly higher in the photocopier exposed group.
Photocopiers emit high levels of particulate matter. Long term exposure to emissions from photocopiers was not associated with decreased lung function, but resulted in high oxidative stress and systemic inflammation leading to high risk of cardiovascular diseases.
A 68-year-old man with a history of previous myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease had an acute myocardial infarction 30 minutes after the injection of intravenous fluorescein for fundus angiography. The situational stress or phenylephrine dilating drops could have contributed to the complication.
Cooling the skin induces sympathetically driven vasoconstriction, with some vasoparalytic dilatation at the lowest temperatures. Neurogenic inflammation, on the other hand, entails vasodilatation. In this study we investigated the balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilatation in an area of experimentally induced secondary hyperalgesia (2 degrees HA), in response to low-temperature stimulations. Fourteen healthy volunteers were exposed to three 30-s long cold stimuli (20, 10, and 0 degrees C) applied, at three adjacent sites, before (baseline) and 8 min after intradermal injection of 50 microg capsaicin to the volar forearm. The cold stimuli were applied distally to the injection site within the 2 degrees HA. Blood flux (BF) and skin temperatures were measured at four different regions (proximally, and distally to the capsaicin injection and at the 0, 10, and 20 degrees C thermode sites) all within the 2 degrees HA. The vascular measurements were conducted five times. Results showed a marked increase in BF after baseline cold stimulation (P<0.001) at the 0 degrees C compared with the three other sites. In addition, vasodilatory effect (elevated BF) was found following the capsaicin injection compared with baseline for all regions (P<0.001): the non-cooled area was dilated by 450+/-5.1%; The vasoconstrictive effect for the 10 and 20 degrees C did not overcome the capsaicin vasodilatation, but did reduce it, with dilatation of 364+/-7.0% and 329+/-7.3%, respectively. For 0 degrees C, a dilatation of 407+/-6.5% was seen. It is concluded that in this experimental model, and potentially in the equivalent clinical syndromes, vasodilatation induced by the inflammation is only slightly reduced by cold stimulation such that it is still dominant, despite some cold-induced vasoconstriction.
