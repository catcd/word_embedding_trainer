Mannitol is widely used to reduce intracranial pressure and is protective against ischemic and nephrotoxic acute renal failure. However, the capacity of this seemingly innocuous agent to produce acute renal failure is not well recognized. We report herein the clinical course of 8 cases of mannitol-induced acute renal failure. In addition, we reviewed all previously reported cases of mannitol-induced renal failure. In the present series, acute oliguric renal failure developed within 3.5 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- SD) days after receiving daily and total mannitol doses of 189 +/- 64 g and 626 +/- 270 g, respectively, over 3.5 +/- 1.5 days. The peak serum creatinine was 5.7 +/- 2.7 mg/dl and peak osmolal gap was 74 +/- 39 mOsm/kg water. Renal tubular epithelial cells containing vacuoles were seen in the urinary sediments of 6 patients. Renal function improved rapidly upon discontinuation of mannitol and/or removal of mannitol by hemodialysis. In those previously reported cases in which the baseline renal function was normal, acute renal failure developed after receiving total mannitol doses of 1171 +/- 376 g. The peak osmolal gap was 107 +/- 17. In contrast, in those with underlying renal compromise, renal function worsened after a total mannitol dose of 295 +/- 143 g. The pathogenesis of mannitol-induced renal failure is not yet established but may be associated with renal vasoconstriction produced by high concentrations of mannitol. This may be averted in clinical practice by monitoring the osmolal gap, rather than serum osmolality alone, when using mannitol infusions for the treatment of intracranial hypertension.
We conducted the first US study to compare semen quality among study centres using standardized methods and strict quality control. We present data on semen quality in partners of 493 pregnant women recruited through prenatal clinics in four US cities during 1999-2001. Sperm concentration, semen volume and motility were determined at the centres and morphology was assessed at a central laboratory. While between-centre differences in sperm morphology and sample volume were small, sperm concentration and motility were significantly reduced in Columbia, MO (MO) relative to men in New York, NY, Minneapolis, MN and Los Angeles, CA; total number of motile sperm was 113 x 10(6) in MO and 162, 201 and 196 x 10(6) in CA, MN and NY respectively. Differences among centres remained significant in multivariate models that controlled for abstinence time, semen analysis time, age, race, smoking, history of sexually transmitted disease and recent fever (all p-values <0.01). We hypothesized that poorer sperm concentration and motility in MO men relative to other centres might be related to agricultural pesticides that are commonly used in the mid-west. We investigated this hypothesis by conducting a nested case-control study within the MO cohort. We selected 25 men in this cohort for whom all semen parameters (concentration, % normal morphology and % motile) were low as cases and an equal number of men for whom all semen parameters were within normal limits as controls. We measured metabolites of eight non-persistent, current-use pesticides in urine samples the men had provided at the time of semen collection. Pesticide metabolite levels were elevated in cases compared with controls for the herbicides alachlor and atrazine, and for the insecticide diazinon (2-isopropoxy-4-methyl-pyrimidinol) (p-values for Wilcoxon rank test = 0.0007, 0.012, and 0.0004 for alachlor, atrazine and diazinon respectively). Men with higher levels of alachlor or diazinon were significantly more likely to be cases than men with low levels [odds ratios (OR) = 30.0, 16.7 for alachlor and diazinon respectively], as were men with atrazine over the limit of detection (OR = 11.3). These associations between current-use pesticides and reduced semen quality suggest that agricultural chemicals may have contributed to the reduced semen quality seen in fertile men from mid-Missouri.
A single intravenous injection of adriamycin (5mg per kg.) into rats induced nephrosis. In the various periods of the model, alterations of glomerular anionic sites stained with colloidal iron were analyzed quantitatively by image analyzer for the first time at home and abroad. The results showed that there was a significant decrease in glomerular anionic charge sites at 3 hours after administration of adriamycin as compared with that of the control animals (P less than 0.01). Marked loss of the anionic charge sites preceded the onset of proteinuria and was steadily increasing along with progress of the disease. The results suggest that loss of glomerular anionic charge sites may play an important role in the development of proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome.
The LYL1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay, we found that the expression of LYL1 was at higher levels in the majority cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome when compared to normal bone marrow. Our study also showed that LYL1 was highly expressed in most AML cell lines and in CD34+ AML cells. To determine whether LYL1 had an affect on the phenotype and behavior of myeloid cells, we introduced full-length LYL1 cDNA into K562 cells using electroporation and U937 cells with retroviral infection. Both of the derivative cell lines with overexpression of LYL1 had an increased growth rate and clonogenecity. Forced expression of LYL1 in K562 cells enhanced spontaneous and hemin-induced erythroid differentiation but blocked spontaneous as well as PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. Overexpression of LYL1 in U937 cells blocked all-trans retinoic acid-induced monocytic differentiation. The LYL1-transfected U937 cells were also more resistant to the cytotoxic drug cytarabine. These results demonstrate that LYL1 may play a role in early hematopoiesis and may be a potential oncogenic factor in AML.
TLQP-21, a peptide derived from the vgf gene, has been reported to play a role in the regulation of rat gastric motility, but its influence on gastric mucosal integrity is unknown.
We investigated the effects of central (0.8-8 nmol/rat) or peripheral (48-240 nmol/kg) TLQP-21 administration on ethanol- (EtOH, 50%, 1 ml/rat) induced gastric lesions in the rat. The mechanisms involved in such activity were also examined.
Central TLQP-21 injection dose-dependently reduced EtOH-induced gastric lesions (ED(50) = 3.16 nmol), while peripheral TLQP-21 administration had no effect. The TLQP-21 gastroprotective effect against EtOH injury was accompanied by a significant increase in gastric prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production linked to an increase in constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX) expression. The nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME (70 mg/kg, s.c.), the nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg, orally) and capsaicin denervation removed TLQP-21 gastroprotection.
This study shows for the first time that central TLQP-21 exerts a protective action on the gastric mucosa exposed to the noxious agent EtOH. TLQP-21 gastroprotection is mediated by constitutive-derived NO and PGE(2), and requires the integrity of sensory nerve fibers.
In the screening studies, cytotoxicity of 12 methylated resveratrol analogues on 11 human cancer cell lines was examined. The most active compound 3,4,4'5-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU-212) and two ovarian cancer cell lines A-2780 (IC(50)=0.71 μM) and SKOV-3 (IC(50)=11.51 μM) were selected for further investigation. To determine the mechanism of DMU-212 cytotoxicity, its ability to induce apoptosis was examined. DMU-212 arrested cell cycle in the G2/M or G0/G1 phase which resulted in apoptosis of both cell lines. The expression level of 84 apoptosis-related genes was investigated. In SKOV-3 cells DMU-212 caused up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax, Apaf-1 and p53 genes, specific to intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, and a decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl 2110 mRNA expressions. Conversely, in A-2780 cells an increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes Fas, FasL, TNF, TNFRSF10A, TNFRSF21, TNFRSF16 specific to extracellular mechanism of apoptosis was observed. There are no data published so far regarding the receptor mediated apoptosis induced by DMU-212. The activation of caspase-3/7 was correlated with decreased TRAF-1 and BIRC-2 expression level in A-2780 cells exposed to DMU-212. DMU-212 caused a decrease in CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA levels in A-2780 by 50% and 75%, and in SKOV-3 cells by 15% and 45%, respectively. The protein expression was also reduced in both cell lines. It is noteworthy that the expression of CYP1B1 protein was entirely inhibited in A-2780 cells treated with DMU-212. It can be suggested that different CYP1B1 expression patterns in either ovarian cell line may affect their sensitivity to cytotoxic activity of DMU-212.
Several genes have been involved in drug resistance but none are currently used in the drug decision process. To address this problem, mRNA levels were measured for the 5-fluorouracil metabolism-related genes, thymidylate synthase, thymidine phosphorylase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase in tumor samples of 40 patients with synchronous metastatic colon cancer by quantitative RT-PCR. Drug response and overall survival were also obtained for each patient. A logistic regression model was defined to calculate a response predicting score (RPS) with gene expression levels. This RPS split responders from nonresponders as, at the best statistical threshold (0.35), the area of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve established with this method was 0.82 and sensitivity and specificity were respectively 100% and 65.4%. Furthermore patients with scores above 0.35 tended to have better overall survival than those with a score less than 0.35 (p = 0.09).
Glucocorticoids may improve lung function in newborns with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), but information on the acute side effects of glucocorticoids in infants is limited. In this study using a rabbit model of MAS, we addressed the hypothesis that systemic administration of dexamethasone causes acute cardiovascular changes. Adult rabbits were treated with 2 intravenous doses of dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg each) or saline at 0.5 h and 2.5 h after intratracheal instillation of human meconium or saline. Animals were oxygen-ventilated for 5 h after the first dose of treatment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and short-term heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed during treatment, for 5 min immediately after each dose, and for the 5 h of the experiment. In the meconium-instilled animals, dexamethasone increased blood pressure, decreased heart rate, increased HRV parameters, and caused cardiac arrhythmia during and immediately after administration. In the saline-instilled animals, the effect of dexamethasone was inconsistent. In these animals, the acute effects of dexamethasone on blood pressure and cardiac rhythm were reversed after 30 min, whereas heart rate continued to decrease and HRV parameters continued to increase for 5 h after the first dose of dexamethasone. These effects were more pronounced in meconium-instilled animals. If systemic glucocorticoids are used in the treatment of MAS, cardiovascular side effects of glucocorticoids should be considered.
The pathophysiology of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is constituted by pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension (PH). We previously reported successful treatment with imatinib of a patient with CDH. This study examines the effect of antenatal imatinib administration on the pulmonary vasculature in a rat model of CDH. Pregnant rats were given nitrofen to induce CDH. Controls were given olive oil. Half of the CDH fetuses and half of the controls were treated with imatinib antenatally E17-E21, rendering four groups: Control, Control+Imatinib, CDH, and CDH+Imatinib. Lung sections were obtained for morphometry and immunohistochemistry, and protein was purified for Western blot. Effects of nitrofen and imatinib on Ki-67, caspase-3, PDGF-B, and PDGF receptors were analyzed. Imatinib significantly reduced medial wall thickness in pulmonary arteries of rats with CDH. It also normalized lumen area and reduced the proportion of fully muscularized arteries. Imatinib also caused medial thinning in the control group. Cell proliferation was increased in CDH, and this proliferation was significantly reduced by imatinib. PDGF-B and PDGFR-β were upregulated in CDH, and imatinib treatment resulted in a downregulation. PDGFR-α remained unchanged in CDH but was significantly downregulated by imatinib. Antenatal imatinib treatment reduces development of medial wall thickness and restores lumen area in pulmonary arteries in nitrofen-induced CDH. The mechanism is reduced cell proliferation. Imatinib is an interesting candidate for antenatal therapy for PH in CDH, but potential side effects need to be investigated and more specific targeting of PDGF signaling is needed.
This prospective study evaluated the effects of propofol sedation on the incidence of intraoperative seizures and the adequacy of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings during awake craniotomy performed for the management of refractory epilepsy. Thirty patients scheduled for temporal or frontal lobectomy for epilepsy under bupivacaine scalp block were randomized to receive patient-controlled propofol sedation (PCS) combined with a basal infusion of propofol (n = 15) or neurolept analgesia using an initial bolus dose of fentanyl (0.7 microg/kg) and droperidol (0.04 mg/kg) followed by a fentanyl infusion (n = 15). Propofol administration was suspended 15 min before ECoG recording in the PCS group. The occurrence of inappropriate intraoperative seizures was noted and, based on blind review, the adequacy of ECoG recordings was compared. A higher incidence of intraoperative seizures was noted among the neurolept patients (6 vs 0, P = 0.008). Intraoperatively, ECoG recordings were adequate to proceed with resection in both groups. Evidence of low spike activity on ECoG did not correlate with the type of sedation administered. Higher frequency background ECoG activity was noted among patients who received propofol, but this did not interfere with ECoG interpretation. The use of propofol sedation does not appear to interfere with ECoG during epilepsy surgery, provided administration is suspended at least 15 min before recording.
Pilocarpine administration to rats results in status epilepticus (SE) and after a latency period to the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. The model is commonly used to investigate mechanisms of epileptogenesis as well as the antiepileptic effects of novel compounds. Surprisingly, there have been no video-EEG studies determining the duration of latency period from SE to the appearance of the first spontaneous seizures or the type and frequency of spontaneous seizures at early phase of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy even though such information is critical for design of such studies. To address these questions, we induced SE with pilocarpine in 29 adult male Wistar rats with cortical electrodes. Rats were continuously video-EEG monitored during SE and up to 23 days thereafter. The first spontaneous seizures occurred 7.2+/-3.6 days after SE. During the follow-up, the mean daily seizure frequency was 2.6+/-1.9, the mean seizure duration 47+/-7 s, and the mean behavioral seizure score 3.2+/-0.9. Typically first seizures were partial (score 1-2). Interestingly, spontaneous seizures occurred in clusters with cyclicity, peaking every 5 to 8 days. These data show that in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy the latency period is short. Because many of the early seizures are partial and the seizures occur in clusters, the true phenotype of epilepsy triggered by pilocarpine-induced SE may be difficult to characterize without continuous long-term video-EEG monitoring. Finally, our data suggest that the model can be used for studies aiming at identifying the mechanisms of seizure clustering.
Regulation on the function of the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is one of the proposed therapeutic approaches to liver fibrosis. In the present study, we examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of CPU-II2, a novel synthetic oleanolic acid (OLA) derivative with nitrate, on hepatic fibrosis. This compound alleviated CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice with a decrease in hepatic hydroxyproline (Hyp) content and histological changes. CPU-II2 also attenuated the mRNA expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1) induced by CCl4 in mice and reduced both mRNA and protein levels of alpha-SMA in HSC-T6 cells. Interestingly, CPU-II2 did not affect the survival of HSC-T6 cells but decreased the expression of procollagen-alpha1 (I) in HSC-T6 cells through down-regulating the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK.
CPU-II2 attenuates the development of liver fibrosis rather by regulating the function of HSCs through p38 MAPK pathway than by damaging the stellate cells.
Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (Mer) regulates macrophage activation and promotes apoptotic cell clearance. Mer activation is regulated through proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain. To determine if membrane-bound Mer is cleaved during bleomycin-induced lung injury, and, if so, how preventing the cleavage of Mer enhances apoptotic cell uptake and down-regulates pulmonary immune responses. During bleomycin-induced acute lung injury in mice, membrane-bound Mer expression decreased, but production of soluble Mer and activity as well as expression of disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) were enhanced . Treatment with the ADAM inhibitor TAPI-0 restored Mer expression and diminished soluble Mer production. Furthermore, TAPI-0 increased Mer activation in alveolar macrophages and lung tissue resulting in enhanced apoptotic cell clearance in vivo and ex vivo by alveolar macrophages. Suppression of bleomycin-induced pro-inflammatory mediators, but enhancement of hepatocyte growth factor induction were seen after TAPI-0 treatment. Additional bleomycin-induced inflammatory responses reduced by TAPI-0 treatment included inflammatory cell recruitment into the lungs, levels of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity and alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis in lung tissue. Importantly, the effects of TAPI-0 on bleomycin-induced inflammation and apoptosis were reversed by coadministration of specific Mer-neutralizing antibodies. These findings suggest that restored membrane-bound Mer expression by TAPI-0 treatment may help resolve lung inflammation and apoptosis after bleomycin treatment.
1. Infusion of daunomycin 50 mg/kg in the monkey consistently induced ventricular arrhythmias which were not influenced by bilateral vagotomy.2. A central sympathetic component to the arrhythmias was suggested because spinal transection, ganglionic blockade or bilateral stellate ganglionectomy prevented any alterations in the e.c.g.3. Bilateral adrenalectomy or splanchnic nerve section protected three of six animals. This source of catecholamines may not be necessary in every case to initiate the arrhythmia.4. Guanethidine was a relatively ineffective antiarrhythmic agent. Timing appears to be important with this agent.5. Pargyline, by monoamine oxidase inhibition or other mechanisms, significantly lowered the arrhythmic dose of daunomycin. Reserpine pretreatment, on the other hand, prevented any e.c.g. alterations following daunomycin.6. Phenoxybenzamine exerted significant protection which may be related to its cardiodepressant properties.7. Alterations in e.c.g. were seen in all (+)-propranolol pretreated animals, although the arrhythmic period was modified in two of three experiments. Racemic (+/-) propranolol, which exerts direct myocardium depression as well as beta-adrenoceptor blockade, was completely protective in four of five experiments. The results of the present experiments indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is intimately involved in the daunomycin arrhythmia.
To study effect of injection rate on spinal blockade and haemodynamic of spinal bupivacaine for Caesarean section.
Prospective and randomized.
Sixty ASA I-II patients scheduled for elective Caesarean section were randomized to receive either fast (20 seconds, group R, n=30) or slow (60 seconds, group L, n=30) spinal injection of 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% associated with 25 microg of fentanyl and 100 microg of morphine. Sensory and motor blockade and haemodynamic parameters were recorded.
Profiles of sensory and motor block were similar in both groups. Variations of arterial blood pressure and total dose of ephedrine were not different between R and L groups. However, the number of patient with systolic blood pressure lower than 100 mmHg were significantly lower in L group than in R group (p=0.04). Incidences of adverse effects were similar in both groups.
Result of the present study suggests that a slow rate of injection would induce lower incidence of hypotension induced by spinal bupivacaine for Caesarean section.
In this paper, the effects of San-Huang-Hsieh-Hsin-Tang on central monoaminergic and GABAergic systems were studied in rats. It was found that San-Huang-Hsieh-Hsin-Tang significantly (1) prolonged the period from the onset of clonic to tonic convulsions induced by picrotoxin, (2) prolonged the sleep duration induced by hexobarbital, (3) inhibited central catecholaminergic activity, (4) promoted central GABAergic activity, and (5) decreased the turnovers of central norepinephrine and dopamine.
A 24-years-old woman with epilepsy treated with valproic acid developed disorientation, acalculia, perseveration, slow responsiveness and loss of memory. The drug withdrawal induced a quick improvement of mental function. In this case, hyperammonemia, hypocarnitinemia, increased protein in cerebrospinal fluid were found. When the drug was discontinued, she had a dramatic improvement. Valproic acid caused encephalopathy because of metabolic abnormality in mitochondria in this case. In the cases of encephalopathy caused by valproic acid, the drug administration should be withdrawn, and appropriate measures had to be taken. In addition, elevation of ammonia in the blood, lactic acid and pyruic acid in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and decreased carnitine level in the serum will be useful to make a diagnosis of valproate-induced encephalopathy.
The clinical and basic literature suggest that hilar cells of the dentate gyrus are damaged after seizures, particularly prolonged and repetitive seizures. Of the cell types within the hilus, it appears that the mossy cell is one of the most vulnerable. Nevertheless, hilar neurons which resemble mossy cells appear in some published reports of animal models of epilepsy, and in some cases of human temporal lobe epilepsy. Therefore, mossy cells may not always be killed after severe, repeated seizures. However, mossy cell survival in these studies was not completely clear because the methods did allow discrimination between mossy cells and other hilar cell types. Furthermore, whether surviving mossy cells might have altered physiology after seizures was not examined. Therefore, intracellular recording and intracellular dye injection were used to characterize hilar cells in hippocampal slices from pilocarpine-treated rats that had status epilepticus and recurrent seizures ('epileptic' rats). For comparison, mossy cells were also recorded from age-matched, saline-injected controls, and pilocarpine-treated rats that failed to develop status epilepticus. Numerous hilar cells with the morphology, axon projection, and membrane properties of mossy cells were recorded in all three experimental groups. Thus, mossy cells can survive severe seizures, and those that survive retain many of their normal characteristics. However, mossy cells from epileptic tissue were distinct from mossy cells of control rats in that they generated spontaneous and evoked epileptiform burst discharges. Area CA3 pyramidal cells also exhibited spontaneous and evoked bursts. Simultaneous intracellular recordings from mossy cells and pyramidal cells demonstrated that their burst discharges were synchronized, with pyramidal cell discharges typically beginning first. From these data we suggest that hilar mossy cells can survive status epilepticus and chronic seizures. The fact that mossy cells have epileptiform bursts, and that they are synchronized with area CA3, suggest a previously unappreciated substrate for hyperexcitability in this animal model.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of resveratrol on gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity. Experiments were carried out in male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g. Gentamicin sulfate (80 mg/kg per day i.p.), resveratrol (10 mg/kg per day i.p.) and gentamicin together with resveratrol were administered for 6 d. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection. Urine, blood samples and tissue samples were collected from the animals on the seventh day of the treatment before they were sacrificed. Kidneys were collected for histopathological studies and fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution. Tissue samples were stored at -70 degrees C in liquid nitrogen for the determination of glutathione (GSH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), malondialdehyde (MDA) and catalase (CAT). Glutathione assay was determined by the method of Beutler et al. GST amounts were measured by the method of Habig et al. Catalase activity was tested by Aebi's method and MDA was determined according to Thayer's method. Blood urea level was significantly increased in the gentamicin treated group. The study showed lowered levels of urea and creatinine levels in resveratrol administered groups when compared with gentamicin administered rats, and the difference was statistically significant. It has been determined that resveratrol caused statistically significant decrease in lipid peroxidation and reduced the level of catalase. Histopathological examination showed that resveratrol prevented partly gentamicin induced tubular damage. The results histopathologically demonstrated that resveratrol has a protective effect against gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity, lipid peroxidation and cellular damage in rats.
To study the electrophysiological effects of oral propafenone on accessory pathways and determine the potential for catecholamine-mediated reversal of these effects, comprehensive electrophysiology studies (EPS) were conducted in 11 patients with manifest (n = 9) or concealed (n = 2) pre-excitation syndrome. EPS were performed at baseline (in the drug-free state), after oral propafenone loading, and with isoproterenol infusion during propafenone therapy. The study group included 10 men and 1 woman with a mean age of 39 +/- 13 years, who presented with symptoms of palpitations (n = 6), presyncope (n = 3) and syncope (n = 2). The clinical arrhythmia was atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (n = 6), atrial flutter/fibrillation (n = 3), or both (n = 2). During the baseline EPS the accessory pathway location was identified as left (n = 6) or septal (n = 5). The mean anterograde effective refractory period was 265 +/- 42 ms, the shortest pre-excited RR interval 259 +/- 20 ms and the retrograde refractory period 258 +/- 39 ms. Orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia was induced in 10 patients (mean cycle length = 324 +/- 31 ms). Antidromic reciprocating tachycardia was induced in one patient (cycle length = 340 ms). In all the 11 patients EPS were repeated after 4 days of oral propafenone loading (668 +/- 226 mg daily) when drug steady state was expected to have been achieved. One additional patient had baseline EPS but developed clinical arrhythmia recurrences after propafenone loading and thus he was excluded from the study; follow-up EPS were conducted on procainamide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Poisoning with organophosphates (OPs) may induce status epilepticus (SE), leading to severe brain damage. Our objectives were to investigate whether OP-induced SE leads to the emergence of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs), the hallmark of chronic epilepsy, and if so, to assess the efficacy of benzodiazepine therapy following SE onset in preventing the epileptogenesis. We also explored early changes in hippocampal pyramidal cells excitability in this model. Adult rats were poisoned with the paraoxon (450μg/kg) and immediately treated with atropine (3mg/kg) and obidoxime (20mg/kg) to reduce acute mortality due to peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Electrical brain activity was assessed for two weeks during weeks 4-6 after poisoning using telemetric electrocorticographic intracranial recordings. All OP-poisoned animals developed SE, which could be suppressed by midazolam. Most (88%) rats which were not treated with midazolam developed SRSs, indicating that they have become chronically epileptic. Application of midazolam 1min following SE onset had a significant antiepileptogenic effect (only 11% of the rats became epileptic; p=0.001 compared to non-midazolam-treated rats). Applying midazolam 30min after SE onset did not significantly prevent chronic epilepsy. The electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, assessed electrophysiologically in hippocampal slices, were not altered by OP-induced SE. Thus we show for the first time that a single episode of OP-induced SE in rats leads to the acquisition of chronic epilepsy, and that this epileptogenic outcome can be largely prevented by immediate, but not delayed, administration of midazolam. Extrapolating these results to humans would suggest that midazolam should be provided together with atropine and an oxime in the immediate pharmacological treatment of OP poisoning.
Oxidative stress is thought to be one of the factors that cause neurodegeneration and that this can be inhibited by antioxidants. Since astrocytes support the survival of central nervous system (CNS) neurons, we compared the effect of alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocotrienol in minimizing the cytotoxic damage induced by H(2)O(2), a pro-oxidant. Primary astrocyte cultures were pretreated with either alpha-tocopherol or gamma-tocotrienol for 1 h before incubation with 100 microM H(2)O(2) for 24 h. Cell viability was then assessed using the MTS assay while apoptosis was determined using a commercial ELISA kit as well as by fluorescent staining of live and apoptotic cells. The uptake of alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocotrienol by astrocytes were also determined using HPLC. Results showed that gamma-tocotrienol is toxic at concentrations >200 microM but protects against H(2)O(2) induced cell loss and apoptosis in a dose dependent manner up to 100 microM. alpha-Tocopherol was not cytotoxic in the concentration range tested (up to 750 microM), reduced apoptosis to the same degree as that of gamma-tocotrienol but was less effective in maintaining the viable cell number. Since the uptake of alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocotrienol by astrocytes is similar, this may reflect the roles of these 2 vitamin E subfamilies in inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating proliferation in astrocytes.
Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a major cause of end-stage chronic renal failure, is histologically characterized by glomerulosclerosis. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of DN, it is important to establish a stable model of glomerulosclerosis in mice, because genomic manipulation techniques (such as gene destruction or transgene insertion) are well established in rodent species. In this study, we found that repeated administrations of streptozotocin led to early onset of glomerular sclerotic lesions in C57BL/6 mice, accompanied with renal dysfunction. During the natural course of DN, glomerular endothelial cells decreased at 10 weeks after the start of streptozotocin-injections, whereas myofibroblastic mesangial cells became evident. Our results provide an animal tool to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of DN, for example to investigate vascular pathology in diabetic glomerular diseases.
Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) is an organotin contaminant, widely detected in aqueous environments, posing potential human and environmental risks. In this study, we utilized the zebrafish model to investigate the impact of transient TMT exposure on developmental progression, angiogenesis, and cardiovascular development. Embryos were waterborne exposed to a wide TMT concentration range from 8 to 96 h post fertilization (hpf). The TMT concentration that led to mortality in 50% of the embryos (LC(50)) at 96 hpf was 8.2 μM; malformations in 50% of the embryos (EC(50)) was 2.8 μM. The predominant response observed in surviving embryos was pericardial edema. Additionally, using the Tg (fli1a: EGFP) y1 transgenic zebrafish line to non-invasively monitor vascular development, TMT exposure led to distinct disarrangements in the vascular system. The most susceptible developmental stage to TMT exposure was between 48 and 72 hpf. High density whole genome microarrays were used to identify the early transcriptional changes following TMT exposure from 48 to 60 hpf or 72 hpf. In total, 459 transcripts were differentially expressed at least 2-fold (P<0.05) by TMT compared to control. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tools, it was revealed that the transcripts misregulated by TMT exposure were clustered in numerous categories including metabolic and cardiovascular disease, cellular function, cell death, molecular transport, and physiological development. In situ localization of highly elevated transcripts revealed intense staining of ADP-ribosylation factors arf3 and arf5 in the head, trunk, and tail regions. When arf5 expression was blocked by morpholinos, the zebrafish did not display the prototypical TMT-induced vascular deficits, indicating that the induction of arf5 was necessary for TMT-induced vascular toxicity.
Circumvention of chemoresistance in the B-cell neoplasm multiple myeloma (MM) might be achieved by targeting certain intracellular signaling pathways crucial for survival of the malignant clone. The use of the macrolide rapamycin, selectively inhibiting the phosphoprotein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream of, for example, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), possibly represents such a molecular mode of therapy. By using a panel of MM cell lines we showed that rapamycin induced G0/G1 arrest, an effect being associated with an increase of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and a decrease of cyclins D2 and D3. Interestingly, in primary, mainly noncycling MM cells, rapamycin, at clinically achievable concentrations, induced apoptosis. More important, rapamycin sensitized both MM cell lines and primary MM cells to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. This effect was associated with a decreased expression of cyclin D2 and survivin. The phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase p70S6K at Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424 was down-regulated by rapamycin and/or dexamethasone. Strikingly, the combinatorial treatment with rapamycin and dexamethasone suppressed the antiapoptotic effects of exogenously added IGF-I and interleukin 6 (IL-6) as well as their stimulation of p70S6K phosphorylation. The induction of apoptosis by rapamycin and dexamethasone despite the presence of survival factors was also demonstrated in primary MM cells, thus suggesting this drug combination to be active also in vivo.
