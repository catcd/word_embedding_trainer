The electrocardiograms of 146 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast were reviewed before, during, and after the patients received Adriamycin (Doxorubicin) chemotherapy (AD). The most significant electrocardiographic change occurred in the amplitude of the QRS voltage. Seven patients developed cardiomyopathy after AD and showed a significant decrease in QRS voltage. This decrease, however, was more severe at the onset of congestive heart failure that at conclusion of Adriamycin. In 35 patients with pleural effusion, there was an inverse relation between the extent of the effusion and the amplitude of QRS voltage in the absence of congestive heart failure. These results indicate that 1) the sudden and relatively severe decrease in QRS voltage with the onset of CHF limits the value of this ECG criterion for predicting early Adriamycin toxicity, and 2) caution should be exercised in the interpretation of QRS voltage changes in patients with significant pleural effusion.
These studies explore the molecular effect of arsenicals on MM cells. Freshly isolated cells derived from patients with advanced, chemo-refractory myeloma as well as human myeloma cell lines, ARP-1, RPMI-8226 and H929 were exposed to the organic arsenical melarsoprol and to the inorganic compound AT. Both agents potently induced apoptosis in myeloma cells. Exposure to 1-5 microM AT or melarsoprol for 6 hours suppressed NF-kappa B DNA binding and enhanced of c-Jun kinase (JNK) activity. Arsenic also activated caspase-3 resulting in the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Fas/TNF alpha related receptor interacting protein (RIP). In contrast to reported observations in acute promyelocytic leukemia, myeloma cell apoptosis was not associated with either the downregulation of Bcl-2 protein or with alterations in the expression of other Bcl-2 family members, Bax, Bak, Bag, and Bcl-xl. This study first shows that arsenic induces apoptotic signaling in MM through the cleavage of TNF alpha related receptor interacting protein (RIP). RIP is a key downstream protein in FasL/ TNF alpha /TRAIL induced apoptosis and a major antiapoptotic adaptor of pathways through NF-kappa B and JNK. RIP has not been previously characterized in myeloma. This study supports the hypothesis that arsenicals share common mediators (RIP, NF-kappa B, PARP, caspase-3) with death receptor induced apoptosis. These studies provide an important insight into the molecular mechanism of AT induced apoptosis and can be used in the development of adjuvant therapy for MM, presently an incurable disease.
Glycol ethers are known reproductive and developmental toxins in laboratory animals, but little is known about their genotoxic effects in humans. In the current article, the authors tested the hypothesis that human in utero exposure to ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) is associated with the development of specific congenital anomalies and elevated levels of chromosome aberrations. The authors conducted a clinical and cytogenetic evaluation of 41 offspring of 28 females occupationally exposed to EGME for an average duration of 4.6 yr. Six offspring of 5 women who were occupationally exposed to EGME during pregnancy exhibited characteristic dysmorphic features that were not observed in 35 offspring of 23 women who worked in the same facility, but who were not pregnant at the time of exposure. Persistent cytogenetic damage was observed exclusively in all 6 in-utero-exposed offspring, but not in their 12 match non-in-utero-exposed controls. The study characterizes EGME as a human teratogen, as indicated by the prevalence of characteristic dysmorphic features and persistent cytogenetic damage in individuals exposed in utero to this chemical.
Hypertensive diabetic patients are particularly prone to renal function impairment. A total of nine out-patients with diabetes and hypertension were, therefore, entered into this single-blind uncontrolled study on the effects of 50 mg/day atenolol on reducing blood pressure and preserving normal kidney functioning. Treatment and evaluations were continued for 12 months. Serum beta 2-microglobulin concentration was used as the index for measuring renal impairment. Atenolol significantly reduced heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and serum beta 2-microglobulin concentrations compared with baseline. Plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels were unchanged, and blood urea nitrogen levels were increased slightly (non-significant). Serum creatinine showed a tendency (non-significant) to reflect the changes in beta 2-microglobulin concentration. Ways in which atenolol may act to improve kidney functioning are suggested. It is concluded that atenolol is a favourable choice for the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients with normally functioning kidneys since, even in long-term use, normal renal functioning is preserved.
A variety of central nervous system pathology has been associated with cocaine abuse, including cerebral vasculitis. We report a case of a 25-year-old woman who died of hypoxic encephalopathy following cardiac arrest due to cocaine abuse. Autopsy revealed a distinctive cerebral vasculitis with features characteristic of hypersensitivity drug included vasculitis. The significance of cerebral vasculitis associated with cocaine is reviewed.
1. To determine whether morphine modulates the development of cardiac arrhythmias through mu opioid receptors by an action within the central nervous system (CNS). Catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmias were produced, in the rat, by continuous infusion of epinephrine at incremental doses until the development of fatal arrhythmias, usually ventricular fibrillation. 2. Morphine, 0.1 mg/kg i.v., significantly suppressed (P < 0.05) the development of epinephrine-induced arrhythmias compared with the control group. This was opposed by the mu opioid antagonist naloxone (1 or 2 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. 3. To determine whether these effects were operative in the brain, rats received an injection of either morphine 50 micrograms/kg or its diluent (control) into the lateral cerebral ventricle intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.). Morphine significantly increased (P < 0.05) the threshold for the development of arrhythmias. 4. To further explore whether this effect was operative at the mu opioid receptor, a more specific mu opioid receptor agonist morphiceptin (50 micrograms/kg) was administered i.c.v. and produced a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the threshold for cardiac arrhythmias compared with controls. 5. The action of morphine was further established to be operating through mu opioid receptors from experiments with the i.c.v. administration of naloxone (+) and naloxone (-) followed by morphine showing that the action of morphine in the brain was prevented by the opioid antagonist naloxone but not by its stereo-isomer that is not a mu opioid receptor antagonist. 6. These data suggest a role for morphine to modulate cardiac arrhythmias, specifically to increase arrhythmia threshold, through an action within the CNS at mu opioid receptors.
Wait-listed (n = 226) or post-liver transplantation (n = 241) chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) were treated with adefovir dipivoxil for a median of 39 and 99 weeks, respectively. Among wait-listed patients, serum HBV DNA levels became undetectable (<1,000 copies/mL) in 59% and 65% at weeks 48 and 96, respectively. After 48 weeks, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time normalized in 77%, 76%, 60%, and 84% of wait-listed patients, respectively. Among posttransplantation patients, serum HBV DNA levels became undetectable in 40% and 65% at weeks 48 and 96, respectively. After 48 weeks, ALT, albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time normalized in 51%, 81%, 76%, and 56% of posttransplantation patients, respectively. Among wait-listed patients who underwent on-study liver transplantation, protection from graft reinfection over a median of 35 weeks was similar among patients who did (n = 34) or did not (n = 23) receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg). Hepatitis B surface antigen was detected on the first measurement only in 6% and 9% of patients who did or did not receive HBIg, respectively. Serum HBV DNA was detected on consecutive visits in 6% and 0% of patients who did or did not receive HBIg, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events led to discontinuation of adefovir dipivoxil in 4% of patients. Cumulative probabilities of resistance were 0%, 2%, and 2% at weeks 48, 96, and 144, respectively. In conclusion, adefovir dipivoxil is effective and safe in wait-listed or posttransplantation CHB patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV and prevents graft reinfection with or without HBIg.
It has been well recognized that toxicity of fine ambient air particulate matter (PM(2.5)) may depend on its chemical constituents, including components such as soluble metals that may theoretically exert distinctive effects. We have recently demonstrated an important effect of PM(2.5) on metabolic function. Since transition metals, such as nickel (Ni), represent an important component of exposure in certain environments, and may significantly influence the toxicity of inhalational exposure, we investigated the effects of Ni as a variable component of ambient PM(2.5) exposure.
Male ApoE knockout mice were exposed to filtered air (FA), fine-sized nickel sulfate particles alone (Ni) at 0.44 μg/m(3), concentrated ambient air PM(2.5) (CAPs) at a mean of 70 μg/m(3), or CAPs+Ni in Tuxedo, NY, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 3 months.
Exposure to Ni, irrespective of co-exposure to CAPs, resulted in body weight gain, while exposure to CAPs+Ni significantly enhanced fasting glucose and worsened insulin resistance measures (HOMA-IR), when compared with exposure to CAPs alone. CAPs+Ni exposure induced a significant decrease in phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α. Exposure to Ni or CAPs+Ni significantly induced microcirculatory dysfunction and increased monocytic cell infiltration into lung and adipose, and decreased uncoupling protein 1 expression at gene and protein levels and several brown adipocyte-specific genes in adipose tissue.
Ni exposure has effects on metabolic and inflammatory parameters that are comparable to that of CAPs. Additionally, Ni synergistically exacerbates CAPs-induced adverse effects on some of, but not all of, these parameters, that may be mediated via the AMPK signaling pathway. These findings have important implications for inhaled transition metal toxicity that may exert synergistic effects with other PM(2.5) components.
Residual dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitter systems due to chronic alcohol use is likely responsible for the occurrence of compulsive alcohol seeking during abstinence and relapse behavior. There is increasing evidence that glycine, which activates both glycine and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, contributes to excessive alcohol consumption. We therefore hypothesized that the blockade of glycine transporter 1 might interfere with compulsive alcohol consumption and relapse behavior.
We used our animal model of alcoholism--long-term alcohol consumption with repeated deprivation phases in rats--to study the effects of a selective blocker of glycine transporter 1 Org25935. The abstinence-promoting drug acamprosate was used as a reference compound. Subsequently, we examined alterations in dorsal striatal gene expression caused by chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption, focusing on glycinergic and glutamatergic signaling-related genes. Gene expression profiles of Org25935-treated EtOH-drinking rats were compared with vehicle-treated EtOH-drinking versus age-matched EtOH-naive rats.
We found that repeated treatment with Org25935 reduced compulsive relapse-like drinking without the development of tolerance. Importantly, these antirelapse properties were maintained for at least 6 weeks in a treatment-free period. This persistent effect was paralleled by a reversal of altered expression levels of a set of glycinergic and glutamatergic signaling-related genes to the levels found in EtOH-naive control rats.
This study shows that treatment of rats with Org25935 leads to a reduction of compulsive alcohol consumption and relapse-like drinking behavior--an effect that persists into treatment-free periods. This long-term antirelapse effect might result from a restoration of normal glycinergic and glutamatergic signaling function.
Sustainable use of military training ranges requires the development of compounds that have a minimal impact to the environment when used in a weapon system. Guanidinium 3,4-dinitropyrazolate (GDNP) is a novel explosive compound of interest for application in some weapon systems. Little is known of its toxicologic properties. To ensure the health of potentially exposed personnel and the environment, initial toxicity investigations were conducted and the results were compared with another widely used energetic (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine [RDX]). In a microplate Ames assay, GDNP was not cytotoxic to bacterial tester strains at concentrations less than 100 μg/mL. However, GDNP was mutagenic to 4 of 5 bacterial strains with and without S9 metabolic incubation at concentrations as low as 0.7 μg/mL. Unlike RDX, GDNP did not have an affinity for the γ-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor convulsant site and was predicted to not induce seizure. After acute oral dosing in female rats, the median lethal dose in female rats of GDNP in tap water solution was determined to be 720 mg/kg. Daily oral exposure to 500 mg/kg per d of GDNP for 14 days caused weight loss, increased liver and spleen weights, and adverse histopathologic events in kidney and spleen. These adverse events were not observed in animals receiving lower doses of GDNP. In this study, the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level from oral exposure to GDNP for 14 days was 500 mg/kg per d and the no-observable-adverse-effect-level was 152 mg/kg per d.
Administration of 2-bromo-(diglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (2-Br-[diGSyl]HQ) (10-30 mumol/kg; i.v.) to rats causes severe renal proximal tubular necrosis. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) catalyses the first step in the metabolism of glutathione (GSH) and its S-conjugates and the toxicity of 2-Br-(diGSyl)HQ can be emeliorated by inhibition of renal gamma-GT. Species differences in the specific activity of renal gamma-GT have been reported and we now describe the relationship between renal gamma-GT and species differences in susceptibility to 2-Br-(diGSyl)HQ nephrotoxicity. Although rats exhibited the highest specific activity of renal gamma-GT, and were the most sensitive species toward 2-Br-(diGSyl)HQ-mediated nephrotoxicity, renal gamma-GT activity did not correlate with susceptibility in the other species examined. Indeed, the guinea pig, which expressed the lowest activity of renal gamma-GT between the species (8% of the rat) was the only other rodent found to be responsive toward 2-Br-(diGSyl)HQ at the highest dose tested (200 mumol/kg; intracardiac). Thus, factors other than gamma-GT activity probably play an important role in modulating species susceptibility to 2-Br-(diGSyl)HQ nephrotoxicity. Although the reason(s) for the interspecies variation in response to 2-Br-(diGSyl)HQ are unclear at present, it seems possible that differences in both renal biochemistry, such as differences in the relative activities of cysteine conjugate N-acetyl transferase and deacetylase, and renal physiology, contribute to the observed results.
Mutation in the CHMP2B gene has been implicated in frontotemporal dementia. The authors screened CHMP2B in patients with ALS and several cohorts of control samples. They identified mutations (Q206H; I29V) in two patients with non-SOD1 ALS. Neuropathology of the Q206H case showed lower motor neuron predominant disease with ubiquitylated inclusions in motor neurons. Antibodies to p62 (sequestosome 1) showed novel oligodendroglial inclusions in the motor cortex.
Dopamine receptor polymorphisms have been associated with specific patterns of novelty seeking (NS) temperamental nature and frontal executive function. In addition, carriers of dopamine receptor type 2 (DRD2)-TaqI A1 have been hypothesized to be potentially vulnerable to addictive behaviors. In the present study, the association between dopamine D2 polymorphisms, NS, and frontal executive function was studied.
Thirty-seven methamphetamine (MA)-dependent subjects and 40 healthy comparison subjects participated in the current study. The severity of addiction, NS temperament, and frontal executive functions were measured using the Addiction Severity Index, the NS subscale in the Temperament and Character Inventory, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, respectively. All subjects were genotyped with regard to DRD2-TaqI polymorphisms.
The prevalence of DRD2-TaqI A1 allele polymorphisms was greater in the MA-abuser group than in the comparison group. Patients with MA dependence also had higher NS characteristics and high scores in total trials, errors, and perseverative errors of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test than comparison subjects. Within patients with MA dependence, the subgroup of DRD2-TaqI A1 carrier had greater NS scores relative to those without, whereas there was only a trend level of lower frontal executive function in the first subgroup.
In the present study, the MA-dependent patients with DRD2-TaqI A1 allele had significantly greater NS scores and lower frontal executive function with a trend level than those without. These preliminary results suggest that MA-dependent patients may have the possibility of genetic and biogenic vulnerability to MA.
As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing at an alarming rate, effective nutritional and exercise strategies for the prevention of this disease are required. Specific dietary components with antidiabetic efficacy could be one aspect of these strategies. This study investigated the antidiabetic effects of the most abundant green tea catechin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, TEAVIGO), in rodent models of type 2 diabetes mellitus and H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. We assessed glucose and insulin tolerance in db/db mice and ZDF rats after they ingested EGCG. Using gene microarray and real-time quantitative RT-PCR we investigated the effect of EGCG on gene expression in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells as well as in liver and adipose tissue of db/db mice. EGCG improved oral glucose tolerance and blood glucose in food-deprived rats in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma concentrations of triacylglycerol were reduced and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was enhanced. In H4IIE cells, EGCG downregulated genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the synthesis of fatty acids, triacylgycerol, and cholesterol. EGCG decreased the mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in H4IIE cells as well as in liver and adipose tissue of db/db mice. Glucokinase mRNA expression was upregulated in the liver of db/db mice in a dose-dependent manner. This study shows that EGCG beneficially modifies glucose and lipid metabolism in H4IIE cells and markedly enhances glucose tolerance in diabetic rodents. Dietary supplementation with EGCG could potentially contribute to nutritional strategies for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Fifteen patients with advanced or recurrent gynecologic malignancy were treated with high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) (1-8 g/M2) and citrovorum factor rescue (10-100 mg/M2). One complete response (13%) and two improved responses occurred in eight patients (25%) with squamous cell carcinoma and one of seven patients (14%) with nonsquamous nontrophoblastic carcinoma had stable disease for 7 months. The median duration of survival in the squamous group was 9 months and in the nonsquamous groups 6.5 months. Mean serum MTX concentrations were proportional to the doses administered and typical two compartment plasma disappearance curves were seen. Adverse toxic reactions were not observed at serum MTX levels less than 7.8 X 10(-7) M at 24 hr and 1 X 10(-7) M at 48 hr post-MTX. Hematopoietic toxicity occurred most frequently with leukopenia observed in 19.5% of courses. Hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic toxicities were observed infrequently. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity occurred in one patient and possibly related leukoencephalopathy occurred in another patient. On the basis of the relatively low response rate observed in this trial and the high expense of HDMTX therapy, the value of such therapy may be limited in advanced nontrophoblastic gynecologic cancer.
Molecular pathogenesis of digestive neuroendocrine tumors (dNETs) is largely unknown. Recently, the serine-threonine kinase B-Raf was identified as an oncogene in endocrine cancer such as thyroid carcinoma. In endocrine cells, the small G-protein Rap1 stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by activating B-Raf. We examined the expression of Rap1 and B-Raf in dNETs and their contribution to MAPK signaling in neuroendocrine cell lines. In addition, we explored the effect of suppressing B-Raf kinase by the recently developed inhibitor BAY43-9006 (Sorafinib) on growth, apoptosis and MAPK activation neuroendocrine cell lines.
Expression of Rap1 and B-Raf in dNETs (19 insulinomas, 15 carcinoid tumors and 10 gastrinomas) was examined by immunohistochemistry, which revealed that Rap1 and B-Raf were highly prevalent in the majority of dNETs. Overexpression of Rap1 and B-Raf activated MAPK extracellular dependent kinase (ERK) ERK-2 and ERK-dependent transcription factor Elk-1 in neuroendocrine cell lines Bon and INS-1. Suppression of B-Raf by BAY43-9006 inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in Bon and INS-1 cells. In addition, BAY43-9006 suppressed phosphorylation of MAPK ERK1/2 and its upstream kinase MEK1/2 in Bon and INS-1 cells.
These results indicate that Rap1-B-Raf signaling may contribute to pathogenesis of dNETs and provides a molecular target for treatment of dNETs.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been reported as a predictive factor for favorable prognosis of gefitinib-treated patients with lung adenocarcinoma. However, its confounding with sex and smoking makes it unclear whether the EGFR mutation is independently associated with prolonged patient survival. In this study, we analyzed a large-scale database to discriminate the survival impact of EGFR mutations against those of sex and smoking after gefitinib therapy. EGFR mutations in exon19 and exon21 named drug-sensitive EGFR mutations were examined to investigate the impact of EGFR mutation, sex, and smoking status on survival of 362 gefitinib-treated patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Drug-sensitive EGFR mutations were detected in 169 patients (46.7%). The multivariate analysis including EGFR, sex, and smoking status showed that drug-sensitive EGFR mutations were significantly related to longer overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001). In addition, we investigated the impact of sex and smoking status according to EGFR mutation status, and the impact of EGFR mutation status according to sex and smoking status on survival. Sex and smoking status were not significantly associated with longer OS and PFS according to EGFR mutation status. Drug-sensitive EGFR mutations were significantly associated with longer OS and PFS according to sex or smoking status. Our results indicated that drug-sensitive EGFR mutations were the only independent factor for longer survival of patients treated with gefitinib, suggesting that patient selection based on EGFR mutation status for gefitinib therapy will lead to a better outcome for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
Ifosfamide-induced nephrotoxicity is well recognized in children, although it has also been reported in adults. Whether ifosfamide nephrotoxicity is more common in children than in adults is not known.
Medical records of adults and children diagnosed with sarcoma whom received ifosfamide with a cumulative dose >20 g/m(2) were evaluated. Twenty-five children (</=18-years of age) and 28 adults were identified.
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3-4 ifosfamide-induced nephrotoxicity was present in 24 and 17% of children and adults, respectively (P = 0.58). Cumulative ifosfamide doses were similar between the two populations, with the median (range) of 70.2 g/m(2) (22.4-72) for children and 59 g/m(2) (20.8-146) for adults (P = 0.25). Logistic regression analysis indicated that neither age or cumulative ifosfamide dose were associated with grade 3-4 ifosfamide-induced nephrotoxicity (P = 0.36).
Children and adults receiving >20 g/m(2) of ifosfamide have similar susceptibility to ifosfamide-induced nephrotoxicity. Factors other than age and cumulative dose should be considered for understanding the inter-individual variation in nephrotoxicity.
We report about a female patient with intermittent claudication caused by ergotamine. She used ergotamine as a treatment for migraine headaches for more than 4 years. The claudication began 7 month before admission. Colour Doppler sonography and angiography showed severe stenosis of the left external iliac and superficial femoral artery. The patient was treated with phenprocoumon for one year after withdrawal of ergotamine. After that the superficial femoral stenosis disappeared completely, but the external iliac stenosis was still present and was consequently successfully treated by atherectomy. The histology showed a fibrosis of the intima and a hypertrophy of the media.
The effectiveness of atropine and glycopyrrolate in the prophylaxis of suxamethonium-induced bradycardia was evaluated in a double-blind study of 56 patients. Three had clinically demonstrable bradycardia, all having received atropine. We conclude that glycopyrrolate offered adequate protection against cardiac effects of repeated doses of suxamethonium.
To report three cases of cardiotoxicity related to the administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with cancer.
Three patients with gastrointestinal malignancies were being treated with combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens. Two patients developed myocardial ischaemia and the other a ventricular arrhythmia in association with 5-FU administration.
All patients survived the cardiac event. No patient was rechallenged with 5-FU. Radiotherapy was continued, achieving a good tumour response.
Cardiotoxicity is rarely reported with 5-FU. The cardiac events can be life threatening. It is difficult to predict which patients will be affected. Clinicians need to be aware of this potential toxicity and monitor patients appropriately.
A 63-year old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine. This reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema. We discuss the signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis.
Rebound effects after withdrawal from hypnotics are believed to trigger their chronic use and to enhance the risk of tolerance and dependence. It was the purpose of this study to investigate the acute polysomnographic withdrawal effects after a 4 week treatment with standard doses of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem compared with triazolam and placebo. Healthy male subjects between 22 and 35 years of age participated in a parallel study design. They received either zopiclone 7.5 mg (n=11), zolpidem 10 mg (n=11), triazolam 0.25 mg (n=10) or placebo (n=7) over 4 weeks in randomized and double-blind order. Sleep EEG was registered during 2 nights before treatment under placebo, on days 1, 27 and 28 of treatment and on days 29,30,41 and 42 under placebo. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were lower in the 1st night after discontinuation of triazolam (p < 0.05, t-test). After withdrawal from zopiclone or zolpidem slight but not significant rebound effects concerning sleep continuity were observed. Self-rating scales showed minimal rebound insomnia after discontinuation of all three hypnotics. In the placebo group no changes of sleep parameters were observed. Assuming that rebound insomnia is part of a withdrawal reaction, this study indicates that the risks of tolerance and dependency are low when administering zopiclone or zolpidem at the recommended doses.
Urinary biochemical indicators of renal injury were examined in 84 male and 38 female ferrochromium-producing workers exposed to water-soluble chromium compounds [Cr(VI)]. The indicators examined included urinary chromium (U-Cr), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT), glutamic-oxalacetic and glutamic-pyruvic transaminases (GOT & GPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), total protein (TPr) and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG). The U-Cr levels in the exposed group were approximately 1.8 times that of the control group. Compared to controls, the activities of gamma-GT, NAG, ALP, GOT and LDH in the urine of workers were significantly increased whenever U-Cr concentration exceeded 45 microgram/g creatinine. The activities of gamma-GT, GOT and NAG were elevated in workers employed for longer than ten years. However, no clear dose-response relationships nor time-effect relationships were found. The present results suggest that long-term exposure to water-soluble chromium [Cr(VI)] produces chronic renal injury. The site of the injury appears to mainly involve the proximal tubule. U-Cr concentrations of > 15 microgram/g creatinine can be proposed as a threshold dosage for nephrotoxicity, and gamma-GT, NAG and ALP are early sensitive indicators of the most valuable for evaluating the renal injury.
To investigate the efficacy and feasibility of a cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) protocol based on Intergroup Study 0099 for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Sixteen patients with stage II-IVB NPC were treated with a protocol of cisplatin-based concurrent CRT and adjuvant chemotherapy from 1998 to 2002. Three courses of cisplatin (80 mg/m2) were scheduled during 70 Gy of radiotherapy (RT), and two agents of adjuvant chemotherapy (FP regimen: cisplatin 80 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day by 4-day continuous infusion) were challenged. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Median follow-up duration was 45 months. Both 3-year OS and RFS rates were 81%. Proportions of patients who tolerated each scheduled treatment were 94% for RT, 63% for concurrent chemotherapy and 38% for adjuvant chemotherapy.
Our protocol of the cisplatin-based concurrent CRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of FP regimen was effective for Japanese patients with NPC. However, the doses and numbers of cycle of chemotherapy need to be modified because of the low compliance rate. Larger numbers of data accumulation and/or multi-institutional trials may be warranted to confirm the efficacy of this protocol.
Neonates undergoing heart surgery are exposed to high levels of circulating catecholamines. Our objective was to determine to what extent epinephrine (E)-related cardiotoxicity can be attributed to induced tachycardia. We assessed left ventricle function by pressure-volume data obtained by conductance catheter/micromanometer technique and correlated it with ultrastructure in newborn piglets (3 to 7 d old). Group A (n = 6) received E (1 microgram/kg/min) for 2 h, whereas group B piglets (n = 6) were atrially paced at a rate (220/min) matched to group A. Left ventricle peak systolic pressure and stroke work were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in group A. End-systolic elastance increased during E infusion (70%) versus no significant change in group B. After 2 h of E infusion, end-systolic elastance was significantly reduced in group A from 9.8 +/- 3.5 to 5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg/mL (p < 0.05). Chamber stiffness index increased during E infusion from 0.36 +/- 0.2 to 0.6 +/- 0.3 mL-1 (p < 0.05) and remained elevated (0.58 +/- 0.2 mL-1) after E infusion was discontinued versus no change in group B. E-induced left ventricle dysfunction was associated with scattered but irreversible ultrastructural changes consisting of sarcolemmal rupture and loss of mitochondrial architecture, whereas only minor reversible changes such as microvesicular lipid accumulation and mitochondrial swelling were seen in group B. We conclude that E cardiotoxicity in the neonate is independent of induced tachycardia.
