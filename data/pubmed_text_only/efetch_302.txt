The etiology of childhood leukemia is not known. Strong evidence indicates that precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Pre-B ALL) is a genetic disease originating in utero. Environmental exposures in two concurrent, childhood leukemia clusters have been profiled and compared with geographically similar control communities. The unique exposures, shared in common by the leukemia clusters, have been modeled in C57BL/6 mice utilizing prenatal exposures. This previous investigation has suggested in utero exposure to sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) may result in hematological/immunological disease through genes associated with viral defense. The working hypothesis is (1) in addition to spontaneously and/or chemically generated genetic lesions forming pre-leukemic clones, in utero exposure to Na2WO4 increases genetic susceptibility to viral influence(s); (2) postnatal exposure to a virus possessing the 1FXXKXFXXA/V9 peptide motif will cause an unnatural immune response encouraging proliferation in the B-cell precursor compartment. This study reports the results of exposing C57BL/6J mice to Na2WO4 in utero via water (15 ppm, ad libetum) and inhalation (mean concentration PM5 3.33 mg/m3) and to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) within 2 weeks of weaning. Inoculation of C57BL/6J mice with RSV was associated with a neutrophil shift in 56% of 5-month old mice. When the RSV inoculation was combined with Na2WO4-exposure, significant splenomegaly resulted (p=0.0406, 0.0184, 0.0108 for control, Na2WO4-only and RSV-only, respectively) in addition to other hematological pathologies which were not significant. Exposure to Na2WO4 and RSV resulted in hematological/immunological disease, the nature of which is currently inconclusive. Further research is needed to characterize this potential leukemia mouse model.
There is evidence that CD4(+) effector T lymphocytes (T eff) participate in the development of lung fibrosis, but the role of their CD4(+) regulatory T-cell (T reg) counterparts remains to be determined.
To elucidate the contribution of T reg cells in a mouse model of lung fibrosis induced by silica (SiO(2)) particles.
Lung T reg and T eff cells purified from SiO(2)-treated Foxp3-GFP transgenic mice were cocultured with naive lung fibroblasts or transferred to the lungs of healthy mice. DEREG mice, which express the diphtheria toxin receptor under the control of the foxp3 gene, were used to deplete T reg cells during fibrogenesis.
CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T reg cells were persistently recruited in the lungs in response to SiO(2). T reg accumulation paralleled the establishment of pulmonary immunosuppression and fibrosis. T reg cells highly expressed platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B via a TGF-β autocrine signaling pathway, directly stimulated fibroblast proliferation in vitro, and increased lung collagen deposition upon transfer in the lung of naive mice. The direct profibrotic effects of T reg cells were abolished by the inhibitor of the PDGF-B/TGF-β signaling pathway, imatinib mesylate. Neutralization of T reg-immunosuppressive activity resulted in enhanced accumulation of T eff cells and IL-4-driven pulmonary fibrogenesis, further demonstrating that T reg cells control T eff cell functions during inflammatory fibrosis.
Our study indicates that T reg cells contribute to lung fibrosis by stimulating fibroblasts through the secretion of PDGF-B in noninflammatory conditions and regulate detrimental T eff cell activities during inflammation-related fibrosis.
Scientific evidence is lacking for the antiarthritic efficacy of turmeric dietary supplements that are being promoted for arthritis treatment. Therefore, we undertook studies to determine the antiarthritic efficacy and mechanism of action of a well-characterized turmeric extract using an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
The composition of commercial turmeric dietary supplements was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. A curcuminoid-containing turmeric extract similar in composition to these supplements was isolated and administered intraperitoneally to female Lewis rats prior to or after the onset of streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis. Efficacy in preventing joint swelling and destruction was determined clinically, histologically, and by measurement of bone mineral density. Mechanism of action was elucidated by analysis of turmeric's effect on articular transcription factor activation, microarray analysis of articular gene expression, and verification of the physiologic effects of alterations in gene expression.
A turmeric fraction depleted of essential oils profoundly inhibited joint inflammation and periarticular joint destruction in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo treatment prevented local activation of NF-kappaB and the subsequent expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes mediating joint inflammation and destruction, including chemokines, cyclooxygenase 2, and RANKL. Consistent with these findings, inflammatory cell influx, joint levels of prostaglandin E(2), and periarticular osteoclast formation were inhibited by turmeric extract treatment.
These translational studies demonstrate in vivo efficacy and identify a mechanism of action for a well-characterized turmeric extract that supports further clinical evaluation of turmeric dietary supplements in the treatment of RA.
We describe our experience in using melatonin to treat insomnia, a common sleep concern, in children with autism spectrum disorders. One hundred seven children (2-18 years of age) with a confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders who received melatonin were identified by reviewing the electronic medical records of a single pediatrician. All parents were counseled on sleep hygiene techniques. Clinical response to melatonin, based on parental report, was categorized as (1) sleep no longer a concern, (2) improved sleep but continued parental concerns, (3) sleep continues to be a major concern, and (4) worsened sleep. The melatonin dose varied from 0.75 to 6 mg. After initiation of melatonin, parents of 27 children (25%) no longer reported sleep concerns at follow-up visits. Parents of 64 children (60%) reported improved sleep, although continued to have concerns regarding sleep. Parents of 14 children (13%) continued to report sleep problems as a major concern, with only 1 child having worse sleep after starting melatonin (1%), and 1 child having undetermined response (1%). Only 3 children had mild side-effects after starting melatonin, which included morning sleepiness and increased enuresis. There was no reported increase in seizures after starting melatonin in children with pre-existing epilepsy and no new-onset seizures. The majority of children were taking psychotropic medications. Melatonin appears to be a safe and well-tolerated treatment for insomnia in children with autism spectrum disorders. Controlled trials to determine efficacy appear warranted.
Valproic acid, a drug commonly used to treat seizures and other psychiatric disorders, causes neural tube defects (NTDs) in exposed fetuses at a rate 20 times higher than in the general population. Failure of the neural tube to close during development results in exencephaly or anencephaly, as well as spina bifida. In mice, nonspecific activation of the maternal immune system can reduce fetal abnormalities caused by diverse etiologies, including diabetes-induced NTDs. We hypothesized that nonspecific activation of the maternal immune system with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could reduce valproic acid (VA)-induced defects as well. Female CD-1 mice were given immune stimulant prebreeding: either IFN-gamma or GM-CSF. Approximately half of the control and immune-stimulated pregnant females were then exposed to 500 mg/kg VA on the morning of gestational day 8. The incidence of developmental defects was determined on gestational day 17 from at least eight litters in each of the following treatment groups: control, VA only, IFN-gamma only, IFN-gamma+VA, GM-CSF only, and GM-CSF+VA. The incidence of NTDs was 18% in fetuses exposed to VA alone, compared to 3.7% and 2.9% in fetuses exposed to IFN-gamma+VA, or GM-CSF+VA respectively. Ocular defects were also significantly reduced from 28.0% in VA exposed groups to 9.8% in IFN-gamma+VA and 12.5% in GM-CSF+VA groups. The mechanisms by which maternal immune stimulation prevents birth defects remain unclear, but may involve maternal or fetal production of cytokines or growth factors which protect the fetus from the dysregulatory effects of teratogens.
Indomethacin has been used in twins with polyhydramnios to decrease amniotic fluid volume. Under therapy, a marked reduction of both fetuses' urine production has been demonstrated within 24 hours concomitant with maternal symptomatic relief. Discontinuation of therapy was associated with a rapid increase in fetal urine production. The clinical observation indicates that the benefit of indomethacin in prolonging such pregnancies is most probably the result of relief of polyhydramnios through decreased fetal urine production.
The authors report a case of fatal hepatic failure in a 19-year old young man suffering from absence seizures and treated for two months with valproic acid (VPA). The duration of VPA therapy before onset of clinical manifestations was four weeks. The prodromal symptoms were weakness, anorexia, and vomiting, then in a few weeks occurred a jaundice and an hepatic encephalopathy leading to death. Among laboratory findings disturbance of liver tests and particularly depressed levels of clotting factors were observed. The histologic study of the liver showed an extended centrolobular necrosis associated with fatty change and fibrosis. The mechanism of this hepatic failure remains unknown. The seriousness of this complication necessitates to respect any contraindications.
The major limiting factor in long-term administration of doxorubicin is the development of cumulative dose-dependent cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure that limit the use of this drug. The present study was undertaken to find out the chemo protective role of methimazole against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in experimental animals. In the present study, doxorubicin treatment in a dose of 3mg/kg, i.p., every other day for six doses showed a significant 2.6-, 3- and 10.5-fold increase in the cardiac enzyme activities CK-MB and LDH and troponin-I, respectively, in the serum of the animals. Histopathological investigation of heart tissues showed swollen muscle fibers with interstitial edema and inflammatory exudate. Pretreatment of the animals with methimazole at a dose level of 40 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before doxorubicin, returned the cardiac enzyme levels to nearly normal value with partial reversal of the inflammatory lesions and the swollen muscle fibers induced by doxorubicin. Moreover, methimazole pretreatment, decreased the doxorubicin level in the heart tissues with a significant increase in plasma level and non significant effect on doxorubicin level in tumor cells. At the same time, methimazole pretreatment did not significantly interfere with the antitumor activity of doxorubicin.
We developed the AJBL6 transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) heterozygous (HT) mouse by mating A/J mice with C57BL/6 TGF-beta1 HT mice that shows increased carcinogen-induced lung lesions with decreased latency to examine progressive events in lung tumorigenesis. Mouse cDNA macroarrays were used to identify cell cycle genes that are differentially regulated in ethyl carbamate-induced lung adenocarcinomas compared with normal lung tissue in AJBL6 TGF-beta1 HT mice using probes that were generated from tissues isolated using laser capture microdissection. While expression of the genes for cyclin D1, CDK4, and E2F1 increased in lung adenocarcinomas relative to normal lung, expression of p15(Ink4b), p16(Ink4a), p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1), p57(Kip2), and pRb genes decreased in comparison. Competitive RT-PCR showed that the levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4 mRNAs were 2- and 3-fold higher, respectively, in lung adenocarcinomas than in normal lung, while the mRNAs for p15(Ink4b), p16(Ink4a), p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1), and pRb were 3- to 4-fold lower in adenocarcinomas than in normal lung, thus validating the macroarray findings. Competitive RT-PCR of microdissected lesions also showed that the levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4 mRNAs increased significantly, while the mRNAs for p15(Ink4b) and p27(Kip1) decreased significantly as lung tumorigenesis progressed. Immunohistochemical staining for cyclin D1 and CDK4 showed staining in >80% of nuclei in adenocarcinomas compared with fewer than 20% of nuclei staining positively in normal lung. In contrast, while >60% of normal lung cells showed immunostaining for p15(Ink4b), p16(Ink4a), p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1), and pRb, staining for these proteins decreased in hyperplasias, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas. These data show that multiple components of the cyclin D1/CDK4/p16(Ink4a)/pRb signaling pathway are frequently altered early in lung lesions of AJBL6 TGF-beta1 HT mice that are induced by ethyl carbamate as a function of progressive lung carcinogenesis, suggesting that components of this pathway may be potential targets for gene therapy.
Therapeutic targeting of the JAK/STAT pathway, the principal signaling mechanism for numerous cytokines, might be an effective approach for limiting inflammation in different organs, including the liver. Therefore, we investigated whether targeting this pathway by the novel JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib could mitigate hepatic damage provoked by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Male mice received ruxolitinib treatments (75 and 150 mg/kg, oral) 2 h prior to intoxication with CCl4 (10 ml/kg of 0.3% v/v CCl4 solution in olive oil, intraperitoneal) for 24 h. Our results showed that ruxolitinib treatments dose-dependently alleviated CCl4-induced hepatic injury and necroinflammation, as indicated by biochemical markers of injury and histopathology. We unraveled also the mechanisms involved in these hepatoprotective effects. These comprise (i) reducing infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, as demonstrated by reducing myeloperoxidase activity and F4/80 positive macrophages; (ii) abating apoptosis of hepatocytes, as denoted by decreasing hepatocytes positive for Bax protein; (iii) inhibiting elevation of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10; (iv) inhibiting NF-κB activation and translocation to the nucleus, as visualized immunohistochemically; (v) attenuating activation of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway via targeting IL-17, but not IL-23; (vi) antagonizing hepatic oxidative stress by increasing the antioxidant levels (reduced glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase and superoxide dismutase) and decreasing products of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal) and total nitrate/nitrite; and (vii) more interestingly, modulating hepatocyte regeneration according to the extent of damage, as quantified by PCNA-immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the therapeutic usefulness and the potential underlying mechanisms of the novel JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib in hepatic inflammatory disorders.
The study was to characterize the polyphenolic composition, antioxidant properties, and hepatoprotective effects of a polyphenols-enriched extract (HMTP) from Huangshan Maofeng green tea. HPLC analysis showed that three predominantly polyphenolic compounds present in HMTP were epigallocatechin (271.2 μg/mg extract), rutin (239.3 μg/mg) and epicatechin (89.3 μg/mg). HMTP was shown to exhibit strong scavenging activities against DPPH, O2(-), and OH, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power in vitro. Administration of HMTP at 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg bw in mice prior to CCl4 injury significantly decreased the CCl4-induced elevation of serum ALT, AST and ALP activities, and prevented an increase in hepatic MDA levels (p<0.05). Mice with HMTP pretreatment displayed a better profile of hepatosomatic index and the improved GSH-Px and SOD activities in the liver, relative to CCl4-intoxicated mice. Liver pathological observation also confirmed the protection on CCl4-caused histological alteration, suggesting that HMTP has potential to be explored as valuable hepatoprotective function food.
The paravasation of radiographic contrast medium has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from local erythema and swelling to extensive damage to the extremity affected. We report the case of a patient who developed an acute compartment syndrome of the forearm after paravenous mechanical injection of 100 ml radiographic contrast medium. After emergency fasciotomy for muscle and nerve decompression the full range of motion and sensitivity could be restored.
The neuroprotective effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a sulfhydryl-containing antioxidant, on experimentally induced subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats was assessed. NAC was administered to rats after the induction of SAH. Neurological deficits and brain edema were investigated. The activity of antioxidant defense enzymes, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), were measured in the brain cortex by spectrophotometer. The content of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) was also analyzed. We found that NAC markedly reversed the SAH-induced neurological deficit and brain edema. We further investigated the mechanism involved in the neuroprotective effects of NAC on rat brain tissue and found that NAC significantly increased CuZn-SOD and GSH-Px activity and decreased MDA content in the SAH brain. NAC has the potential to be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SAH, and its neuroprotective effect may be partly mediated via enhancing the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and inhibiting free radical generation.
Ninety-four patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), 49 with sustained and 45 with nonsustained VT, who had been refractory to or intolerant of other antiarrhythmic agents were treated in a multicenter, open-label study with flecainide acetate. Most had serious cardiac disorders associated with their arrhythmia: 49 patients (52%) had 1 or more conduction disorders on electrocardiography; 43 (46%) had congestive heart failure; 30 (33%) had left ventricular ejection fractions of 30% or less. Patients were initially treated orally in the hospital with 100 mg twice daily; dosage was titrated upward as needed at 4-day intervals to a maximal dose of 200 mg twice daily. Flecainide plasma level monitoring was performed to ensure plasma levels remained in the therapeutic range of 0.2 to 1.0 micrograms/ml. Patients were discharged with flecainide therapy if investigators judged it to be safe and effective. Minimum efficacy requirements included elimination of sustained VT and reduction of other ventricular arrhythmias as determined by 1 or more of the following: 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring, programmed electrical stimulation, exercise testing and in-hospital monitoring. Sixty-eight patients (72%) were discharged with flecainide therapy. After a mean follow-up of 8 months, 45 patients (48%) were still taking flecainide, including 22 of 49 (45%) with sustained and 23 of 45 (51%) with nonsustained VT. Nine patients with sustained VT and 1 patient with nonsustained VT had aggravation of arrhythmia. Two patients had third-degree heart block. Nine patients died after discharge from the hospital: 6 from out-of-hospital sudden death and 3 from acute myocardial infarctions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is very effective in the treatment of resistant schizophrenia. However, cardiotoxicity of clozapine, particularly in young patients, has raised concerns about its safety. Increased catecholamines have been postulated to trigger an inflammatory response resulting in myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and death, although this has not yet been thoroughly studied. Here, we used the mouse to study whether clozapine administration could cause adverse myocarditis associated with an increase in catecholamines. Male Balb/C mice, age ~6 weeks, were administered 5, 10 or 25 mg/kg clozapine daily for 7 and 14 days; one group was administered 25 mg/kg clozapine plus 2 mg/kg propranolol for 14 days. Saline-treated mice served as controls. Heart sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination. Plasma catecholamines were measured with HPLC. Myocardial TNF-alpha concentrations were determined by ELISA. Histopathology of clozapine-treated mice showed a significant dose-related increase in myocardial inflammation that correlated with plasma catecholamine levels and release of TNF-alpha. Propranolol significantly attenuated these effects. A hypercatecholaminergic state induced by clozapine could explain the occurrence of myocarditis in some patients. Our data suggest that a beta-adrenergic blocking agent may be effective in reducing the incidence and severity of clozapine-induced myocarditis.
Mafosfamide is a new oxazaphosphorine that breaks down spontaneously into 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide. A phase I trial with cyclohexylamine and lysine salts of mafosfamide was carried out in 16 patients, using weekly IV perfusion. Dose-limiting toxicities were not hematological, but consisted in the development of severe pain along the vein during administration. A particular mucosal syndrome with sneezing and conjunctivitis was seen only after administration of the lysine salt. The dose of 700 mg/m2 per week represents the maximum tolerated dose with this weekly schedule.
The period of early morning blood pressure surge is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events than at other times of the day. Antihypertensive medication given once daily in the morning may not protect against this surge if its duration of action is too short. We compared telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker with a trough-to-peak ratio >90%, with ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a trough-to-peak ratio of around 50%.
Data from two prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint studies comparing telmisartan force titrated to 80 mg once daily and ramipril 10 mg once daily were pooled. Patients had mild-to-moderate hypertension and were assessed using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at baseline and endpoint. Early morning blood pressure surge was defined as the difference between mean blood pressure within 2 h after arising and night-time low. Patients were grouped into quartiles according to their baseline systolic surge.
Data from 1279 patients were analyzed. Telmisartan changed the overall mean (SE) systolic surge by -1.5 (0.47) mmHg, and ramipril by +0.3 (0.47) mmHg (P=0.0049). The magnitude of surge reduction was greatest in the quartile with highest baseline systolic surge: telmisartan -12.7 (0.91), ramipril -7.8 (1.02) mmHg (P=0.0004). Telmisartan also reduced the surge compared with ramipril in dippers, but there were no differences between the two groups in nondippers.
Telmisartan significantly reduced the early morning systolic blood pressure surge compared with ramipril. A reduction in this surge may help to reduce cardiovascular events in the morning period.
This review deals with the pathogenesis of ischemia-related abnormalities of ventricular repolarization. The most common repolarization abnormality during acute myocardial ischemia is the deviation of ST segment from the baseline due to diastolic and systolic currents of injury. The patterns of primary and reciprocal ST deviations during and after myocardial infarction are discussed. A very tall upright or a deeply inverted T wave, and shortened QT interval are transient phenomena followed by postischemic T wave abnormalities associated with QT lengthening. These changes are associated with lengthening of the ventricular action potentials at the border of infarction. Persistence of ST elevation after myocardial infarction is usually associated with ventricular dyskinesia. The differential diagnosis of this pattern and its possible mechanism are discussed. Also the mechanisms of ST alternans, T alternans and negative U waves, i.e. less common manifestations of myocardial ischemia are discussed. Studies of exercise-induced T wave normalization suggest that the behavior of primary T wave abnormalities after exercise does not alter the interpretation of the ischemic changes. T wave abnormalities are frequently non-specific but the post myocardial infarction T wave changes persist after administration of isoproterenol while various functional and neurogenic T wave abnormalities are corrected by isoproterenol.
A case of renal failure due to para-aminosalicylic acid allergy is reported. The need to check renal functions in the case of symptoms indicative to PAS allergy is stressed.
Cisplatin cytotoxicity is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) activity in vivo and in vitro. We found that an 18-kDa protein identified by mass spectrometry as p21(WAF1/Cip1) was phosphorylated by Cdk2 starting 12 h after cisplatin exposure. The analysis showed it was phosphorylated at serine 78, a site not previously identified. The adenoviral transduction of p21 before cisplatin exposure protects from cytotoxicity by inhibiting Cdk2. Although cisplatin causes induction of endogenous p21, the protection is inefficient. We hypothesized that phosphorylation of p21 at serine 78 could affect its role as a Cdk inhibitor, and thereby lessen its ability to protect from cisplatin cytotoxicity. To investigate the effect of serine 78 phosphorylation on p21 activity, we replaced serine 78 with aspartic acid, creating the phosphomimic p21(S78D). Mutant p21(S78D) was an inefficient inhibitor of Cdk2 and was inefficient at protecting TKPTS cells from cisplatin-induced cell death. We conclude that phosphorylation of p21 by Cdk2 limits the effectiveness of p21 to inhibit Cdk2, which is the mechanism for continued cisplatin cytotoxicity even after the induction of a protective protein.
We investigated the effects of daily injection of tacrolimus (FK), an immunosuppressor, or dexamethasone (Dx), an antiinflammatory agent, on renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in mercuric chloride-treated Brown Norway rats. The tubular lesions observed after one time injection of mercuric chloride were reduced in FK-treatment group, but not in Dx-treatment group. Moreover, FK reduced infiltration of mononuclear cells, especially macrophages, and proliferation of myofibroblasts in renal intestitium and also inhibited renal interstitial fibrosis through the reduction of the expressions of fibrosis-related factors, i.e. plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and transforming growth factor-beta1. On the other hand, Dx reduced lymphocyte infiltraton, but did not inhibit macrophage infiltration. In addition, Dx did not suppress myofibroblast profiferation, upregulation of fibrosis-related factors, and interstitial fibrosis. From these findings, it is suggested that FK may inhibit renal interstitial fibrosis through inhibition of macrophage infiltration, and that macrophages and myofibroblasts are very important fibrogenic factors in the development of mercuric chloride-induced renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in BN rats.
Chemopreventive drugs have the potential to decrease the morbidity and mortality of lung cancer. The development of these drugs could be expedited by the application of surrogate end-point biomarkers that demonstrate chemopreventive efficacy. In this study, the ability of budesonide to prevent lung tumors in mice was characterized further and its effects on biomarkers were determined. Lung tumors were induced in female strain A mice by vinyl carbamate (16 mg/kg) administered once weekly for 2 consecutive weeks. Four weeks later the mice started to receive 0.6, 1.2 or 2.4 mg/kg budesonide continually in the diet until killed at week 20. Budesonide caused a dose-dependent decrease in the multiplicity of lung tumors of 25, 58 and 82%, respectively. Budesonide (2.4 mg/kg diet) administered starting at weeks 4, 10 or 16, decreased tumor multiplicity by 82, 66 and 30% at week 20. Administering 2.4 mg/kg budesonide at weeks 4-20 or 20-35 and killing the mice at week 35 did not significantly decrease the yield of tumors, although both treatment regimens did decrease the size of the tumors and the progression of adenomas to carcinomas. Thus, budesonide delayed the appearance of lung tumors and decreased their growth and progression to carcinomas. To determine the effect of limited exposure to budesonide on biomarkers, it was administered for only 7 days prior to death at week 35. Budesonide decreased the proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling in lung adenomas, carcinomas, parenchyma and bronchial airways by 87.6, 59.0, 41.1 and 25.4%, respectively. Budesonide treatment also increased the protein level of the p21 and p27 genes and increased the mRNA level of p21. Thus, short-term treatment with budesonide modulated biological and molecular end-points in lung tumors that might be developed further as biomarkers for its clinical chemopreventive efficacy in the lung.
This study evaluated the subchronic (14-day) toxicity of selected (0.2, 1.0, and 4.0 mg/kg) daily subcutaneous injections of diethylstilbestrol (DES) in female (C57B1/6 X C3H)F1 mice. Parameters observed included body and organ weights, gross organ morphology, histopathology, clinical chemistry, and hepatic microsomal enzyme activities. The liver, bone marrow, and thymus are major target organs for DES. Liver enlargement, with associated histopathological changes consistent with mild hepatitis, centrolobular necrosis, and sinusoidal changes were observed. Supporting the histological changes were alterations in serum enzyme levels and microsomal enzyme activity. Bone marrow changes included decreases in the number of cells as well as the number of colony forming units per gram stem cells. Toxicity to the thymus was evidenced by decreased thymic weights and lymphocyte depletion. The hepatic and thymic effects were observed at the lowest (0.2 mg/kg) dose. Although all parameters were not assessed for recovery, those that were evaluated returned to control levels by thirty days after treatment.
O-linked N-acyl-glycosylation may regulate protein function by competing with phosphorylation of serine residues. Availability of substrate for this process is regulated, in part, by N-Acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase (NAGE), which interconverts N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). NAGE is also a putative renin-binding protein. This study tested the hypothesis that NAGE is present in the human heart and that NAGE expression is increased in the failing human heart.
Ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) demonstrated increased NAGE gene expression in failing hearts from subjects with idiopathic dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathies compared with nonfailing hearts. In situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, using primers designed to localize NAGE mRNA, demonstrated that, in nonfailing hearts, NAGE gene expression was restricted to endothelial cells and not detectable in cardiac myocytes. However, in failing human hearts NAGE gene expression was selectively activated in cardiac myocytes, but not endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the pattern of NAGE protein expression corresponded to the pattern of gene expression.
NAGE gene and protein expression were selectively activated in left ventricular myocytes from end-stage failing human hearts.
Intra-cardiac repair of congenital cardiac diseases in children with left-right shunt is often associated with acute elevation of pulmonary artery pressure following cardiopulmonary bypass. We studied the correlation between the Glu298Asp polymorphism of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene and pulmonary hypertension in children with congenital cardiac diseases.
A total of 80 children with congenital cardiac diseases at a median age of 3.8 years, ranged 0.1-36.2 years, and 136 controls were enrolled. Most patients presented with significant left-to-right shunt - pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow of 2.8, with a range from 0.6 to 7.5. In all, 40 out of 80 children showed pulmonary hypertension with mean pressure of 42, ranged 26-82, millimetres of mercury. Thirty-one out of 40 children underwent intra-cardiac repair and 15 out of 31 operated patients were found to have an acute elevation of pulmonary artery pressure after cardiopulmonary bypass. The Glu298Asp polymorphism was identified using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Both in patients and in controls, the genotype distribution corresponded to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The gene frequency for Glu298Glu, Glu298Asp and Asp298Asp was not different in the control group compared to the patients (Armitage trend test: p = 0.37). The endothelial nitric oxide synthase polymorphism was related to acute post-operative elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (genotypic frequency 53.3 versus 25%; Armitage trend test: p = 0.038). In addition, the allelic frequency of the Glu298Asp was related to post-operative pulmonary hypertension (Fischer's exact test: p = 0.048). The positive predictive value was 71.43%.
Patients with left-to-right shunt are more likely to develop acute elevation of pulmonary artery pressure after cardiopulmonary bypass when presenting with the Glu298Asp polymorphism of the gene endothelial nitric oxide synthase. This could be used as a genetic marker for the predisposition for the development of pulmonary hypertension after intra-cardiac repair.
