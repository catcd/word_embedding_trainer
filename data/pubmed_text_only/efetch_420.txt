A case of multiple liver adenomatosis in a 24-year-old woman who had taken sequential (Norquential) and combined (Stediril) oral contraceptives is recounted, and 11 other published cases are summarized. The patient was hospitalized for severe epigastric pain radiating to the scapular region, suggesting liver tumor, and becoming generalized, suggesting hemoperitoneum. During laparotomy a ruptured subcapsular hematoma, a tumor 6 cm in diameter, and multiple yellow spots 2-5 cm were found. Histologically the hepatocytes contained intracellular and intravesicular fat deposits; affected cells were located in nodules but not encapsulated. Liver function was normal. 1 month later the right liver was removed, and the patient was released in 15 days. Of the 11 published cases all were isolated adenomas; 4 were simple, 3 complicated, and 3 fatal.
In order to determine if age and comorbidity influence the tolerability of the cytoprotective agent amifostine, we compared side effects related to amifostine in patients > or = 70 years (group I) with patients < 70 years (group II). We evaluated 268 consecutive administrations of amifostine (119 in group I and 149 in group II, respectively), given i.v. at a dose of 740 mg/m(2) just before platinum-, taxol- or cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Transient hypotension was the most common side effect occurring in association with amifostine. Decreases in systolic blood pressure > 20 mmHg were of similar frequency in both groups (27.1 versus 28.8% of amifostine infusions in group I and II, respectively). Hypotension did not result in medical sequelae in any of the patients. The amifostine infusion was interrupted 16 times in group I and 8 times in group II, respectively, mainly due to hypotension, but could be restarted after a few minutes in all patients except for three cases in group I. Patients in group II more often suffered from nausea/vomiting than in group II (20.8 versus 10.0% in group I). Other subjective symptoms (e.g. warmed, flushed sensation, sneezing, metallic taste, mouth dryness, dizziness and sleepiness) and hypocalcemia occurred with a similar frequency in both groups. Adverse effects associated with amifostine were not observed more frequently in elderly patients than in younger ones, although more elderly patients had a comorbidity than the younger ones.
Low dose pulse methotrexate (MTX) has become a widely used therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its good response rate profile. With the increased use of MTX, reports of opportunistic infections associated with MTX therapy have appeared. Fourteen cases of pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia in patients receiving low dose MTX have been previously reported. Yet, no case of PC pneumonia associated with low dose MTX has so far been reported in Japan. We report the first case in Japan of PC pneumonia occurring in a patient with rheumatoid vasculitis who was receiving low dose MTX. A 70-year old woman with 13 year history of RA presented with 3-day history of rapidly aggravating dyspnea, dry cough and fever. She had been receiving MTX 7.5 mg/week for 2.5 months because of her vasculitis symptoms. She had also been receiving prednisolone 7.5 mg/day which had been successfully tapered from an initial dose of 15 mg/day. At the time of her presentation with respiratory symptoms, all of her vasculitis symptoms had been alleviated. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse interstitial shadowing bilaterally and bilateral hilar and right lower lung field infiltrates. Her arterial blood gas showed severe hypoxemia (PaO2 27.7 torr). Polymerase chain reaction assay of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed PC. Although the patient required ventilatory support for 9 days, she was successfully treated with trimethoprime-sulphamethoxazole and methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Eight months later, the patient was well with no evidence of vasculitis or respiratory symptoms.
We describe a case of patient with splenic infarction, admitted to our department for sudden abdominal pain and fever after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation, complicating a dilated myocardiopathy and mechanical prosthetic valve. Diagnosis of splenic infarction was made by enhanced-contrast computed tomography, while ultrasounds and radiography were negative. Anticoagulant therapy, gold-standard treatment, was followed by fast clinical improvement. Moreover, splenic infarction should be considered in all cases of acute or chronic pain in left hypochondrium and especially in patients with emboligenous cardiopathies or atrial fibrillation, the most common arrhythmia source of peripheral embolism in clinical practice.
Leptin, a multifunctional hormone that regulates food intake and energy expenditure, has emerged recently as an important modulator of inflammatory cascades associated with wound healing. In this study, we applied the animal model of buccal mucosal ulcer to investigate the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and leptin in soft oral tissue repair. Using groups of rats with experimentally induced buccal mucosal ulcers we show that ulcer onset was characterized by a marked increase in the mucosal level of ET-1 and leptin. However, while the ET-1 level gradually declined with healing, the mucosal level of leptin increased reaching maximum expression on the 4th day of healing. Therapeutic administration of phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of ECE-1 activity, not only led to a 53.2% drop in the ET-1, but also produced a dose-dependent reduction (up to 50.9%) in the mucosal level of leptin and up to 42.3% decline in the rate of ulcer healing. A marked drop (54.2%) in the mucosal level of leptin and the reduction (46.8%) in the rate of ulcer healing was also attained in the presence of ETA receptor antagonist BQ610 administration, but not the ETB receptor antagonist BQ788. Moreover, administration of ERK inhibitor, PD98059 in the presence of ETB receptor antagonist, but not the ETA receptor antagonist, caused the reduction the mucosal leptin level as well as a decline in the rate of ulcer healing. Our findings are the first to implicate the requirement for both ET-1 and leptin in orderly progression of the events of soft oral tissue repair. We also show that ET-1 is a key factor in up-regulation of leptin production associated with oral mucosal ulcer healing , and that the effect of ET-1 on leptin production is a consequence of ETA receptor activation and subsequent signaling through MAPK/ERK.
The number of agents that are active in patients with metastatic melanoma is limited and cure is not a realistic objective for treatment at this stage. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new combination regimen cosisting of docetaxel and dacarbazine (DTIC), as first-line chemotherapy, in patients with advanced melanoma.
Patients with advanced melanoma (including cerebral metastases) were eligible. Docetaxel 80 mg/m(2), i.v. over 1 h infusion on day 1, and DTIC 400 mg/m(2), i.v. over 45 min on days 1 and 2, were given every 21 days, for six cycles. All patients were premedicated, prior to each course, with methylprednisolone per os.
Forty-one patients entered the study. Thirty-nine were assessable for response and 40 for toxicity. Objective responses were seen in 10 patients (24% of the eligible; 95% CI = 12.4-40.3%, 26% of the assessable and 28% of patients with cerebral metastases were excluded). Three of them achieved a complete response (7%; 95% CI = 1.5-19.9) and 7 a partial response (17%; 95% CI = 7.1-32.0), while 8 patients demonstrated stabilization of their disease (20%; 95% CI = 8.8-34.9). After a median follow-up of 20 months, the median time to progression was 7 months (range 0.5-22) and the median survival was 10 months (1-24+). The main toxicity (G3-4) was neutropenia which occurred in 8/40 (20%) patients. Additional patients had reversible G3-4 toxicities including alopecia, nausea and vomiting and fatigue; 3 of them presented mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel. No toxic death was noted.
The combination of docetaxel and DTIC is active and well tolerated in patients with advanced melanoma. While this combination is at least as effective as various combination regimens, it does not differ from that reported for single-agent DTIC.
Ifosfamide (IFX), an alkylating agent and isomer of cyclophosphamide, is used as a single agent or a component of multi-agent chemotherapy in the treatment of ovarian, testicular, head and neck cancers, sarcomas and lymphomas. Encephalopathy is manifested by cerebellar ataxia, confusional state, complex visual hallucinations, extrapyramidal signs, seizures, and mutism.
We report two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with mutism and confusional state after IFX infusion. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) as the cause of confusion was diagnosed on the basis of EEG pattern and the apparent improvement following intravenous administration of diazepam.
Electroencephalogram abnormalities during IFX treatment have been described but recordings are only available in six cases. In three of them, paroxysmal alterations warranted the diagnosis of NCSE; however, most cases of IFX encephalopathy might have associated NCSE.
We sought to determine concentrations of total and labile iron in substantia nigra from patients with Parkinson disease and from controls to assess if oxidative stress is triggered by an increased concentration of iron.
Total iron concentration in the whole substantia nigra was evaluated in 17 parkinsonian and 29 control samples. Concentrations of labile iron and copper were assessed in 6 parkinsonian and 8 control samples. The total iron concentration, the Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) ratio, and iron-binding compounds were determined by Mössbauer spectroscopy. Labile iron and copper were measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. Activity of reactive oxygen species was evaluated by visible light fluorescence.
The labile iron concentration was significantly higher and corresponded to significantly higher reactive oxygen species activity in parkinsonian vs control samples. No significant difference was found in the total concentrations of copper or iron in the whole substantia nigra between parkinsonian and control samples. Mössbauer spectroscopy detected no Fe(2+) in any samples.
The substantia nigra of parkinsonian patients contained more labile iron compared with that of controls. This labile iron generated higher reactive oxygen species activity. The oxidative stress damage in parkinsonian substantia nigra may be related to an excess of labile iron and not of the total iron in the diseased tissue.
The case of vasomotor parenchymal acute renal failure is reported in a patient a few days after the initiation of treatment by Enalapril which is a new converting enzyme inhibitor. No renal artery stenosis could be demonstrated, which is in contrast with the numerous cases reported up to now. However the helping roles of an incomplete obstruction by a peri-aneurysmal retroperitoneal sclerosis, of prolonged anterior treatment with flurbiprofen and of simultaneous administration of furosemide may be discussed.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system of as yet unknown aetiology. A consensus of opinion has suggested that the disorder is the result of an interplay between environmental factors and susceptibility genes. We have used a battery of analytical techniques to determine if the urinary excretion of i) markers of oxidative damage; ii) iron and iii) the environmental toxin aluminium and its antagonist, silicon, are altered in relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Urinary concentrations of oxidative biomarkers, MDA and TBARS, were not found to be useful indicators of inflammatory disease in MS. However, urinary concentrations of another potential marker for inflammation and oxidative stress, iron, were significantly increased in SPMS (P<0.01) and insignificantly increased in RRMS (P>0.05). Urinary concentrations of aluminium were also significantly increased in RRMS (P<0.001) and SPMS (P <0.05) such that the levels of aluminium excretion in the former were similar to those observed in individuals undergoing metal chelation therapy. The excretion of silicon was lower in MS and significantly so in SPMS (P<0.05). Increased excretion of iron in urine supported a role for iron dysmetabolism in MS. Levels of urinary aluminium excretion similar to those seen in aluminium intoxication suggested that aluminium may be a hitherto unrecognized environmental factor associated with the aetiology of MS. If aluminium is involved in MS then an increased dietary intake of its natural antagonist, silicon, might be a therapeutic option.
To investigate the 2-year outcome of the first 131 crack cocaine users who had been admitted for a period of inpatient treatment.
Follow-up study of consecutive patients admitted between 1992 and 1994.
Inpatient detoxification unit of a public general hospital in São Paulo City, Brazil.
131 consecutive crack cocaine users.
Reported crack use during last 12 months, incarceration and death.
After 2 years, 50 patients reported crack use in the last 12 months, 29 said that they had not used it during this period, 9 were in prison, 13 had died, 2 had disappeared and no information was available on 28.
Crack cocaine use seems to be associated with a high mortality rate and criminal involvement but about one-third of patients give up using the drug within 2 years of inpatient treatment.
Two hundred one patients were entered in a single-dose phase I trial of WR-2721 [S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid]. Major toxic effects included emesis and hypotension. The observed minor toxic effects were somnolence and sneezing. Two infusion schedules were tested: long-infusion time, which fixed the rate, but varied total time; and short-infusion time, which varied the rate, but fixed the time to 15 minutes. Emesis was significantly influenced by infusion time; the long schedule caused a 57% incidence whereas the short schedule caused only a 28% incidence. Within the long-infusion group, higher-dose patients and women were more likely to vomit. Although only 15% of the entire group had hypotension, the long-infusion schedule had a hypotension incidence of 23%; the short schedule had an incidence of only 3% (P less than 0.0005). Within the long-infusion group, dose and tumor site significantly influenced the incidence of hypotension. No factors were associated with these toxic effects in the short-infusion schedule. However, certain toxic effects were too infrequent to detect significant differences. For future trials we recommend 740 mg/m2 infused in 15 minutes. With this schedule, vomiting was seen in 25% of infusions and hypotension was seen in only one of 68 infusions. To date, no delayed toxic effects have been detected in any organ system, and the trial resulted in no toxic deaths.
Injection of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) into muscle results in cleavage of the synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) and relatively long-term paralysis. However, nerve-terminal sprouting, which appears to require intact SNAP-25, has been reported to occur much earlier. The difference between the long-term paralysis induced by injection of BoNT/A and the short time needed for sprouting led us to investigate the relationship between BoNT/A catalyzed cleavage of SNAP-25 and muscle function. The effect of BoNT/A on SNAP-25 present in nerve endings innervating gastrocnemius muscles of rats was monitored over time. Cleaved SNAP-25 was found in nerve terminals innervating the muscles within 24h of inoculation with BoNT/A and was present more than 2 months later. Comparison of the ratios of cleaved to intact SNAP-25 from the onset of BoNT/A-induced paralysis until function was regained indicated that paralysis was probable when the ratio of cleaved to intact SNAP-25 was greater than 0.35.
Amiloride was administered to 19 oncology patients exhibiting marked amphotericin B-induced electrolyte wasting. Mean serum potassium concentrations increased in the 5 days preceding and following administration (3.4 +/- 0.5 versus 3.9 +/- 0.8 mmol/L, P = 0.002). A trend towards decreased potassium supplementation was also observed (48.0 +/- 66.5 versus 29.4 +/- 43.2 mmol/day, P = 0.12). Amiloride is a therapeutic option to decrease potassium wasting in patients being treated with amphotericin B.
To investigate whether histamine H2-receptor antagonists are sufficient to treat heartburn in nonerosive reflux disease in Japanese, who produce less gastric acid than Westerners, the efficacy of famotidine in Japanese nonerosive reflux disease patients was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group-comparative, multicenter study.
The Los Angeles classification system with Japanese modifications was used to assess the severity of nonerosive reflux disease. Famotidine (10-or 20-mg doses) or placebo was administered to patients twice daily for 8 weeks. Heartburn symptoms were recorded daily by patients.
A total of 528 patients participated in the study. The percentage of days without heartburn, the primary end point of the efficacy evaluation, was 62% for 40 mg and 59% for 20 mg of famotidine, and 55% for placebo, with a statistically significant difference between the 40-mg dose and placebo (P = 0.001; significance level, 0.025 one-sided). Famotidine at both doses provided immediate relief from heartburn, and relief persisted throughout the 8-week study with the 40-mg dose.
The results indicate that famotidine relieves heartburn symptoms in Japanese nonerosive reflux disease patients.
The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonists counteract morphine-induced respiratory depression. Studies were conducted in anesthetized rats, and respiratory activity was monitored with diaphragm electromyography. Morphine was administered i.v. in doses that produce apnea. Once apnea was established, i.v. administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist drug 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) at 10 or 100 microgram/kg restored normal breathing in each animal (n = 24). This antagonistic effect of 8-OH-DPAT on morphine-induced respiratory depression was observed in both spontaneously breathing and artificially ventilated animals. Results obtained with 8-OH-DPAT were mimicked by buspirone (50 microgram/kg i.v.), another 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist drug. Pretreatment with 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'[N-(2'-pyridinyl]-p-iodo-benzamido]ethyl]pi perazine, an antagonist of 5-HT(1A) receptors, prevented 8-OH-DPAT from counteracting morphine-induced apnea. These results indicate that activation of central nervous system 5-HT(1A) receptors is an effective way of reversing morphine-induced respiratory depression. Most important, this is the third model of disturbed respiratory function in which drugs that stimulate 5-HT(1A) receptors have been shown to restore breathing to near-normal levels.
Cocaine is a known potent vasoconstrictor known to cause various complications ranging from nasal septum perforations to myocardial ischemia. Many gastrointestinal effects of cocaine are reported, including bowel ischemia and gangrene. The knowledge on endoscopic appearance of cocaine-induced gastric ulcers is limited, mainly due to presentation of patients with frank perforations. We report a case of 48 year old male, a non-smoker but chronic substance abuser, who presented with abdominal pain, mainly epigastric with radiation to the back. Abdominal CT scan was normal, and endoscopy showing a single chronic non-bleeding ulcer at the incisura. The ulcer due to large sized, round in shape with irregular borders and thick eschar appearance is characteristic of cocaine-induced ulcer. It is important for physicians to remain cognisant of gastrointestinal complications of cocaine, recognise these ulcers endoscopically and prevent perforations in these subsets of patients.
We assessed the tolerability of and response to citalopram in depressed patients who had discontinued fluoxetine treatment due to adverse events.
Fifty-five outpatients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder and a confirmed history of intolerance to fluoxetine (mean final dose = 24.6 mg/day) were switched to citalopram (20 mg/day) after a 2- to 4-week single-blind placebo washout period. During a 6-week, open-label treatment protocol, citalopram could be titrated up to 40 mg/day. Safety and tolerability, including reemergence of symptoms that previously had been associated with fluoxetine, were assessed by recording all spontaneously reported or observed adverse events. Efficacy was evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, and several other measures. Response was defined as a CGI-Improvement score at endpoint of 1 or 2 (i.e., very much or much improved).
Ninety-five percent of patients (N = 52) completed the citalopram trial. The only adverse events reported by more than 5 patients (>or= 10%) were pharyngitis (15%) and constipation (11%), and none of the 3 early terminations were attributed to adverse events. The rate of recurrence of the fluoxetine-associated adverse events was low, with headache (3 [27%] of 11 cases), nausea (2 [22%] of 9 cases), and decreased libido (5 [18%] of 28 cases) being the most common. Significant improvement from baseline HAM-D (p <.001) was observed by the first week of citalopram therapy and continued until study end. The intent-to-treat CGI response rate was 65% (36 of 55 patients) at study endpoint; 69% (36 of 52 patients) of the completers responded.
These data suggest that fluoxetine-intolerant patients can be treated effectively with citalopram.
This double-blind, randomized, parallel group clinical investigation in 140 consecutive patients undergoing aorto-femoral arteriography was carried out to compare iodixanol (Visipaque) 270 mgI ml-1 with iopamidol (Iopamiro) 300 mgI ml-1. The aims of the study were to compare adverse events and discomfort, clinical chemistry parameters in blood, haemodynamics and diagnostic information of the angiograms in the two groups. The main parameter for statistical analysis was the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for overall discomfort experienced by the patients during the examination. 134 patients, 69 and 65 receiving iodixanol and iopamidol, respectively, were examined according to the protocol and included in the evaluation. The two groups of patients were judged to be comparative. Statistically significant milder discomfort was felt with iodixanol than with iopamidol (p = 0.0001); mean VAS values 16 mm and 51 mm, respectively. Pain was reported far less frequently after iodixanol than after iopamidol (7.4% versus 50.8%) whereas sensation of warmth was less intense after iodixanol than after iopamidol. Four patients in the iodixanol group and two in the iopamidol group reported transient, non-serious adverse events. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.68). Systolic blood pressure was affected to a slightly greater degree after injection of iopamidol than after injection of iodixanol. Measurements of diastolic blood pressure, as well as clinical chemistry parameters in blood, revealed no changes of clinical importance, and all arteriograms performed were of diagnostic value. The conclusion is that iodixanol 270 mgI ml-1 is as efficacious as iopamidol 300 mgI ml-1, but produces less discomfort during arteriography. As such, iodixanol is a good alternative to iopamidol in aorto-femoral angiography.
Intravenous administration of paclitaxel is hindered by poor water solubility of the drug. Currently, paclitaxel is dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and Cremophor EL; however, this formulation (Taxol) is associated with significant side effects, which are considered to be related to the pharmaceutical vehicle. A new polymer-conjugated derivative of paclitaxel, PNU166945, was investigated in a dose-finding phase I study to document toxicity and pharmacokinetics. A clinical phase I study was initiated in patients with refractory solid tumors. PNU16645 was administered as a 1-h infusion every 3 weeks at a starting dose of 80 mg/m(2), as paclitaxel equivalents. Pharmacokinetics of polymer-bound and released paclitaxel were determined during the first course. Twelve patients in total were enrolled in the study. The highest dose level was 196 mg/m(2), at which we did not observe any dose-limiting toxicities. Hematologic toxicity of PNU166945 was mild and dose independent. One patient developed a grade 3 neurotoxicity. A partial response was observed in one patient with advanced breast cancer. PNU166945 displayed a linear pharmacokinetic behavior for the bound fraction as well as for released paclitaxel. The study was discontinued prematurely due to severe neurotoxicity observed in additional rat studies. The presented phase I study with PNU166945, a water-soluble polymeric drug conjugate of paclitaxel, shows an alteration in pharmacokinetic behavior when paclitaxel is administered as a polymer-bound drug. Consequently, the safety profile may differ significantly from standard paclitaxel.
The objectives of this study are to determine whether patients with overactive bladder (OAB) and nocturia achieved relief of their nighttime voiding symptoms when treated with solifenacin and whether having nocturnal polyuria (NP) affected that response. The patients pooled from four phase III clinical trials were evaluated for reductions in nocturia episodes after treatment with solifenacin (5 or 10 mg) or placebo. A second analysis was performed in patients with and without NP. The patients treated with solifenacin experienced statistically significant reductions in nocturia episodes; median reductions were -35.5% for 5 mg of solifenacin and -36.4% for 10 mg of solifenacin compared with -25.0% for placebo, and significantly more patients treated with solifenacin vs placebo achieved a mean nocturic frequency of <or=1 episode/night. Solifenacin significantly reduced nocturia episodes only in patients without NP (mean change was -0.61 episodes/night for both doses compared with -0.43 episodes for placebo). Solifenacin significantly improved nocturia symptoms only in OAB patients without NP.
The authors report a case of myasthenia gravis syndrome appearing six months after the start of d-Penicillamine treatment for rheumatoid polyarthritis and disappearing rapidly and definitively after cessation of that treatment. In connection with the case the authors review some forty similar cases in the literature and consider the principal clinical, electrophysiological and immunological aspects. They also discuss the etiopathogenic hypotheses and treatment of this iatrogenic complication.
A pretherapy serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level above five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) is known to predict hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during lamivudine therapy for chronic hepatitis B patients. However, whether an even higher pretherapy serum ALT value or other viral factors could affect treatment responses remains unclear.
A total of 253 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients who had a pretherapy serum ALT level over five times ULN and received lamivudine for 12-18 months were retrospectively collected. Among these patients, 38% had received prior lamivudine treatment. HBeAg seroconversion was the primary endpoint of treatment. Baseline clinical and viral features were compared between responders and non-responders at the end of treatment and 6 months post-treatment.
At the end of therapy, the overall HBeAg seroconversion rate was 33.6%. For lamivudine-naïve patients, the HBeAg seroconversion rate was 37.8%. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with pretherapy ALT levels over 10 times ULN had a significantly higher HBeAg seroconversion rate than those with a pretherapy ALT level between five and 10 times ULN at 3 months (P=0.045) and 6 months (P=0.037) of lamivudine treatment. No significant difference was found in terms of pretherapy serum ALT values, viral load and genotypes between seroconverters and non-seroconverters.
For lamivudine-treated HBeAg-positive patients with pretherapy ALT levels over five times ULN, an even higher ALT level could predict earlier HBeAg seroconversion; however, neither ALT levels nor viral factors correlate with higher response rates after 12-18 months of treatment.
