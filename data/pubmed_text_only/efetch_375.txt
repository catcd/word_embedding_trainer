This paper compares the metabolic changes associated with risperidone treatment in schizophrenia to those induced by haloperidol, as a representative typical neuroleptic. A group of 11 schizophrenic patients of recent onset underwent two [18F] fluoro-desoxi-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans at rest: the first one at the moment of the diagnosis, after a minimal treatment with haloperidol followed by wash-out, and the second one after 6 months on risperidone. The study also included 34 patients on chronic haloperidol for comparison. PET images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM'99) methods. The only change after treatment with risperidone with respect to the baseline was a slight increase in activity in the primary visual area and the right insula. Patients on chronic haloperidol showed increased activity in the motor cortex and cerebellum, as compared to both minimally treated and risperidone-treated patients. The pattern of metabolic changes induced by risperidone appears to be different from that produced by typical antipsychotics.
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) and infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) are autosomal recessive conditions characterized by multiple subcutaneous skin nodules, gingival hypertrophy, joint contractures, and hyaline deposition. We previously mapped the gene for JHF to chromosome 4q21. We now report the identification of 15 different mutations in the gene encoding capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) in 17 families with JHF or ISH. CMG2 is a transmembrane protein that is induced during capillary morphogenesis and that binds laminin and collagen IV via a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain. Of interest, CMG2 also functions as a cellular receptor for anthrax toxin. Preliminary genotype-phenotype analyses suggest that abrogation of binding by the vWA domain results in severe disease typical of ISH, whereas in-frame mutations affecting a novel, highly conserved cytoplasmic domain result in a milder phenotype. These data (1) demonstrate that JHF and ISH are allelic conditions and (2) implicate perturbation of basement-membrane matrix assembly as the cause of the characteristic perivascular hyaline deposition seen in these conditions.
Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent visual loss. We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia.
Three patients with ethambutol-associated toxic optic neuropathy are described. All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity, colour vision (Ishihara) and visual field. The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm.
Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months. Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases. In the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale.
All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function.
Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up. The author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy, ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.
Based on the previously reported co-localization and relationship between cannabinoid and dopamine receptors, the effects of cannabinoid receptor agonists against cocaine-induced toxic behavioural symptoms, including convulsive seizures, were examined in mice. The anticonvulsant effect of several cannabimimetics against seizures induced by other convulsants was also compared. The cannabinoid receptor agonists CP 55940 ((-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)-cyclohexanol) and WIN 55212-2 ((R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone), and the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide were co-administered intraperitoneally with cocaine (75 mg kg(-1)) or other convulsants such as bicuculline, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-carboxylate (DMCM), L-glutamic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). CP 55940 (2.5 mg kg(-1)) and anandamide (15 mg kg(-1)) significantly antagonized cocaine-induced lethality, and CP 55940 and WIN 55212-2 (2.5 mg kg(-1)) significantly attenuated the severity of cocaine-induced convulsive seizures. Furthermore, ataxic hyperactivity, which was observed only in the cocaine-treated group of mice and could be evaluated by their activity counts, was also depressed in the groups of mice co-treated with each of the three cannabinoid agonists. However, none of these agonists protected against bicuculline- or DMCM-induced lethality or convulsive seizures. In contrast, all of the cannabinoid agonists, most notably anandamide, antagonized both L-glutamic acid (2 g kg(-1))- and NMDA (200 mg kg(-1))-induced convulsive seizures. These data support the previously reported close correlation between dopamine and cannabinoid receptors, and between cannabinoid agonists, especially anandamide, and glutamate (NMDA) receptors. Furthermore, these results suggest a potential therapeutic role for cannabinoid agonists against cocaine- and other-convulsant-induced toxicities.
CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent ifosfamide (IFX) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of ifosfamide for plasmacytoma. He was awake, revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities. An electroencephalogram showed continuous, generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic encephalopathy. The administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely. In the patient described, the presence of asterixis during infusion of ifosfamide, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative myoclonus is associated with the use of IFX.
Reactive oxygen species play an important role in adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy. We showed by in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) that renal reducing ability (RRA) declined on the 7th day after ADR administration. Proteinuria appeared after the decline in RRA. The aim of this study was to prove by in vivo EPR whether the decline in RRA is altered by scavengers such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylthiourea (DMTU) and that it is this change which is responsible for the proteinuria in ADR nephropathy. By showing that DMSO and DMTU ameliorate the RRA, we demonstrate that the decline in RRA is related to ADR-induced proteinuria.
Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology, associated with an accumulation of CD4+ T cells and a TH1 immune response. Since previous studies of HLA associations with sarcoidosis were limited by serologic or low-resolution molecular identification, we performed high-resolution typing for the HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DRB3 loci and the presence of the DRB4 or DRB5 locus, to define HLA class II associations with sarcoidosis. A Case Control Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis (ACCESS) enrolled biopsy-confirmed cases (736 total) from 10 centers in the United States. Seven hundred six (706) controls were case matched for age, race, sex, and geographic area. We studied the first 474 ACCESS patients and case-matched controls. The HLA-DRB1 alleles were differentially distributed between cases and controls (P<.0001). The HLA-DRB1*1101 allele was associated (P<.01) with sarcoidosis in blacks and whites and had a population attributable risk of 16% in blacks and 9% in whites. HLA-DRB1-F(47) was the amino acid residue most associated with sarcoidosis and independently associated with sarcoidosis in whites. The HLA-DPB1 locus also contributed to susceptibility for sarcoidosis and, in contrast to chronic beryllium disease, a non-E(69)-containing allele, HLA-DPB1*0101, conveyed most of the risk. Although significant differences were observed in the distribution of HLA class II alleles between blacks and whites, only HLA-DRB1*1501 was differentially associated with sarcoidosis (P<.003). In addition to being susceptibility markers, HLA class II alleles may be markers for different phenotypes of sarcoidosis (DRB1*0401 for eye in blacks and whites, DRB3 for bone marrow in blacks, and DPB1*0101 for hypercalcemia in whites). These studies confirm a genetic predisposition for sarcoidosis and present evidence for the allelic variation at the HLA-DRB1 locus as a major contributor.
Nitric oxide (NO) inhalation therapy has been widely used in several diseases with pulmonary hypertension. However, application of NO inhalation therapy remains controversial in heart failure. Cardiovascular effects of inhaled NO (iNO) were evaluated in dogs before and after induction of heart failure with and without infusion of vasoactive agents. iNO did not affect the baseline left ventricular (LV) function or the response to isoproterenol in control conditions or heart failure induced by procainamide. Pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly decreased by iNO in heart failure with infusion of vasoactive agents. Unexpectedly, LV end-diastolic pressure was significantly elevated by iNO in heart failure in the presence of infusion of vasoactive agents independent of their types; either the vasodilating agents of acetylcholine and nitroglycerin or the vasoconstricting agents of norepinephrine and angiotensin-II. The end-diastolic LV dimension and wall stress were also significantly increased by iNO, however, those at end systole were not affected. These results suggested that NO inhalation therapy reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, whereas in the presence of additional stress of vasoactive agents, it increased LV preload and end-diastolic wall stress in heart failure.
This study stems from an encounter with a phrenic nerve paralysis in a patient following doxycycline sclerotherapy for treatment of chylous fistula. The purpose of this study is to identify possible histologic evidence of doxycycline-induced nerve injury.
The femoral nerves of CD rats were used as the in vivo animal model. The nerves were exposed to varying concentrations doxycycline and normal saline was the control. The nerves were studied at several time intervals using two different staining techniques.
The results suggest that topical doxycycline induces tissue reactions which are different from normal saline. These reactions include stimulation of a local giant cell inflammatory reaction and disruption of the myelin sheath.
Despite the fact that this study does not give physiologic evidence of neurotoxicity, the histologic results suggest that topical doxycycline may cause nerve damage directly or indirectly. We conclude that doxycycline should not be used for sclerotherapy where unprotected nerves are exposed to the agent until further physiologic tests are performed to prove its safety.
Over the past 3 years, ibrutinib (PCI-32765) has emerged as a breakthrough in targeted therapy for patients with certain types of B cell malignancies. Early stage clinical trials found ibrutinib to be particularly active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), providing the rationale for ongoing phase 3 trials. In contrast to conventional chemo-immunotherapy, ibrutinib is not myelosuppressive, and responses are not affected by disease features that predict failure to respond to or short remission durations after chemo-immunotherapy, such as del17p. In CLL, ibrutinib characteristically causes an early redistribution of tissue-resident CLL cells into the blood, with rapid resolution of enlarged lymph nodes, along with a surge in lymphocytosis. Later, after weeks to months of continuous ibrutinib therapy, the growth- and survival-inhibitory activities of ibrutinib result in the normalization of lymphocyte counts and remissions in a majority of patients. This review discusses the discovery, preclinical and clinical development of ibrutinib, its pathophysiological basis, and outlines perspectives for future use of ibrutinib.
To study tremor side effects of salbutamol an easily applicable, quick and low-priced method is needed. A new method using a commercially available, pen-shaped laser pointer was developed. Aim of the study was to determine sensitivity, reproducibility, reference values and the agreement with a questionnaire.
Tremor was measured using a laser pointer technique. To determine sensitivity we assessed tremor in 44 patients with obstructive lung disease after administration of cumulative doses of salbutamol. Subjects were asked to aim at the centre of a target, subdivided in concentric circles, from 5 m distance. The circle in which the participant succeeded to aim was recorded in millimetres radius. In another series of measurements, reproducibility and reference values of the tremor was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions, at 9 a.m., 4 p.m. and 9 a.m., respectively, 1 week later. Postural tremor was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest tremor with the arm supported by an armrest and finally tremor was measured after holding a 2-kg weight until exhaustion. Inter-observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects. Tremor was measured simultaneously by two independent observers.
Salbutamol significantly increased tremor severity in patients in a dose-dependent way. Within healthy adults no age-dependency could be found (b = 0.262 mm/year; P = 0.72). There was no agreement between the questionnaire and tremor severity (r = 0.093; P = 0.53). Postural tremor showed no significant difference between the first and third session (P = 0.07). Support of the arm decreased tremor severity, exhaustion increased tremor severity significantly. A good agreement was found between two independent observers (interclass correlation coefficient 0.72).
Quantifying tremor by using an inexpensive laser pointer is, with the exception of children (<12 years) a sensitive and reproducible method.
Variation of seizure frequency during the menstrual cycle has been attributed in part to an antiepileptic action of progesterone reducing seizure frequency during the luteal phase, but studies have not distinguished patients with primary generalized, secondary generalized and absence epilepsies. We describe a patient whose absence seizure frequency increased when she was administered progesterone. This indicates that, in contrast to secondarily generalized seizures, progesterone may exacerbate absence seizures.
A radiation-induced mouse mutant, Brachyrrhine (Br), exhibits frontonasal dysplasia and renal hypoplasia, two malformations associated with deficiencies in mesenchymal condensation. The purpose of this study was to resolve the Br locus, evaluate possible candidate genes, and identify developmental defects in the mutant chondrocranium. Linkage analysis mapped the Br mutation to a critical region distal to D17Mit76, which contains only one gene, the transcription factor Six2. Sequence analysis of the Six2 gene, including 1.5 kb of the promoter, failed to reveal the Br mutation. However, homozygous Br/Br embryos showed almost complete absence of Six2 mRNA and protein in craniofacial and renal tissues while heterozygous Br/+ embryos displayed intermediate Six2 levels. Mutant embryos displayed malformations of neural crest-derived structures of the anterior cranium where Six2 is normally expressed. These data suggest a mutation in a novel cis-acting regulatory region inhibits Six2 expression and is associated with frontonasal dysplasia and renal hypoplasia.
One hundred and one soft tissue sarcoma patients from an adjuvant chemotherapy study of the Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute who had received greater than or equal to 430 mg/m2 (range, 430-600 mg/m2) of doxorubicin were followed for evidence of cardiomyopathy. Fourteen patients developed clinical congestive heart failure attributable to doxorubicin. Nine of these fourteen were evaluated by radionuclide angiography (RNA), and all were abnormal with mean ejection fraction both at rest and exercise less than 30%. Sixty-one asymptomatic patients were studied at least once with RNA. In this asymptomatic group, 13 of 61 patients (21%) had abnormal resting left ventricular function. Exercise studies identified an additional 19 abnormal individuals (31%). Overall incidence of cardiomyopathy, as evidenced by RNA, in the asymptomatic group was 52%. By including the fourteen symptomatic patients, the incidence of cardiomyopathy detected either clinically or by RNA in the 75 evaluated patients was 46%. Comparison of patients by age (less than 40 versus greater than 40) revealed a highly significant difference in the incidence of cardiomyopathy (P less than .001). Fourteen of 36 patients (38%) less than or equal to 40 had either clinical or RNA evidence of cardiotoxicity while 32 of 39 (82%) individuals greater than 40 demonstrated cardiomyopathy. No significant difference was seen in those asymptomatic patients in whom RNA was performed less than or equal to 12 months as compared with greater than 12 months after the end of doxorubicin treatment. In the entire group there was no apparent improvement in cardiomyopathy with time, but results suggest that left ventricular function in the group older than 40 years does deteriorate. The cardiac function of patients younger than age 40 appeared to remain stable or possibly improve with time after the completion of treatment. Sex, tumor location, and radiation treatment were not associated with an increased risk of cardiomyopathy. These results emphasize the dangers of full-dose doxorubicin therapy. This high incidence of cardiomyopathy became apparent because of our ability to prospectively evaluate a large group of patients with prolonged life expectancy that received adjuvant doxorubicin chemotherapy after surgery.
The present study aimed to explore the circadian rhythm of salivary serotonin in patients with major depressive disorder before and after treatment with fluoxetine and its relationship with clinical therapeutic effect.
This study investigated salivary serotonin in 13 outpatients with major depressive disorder and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Depressed patients received six weeks fluoxetine treatment (20 mg/day), saliva was collected before and four weeks after treatment. A total of 8 time-point salivary serotonin was measured across the whole day. Multi-oscillator cosinor model was used to fit the rhythms.
Serotonin concentration in saliva ranged from 0.32 ng/ml to 9.62 ng/ml. Salivary serotonin showed prominent circadian rhythm in 91% depressed patients and 92% healthy subjects. Circadian amplitude tend to be higher after fluoxetine treatment in depressed patients, so as the ultradian cycle amplitude. The serotonin circadian amplitude (After minus Before) was positively correlated with the decrease of Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale(SDS) scores at day 42 whereas there was no such correlation at day 28. There was no significant difference in the parameters of mesor, acrophase, harmonic and area under curve among three groups.
Salivary serotonin in patients with major depressive disorder showed clear circadian rhythm. The relationship between the increase of salivary serotonin amplitude and clinical response deserve further study.
Agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) exert protective effects in several models of ischemia/reperfusion injury, but their role in stroke is less clear. The study investigates the effects of two PPAR-gamma agonists, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, on oxidative stress and inflammatory response induced by ischemia/reperfusion in the rat hippocampus. Common carotid artery occlusion for 30 min followed by 1 h reperfusion resulted in a significant increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and the end products of lipid peroxidation as well as markedly reduced endogenous antioxidant glutathione levels and up-regulated superoxide dismutase activity. Western blot analysis showed that ischemia/reperfusion lead to an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, as well activating p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Pre-treatment with either rosiglitazone or pioglitazone significantly reduced oxidative stress, COX-2 protein expression and activation of MAPKs and NF-kappaB. Taken together, the results provide convincing evidence that PPAR-gamma agonists exert protective effects in a rat model of mild forebrain ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and excessive inflammatory response.
Acute renal failure induced by methotrexate can be complicated by prolonged high serum levels of methotrexate, resulting in pancytopenia and severe mucositis. The role of dialysis in these patients has not been well elucidated. Serum methotrexate levels were successfully lowered in a patient with methotrexate-induced acute renal failure by charcoal hemoperfusion and sequential hemodialysis. No rebound in serum methotrexate levels was observed after perfusion, a phenomenon previously reported as limiting the usefulness of this procedure.
The present study was undertaken to explore the protective effect of melatonin against isoproterenol bitartrate (ISO)-induced myocardial injury in rat. Treatment of rats with ISO increased the level of lipid peroxidation products and decreased the reduced glutathione levels in cardiac tissue indicating that this synthetic catecholamine induces oxidative damage following oxidative stress. Pretreatment of ISO-injected rats with melatonin at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight, i.p. prevented these changes. Additionally, melatonin also restored the activities and the levels of antioxidant enzymes which were found to be altered by ISO treatment. Treatment of rats with ISO resulted into an increased generation of hydroxyl radicals with melatonin pretreatment significantly reducing their production. Finally, treatment of rats with ISO caused a lowering of systolic pressure with reduced cardiac output and diastolic dysfunction whereas melatonin pretreatment significantly restored many of these parameters to normal. The findings document melatonin's ability to provide cardio protection at a low pharmacological dose. Melatonin has virtually no toxicity which raises the possibility of this indole being a therapeutic treatment for ischemic heart disease.
Kawasaki disease is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology, with clinical observations suggesting a substantial genetic contribution to disease susceptibility. We conducted a genome-wide association study and replication analysis in 2,173 individuals with Kawasaki disease and 9,383 controls from five independent sample collections. Two loci exceeded the formal threshold for genome-wide significance. The first locus is a functional polymorphism in the IgG receptor gene FCGR2A (encoding an H131R substitution) (rs1801274; P = 7.35 × 10(-11), odds ratio (OR) = 1.32), with the A allele (coding for histadine) conferring elevated disease risk. The second locus is at 19q13, (P = 2.51 × 10(-9), OR = 1.42 for the rs2233152 SNP near MIA and RAB4B; P = 1.68 × 10(-12), OR = 1.52 for rs28493229 in ITPKC), which confirms previous findings(1). The involvement of the FCGR2A locus may have implications for understanding immune activation in Kawasaki disease pathogenesis and the mechanism of response to intravenous immunoglobulin, the only proven therapy for this disease.
Angiogenesis and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) damage have been proposed to contribute to epileptogenesis and/or ictogenesis in experimental and human epilepsy. We tested a hypothesis that after brain injury angiogenesis occurs in the most damaged hippocampal areas with the highest need of tissue repair, and associates with formation of epileptogenic neuronal networks. We induced status epilepticus (SE) with pilocarpine in adult rats, and investigated endothelial cell proliferation (BrdU and rat endothelial cell antigen-1 (RECA-1) double-labeling), vessel length (unbiased stereology), thrombocyte aggregation (thrombocyte immunostaining), neurodegeneration (Nissl staining), neurogenesis (doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry), and mossy fiber sprouting (Timm staining) in the hippocampus at different time points post-SE. As functional measures we determined BBB leakage (quantified immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunostaining), and hippocampal blood volume (CBV) and flow (CBF) in vivo (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). The total length of hippocampal blood vessels was decreased by 17% at 2 d after status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine in adult rats (P<0.05 as compared to controls) which was not accompanied by alterations in hippocampal blood volume (BV) and flow (BF). Number of proliferating endothelial cells peaked at 4 d post-SE and correlated with an increase in vessel length (r=0.900, P<0.05). Vessels length had recovered to control level or even higher at 2 wk post-SE, angiogenesis being most prominent in the CA3 (128% as compared to that in controls, P<0.05), and was associated with increased BV (178% as compared to that in controls, P<0.05). Enlargement of vessel diameter in the hippocampal fissure was associated with thrombocyte aggregation in distal capillaries. BBB was most leaky during the first 4 d post-SE and increased IgG extravasation was observed for 60 d. Our data show that magnitude of endothelial cell proliferation is not associated with severity of acute post-SE neurodegeneration or formation of abnormal neuronal network. This encourages identification of molecular targets that initiate and maintain specific aspects of tissue reorganization, including preservation and proliferation of endothelial cells to reduce the risk of epileptogenesis and enhance recovery after brain injury.
An ip LD50 value (68 mg/kg) for folpet, a widely used fungicide, was determined using adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Next, the compound in sublethal doses was given to the animals orally as well as intraperitoneally (ip), and its effects on the levels of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) were compared. An ip dose as small as 50 mg/kg was able to significantly alter the levels of these enzymes reflecting on liver damage, while an oral dose up to 10 times the ip dose did not have an appreciable effect on the enzymes and did not cause any visible toxic symptoms in the animals. In vitro incubation of folpet with rat liver microsomes with and without an NADPH-generating system showed that the fungicide may not require metabolism to exert inhibitory effect on the microsomal enzymes. In fact, the data suggest that the parent compound or its nonenzymatic degradation product(s) caused destruction of microsomal cytochrome P-450 in vitro. However, this loss of the hemoprotein by folpet could be prevented by prior addition of reduced glutathione in the incubation media.
Immunosuppression of recipients of renal transplants with azathioprine has been associated with two major side effects: hepatotoxicity and myelotoxicity, mainly in the form of leukopenia. Reports of isolated anemia in these patients have been rare. We now observed the development of severe anemia in 9 out of 11 renal transplant recipients whose immunosuppressive regimen was converted from cyclosporine plus prednisone to azathioprine plus prednisone. A significant (P = 0.001) drop in hematocrit (from 34 +/- 4% to 27 +/- 3%, mean +/- SD) and hemoglobin (from 11.6 +/- 1.3 g/dl to 9.5 +/- 1.0 g/dl) was found. Since a common variable of all these patients was their use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as antihypertensive medication, we speculated that the combination of azathioprine and ACE blocker might be the reason for the anemia. We then compared 2 groups of 10 patients each who had been on azathioprine as their regular immunosuppressive agent and who did or did not take an ACE inhibitor. Hematocrit and hemoglobin were significantly (P = 0.01) lower in the group of patients taking ACE inhibitors (33 +/- 6% versus 41 +/- 5% and 11.5 +/- 2.0 g/dl versus 14.0 +/- 1.6 g/dl, respectively). Haptoglobin levels were also significantly (P = 0.05) lower in the ACE inhibitor group (116 +/- 65 mg/dl versus 210 +/- 114 mg/dl). Erythropoietin concentration in the serum and the reticulocyte index were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the ACE inhibitor group but the values were probably too low for their degree of anemia. Comparing hematological parameters of the patients in the ACE inhibitor group before and after beginning of the antihypertensive treatment confirmed a significant reduction of hematocrit and hemoglobin following therapy with an ACE inhibitor. Hematocrit fell from 41 +/- 7% to 36 +/- 6% and hemoglobin from 14.0 +/- 2.3 g/dl to 11.3 +/- 1.5 g/dl (P < 0.05 for both). We conclude that the combination of these two drugs should probably be avoided.
A rare side effect of betamethasone applied subconjunctivally is described. A 51-year-old man who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty in his left eye 2 months previously developed graft rejection and was treated by subconjunctival injection of betamethasone. Within 2 weeks, the patient complained of conjunctival hyperemia and irritation. Biomicroscopic examination revealed conjunctival and subconjunctival necrosis with white necrotic tissue at the subconjunctival corticosteroid injection site. Simple debridement and primary wound closure of the involved area resulted in complete healing. Ophthalmologists should be aware that subconjunctival injection of betamethasone may cause conjunctival necrosis.
Cocaine abuse is an increasing problem in western societies, and health personnel should be aware of the cardiovascular effects of cocaine, of which myocardial infarction is the most frequent reported complication. Cardiac arrhythmia is another serious complication. We describe a young female who, after injecting cocaine intravenously, suffered from circulatory collapse, thought to represent an arrhythmia. The authors discuss the pharmacological and clinical aspects of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction and arrhythmias, and suggest guidelines for treatment.
Pancreatic acinar cell lesions, including foci, nodules, adenomas and in situ carcinomas, were found in male F344 rats given s.c. injections of 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) at doses ranging from 50 to 167 mg/kg body weight in two 60-week experiments. The pancreatic lesions induced by DMAB were essentially the same as those reported in rats treated with 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline-1-oxide and azaserine. DMAB at high doses induced pancreas acinar cell as well as fat necrosis, and tumorigenicity for the pancreas was most effective at high necrogenic levels of carcinogen exposure. Mean labeling indices in basophilic foci, acidophilic foci, nodules and adenomas assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation were elevated to approximately 0.69, approximately 2.17, approximately 1.43 and approximately 0.96% respectively, in contrast to the value of 0.39% observed for the surrounding normal acinar cells. The increase was significant in the acidophilic foci and nodules and the fact that these lesions had very high labeling indices suggests that they may have potential for progression to tumors.
The acute pressor effect of intraperitoneally administered cadmium was explored over the dose range 0.015-2 mg/kg in both pentobarbital-anesthetized and conscious rats. The former first respondent at 0.031 mg/kg, and successive doublings of that dosage increased the highest pressures attained in a stepwise fashion until a dosage of 0.25 mg/kg, the maximally effective quantity, was reached. Arterial pressure did not rise in conscious rats until a dose of 1 mg/kg, which gave the maximum response within the range examined. Heart-rate changes with Cd were slight, and rarely significant at a given dosage, but pentobarbital invariably caused tachycardia. Anesthetized rats thus gave a graded response, while conscious animals reacted in an all-or-none fashion. The increased pressor responsiveness of rats under pentobarbital can not be ascribed to its cardiac parasympatholytic effects, since sensitivity was not conferred upon conscious rats when pretreated with atropine at a dose producing even greater tachycardia than that caused by pentobarbital. Nifedipine, which blocks calcium entry into smooth muscle cells, prevented the pressor response to cadmium when given as pretreatment and terminated an ongoing response when give intercurrently. Possible mechanisms to account for the observed behavior are considered.
Targeting the estrogen receptor is an important strategy in breast cancer therapy. However, although inhibiting estrogen receptor function with specific estrogen receptor modulators can achieve a primary response in cancer patients, intrinsic or subsequently acquired resistance to the therapy remains a major obstacle in the clinic. Thus, it is critical to gain a more thorough understanding of how estrogen receptor functions are regulated in breast cancer.Here, we demonstrate that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-ABL is a functional partner of the estrogen receptor, as expression of c-ABL sustained transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor. More importantly, inhibition of c-ABL resulted in sensitization to treatment by tamoxifen (TAM) in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, as manifested by inhibition of cell survival and suppression of anchorage-independent growth. We found that c-ABL interacts with estrogen receptor in breast cancer cells and that expression of c-ABL is a frequent event in primary breast cancer tumor tissues. In estrogen receptor-positive tumors, the expression of c-ABL significantly correlated with disease progression and metastasis. This study shows that c-ABL regulates the cellular response to TAM through functional interaction with the estrogen receptor, which suggests c-ABL as a therapeutic target and a prognostic tumor marker for breast cancer.
Multiple exposure to theophylline, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, induces acinar hypertrophy in the salivary gland. This study examined the effect of theophylline on the gene expression of secretory proteins and phosphodiesterases in the submaxillary gland. Male F344 rats received saline or theophylline (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days. The gene expressions for the secretory protein, cystatin S (CysS), and PDE subfamilies 3A and 4D in the submaxillary gland were quantified using RT-PCR. Theophylline exposure resulted in a sustained increase in mRNA expression for CysS and PDE3A, but PDE4D gene expression was unchanged. Our results suggest that submaxillary hypertrophy is primarily caused by the enhanced transcription of CysS, and that the transcription of each PDE subfamily gene is regulated differently.
