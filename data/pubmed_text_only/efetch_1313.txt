Clinical manifestations of mild organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN) produced by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) in adult hens are potentiated by posttreatment with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The purpose of this study was to assess whether potentiation of mild OPIDN produces a pattern of axonal lesions in the central and peripheral nervous system similar to that seen in severe OPIDN. Groups of 6 hens each were given the following priming/challenge doses sc at 0 and 4 h, respectively: 0.20 ml/kg corn oil/0.50 ml/kg glycerol formal (GF) (control); 0.50 mg/kg DFP/GF (low-dose DFP); 0.50 mg/kg DFP/60 mg/kg PMSF (potentiated DFP); 60 mg/kg PMSF/GF (PMSF alone); 60 mg/kg PMSF/1.5 mg/kg DFP (protected DFP); and 1.5 mg/kg DFP/GF (high-dose DFP). Two hens from each group were used to assay brain neurotoxic esterase (NTE) 24 h after the challenge dose, and the remaining hens were scored for deficits in walking, standing, and perching ability on d 18. Three hens from each group were perfusion-fixed on d 22 and neural tissues were prepared for histologic evaluation. DFP and/or PMSF caused > 88% brain NTE inhibition in all treated groups, compared to control. Protected DFP yielded no clinical deficits and a distribution and frequency of axonal lesions similar to control. PMSF alone produced a small increase in the frequency of lesions in the cervical spinal cord and peripheral nerves compared to control. Low-dose DFP caused minimal ataxia and increased frequency of axonal lesions in dorsal and lateral cervical spinal cord, ventral lumbar spinal cord, and inferior cerebellar peduncles (ICP) compared to control. Potentiated DFP and high-dose DFP produced maximal ataxia and essentially identical increases in the frequency of lesions in dorsal and ventral thoracic spinal cord, lateral lumbar spinal cord, and peripheral nerves compared to low-dose DFP. The results indicate that PMSF potentiation of mild OPIDN induced in adult hens by low-dose DFP results in an overall pattern of axonal degeneration like that produced by a threefold higher dose of DFP alone, and support the hypothesis that potentiation causes an increase in the frequency of axonal lesions in central and peripheral loci normally affected by OPIDN.
43 children suffering from borreliosis, meningitis and septicemia were treated with ceftriaxone. A six year old boy with acute jaundice due to ceftriaxone induced cholelithiasis encouraged us to reevaluate the frequency of ceftriaxone induced cholelithiasis and its' sequelae in children in a prospective study. Out of 43 children (age 6.3 years, 4 months to 16 years, male: female 25:18), 20 children (46.5%) showed sonographical evidence for ceftriaxone induced cholelithiasis after a treatment of at least 10 days. Two of them even had signs of intrahepatic cholestasis, 3 kids suffered from severe abdominal pain, non of them showed serologic abnormalities. Another 5 children (11.6%) had sludge in the gallbladder without evidence for cholelithiasis. In all patients the "pseudocholelithiasis" spontaneously resolved within at most 2 months. We suggest a sonographical examination of the gallbladder at the end of the ceftriaxone treatment in order to detect cholelithiasis, which might call for further monitoring and maybe dietary treatment.
The objective of this study was to investigate initial maintenance treatment with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (Seretide) 50/250 microg twice daily (SFC) compared with fluticasone propionate (Flixotide) 250 microg twice daily (FP) (both via Diskus inhaler, GlaxoSmithKline, Greenford, UK) in patients with moderate persistent asthma currently only treated with inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists. A total of 362 adults and adolescents (12 to 80 years of age) were randomized to this 12-week double-blind parallel-group study. The primary endpoint was mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Secondary efficacy endpoints included median percentages of symptom-free and rescue-free days and nights; the percentage of patients who achieved the pre-defined criteria for well-controlled asthma over weeks 5 to 12; and the incidence of asthma exacerbations. Safety was assessed by the incidence of adverse events. Superiority of SFC over FP alone was demonstrated for the primary and each secondary endpoint. The difference in adjusted mean change from baseline in morning PEF between SFC and FP was 21 L/min (95% CI: 11, 31; p<0.001). Significantly more patients achieved well-controlled asthma during treatment with SFC (46%) compared with FP (32%) (odds ratio 1.84; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.89; p=0.008). Both treatments were safe and well-tolerated. This study demonstrates that initial maintenance treatment with SFC 50/250 mug twice daily provides superior efficacy to FP 250 microg twice daily alone in patients with moderate persistent asthma.
A diet lacking folic acid and choline and low in methionine (folate/methyl deficient diet, FMD diet) fed to rats is known to produce preneoplastic nodules (PNNs) after 36 weeks and hepatocellular carcinomas (tumors) after 54 weeks. FMD diet-induced tumors exhibit global hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation. Restriction landmark genome scanning analysis with methylation-sensitive enzyme NotI (RLGS-M) of genomic DNA isolated from control livers, PNNs and tumor tissues was performed to identify the genes that are differentially methylated or amplified during multistage hepatocarcinogenesis. Out of the 1250 genes analysed, 2 to 5 genes were methylated in the PNNs, whereas 5 to 45 genes were partially or completely methylated in the tumors. This analysis also showed amplification of 3 to 12 genes in the primary tumors. As a first step towards identifying the genes methylated in the PNNs and primary hepatomas, we generated a rat NotI-EcoRV genomic library in the pBluescriptKS vector. Here, we describe identification of one methylated and downregulated gene as the rat protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) and one amplified gene as rat C-MYC. Methylation of PTPRO at the NotI site located immediate upstream of the trancription start site in the PNNs and tumors, and amplification of C-MYC gene in the tumors were confirmed by Southern blot analyses. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of the CpG island encompassing exon 1 of the PTPRO gene revealed dense methylation in the PNNs and tumors, whereas it was methylation free in the livers of animals on normal diet. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed significant decrease in the expression of PTPRO in the tumors and in a transplanted rat hepatoma. The expression of PTPRO mRNA in the transplanted hepatoma after demethylation with 5-azacytidine, a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, further confirmed the role of methylation in PTPRO gene expression. These results demonstrate alteration in methylation profile and expression of specific genes during tumor progression in the livers of rats in response to folate/methyl deficiency, and further implicate the potential role of PTPRO as a novel growth regulatory gene at least in the hepatocellular carcinomas.
A relatively brief course of antenatal glucocorticoids (ACS), given to reduce the severity of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants, improves survival and appears to protect against brain damage. In clinical trials as well as observational studies, ACS have been associated with a decreased risk of intraventricular haemorrhage and cerebral palsy. In observational studies a decreased risk of white-matter damage, identified with cranial ultrasound, has been observed. There is some evidence, from observational studies, that repeated courses of ACS (typically given at weekly intervals) can reduce the rate of fetal head growth, and experiments in animals provide further support for this possibility. In contrast to the effects of a brief course of ACS, postnatal glucocorticoids (PCS), given to preterm infants to reduce the severity of chronic lung disease have been associated with an increased risk of neurologic impairment. Available evidence suggests that PCS does not improve survival. Further study is needed of the neurodevelopmental consequences of both multiple courses of ACS, as well as PCS.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation is an essential event during liver fibrogenesis. A major pathway is the transition of HSCs into hepatic myofibroblasts. The methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 which promotes repressed chromatin structure is selectively detected in myofibroblasts of diseased liver. Overexpression of this protein results in an increase of global methylation levels. Treatment of HSCs with DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) blocks the cell proliferation. 5-azadC also prevents loss of Ras GTPase activating-like protein 1 (RASAL1) expression that occurs during HSCs proliferation. To further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, we hypothesized that this perpetuation of fibrogenesis was caused by DNA methylation. Results demonstrated that hypermethylation of RASAL1 is associated with the perpetuation of fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis in the liver. knockdown of MeCP2 using siRNA technique increased RASAL1 in both mRNA and protein level in myofibroblasts. These studies demonstrated that MeCP2 and DNA methylation may provide molecular mechanisms for perpetuated fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis in the liver.
Prompted by the report of a mitochondrial myopathy associated with chronic administration of zidovudine (AZT), an inhibitor of mitochondrial DNA synthesis, we obtained 31P magnetic resonance spectra from the calf muscles of AZT-treated patients and age-matched control subjects at rest and during an exercise protocol with a 12-second time resolution. The recovery of phosphocreatine following exercise reflects mitochondrial oxidative function and was significantly delayed in the AZT-treated patients (time constants, 43.3 +/- 12.5 seconds versus control subjects, 24.4 +/- 3.9 seconds). These findings support the hypothesis that the myopathy associated with chronic AZT results from the inhibitory effects of AZT on mitochondrial DNA synthesis and, secondarily, on the inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.
The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions for functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) under general anaesthesia during controlled induced hypotension, using either sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or esmolol. Twenty patients, assigned to receive either of the drugs as the primary hypotensive agent, were studied. The same surgeon, blinded to the hypotensive agent used and the haemodynamic variables, performed all the operations. The surgeon used a category scale (0-5) to assess surgical conditions--a value of 2-3 being ideal. Patients were positioned in 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg position and the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was reduced in steps of 5 mmHg. The anaesthetist prompted category scale estimations by the surgeon following a change in any of the haemodynamic variables. Average category scale (ACS) values were compared between the two groups for four data groups, i.e., MABP > 65 mmHg (mild), 60-64 mmHg, 55-59 mmHg and 50-54 mmHg. Pre-treatment MABP was 79.8 +/- 10.4 mmHg in the SNP group and 76.1 +/- 6.8 mmHg in the esmolol group. At mild SNP-induced hypotension, surgical conditions were poor (ACS = 3.63 +/- 0.22; mean +/- SEM), while in the esmolol group, ideal surgical conditions (ACS = 2.94 +/- 0.34) were recorded at MABP > 65 mmHg. The combined effects of increased venous drainage due to the reverse Trendelenburg position, hypotension as well as capillary vasoconstriction due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effect on the mucous membrane vasculature in the esmolol group (as opposed to vasodilatation in the SNP group) probably caused the superior surgical conditions.
Oxidative stress has been suggested as a contributory factor in development and complication of diabetes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of diosmin (DS) in oxidative stress in streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA)-induced diabetic rats by measuring the lipid peroxidation (LPO) as well as the ameliorative properties. Experimental diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of STZ (45 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)) dissolved in 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 4.5), 15 min after the i.p administration of NA (110 mg/kg b.w.). Diabetic rats exhibited increased plasma glucose with significant decrease in plasma insulin levels. The activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the levels of low-molecular weight antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E and reduced glutathione (GSH) were decreased while increases in the levels of LPO markers were observed in liver and kidney tissues of diabetic control rats as compared to normal control rats. Oral treatment with DS (100mg/kg/day) for a period of 45 days showed significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied. Biochemical findings were supported by histological studies. These results indicated that DS has potential ameliorative effects in addition to its antidiabetic effect in type 2 diabetic rats.
Severe childhood malnutrition (SCM) occurs as both oedematous and non-oedematous syndromes. The reasons why some children develop oedematous SCM (OSCM) have remained elusive but differences in clinical presentation among malnourished children from similar backgrounds suggests that there might be inter-individual variation in susceptibility to OSCM.
To estimate the strength of the association between variants of three genes involved in folate/methyl group metabolism [methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)] and risk of OSCM.
Patients previously admitted to the Tropical Metabolism Research Unit (TMRU) for treatment of either OSCM (cases, n = 74) or non-oedematous SCM (NOSCM, controls, n = 50) were recruited. Genotypes at four sites within the three genes (MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G and CBS 844ins68) were determined using PCR-based assays.
The MTHFR 677T [odds ratio (OR) 0.63, 95% CI 0.2-1.7] and MTR 2756G (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.4-1.4) alleles were associated with moderate reduction in risk of OSCM whereas the CBS 844ins68 allele (OR 1.4, 0.7-2.4) was associated with an increased risk. None of these risks was significant at the 5% level.
Genetic variation within folate/methyl group metabolic pathways might have a small but potentially important influence on risk of OSCM. Additional, larger data-sets will be required to test the specific hypotheses (about the putative effect size and direction of association) generated in this preliminary study. Such observations have the potential to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of clinical heterogeneity in severe malnutrition.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to cause gastrointestinal damage. New anti-inflammatory drugs have been developed in an attempt to improve their gastrointestinal side effect profile which however failed to do so. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to compare the effect of three different NSAIDs, aspirin, nimesulide and celecoxib on the intestinal brush border membrane (BBM) marker enzymes and correlate these alterations to the histoarchitecture of the intestine using electron microscopic study. Female Wistar rats were divided into four different groups viz: Group I (Control), Group II (aspirin treated), Group III (nimesulide treated) and Group IV (celecoxib treated). The Group II, III and IV received the corresponding drugs dissolved in water orally at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight, while the control received the vehicle only. After 28 days, all the treatment groups demonstrated significant alterations in the activities of intestinal disaccharide hydrolases and alkaline phosphatase in both the crude homogenates and BBM preparations as well. The histopathological observations also showed considerable changes in the intestinal mucosa. It was suggested that NSAIDs like aspirin, nimesulide and celecoxib pose intestinal side effects due to initial changes in the enzymatic composition of the intestinal apical membranes. It was further concluded that newly discovered NSAIDs such as celecoxib has better safety profiles but studies are still required to comment decisively on the suitability of various NSAIDs depending upon their cyclooxygenase enzyme specificity.
Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common gynecological malignancies worldwide. It is associated with prolonged exposure to estrogens that is unopposed by the protective effects of progesterone, which suggests that altered progesterone biosynthesis, metabolism and actions might be implicated in the development of EC. Our aim was to evaluate these processes through quantitative real-time PCR expression analysis in up to 47 pairs of EC tissue and adjacent control endometrium. First, we examined the expression of genes encoding proteins associated with progesterone biosynthesis: steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR); a side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1); and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/ketosteroid isomerase (HSD3B). There were 1.9- and 10.0-fold decreased expression of STAR and CYP11A1, respectively, in EC versus adjacent control endometrium, with no significant differences in the expression of HSD3B1 and HSD3B2. Next, we examined expression of genes encoding five progesterone metabolizing enzymes: the 3-keto and 20-ketosteroid reductases (AKR1C1-AKR1C3) and 5α-reductases (SRD5A1 and SRD5A2); and the opposing 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B2). These genes are expressed in EC and adjacent control endometrium. No statistically significant differences were seen in mRNA levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3 and SRD5A1. Expression of HSD17B2 was 3.0-fold increased, and expression of SRD5A2 was 3.7-fold decreased, in EC versus adjacent control endometrium. We also examined mRNA levels of progesterone receptors A and B (PGR), and separately the expression of progesterone receptor B (PR-B). Here we saw 1.8- and 2.0-fold lower mRNA levels of PGR and PR-B, respectively, in EC versus adjacent control endometrium. This down-regulation of STAR, CYP11A1 and PGR in endometrial cancer may lead to decreased progesterone biosynthesis and actions although the effects on progesterone levels should be further studied.
A 46-year-old man suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest. Ventricular fibrillation persisted despite 62 minutes of basic and advanced cardiac life support measures in the field. On arrival in the emergency department, he received 4 g magnesium sulfate IV and was defibrillated successfully to normal sinus rhythm with the next countershock. The patient was discharged neurologically intact. We discuss the possible mechanisms of action and clinical use of IV magnesium sulfate in cardiac arrest.
The case of a patient who developed hepatitis during treatment with clofibrate is reported. The first attack of hepatitis, which resolved after the drug was suspended, was followed by another at rechallenge with a similar drug, fenofibrate.
Daily administration of nicotine (0.5 mg/kg per day s.c.) to rats caused a tremor that appeared only in the tail (tail-tremor) and which became more marked over 8 days. Nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors, Nw-nitro-L-arginine (10 mg/kg per day i.p.) or Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (20 and 40 mg/kg per day i.p.), administered each day before nicotine attenuated the development of the tail-tremor. However, neither Nw-nitro-L-arginine (2-10 mg/kg i.p.) nor Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10-40 mg/kg i.p.) affected the tail-tremor that developed after 14 days of repeated nicotine administration. The noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11,-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,b]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate) at 0.2 mg/kg per day (i.p.), or competitive antagonist, CPP (3-[(+/-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl] propyl-1-phosphonic acid) at 2 mg/kg per day (i.p.), administered each day before nicotine attenuated the development of the tail-tremor. MK-801 (0.01-0.2 mg/kg i.p.) but not CPP (0.5-4 mg/kg i.p.) suppressed the tail-tremor that developed after 14 days of repeated nicotine administration. These results suggest that NO formation mediated by NMDA receptors is involved in the mechanisms underlying the tail-tremor induced by the repeated administration of nicotine.
Exposure to cocaine induces selective behavioral and molecular adaptations. In rodents, acute cocaine induces increased locomotor activity, whereas prolonged drug exposure results in behavioral locomotor sensitization, which is thought to be a consequence of drug-induced neuroadaptive changes. Recent attention has been given to compounds activating GABA(B) receptors as potential antiaddictive therapies. In particular, the principle of allosteric positive GABA(B) receptor modulators is very promising in this respect, as positive modulators lack the sedative and muscle relaxant properties of full GABA(B) receptor agonists such as baclofen. Here, we investigated the effects of systemic application of the GABA(B) receptor-positive modulator GS39783 (N,N'-dicyclopentyl-2-methylsulfanyl-5-nitro-pyrimidine-4, 6-diamine) in animals treated with acute and chronic cocaine administration. Both GS39783 and baclofen dose dependently attenuated acute cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion. Furthermore, both compounds also efficiently blocked cocaine-induced Fos induction in the striatal complex. In chronic studies, GS39783 induced a modest attenuation of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Chronic cocaine induces the accumulation of the transcription factor deltaFosB and upregulates cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32). GS39783 blocked the induction/activation of DARPP-32 and CREB in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum and partially inhibited deltaFosB accumulation in the dorsal striatum. In summary, our data provide evidence that GS39783 attenuates the acute behavioral effects of cocaine exposure in rodents and in addition prevents the induction of selective long-term adaptive changes in dopaminergic signaling pathways. Further investigation of GABA(B) receptor-positive modulation as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cocaine dependence and possibly other drugs of abuse is therefore warranted.
Postnatal steroid use decreases lung inflammation but increases impairment. We hypothesized that increased dose is associated with increased neurodevelopmental impairment, lower postmenstrual age at exposure increases impairment, and risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia modifies the effect of postnatal corticosteroid.
Steroid dose and timing of exposure beyond 7 days was assessed among 2358 extremely low birth weight infants nested in a prospective trial, with 1667 (84%) survivors examined at 18 to 22 months' postmenstrual age. Logistic regression tested the relationship between impairment (Bayley Mental Developmental Index/Psychomotor Developmental Index of <70, disabling cerebral palsy, or sensory impairment), total dose (tertiles: <0.9, 0.9-1.9, and >/=1.9 mg/kg), and postmenstrual age at first dose. Separate logistic regression tested effect modification according to bronchopulmonary dysplasia severity (Romagnoli risk > 0.5 as high risk, n = 2336 (99%) for days of life 4-7).
Three hundred sixty-six (16%) neonates were steroid-treated (94% dexamethasone). Treated neonates were smaller and less mature; 72% of those treated were at high risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Exposure was associated with neurodevelopmental impairment/death. Impairment increased with higher dose; 71% dead or impaired at highest dose tertile. Each 1 mg/kg dose was associated with a 2.0-point reduction on the Mental Developmental Index and a 40% risk increase for disabling cerebral palsy. Older age did not mitigate the harm. Treatment after 33 weeks' postmenstrual age was associated with greatest harm despite not receiving the highest dose. The relationship between steroid exposure and impairment was modified by the bronchopulmonary dysplasia risk, with those at highest risk experiencing less harm.
Higher steroid dose was associated with increased neurodevelopmental impairment. There is no "safe" window for steroid use in extremely low birth weight infants. Neonates with low bronchopulmonary dysplasia risk should not be exposed. A randomized trial of steroid use in infants at highest risk is warranted.
To investigate the effect of bacosides (alcoholic extract of brahmi) on scopolamine (3 mg kg(-1), ip), sodium nitrite (75 mg kg(-1), ip) and BN52021 (15 mg kg(-1), ip) induced experimental amnesia in mice, using Morris water maze test, all the agents were administered 30 min before the acquisition trials on each day and repeated for 4 consecutive days, and on 5th day during the retrieval trials. Bacosides on anterograde administration (before training) in mice, significantly decreased the escape latency time (ELT) during the acquisition trials for 4 consecutive days and increased the time spent (TS) in target quadrant during the retrieval trials on 5th day, and on retrograde administration (after training) bacosides were found not to affect TS significantly. Bacosides also significantly decreased the ELT and increased the TS in mice treated anterogradely with scopolamine and sodium nitrite. Bacosides did not exhibit any significant effect on TS of mice treated retrogradely with sodium nitrite. On the other hand, bacosides significantly increased the TS of mice treated retrogradely with BN52021. On the basis of the present results it can be concluded that bacosides facilitate anterograde memory and attenuate anterograde experimental amnesia induced by scopolamine and sodium nitrite possibly by improving acetylcholine level and hypoxic conditions, respectively. Beside this bacosides also reversed BN52021 induced retrograde amnesia, probably due to increase in platelet activating factor (PAF) synthesis by enhancing cerebral glutamate level.
Clinical evidence suggests that deprenyl may slow progression of Parkinson's disease, although mechanisms underlying this putative neuroprotective action remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we studied deprenyl in 12 parkinsonian patients using a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. After 1 month, deprenyl (10 mg/d) decreased the optimal levodopa requirement by 24% (oral) and 16% (intravenous). Levodopa-induced dyskinesias were prolonged by 430%, and antiparkinsonian action by 44%. Mood improved by 47%. One month after withdrawing deprenyl, effects on dyskinesias and mood had yet to return to baseline. There was no change in activities of circulating glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, nor in levels of lipid peroxide and vitamin E. Deprenyl also failed to modify CSF levels of total glutathione and activities of glutathione peroxidase or superoxide dismutase. These effects on levodopa pharmacodynamics and mood complicate the interpretation of available investigations of deprenyl's neuroprotective action and increase the risk of adverse effects of levodopa.
We have investigated the effects of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) fusion gene NPM-RARalpha on the function of PPARgamma using the monoblastic cell line U937. U937 cells were transduced using a retrovirus carrying NPM-RARalpha. While treatment with the synthetic PPARgamma ligand troglitazone (TG) had no effect on the viability of U937 cells, TG treatment of U937/NPM-RARalpha cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell viability, dependent upon both the concentration of TG and the level of expression of NPM-RARalpha. Analysis of the cell cycle profile and flow cytometry with annexin V confirmed that these effects of TG were due to induction of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation, and could be blocked by treatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Cotreatment of U937/NPM-RARalpha cells with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) abrogated the induction of apoptosis by TG. Induction of apoptosis was seen also in the PML-RARalpha-expressing APL cell line NB4, and in several other atRA-sensitive leukemia cell lines, demonstrating that this effect is limited neither to the monocyte lineage nor to the rare NPM-RARalpha fusion variant. RXRalpha/NPM-RARalpha heterodimers were found to interact directly with a PPARgamma-responsive element in vitro. We conclude that in the presence of X-RARalpha, TG induces cell death due to apoptosis via the caspase pathway. These observations suggest the investigation of PPARgamma ligands as therapeutic agents in acute leukemia.
Chemical sympathectomy and bilateral vagotomy were used to evaluate the contribution of each division of the autonomic nervous system in the electrophysiological actions of ouabain. Intact and chemically sympathectomized dogs were given successive and cumulative doses of ouabain until toxicity became manifest (ventricular extrasystoles and (or) ventricular tachycardia). An additional group of normal and sympathectomized animals was also submitted to bilateral vagotomy in the presence of a therapeutic dose of ouabain. Sinus cycle length, AH interval of the His bundle electrogram, atrioventricular junctional effective and functional refractory periods were increased by ouabain at therapeutic doses. These effects were no different in sympathectomized dogs than in intact dogs, indicating the absence of any significant contribution of efferent sympathetic neural activity. However, our results suggested that vagal enhancement was the main mechanism whereby ouabain produced sinus bradycardia and depression of atrioventricular conduction. Sympathectomy with 6-OHDA did not modify nor abolish ouabain toxicity. However, toxic doses were significantly higher in sympathectomized animals than in normal animals. Considering that increasing heart rate by cardiac pacing or vagotomy significantly lowered toxic doses of ouabain in both intact and sympathectomized dogs, it is possible that sympathectomy could influence ouabain toxicity by altering heart rate alone.
