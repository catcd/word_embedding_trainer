Human galactokinase (GALK) is the first enzyme in the Leloir pathway, converting α-d-galactose into galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P). Recently, there is increasing interest in targeting GALK as a novel therapy to ameliorate the disease manifestations in patients with Classic Galactosemia as it would, in combination with (ga-)lactose restriction reduce accumulation of Gal-1-P, a cytotoxic agent. Previously, we identified 34 small molecule compounds that inhibited GALK in vitro using experimental high-throughput screening. In order to isolate useful lead compounds, we characterized these hits with regards to their kinase selectivity profiles, potency and capability to reduce Gal-1-P accumulation in patient cell lines, and their modes of action. We found that the majority of these compounds had IC(50)s ranging from 0.7μM to 33.3μM. When tested against other members of the GHMP kinase family, three compounds (1, 4, and 24) selectively inhibited GALK with high potency. Through alignment of GALK and mevalonate kinase (MVK) crystal structures, we identified that eight amino acid residues and an L1 loop were different within the ATP-binding pockets of these two closely related kinases. By site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we identified one amino acid residue required for the inhibitory function of two of the three selective compounds. Based on these results, we generated binding models of these two compounds using a high-precision docking program. Compounds 4 and 24 inhibited GALK in a mixed model, while compound 1 exhibited parabolic competitive inhibition. Most importantly, using cells from galactosemic patients we found that selected compounds lowered Gal-1-P concentrations.
Sodium fluoride (NaF) is widely used for the treatment of dental caries and dentin hypersensitivity. However, its pro-apoptotic effect on odontoblasts may lead to harmful side-effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pro-apoptotic effects of NaF in odontoblasts and elucidate the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. NaF generated cytotoxic effects in odontoblast-lineage cell (OLC) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Exposure of cells to 4mM NaF for 24h induced caspase-3 activation, ultrastructural alterations, and resulted in the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space into the cytosol, indicating that fluoride-mediated apoptosis is mitochondria-dependent. Fluoride treatment also increased phosphorylation of JNK and ERK, but not p38, and apoptosis induced by fluoride was notably or partly suppressed by treatment with JNK or ERK inhibitors, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that NaF induces apoptosis in OLC odontoblasts through a JNK-dependent mitochondrial pathway.
Bronchial asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and reversible obstruction. Since the gold standard of therapy, a combination of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids and bronchodilatory β(2) agonists, has recently been discussed to be related to an increased mortality, there is a need for novel therapeutic pathways.
A new experimental concept that encompasses the vasoactive intestinal peptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) family of receptors by demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effects of the PACAP receptor 1 (PAC1R) in a murine model of allergic asthma is described.
PAC1R expression was investigated in lung tissue and isolated dendritic cells (DCs) via real-time PCR. Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma models were used in PAC1R-deficient mice and BALB/c mice treated with PAC1R agonist maxadilan (MAX). Bronchoalveolar lavages have been performed and investigated at the cellular and cytokine levels. Fluorescence staining of a frozen lung section has been performed to detect eosinophil granulocytes in lung tissue. Plasma IgE levels have been quantified via the ELISA technique. Lung function was determined using head-out body plethysmography or whole-body plethysmography.
Increased PAC1R mRNA expression in lung tissue was present under inflammatory conditions. PAC1R expression was detected on DCs. In OVA-induced asthma models, which were applied to PAC1R-deficient mice (PAC1R(-/-)) and to BALB/c mice treated with the specific PAC1R agonist MAX, PAC1R deficiency resulted in inflammatory effects, while agonistic stimulation resulted in anti-inflammatory effects. No effects on lung function were detected both in the gene-depletion and in the pharmacologic studies. In summary, here, we demonstrate that anti-inflammatory effects can be achieved via PAC1R.
PAC1R agonists may represent a promising target for an anti-inflammatory therapy in airway diseases such as bronchial asthma.
To test the carcinostatic effects of ascorbic acid, we challenged the mice of seven experimental groups with 1.7 x 10(-4) mol high dose concentration ascorbic acid after intraperitoneal administrating them with sarcoma S-180 cells. The survival rate was increased by 20% in the group that received high dose concentration ascorbic acid, compared to the control. The highest survival rate was observed in the group in which 1.7 x 10(-4) mol ascorbic acid had been continuously injected before and after the induction of cancer cells, rather than just after the induction of cancer cells. The expression of three angiogenesis-related genes was inhibited by 0.3 times in bFGF, 7 times in VEGF and 4 times in MMP2 of the groups with higher survival rates. Biopsy Results, gene expression studies, and wound healing analysis in vivo and in vitro suggested that the carcinostatic effect induced by high dose concentration ascorbic acid occurred through inhibition of angiogenesis.
The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain.
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7.
The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]).
Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.
Retrospective studies of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain suggest that a strategy of discharging patients from the emergency department after a 12-hour observation period if they do not have evidence of ischemia should be associated with a very low rate of complications.
We prospectively evaluated the safety of a 9-to-12-hour observation period in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who were at low-to-intermediate risk of cardiovascular events. Consecutive patients who reported or tested positive for cocaine use and who received protocol-driven care in a chest-pain observation unit were included. Patients who had normal levels of troponin I, without new ischemic changes on electrocardiography, and who had no cardiovascular complications (dysrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, or recurrent symptoms) during the 9-to-12-hour observation period were discharged from the unit. The main outcome was death from cardiovascular causes at 30 days.
Three hundred forty-four patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. Forty-two of these patients (12 percent) were directly admitted to the hospital. The study cohort comprised the remaining 302 patients. During the 30-day follow-up period, none of the patients died of a cardiovascular event (0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 0.99), and only 4 of the 256 patients for whom detailed follow-up data were available had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 3.1). All four nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred in patients who continued to use cocaine.
Patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who do not have evidence of ischemia or cardiovascular complications over a 9-to-12-hour period in a chest-pain observation unit have a very low risk of death or myocardial infarction during the 30 days after discharge.
Indinavir sulfate has been reported to cause asymptomatic crystalluria and nephrolithiasis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Patients taking indinavir may present with asymptomatic crystalluria, nephrolithiasis with frank renal colic and obstruction, flank pain in the absence of nephrolithiasis, and dysuria or urgency. Asymptomatic crystalluria has been described as benign. Discontinuation of the drug has not been recommended in the absence of nephrolithiasis. We report two HIV-positive patients receiving indinavir who developed acute interstitial nephritis with foreign body giant cell reaction on renal biopsies. Both patients had asymptomatic crystalluria, although crystals were associated with clumps of white blood cells (WBCs) on urinalysis in one patient. Both cases show that the inflammatory response was significant enough to lead to tubular injury and acute renal impairment. Our findings suggest that asymptomatic crystalluria attributable to indinavir may illicit an inflammatory response with acute renal insufficiency, warranting monitoring of renal function, especially in patients with crystalluria.
The nonsteroidal synthetic estrogen hexestrol (HES), which is diethylstilbestrol hydrogenated at the C-3-C-4 double bond, is carcinogenic. Its major metabolite is the catechol, 3'-OH-HES, which can be metabolically converted to the catechol quinone, HES-3',4'-Q. Study of HES was undertaken with the scope to substantiate evidence that natural catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones are endogenous carcinogenic metabolites. HES-3',4'-Q was previously shown to react with deoxyguanosine to form the depurinating adduct 3'-OH-HES-6'-N7Gua by 1,4-Michael addition [Jan S-T, Devanesan PD, Stack DE, Ramanathan R, Byun J, Gross ML, et al. Metabolic activation and formation of DNAadducts of hexestrol,a synthetic nonsteroidal carcinogenic estrogen. Chem Res Toxicol 1998;11:412-9.]. We report here formation of the depurinating adduct 3'-OH-HES-6'-N3Ade by reaction of HES-3',4'-Q with Ade by 1,4-Michael addition. The structure of the N3Ade adduct was established by NMR and MS. We also report here formation of the depurinating 3'-OH-HES-6'-N7Gua and 3'-OH-HES-6'-N3Ade adducts by reaction of HES-3',4'-Q with DNA or by activation of 3'-OH-HES by tyrosinase, lactoperoxidase, prostaglandin H synthase or 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rat liver microsomes in the presence of DNA. The N3Ade adduct was released instantaneously from DNA, whereas the N7Gua adduct was released with a half-life of approximately 3 h. Much lower (<1%) levels of unidentified stable adducts were detected in the DNA from these reactions. These results are similar to those obtained by reaction of endogenous catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones with DNA. The similarities extend to the instantaneously-depurinating N3Ade adducts and relatively slowly-depurinating N7Gua adducts. The endogenous estrogens, estrone and estradiol, their 4-catechol estrogens and HES are carcinogenic in the kidney of Syrian golden hamsters. These results suggest that estrone (estradiol)-3,4-quinones and HES-3',4'-Q are the ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of the natural and synthetic estrogens, respectively. Reaction of the electrophilic quinones by 1,4-Michael addition with DNA at the nucleophilic N-3 of Ade and N-7 of Gua is suggested to be the major critical step in tumor initiation by these compounds.
To evaluate in vitro antitumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, and investgate the relationship with expression of hTERT mRNA in human gastric cancer tissues.
Fresh samples of gastric cancer obtained from operation room were prepared to single-cell suspension (3 x 10(5) to 5 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and were separately exposed to taxol (TAX), cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), adriamycin (ADM), mitomycin (MMC) for 48 hours. Metabolic activity and inhibitory rate of the cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion and MTT assay. Expression of hTERT mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization (ISH).
The inhibition rate of cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic drugs was different, and that of TAX, CDDP, 5-Fu was significantly higher than that of ADM and MMC. The positive rate of hTERT mRNA expression was 90.0% (54/60) and positive cells showed resistance to 5-Fu and ADM.
Overexpression of hTERT mRNA may contribute to primary drug-resistance of tumors. Chemosensitivity tests by MTT assay may contribute to prediction of effectness in applying chemotherapeutic drugs and identify drug-resistant cases.
The cytotoxic activity of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent ibuprofen to human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, its multidrug-resistant subline HL-60/VCR (MDR-1 gene coded P-glycoprotein), as well as myeloma U266 and B-lymphoblastoid ARH-77 cell lines was demonstrated with the aid of flow cytometric analysis. Ibuprofen inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis (detected as sub-G0 nuclei, fluorescein diacetate staining, Annexin-V binding cells and agarose electrophoretic detection of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation) in promyelocytic cells and, to a lesser extent, in U266 and ARH-77 cells.
During the past few decades, suggestive evidence has been accumulated that abnormalities in serotonin neurotransmission are involved in the pathogenesis of aggressive behaviour disorders and impulsivity. Support for this idea can be derived from clinical studies using 5-HT1 agonistic compounds and serotonergic antidepressants. In the present study, the efficacy of the 5-HT1a agonist buspirone was investigated in eight patients with mental retardation and severe, long-lasting challenging behaviour, characterized by aggressive outbursts, self-injurious behaviour and impulsivity. The findings demonstrate that buspirone, in a daily dosage varying between 20 and 50 mg, may be effective in reducing this type of behavioural disturbance and associated with an improvement in sociability. It is hypothesized that the responsiveness to buspirone treatment may be the result of a de-arousing phenomenon, mediated via corticosteroid dependent stress homeostatic mechanisms.
Currently, the anticoagulants available are limited to warfarin, heparin compounds, and direct thrombin inhibitors. Warfarin, the most commonly used outpatient anticoagulant, has significant shortcomings. There are numerous drug/drug and drug/food interactions, and there is difficulty in dosing for one-third of patients. Numerous new anticoagulants are undergoing testing. The meta-pentasaccharides use the core molecule of heparin and replace one or more of the sulphated groups. They are administered by subcutaneous injection, but they require only once per week dosing. Numerous studies have shown equivalents or superiority to warfarin in treatment for thromboembolic events. Direct thrombin inhibitors block thrombin (IIa) and are used mostly for heparin-induced thrombosis or during coronary interventions. However, there is an orally administered direct thrombin inhibitor, Dabigatran, which is undergoing phase III testing. It can be given without regard to weight, age, or gender with minimal drug interactions. This drug has been proven to be equivalent to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and showed no excess bleeding. Another promising group of anticoagulants with numerous investigations underway are the direct X inhibitors. Most are excreted renally as opposed to hepatic clearance with intravenous or oral dosing. Numerous phase II studies have shown them to have equivalent or superior prophylaxis for DVT when compared with LMWH. Oral IXa inhibitors and an oral thrombin cofactor inhibitor are also under development. It is clear that in the near future, anticoagulants will be available that offer significant advantages when compared to those currently in use.
To ascertain the early pathophysiological features in canine renal papillary necrosis (RPN) caused by the neurotransmission enhancer nefiracetam, male beagle dogs were orally administered nefiracetam at 300 mg/kg/day for 4 to 7 weeks in comparison with ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), at 50 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks. During the dosing period, the animals were periodically subjected to laboratory tests, light-microscopic, immunohistochemical, and electron-microscopic examinations and/or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA analysis. In laboratory tests, a decrease in urinary osmotic pressure and increases in urine volume and urinary lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level were early biomarkers for detecting RPN. Light-microscopically, nefiracetam revealed epithelial swelling and degeneration in the papillary ducts in week 7, while ibuprofen displayed degeneration and necrosis in the papillary interstitium in week 5. In immunohistochemical staining with COX-2 antibody, nefiracetam elicited a positive reaction within interstitial cells around the affected epithelial cells in the papillary ducts (upper papilla) in week 7, and ibuprofen positively reacted within interstitial cells adjacent to the degenerative and/or necrotic lesions in week 5. Ultrastructurally, nefiracetam exhibited reductions of intracellular interdigitation and infoldings of epithelial cells in the papillary ducts, whereas ibuprofen showed no changes in the identical portions. Thus, the early morphological change in the papilla brought about by nefiracetam was quite different from that elicited by ibuprofen. By the renal papillary COX-2 mRNA expression analysis, nefiracetam exceedingly decreased its expression in week 4, but markedly increased it in week 7, suggesting an induction of COX-2 mRNA by renal papillary lesions. These results demonstrate that the epithelial cell in the papillary ducts is the primary target site for the onset of RPN evoked by nefiracetam.
Niacin is an agent that significantly increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), but its effects on surrogate markers of atherosclerosis and inflammatory markers are less clear. We studied the effects of niacin on carotid intimal media thickness (IMT), brachial artery reactivity as well as markers of inflammation and the metabolic profile of patients with metabolic syndrome.
Fifty patients with the metabolic syndrome (Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria) were randomised to either extended-release niacin (1000 mg/day) or placebo. After 52 weeks of treatment, there was a change of carotid IMT of +0.009 +/- 0.003 mm in the placebo group and -0.005 +/- 0.002 mm in the niacin group (p = 0.021 between groups). Endothelial function improved by 22% in the group treated with niacin (p < 0.001), whereas no significant changes were seen in the placebo group. High sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased by 20% in the group treated with niacin for 52 weeks (p = 0.013). Niacin increased HDL-C (p < 0.001) and decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (p < 0.001) significantly, and there were no adverse effects on fasting glucose levels after 52 weeks of treatment.
Extended-release niacin therapy effects a regression in carotid intimal medial thickness and improvement in metabolic parameters (increased HDL and reduced triglycerides). Furthermore, extended-release niacin may demonstrate an anti-atherogenic effect in the metabolic syndrome by improving endothelial function and decreasing vascular inflammation.
Cadmium (Cd) is one of the environmental pollutants affecting various tissues and organs including testis. Harmful effect of Cd in testis is known to be germ cell degeneration and impairment of testicular steroidogenesis. Animals treated with high doses of Cd (0.2 and 0.3 mg/100g BW) showed a significant decrease in serum testosterone (T) level, but a significant induction of testicular lipid peroxidation levels. TUNEL assay showed that low doses of Cd (0.13 and 0.15 mg/100g BW) exhibited typical characteristics of apoptosis while high doses of Cd caused more necrosis than apoptosis. In contrast, supplementation with ascorbic acid reduced testicular lipid peroxidation levels. Ascorbic acid supplementation restored testicular 3beta-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase (HSD) and 17beta-HSD enzyme activities, 3beta-HSD and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450(scc)) mRNA levels and serum T concentration to normal in Cd-administered rats. Moreover, administration of ascorbic acid prevented germ cell apoptosis as demonstrated by the reduced number of TUNEL-positive cells in germinal epithelium and inhibited Cd-induced necrosis. These results indicate that ascorbic acid have protective roles in vivo on the Cd-induced overall testicular damage including impaired steroidogenesis and germ cell death possibly through scavenging the reactive oxygen species generated by Cd administration.
The contents of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), dopamine (DA), normetanephrine (NMN), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG) were measured in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 66 patients with primary hypertension and 24 patients with normal blood pressure and minor neurological disorders. Plasma and CSF NE and NMN concentrations were raised in the hypertensive patients. The plasma and CSF NE levels and arterial blood pressure of a small subset of hypertensive patients were normalized after clonidine therapy. In hypertensive patients the content of DA was lower and the ratio of NE/DA was greater; CSF and plasma NE contents were related to the level of arterial blood pressure; and the content of MHPG in CSF was linked strongly with NE content in plasma and CSF and to the level of arterial blood pressure. Thus both central sympathetic nerve tone and peripheral sympathetic nerve tone were enhanced in young patients with uncomplicated hypertension. The elevated levels of neurohormones and their metabolites in some patients with primary hypertension may be related to increased synthesis and release of neural NE and may be pathogenic in the blood pressure elevation.
Intervention trials have shown the beneficial effects of chromium supplementation in type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). This study investigated the effects of chromium picolinate on elderly diabetic patients within a rehabilitation program. Thirty-nine diabetic subjects, average age 73 years (18 males and 21 females), undergoing rehabilitation following stroke or hip fracture, were recruited to participate in this study. An additional 39 diabetic patients constituted the control group. Along with standard treatment for diabetes, the study group received 200 microg of chromium twice a day for a three-week period. Blood samples, dietary intake, and anthropometric data were collected prior to and post-intervention. Throughout the study period, participants received a diet of approximately 1500 kcal/day. Significant differences in the fasting blood level of glucose compared to the baseline (190 mg/dL vs 150 mg/dL, p < 0.001) were found at the end of the study. HbA1c also improved from 8.2% to 7.6% (p < 0.01). Total cholesterol was also reduced from 235 mg/dL to 213 mg/dL (p < 0.02). A trend towards lowered triglyceride levels was also observed (152 mg/dL vs 136 mg/dL). We conclude that, in this population of elderly, diabetic patients undergoing rehabilitation, dietary supplementation with chromium is beneficial in moderating glucose intolerance. In addition, chromium intake appears to lower plasma lipid levels.
Triptolide (TP), a major active ingredient extracted from the widely used Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f. (TWHF), has been demonstrated to possess various biological activities. However, the clinical applications of TP are limited by its narrow therapeutic window and severe toxicity. The current study aimed to investigate the roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria in TP-induced cardiac injury. Male BALB/C mice were intravenously (i.v.) treated with a single dose of TP (1.2 mg/kg). After 24h, TP induced the oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptotic damage, and pathological changes of heart tissue. In vitro studies also indicated that the cytotoxic effects of TP involved the ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway in H9c2 cells. TP treatment increased the accumulation of ROS and subsequently triggered cell apoptosis by depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), reduced the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, released cytochrome c and, ultimately, activated caspase-3. Nrf2, as well as its downstream antioxidants, were also suppressed by TP. Taken together, these results suggest that TP induces cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro via oxidative stress, which was associated with down regulated Nrf2 activation, and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway.
The tumor-promoting effects of oxfendazole (OX), a benzimidazole anthelmintic, were investigated using a medium-term rat hepatocarcinogenesis model. Six-week-old male F344 rats received an intraperitoneal injection of N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and were given a powdered diet containing 0 or 500 ppm OX for 6 weeks from 2 weeks after DEN treatment. All animals were subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy 1 week after OX treatment. The numbers and areas of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci were significantly increased in the livers of rats treated with OX, with concomitantly increased cell proliferation, compared with those in the livers of the DEN alone group. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OX induced not only mRNA expression of phase I enzymes Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, but also Nrf2-regulated phase II enzymes such as Gpx2, Nqo1, Yc2, Akr7a3 and Gstm1, presumably due to an adaptive response against OX-induced oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species production increased in microsomes isolated from the livers of OX-treated rats. Furthermore, OX enhanced oxidative DNA damage (as assessed by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine; 8-OHdG) and lipid peroxidation (as assessed by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances; TBARS). These results suggest that administration of OX at a high dose and for a long term enhances oxidative stress responses, which may contribute to its tumor-promoting potential in rats.
Heat stroke (HS) is a life-threatening illness induced by prolonged exposure to a hot environment that causes central nervous system abnormalities and severe hyperthermia. Current data suggest that the pathophysiological responses to heat stroke may not only be due to the immediate effects of heat exposure per se but also the result of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The observation that pro- (e.g., IL-1) and anti-inflammatory (e.g., IL-10) cytokines are elevated concomitantly during recovery suggests a complex network of interactions involved in the manifestation of heat-induced SIRS. In this study, we measured a set of circulating cytokine/soluble cytokine receptor proteins and liver cytokine and receptor mRNA accumulation in wild-type and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor knockout mice to assess the effect of neutralization of TNF signaling on the SIRS following HS. Using a systems approach, we developed a computational model describing dynamic changes (intra- and extracellular events) in the cytokine signaling pathways in response to HS that was fitted to novel genomic (liver mRNA accumulation) and proteomic (circulating cytokines and receptors) data using global optimization. The model allows integration of relevant biological knowledge and formulation of new hypotheses regarding the molecular mechanisms behind the complex etiology of HS that may serve as future therapeutic targets. Moreover, using our unique modeling framework, we explored cytokine signaling pathways with three in silico experiments (e.g. by simulating different heat insult scenarios and responses in cytokine knockout strains in silico).
Neural tube defects were induced dose-dependently by single injections of the anticonvulsant drug valproic acid (VPA) as sodium salt in mice on gestational day 8. Folinic acid (5-CHO-THF) coadministration by i.p. injection or by a constant rate infusion via osmotic minipumps, implanted s.c., significantly reduced the exencephaly rates using a randomized double-blind experimental procedure. 5-CHO-THF supplementation cut the exencephaly rates into half even at high maternal plasma levels of VPA (p less than 0.005, chi 2-test); resorption rates were not affected. The VPA plasma kinetics were not changed by any of the application regimens of 5-CHO-THF. The investigation of the folate metabolite pattern (determined by HPLC) showed that 5-CHO-THF and 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid (5-CH3-THF) were the main metabolites in untreated mice. After supplementation with 5-CHO-THF, only the concentrations of this folate vitamer were increased in the plasma from 0.3 microgram/ml (normal) to 0.6 or 1.9 micrograms/ml (after injection of 3 x 1 mg/kg or 3 X 4 mg/kg) and to 4.2 micrograms/ml (after infusion via osmotic minipumps). Our results indicate that VPA-induced exencephaly in mice combined with the investigation of the plasma levels of VPA and the different folate metabolites could be an appropriate animal model to study protective effects of folates on the occurrence of neural tube defects.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a glycolipid component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria can elicit a systemic inflammatory process leading to septic shock and death. Acute phase response is characterized by fever, leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, altered metabolic responses and redox balance by inducing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4' trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol exhibiting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated the protective effect of resveratrol on endotoxemia-induced acute phase response in rats. When acutely administered by i.p. route, resveratrol (40 mg/kg b.w.) counteracted the effect of a single injection of LPS (4 mg/kg b.w.) which induced fever, a decrease in white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT) counts. When i.p. administered during 7 days at 20 mg/kg per day (subacute treatment), resveratrol abrogated LPS-induced erythrocytes lipoperoxidation and catalase (CAT) activity depression to control levels. In the plasma compartment, LPS increased malondialdehyde (MDA) via nitric monoxide (NO) elevation and decreased iron level. All these deleterious LPS effects were reversed by a subacute resveratrol pre-treatment via a NO independent way. Resveratrol exhibited potent protective effect on LPS-induced acute phase response in rats.
Indomethacin caused maximum stomach ulceration in mice on the 3rd day, which was associated with reduction of plasma total antioxidant status (TAS), COX-1, COX-2, mucosal PGE(2), VEGF, and vWF, along with an increase in endostatin levels. Treatment with the phytochemical allylpyrocatechol (5 mg/kg, p.o. for 3 days) provided significant ulcer healing by reversing these biochemical parameters, as well as increasing the EGF expression more than that observed due to ulceration. Omeprazole (3 mg/kg, p.o. for 3 days) provided a similar healing by improving TAS and mucin levels, without significantly altering the other parameters.
Benzotrichloride and benzoyl chloride are suspected to be causative agents of lung cancer and maxillary malignant lymphoma of workers employed in factories producing benzoyl chloride. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the carcinogenicity in mice of inhaling benzotrichloride and benzoyl chloride. Mice inhaled benzotrichloride and benzoyl chloride vapor for 30 min/d for 2 d/wk for 5 months, and each animal was followed for several month without subsequent exposure. Tumor developed in the lung, skin and lymphatic tissues at high incidences in mice inhaling benzotrichloride. By benzotrichloride vaporized at 50 degrees C, the incidence of pulmonary tumors was 53.1% (17/32, p less than 0.001), that of skin tumors was 25% (8/32, p less than 0.02), and that of malignant lymphoma was 25% (8/32, p less than 0.02) observed at the 10th month after exposure. These are significantly higher than that observed in control mice. In mice exposed to benzotrichloride vaporized at room temperature, the incidence of pulmonary tumors was 81.1% (30/37), that of skin tumors was 27.0% (10/37), and that of malignant lymphoma was 10.8% (4/37) observed at the 15th month after exposure. On the other hand, by benzoyl chloride vaporized at 50 degrees C, the incidence of pulmonary tumors was 10.7% (3/28) and that of skin tumors was 7.1% (2/28), but these incidences did not show any significant difference from the controls. These results suggest that the carcinogenicity of benzotrichloride is much higher than benzoyl chloride and that benzotrichloride is the primary cause of malignancies developing among workers engaged in manufacturing benzoyl chloride.
