The administration of N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide FANFT) by gavage to female NMRI-mice resulted in a high incidence of neoplasms of the forestomach. From 117 effective animals which were pooled from 3 dosed groups, 30 squamous cell carcinomas and 26/117 papillomas of the forestomach were diagnosed. Only 5/117 neoplasms of the urinary bladder occurred. The average cumulative dose administered was 1180 mg/mouse, and the mean latent period for the induction of forestomach tumours was 574 days. The mode of application seems to be an important factor in the carcinogenicity of FANFT.
Methamphetamine (METH) damages dopamine (DA) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated. Cardona et al. [Nat. Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP-induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons. Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation. Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity. METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation. This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH. We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation. Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.
In epileptic patients, neurobehavioral problems such as cognitive impairment, depression, and psychosocial impairments have been described, which may have a pathological and/or iatrogenic basis. For this reason additional treatment is required, beside antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, to correct the accompanying neurological deficits. However, the rationale behind use of antidepressants along with antiepileptics has been questioned due to proconvulsant effects of the former. In the present study, the effect of gabapentin (GBP) on seizure score and memory is evaluated when it is given alone and in combination with some antidepressants, such as sertraline (SERTR) and alprazolam (ALP). Pentetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsion and spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) models were used to study the anticonvulsant effect and effect on memory, respectively. Results showed that addition of SERT to GBP or ALP resulted in reduction of anticonvulsant efficacy of these drugs. However, the combination of GBP + SERT + ALP was superior as far as effect on seizure severity and memory was concerned.
To assess patients' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with propofol, and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring.
This was a prospective, single-intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003. BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status. At 1-minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator. The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient's ability to repeat the word were recorded. After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed.
Seventy-five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation. No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations. The mean (+/-standard deviation) time of data collection was 16.4 minutes (+/-7.1; range 5 to 34 minutes). The mean initial (preprocedure) BIS score was 97.1 (+/-2.3; range 92 to 99). The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66.9 (+/-14.4; range 33 to 91). The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77.1 (95% CI = 74.3 to 80.0). The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81.5 (95% CI = 78.1 to 84.8). The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96.7 (+/-2.4; range 84 to 98). The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91.2 (95% CI = 88.1 to 94.3). All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol. The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91.5 (+/-11.1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90.
There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words. Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of retrograde amnesia.
The aim of this study was to document a case of tamoxifen-associated extensive pelvic endometriosis and attract the attention to this side effect of tamoxifen use in the postmenopausal patient. A 74-year-old woman with a history of breast carcinoma who received tamoxifen therapy for 2 years was admitted with uterine bleeding. Hysteroscopic polypectomy revealed a hyperplastic polyp. Extensive pelvic endometriosis was detected at the operation and due to dense adhesions, subtotal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. The patient continued to use tamoxifen. A supracervical pelvic mass was detected 14 months later. The cervix, rectum, and the accompanying mass were resected. Histopathologic examination revealed endocervical adenocarcinoma and endometriosis involving cervix uteri and the rectal muscular wall. The patient had two normal cervical smears within the last 3 years and no abnormal appearance was detected within the cervical canal in the hysteroscopic examination. As cervical cancer occurred in a short period, it might be speculated that tamoxifen might have stimulated the proliferative and mitotic activity of cervical endometrial tissue which has progressed into invasive cancer in time.
Assessing the relative value of cocaine and how it changes with chronic drug use represents a long-standing goal in addiction research. Surprisingly, recent experiments in rats--by far the most frequently used animal model in this field--suggest that the value of cocaine is lower than previously thought.
Here we report a series of choice experiments that better define the relative position of cocaine on the value ladder of rats (i.e., preference rank-ordering of different rewards). Rats were allowed to choose either taking cocaine or drinking water sweetened with saccharin--a nondrug alternative that is not biologically essential. By systematically varying the cost and concentration of sweet water, we found that cocaine is low on the value ladder of the large majority of rats, near the lowest concentrations of sweet water. In addition, a retrospective analysis of all experiments over the past 5 years revealed that no matter how heavy was past cocaine use most rats readily give up cocaine use in favor of the nondrug alternative. Only a minority, fewer than 15% at the heaviest level of past cocaine use, continued to take cocaine, even when hungry and offered a natural sugar that could relieve their need of calories.
This pattern of results (cocaine abstinence in most rats; cocaine preference in few rats) maps well onto the epidemiology of human cocaine addiction and suggests that only a minority of rats would be vulnerable to cocaine addiction while the large majority would be resilient despite extensive drug use. Resilience to drug addiction has long been suspected in humans but could not be firmly established, mostly because it is difficult to control retrospectively for differences in drug self-exposure and/or availability in human drug users. This conclusion has important implications for preclinical research on the neurobiology of cocaine addiction and for future medication development.
Dynamic cardiomyoplasty is being used clinically worldwide, and evaluated by a clinical trial (phase III) in the United States. Some centers stimulate the skeletal muscle wrap with every heart beat (1:1 [muscle:heart]), whereas others use every other heart beat (1:2). Recent concern over the possible deleterious effects of too-frequent stimulation of the muscles motivated the attempt to evaluate, in a canine model of chronic, double cardiomyoplasty, the effects of two different pacing ratios on several hemodynamic parameters of interest.
Double cardiomyoplasty was performed using both latissimus dorsi muscles in 11 dogs. Fatigue resistance was achieved using the clinical transformation protocol. At a final experiment, acute cardiac failure was induced by administration of propranolol. Hemodynamic measurements of eight physiologic variables were averaged over complete pacing cycles, including the nonpaced beat at a 1:2 pacing ratio.
The net effects of latissimus dorsi muscle stimulation at each of two pacing ratios were compared using nonparametric statistics. With the exception of left ventricular pressure (p = 0.0262) and its first derivative, dP/dt (p = 0.0099), there was no significant difference between hemodynamic performance at the two pacing ratios.
In this canine model, pacing every other beat produces hemodynamic results that are statistically similar to pacing every beat. Less frequent stimulation of the latissimus dorsi muscle may preserve its function and improve clinical results without compromising hemodynamic benefit.
Increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defense mechanism are important factors in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes mellitus and other oxidant-related diseases. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible protective effects of S-allyl cysteine (SAC) against oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. SAC was administered orally for 45 days to control and STZ induced diabetic rats. The effects of SAC on glucose, plasma insulin, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), hydroperoxide, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and GSH/GSSG ratio were studied. The levels of glucose, TBARS, hydroperoxide, and GSSG were increased significantly whereas the levels of plasma insulin, reduced glutathione, GSH/GSSG ratio, superoxide dismutase, catalase and GPx were decreased in STZ induced diabetic rats. Administration of SAC to diabetic rats showed a decrease in plasma glucose, TBARS, hydroperoxide and GSSG. In addition, the levels of plasma insulin, superoxide dismutase, catalase, GPx and reduced glutathione (GSH) were increased in SAC treated diabetic rats. The above findings were supported by histological observations of the liver and kidney. The antioxidant effect of SAC was compared with glyclazide, a well-known antioxidant and antihyperglycemic drug. The present study indicates that the SAC possesses a significant favorable effect on antioxidant defense system in addition to its antidiabetic effect.
A postoperative cardiac surgical patient developed ventricular fibrillation immediately after accidental pericardial injection of bupivacaine at room temperature. The possible causes, which include systemic toxicity, local vasoconstriction with myocardial ischaemia, local toxic effect of bupivacaine or local hypothermia, are discussed.
One normal human lymphoid cell line was treated continuously with the fungicide Folpet (N-trichloromethylthio-phthalimide) at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 microgram/ml of media and one Burkitt cell line was pulse-treated with the same compound for 15 min at 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 microgram/ml. Various times after treatment, cell viability counts and chromosomes analyses were made. Severe cell growth inhibition and an increase in chromosome aberrations were observed in both cell lines. There were two types of induced chromosome aberrations. Aberrations type A appeared in cultures treated with lower doses and were characterized by chromosome or chromatid gaps and breaks and also infrequently seen exchanges and dicentrics. In the later stages of the experiment, the rate of growth and aberrations returned to control levels. Chromosome aberrations type B appeared in early samples of cultures treated with higher doses. The whole complement of chromosomes was affected. The aberrations included chromosome stickiness, despiralization and pulverization. The cultures died off within two days.
Amphetamines are central nervous system stimulants with high abuse potential and intense physiological and psychological effects. Abuse of methamphetamine--a methyl derivative of amphetamine--has grown to epidemic proportions across the United States. Due to the characteristic signs of methamphetamine abuse that appear in the oral cavity dentists should have a heightened awareness of the medical and dental issues surrounding this dangerous behavior. Moreover, recognition and proper referral to treatment should be a part of every provider's plan for preventing the devastating psychological, oral, and overall systemic effects of methamphetamine abuse.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether cocaine use is a significant prognostic factor for outcome measures such as Hunt and Hess grade and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score among patients presenting with ruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs).
The authors performed a MEDLINE/PubMed search for cases of ruptured IAs associated with cocaine use. Fourteen cases from the authors' experience were combined with 50 from a literature review, for a total of 64 cases associated with cocaine use. These 64 cases were compared with 65 cases without cocaine use (controls), which had been obtained from an aneurysm database. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine significant prognostic factors for a poor Hunt and Hess grade and a poor GOS score, and a general linear model was applied to identify significant factors for these measures among cocaine users.
There were 40 women in each group. The mean age was 32.3 +/- 8.1 years in the cocaine group and 49.7 +/- 10.6 years in the control group; thus, patients in the cocaine group were significantly younger (p < 0.01). Cocaine was snorted in 21% of cases, smoked in 55%, and intravenously injected or taken in through a combination of routes in 24%. Fifty-one percent of cocaine users and 7.7% of nonusers presented with a poor GOS score (p < 0.01). Fifty-six percent had ictus during cocaine abuse. At the end of a 30-day follow-up, 51% of the patients in the cocaine group had a good GOS score compared with 92% in the control group (p < 0.01). Controlling for the effects of other significant factors, cocaine use had a significant effect on Hunt and Hess grade (p < 0.03) and GOS score (p < 0.01). The odds of having a poor Hunt and Hess grade among cocaine users were 4.2 times greater than those in nonusers, and the odds of having a poor GOS score among cocaine users were 38.8 times greater.
Aneurysms were significantly smaller and ruptured at a younger age among cocaine users compared with nonusers. Although the poor clinical grade was not significantly different between the 2 groups, outcome was significantly worse in cocaine users.
Eating-induced seizures are an uncommon presentation of reflex epilepsy, a condition characterized by seizures provoked by specific stimuli. Most reports have identified aetiology associated with malformations of cortical developmental, hypoxic brain injury, previous meningoencephalitis or static encephalopathy. We present a patient with eating-induced reflex seizures, which began several years after treatment for an opercular primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), and who subsequently underwent in-depth clinical and video-EEG analysis for her seizures. This patient noted rapid improvement with decreased frequency of seizure activity after treatment with valproic acid. We discuss the aetiology of reflex epilepsy, the anatomical basis of eating-induced epilepsy, and review the current literature.
To clarify whether the ovaries have a potential to attenuate the aggravating effect of testosterone (T) on glomerular injury, we investigated the effect of T in female rats with or without ovaries, using Adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Group 1 consisted of female control rats, group 2 received T, groups 3 and 4 were subjected to ovariectomy (OVX) at 5 weeks of age, and group 4 received further T treatment. Group 5 consisted of male control rats. T was injected subcutaneously every 4 weeks from 5 weeks of age through the end of the experiment. ADR 2 mg/kg was administered intravenously to all rats twice, at 8 weeks of age and 20 days later. Body weight, blood pressure, urinary protein and serum constituents were investigated every 4 weeks from 4 through 24 weeks after the second ADR injection. Each group was studied morphologically 24 weeks after the second ADR injection. Treatment with T or with OVX and T significantly increased the urinary protein excretion. OVX had no significant effect on the urinary protein excretion. Treatment with either T or OVX did not induce any significant effects on the renal function with regard to blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr) and Cr clearance (Ccr) levels, but a combined treatment with OVX and T significantly lowered the serum albumin levels, increased the levels of BUN and Cr and lowered the Ccr values. The glomerulosclerosis index was significantly and markedly higher in control male rats than in control females. Treatment with T resulted in a slight but significant increase in glomerular injury to levels similar to those seen in ovariectomized rats. Combined treatment with OVX and T significantly aggravated glomerular injury in a somewhat accelerated manner, associated with a significant increase in glomerular tuft volume. Our results suggested that the ovaries could not completely suppress glomerular injury worsened by T administered at serum levels similar to those of male rats, but they had a potential to attenuate glomerular injury induced by T, and the protective effect of the ovaries on glomerular injury may be related to their attenuating effect on glomerular growth.
Women with breast carcinoma and four or more involved ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive an induction course and 2 yr of maintenance chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF, 150 patients), CMF plus vincristine and prednisone (CMFVP, 166 patients), or chemoimmunotherapy with CMF plus the methanol extraction residue of BCG (CMF-MER, 85 patients). After 5 yr of accrual and a median follow-up of 34 mo, CMFVP is superior to CMF (p less than 0.01) with disease-free survival estimates at 4 yr of 60% for CMFVP compared to 45% for CMF. The disease-free survival advantage of CMFVP over CMF was greater in postmenopausal (p = 0.02) than in premenopausal patients (p = 0.09). CMF-MER was similar to CMF alone. CMF related side effects were similar in each regimen (see text), except for a greater incidence of leukopenia during induction with CMF than with CMFVP (p less than 0.01).
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that affects much of the human population. As a secondary complication, diabetic neuropathy causes time-dependent damage to peripheral nerves. In this study, experimental diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ; 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) in rats. Diabetic animals were grouped into those with 2 or 4 weeks of diabetes, whereas a control group received only the STZ vehicle (0.1 M citrate). Sciatic nerves were dissected, and compound action potentials (CAPs) were recorded. Results deduced by conventional calculation carried less information when compared with conduction velocity distribution (CVD) obtained by a computer-based mathematical model. Using the conventional approach, statistically significant changes were first seen in the fourth week of diabetes, whereas results deduced by CVD measurement could be seen in the second week. Consequently, the CVD calculation provides more information for the early diagnosis of neuropathies compared with classical conduction velocity measurements.
In guinea-pigs and rats, ACTH-(1-24), i.m. injected in a dose-range of 10-150 micrograms/kg, dose-dependently antagonized the cholestatic effect of morphine (15 mg/kg i.m.). In guinea-pigs, however, the effect of morphine (66 +/- 7.7% bile flow) was only partially antagonized even by the highest dose of ACTH-(1-24) (89.21 +/- 3.4%), while in rats it was completely prevented by the dose of 75 micrograms/kg of ACTH. In morphine-dependent rats, ACTH-(1-24), injected i.p. at doses of 50, 100 and 150 micrograms/kg, dose-dependently increased the number of fecal pellets during the first 3 hr after treatment. These results show that ACTH antagonizes morphine in vivo at the biliary and intestinal level, and further support the idea that ACTH-MSH peptides are physiological antagonists of opioids.
It has been repeatedly shown that the heavy metal mercury can induce or exacerbate lupus like autoimmunity in susceptible strains of rats and mice. A hallmark of such autoimmune induction is the accompaniment of an immune shift, in which there is usually an initial skewing toward a Th2-like immune environment. Another heavy metal, lead (Pb), has also been found to induce a Th2 shift in mice. However, exposure of normal mouse strains to Pb does not appear to induce autoimmunity. In order to investigate whether mice genetically predisposed to murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are susceptible to a Pb-induced exacerbation of lupus, males and females of four New Zealand mixed (NZM) mouse strains, along with BALB/c and C57Bl/6 controls, were administered three 100-microliter intraperitoneal injections of either 1.31 mM lead or sodium acetate per week for 3 wk. The four NZM strains chosen, NZM391, NZM2328, NZM88, and NZM2758, have differential genetic penetrance for SLE with variances in certain manifestations of the disease, but all of these strains naturally develop glomerulonephritis and produce high titers of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. The mice were prebled for baseline values and were bled directly after the injection period (d 1) and monthly thereafter for 5 mo. Sera were assessed for anti-double-stranded DNA titers, urea nitrogen levels, and creatine kinase activity, as well as four total immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a and IgG1 levels. Mortality and morbidity of the mice were also recorded. All NZM strains showed an acute, non-gender-based, susceptibility to Pb at d 1, but the control strains were unaffected. Over time, it became apparent that the strains diverged: The NZM391 strain showed gender-independent susceptibility to Pb enhancement of lupus manifestations and mortality; the NZM2328 strain exhibited gender-independent Pb susceptibility to manifestations, although only females had increased mortality; the NZM2758 strain exhibited non-gender-based elevations in urea nitrogen and creatine kinase activity levels; and the NZM88 strain displayed male susceptibility to anti-DNA and life span. Surprisingly, Pb increased the longevity of NZM88 and NZM2758 females. These results indicate that Pb indeed can exacerbate SLE in lupus-prone mice; however, even among lupus-prone strains, genetic differences determine the degree of exacerbation. Using the known phenotype and genetic differences, one can identify and characterize possible traits and loci associated with Pb susceptibility.
Aquaporins (AQP) play important roles in water and glycerol transport. We examined whether AQP3 is expressed in primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) such as esophageal and oral cancer and lymph node metastasis, and whether AQP3 is a potential target for tumor therapy. A high level expression of AQP3 was observed in tumor areas of human primary SCC such as esophageal and lingual cancers, and lymph node metastasis, but was not observed in normal areas. Treatment with pan-AQP inhibitor caused apoptotic cell death on the SCC cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for AQP3 also inhibited cell adhesion and growth of SCC, but not those of adenocarcinoma cell lines and fibroblasts. Expression of integrin α5 and β1, counter adhesion molecules for fibronectin, was inhibited by treatment with AQP3-siRNA. The phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was decreased by treatment with AQP3-siRNA, which then caused decreases in phosphorylation of Erk and MAPK. These results indicate that the decreases in integrins and the inhibition of cell adhesion might cause inhibition of the FAK signaling pathways. Combination of AQP3-siRNA with cisplatin, a major anti-cancer drug, strongly inhibited the growth of SCC. Cell death caused by the inhibition of AQP3 was a result of direct interference with cell adhesion involving intracellular FAK-MAPK signaling pathways. These results imply a potentially important and novel role for the inhibition of AQP3 function via the use of specific siRNA in the treatment of SCC.
Chronic arsenic ingestion predisposes to vascular disease, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study we have analyzed the effects of short-term arsenite exposure on vascular function and endothelium-dependent relaxation. Endothelium-dependent relaxations, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-type, were studied in rabbit iliac artery and aortic rings using the G protein-coupled receptor agonist acetylcholine (ACh) and by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), which promotes store-operated Ca(2+) entry by inhibiting the endothelial SERCA pump. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the endothelium of rabbit aortic valve leaflets and endothelium-denuded RIA and aortic rings was assessed by imaging of dihydroethidium. In the iliac artery, exposure to 100 μM arsenite for 30 min potentiated EDHF-type relaxations evoked by both CPA and ACh. Potentiation was prevented by catalase, the catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic manganese porphyrin and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. By contrast in aortic rings, that exhibited negligible EDHF-type responses, endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxations evoked by CPA and ACh were unaffected by arsenite. Arsenite induced apocynin-sensitive increases in ROS production in the aortic valve endothelium, but not in the media and adventitia of the iliac artery and aorta. Our results suggest that arsenite can potentiate EDHF-type relaxations via a mechanism that is dependent on hydrogen peroxide, thus demonstrating that dismutation of the superoxide anion generated by NADPH oxidase can potentially offset loss of NO bioavailability under conditions of reduced eNOS activity. By contrast, selective increases in endothelial ROS production following exposure to arsenite failed to modify relaxations mediated by endogenous NO.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare complication of anticoagulative heparin therapy. The more severe HIT type II is defined by peripheral thrombocytopenia combined with thrombotic and thromboembolic events. We report the case of a 24 year old male patient who was admitted to our ICU with thromboembolic obstruction of the right central pulmonary artery, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the right superficial femoral vein. Systemic thrombolytic therapy with urokinase for seven days resulted in nearly complete resolution of the thromboembolic material in the pulmonary arteries. Antithrombotic therapy with intravenous heparin and overlapping oral phenoprocoumon was continued on the regular ward. Six days later, the patient had to be readmitted to the ICU with evidence of hemodynamic compromise due to massive bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism that could be confirmed by CT scan--DVT had extended to the right iliacal vein. Additionally, peripheral thrombocyte counts had markedly declined from 112.000 to 35.000/microliter within 3 days, indicating the presence of a Hit type II. This was verified by positive ELISA testing for antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin-complex. A filter device was temporarily implanted into the inferior vena cava. The patients condition stabilized upon reinitiated systemic thrombolysis and replacement of heparin therapy against recombinant hirudin. Pulmonary artery pressures normalized. Peripheral thrombocytopenia diminished within three days. HIT type II is a severe complication of anticoagulative therapy with heparin. Here we report a case, and discuss diagnostic procedures as well as differential diagnosis to HIT type I.
Acitretin is a synthetic retinoid used for severe extensive psoriasis and it has been shown to be an effective and a safe therapeutic drug for other diseases including cancer when used in combination with other agents. However, cases of acitretin-associated liver injury have been documented, but the possible mechanisms of acitretin-associated hepatotoxicity and apoptosis are not entirely clarified. This study reports that mitochondrial dysfunctions may play an important role in liver injury and apoptosis induced by this retinoid. Acitretin (5-20 μM) impaired mitochondrial phosphorylation efficiency as demonstrated by the decrease in the state 3 respiration and ATP levels, and by the increase in the lag phase of ADP phosphorylation cycle, without affecting the membrane potential. Acitretin induced Ca(2+)-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and decreased the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) content. Acitretin-induced MPT was not prevented by thiol group protecting and antioxidant agents, excluding the involvement of oxidative stress mechanisms. However, MPT was prevented by ANT ligands ATP, ADP, tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, implying that the MPT induction by acitretin is mediated by the ANT. ANT plays a major role in promoting apoptosis and ATP synthesis, and it is still considered as a structural component of the pore with a regulatory role in MPT formation. Therefore, our results, including the decrease in the state 3 respiration and the increase in the lag phase of phosphorylation cycle, the ATP depletion and the induction of Ca(2+)-mediated MPT, indicate that acitretin-associated liver toxicity and apoptosis is possibly related with mitochondrial dysfunctions due to interactions with the ANT. Additionally, the combination of acitretin with other drugs, such as antiestrogens, which are able to inhibit the MPT, may contribute to decrease the toxicity induced by acitretin.
The resistance of bladder carcinoma to anticancer chemotherapeutic agents remains a major problem. Hence, several immunotherapeutic approaches have been developed to treat the drug-resistant cancer cells. Fas antigen (Fas) and Fas ligand participate in cytotoxicity mediated by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Like Fas ligand, anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (MoAb) induces apoptosis of the cells expressing Fas. This study examined whether bladder carcinoma cells are sensitive to cytotoxicity mediated by anti-Fas MoAb and whether anticancer agents synergize with anti-Fas MoAb in cytotoxicity.
Cytotoxicity was determined by a 1-day microculture tetrazolium dye assay. Synergy was assessed by isobolographic analysis.
The T24 human bladder carcinoma cell line constitutively expressed the Fas on the cell surface; however, T24 line was resistant to anti-Fas MoAb. Treatment of T24 cells with anti-Fas MoAb in combination with mitomycin C, methotrexate, or 5-fluorouracil did not overcome their resistance to these agents. However, treatment of T24 cells with a combination of anti-Fas MoAb and doxorubicin resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect. In addition, the doxorubicin-resistant T24 cells were sensitive to treatment with a combination of anti-Fas MoAb and doxorubicin. Synergy was also achieved in three other bladder carcinoma cell lines and four freshly derived human bladder carcinoma cells. Treatment with anti-Fas MoAb in combination with epirubicin or pirarubicin also resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect on T24 cells. The mechanisms of synergy were examined. Anti-Fas MoAb did not affect the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin, the expression of P-glycoprotein, or the expression of the antioxidant glutathione S-transferase-pi mRNA. However, treatment with doxorubicin enhanced the expression of Fas on T24 cells.
This study demonstrated that treatment of bladder carcinoma cells with doxorubicin sensitized the cells to lysis by anti-Fas MoAb. The synergistic effect obtained with established doxorubicin-resistant bladder carcinoma cells and freshly isolated bladder carcinoma cells suggests that drug-resistant bladder carcinoma cells can be sensitized by doxorubicin to Fas- and Fas ligant-mediated cytotoxicity by lymphocytes. Furthermore, the sensitization required low concentrations of doxorubicin, thus supporting the in vivo application of a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of drug-resistant and/or immunotherapy-resistant bladder carcinoma.
Opioids given as adjuncts to balanced inhalational anaesthesia augment postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Tramadol, equipotent to pethidine, does not depress respiration, but can cause an increase in blood pressure and headache via its monoaminergic actions. Nalbuphine, ten times as potent as pethidine, has a ceiling respiratory depressant and ceiling analgesic effect at > 0.3 mg.kg-1. We compared the effects of equipotent doses of tramadol and nalbuphine (3.0 and 0.3 mg.kg-1, respectively) given as analgesic with induction of anaesthesia on emesis during recovery from anaesthesia and on PONV and headache until 24 h after ENT surgery, using saline (0.2 ml.kg-1) and an equipotent dose of pethidine (1.5 mg.kg-1) as controls.
The study population (N = 281) comprised 4 comparable subgroups (N = 69 to 71 each). Anaesthetic medications were standardised. Emesis during recovery from anaesthesia and nausea, vomiting, retching, headache and administrations of antiemetic and analgesics until 24 h after surgery were recorded.
Emesis and antiemetic requirements during recovery from anaesthesia were similar and infrequent in each group, as were the incidences of nausea alone (3 to 5%), vomiting alone (17 to 31%), and nausea with vomiting (10 to 22%) during the first 24 h after surgery. However, any complaint of PONV was least frequent in the saline and pethidine groups (32% and 37%, respectively) and most frequent in the tramadol and nalbuphine groups (49% and 52%, respectively; P < 0.05 versus saline, both comparisons; P = NS versus pethidine, both comparisons). The times to onset and severity of PONV were similar in each group, but patients given nalbuphine most frequently (P < 0.025) needed rescue antiemetic to treat PONV. Headache occurred with similar frequency in each group.
It is concluded that tramadol, nalbuphine and pethidine have similar emetic effect in the doses and manner used, and that tramadol does not increase the incidence of post-operative headache when used as peroperative analgesic.
Metoclopramide administered intravenously (i.v.) immediately before injection of propofol, after mixing with propofol, or after a rubber tourniquet for 1 min before propofol injection will reduce pain induced by propofol injection. In this study, these three different techniques in reducing propofol injection pain with metoclopramide were compared with lidocaine or saline to evaluate the most effective method in reducing propofol injection pain.
In a randomized, semi-double-blind treatment, 175 patients were included into this study. Patients in group A were pretreated with metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. before propofol (2 mg/kg) induction. Patients in group B were induced with a mixture of propofol and metoclopramide. Patients in group C were pretreated with metoclopramide i.v. with a rubber tourniquet on the arm for 1 min followed by propofol administration. Groups D and E were identical to group C except for the replacement of pretreatment with either lidocaine (40 mg) or saline, respectively.
Groups A, C and D (with active pain prophylaxis) showed a significantly less incidence of pain than the saline control group (E) as propofol was injected. There was no significance difference between metoclopramide and lidocaine in reducing propofol injection pain using a tourniquet technique. The intensity of the propofol injection pain (verbal pain score) was stronger with saline as compared with the other groups.
We conclude that i.v. retention of metoclopramide with tourniquet is as good as lidocaine and may be a useful alternative for reducing pain on propofol injection.
The reduced antioxidant defense in apolipoprotein E epsilon4/epsilon4 carriers may contribute to beta-amyloidosis. Previously we found that Fe(2+)-induced oxidative stress caused greater protein oxidation in epsilon4/epsilon4 than in epsilon3/epsilon3 human brain vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, Fe(2+) induced lysosomal accumulation of endogenous Abeta and APOE in cultured cells, and Abeta deposition in vascular tunica media in organotypic cultures of brain vessels. Here we demonstrated that Fe(2+) enhanced an uptake of exogenous Abeta 1-40 and its deposition together with APOE in lysosomes in myocytes. Abeta deposits were associated with lipid-peroxidation and protein ubiquitination, and were more abundant and stable in epsilon4/epsilon4 than in epsilon3/epsilon3 cells. In organotypic cultures of brain vessels Fe(2+) induced deposition of non-fibrillar and fibrillar Abeta 1-40 in vascular tunica media. We hypothesize that locally increased concentrations of iron induce accumulation of exogenous and endogenous Abeta in SMCs, triggering beta-amyloid angiopathy. The greater susceptibility of epsilon4 carriers to Fe(2+) ions may result in an increased risk of beta-amyloidosis.
