This two-phase, multicenter study was undertaken to examine the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with oral doxycycline and topical azelaic acid (AzA) 15% gel in moderate-to-severe papulopustular rosacea and to determine the effect of subsequent maintenance monotherapy with AzA 15% gel alone. In the initial open-label, non-randomized phase of the study, subjects (n=172) received topical AzA 15% gel and oral doxycycline (100 mg), both twice daily, for < or = 12 weeks. In the second, double-blind study phase, subjects who had initially undergone at least four weeks of combination treatment in phase 1 and who achieved > or = 75% inflammatory lesion count reduction (n=136) were randomized to receive either AzA 15% gel or its vehicle twice daily for an additional 24 weeks. Assessments of efficacy were obtained at four-week intervals throughout both phases of the study and included change in inflammatory lesion count, investigator global assessment (IGA) of rosacea severity, and separate assessments of erythema and telangiectasia severity. At the last visit for each phase of the study, the investigator and participant each rated overall improvement, with the participant rating cosmetic acceptability and the investigator rating treatment as "success" or "failure" based on IGA score. During the second phase of the trial, the rate of relapse -- defined as either a 50% deterioration in the lesion count improvement from phase 1, an increase in erythema intolerable to the subject or maintenance therapy failure as judged by the investigator and/or the subject -- was obtained. Safety assessments were conducted for both phases of the study and included analysis of adverse events (AEs) and a rating of cutaneous tolerability by the subject. By week 12 of the open-label phase of the study, 81.4% of subjects had reached a 75% or greater reduction in inflammatory lesion count, and 64% of patients achieved treatment success. During the second study phase (maintenance phase), AzA 15% gel consistently provided a better maintenance response than vehicle, with maintenance of remission in 75% of patients over the six-month duration of the maintenance phase. Additionally AzA 15% gel showed a statistically significantly lower deterioration in absolute inflammatory lesion counts than did vehicle after 8, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of maintenance therapy. No serious treatment-related AEs were encountered in the study, and 98.5% of subjects were satisfied with the local tolerability of both AzA gel and vehicle.
Previous trials demonstrated the effectiveness of the leukotriene receptor antagonist zafirlukast in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma.
We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of zafirlukast and its effect on patients' quality of life (QOL) during a 13-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in adults and adolescents with moderate reversible airflow obstruction.
Patients (age range, 12 to 68 years) with total daytime asthma symptoms scores of 10 or greater over 7 consecutive days (maximum, 21/wk), FEV1 45% or greater but less than or equal to 80% of predicted value (>/=6 hours after beta2 -agonist), and reversible airway disease were randomized to 20 mg zafirlukast twice daily (nZ = 231) or placebo twice daily (nP = 223). Efficacy was assessed from changes in daytime and nocturnal symptoms, beta2 -agonist use, nasal congestion score, and pulmonary function. QOL was evaluated with a disease-specific Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. Safety was determined from adverse event information and clinical laboratory test results.
Zafirlukast was significantly (P <.001) more effective than placebo, with reductions from baseline in the daytime asthma symptoms score (-23%), nighttime awakenings with asthma (-19%), and beta2 -agonist use (-24%) and improvements from baseline in morning (+25 L/min) and evening (+18 L/min) peak expiratory flow rates. Compared with placebo, zafirlukast significantly (P </=.018) improved scores for QOL domains (activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function, and exposure to environmental stimuli) and overall QOL, with a significantly greater proportion of zafirlukast-treated patients demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements (>/=0.5-unit change from baseline; P </=.037). The safety profile of zafirlukast was clinically indistinguishable from that of placebo.
Zafirlukast is effective and well tolerated and improves QOL in the long-term treatment of patients with moderate reversible airflow obstruction.
We examined the relation between overall 1-year exposure to diet and drugs prescribed for hyperlipidemia and the occurrence of medically certified absence from work with depression during the year of exposure (N = 289). The 17,244 persons studied are middle-aged employees of a national company who volunteered as cohort participants. Depression was more prevalent among those exposed to an antihyperlipidemic diet (N = 1,614) than among those unexposed. After stratification by sex and professional status, we found a prevalence ratio (PR) of 1.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-2.58]. Exposure to simvastatin (N = 376) produced comparable results, with a prevalence ratio of 2.18 (95% CI = 1.18-4.03). For subjects who were not cases in the year of exposure assessment, the hypolipidemic treatments are not associated with depression-induced absenteeism the following year. Our results point to a possible role of prescribed diet and simvastatin in depression-related absenteeism.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate pulmonary function tests and arterial oxygen transport in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to congestive heart failure before and after cilazapril treatment. Thirty patients (16 men and 14 women, mean age, 65 +/- 18 years) with congestive heart failure and 30 healthy volunteers (20 men and 10 women, mean age 59 +/- 12 years, p > 0.05) were included in the study. All patients underwent evaluation of pulmonary function by spirometry and arterial blood gas analysis. Arterial oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen transport changed significantly after treatment (81 +/- 7 to 87 +/- 8 and 317 +/- 74 to 392 +/- 8, respectively). Forced expiration volume in 1 second, vital capacity and total lung capacity were increased after cilazapril treatment (2.55 +/- 0.7 to 2.61 +/- 0.8, 3.2 +/- 0.9 to 3.3 +/- 1.0 and 3.6 +/- 0.9 to 4.1 +/- 1.1, respectively, p < 0.05). In conclusion, short-term cilazapril administration improved pulmonary function and arterial oxygen transport because it increased cardiac output, produced pulmonary vasodilatation, improved the pulmonary hemodynamics and removed interstitial fluid.
The authors made a randomized prospective study of estrogen therapy versus orchidectomy in patients with prostatic cancer (n = 100, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden) to investigate the possibility of predicting cardiovascular events during hormonal treatment. Patients with preexisting cardiovascular morbidity were excluded (16%). Prior to the allocation of therapy, the following were performed: exercise stress test; physiologic evaluation of the peripheral circulation; blood volume estimation; chest x-ray; blood tests, including hormones, lipoproteins, and antithrombin III; and a physical examination and history by a cardiologist. Thirteen (25%) of the patients given estrogen therapy (n = 53) had cardiovascular complications during the first year of treatment compared with none in the orchidectomy group. The authors made a multivariate discriminant analysis of the pretreatment examinations of the estrogen-treated patients; this resulted in a discriminant function including S-T segment depression in lead CH2 during the exercise stress test and blood tests for cholesterol, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. This function correctly classified 84% of the estrogen-treated patients as patients with or without risk of a cardiovascular complication. Briefly stated, if patients with prostatic cancer are examined by means of exercise stress tests and blood tests for luteinizing hormone, cholesterol, and follicle-stimulating hormone prior to treatment, the discriminant function enables the authors to identify an extremely high-risk group for cardiovascular complications if estrogen therapy is commenced. The strong association of an increased luteinizing hormone with cardiovascular complications during estrogen treatment makes it mandatory to investigate its role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.
Twenty patients aged 33 to 69 years with uncomplicated hypertension, no heart disease, and normal stress test results underwent ambulatory ECG monitoring a month after receiving placebo and two and four weeks after hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Serum potassium level (+/- SEM) averaged 4.4 +/- 0.09 mEq/L after the placebo trial and 3.4 +/- 0.07 and 3.0 +/- 0.06 mEq/L after two and four weeks of therapy, respectively. Sixteen patients had no arrhythmias. Four patients had 329 +/- 140 premature ventricular beats (PVBs) while receiving placebo and 341 +/- 203 and 315 +/- 158 PVBs per 24 hours after two and four weeks of therapy, respectively. Thus, patients with uncomplicated hypertension and no arrhythmias before diuretic therapy did not experience arrhythmias as a result of diuretic-induced hypokalemia of one month's duration. Patients with low-grade ventricular ectopy (VE) before therapy did not progress to higher grades of VE after diuretic treatment for four weeks.
Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) is an essential cofactor of various metabolic pathways. Lack of it leads to symptoms which may be constitutional, of skin or mucous membranes, hematological or neuropsychiatric disorders. Neurological involvement in adults has been well described and analyzed in the literature, however there are fewer cases of children. In the cases described in children the deficiency was related to maternal malnutrition, and socioeconomic and cultural problems. Since vegetarianism is a custom followed by different social groups we wish to draw attention to this as a cause of vitamin B12 deficiency and the neurological disorder this may cause.
We describe the case of a 10 year old boy, a member of a religious community who were strict vegetarians. Over three months he developed: a cognitive disorder, pyramidal syndrome of his legs, involvement of the posterior spinal cord, peripheral motor and sensory alterations which, together with the complementary investigations, was found to be compatible with subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency.
We draw attention to the clinical and laboratory aspects of this disorder and the importance of taking the possibility of this diagnosis into account in children with nutritional risk factors.
The authors analyze the incidence of sexual dysfunction (SD) with different SSRIs (Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Paroxetine and Sertraline) and hence the qualitative and quantitative changes in SD throughout time 308 outpatients (169 women, 139 men; mean +/- SD age = 41 +/- 7) under treatment with SSRIs were interviewed with an SD questionnaire designed for this purpose by the authors including questions about the following items decreased libido, delayed orgasm or anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation inability to ejaculation, impotence and general sexual satisfaction. Patients with the following criteria were included: normal sexual function before SSRIs intake, exclusive treatment with SSRIs or associated with benzodiazepines, previous heterosexual or self-orone current sexual practices. We excluded patients with previous sexual dysfunction, association of SSRIs with neuroleptics, recently hormone intake and significant medical illnesses.
There is a significant increase in the incidence of SD when the physicians ask the patients direct questions (55.29%) versus spontaneous SD reported (14.2%). There are some significant differences among different SSRIs paroxetine provoked more delay of orgasm/ejaculation and more impotence than fluvoxamine, fluoxetine and sertraline (Chi square p < 0.05). Only 22.6% of the patients had a good tolerance about their sexual dysfunction. SD has positive correlation with the dose. The patients experienced substantial improvement in sexual function when the dose was diminished or the drug was withdrawn. Men showed more incidence of sexual dysfunction than women but women's sexual dysfunction was more intense than men. Seven of nine patients (77.7%) experienced total improvement when the treatment was changed to Moclobemide (450 mg/day) and two of four patients (50%) improved when treatment was changed to Amineptine.
The most substantial factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers of the gastroduodenum is a preserved HCl secretion (frequently hypersecretion) and the presence of Helicobacter pylori. In some of the ulcers a part is played by non-steroid antirheumatic drugs. In the treatment inhibition of acid secretion by antagonists of H2 receptors proved useful as they heal approximately 80% ulcers in the course of four weeks. Drugs of this group however, do not resolve the main problem of anti-ulcerous treatment, i.e. the liability of ulcers to relapse. 70-80% of the patients develop a relapse within one to two years. Moreover, in 5-10% of the patients the ulcers are resistant to treatment with H2 receptor antagonists. An obvious advance in treatment are inhibitors of the proton pump which intensely inhibit HCl secretion independently on the type of stimulation. At present in clinical practice omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole are used, all being derivates of benzimidazole. They are the drugs of choice in ulcers resistant to H2 receptor antagonists, in severe forms of reflux oesophagitis in Zollinger-Ellison's syndrome, in ulcers induced by non-steroid antirheumatics. The most substantial fact is that in combination with amoxacillin (or another suitable antibiotic) in 70-80% of cases they eradicate also Helicobacter pylori and heal in a large percentage (70-80%) the ulcerous defect within two weeks.
Tetras (tetra-arsenic oxide, As(4)O(6)) is a derivative of arsenic used in Korean traditional medicine for the treatment of cancer, but its mechanism remains largely undefined. Recently, a similar arsenic derivative, diarsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3), ATO), has been shown to mediate anti-tumor activity, therefore reigniting interest in the therapeutic effect of arsenic compounds. Here we report that Tetras can effectively mediate an anti-vascular effect on tumors, leading to delay in tumor growth and increased survival. Our study demonstrates for the first time the potential use of Tetras as a radiation therapy enhancement agent for solid tumors. These findings reveal an unappreciated role of Tetras in cancer therapy and its potential application to radiotherapy in achieving local tumor control.
A myopathy caused by the activity of polymyxin E on the cell membrane was accompained by immunological manifestations. There were also disturbances of the central nervous system, contrasting with the absence of serious renal lesion.
Telavancin (TD-6424) is a novel lipoglycopeptide that produces rapid and concentration-dependent killing of clinically relevant gram-positive organisms in vitro. The present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacodynamics of telavancin in the mouse neutropenic thigh (MNT) and mouse subcutaneous infection (MSI) animal models. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in the MNT model demonstrated that the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC ratio was the best predictor of efficacy. Telavancin produced dose-dependent reduction of thigh titers of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The 50% effective dose (ED50) estimates for telavancin ranged from 0.5 to 6.6 mg/kg of body weight (administered intravenously), and titers were reduced by up to 3 log10 CFU/g from pretreatment values. Against MRSA ATCC 33591, telavancin was 4- and 30-fold more potent (on an ED50 basis) than vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. Against MSSA ATCC 13709, telavancin was 16- and 40-fold more potent than vancomycin and nafcillin, respectively. Telavancin, vancomycin, and linezolid were all efficacious and more potent against MRSA ATCC 33591 in the MSI model compared to the MNT model. This deviation in potency was, however, disproportionately greater for vancomycin and linezolid than for telavancin, suggesting that activity of telavancin is less affected by the immune status. The findings of these studies collectively suggest that once-daily dosing of telavancin may provide an effective approach for the treatment of clinically relevant infections with gram-positive organisms.
Crocetin, a carotenoid compound, has been shown to reduce expression of inflammation and inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species. In the present study, the effect of crocetin on acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated in vivo. In the mouse model, pretreatment with crocetin at dosages of 50 and 100 mg/kg reduced the LPS-induced lung oedema and histological changes, increased LPS-impaired superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and decreased lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Furthermore, treatment with crocetin significantly attenuated LPS-induced mRNA and the protein expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in lung tissue. In addition, crocetin at different dosages reduced phospho-IκB expression and NF-κB activity in LPS-induced lung tissue alteration. These results indicate that crocetin can provide protection against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.
Basal cell carcinoma, the most frequent skin cancer in humans, is often linked to chronic sun exposure. In psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients, basal cell carcinomas may occur even more frequently; however, the exact etiology and mechanisms of tumorigenesis in psoriatic patients are unclear because psoralen and ultraviolet A is not only a carcinogen but also an immunosuppressor and because psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients often have other (co)carcinogenic risk factors (e.g, therapeutic exposure to ultraviolet B, X-ray radiation, arsenic, tar, and/or chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate). In this study, we analyzed the DNA of 13 basal cell carcinomas from five psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients for mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. DNA sequencing revealed a total of 11 mis-sense, two non-sense, and four silent mutations in seven of the 13 basal cell carcinomas (54%). Of the 13 total mis-sense or non-sense mutations, 12 (92%) occurred at dipyrimidine sites and nine (69%) were of the ultraviolet fingerprint type (eight C-->T transitions and one CC-->TT transition). Three of the C-->T transitions occurred at dipyrimidine sites opposite a 5'-TpG sequence (a potential psoralen-binding site and target for psoralen and ultraviolet A mutagenesis). Thus, whether these mutations were induced by ultraviolet or psoralen and ultraviolet A was not clear. In addition, two other mutations (15%) occurred at 5'-TpG sites, one (8%) occurred at a 5'-TpA site (the most frequent site of psoralen binding and mutagenesis in cell and murine studies), and one (8%) involved a G-->T transversion. These results suggest that (i) the major initiator of p53 mutations in basal cell carcinoma in psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriasis patients is environmental and/or therapeutic ultraviolet(B) exposure, and that (ii) psoralen and ultraviolet A itself causes only a smaller portion of p53 mutations in psoralen and ultraviolet A-associated basal cell carcinomas.
Severe transplacental lithium toxicity in a neonate is described. There were gross functional lesions of the cardiovascular, renal, and neuromuscular systems with no structural abnormalities. At 1 year of age cardiovascular and renal function is normal, but there is developmental delay.
Contingency management (CM) for drug abstinence has been applied to individuals independently even when delivered in groups. We developed a group CM intervention in which the behavior of a single, randomly selected, anonymous individual determined reinforcement delivery for the entire group. We also compared contingencies placed only on cocaine abstinence (CA) versus one of four behaviors (CA, treatment attendance, group CM attendance, and methadone compliance) selected randomly at each drawing. Two groups were formed with 22 cocaine-dependent community-based methadone patients and exposed to both CA and multiple behavior (MB) conditions in a reversal design counterbalanced across groups for exposure order. The group CM intervention proved feasible and safe. The MB condition improved group CM meeting attendance relative to the CA condition.
We report a case of isolated atrial flutter in a neonate, attributable to maternal lithium treatment, and suggest that the assessment of all infants born to mothers on lithium treatment during pregnancy should include an electrocardiogram.
Childhood intrinsic brain-stem gliomas have a dismal prognosis. Different treatment strategies have been adopted over the years without changing the final outcome of this ominous disease. Due to this grim prognosis, experimental therapeutic designs are worthwhile. Vinorelbine is a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid that has demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity both in in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. By adopting vinorelbine during and after focal radiotherapy in the last two years, we have tried to evocate its known synergistic effect in brain-stem tumour control. Vinorelbine was administered intravenously before, during and after radiotherapy on tumour bed for a total duration of 10 months. All the consecutive patients whose clinical and radiological features corresponded to the diagnosis of an intrinsic brain-stem tumour, i.e., diffuse pontine glioma, have been accrued to this treatment protocol since July 2002. A histological assessment was not required. All patients were treated during hospital stay or in the outpatient clinic at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan (n=12) and at the Pediatric Clinic of Policlinico in Catania (n=1). Two of the thirteen patients so far treated have developed multiple subsequent, and transitory, episodes of monolateral peripheral facial nerve palsy during vinorelbine administration. The palsy always completely and spontaneously resolved at a short interval-around 30 min-after the end of the drug infusion. Obvious tumour progression was excluded by means of MRI; therefore the drug was administered as scheduled until the end of the treatment. We describe possible neurological and oncological implications of this unusual side effect, until now not reported in any other series dealing with vinorelbine as adjuvant treatment.
The sulfidopeptide leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 are released from mast cells in response to allergen challenge and may be involved in the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled allergen in asthma. Since mast cell activation may also be implicated in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, we assessed the inhibitory effects of a potent orally active leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist, ICI 204219 (20 mg), on the bronchoconstrictor response to exercise in eight male asthmatic patients in a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. Exercise challenge respiring dry air was performed on a treadmill at constant speed and gradient 2 h after drug administration, and bronchoconstriction was assessed as change in FEV1 over 30 min postexercise. No significant effect on airway caliber, measured as FEV1, was noted 2 h after ICI 204219. The mean maximum percentage fall in FEV1 following exercise was 36.0% following placebo, and reduced to 21.6% after ICI 204219 (p less than 0.01). Analysis of the time course of bronchoconstriction showed that inhibition was most marked over the latter part of the period assessed. These data indicate that the release of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes makes a major contribution to exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
The use of pesticides has enhanced the health and economies of nations around the world by improving crop production. However, pesticides may pose health risks, particularly to the fetus and young children. In a secondary analysis of the Ontario Farm Family Health Study, we explored the relationship between birth defects and parental pesticide exposure during the 3 months prior to conception and the first trimester of pregnancy. A total of 3412 pregnancies were included in the study. Logistic regression fit by maximum likelihood was used in the analysis. The results showed that pre-conception exposure to both cyanazine (odds ratio=4.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.63-15.27) and dicamba (OR=2.42, 95% CI: 1.06-5.53) were associated with increased risk of birth defects in male offspring. Nevertheless, given the self-reported nature of the exposure and outcomes in this study, the present findings should be considered primarily as hypothesis generating, requiring verification in subsequent investigations.
Building on the prior work of use of pentostatin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we initiated a trial of combined pentostatin (2 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), and rituximab (375 mg/m2) for 65 symptomatic, previously untreated patients. Of 64 evaluable patients, 34 (53%) were high Rai risk, 71% were nonmutated for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene, 34% were CD38+, and 34% were ZAP-70+. Thirty patients (52%) had one anomaly detected by fluorescence in situ (FISH) hybridization, and 21 (36%) had complex FISH defects. Thirty-eight patients (58%) had grade 3+ hematologic toxicity but minimal transfusion needs and no major infections. Responses occurred in 58 patients (91%), with 26 (41%) complete responses (CRs), 14 (22%) nodular partial responses (nodular PRs), and 18 (28%) partial responses (PRs). Many patients with a CR also lacked evidence of minimal residual disease by 2-color flow cytometry. Examination of prognostic factors demonstrated poor response in the 3 patients with del(17p). In contrast, we found this regimen was equally effective in young versus older (>70 years) patients and in del(11q22.3) versus other favorable prognostic factors. Thus, this novel regimen of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab for previously untreated patients with CLL demonstrated significant clinical activity despite poor risk-based prognoses, achievement of minimal residual disease in some, and modest toxicity.
Infusion phlebitis is a common clinical problem associated with some antimicrobial agents. The pathomechanism of infusion phlebitis has not yet been elucidated, however, it has been proposed that chemical irritation of the endothelium leads to subsequent sterile inflammation with recruitment and migration of leukocytes. In the present study, cultured endothelial cells were exposed to antibiotics at clinically relevant concentrations to detect changes in various cell surface markers.
Cells from the endothelial hybrid cell line Eahy926 were exposed to quinupristin/dalfopristin, erythromycin and levofloxacin at increasing concentrations (3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/l) for 24 h. After washing, the cells were marked with monoclonal antibodies against different cell surface antigens (intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 [PECAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1], E-selectin, L-selectin, CD34, alpha(2), alpha(5), beta(1) and beta(4) integrin chains and analysed by flow cytometry. For comparison, cells were either untreated or incubated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) at a concentration of 10 ng/ml and analysed for ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression.
There was an increase in ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells with increasing concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin. VCAM-1, E-selectin, L-selectin and CD34 showed an excursive upregulation at the concentration of 100 mg/l only, while no consistent changes were observed for PECAM-1 and the integrins. Markedly less prominent changes in the expression of these adhesion molecules were seen with erythromycin while no relevant changes at all occurred with levofloxacin. The absolute change in ICAM-1 activation with quinupristin/dalfopristin at 100 mg/l (34.4%) was less pronounced than that observed after stimulation with TNF-alpha (>80%).
The results of this study indicate that antibiotics with a high potential for local cytotoxicity may cause an inflammatory response by endothelial cells even at rather low concentrations. The increase in expression of cell surface markers involved in cell-cell interaction could be an important mechanism in the development of infusion phlebitis.
This study has compared the relative nephrotoxicity of chronic treatment with aspirin or paracetamol in an animal model. Changes in renal structure and urinary concentrating ability were examined in female Fischer 344 rats after continuous treatment with either aspirin (120-230 mg/kg body wt/day), or paracetamol (140-210 mg/kg body wt/day), and were compared with age-matched untreated control rats. Renal morphological changes were examined after 40-83 weeks of analgesic treatment, using light and electron microscopy. Aspirin caused renal papillary necrosis and a decrease in urinary concentrating ability, whereas paracetamol alone did not cause significant renal damage. Aspirin produced damage to the interstitial cells and matrix, particularly in the mid-papillary region, followed by changes to the thin limbs of the loop of Henle and medullary capillary endothelium. These structural changes were similar to those described previously, when continuous treatment with combined aspirin and paracetamol was studied in the same animal model.
Organophosphorus anticholinesterases (OPs) elicit acute toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), leading to acetylcholine accumulation and overstimulation of cholinergic receptors. Endocannabinoids (eCBs, e.g., arachidonoyl ethanolamide [AEA] and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol [2-AG]) are neuromodulators that regulate neurotransmission by reducing neurotransmitter release. The eCBs are degraded by the enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH, primarily involved in hydrolysis of AEA) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL, primarily responsible for metabolism of 2-AG). We previously reported that the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 reduced cholinergic toxicity after paraoxon exposure. This study compared the effects of the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251 on acute toxicity following either paraoxon (PO) or chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO). CPO was more potent in vitro than PO at inhibiting AChE (≈ 2 fold), FAAH (≈ 8 fold), and MAGL (≈ 19 fold). Rats were treated with vehicle, PO (0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg, sc) or CPO (6 and 12 mg/kg, sc) and subsets treated with AM251 (3mg/kg, ip; 30 min after OP). Signs of toxicity were recorded for 4h and rats were then sacrificed. OP-treated rats showed dose-related involuntary movements, with AM251 increasing signs of toxicity with the lower dosages. PO and CPO elicited excessive secretions, but AM251 had no apparent effect with either OP. Lethality was increased by AM251 with the higher dosage of PO, but no lethality was noted with either dosage of CPO, with or without AM251. Both OPs caused extensive inhibition of hippocampal AChE and FAAH (>80-90%), but only CPO inhibited MAGL (37-50%). These results provide further evidence that eCB signaling can influence acute OP toxicity. The selective in vivo inhibition of MAGL by CPO may be important in the differential lethality noted between PO and CPO with AM251 co-administration.
We report 6 cases of bile duct strictures in patients receiving intraarterial floxuridine chemotherapy for metastatic colon carcinoma. The computed tomographic and cholangiographic features of these cases mimic those seen with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The postulated mechanism for development of biliary strictures is direct toxicity and/or occlusion of the peribiliary vascular plexus with resultant biliary fibrosis.
