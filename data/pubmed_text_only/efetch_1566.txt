Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that is more effective than the standard neuroleptics currently used for treating refractory schizophrenia. In addition, clozapine is a drug with few extrapyramidal side effects. However, clozapine is also associated with potentially serious adverse effects, such as cardiac complications as well as agranulocytosis. Clozapine-related cardiomyopathy has not been previously reported in East Asia. This report describes a 31-year-old Korean male patient with schizophrenia who developed dilated cardiomyopathy on treatment with clozapine. The removal of clozapine caused subsequent physical improvement. However, the readministration of clozapine for managing relapse of psychosis caused a recurrence of dilated cardiomyopathy in this patient. Therefore, this is the 1st report showing that the 2nd trial of clozapine caused recurrence of cardiomyopathy associated with clozapine. Thus, this report adds important support for a causal relation between clozapine and cardiac complications. In conclusion, this report attempts to raise awareness of clozapine-related cardiomyopathy.
To determine the safety and efficacy of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
Forty patients experiencing first (n = 21) or > or = second (n = 19) relapse were treated with daily infusions of ATO to a maximum of 60 doses or until all leukemic cells in bone marrow were eliminated. Patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) were offered one consolidation course of ATO that began 3 to 4 weeks later. Patients who remained in CR were eligible to receive further cycles of ATO therapy on a maintenance study.
Thirty-four patients (85%) achieved a CR. Thirty-one patients (91%) with CRs had posttreatment cytogenetic tests negative for t(15;17). Eighty-six percent of the patients who were assessable by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction converted from positive to negative for the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha transcript by the completion of their consolidation therapy. Thirty-two patients received consolidation therapy, and 18 received additional ATO as maintenance. Eleven patients underwent allogeneic (n = 8) or autologous (n = 3) transplant after ATO treatment. The 18-month overall and relapse-free survival (RFS) estimates were 66% and 56%, respectively. Twenty patients (50%) had leukocytosis (> 10,000 WBC/microL) during induction therapy. Ten patients developed signs or symptoms suggestive of the APL syndrome and were effectively treated with dexamethasone. Electrocardiographic QT prolongation was common (63%). One patient had an absolute QT interval of > 500 msec and had an asymptomatic 7-beat run of torsades de pointe. Two patients died during induction, neither from drug-related causes.
This study establishes ATO as a highly effective therapy for patients with relapsed APL.
Levosimendan is a new cardiac enhancer that exerts positive inotropic effects on the failing heart mediated by calcium sensitization of contractile proteins as well as peripheral vasodilatory effects mediated by opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth-muscle cells. Levosimendan is the most well-studied calcium sensitizer in the real clinical practice, producing greater hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in patients with acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) than those with traditional inotropes. Immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic properties of levosimendan may be an additional biologic mechanism that prevents further cytotoxic and hemodynamic consequences of abnormal immune and neurohormonal responses in AHFS. Recent mortality trials showed that levosimendan does not improve short- and long-term prognosis in AHFS in comparison to dobutamine or placebo. However, in patients with a previous history of CHF and on beta-blocker on admission, levosimendan seems to have a beneficial effect on short-term mortality. According to the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology, levosimendan is indicated in patients with symptomatic low cardiac output HF secondary to cardiac systolic dysfunction without severe hypotension (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).
Wilson disease (WD) is caused by accumulation of excess copper (Cu) due to a mutation in the gene encoding the liver Cu transporter ATP7B, and is characterized by acute liver failure or cirrhosis and neuronal cell death. We investigated the effect of OSIP108, a plant derived decapeptide that prevents Cu-induced apoptosis in yeast and human cells, on Cu-induced toxicity in various mammalian in vitro models relevant for WD and in a Cu-toxicity zebrafish larvae model applicable to WD.
The effect of OSIP108 was evaluated on viability of various cell lines in the presence of excess Cu, on liver morphology of a Cu-treated zebrafish larvae strain that expresses a fluorescent reporter in hepatocytes, and on oxidative stress levels in wild type AB zebrafish larvae.
OSIP108 increased not only viability of Cu-treated CHO cells transgenically expressing ATP7B and the common WD-causing mutant ATP7B(H1069Q), but also viability of Cu-treated human glioblastoma U87 cells. Aberrancies in liver morphology of Cu-treated zebrafish larvae were observed, which were further confirmed as Cu-induced hepatotoxicity by liver histology. Injections of OSIP108 into Cu-treated zebrafish larvae significantly increased the amount of larvae with normal liver morphology and decreased Cu-induced production of reactive oxygen species.
OSIP108 prevents Cu-induced toxicity in in vitro models and in a Cu-toxicity zebrafish larvae model applicable to WD.
All the above data indicate the potential of OSIP108 as a drug lead for further development as a novel WD treatment.
Choreatiform hyperkinesias are known to be occasional movement abnormalities during intoxications with cocaine but not opiates. This is a case report of euphoria and choreoathetoid movements both transiently induced by rapid adjustment to the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist methadone in an inpatient previously abusing heroine and cocaine. In addition, minor EEG abnormalities occurred. Possible underlying neurobiological phenomena are discussed.
Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) has important regulatory functions in vascular tone, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is a key event in diabetes and atherosclerosis. Vitis amurensis grapes containing resveratrol oligomers are consumed as wine and fruit and have antioxidative and neuroprotective effects. In this study, our goal was identify the most potent eNOS-activating compound among six stilbenes and oligostilbenes found in V. amurensis and to clarify its molecular mechanism. Among the six tested compounds, amurensin G most potently relaxed endothelium-intact aortic rings and increased eNOS phosphorylation and nitric oxide (NO) production. Amurensin G increased both estrogen receptor (ER) phosphorylation and ER-dependent gene transcription, and ERα or ERβ inhibition suppressed amurensin G-mediated eNOS phosphorylation. Amurensin G enhanced the activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Src and their chemical inhibitors suppressed amurensin G-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation. Moreover, amurensin G activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and amurensin G-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation and PI3K activation were reversed by AMPK inhibition. ER inhibition reversed AMPK-dependent PI3K activation in response to amurensin G. Amurensin G-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation was blocked by inhibition of AMPK, ER, Src, or PI3K. These results suggest that amurensin G enhances NO production via eNOS phosphorylation in endothelial cells, and ER-dependent AMPK/PI3K pathways are required. Amurensin G would be applicable to prevent atherosclerosis.
Current evidence suggests suceptibility of both the substantia nigra and striatum to exposure to components of air pollution. Further, air pollution has been associated with increased risk of PD diagnsosis in humans or PD-like pathology in animals. This study examined whether exposure of mice to concentrated ambient ultrafine particles (CAPS; <100nm diameter) during the first two weeks of life would alter susceptibility to induction of the Parkinson's disease phenyotype (PDP) in a pesticide-based paraquat and maneb (PQ+MB) model during adulthood utilizing i.p. injections of 10mg/kg PQ and 30mg/kg MB 2× per week for 6 weeks. Evidence of CAPS-induced enhancement of the PQ+MB PDP was limited primarily to delayed recovery of locomotor activity 24 post-injection of PQ+MB that could be related to alterations in striatal GABA inhibitory function. Absence of more extensive interactions might also reflect the finding that CAPS and PQ+MB appeared to differentially target the nigrostriatal dopamine and amino acid systems, with CAPS impacting striatum and PQ+MB impacting dopamine-glutamate function in midbrain; both CAPS and PQ+MB elevated glutamate levels in these specific regions, consistent with potential excitotoxicity. These findings demonstrate the ability of postnatal CAPS to produce locomotor dysfunction and dopaminergic and glutamateric changes, independent of PQ+MB, in brain regions involved in the PDP.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor that is characterized by high proliferative rate and invasiveness. Since dysregulation of Notch signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, here we investigated the role of Notch signaling in GBM. We found that there is aberrant activation of Notch signaling in GBM cell lines and human GBM-derived neurospheres. Inhibition of Notch signaling via the expression of a dominant negative form of the Notch coactivator, mastermind-like 1 (DN-MAML1), or the treatment of a γ-secretase inhibitor, (GSI) MRK-003, resulted in a significant reduction in GBM cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of individual Notch receptors revealed that Notch1 and Notch2 receptors differentially contributed to GBM cell growth, with Notch2 having a predominant role. Furthermore, blockade of Notch signaling inhibited the proliferation of human GBM-derived neurospheres in vitro and in vivo. Our overall data indicate that Notch signaling contributes significantly to optimal GBM growth, strongly supporting that the Notch pathway is a promising therapeutic target for GBM.
Minaprine (3-[2-morpholino-ethlamino]-4-methyl-6-phenyl-pyridazine dihydrochloride; 30038CM; trade name in France: Cantor) is a new psychotropic drug. The therapeutic profile of minaprine differs from that of other known psychotropic agents; in man the drug antagonizes the "inhibitory syndrome" characterized by decreased spontaneous activity, reduction in basic drives, slowed thoughts, feelings of tiredness and social withdrawal. Preliminary clinical trials have indicated that minaprine may also be effective in certain depressive states. This finding prompted us to study the effects of minaprine in animal models for depression. Like most antidepressants minaprine antagonizes behavioral despair, but the effect exhibits a slow onset and maximal activity is reached 24 h after administration. Minaprine also antagonizes reserpine-induced ptosis, this effect has a rapid onset, and is long-lasting. In contrast, minaprine poorly antagonizes reserpine-induced hypothermia. Unlike most antidepressants minaprine does not potentiate yohimbine-induced lethality. Minaprine potently antagonizes prochlorperazine-induced catalepsy in rats and potentiates amphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior, suggesting that the drug may enhance dopaminergic transmission. Finally, minaprine does not antagonize either oxotremorine-induced tremors or physiostigmine-induced lethality. Taken together the results of the present study indicate that minaprine is active on certain, but not all, animal models for depression and suggest the drug may have a potential clinical utility in the treatment of human depressions.
The present study investigated the potential of intravesical instillation for localized reduction of NGF (nerve growth factor) expression in the urinary bladder. Overexpression of NGF has been linked to the pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC). A minimum free energy algorithm was used to predict suitable regions in mRNA of rat betaNGF, which can be targeted for an antisense approach. The candidate antisense oligos were evaluated for their ability to reduce NGF expression in vitro by cotransfecting HEK293 cells with NGF cDNA. A single oligonucleotide ODN sequence was chosen for testing in an acute cystitis model in rat induced by cyclophosphamide. Overexpression of NGF is known to mediate inflammation of bladder in this model. For improved stability, antisense ODN was replaced with antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and its penetration into bladder was facilitated by tethering TAT peptide sequence. Rat bladders were instilled with either antisense or its scrambled control prior to cystitis induction. Cystometrograms performed on rats under urethane anaesthesia exhibited bladder contraction frequency that was significantly decreased in the antisense treated rats than rats treated with the control. NGF immunoreactivity was also decreased in the urothelium of the antisense treated bladders. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using TAT-PNA conjugates for intravesical antisense therapy.
Effect of indoor air pollution (IAP) on birth weight remains largely unexplored but yet purported as the most important environmental exposure for pregnant women in developing countries due to the effects of second-hand smoke. We investigated the associations between the determinants of indoor air quality in households and birth weight.
A cross-sectional study of 592 mothers and their newborns using postnatal services at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital located in Accra, Ghana was conducted in 2010 to collect information on characteristics of indoor environment and other potential determinants of fetal growth. Birth weight was recorded from hospital records.
Household cooking fuel choices and garbage burning practices were determinants of birth weight. Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusting for age, social class, marital status and gravidity of mothers, and sex of neonate resulted in a 243 g (95% CI: 496, 11) and 178g (95% CI: 421, 65) reduction in birth weight for use of charcoal, and garbage burning respectively compared with use of LPG only. The estimated reductions in birth weight was not statistically significant. Applying the ordinal scale exposure parameter nonetheless revealed a significant exposure-response relationship between maternal exposures from charcoal use and garbage burning, and birth weight. Generalized linear models adjusting for confounders resulted in a 41% (risk ratio [RR] = 1.41; 95% CI: 0.62, 3.23) and 195% (RR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.10, 7.92) increase in the risk of low birth weight (LBW) for use of charcoal, and garbage burning respectively compared with use of LPG only. A combination of charcoal use and household garbage burning during pregnancy on fetal growth resulted in a 429 g (95% CI: 259, 599) reduction in birth weight and 316% (RR=4.16; 95% CI: 2.02, 8.59) excess risk of LBW. Sensitivity analysis performed by restricting the analysis to term births produced similar results.
Maternal use of charcoal as a cooking fuel during pregnancy and burning of garbage at home are strong determinants of average fetal growth and risk of LBW. Efforts to reduce maternal exposures to IAP are thus important to improve birth outcomes.
The pharmacological activities of herbal extracts can be enhanced by complex formation. In this study, we manipulated cyanidin and delphinidin-rich extracts to form an anthocyanin complex (AC) with turmeric and evaluated activity against inflammation and periductal fibrosis in Opisthorchis viverrini-infected hamsters. The AC was prepared from anthocyanins extracted from cobs of purple waxy corn (70%), petals of blue butterfly pea (20%) and turmeric extract (10%), resulting in an enhanced free-radical scavenging capacity. Oral administration of AC (175 and 700 mg/kg body weight) every day for 1 month to O. viverrini-infected hamsters resulted in reduced inflammatory cells and periductal fibrosis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and partial least square discriminant analysis suggested nucleic acid changes in the O. viverrini-infected liver samples, which were partially prevented by the AC treatment. AC reduced 8-oxodG formation, an oxidative DNA damage marker, significantly decreased levels of nitrite in the plasma and alanine aminotransferase activity and increased the ferric reducing ability of plasma. AC also decreased the expression of oxidant-related genes (NF-κB and iNOS) and increased the expression of antioxidant-related genes (CAT, SOD, and GPx). Thus, AC increases free-radical scavenging capacity, decreases inflammation, suppresses oxidative/nitrative stress, and reduces liver injury and periductal fibrosis in O. viverrini-infected hamsters.
Ibuprofen is a member of the propionic acid class of NSAID. We report a 35-year-old man with ibuprofen-induced acute severe cholestatic liver injury. He recovered after seven months.
Hypervitaminosis A may be associated with benign intracranial hypertension. So far, the explanation for this phenomenon has remained obscure. A 17-year-old patient with benign intracranial hypertension, following chronic vitamin A intake of 150,000 units daily for acne vulgaris, is presented. Bilateral papilledema was present and bilateral obstruction of the transverse sinuses was demonstrated in the late venous phase of cerebral angiography. Discontinuation of vitamin A and acetazolamide treatment was followed by complete regression of the signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Bilateral sinus obstruction with interference of cerebral sinus outflow is suggested as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of benign intracranial hypertension in vitamin A intoxication. Menstrual dysfunction and tetracycline therapy cannot be completely excluded as possible causative factors.
Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). With their widespread use, there is a growing body of literature describing adverse outcomes, including severe thrombocytopenia. Here we report a case of a 75-year-old man who presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, underwent primary PCI and stenting, and subsequently developed profound thrombocytopenia and thrombosis after eptifibatide administration. This report adds to the literature regarding eptifibatide-induced thrombocytopenia and also raises the possibility of a new syndrome of eptifibatide-induced thrombosis. A case is made to examine available databases for thrombosis after administration of eptifibatide and other GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors.
Olanzapine is a newly developed atypical neuroleptic with a marked affinity to the 5-HT2, D2 and D4 dopamine receptors. Like other atypical neuroleptics olanzapine is considered to show a reduced prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects when compared to classical neuroleptic drugs. We report on three patients with acute schizophrenia, who developed severe akathisia during treatment with olanzapine (20-25 mg/d). In two of these cases akathisia resolved after withdrawal of olanzapine and substitution by a classical or an atypical neuroleptic agent, respectively. In one of these patients olanzapine was well tolerated when reintroduced in combination with lorazepam after complete remission of akathisia. In the third patient akathisia was sufficiently controlled by dose reduction. Akathisia is generally considered to result from D2 dopamine receptor antagonism. In the case of atypical neuroleptics such as olanzapine a low but still considerable D2 dopamine receptor occupancy may be compensated by the 5-HT2 antagonism. However, this mechanism may fail under certain circumstances, in particular if D2 dopamine antagonism exceeds a certain threshold. One should therefore be aware of possible extrapyramidal side effects with olanzapine that are reduced compared to classical neuroleptic drugs but not completely eliminated.
Standard toxicological assays using the zebrafish model system evaluate lethality and teratogenicity upon exposure during the first 2 days after fertilization. We tested the biological effects of several widely used drugs on zebrafish by acute treatment for 24 h starting at late embryonic stages, between 48 and 72 h post-fertilization. For 4 out of 6 compounds, we observed a higher sensitivity of late stage zebrafish embryos for general toxicity (lethality) compared to younger embryos. Morphological defects such as edema, body curvature, delayed growth, decreased heart rate and locomotion were observed for each of the compounds tested, often at sublethal concentrations. Gene expression studies on a set of four selected genes revealed a specific regulatory pattern for the different compounds tested. Our results allow us to compare various toxicological endpoints and may contribute to the design of a rational high throughput approach using the zebrafish model.
The application of BCNU, CCNU and MeCCNU has been shown to greatly reduce the number of tumors induced in rats by transplacentally administered ENU and to inhibit the full development of tumor proliferation. Moreover, no neurinomas appeared after treatment with CCNU. The application of GCNU proved to be much less effective. Our statistics in the form of tables showing these findings are included and discussed.
Refractory shock from anaphylaxis can occur after induction of general anesthesia. We report two cases of fatal cardiac arrest with increased blood tryptase and immunoglobulin E values after succinylcholine administration. Tryptase and immunoglobulin E assays may help to identify anaphylactic reactions when cardiac arrest occurs at induction of anesthesia.
Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is a ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutant. BaP is a known carcinogen and can induce malignant transformation of rodent and human cells. Many evidences suggest that inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is potent anticancer drug candidate. However, the effect of PARG on BaP carcinogenesis remains unclear. We explored this question in a PARG-deficient human bronchial epithelial cell line (shPARG cells) treated with various concentration of BaP for 15 weeks. Soft agar assay was used to examine BaP-induced cell malignancy of human bronchial epithelial cells and shPARG cells. Mechanistic investigations were used by 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis and Double immunofluorescence detection were used to confirm some of the results obtained from DIGE experiments. We found that PARG silencing could dramatically inhibit BaP-induced cell malignancy of human bronchial epithelial cells in soft agar assay. Altered levels of expression induced by BaP were observed within shPARG cells for numerous proteins, including proteins required for cell mobility, stress response, DNA repair and cell proliferation pathways. Among these proteins, TCTP and Cofilin-1 involved in malignancy, were validated by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. PARG inhibition contributed to down-regulation of TCTP and Cofilin-1. This is the first experimental demonstration of a link between PARG silencing and reduced cell migration after BaP exposure. We propose that PARG silencing might down-regulate TCTP and Cofilin-1 associated with metastasis in BaP carcinogenesis.
These experiments were carried out to supplement the pharmacodynamic profile of 2[1-(2,6-dichlorophenoxy)-ethyl]-2-imidazoline hydrochloride (lofexidine, Lofetensin and Loxacor), a potent hypotensive imidazoline derivative with a central mode of action. Effects indicative of a central sedative action were seen in various experiments on mice and rats. However, comparative studies with clonidine, particularly those involving the interaction with hexobarbital, the effect on motor coordination on a rotating rod, the effect on body temperature and other experiments, indicated that lofexidine had a 10 to 100 fold less sedative effect than clonidine, depending on the test and the route of administration. In rats there was a dose-related, diuretic and saluretic effect. This effect was not seen in dogs. In rabbits and guinea pigs, lofexidine exhibited local anaesthetic effects and its potency and duration of action were comparable to those of the reference compounds (tetracaine or mepivacaine). Lofexidine did not modify gastric secretion in rats. On the other hand, it inhibited chemically induced (phenylbutazone) and stress-induced (swimming) gastric ulcer formation in rats. Antiinflammatory and analgesic activities in rats and mice were, at most, very weak. Lofexidine increased blood glucose levels of normoglycaemic rats; clonidine is known to have the same effect. In order to investigate the possibility of combining lofexidine with a diuretic drug for the treatment of hypertension, the interaction with hydrochlorothiazide was studied in some experiments. The results obtained from these experiments showed that there was no adverse effect and the diuretic and saluretic effects of hydrochlorothiazide were not impaired. No findings militated against the use of lofexidine as an antihypertensive drug. It is likely that lofexidine, in contrast to clonidine, has less marked central sedative effects.
The oral administration of disopyramide for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion from atrial fibrillation resulted in prolongation of the Q-T interval and three episodes of ventricular tachycardia with the torsade de pointes morphology. This morphology is characteristic of the arrhythmias of quinidine 'syncope'. Its appearance with disopyramide is not unexpected in view of the quinidine-like effects of the latter and suggests that it should be prescribed with the same caution as quinidine.
Amitriptyline poisoning is associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Standard treatment is sodium bicarbonate but further intervention may be necessary. The present study compared the actions of lidocaine and magnesium sulfate on ventricular tachycardia induced by amitriptyline.
Nonrandomized, controlled, intervention trial.
University laboratory.
Thirty male Wistar rats anesthetized with pentobarbital and mechanically ventilated.
After pretreatment with norepinephrine, the animals were subjected to a continuous infusion of amitriptyline. After the appearance of ventricular tachycardia, they were treated with magnesium sulfate (45 mg/kg + 15 mg/kg/min) or lidocaine (1 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg/min) or glucose infusion as a control.
In the group treated with magnesium sulfate, electrocardiogram tracings demonstrated that nine of ten animals converted from ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm compared with one of ten in both the lidocaine- and glucose-treated groups (p < .001). The animals treated with magnesium sulfate also had a significantly longer total time in sinus rhythm (10.0 +/- 1.6 mins) than those rats treated with lidocaine (1.7 +/- 1.5 mins) or glucose (1.5 +/- 1.5 mins). Magnesium sulfate significantly decreased blood pressure and heart rate, but no severe hemodynamic side effects were observed.
Magnesium sulfate is effective in converting ventricular tachycardia in hyperadrenergic amitriptyline poisoning. In contrast, lidocaine had no effect on arrhythmias.
Adverse effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are frequently seen because of the extremely widespread use of these agents. Nephrotoxicity is relatively uncommon with the drug ibuprofen and, when present, is usually rapidly reversible. Fatal acute renal failure from ibuprofen has never been reported. This is the case of a patient with multiple medical problems who had near-fatal acute renal failure after the ingestion of 36 g ibuprofen, and who required dialysis for several months, at which point renal function improved. He did not admit to ibuprofen ingestion at the time of admission, and some of the clinical manifestations, including anion gap metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and mental status abnormalities, could be accounted for by renal failure. Hence, this diagnosis was not considered during admission. However, the patient admitted to ibuprofen ingestion after his mental status improved with hemodialysis. A number of other variables were present that probably contributed to the development of acute renal failure, such as the presence of long-term renal insufficiency, hypotension, and possibly other drug ingestion. Acute renal failure with massive ibuprofen ingestion may be fatal or may show delayed reversibility even after necessitating dialysis for several months.
1. The dose-response relationship and duration of action of 3'-acetyl-4'-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropyl)-butyranilide (acebutolol, Prent) were determined under double-blind conditions in 9 volunteers using heart rate at rest and during exercise as a test parameter. 2. The effect of 200 mg of acebutolol on ischemic ST-segment depression, heart rate, and blood pressure was investigated in 10 patients with coronary heart disease. 3. Heart rate at rest and while standing was most markedly reduced in the volunteers 3 h following ingestion of acebutolol 300 mg. 100 and 300 mg lowered heart rate during exercise by 9.9 and 18.9%, respectively. No significant additional effect was achieved by increasing the dosage to 500 mg. 4. 24 h after single oral doses of 300 and 500 mg of acebutolol, nearly 50% of the substance's activity was still evident. 5. In patients with coronary heart disease, maximum heart rate during exercise 3 h after oral intake of 200 mg declined by 13%. The heart rate sum during ergometry fell by 11.2%. Systolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise also was lower. 6. A single oral dose of 100-300 mg of acebutolol consistently reduces heart rate during exercise as well as exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Since the drug remains active over a 24-h period, administration once daily should provide an adequate therapeutic effect in many patients.
Usnic acid (UA), a natural botanical product, is a constituent of some dietary supplements used for weight loss. It has been associated with clinical hepatotoxicity leading to liver failure in humans. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the interactive toxicity, if any, of UA with lipopolysaccarides (LPS), a potential contaminant of food, at low non-toxic concentrations. The human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells were treated with the vehicle control and test agents, separately and in a binary mixture, for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. After the treatment period, the cells were evaluated by the traditional biochemical endpoints of toxicity in combination with the toxicogenomic endpoints that included cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury and changes in pathway-focused gene expression profiles. Compared with the controls, low non-toxic concentrations of UA and LPS separately showed no effect on the cells as determined by the biochemical endpoints. However, the simultaneous mixed exposure of the cells to their binary mixture resulted in increased cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury. The pathway-focused gene expression analysis resulted in the altered expression of several genes out of 84 genes examined. Most altered gene expressions induced by the binary mixture of UA and LPS were different from those induced by the individual constituents. The genes affected by the mixture were not modulated by either UA or LPS. The results of the present study suggest that the interactions of low nontoxic concentrations of UA and LPS produce toxicity in HepG2 cells.
Metoclopramide hydrochloride, a neuroleptic dopamine receptor antagonist used to treat gastric ailments, is reported to cause extrapyramidal movement disorders. The goals of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence and severity of tardive dyskinesia and acute extrapyramidal movement syndromes including akathisia, acute dystonia, and drug-induced parkinsonism in metoclopramide-treated patients and (2) to compare the prevalence and severity of tardive dyskinesia in metoclopramide-treated diabetics and nondiabetics.
From a list of metoclopramide-treated patients received from the Portland (Ore) Veterans Affairs Medical Center pharmacy, 53 patients met inclusion criteria and 51 (96%) agreed to participate. Controls consisted of a convenience sample drawn from the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center Outpatient Clinic who were matched to subjects on age (+/- 10 years), gender, and presence or absence of diabetes. Of 61 potential controls contacted, 51 (84%) agreed to participate. Metoclopramide-treated subjects and controls were seen by a rater who was "blind" to all diagnoses and treatments. The rater performed a standardized examination used to elicit signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia and acute extrapyramidal movement syndromes.
The relative risk for tardive dyskinesia was 1.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.93 to 2.97), and the relative risk for drug-induced parkinsonism was 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 10.5). Metoclopramide-treated patients had significantly greater severity of tardive dyskinesia, drug-induced parkinsonism, and subjective akathisia than controls. Use of metoclopramide was associated with impairment in ambulation and increased use of benzodiazepines. Metoclopramide-treated diabetics had significantly greater severity of tardive dyskinesia than metoclopramide-treated nondiabetics.
Metoclopramide use is associated with a significantly increased prevalence and severity of several extrapyramidal movement disorders.
