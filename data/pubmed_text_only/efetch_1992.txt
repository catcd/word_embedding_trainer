Lithium can have toxic effects on the central nervous system that are both acute and chronic. Uncommonly, a long-lasting cerebellar syndrome follows acute toxicity. The mechanism of cerebellar injury is not well understood. We present 3 cases of this syndrome, with video demonstrating the typical features of this syndrome.
Tinnitus or subjective hearing loss, or both, were reported by 61 of 134 (45%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) taking regular salicylates and by 73 of 182 (40%) untreated healthy subjects. In the patients with RA mean salicylate levels were not higher in those with tinnitus than in those without tinnitus, but levels were significantly higher in those with subjective hearing loss than in those with no symptoms. Twenty five per cent of the patients with RA had tinnitus or subjective hearing loss with salicylate levels less than 1.42 mmol/l. Audiometric responses in 31 patients correlated poorly with symptoms. Tinnitus and subjective hearing loss may be too non-specific to be reliable as tools for adjusting the salicylate level into the therapeutic range.
Our work suggests an important new link between the RCAN1 gene and Huntington disease. Huntington disease is caused by expansion of glutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein. How the huntingtin protein with expanded polyglutamines (mutant huntingtin) causes the disease is still unclear, but phosphorylation of huntingtin appears to be protective. Increased huntingtin phosphorylation can be produced either by inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin or by activation of the Akt kinase. The RCAN1 gene encodes regulators of calcineurin, and we now demonstrate, for the first time, that RCAN1-1L is depressed in Huntington disease. We also show that RCAN1-1L overexpression can protect against mutant huntingtin toxicity in an ST14A cell culture model of Huntington disease and that increased phosphorylation of huntingtin via calcineurin inhibition, rather than via Akt induction or activation, is the likely mechanism by which RCAN1-1L may be protective against mutant huntingtin. These findings suggest that RCAN1-1L "deficiency" may actually play a role in the etiology of Huntington disease. In addition, our results allow for the possibility that controlled overexpression of RCAN1-1L in the striatal region of the brain might be a viable avenue for therapeutic intervention in Huntington disease patients (and perhaps other polyglutamine expansion disorders).
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) can be a devastating lung disease. It is primarily caused by inflammation leading to severe damage of the alveolar epithelial cells. The pathophysiology of PF is not yet been clearly defined, but studying lung parenchymal injury by involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) may provide promising results. PAR-2 is a G-protein coupled receptor is known to play an important role in the development of PF. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory role of diallylsulfide (DAS) against ROS mediated activation of PAR-2 and collagen production accompanied by epithelial cell apoptosis. Bleomycin induced ROS levels may prompt to induce the expression of PAR-2 as well as extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), such as MMP 2 and 9, collagen specific proteins HSP-47, Î±-SMA, and cytokines IL-6, and IL-8RA. Importantly DAS treatment effectively decreased the expression of all these proteins. The inhibitory effect of DAS on profibrotic molecules is mediated by blocking the ROS level. To identify apoptotic signaling as a mediator of PF induction, we performed apoptotic protein expression, DNA fragmentation analysis and ultrastructural details of the lung tissue were performed. DAS treatment restored all these changes to near normalcy. In conclusion, treatment of PF bearing rats with DAS results in amelioration of the ROS production, PAR-2 activation, ECM production, collagen synthesis and alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis during bleomycin induction. We attained the first evidence that treatment of DAS decreases the ROS levels and may provide a potential therapeutic effect attenuating bleomycin induced PF.
Sertraline dose-dependently increased the locomotor stimulating effect of amphetamine. At the highest dose, 20 mg/kg sertraline had a biphasic effect on amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, producing an initial reduction in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity that was later followed by an augmentation of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in the last hour of the 3-h test. Sertraline, at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg, produced an augmentation of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity over the last 2 h of the 3-h test session. Further, there was an increase in the concentration of amphetamine in the brain in rats pretreated with 5 mg/kg sertraline. Both sertraline (5 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) produced an augmentation of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity that was unaltered by a serotonergic lesion of the median and dorsal raphe nuclei that resulted in a greater than 90% depletion of serotonin in hippocampus, striatum, and nucleus accumbens. Further, both sertraline and fluoxetine inhibited spontaneous locomotor activity and this effect was also unaltered by the depletion of serotonin. Thus, serotonergic neurotransmission is not essential for the effects of sertraline and fluoxetine on spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotion. It is probable that sertraline and fluoxetine augment the locomotor stimulatory effect of amphetamine by decreasing the metabolism of amphetamine, perhaps via actions on cytochrome P450 isozymes.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in the environment as components of fossil fuels and by-products of combustion. These multi-ring chemicals differentially activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in a structurally dependent manner, and induce toxicity via both AHR-dependent and -independent mechanisms. PAH exposure is known to induce developmental malformations in zebrafish embryos, and recent studies have shown cardiac toxicity induced by compounds with low AHR affinity. Unraveling the potentially diverse molecular mechanisms of PAH toxicity is essential for understanding the hazard posed by complex PAH mixtures present in the environment. We analyzed transcriptional responses to PAH exposure in zebrafish embryos exposed to benz(a)anthracene (BAA), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and pyrene (PYR) at concentrations that induced developmental malformations by 120 h post-fertilization (hpf). Whole genome microarray analysis of mRNA expression at 24 and 48 hpf identified genes that were differentially regulated over time and in response to the three PAH structures. PAH body burdens were analyzed at both time points using GC-MS, and demonstrated differences in PAH uptake into the embryos. This was important for discerning dose-related differences from those that represented unique molecular mechanisms. While BAA misregulated the least number of transcripts, it caused strong induction of cyp1a and other genes known to be downstream of the AHR, which were not induced by the other two PAHs. Analysis of functional roles of misregulated genes and their predicted regulatory transcription factors also distinguished the BAA response from regulatory networks disrupted by DBT and PYR exposure. These results indicate that systems approaches can be used to classify the toxicity of PAHs based on the networks perturbed following exposure, and may provide a path for unraveling the toxicity of complex PAH mixtures.
A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an immunostimulant, Ribomunyl, in the prevention of recurrences of infectious rhinitis in adults. This trial involved 327 patients (168 Ribomunyl treated and 159 placebo cases) with an average of 4.3 +/- 1.8 rhinitis episodes per patient recorded during the year preceding the study. The main criterion of efficacy was the cumulative number of recurrences of infectious rhinitis during a 6-month follow-up period, as analyzed by standard tests. An additional analysis of relative risk of recurrences used multivariate failure for time data. Ribomunyl was effective throughout the study period, starting from the first month of treatment: a mean of 1.0 +/- 1.1 recurrences was recorded in the Ribomunyl group as compared to 1.5 +/- 1.4 recurrences in the placebo group; this indicated one-third fewer infections (P = 0.001). The protective effect of Ribomunyl on the relative risk for recurrences was estimated to be 0.58 by multivariate analysis (95% CI: 0.43-0.78, P = 0.0001). Analysis of secondary criteria also favored Ribomunyl: 38.5% less antibiotic courses per patient (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 1.3 +/- 1.6; P = 0.002) and the number of days with antibiotics (5.6 +/- 9.3 vs 9.1 +/- 12.1; P = 0.002).
Total, cell-free, and cell-bound endotoxin and bacterial density were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 22 children with Hemophilus influenzae meningitis. Also the effect of ceftriaxone on CSF endotoxin levels was investigated in eight patients by reexamining their CSF 2-6 h after the initial dose. Initial CSF bacterial density correlated with initial CSF endotoxin levels (P less than .001). Ceftriaxone induced a marked increase of free endotoxin in CSF, from an initial (mean +/- SE) 0.75 +/- 0.21 to 1.29 +/- 0.23 log10 ng/ml (P less than .01). This increase correlated positively with the number of bacteria killed in the CSF (P less than .01). The increase in free endotoxin was associated with an increase in mean CSF lactate levels from 8.5 to 9.7 units/l (P less than .05) and mean lactate dehydrogenase levels from 102 to 180 mmol/l (P less than .02) and a decrease in mean CSF glucose from 1.17 to 0.46 mmol/l (P less than .05). Initial CSF total endotoxin concentrations correlated both with the Herson-Todd clinical severity score (P less than .001) and with the number of febrile hospital days (P less than .001). These findings suggest that highly bactericidal agents initially lead to release of free endotoxin from gram-negative organisms into CSF, with associated enhanced inflammatory response by the host.
It is important to assess cardiovascular risk factors to properly verify the potential consequences of atypical antipsychotic-related weight gain. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether 2 atypical antipsychotics differ regarding their impact on the cardiovascular disease risk profile compared with a reference group.
We conducted a cross-sectional, multicenter study to assess anthropometric indices of obesity and to obtain a comprehensive fasting metabolic risk profile. Either risperidone or olanzapine had to be prescribed as the first and only antipsychotic for a minimum of 6 months. Patients were compared with a reference group of nondiabetic men. Data were collected from August 1999 to August 2001.
Eighty-seven patients treated with olanzapine (N = 42) or risperidone (N = 45) were evaluated. Olanzapine-treated patients had significantly higher plasma triglyceride concentrations (2.01 +/-1.05 vs. 1.34 +/-0.65 mmol/L, p < or =.05), lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (0.92 +/-0.17 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.21 mmol/L, p < or =.05), higher cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios (5.62 +/-1.70 vs. 4.50 +/- 1.44, p < or =.05), higher apolipoprotein B levels (1.07 +/- 0.35 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.27 g/L, p < or =.05), smaller low-density lipoprotein peak particle diameters (252.6 +/-4.1 vs. 255.2 +/-4.3 A, p <.01), and higher fasting insulin concentrations (103.9 +/- 67.6 vs. 87.5 +/- 56.1 pmol/L, p < or =.05) than risperidone-treated patients. Moreover, 33% of olanzapine-treated patients were carriers of 3 atherogenic features of the metabolic syndrome as opposed to a prevalence of only 11% of risperidone-treated patients.
These results suggest that olanzapine-treated patients are characterized by a more deteriorated metabolic risk factor profile compared with risperidone-treated patients. These observations raise concerns about the potential differential long-term deleterious effects of some antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, on cardiovascular health.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are frequently administered in patients with heart disease, have a known inhibitory effect on erythropoiesis. The aim of this study was to detect whether early ACE inhibitor administration slows recovery from anemia following recent cardiac surgery.
Forty male patients with anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL) an average of 9 days after cardiac surgery were randomized to receive enalapril (ACE inhibitor group) or not. All of the patients received ferrous sulfate, 525 mg, in addition to standard therapy. Patients with anemia due to other causes were excluded. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, and after 8 days, 16 days, and 60 days. A 6-min walking test and echocardioscan were performed at baseline, and after 16 days and 60 days of treatment, and a chest radiograph was obtained at baseline and after 60 days. The ACE inhibitor group showed a statistically significant lower increase in hemoglobin and RBC values. The peak between-group differences of 1 g/dL of hemoglobin (p = 0.012) and 444 RBCs per milliliter (p = 0.017) were observed on day 16.
Early enalapril maleate administration in anemic patients after heart surgery significantly inhibits erythropoiesis. This unfavorable effect on anemia should be considered when prescribing ACE inhibitors for such patients.
We present an unusual case of indomethacin-induced occlusion of the fetal ductus arteriosus, which occurred in one of twins. In fetal echocardiography, the characteristic findings, a to and fro regurgitation pattern at pulmonary valve and postvalvular dilation of the main pulmonary artery, were obtained in addition to right ventricular dilation and hypertrophy, tricuspid regurgitation, right atrium dilation, and pericardial effusion. This fetus developed fetal distress and was delivered by an emergency cesarean section at 35 weeks' gestation. We suggest that these fetal echocardiographic findings may be the end-stage signs of the fetal ductal occlusion as well as the signs for emergent delivery.
During a one-year period analgesic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-(NSAID) associated acute renal failure (ARF) was recorded in 147 of 398 patients registered in 58 nephrology units. This figure represented 36.9% of drug-associated ARF, and 6.8% of total patients with ARF hospitalized during the same period. Drugs involved were primarily glafenin (79), NSAID (62), paracetamol (5) and phenacetin (1 case). Hypersensitivity reactions were documented in 32 patients. Acute tubular necrosis was found in 20, and interstitial nephritis (AIN) in 9 of 34 biopsied patients. All patients in the glafenin group and 71.4% in the NSAID group recovered fully or regained previous renal function (p less than 0.01). Permanent renal damage (9.5% of total cases) was more frequent in patients with AIN than in those with other types of ARF (p less than 0.001). Preventive measures should be especially directed to older patients receiving NSAID, by avoiding the combined use of drugs potentiating their action and by correcting any predisposing factor to ARF.
To examine the protective effects of histamine on intestinal damage produced by gamma-radiation.
56 mice were divided into 4 groups. Histamine and Histamine-10 Gy groups received a daily subcutaneous histamine injection (0.1 mg/kg) starting 20 hours before irradiation and continued until the end of the experimental period; the untreated group received saline. Histamine-10 Gy and untreated-10 Gy groups were irradiated with a single dose on whole-body using Cesium-137 source (7 Gy/min) and were sacrificed 3 days after irradiation. Small intestine was removed, fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The number of intestinal crypts per circumference, and other histological characteristics of intestinal cells were evaluated. We further determined by immunohistochemistry the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bax, Bcl-2 (pro- and anti-apoptotic protein, respectively), antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase and Glutathione peroxidase), histamine content and apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Cells in the S phase of the cell cycle were identified by immunohistochemical detection of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation.
Histamine treatment reduced mucosal atrophy, edema and preserved villi, crypts and nuclear and cytoplasmic characteristics of small intestine after radiation exposure. Additionally, histamine treatment increased PCNA expression and the BrdU-positive cell number, histamine content, decreased the number of apoptotic cells and significantly increased Catalase and copper-zinc-containing SOD of irradiated mice.
Histamine prevents radiation-induced toxicity by increasing proliferation of damaged intestinal mucosa and suppressing apoptosis that was associated with an increase in SOD and Catalase levels. This effect might be of clinical value in patients undergoing radiotherapy.
Chemical modifications of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide that result in increased potency and resistance to degradation have recently lead to the discovery of [(pF)Phe(4)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (UFP-112), a novel N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor agonist. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological profile of intrathecally administered UFP-112 in monkeys under different behavioral assays. Intrathecal UFP-112 (1-10 nmol) dose-dependently produced antinociception against an acute noxious stimulus (50 degrees C water) and capsaicin-induced thermal hyperalgesia. Intrathecal UFP-112-induced antinociception could be reversed by a NOP receptor antagonist, J-113397 (0.1mg/kg), but not by a classic opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (0.03 mg/kg). Like intrathecal morphine, UFP-112 produced antinociception in two primate pain models with a similar magnitude of effectiveness and a similar duration of action that last for 4-5h. Unlike intrathecal morphine, UFP-112 did not produce itch/scratching responses. In addition, intrathecal inactive doses of UFP-112 and morphine produced significant antinociceptive effects when given in combination without increasing scratching responses. These results demonstrated that intrathecal UFP-112 produced long-lasting morphine-comparable antinociceptive effects without potential itch side effect. This study is the first to provide functional evidence that selective NOP receptor agonists such as UFP-112 alone or in conjunction with morphine may improve the quality of spinal analgesia.
Brivaracetam (BRV) is a new anticonvulsant under development. Although BRV is an analog of levetiracetam (LEV), in addition to being an SV2A ligand, it also inhibits sodium channels in a voltage-dependent manner. The cognitive effects of BRV are uncertain.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way cross-over design was employed in 16 healthy volunteers comparing acute dosing (i.e., two doses) of BRV 10 mg, LEV 500 mg, lorazepam (LZP) 2 mg, and placebo. The primary outcome was the summary score from the cognitive neurophysiologic test (CNT), which combines electrophysiologic and performance measures. Secondary outcomes included CNT cognitive and electrophysiologic subscores, traditional neuropsychological measures, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
Compared to BRV, LEV, and placebo, LZP adversely affected the CNT summary score and the majority of CNT subscores and neuropsychological measures. In contrast, BRV did not differ from placebo or LEV on any measure. More TEAEs occurred with LZP compared to each of the other treatment conditions.
The differential pattern of drug effects was consistent across multiple electrophysiologic, cognitive, and subjective measures. The profile of cognitive, subjective, and electrophysiologic effects for BRV was similar to the analog compound LEV and to placebo. The findings suggest that BRV should be tolerated well from a neuropsychological perspective, but additional studies are needed.
Latent or manifest chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE) symptomatology often includes affective symptoms. It is therefore warranted to investigate the functional outcome of novel antidepressants when chronic HE prevails.
Portacaval shunt (PCS) in rats is a widely used experimental model for chronic HE, a neuropsychiatric syndrome accompanying liver dysfunction. HE is believed to arise from a primary alteration in neurotransmission in the CNS. PCS has been reported to increase the metabolism of serotonin in the brain, and thus the central serotonin nerve of PCS rats may contain more serotonin than normal. However, the functional relevance of this serotonergic alteration in terms of affecting behavioral performance of PCS rats has been only rarely studied.
Locomotor and rearing activities were recorded in PCS and sham-operated control rats. A single subcutaneous challenge with saline versus either the mixed serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine (10 mg x kg(-1)) or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram (5 mg x kg(-1)) were performed.
The PCS-saline injected rats showed reduced locomotor and rearing activity compared with sham-saline treated rats. While no significant differences could be observed following the venlafaxine challenge to controls, the PCS-venlafaxine challenged rats displayed reduced behavioral activity as compared to PCS-saline treated rats. The PCS-citalopram rats, however, displayed increased activity compared with the PCS-saline rats while, again, no effect of the citalopram challenge to controls was found.
The present study show altered but opposite behavior in PCS rats, when challenged with either venlafaxine or citalopram, compared to PCS control rats. These findings therefore support the contention that caution should be advocated when CNS monoamine active drugs are used in liver-impaired subjects until better delineation of the combined pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic outcome for each such drug in this condition has been made.
Nitrates of theophylline derivatives - potential nitric oxide (NO) donors - were synthesized by esterification of 7-hydroxyalkyl theophylline derivatives with fuming nitric acid. The nitrates obtained were tested in-vitro in reactions with sulfydryl compounds at appropriately adjusted pH and temperature. Under the applied conditions, the synthesized compounds underwent decomposition to release NO, quantified using a polarographic method using a selective isolated (ISO-NO) sensor. The effects of dyphylline and proxyphylline and their new synthesized nitrates on arterial blood pressure (BP) were measured in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. BP was measured in conscious SH rats using the tail-cuff method. Both short- and long-term administration of the xanthines tested significantly decreased systolic, diastolic and mean BP. The hypotensive effect of a single dose of nitrate dyphylline on mean BP was greater than that of the parent compound (P = 0.000012; P=0.000472 at 30 and 60 min post-dose, respectively), whereas proxyphylline and its nitrate derivative had similar activity. In rats treated with the tested compounds for 9 days twice daily, the decrease in BP persisted for at least 16 h after the last dose. Proxyphylline produced the most marked decrease in diastolic and mean BP. Among the xanthines examined, proxyphylline nitrate had the strongest hypotensive effect when administered in a single dose to animals pretreated with the same compound for 9 days. These results indicate that insertion of a nitrate group weakly modifies the hypotensive action of the studied xanthines in SH rats.
We report on the clinical features, management, and outcome of 27 patients with tuberculous disease of the central nervous system admitted to the London Hospital over six years. Seventeen presented with meningitis, and in nine of these there was bacteriological confirmation of tuberculous disease although acid fast bacilli were only found in the CSF of four patients. This appeared to carry a poor prognosis. There was a high incidence of rifampicin-induced hepatitis. The outcome was satisfactory in six out of seven patients in whom no AFBs were cultured. Eleven patients presented with intracranial tuberculomas but without evidence of systemic TB. The CT scan revealed mass lesions, but only in three patients was the appearance pathognomonic of tuberculoma. However, biopsy can be a hazardous procedure and led to the death of two of our patients. Where possible, surgical intervention should be avoided, and the response to medical treatment assessed by CT scan.
Eleven hundred cases of drug induced liver disease have been reported in Denmark from 1978 to 1987, including 52 fatal cases. Approximately 100 new cases have been reported every year since 1987. The definition and classification of drug induced liver disease are presented together with a review of the most common patho-anatomical pictures and pathogenetic mechanisms, followed by a description of symptoms and paraclinical abnormalities for each of the ten most common drugs causing serious liver disease. Individual cases of liver disease caused by paracetamol, sulfamethizole and androgenic steroid hormones are presented. Guidelines to minimize the risk of liver disease when using halothane, disulfiram or methotrexate are mentioned. Finally there are some proposals for diminishing the number of and the severity of drug induced liver disease.
The goal of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of nanocopper-induced nephrotoxicity by analyzing renal gene expression profiles phenotypically anchored to conventional toxicological outcomes. Male Wistar rats were given nanocopper (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) and microcopper (200 mg/kg) at different doses for 5 days. We found nanocopper can induce widespread renal proximal tubule necrosis in rat kidneys with blood urea nitrogen and creatinine increase. Whole genome transcriptome profiling of rat kidneys revealed significant alterations in the expression of many genes involved in valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, complement and coagulation cascades, oxidative phosphorylation, cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, glutathione metabolism, and others may be involved in the development of these phenotypes. Results from this study provide new insights into the nephrotoxicity of copper nano-particles and illustrate how toxicogenomic approaches are providing an unprecedented amount of mechanistic information on molecular responses to nanocopper and how they are likely to impact hazard and risk assessment.
There is a growing body of evidence that serotonergic antidepressants are useful in the treatment of maladaptive behaviours in the intellectually disabled. However, not all studies have shown positive results due to lack of efficacy, tolerance development, and troublesome side-effects. The current study consisted of a review of the treatment response to a variety of serotonergic antidepressants, consisting of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs ) (n = 36) and clomipramine (n = 2) in 38 institutionalized intellectually disabled adults (20 males, 18 females; mean age 45.6 yr, age range 18-74 yr). Those studied were treated for aggression, self-injurious behaviours, destructive/disruptive behaviours, depression/dysphoria, or a combination of these or other challenging behaviours. Most were receiving concurrent psychotropic and/or anticonvulsant medications. Effectiveness was determined by a retrospective review of the summaries of multidisciplinary Neuropsychiatric Behavioural Reviews (NBRs) in which global and specific maladaptive behaviours were rated on a 1- to 7-point scale, and by psychologists' ratings of target behaviours. Overall, statistically significant decreases in the ratings of global maladaptive behaviour and aggression, self-injurious behaviour, destruction/disruption and depression/dysphoria and in psychologists' ratings occurred in the subject group after the initiation of antidepressants. The results suggest that serotonergic antidepressants are useful in the treatment of challenging/maladaptive behaviours in the intellectually disabled.
A 68-year-old black woman who was put on D-penicillamine therapy (250-500 mg per day, total dose 15 g) for rheumatoid arthritis developed ocular myasthenia gravis. Two weeks after she discontinued D-penicillamine her signs and symptoms cleared with no other treatment. Review of previous cases and possible immunological mechanisms are discussed.
Lithospermic acid B (LAB) has been reported to protect OLETF rats, an established type 2 diabetic animal model, from the development of diabetes-related vascular complications. We investigated whether magnesium lithospermate B (LAB) has a protective role under cytokine-induced apoptosis in INS-1 cells in vitro and whether it slows the development of diabetes in OLETF rats in vivo. Pretreatment with 50 Î¼M LAB significantly reduced the 1000 U/mL INF-Î³ and 100 U/mL IL-1Î²-induced INS-1 cell death. LAB significantly alleviated cytokine-induced phosphorylations of p38 and JNK in accordance with a decrease in cleaved caspase-3 activity in beta-cells. LAB also protected against the cytokine-induced caspase-3 apoptotic pathway via significant activation of Nrf2-HO (heme-oxygenase)-1 and Sirt1 expression. OLETF rats treated with 40 mg/kg/day LAB showed a significant improvement in glucose tolerance compared to untreated OLETF control rats in vivo. Our results suggest that the cytoprotective effects of LAB on pancreatic Î²-cells are related with both alleviating apoptotic pathways and activating anti-apoptotic pathways of Nrf2-HO-1 and Sirt1.
Urine profiles (albumin, glucose, NAG, LDH, GGT and sodium) were followed for 9 days after intravenous injection of either diatrizoate, iohexol, or saline in 27 Wistar rats with nephrosis induced by Adriamycin 42 days before. Another 9 rats exposed to neither Adriamycin nor contrast media served as controls. None of the contrast media caused further increased albuminuria of significance, whereas both induced significantly increased excretion of all 5 tubular components. The excretion of NAG and sodium was significantly higher following diatrizoate than following iohexol. From 24 h post injection there was no significantly greater excretion of any of the components after either diatrizoate or iohexol than after saline among the rats given Adriamycin. At the end of day 9 after contrast medium injection neither serum sodium, potassium, glucose, urea, creatinine, nor albumin revealed any contrast media related changes. Kidney histology showed quantitatively larger lesions in kidneys exposed to Adriamycin and contrast media than in kidneys exposed to Adriamycin and saline. There were no differences between the two contrast media groups. It is thus concluded, that both high osmolar ionic and low osmolar non-ionic contrast media cause temporary tubular dysfunction but no further glomerular dysfunction in rats with nephrosis induced by Adriamycin. The histologic findings indicate that both media may worsen non-reversible renal lesions.
A review of studies of mexiletine, a class I antiarrhythmic drug, supports its use in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or in sinus rhythm. Studies include patients likely to receive the drug in clinical use--patients with and without coronary disease and patients who have suffered acute myocardial infarction. Some studies are open and others are controlled to compare mexiletine to placebo or to lidocaine. Mexiletine in therapeutic ranges was shown not to affect arterial pressure; to prolong aortic ball travel time, indicating depression of myocardial contractility; and not to adversely affect cardiac function. Adverse effects occurred as often in patients taking placebo as in mexiletine-treated patients, even in those with impaired cardiac function. Studies bear out early reports of mexiletine as an effective antiarrhythmic drug nearly devoid of adverse hemodynamic effects when administered intravenously or orally in a dosage to maintain a therapeutic plasma concentration.
