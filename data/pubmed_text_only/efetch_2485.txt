The present study investigated the protective effect of Satureja montana extract against cyclophosphamide-induced testicular injury in rats. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extract were 1.03% and 0.34%w/w of dry herb expressed as chlorogenic acid and quercetin, respectively. HPLC analysis identified caffeic, syringic and rosmarinic acids as the chief phenolic acids, and rutin as the major flavonoid in the extract. Oral daily administration of S.montana extract (50mg/kg/day) for 7days before and 7days after an intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (200mg/kg) restored the reduced relative testicular weight, serum testosterone level and testicular alkaline phosphatase activity, raised the lowered testicular sorbitol dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activities, and decreased the elevated testicular hemoglobin absorbance. It also attenuated lipid peroxidation, restored the lowered glutathione content, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities, and improved total antioxidant capacity. Moreover, S.montana extract mitigated testicular DNA fragmentation, decreased the elevated Fas and Bax gene expression, up-regulated the decreased Bcl-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) gene expression and normalized Akt1 protein level. Histopathological investigation confirmed the protective effects of the extract. Conclusively, S.montana extract protects the rat testis against cyclophosphamide-induced damage via anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic mechanisms that seem to be mediated, at least in part, by PPAR-γ and Akt1 up-regulation.
We report on a large family in which a novel X-linked recessive mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome comprising macrocephaly and ciliary dysfunction co-segregates with a frameshift mutation in the OFD1 gene. Mutations of OFD1 have been associated with oral-facial-digital type 1 syndrome (OFD1S) that is characterized by X-chromosomal dominant inheritance and lethality in males. In contrast, the carrier females of our family were clinically inconspicuous, and the affected males suffered from severe mental retardation, recurrent respiratory tract infections and macrocephaly. All but one of the affected males died from respiratory problems in infancy; and impaired ciliary motility was confirmed in the index patient by high-speed video microscopy examination of nasal epithelium. This family broadens the phenotypic spectrum of OFD1 mutations in an unexpected way and sheds light on the complexity of the underlying disease mechanisms.
Various nutrients and plant-derived phytochemicals are associated with a reduced risk of many diet-related chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis and osteoporosis. A common theme that links many chronic diseases is uncontrolled inflammation. The long-chain (LC) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and flavonoids are known to possess anti-inflammatory actions in cell cultures, animal models and humans. Minimizing the condition of persistent inflammation has been a primary aim for drug development, but understanding how food components attenuate this process is at the nexus for improving the human condition. The prevalence of environmental toxins such as heavy metals and organics that contribute to diminished levels of antioxidants likely aggravates inflammatory states when intakes of omega-3 PUFA and flavonoids are marginal. Scientists at Purdue University have formed a collaboration to better understand the metabolism and physiology of flavonoids. This new effort is focused on determining how candidate flavonoids and their metabolites affect gene targets of inflammation in cell culture and animal models. The challenge of this research is to understand how LC omega-3 PUFA and flavonoids affect the biology of inflammation. The goal is to determine how nutrients and phytochemicals attenuate chronic inflammation associated with a number of diet-related diseases that occur throughout the life cycle. The experimental approach involves molecular, biochemical and physiological endpoints of aging, cancer, obesity and musculoskeletal diseases. Examples include investigations on the combined effects of PUFA and cyanidins on inflammatory markers in cultures of human cancer cells. The actions of catechins and PUFA on muscle loss and osteopenia are being studied in a rodent model of disuse atrophy to explain how muscle and bone communicate to prevent tissue loss associated with injury, disease and aging. The purpose of this review is to introduce the concept for studying food components that influence inflammation and how LC omega-3 PUFA and flavonoids could be used therapeutically against inflammation that is mediated by environmental pollutants.
Drug-induced lithiasis was well-known some years ago, when sulfonamides poorly soluble in urine were in use. Now, they are again in use for some opportunistic AIDS-related infections. We report herein the case of an AIDS patient, treated with sulfadiazine because of Nocardia pneumonia, that came to the emergency room in acute renal failure.
Obstructive uropathy due to radiolucent calculi was suspected and retrograde ureteral catheterization was necessary. The calculi recovered were identified as N-acetyl sulfadiazine by infrared spectrophotometry.
Rapid improvement can be achieved in these patients when the drug is discontinued or decrease and systemic fluid and urine alkalinization are started.
To clarify the relationship between blood pressure and pulse wave transit time at the peripheral artery from the R wave of the electrocardiogram (m-PWTT), the effects of cardiovascular interventions on this relationship was evaluated.
Ten mongrel dogs were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, and catheter tip pressure transducers were inserted into the ascending aorta and at the bifurcation of abdominal aorta to measure central and peripheral pulse wave arrival. Pulse wave arrival at the ascending aorta from the R wave represents pre-ejection period (PEP) and pulse wave arrival between the ascending aorta and bifurcation of aorta represents pulse wave transit time (PWTT), thus m-PWTT = PEP + PWTT. Hypertension was induced by the continuous infusion of dobutamine and phenylephrine, and hypotension was induced by deepening isoflurane anesthesia, acute blood loss and nitroglycerine infusion. The relationship between timing components (PWTT, PEP, and m-PWTT) and blood pressure was recorded and analyzed by using the least squares method.
The relationship between timing components (PWTT, PEP and, m-PWTT) and blood pressure was significant and highly correlated. When the change in blood pressure was due to the myocardial contractility, such as after dobutamine infusion, the relationship between all timing components and blood pressure was consistent and negative. However, when the change in blood pressure was due to the vasoactive agents, such as phenylephrine, the relationship between timing components and blood pressure was dependent on the reflex change in PEP.
Change in m-PWTT is a good parameter to predict blood pressure changes, although the absolute blood pressure value cannot be obtained.
A series of 13 cases of occlusions of the posterior cerebral artery are presented as verified by angiography. 9 of these were between the age of 20 and 39. The symptoms and clinical courses are compared with the angiographic findings, especially with the collateral circulation. On the basis of our observations and similar cases reported in the literature the factors, disposing to vascular occlusions are discussed in detail particularly the role of oral contraceptives and nicotine-abuse.
Bicyclol is a novel synthetic drug for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis in China. This paper reports the protective action of bicyclol against experimental liver injury in mice and its mechanism of action. Oral administration of bicyclol markedly reduced the elevated serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) and the hepatic morphologic changes induced by CCl(4) in mice. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that bicyclol significantly inhibited CCl(4)-induced lipid peroxidation of liver microsomes and (14)CCl(4) covalent binding to microsomal lipids and proteins in vitro, and decreased the level of the trichloromethyl free radical (*CCl(3)) generated from CCl(4) metabolism by NADPH-reduced liver microsomes. On the other hand, bicyclol neither directly inhibited the activity of ALT or AST in vitro nor affected hepatic ALT protein content in mice. These results suggest that bicyclol has remarkable hepatoprotective effects and its mechanism of action may be related to a decrease in free radical-induced damage to hepatocytes.
The use of aminoglycoside antibiotics is limited by ototoxicity that can produce permanent hearing loss. We report that concurrent administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists markedly attenuates both the hearing loss and destruction of cochlear hair cells in guinea pigs treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics. These findings indicate that aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss is mediated, in part, through an excitotoxic process. The high correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.928; P < 0.01) obtained between the relative cochleotoxicities of a series of aminoglycosides in humans and the potencies of these compounds to produce a polyamine-like enhancement of [3H]dizocilpine binding to NMDA receptors is consistent with this hypothesis, and provides a simple in vitro assay that can predict this aspect of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.
Effects of a newly identified group of organic environmental pollutants of concern (N-heterocyclic derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, NPAHs) were investigated using the 96 h FETAX (Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay - Xenopus). Beside standard FETAX parameters (mortality, malformations), changes in several biochemical markers were studied as early signs of intoxication. Biomarkers included determination of glutathione (GSH) levels and lipid peroxidation as well as activities of important detoxification and antioxidant enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase). 1,10-Phenathroline was the most toxic of all tested compounds (96 h LC(50) = 4 microM). All tested NPAHs induced malformations in the frog embryos. The data suggest that the exposure to NPAHs can induce oxidative stress in amphibians; most biochemical markers were modulated at concentrations lower than those resulting in significant mortality. Results document mortality and teratogenicity of all studied NPAHs to amphibian embryos while no significant mortality, teratogenicity or modulations in biochemical markers could be observed with unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at concentrations up to their water solubility. This information along with the significantly greater solubility and thus bioavailability compared to their nonsubstituted parent compounds suggests that NPAHs could contribute significantly to the overall aquatic toxicity of mixtures of PAHs and their derivatives.
Treatment of rats with mirex (40 ppm in diet) caused hypoglycemia, liver enlargement, and inhibition of adrenal corticosteroid-synthesizing enzyme activity. At toxic dosages (20,000 ppm mirex in diet, which has a lethal toxicity-50 [LT-50] of ten days) poisoned female rats showed severe hypoglycemia, fatty liver, adrenal hyperplasia, hypophagia, lipid mobilization, and body weight (bw) loss. A 50 micrograms/kg intraperitoneal (IP) dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in male rats caused similar effects two days posttreatment. Hypoglycemia could be overcome by prednisone (which also inhibited adrenocorticoid-synthesizing enzyme activities) but not by streptozotocin treatment, indicating that hypoglycemia may be related to glucocorticoid deficiency resulting from inhibition of their synthesis and not by direct effects on pancreatic beta-cells. Glucocorticoid deficiency could also cause increased release of adrenocorticoid hormone (ACTH), which may enhance fat mobilization caused by hypophagia.
The objectives of this study were to investigate the dysplasia, histological malformations, and genetic abnormalities in male rats induced by maternal exposure to di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP). Here we report novel findings concerning developmental abnormalities resulting from prenatal exposure to DBP, which leads to significant anorectal malformations (ARMs) in male rat offspring. The incidence of ARMs was 39.5% in male offspring and all abnormal pups were complicated with secondary megacolon. General images, histological analysis and anatomy examination confirmed the malformation. The development abnormalities such as decreased bodyweight (BW) and anogenital distance (AGD), shortened body lengths (with tail removed), as well as increased abdominal circumference were observed at different developmental stages of ARMs in male rat. The developmental abnormalities in both solid organs (brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) and reproductive organs (testes and epididymis) of abnormal pubs on PND35 were also investigated. In addition, the serum testosterone (T) level of ARMs in male rats on PND1 was significantly lower than that of controls with accompanying reduced expression of androgen receptor (AR), sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) mRNA from tissues of the terminal rectum. These results conclusively demonstrate for the first time that in utero exposure to DBP leads to an increased likelihood for the development of ARMs and subsequent complicating megacolon in male rat offspring.
Estrogens have profound effects on the maintenance of bone mass. Urist's early studies showed species differences in reactions of bone to estrogens and in their ability to inhibit endosteal resorption and to reduce the number of osteoclasts. It is now clear that estrogens are anticatabolic as quantified by kinetic and radiographic studies. The clinical use of this important action of estrogens for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis has recently been accepted by the NIH Consensus on Treatment of Osteoporosis and by the Food and Drug Administration. The relation of hip fractures to osteoporosis and vertebral compressions, shown by Urist et al. in 1959, is now clarified by direct noninvasive measurement of vertebral spongiosa, which is preferentially involved. Prevention of bone loss and fractures by estrogen has now been established morphometrically and epidemiologically; dose-response curves are available for four preparations. Urist showed in 1948 that estrogens are ineffective in vitro; it is now known that bone lacks estrogen receptors. Their antiosteolytic action appears to be mediated by calcitonin. As a consequence of all these studies, the serious human and public health problem of postmenopausal osteoporosis, with fractures of the vertebrae, wrists, and hips, deformity, and death, is one of the few geriatric disorders for which effective and safe prophylaxis is now practical.
This pilot study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a new intensive drug regimen, combined with involved-nodal-field radiotherapy, in advanced Hodgkin's disease not treated by chemotherapy.
From September 1990 to March 1993, 73 evaluable patients with newly diagnosed stage IIB, III (A and B), and IV (A and B) Hodgkin's disease or who were relapsing after primary subtotal or total nodal irradiation were treated with eight cycles of etoposide, epirubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEBEP) followed by radiotherapy (30-36 Gy) to the nodal site or sites of pretreatment disease. The median duration of follow-up was 68 months.
The complete remission rate was 94% (95% CI: 86-98). At 6 years, freedom from progression and overall survival rates were 78% (95% CI: 68-88) and 82% (95% CI: 73-91), respectively. There was one episode of fatal sepsis after bone marrow aplasia that occurred after VEBEP and extended-field irradiation. Hematologic toxicity during chemotherapy was acceptable; without the support of growth factors, grade IV leukopenia and grade IV neutropenia, as determined within cycles, occurred in 38% and 85% of patients, respectively, but was reversible in the vast majority of patients by the day of treatment recycle. No episodes of epidoxorubicin-related cardiomyopathy or symptomatic pulmonary toxicity were documented. Overt and/or subclinical hypothyroidism occurred in 38% of cases. Gonadal damage was evident in the large majority of male patients but reversible in half of them, whereas permanent sterility was observed in females at least 35 years of age. No secondary leukemia has been so far detected.
VEBEP followed by involved-nodal-field radiotherapy is an effective treatment for chemotherapy-naive Hodgkin's disease and is associated to acceptable rates of acute and intermediate-term toxicity. This intensive regimen, which does not routinely require the support of hematopoietic growth factors and can be delivered in an outpatient setting, warrants a prospective comparison in a randomized trial versus one of the more effective standard-combination regimens.
We report the first case of recurrent ifosfamide-related neurotoxicity in the same patient following two distinct administrations of the drug at different doses and schedules and with a long interval between the two episodes. Remarkably, the first event was characterized by confusion and hallucinations, while the second, 29 months later, was characterized by partial and generalized seizures. Between the two episodes the patient had received high-dose cyclophosphamide, an oxazophoshorine agent closely related to ifosfamide, without any neurological side effects. We briefly discuss the diagnosis and management of ifosfamide-related encephalopathy.
A structurally original series of N-(1-ethyl-4-methylhexahydro-1,4-diazepin-6-yl)pyridine-3-carboxamides derived from the corresponding benzamide 5 were prepared and evaluated for their binding affinity for the dopamine D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(3) receptors using rat striatum and rat cortical membrane, respectively. Many of the synthesized pyridine-3-carboxamides exhibited nanomolar binding affinity for the serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor along with moderate to high binding affinity for the dopamine D(2) receptor. Introduction of the more lipophilic bromine atom and methylamino group at the 5- and 6-positions of the pyridine ring, respectively, enhanced the affinity for the dopamine D(2) receptor while keeping a potent serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor binding affinity. As a result of structure-affinity relationships, the 5-bromo-2-methoxy-6-methylaminopyridine-3-carboxamide 53 was selected as the most promising product showing a high binding affinity for both receptors. Compound 53 affinity for the dopamine D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(3) receptors was much more potent than that of metoclopramide (dopamine D(2) receptor; 23.3 nM vs 444 nM, serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor; 0.97 nM vs 228 nM). Optical resolution of the racemate 53 brought about a dramatic change in the pharmacological profile with (R)-53 exhibiting a strong affinity for both the dopamine D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(3) receptors, while the corresponding (S)-53 had a potent serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor binding affinity and a moderate dopamine D(2) receptor binding affinity. X-ray crystallographic study of (R)-53 revealed the existence of two energically stable conformers just like two mirror images. This may account for (R)-53 high affinity for both the dopamine D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(3) receptors. Pharmacologically, (R)-53 [AS-8112] showed a potent antagonistic activity for both the dopamine D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(3) receptors in vivo tests and dose-dependently inhibited both the incidence and frequency of emetic episodes induced by cisplatin (ferrets) and morphine (dogs) with ID(50) values of 27.1 microg/kg, po and 136 microg/kg, po, respectively. On the basis of this pharmacological profile, (R)-53 is now under further investigation as a potential broad antiemetic agent.
The acute effects of an intravenous infusion of bepridil (BEP) (4 mg . kg-1) on left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics, coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF), and myocardial metabolism were studied in eight patients with coronary artery disease. In contrast with data previously reported with calcium channel blockers, BEP induced an elevation in LV end-diastolic pressure from 12.0 +/- 7.1 to 20.1 +/- 7.2 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.001) and a fall in LV dp/dt max from 1339 +/- 302 to 1177 +/- 251 mm Hg . sec-1 (p less than 0.01). This significant alteration in LV function is likely to be explained by the lack of effect on heart rate and aortic pressure observed after an acute intravenous infusion of BEP. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) increased from 448 +/- 272 to 498 +/- 273 mumol . min-1/100 g LV (p less than 0.05) as did CSBF from 79.5 +/- 42.7 to 92.1 +/- 45.1 ml X min-1/100 g LV (p less than 0.01). Lactate extraction fell from 0.33 +/- 0.17 to 0.15 +/- 0.17 (p less than 0.05). A contrast medium-induced coronary reactive hyperemia (HPR) evidenced an increased hyperemic volume from 9.5 +/- 3.6 to 12.1 +/- 4.5 ml/100 g LV (p less than 0.01) and HPR duration from 23.3 +/- 6.9 to 32.3 +/- 15.4 sec (p less than 0.05) after BEP. However, the peak/resting CSBF ratio was blunted after BEP from 1.74 +/- 0.18 to 1.61 +/- 0.12 (p less than 0.05), evidencing a net effect of BEP on HPR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Halothane hepatitis is extremely rare in childhood. However, this occurred in an 11-month-old infant, following multiple exposure to halothane. The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of specific antibodies to halothane-sensitised rabbit hepatocytes. The anaesthetic technique for a subsequent procedure with a halothane-free breathing system is also outlined.
Three-hundred-and-fifteen patients, aged 60 or more years, affected by degenerative joint disease (DJD) in the active stage, the majority with concomitant pathological conditions of various organs and systems and undergoing various combined drug treatments, were treated with 300 mg b.i.d. etodolac in order to assay its efficacy and safety profile in an aged population more exposed to the occurrence of adverse events. In a subset of these patients, the impact of etodolac treatment on cognitive function and mood was studied. All clinical assessments revealed highly significant improvement after etodolac treatment. Significant improvement was found also for what concerns mood, whereas only the less aged patients showed improvement in cognitive abilities after treatment with etodolac. Only 30 patients (9.5%) showed side-effects, resulting in suspension of treatment in 10 cases (3.17%). In all cases, adverse reactions subsided with no consequences. Laboratory tests performed at the end of the study yielded mean values comprised within the normal range and were not statistically different from the same examinations performed before starting treatment. Occult blood in stool turned positive after treatment with etodolac only in six patients (2%). In conclusion, etodolac proved to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of risk-aged patients with active DJD.
Data from the Swedish Adverse Reactions Advisory Committee suggest that use of clozapine is associated with venous thromboembolic complications. We summarise 12 cases of thromboembolism during clozapine treatment. In five cases the outcome was fatal.
Multiple studies now demonstrate that autism is medically characterized, in part, by immune system dysregulation, including evidence of neuroglial activation and gastrointestinal inflammation. This neuroglial process has further been characterized as neuroinflammation. In addition, a subset of autistic children exhibit higher than average levels of androgens. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and potassium-sparing diuretic with a desirable safety profile. It possesses potent anti-inflammatory and immune modifying properties that might make it an excellent medical intervention for autism spectrum disorders. Furthermore, spironolactone demonstrates substantial anti-androgen properties that might further enhance its appeal in autism, particularly in a definable subset of hyperandrogenic autistic children. One case report is briefly reviewed demonstrating objective clinical improvements in an autistic child after spironolactone administration. Additional research in controlled trials is now needed to further define the risks and benefits of spironolactone use in children with autism.
Evaluation of the characteristics of individuals presenting for substance abuse treatment can provide important information to help focus treatment services. In this study, demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals presenting for medication trials for the treatment of cocaine or marijuana dependence were compared. Marijuana-dependent subjects were generally younger than cocaine-dependent subjects, more likely to be Caucasian, and completed more years of education. Marijuana-dependent subjects also reported significantly more days using than cocaine-dependent subjects, as well as higher levels of craving. Some differences in psychiatric symptomatology were also noted, with cocaine-dependent subjects more likely to report anxiety symptoms and marijuana-dependent subjects reporting more past depressive episodes. Past and current other drug use was similar between the two groups. These results highlight the significant impairments associated with marijuana and cocaine dependence.
This study was designed to investigate the possibility of β-cyfluthrin to induce oxidative stress and biochemical perturbations in rat liver and the role of selenium in alleviating its toxic effects. Male Wister rats were randomly divided into four groups of seven each, group I served as control, group II treated with selenium (200 µg/kg BW), group III received β-cyfluthrin (15 mg/kg BW, 1/25 LD50 ), and group IV treated with β-cyfluthrin plus selenium. Rats were orally administered their respective doses daily for 30 days. The administration of β-cyfluthrin caused elevation in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reduction in the activities of antioxidant enzymes including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR). A decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) content was also observed. Liver aminotransferases (AST and ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were decreased, whereas lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was increased. Selenium in β-cyfluthrin-induced liver oxidative injury of the rats modulated LPO, CAT, SOD, GSH, GST, GPx, and GR. Also, liver AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH were maintained near normal level due to selenium treatment. It is concluded that selenium scavenges reactive oxygen species and render a protective effect against β-cyfluthrin toxicity.
Azaspiracids (AZAs) are a novel group of marine phycotoxins that have been associated with severe human intoxication. We found that AZA-1 exposure increased lactate dehydrogense (LDH) efflux in murine neocortical neurons. AZA-1 also produced nuclear condensation and stimulated caspase-3 activity with an half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) value of 25.8 nM. These data indicate that AZA-1 triggers neuronal death in neocortical neurons by both necrotic and apoptotic mechanisms. An evaluation of the structure-activity relationships of AZA analogs on LDH efflux and caspase-3 activation demonstrated that the full structure of AZAs was required to produce necrotic or apoptotic cell death. The similar potencies of AZA-1 to stimulate LDH efflux and caspase-3 activation and the parallel structure-activity relationships of azaspiracid analogs in the two assays are consistent with a common molecular target for both responses. To explore the molecular mechanism for AZA-1-induced neurotoxicity, we assessed the influence of AZA-1 on Ca(2+) homeostasis. AZA-1 suppressed spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations (EC(50) = 445 nM) in neocortical neurons. A distinct structure-activity profile was found for inhibition of Ca(2+) oscillations where both the full structure as well as analogs containing only the FGHI domain attached to a phenyl glycine methyl ester moiety were potent inhibitors. The molecular targets for inhibition of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations and neurotoxicity may therefore differ. The caspase protease inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK produced a complete elimination of AZA-1-induced LDH efflux and nuclear condensation in neocortical neurons. Although the molecular target for AZA-induced neurotoxicity remains to be established, these results demonstrate that the observed neurotoxicity is dependent on a caspase signaling pathway.
