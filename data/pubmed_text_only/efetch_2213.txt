Crude extracts of the red-orange, bracket fungus Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, collected from five distinct Australian localities were subjected to a chemical and biological profiling study. Subsequent detailed investigation of two of these specimens resulted in the isolation of the new phenoxazone alkaloid, pycnoporin (8), together with cinnabarin (1), tramesanguin (2), and cinnabarinic acid (3). Ergosterol peroxide (11) was also identified from one of the specimens studied. Compounds 1-3 and 8 were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analyzes, which included the application of elevated temperature-controlled NMR experiments. In addition to the isolation and characterization of 8, this study describes the first successful HPLC purification strategy and complete 2D NMR spectroscopic characterization of compounds 1-3. Also reported are the antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities of the crude extracts of one of the P. cinnabarinus specimens. Compounds 1-3, 8 and 11 displayed varying degrees of antitumor activity while ergosterol peroxide (11) also showed slight antimicrobial and antiviral activities. This is the first report documenting the significant antitumor activity of cinnabarin (1).
An ethanol extract of turmeric was studied in rats for its ability to inhibit gastric secretion and to protect gastroduodenal mucosa against the injuries caused by pyloric ligation, hypothermic-restraint stress, indomethacin, reserpine and cysteamine administration and cystodestructive agents including 80% ethanol, 0.6 M HCl, 0.2 M NaOH and 25% NaCl. An oral dose of 500 mg/kg of the extract produced significant anti-ulcerogenic activity in rats subjected to hypothermic-restraint stress, pyloruic ligation and indomethacin and reserpine administration. The extract had a highly significant protective effect against cystodestructive agents. The reduction in the intensity of ulceration of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers was not found to be statistically significant. Turmeric extract not only increased the gastric wall mucus significantly but also restored the non-protein sulfhydryl (NP-SH) content in the glandular stomachs of the rats.
A description of the clinical and biochemical course is given for a patient who developed haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia following dapsone therapy in high dosage for 2 weeks.
We report the clinicopathological features of 203 cases of pathologically proven multiple system atrophy (MSA) from 108 publications up to February 1995. The majority of patients showed symptoms in their early fifties, and men were more commonly affected than women (ratio of 1.3:1). Most patients suffered from some degree of autonomic failure (74%). Parkinsonism was the most common motor disorder (87%), followed by cerebellar ataxia (54%) and pyramidal signs (49%). The response to levodopa was poor in most patients, but there was a subgroup with a good response, who also often developed axial levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Other characteristic features included severe dysarthria, stridor, and, in a few patients, contractures and dystonia (antecollis). Mild or moderate intellectual impairment occurred in some cases, but severe dementing illness was most unusual. The main pathological change comprised cell loss and gliosis in the putamen, caudate nucleus, external pallidum, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, inferior olives, pontine nuclei, cerebellar Purkinje cells, and intermediolateral cell columns of the spinal cord. However, other neuronal populations were also involved to varying degrees, such as the thalamus, vestibular nucleus, dorsal vagal nucleus, corticospinal tracts, and anterior horn cells. Characteristic glial and/or neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were identified in all cases in which they were sought, irrespective of clinical presentation. Akinesia correlated with the degree of nigral and putaminal cell loss, whereas rigidity was related only to the later. Tremor was unrelated to cell loss at any site. Ataxia correlated with the degree of olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Pyramidal signs were associated with pyramidal tract pallor. Our analysis also confirmed an association of postural hypotension with intermediolateral cell column degeneration.
m-Hydroxybenzoylecgonine (m-OH-BE) and d3-m- hydroxybenzoylecgonine (d3-m-OH-BE) have been synthesized, and a GC/MS procedure with d3-m-OH-BE as internal standard has been developed. Among 24 human urine specimens that were positive for BE, all of them have shown detectable levels of m-OH-BE with 75% of the specimens exceeding the LoQ (5 ng/mL), compared with only 50% of the specimens containing detectable levels of EME. The presence of m-OH-BE in urine suggested that this metabolite may serve as a valuable marker of cocaine use in addition to BE and EME.
Systemic sclerosis-like lesions developed in a 14-year-old boy with Wilson's disease who had been treated with D-penicillamine for 11 years. Clinical and laboratory manifestations included proximal scleroderma, pulmonary restrictive defects, positive antinuclear antibodies, and the deposition of C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction of the lesional skin. This is the first case reported in which long-term administration of penicillamine was followed by the development of systemic sclerosis-like lesions.
Fluoxetine, a highly specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been reported to cause sexual dysfunction in a minority of patients. Although priapism has been associated with other serotonergic antidepressants, no published reports have correlated restoration of sexual potency with use of fluoxetine.
The case histories of three geriatric patients treated with fluoxetine for depression or obsessive compulsive disorder are presented.
Three patients with histories of impotence experienced a return of sexual potency after treatment with fluoxetine. In two of the cases, the patients had documented histories of vascular disease, which their internists had identified as the cause of their impotence. The improvement in sexual response was seemingly unrelated to abatement of depression or obsessive compulsive disorder, and there was no description of priapism by any of the patients.
Sexual side effects of fluoxetine may be more variable than previously thought. Animal models showing paradoxical or opposing responses to serotonin-enhancing agents may apply to human sexual functioning as well.
This study examined the ability to inhibit and execute behavioral responses in adult cocaine users and in an aged-matched sample with no history of cocaine use. Subjects (n=22) were identified as cocaine users by testing positive for the presence of cocaine or benzoylecgonine in urine-analysis and by self-reported cocaine use. Control subjects (n=22) tested negative in urine-analysis and reported no past cocaine use. Response inhibition and response execution were measured by a stop-signal paradigm using a choice reaction time task that engaged subjects in responding to go-signals when stop-signals occasionally informed them to inhibit the response. Cocaine users displayed significantly poorer ability to inhibit their behavioral responses than did controls. Specifically, cocaine users required more time to inhibit responses to stop-signals and displayed a lower probability of inhibiting their responses. Cocaine users did not differ from controls in their ability to execute responses as measured by their speed and accuracy of responses to go-signals. These findings are important because they identify a specific deficit involving behavioral inhibition that could contribute to cocaine abuse, and explain its association with other disorders of self-regulation, such as ADHD.
Of over 300 patients with erectile dysfunction, 186 were selected for intracavernosal autoinjection therapy with a standardized papaverine-phentolamine mixture. A total of 156 patients performed 4,813 protocol autoinjections with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 230 per patient. The dose that induced a full erection at the hospital could be reduced under home conditions by a mean of 35 per cent. Systemic side effects were not observed. The most inconvenient local side effects were prolonged erections in 24 patients in diagnostic use and in 3 patients in therapeutic use. There were treated easily without further consequences.
Neuroanatomical studies have revealed extensive structural brain abnormalities in subjects with autism. Recently, studies have provided evidence of neuroglial responses and neuroinflammation in autism. The current study investigated whether two astrocytic markers, aquaporin 4 and connexin 43, are altered in brains from subjects with autism. Postmortem brain tissues from Brodmann's Area 40 (BA40, parietal cortex), Brodmann's Area 9 (BA9, superior frontal cortex), and cerebella of subjects with autism and matched controls were subject to SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Connexin 43 expression was increased significantly in BA9. Aquaporin 4 expression was decreased significantly in cerebellum. These data suggest that changes are apparent in markers for abnormal glial-neuronal communication (connexin 43 and aquaporin 4) in brains of subjects with autism.
To shed light on the role of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in renal injury, we evaluated the effects of S-1452, a TXA2 receptor antagonist, on rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic nephropathy and murine lupus nephritis. In STZ diabetes rats (n = 6), urinary protein excretion significantly increased from 8 weeks and was about 5 times as much as that in normal rats at 10 weeks after induction of diabetes. In S-1452-treated rats (n = 6), increase in urinary protein was rarely observed and was significantly inhibited at 8 and 10 weeks after induction of diabetes. In (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, no proteinuria was detected in vehicle controls (n = 20) and S-1452-treated mice (n = 20) from 0 to 8 weeks after initiation of S-1452 treatment. Proteinuria was observed in 3, 7 and 8 mice in the control group, and 0, 2 and 5 mice in the S-1452 group at 12, 16 and 20 weeks after initiation of S-1452 treatment, respectively. Proteinuria developed more slowly in S-1452-treated mice than in vehicle controls. In conclusion, TXA2 receptor antagonist, S-1452, suppresses the progression of renal injury.
We report a patient in whom cyproheptadine-induced hepatitis was followed by prolonged cholestasis marked by elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, gammaglutamyltransferase and bile acid levels, and disappearance of small bile ducts. Chlorpromazine and imipramine, which can induce a similar acute hepatitis followed by protracted cholestasis, have a close chemical structure (i.e., a tricyclic ring). We suggest that this structure might be involved in this type of hepatotoxicity.
In men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, prolonged treatment with LH and FSH induces spermatogenesis. To compare the respective role of exogenous testosterone and intratesticular testosterone on the induction and maintenance of spermatogenesis, 10 men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and without history of cryptorchidism were studied. They were treated with human gonadotropins (hMG; 150 IU FSH and LH and 1500 IU hCG, im, three times weekly) or pure FSH (150 IU, im, three times a week) and testosterone (T: 250 mg, im, once a week). Five men were treated first with hMG-hCG and then with pure FSH plus T. The other five men started with pure FSH plus T. Each treatment period lasted 24 months. In all men, hMG-hCG induced spermatogenesis after 24 months, with normal motility and quality. The combination of pure FSH and T was not able to induce spermatogenesis after 24 months. In addition, sperm count dropped dramatically to 0.3 +/- 0.1 x 10(6)/mL within 3 months and to 0 after 6 months when pure FSH and T followed [corrected] hMG-hCG. Plasma T levels were increased by both treatments, but significantly more after pure FSH and T (35.3 +/- 5.2 nmol/L) than after hMG-hCG (20.4 +/- 5.2 nmol/L; P < 0.05). Plasma estradiol levels after treatment with pure FSH and T were also increased, but the difference from those obtained during hMG-hCG treatment was not significant. In conclusion, in men with complete gonadotropin deficiency, FSH and exogenous T are not able to induce spermatogenesis. Furthermore, spermatogenesis induced by LH plus FSH (hMG-hCG) cannot be maintained when exogenous T replaced LH in the regimen. Thus, exogenous T is unable to replace LH (and intratesticular T) to induce spermatogenesis. These data are noteworthy in the prospect of male contraception after a complete blockade of gonadotropin activity.
Ticlopidine is a novel antiplatelet agent used alone or in combination with aspirin and anticoagulants in the treatment and prevention of various vascular diseases. Gastrointestinal side effects, including bleeding, have been reported with use of ticlopidine in most of the vascular prevention trials. We studied the endoscopic evidence of mucosal damage in patients taking ticlopidine compared with patients taking aspirin/nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and matched controls.
We performed a longitudinal review of gastrointestinal endoscopy, pharmacy databases, and medical records of patients referred to our service over a period of 6 months for endoscopic evaluation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, unexplained anemia, or abdominal pain. Data were collected and analyzed for 55 patients taking ticlopidine, 77 age- and gender-matched patients taking aspirin or NSAIDs, and 560 age- and gender-matched control patients not taking any of these medications.
The overall prevalence of ulcers was marginally higher in the aspirin/NSAID group than in the ticlopidine group (35% vs. 29%) and was significantly higher among patients taking aspirin, NSAIDs, or ticlopidine than among controls (15%). Gastritis was also noted more frequently in the aspirin/NSAID and ticlopidine groups than in the control group. Endoscopic evidence of esophagitis was significantly more frequent in the control group than in the aspirin/NSAID and ticlopidine groups. There was no significant difference across groups in the prevalence of ulcers, gastritis, or esophagitis.
Patients taking ticlopidine are more likely to have endoscopic evidence of mucosal damage than matched control patients and are nearly as likely to have such damage as endoscopically evaluated patients taking aspirin or NSAIDs. However, these findings must be confirmed using prospective cohort data for patients in primary care settings, to avoid referral bias.
L-DOPA was acutely or repeatedly administered to rats and common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) denervation of the dopamine inputs to the forebrain. Using in situ hybridization it was found that L-DOPA-treated animals exhibited a pronounced induction in the gene expression of both c-jun and c-fos in striatum and cerebral cortex restricted to the dopamine-depleted hemisphere. In contrast, acute treatment with cocaine induced c-fos mRNA, but not c-jun mRNA, in the striatum of normal animals. These data suggest that dopamine denervation leads to neurochemical adaptations which enables L-DOPA to induce a sustained gene expression of c-jun. Such aberrant gene regulation may underlie the development of L-DOPA-induced movement disorders which are commonly found in patients with Parkinson's disease.
A-86929 ((-)-trans-9,10-dihydroxy-2-propyl-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-3- thia-5-azacyclopent-1-ena[c]phenanthrene) is a potent and selective full agonist at the dopamine D1 receptor. Both A-86929 and ABT-431 ((-)-trans-9,10-diacetyloxy-2-propyl-4,5,5a,6,7,11b- hexahydro-3-thia-5-azacyclopent-1-ena[c]phenanthrene hydrochloride), the diacetyl prodrug derivative of A-86929, were evaluated for their effects on behavioral excitability in rodents. In rats, A-86929 produced a dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity that was attenuated by the selective dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, as well as by higher doses of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, haloperidol. Repeated administration of A-86929 over 6 days produced hyperactivity which did not change in magnitude across days. Acute administration of A-86929 and ABT-431 to mice produced behavioral seizure activity, with ED50 values of 7.1 and 2.7 mumol/kg, s.c., respectively, that was blocked by SCH 23390. Young rats (35-37 days) exhibited behavioral seizures following A-86929 and ABT-431 treatment (ED50 = 34.2 and 35.6 mumol/kg, s.c., respectively), but at doses higher than those required in mice. Moreover, adult rats (3 months) were less sensitive (ED50 = 345 mumol/kg, s.c.) to A-86929-induced seizures than young rats. Comparison of the ED50 values that produced behavioral seizure activity in rats with those previously established to produce contralateral rotation (ED50 = 0.24 mumol/kg, s.c.) in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat indicates that a significant dose separation exists between these two properties of A-86929.
A 20-year-old epileptic patient developed hypertension during CBZ treatment, without any demonstrable etiological factor. After CBZ discontinuation, a gradual normalization of blood pressure values was observed. The authors discuss the possible role of ADH in the production of this unfrequent side effect.
This study was undertaken to compare the ability of a series of compounds from different chemical classes to induce lung tumors in strain A/J mice after either ip or po administration. 3-Methylcholanthrene, benzo(a)pyrene, urethan, diethylnitrosamine, ethylnitrosourea, and dimethylhydrazine induced a significant (p less than 0.05; t test) increase in the lung tumor response when given both ip and po. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, and a 2:1 mixture of 2,4-dinitrotoluene and 2,6-dinitrotoluene were inactive by both routes of administration and at all dose levels. The lung tumor response to all doses of 3-methylcholanthrene and benzo(a)pyrene, the highest dose of diethylnitrosamine, and the middle doses of both ethylnitrosourea and dimethylhydrazine varied as a function of the route of administration. This finding was most evident for the polycyclic hydrocarbons, e.g., the average number of lung tumors per mouse in animals that received the middle dose of 3-methylcholanthrene or the highest dose of benzo(a)pyrene by the ip route exceeded that by the po route by factors of 12 and 13, respectively. Tissue distribution and elimination studies were conducted in an effort to determine the basis for the observed difference in lung tumor response to 3-methylcholanthrene after ip or po administration. The data indicated that 3-methylcholanthrene persists for longer periods in the animals when given ip, thus potentially providing an extended carcinogenic stimulus. Extrapulmonary lesions observed at a higher than normal frequency at necropsy included peritoneal sarcomas (in 3-methylcholanthrene-treated mice), and both squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach and abnormal lesions of the liver (in diethylnitrosamine-treated mice).
A patient with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis developed ascites while taking weekly doses of methotrexate (MTX). Her serum transaminase and albumin levels were normal. A liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with bridging fibrosis and piecemeal necrosis. Upon discontinuation of MTX, her ascites resolved, and her arthritis became more active. This is the third report of reversible hepatic decompensation associated with prolonged MTX therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling is central in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the key source of extracellular matrix (ECM) in fibrotic liver. We tested the therapeutic potential of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in advanced cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis was induced by bile duct-ligation (BDL) or thioacetamide injections (TAA). Rats received oral rapamycin (0.5 mg/kg/day) for either 14 or 28 days. Untreated BDL and TAA-rats served as controls. Liver function was quantified by aminopyrine breath test. ECM and ECM-producing cells were quantified by morphometry. MMP-2 activity was measured by zymography. mRNA expression of procollagen-alpha1, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and beta2 was quantified by RT-PCR.
Fourteen days of rapamycin improved liver function. Accumulation of ECM was decreased together with numbers of activated HSCs and MMP-2 activity in both animal models. TGF-beta1 mRNA was downregulated in TAA, TGF-beta2 mRNA was downregulated in BDL. 28 days of rapamycin treatment entailed a survival advantage of long-term treated BDL-rats.
Low-dose rapamycin treatment is effectively antifibrotic and attenuates disease progression in advanced fibrosis. Our results warrant the clinical evaluation of rapamycin as an antifibrotic drug.
An animal model of haloperidol-induced tardive dyskinesia was studied in relation to the dietary manipulation of tryptophan and its effect on the movement disorder. This study showed a significant negative behavioral response to the neuroleptic drug, haloperidol. Increased dietary tryptophan (1.0 vs. 0.3%) significantly reduced the frequency of drug-induced head movements. Brain serotonin levels were elevated by the drug treatment. Brain serotonin levels correlated significantly with the behavioral response. Contrary to expectation, brain dopamine levels did not correlate with the behavioral response. These findings suggest a possible serotonergic involvement in neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia and an amelioration of the disorder through tryptophan supplementation.
Several neurotransmitter systems are involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. Here, we examined the involvement of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors in striatal degeneration in the rat model of this disease generated by administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP). Several days before onset of striatal degeneration, G-protein activation by cannabinoid agonists was significantly decreased whereas density and mRNA levels of CB(1) receptors remained essentially normal. This change was transient, CB(1) receptors recovering full functionality after few days. Later, at onset of striatal degeneration, profound alterations of CB(1) receptors were detected, including marked reductions of their density, mRNA levels and coupling to G proteins. In these rats, the administration of the cannabinoid agonist Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol was neuroprotective, which indicates that the early loss of CB(1) receptor signaling could be instrumental in 3NP toxicity. In conclusion, the present study supports the hypothesis that cannabinoid receptors, possibly the CB(1) receptor subtype, may be involved in HD pathogenesis and could be an interesting therapeutic target to slow disease progression.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that becomes refractory to medication as the disease progresses. Although in the past 5 years increasing numbers of patients have undergone stereotactically guided posteroventral pallidotomy for advanced PD, the safety and efficacy of surgery remains to be documented. The goal in this study was to determine the potential operative morbidity and types of functional outcomes by using validated PD rating scales and a patient survey.
In a prospective analysis of a consecutive surgical series the authors evaluated 58 patients with advanced PD who ranged in age from 40 to 79 years (mean 67 years) and who had undergone surgery between 1994 and 1997. They used a patient survey and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to study patients during periods of medication administration ("on") and withdrawal ("off"; mean off score before surgery = 96). Temporary surgical morbidity was found in four patients (6.9%), three of whom developed transient dysarthria and one of whom exhibited transient confusion (1.7%). One patient had persistent dysarthria (1.7%). No patient developed a visual field deficit or sustained a brain hemorrhage. All patients were discharged from the hospital within 24 hours. Significant postsurgical improvements were noted in the UPDRS off-period total and motor scores, as well as in tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and contralateral dyskinesia (p < 0.005). Improvements persisted in dyskinesia and tremor for the 21 patients who were evaluated past 1 year. The authors found no improvement in any on-period symptoms except dyskinesia. Thirty-one (61 %) of 51 patients surveyed reported functional gains and/or dramatic improvement in symptoms, 17 (33%) reported symptomatic improvement without functional gains, and three (6%) had minimal or no change in symptoms. No change in the mini mental state examination score was noted during follow up. There were no significant postoperative changes in the use of medication.
In advanced PD associated with either a medically refractory state with significant off periods or levodopa-induced dyskinesias, magnetic resonance imaging-guided pallidotomy with macrostimulation was associated with minimal morbidity and yet significantly reduced dyskinesia and off-period disability. These improvements were of value to the patient and persisted beyond the 1st year.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected methamphetamine (METH) abusers show greater neuropathological abnormalities than HIV-negative METH abusers or HIV-positive non-METH users. Herein, we investigated the effects of METH and of the HIV protein, Tat, using the human neuroblastoma cell line, SHY5Y. METH and Tat alone caused no toxic effects. In contrast, the combination of METH and Tat caused significant increases in the percentage of dead cells observed after 48 h of exposure. These results suggest the possibility of using this model to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the potentiation of clinical effects observed in patient populations of HIV-positive METH-abusing patients.
