Anecdotal reports of increased libido and sexual function in patients taking trazodone have led to its empirical use in patients with erectile dysfunction. A retrospective review of patient-reported responses to trazodone was performed to outline the efficacy and side-effect profile of this agent.
Between 1989 and 1994, 182 patients were placed on oral trazodone as empirical therapy for erectile dysfunction. Patients ranged in age from 26 to 85 years, with a mean of 60 years. Patients were evaluated before receiving trazodone with a thorough medical history and physical examination. Known risk factors for erectile dysfunction were assigned based on historical information and the findings of the examination. Patients received trazodone for at least 2 consecutive months, with daily doses starting at 25 mg.
One hundred twenty-seven patients were available for follow-up by a standardized questionnaire regarding perceived improvement in erectile function, sexual function, and side effects. In patients less than 60 years of age, with no known risk factors for erectile dysfunction, 21 of 27 (78%) showed significant improvement in erectile ability. Smokers and patients older than 60 years with a history of significant peripheral vascular disease responded poorly to trazodone therapy. The duration of erectile dysfunction was inversely related to a response to trazodone. Of patients with a duration of impotence less than 12 months, 48% reported a positive response. Only 16% of patients with duration of erectile dysfunction greater than 60 months reported improvement in erections and sexual function. Trazodone was well tolerated by this population, with 62% reporting no side effects.
Despite the limitations of a nonrandomized, retrospective study, trazodone appears to benefit younger patients with erectile dysfunction with few known risk factors. A prospective, placebo-controlled trial is needed to confirm the observations of this pilot study.
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) is a clinically tolerated inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), antioxidant and antiinflammatory agent, which provides protection in brain ischemia models. In neonatal hypoxia-ischemia model, PDTC activates Akt and reduces activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta). Because chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and increased GSK-3beta activity are features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, we tested whether PDTC reduces brain pathology and improves cognitive function in a transgenic animal model of AD. A 7 month oral treatment with PDTC prevented the decline in cognition in AD mice without altering beta-amyloid burden or gliosis. Moreover, marked oxidative stress and activation of NF-kappaB were not part of the brain pathology. Instead, the phosphorylated form of GSK-3beta was decreased in the AD mouse brain, and PDTC treatment increased the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta. Also, PDTC treatment increased the copper concentration in the brain. In addition, PDTC rescued cultured hippocampal neurons from the toxicity of oligomeric Abeta and reduced tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus of AD mice. Finally, astrocytic glutamate transporter GLT-1, known to be regulated by Akt pathway, was decreased in the transgenic AD mice but upregulated back to the wild-type levels by PDTC treatment. Thus, PDTC may improve spatial learning in AD by interfering with Akt-GSK pathway both in neurons and astrocytes. Because PDTC is capable of transferring external Cu2+ into a cell, and, in turn, Cu2+ is able to activate Akt, we hypothesize that PDTC provides the beneficial effect in transgenic AD mice through Cu2+-activated Akt pathway.
To characterize the complications reported with intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA).
Literature search.
University-affiliated hospital.
A search was done in the American National Library of Medicine's PUBMED, EMBASE (1980-2007, wk 11), and Medline (from 1950) in March 2007. All complications associated with IVRA were reviewed.
The lowest dose of local anesthetic associated with a seizure was 1.4 mg/kg for lidocaine; 4 mg/kg for prilocaine, and 1.3 mg/kg for bupivacaine. Cardiac arrests and deaths were reported with lidocaine and bupivacaine only. The lowest dose associated with a cardiac arrest was 2.5 mg/kg for lidocaine and 1.6 mg/kg for bupivacaine. Local anesthetic toxicity occurring during tourniquet inflation has been reported, with tourniquet pressure exceeding initial systolic arterial blood pressure by 150 mmHg. Seizures occurring after tourniquet deflation have been reported with a tourniquet time as long as 60 minutes. Ten cases of compartment syndrome are reported.
Seizures have been reported with lidocaine at its lowest effective dose (1.5 mg/kg).
Drug-eluting stents are commonly used for percutaneous coronary intervention. Despite excellent clinical efficacy, the association between drug-eluting stents and the risk for late thrombosis remains imprecisely defined.
We performed a meta-analysis on 14 contemporary clinical trials that randomized 6675 patients to drug-eluting stents (paclitaxel or sirolimus) compared with bare metal stents. Eight of these trials have reported more than a year of clinical follow-up.
The incidence of very late thrombosis (>1 year after the index procedure) was 5.0 events per 1000 drug-eluting stent patients, with no events in bare metal stent patients (risk ratio [RR]=5.02, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29 to 19.52, P=.02). Among sirolimus trials, the incidence of very late thrombosis was 3.6 events per 1000 sirolimus stent patients, with no events in bare metal stent patients (RR=3.99, 95% CI, .45 to 35.62, P=.22). The median time of late sirolimus stent thrombosis was 15.5 months, whereas with bare metal stents it was 4 months. Among paclitaxel trials, the incidence of very late thrombosis was 5.9 events per 1000 paclitaxel stent patients, with no events in bare metal stent patients (RR=5.72, 95% CI, 1.08 to 32.45, P=.049). The median time of late paclitaxel stent thrombosis was 18 months, whereas it was 3.5 months in bare metal stent patients.
Although the incidence of very late stent thrombosis more than 1 year after coronary revascularization is low, drug-eluting stents appear to increase the risk for late thrombosis. Although more of this risk was seen with paclitaxel stents, it remains possible that sirolimus stents similarly increase the risk for late thrombosis compared with bare metal stents.
We report on a case of non-ST-segment myocardial infarction in the absence of coronary artery disease, caused by coronary embolism from the left atrial appendage. Due to the fact that the angiographically confirmed embolus did not resolve within 4 days of treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), we intravenously administered bivalirudin instead of LMWH for another 2 days and could demonstrate complete resolution of the embolus following this protocol. No bleeding complications or recurrence of myocardial ischemia occurred. Our observations may draw attention to bivalirudin therapy for coronary emboli, when LMWH is not effective.
The underlying brain injury that leads to autism has been difficult to identify. The diagnostic criteria of the disease are not readily associated with any brain region or system, nor are they mimicked by vascular accidents, tumors, or degenerative neurological diseases occurring in adults. Fortuitously, a recent report of autism induced by thalidomide exposure provides evidence that the disease originates by an injury at the time of closure of the neural tube. The human data suggest that the initiating lesion includes the motor cranial nerve nuclei. To test this hypothesis, we first examined motor nuclei in the brainstem of a human autistic case. The autopsy brain exhibited near-complete absence of the facial nucleus and superior olive along with shortening of the brainstem between the trapezoid body and the inferior olive. A similar deficit has been reported in Hoxa-1 gene knockout mice in which pattern formation of the hindbrain is disrupted during neurulation. Alternatively, exposure to antimitotic agents just after neural tube closure could produce the observed pattern of deficits. Thus, the lesions observed in the autopsy case appear to match those predicted by the thalidomide cases in both time of origin and central nervous system (CNS) location. To produce similar brain lesions experimentally, we exposed rat embryos to valproic acid, a second teratogen newly linked to autism. Dams received 350 mg/kg of valproic acid (VPA) on day 11.5 (the day of neural tube closure), day 12, or day 12.5 gestation. Each treatment significantly reduced the number of motor neurons counted in matched sections of the earliest-forming motor nuclei (V, XII), and progressively later exposures affected the VIth and IIIrd cranial nerve nuclei. All treatments spared the facial nucleus, which forms still later. Counts from the mesencephalic nucleus of trigeminal, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the locus ceruleus were not affected by exposure to VPA, even though these nuclei form during the period when exposure occurred. Despite its effects on the motor nuclei, valproic acid exposure did not alter the further development of the brain in any obvious way. Treated animals were robust and had no external malformations. The autopsy data and experimental data from rats confirm that CNS injuries occurring during or just after neural tube closure can lead to a selective loss of neurons derived from the basal plate of the rhombencephalon. The results add two new lines of evidence that place the initiating injury for autism around the time of neural tube closure.
Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine alterations in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in bladder pathways following acute and chronic irritation of the urinary tract of the rat. Chemical cystitis was induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP) which is metabolized to acrolein, an irritant eliminated in the urine. Injection of CYP (n = 10, 75 mg/kg, i.p.) 2 hours prior to perfusion (acute treatment) of the animals increased Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) in neurons in the dorsal commissure, dorsal horn, and autonomic regions of spinal segments (L1-L2 and L6-S1) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder, urethra, and ureter. Fos-IR in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic CYP treatment (n = 15, 75 mg/kg, i.p., every 3rd day for 2 weeks). In control animals and in animals treated acutely with CYP, only small numbers of NOS-IR cells (0.5-0.7 cell profiles/sections) were detected in the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Chronic CYP administration significantly (P < or = .002) increased bladder weight by 60% and increased (7- to 11-fold) the numbers of NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons in the L6-S1 DRG. A small increase (1.5-fold) also occurred in the L1 DRG, but no change was detected in the L2 and L5 DRG. Bladder afferent cells in the L6-S1 DRG labeled by Fluorogold (40 microliters) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit NOS-IR in control animals; however, following chronic CYP administration, a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were NOS-IR: L6 (19.8 +/- 4.6%) and S1 (25.3 +/- 2.9%). These results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and/or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons.
This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term lithium treatment on the kidney. Creatinine clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term lithium for more than one year. These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium, available for most of our patients. No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treatment. Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-lithium values. Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients. The concentration defect appeared reversible, at least in part. Polyuria above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients. An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings.
The effects of digoxin on monovalent cation active transport were determined in cardiac tissue obtained from dogs given inotropic, toxic, or lethal doses of digoxin. In hemodynamically monitored dogs, active uptake of the K+ analogue Rb+ was determined in vitro in a control myocardial biopsy, and then in serial biopsies from the same dog after the infusion of [3H]digoxin in doses sufficient to cause a sustained positive inotropic effect in the absence of toxicity, and finally after additional doses to induce overt toxicity. Nontoxic digoxin doses producing a mean increase of 20% in left ventricular (LV) dP/dt significantly reduced Rb+ active transport by 25% below control values. At the onset of digoxin-induced arrhythmias, maximal LV dP/dt was 53% above control whereas active Rb+ transport was reduced by 60% below baseline values (P less than 0.001). Control dogs given vehicle alone showed no significant change in contractility or in monovalent cation active transport. In another group of dogs given a lethal dose of digoxin, Rb+ active transport was reduced 59% below control levels at the onset of overt toxicity and was further reduced 80% below control at the time of onset of a fatal rhythm disturbance. When dogs were given high affinity digoxin-specific IgG or Fab fragments at the onset of overt toxicity, toxicity was rapidly reversed, and monovalent cation active transport increased to 51% of control at the time of restoration of sinus rhythm. Twenty-four hours after antibody reversal of arrhythmias, monovalent cation transport values approximated normal control levels. These data provide quantitative estimates of the extent of inhibition of monovalent cation transport by digoxin at inotropic, toxic, and lethal endpoints. Similar degrees of transport inhibition were present at the time of onset of digoxin-induced arrhythmias and at the time or arrhythmia reversal by digoxin-specific antibodies.
Amiodarone is considered to be safe in patients with prior QT prolongation and torsades de pointes taking class I antiarrhythmic agents who require continued antiarrhythmic drug therapy. However, the safety of amiodarone in advanced heart failure patients with a history of drug-induced torsades de pointes, who may be more susceptible to proarrhythmia, is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess amiodarone safety and efficacy in heart failure patients with prior antiarrhythmic drug-induced torsades de pointes. We determined the history of torsades de pointes in 205 patients with heart failure treated with amiodarone, and compared the risk of sudden death in patients with and without such a history. To evaluate the possibility that all patients with a history of torsades de pointes would be at high risk for sudden death regardless of amiodarone treatment, we compared this risk in patients with a history of torsades de pointes who were and were not subsequently treated with amiodarone. Of 205 patients with advanced heart failure, 8 (4%) treated with amiodarone had prior drug-induced torsades de pointes. Despite similar severity of heart failure, the 1-year actuarial sudden death risk was markedly increased in amiodarone patients with than without prior torsades de pointes (55% vs 15%, p = 0.0001). Similarly, the incidence of 1-year sudden death was markedly increased in patients with prior torsades de pointes taking amiodarone compared with such patients who were not subsequently treated with amiodarone (55% vs 0%, p = 0.09).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
FLT3 is mutated in roughly 30% of human AML. We used our model of APL with activated FLT3 to assess the effectiveness of chemotherapy in combination with SU11657, an inhibitor of FLT3. We found that median survival of untreated and doxorubicin-treated mice was not significantly different. While SU11657 alone increased median of survival to 55 days (P=0.01), dual therapy increased median survival to 62 days (P=0.003) when compared to controls. Neither agent alone or in combination increased survival of control mice. These results suggest that the use of targeted therapeutics can overcome resistance to traditional chemotherapies in AML.
We randomized 61 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) ( < 48 hours from onset) to either sotalol or quinidine treatment. Conversion of rhythm was recorded by Holter monitoring. The starting 80 mg dose of sotalol was repeated at 2, 6, and 10 hours if AF persisted (heart rate > 80 beats/min), and if systolic blood was > or = 120 mm Hg. In the quinidine group, if heart rate > 100 beats/min, it was decreased with intravenous digoxin, whereafter 200 mg of oral quinidine sulfate was given maximally 3 times, each dose 2 hours apart. Conversion of AF to sinus rhythm occurred in 17 or 33 patients (52%) taking sotalol, and in 24 of 28 patients (86%) taking quinidine (p < 0.0001). Electric cardioversion was necessary in 39% of the former and in 14% of the latter group. The mean delay from first trial drug to sinus rhythm with the trial medication was 10.2 +/- 7.6 hours in the sotalol group and 4.0 +/- 2.9 hours in the quinidine group (p < 0.01). Treatment was discontinued in 16 patients taking sotalol (48%) because of asymptomatic bradycardia or hypotension, and in 20 taking quinidine (71%) because of rhythm conversion. Asymptomatic wide complex tachycardia (QRS > 0.12 second) was found in 13% and 27% of patients taking sotalol and quinidine, respectively. The longest RR intervals were 6.4 and 3.8 seconds in the sotalol and quinidine groups, respectively. Oral sotalol did not appear as effective as quinidine sulfate treatment in conversion of paroxysmal AF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Twenty-one days of magnesium sulfate tocolysis were performed on a 28-year-old woman because of preterm labor at 31 weeks gestation. In association with this tocolysis, urinary calculus of magnesium ammonium phosphate occurred at 34 weeks gestation.
Th1 lymphocytes are predominant in atherosclerotic lesions. However, mechanisms involved in the Th1 predominance are unknown. We have investigated the possibility of Th1 lymphocyte recruitment in a cholesterol-rich milieu. A high cholesterol diet resulted in enhanced expression of CCR5 ligands, including CCL3 and CCL4, but not of proatherogenic CXCR3 ligands, in atherosclerotic arteries of ApoE(-/-) mice. 27-Hydroxycholesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol, cholesterol oxides (oxysterols) detected in abundance in atherosclerotic lesions, greatly induced the transcription of CCL3 and CCL4 genes in addition to enhancing secretion of corresponding proteins by THP-1 monocytic cells. However, an identical or even higher concentration of cholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholsterol did not influence expression of these chemokines. Conditioned media containing the CCR5 ligands secreted from THP-1 cells induced migration of Jurkat T cells expressing CCR5, a characteristic chemokine receptor of Th1 cells, but not of Jurkat T cells that do not express CCR5. The migration of CCR5-expressing Jurkat T cells was abrogated in the presence of a CCR5-neutralizing antibody. 27-Hydroxycholesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Pharmacological inhibitors of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathways blocked transcription as well as secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 in conjunction with attenuated migration of CCR5-expressing Jurkat T cells. This is the first report on the involvement of cholesterol oxides in migration of distinct subtype of T cells. We propose that 27-hydroxycholesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol can trigger a sequence of events that leads to recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathways play a major role in the process.
Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) improves the prognosis of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but ATRA syndrome may occur as a possible fatal side effect, especially in cases refractory to medication or involving pulmonary hemorrhage. We describe two patients with APL who suffered from intracranial hemorrhage. The first patient was a 16-yr-old girl who was treated with ATRA and then developed respiratory distress refractory to treatment with dexamethasone combined with anthracycline-cytarabine cytoreduction therapy. Treatment with Sivelestat, a small molecule inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, achieved rapid improvement in oxygenation and chest radiograph findings, and the patient has been in complete remission for 24 months. The second patient was a 10-yr-old boy in whom pulmonary hemorrhage developed following administration of ATRA, dexamethasone and cytoreduction therapy. Aspiration and administration of Sivelestat improved oxygenation and he remained stable. Hematological improvement was also achieved, but the patient died of brain dysfunction because of cerebral edema accompanied by intracranial bleeding. The two cases suggest that Sivelestat may be effective as an additional agent in the treatment of refractory ATRA syndrome, and, therefore, prospective randomized studies of treatment protocols are warranted.
The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in pregnancy remains largely unknown. Pregnant mice were subcutaneously administered tunicamycin (Tun), an ER stressor, as a single dose [0, 50, and 100 μg Tun/kg/body weight (BW)] on gestation days (GDs) 8.5, 12.5, and 15.5. A high incidence (75%) of preterm delivery was observed only in the group treated with Tun 100 μg/kg BW at GD 15.5, indicating that pregnant mice during late gestation are more susceptible to ER stress on preterm delivery. We further examined whether prolonged in utero exposure to ER stress affects fetal development. Pregnant mice were subcutaneously administered a dose of 0, 20, 40, and 60 μg Tun/kg from GD 12.5 to 16.5. Tun treatment decreased the placental and fetal weights in a dose-dependent manner. Histological evaluation showed the formation of a cluster of spongiotrophoblast cells in the labyrinth zone of the placenta of Tun-treated mice. The glycogen content of the fetal liver and placenta from Tun-treated mice was lower than that from control mice. Tun treatment decreased mRNA expression of Slc2a1/glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which is a major transporter for glucose, but increased placental mRNA levels of Slc2a3/GLUT3. Moreover, maternal exposure to Tun resulted in a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), VEGFR-2, and placental growth factor. These results suggest that excessive and exogenous ER stress may induce functional abnormalities in the placenta, at least in part, with altered GLUT and vascular-related gene expression, resulting in low infant birth weight.
The diuretic and natriuretic responses to structurally distinct classes of Ca2+ channel blockers have been compared, to determine whether any agent provoked K+-sparing natriuresis, and to assess the relation of such responses with drug effects on blood pressure. Conscious normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats received vehicle or one of the following drugs in an oral saline load (40 mL kg-1) nifedipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine, prenylamine, cinnarizine, flunarizine, diltiazem, verapamil, hydrochlorothiazide, amiloride, or hydralazine, at doses from 0.316 to 100 mg kg-1. Urine was collected for 6h. Blood pressure was monitored directly in parallel studies. Diltiazem (31.6, 100 mg kg-1) and flunarizine (100 mg.kg-1) enhanced urine and electrolyte excretion in spite of marked hypotension; diltiazem was the only drug to produce dose-related renal responses. In contrast, equihypotensive doses of hydralazine and nifedipine produced overt urine and electrolyte retention. Nitrendipine and prenylamine (0.316 mg kg-1 each) produced slight diuresis or natriuresis without altering blood pressure; higher doses had no effect. The 31.6 mg kg-1 doses of verapamil, nitrendipine, and nimodipine markedly reduced blood pressure, but neither enhanced nor limited urine and electrolyte excretion. Cinnarizine failed to produce any cardiovascular or renal effects. Diuretic responses evoked by the Ca2+ channel blockers were not class-specific, showed no tendency towards sparing K+, were generally weaker than those produced by low doses of amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide, and were dissociable from drug-induced changes in blood pressure.
We describe four cases of anaphylaxis to paracetamol without co-existing aspirin intolerance and review the Australian experience in paracetamol anaphylaxis. Paracetamol sensitivity may differ in the mechanism from sensitivity to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as previously believed.
In this paper, we attempted to construct an animal (mouse) model for monitoring the oto-neurotoxicity of mercuric sulfide, comparing its toxicity with the well-known (organic) mercury compound methyl-mercury. Mice were treated with either mercuric sulfide (HgS, 0.1 and 1.0 g/kg per day) or methyl-mercury (MeHg, 0.2, 2.0 and 10 mg/kg per day) by gastric gavage for 7 consecutive days. Analysis of auditory brainstem response (ABR) indicated that significant elevation of the physiological hearing threshold as well as significant prolongation of interwave latency I-V was observed for MeHg -- (2.0 and 0.2 mg/kg per day) or HgS -- (1.0 g/kg per day, but not 0.1 g/kg per day) treated mice. Further, both MeHg- and HgS-treated animals demonstrated a significant prolongation of interwave latency I-V that increased with an increasing mean blood-Hg level. The oto-neurotoxicity of MeHg (2.0 mg/kg per day) persisted to at least 11 weeks subsequent to the cessation of its administration. The toxic effect of HgS, however, disappeared completely 5 weeks subsequent to the cessation of its administration. These results suggest a correlation between the Hg-elicited hearing dysfunction and the availability of mercury in brain tissue. Both inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and overproduction of nitric oxide in the brainstem are consistent with an analysis of the physiological hearing threshold and latencies of ABR waveform at all time points throughout the experimental process. Thus, it is proposed that high-dose HgS or MeHg intoxication is associated with a decrease in functional Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in the brainstem of affected animals, this presumably arising via excessive nitric oxide production, and suggesting that brainstem damage may play a role in mercury-induced hearing loss.
Elevated mineralocorticoid levels and female sex hormones have been shown to confer opposing effects on renal injury, but their combined effects are still unknown.
Identify the function of estrogens and of different synthetic progestins on aldosterone salt-mediated renal disease.
The role of 17beta-estradiol, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), and drospirenone during renal injury was studied in Wistar rats subjected to uni-nephrectomy plus aldosterone salt treatment.
Aldo-salt treatment of intact, ovariectomized, and estradiol-treated female rats resulted in remnant kidney hypertrophy without structural damage. Co-treatment with MPA, but not with drospirenone, increased kidney hypertrophy, fluid turnover, sodium retention, and potassium excretion. Medroxyprogesterone acetate also caused glomerular, vascular, tubular, and interstitial lesions that were accompanied by increased blood pressure and enhanced NADPH oxidase (p67phox) and sodium channel (alpha-ENaC) expression. Drospirenone, a progestin with anti-mineralocorticoid function, and spironolactone prevented kidney hypertrophy, hypertension, and sodium retention. Drospirenone and spironolactone also increased renal angiotensin II type 2 receptor expression and relieved aldosterone-induced suppression of serum angiotensin II levels.
The choice of specific synthetic progestins has profound implications on the development of kidney injury and renal gene expression under conditions of elevated aldosterone serum levels and salt intake.
Colorectal cancer, responsible for 50,000 deaths per year, is a contributing factor for considerable mortalities in the United States. Consumption of well-done red meat and saturated fats rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be one of the causative factors for sporadic colon cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the formation of colon tumors in adult Apc(Min) mice was influenced by the ingestion of different types of fat containing benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P], a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound. Treatment consisted of 50 and 100 microg B(a)P/kg body weight dissolved in peanut or coconut oil (representatives of unsaturated and saturated fats, respectively) administered daily to six-week-old male Apc(Min) mice via oral gavage for sixty days. At the end of exposure, mice were sacrificed; jejunum and colons were retrieved and preserved in 10% formalin for observation for gross pathological changes. An increased prevalence of adenomas in colons of mice that ingested B(a)P through saturated dietary fat compared to unsaturated fat and controls (p < .05) was noticed. Interestingly, we also observed adenomas with high-grade dysplasia in the B(a)P + saturated fat group, and these incidences were frequent at the 100 microg/kg B(a)P dose. On the other hand, the B(a)P-alone and unsaturated-fat groups did not show significant differences in the numbers of adenomas and invasive tumors in the both jejunum and the colon. Our studies established that dietary fat, especially saturated fat, potentiates the development of colon tumors caused by B(a)P in the Apc(Min) mouse.
To evaluate and compare the drug response and side effects of adolescents with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol.
Forty-three patients were treated with olanzapine (n = 19), risperidone (n = 17) and haloperidol (n = 7) for 8 weeks in an open clinical trial. Clinical improvement was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and side effects with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale.
Significant clinical improvement was observed by week 4 for all medications. Olanzapine and haloperidol induced fatigability more frequently than risperidone. Haloperidol was associated with a higher frequency of depression and more severe extrapyramidal symptoms.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first study in adolescents to compare the efficacy and side effects of three most commonly prescribed antipsychotic medications. Olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol appear to be equally effective for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescent inpatients but have different side effect profiles.
Male ICR mice were administered thiabendazole (TBZ) in the diet at concentration of 0 (control), 0.8, 1.2 and 1.6% for 44 weeks. The mortality was 10, 6, 40 or 90% in control, 0.8, 1.2 or 1.6% TBZ group, respectively. In dead mice, the gross findings included the abnormalities of kidney such as atrophy, hydronephrosis or swelling in 2, 67, 95 or 96% of the 0, 0.8, 1.2 or 1.6% TBZ group, respectively. In surviving mice at the end of study, the right kidney weight of treated groups was significantly lower than that of control group. The urinary bladder weight of treated groups was significantly higher than that of control group. Gross findings in treated mice included the renal atrophy, hydronephrosis, calculi in renal pelvis or urinary bladder and thickening of the bladder wall. Microscopic findings in the kidneys of treated mice included nephrosis, hydronephrosis and hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of renal pelvis and/or papilla. In the urinary bladder, hyperplasia or squamous metaplasia of transitional epithelium were found in treated mice. Administration of TBZ in the diet for 44 weeks results in nephrosis and calculus formation in the renal pelvis and urinary bladder of male ICR mice, and is associated with hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of renal pelvis or urinary bladder.
