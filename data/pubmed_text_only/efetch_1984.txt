Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during critical developmental periods causes adverse consequences later in life; an example is prenatal exposure to the pharmaceutical diethylstilbestrol (DES). Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental estrogen used in the synthesis of plastics, is of concern because its chemical structure resembles that of DES, and it is a "high-volume production" chemical with widespread human exposure.
In this study we investigated whether prenatal BPA causes long-term adverse effects in female reproductive tissues in an experimental animal model previously shown useful in studying effects of prenatal DES.
Timed pregnant CD-1 mice were treated on days 9-16 of gestation with BPA (0.1, 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 mug/kg/day). After delivery, pups were held for 18 months; reproductive tissues were then evaluated.
Ovarian cysts were significantly increased in the 1-mug/kg BPA group; ovarian cyst-adenomas were seen in the other three BPA-treated groups but not in corn-oil controls. We observed increased progressive proliferative lesions of the oviduct after BPA treatment, similar to those described in response to DES. Further, although not statistically different from the controls, prominent mesonephric (Wolffian) remnants and squamous metaplasia of the uterus, as well as vaginal adenosis, were present in BPA-treated mice, similar to lesions reported following DES treatment. More severe pathologies observed in some BPA-treated animals included atypical hyperplasia and stromal polyps of the uterus; sarcoma of the uterine cervix; and mammary adenocarcinoma. We did not observe these lesions in controls.
These data suggest that BPA causes long-term adverse reproductive and carcinogenic effects if exposure occurs during critical periods of differentiation.
Methysergide ( Sansert ) has been associated with numerous fibrotic disorders. In particular, multiple cardiac lesions have been described in cases where methysergide was thought to have played a causative role. A patient is described who presented with cardiac findings suggestive of acute myopericarditis . An inflammatory myocarditis was subsequently excluded by endomyocardial biopsy. Hemodynamic findings suggested the presence of constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy, or both. Radiographic evidence of constrictive pericarditis and biopsy evidence of endocardial fibrosis were documented in this patient with a long history of interrupted methysergide therapy.
Technical grade methoxychlor (MXC) is an estrogenic pesticide currently used for pest control in the US. To determine the long-term effects of technical MXC on ovaries and estrous cycles, neonatal mice received 14 daily intraperitoneal injections of sesame oil only, 10.0 micrograms estradiol-17 beta, or 0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg, or 1.0 mg of technical MXC. At 3, 6, and 12 months, vaginal smears were examined for 12 d and ovaries collected. All technical MXC doses and estradiol increased the duration of vaginal cornification but only estradiol, 0.5, or 1.0 mg technical MXC induced ovarian atrophy, relative ovarian weight loss, and depletion of corpora lutea. Technical MXC doses of 0.05 or 0.1 mg produced the opposite effects; the ovaries remained heavy, large, and filled with corpora lutea. On the other hand, follicular cysts were recorded in all groups, except the 1.0 mg MXC group. These augmentary and inhibitory effects of MXC at low and high doses mimic the estrogen effects at low and high doses, and were probably due to the altered hypothalamic-hypophyseal function.
A phase II study of epirubicin, a new anthracycline derivative, was performed in 23 patients with advanced gastric cancer. Epirubicin was administered intravenously at a dose of 20-30 mg/m2/day for two or three consecutive days every two or three weeks. Sixteen cases were evaluable and there were two partial responses and one minor response. Overall response rate (more than PR) was 12.5% (2/16). Leukopenia (less than 4,000/mm3) and anemia (less than 11.0 g/dl) were observed in 71.4% and 69.2% of patients, respectively. No thrombocytopenia was observed. Other toxicities were alopecia (71.4%), nausea and vomiting (42.9%), anorexia (25.0%), stomatitis (12.5%), fatigue (12.5%), fever (6.3%) and tachycardia (6.3%), but these effects were relatively mild in most cases.
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a human immunodeficiency caused by mutations in Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) and characterized by an arrest in early B-cell development, near absence of serum immunoglobulin, and recurrent bacterial infections. Using Btk- and Tec-deficient mice (BtkTec(-/-)) as a model for XLA, we determined if Btk gene therapy could correct this disorder. Bone marrow (BM) from 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-treated BtkTec(-/-) mice was transduced with a retroviral vector expressing human Btk and transplanted into BtkTec(-/-) recipients. Mice engrafted with transduced hematopoietic cells exhibited rescue of both primary and peripheral B-lineage development, recovery of peritoneal B1 B cells, and correction of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG(3) levels. Gene transfer also restored T-independent type II immune responses, and B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) proliferative responses. B-cell progenitors derived from Btk-transduced stem cells exhibited higher levels of Btk expression than non-B cells; and marking studies demonstrated a selective advantage for Btk-transduced B-lineage cells. BM derived from primary recipients also rescued Btk-dependent function in secondary hosts that had received a transplant. Together, these data demonstrate that gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells can reconstitute Btk-dependent B-cell development and function in vivo, and strongly support the feasibility of pursuing Btk gene transfer for XLA.
Cyclosporin is associated with significant chronic nephrotoxicity, manifest in the long term mainly as renal fibrosis. There have been claims that tacrolimus is a less fibrotic drug than cyclosporin, and this study was designed to determine the effect of the two drugs on the expression of fibrosis-associated genes.
Male Wistar rats underwent clamping of the right renal pedicle for 45 min together with left nephrectomy; this model has previously been shown to be associated with upregulation of fibrosis-associated genes. Experimental groups (six animals per group) received cyclosporin A 10 mg/kg daily, tacrolimus 0.2 mg/kg daily or no treatment. Animals were killed at 16 weeks, and the renal cortical expression of fibrosis-associated genes was studied by means of quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Tacrolimus-treated animals developed significantly less proteinuria and had lower serum creatinine levels than those receiving cyclosporin. Tacrolimus administration also significantly reduced the expression of transforming growth factor beta and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, both the products of genes associated with fibrosis. Although cyclosporin treatment reduced levels of the matrix-degrading enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP-9, this was not statistically significant.
Tacrolimus has less nephrotoxicity than cyclosporin in this model. It also appears to have less fibrogenic potential, and this may have implications for the choice of long-term immunosuppressant in renal transplantation.
Schizophrenic patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) often develop excessive body weight gain (BWG), which may lead to further morbidity and poor treatment compliance. This study examined whether genetic variants in the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene may be associated with body weight change after AAP treatment.
The study included 479 schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine (n=239), olanzapine (n=70) or risperidone (n=170) for an average of 48.2+/-27.8 months. BWG was defined as an increase of more than 7% of the baseline body weight during AAP treatment. Thirteen common single nucleotide polymorphisms of the DRD2 gene were chosen as tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms.
In single-marker-based analysis, the DRD2 rs4436578-C homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of BWG [P=0.001, adjusted odds ratio=3.36 (95% confidence interval=1.62 - 7.00)]. In addition, haplotype analysis further showed that the rs4436578-C-allele-related haplotype was more frequent in those patients with BWG than those without (P=0.01 - 0.00019).
Our findings confirm the importance of genetic factors in body weight change induced by long-term AAP treatment in patients with schizophrenia and indicate a role of DRD2 in body weight regulation during long-term AAP treatment.
Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are found globally in wildlife and humans and are suspected to act as endocrine disruptors. There are no previous reports of PFAA levels in adult men from Denmark or of a possible association between semen quality and PFAA exposure.
We investigated possible associations between PFAAs and testicular function. We hypothesized that higher PFAA levels would be associated with lower semen quality and lower testosterone levels.
We analyzed serum samples for levels of 10 different PFAAs and reproductive hormones and assessed semen quality in 105 Danish men from the general population (median age, 19 years).
Considerable levels of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid were found in all young men (medians of 24.5, 4.9, and 6.6 ng/mL, respectively). Men with high combined levels of PFOS and PFOA had a median of 6.2 million normal spermatozoa in their ejaculate in contrast to 15.5 million among men with low PFOS-PFOA (p = 0.030). In addition, we found nonsignificant trends with regard to lower sperm concentration, lower total sperm counts, and altered pituitary-gonadal hormones among men with high PFOS-PFOA levels.
High PFAA levels were associated with fewer normal sperm. Thus, high levels of PFAAs may contribute to the otherwise unexplained low semen quality often seen in young men. However, our findings need to be corroborated in larger studies.
In our earlier experiments prolonged administration of the stable PgI2 analogue: 7-oxo-PgI2 ephedrine salt to dogs afforded a long-lasting protection against coronary occlusion induced ischemia as well as against postocclusion and reperfusion arrhythmias. In the present experiments we wanted to clear, whether this prolonged protective action is present in other types of arrhythmia, which are not due to ischemia. The ouabain-arrhythmia seemed to be suitable for elucidation of this question. Therefore guinea pigs were pretreated with 50 micrograms/kg i.p. 7-oxo-PgI2 and 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs after treatment anesthetized with 35 mg/kg sodium pentobarbitone. To prevent ouabain bradycardia, 0.4 mg/kg atropine was administered i.p. Ouabain was applied by intermittent infusion technique i.e. an initial infusion for 5 minutes of a total dose of 60 micrograms/kg into the right jugular vein was followed after a 25 minutes interval by infusions of 30 micrograms/kg for 2.5 minutes every 10 minutes until cardiac arrest. The ouabain induced rhythm disturbances appeared in the following order: Anomalies in T wave morphology, ventricular or nodal extrasystoles, atrio-ventricular and intraventricular conduction disturbances, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and finally cardiac arrest. If 50 micrograms/kg i.p. 7-oxo-PgI2 was given to ouabain-intoxicated animals at the appearance of the first extrasystole a transient aggravation of this arrhythmia developed. In 7-oxo-PgI2 pretreated animals the total amount of ouabain necessary to induced rhythm disturbances was markedly elevated, the appearance of the various arrhythmias significantly delayed. Maximal protective effects were seen 48 hrs after the administration of 50 micrograms/kg 7-oxo-PgI2.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, including infant formula bottles.
Based on the reported endocrine disruptor activity of this polyphenol, we hypothesized that exposure to BPA early in life would elicit developmental changes in the mammary tissue and cause a predisposition for mammary cancer.
We exposed neonatal/prepubertal rats to BPA via lactation from nursing dams treated orally with 0, 25, and 250 mug BPA/kg body weight/day. For tumorigenesis studies, female offspring were exposed to 30 mg dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)/kg body weight at 50 days of age.
The combination of DMBA treatment with lactational exposure to BPA demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in mammary tumor multiplicity and reduced tumor latency compared with controls. In the absence of DMBA treatment, lactational BPA exposure resulted in increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis at 50 but not 21 days postpartum (shortly after last BPA treatment). Using Western blot analysis, we determined that steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) 1-3, Akt, phosphorylated Akt, progesterone receptor A (PR-A), and erbB3 proteins were significantly up-regulated at 50 days of age.
The data presented here provide the first evidence that maternal exposure to BPA during lactation increases mammary carcinogenesis in a DMBA-induced model of rodent mammary cancer. Changes in PR-A, SRC 1-3, erbB3, and Akt activity are consistent with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis playing a role in mammary cancer susceptibility. These alterations provide an explanation of enhanced mammary carcinogenesis after lactational BPA exposure.
The effects of diabetes on heart function may be initiated or compounded by the exaggerated reliance of the diabetic heart on fatty acids and ketones as metabolic fuels. beta-Blocking agents such as metoprolol have been proposed to inhibit fatty acid oxidation. We hypothesized that metoprolol would improve cardiac function by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation and promoting a compensatory increase in glucose utilization. We measured ex vivo cardiac function and substrate utilization after chronic metoprolol treatment and acute metoprolol perfusion. Chronic metoprolol treatment attenuated the development of cardiac dysfunction in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. After chronic treatment with metoprolol, palmitate oxidation was increased in control hearts but decreased in diabetic hearts without affecting myocardial energetics. Acute treatment with metoprolol during heart perfusions led to reduced rates of palmitate oxidation, stimulation of glucose oxidation, and increased tissue ATP levels. Metoprolol lowered malonyl-CoA levels in control hearts only, but no changes in acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation or AMP-activated protein kinase activity were observed. Both acute metoprolol perfusion and chronic in vivo metoprolol treatment led to decreased maximum activity and decreased sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I to malonyl-CoA. Metoprolol also increased sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase expression and prevented the reexpression of atrial natriuretic peptide in diabetic hearts. These data demonstrate that metoprolol ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy and inhibits fatty acid oxidation in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Since malonyl-CoA levels are not increased, the reduction in total carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity is the most likely factor to explain the decrease in fatty acid oxidation. The metabolism changes occur in parallel with changes in gene expression.
A 47-year-old woman who presented with hip pain as a result of osteoarthritis was treated with indometacin. Ten days after beginning treatment she developed jaundice and ascites. All medications were discontinued, but her symptoms continued to worsen.
Physical examination, laboratory tests and radiologic examinations, including liver chemistry tests, viral serologies, serum iron studies, ceruloplasmin and alpha-fetoprotein analyses, autoimmune serologies, ascites studies, abdominal CT, liver ultrasound and liver biopsy.
Severe biopsy-proven hepatitis that progressed to chronic autoimmune hepatitis.
Treatment with prednisone 40 mg/day was initially successful. The dose of the therapy was tapered over 18 months and then discontinued, after which time the patient's liver chemistry test results worsened. Repeat liver biopsy samples showed evidence of chronic hepatitis, and her liver chemistry test results improved when prednisone was restarted. The patient was maintained on 750 mg twice-daily mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone was decreased to 5 mg every other day.
Heparin is widely used in current practice for a variety of indications. It is well known that it can cause thrombocytopenia, but not that thrombosis may also develop in thrombocytopenic patients and cause significant morbidity and mortality. A 56-year-old woman developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that resulted in the amputation of her leg. It is proposed that the reaction has an immune-mediated mechanism. Several ways of diagnosing the condition are available, specifically the serotonin-release assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The investigational agent danaproid may be effective in the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis.
Although many studies have examined the effects of air pollution on mortality, data limitations have resulted in fewer studies of both particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <or= 2.5 microm (PM(2.5); fine particles) and of coarse particles (particles with an aerodynamic diameter > 2.5 and < 10 microm; PM coarse). We conducted a national, multicity time-series study of the acute effect of PM(2.5) and PM coarse on the increased risk of death for all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and respiratory mortality for the years 1999-2005.
We applied a city- and season-specific Poisson regression in 112 U.S. cities to examine the association of mean (day of death and previous day) PM(2.5) and PM coarse with daily deaths. We combined the city-specific estimates using a random effects approach, in total, by season and by region.
We found a 0.98% increase [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-1.22] in total mortality, a 0.85% increase (95% CI, 0.46-1.24) in CVD, a 1.18% increase (95% CI, 0.48-1.89) in MI, a 1.78% increase (95% CI, 0.96-2.62) in stroke, and a 1.68% increase (95% CI, 1.04-2.33) in respiratory deaths for a 10-microg/m(3) increase in 2-day averaged PM(2.5). The effects were higher in spring. For PM coarse, we found significant but smaller increases for all causes analyzed.
We conclude that our analysis showed an increased risk of mortality for all and specific causes associated with PM(2.5), and the risks are higher than what was previously observed for PM(10). In addition, coarse particles are also associated with more deaths.
A Tourette-like syndrome (TLS) may occur after long-term neuroleptic treatment. A review of 11 cases reported in the literature is given. We describe the onset of a TLS in a 13-year old boy with childhood schizophrenia after short term, low-dose treatment with thioridazine. The syndrome resolved 5 months after neuroleptic withdrawal. Subsequent exposure to neuroleptics (mainly perphenazine) induced a recurrence of motor tics and involuntary vocalizations which resolved on drug discontinuation. Awareness that neuroleptics may induce a TLS may lead to prompt recognition and avoidance of labelling the manifestations as symptoms of the underlying psychosis or attention-seeking behaviour.
Carboplatin, a second-generation platinum-containing anti-cancer drug, is currently being used against human cancers. High-dose carboplatin chemotherapy can cause renal tubular injury in cancer patients. We have shown a dose-dependent nephrotoxicity of carboplatin in a rat model. However, the time response of carboplatin-induced renal injury has not been explored. This study investigated the time response of carboplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rat. Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were divided into two groups of 30 animals each and treated as follows: (1) control (saline, intraperitoneally) and (2) carboplatin (256 mg kg(-1), intraperitoneally). The animals (n = 6) from each group were sacrificed 1-5 days after treatment. The blood and kidneys were isolated and analyzed. Plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood urea levels were increased significantly in response to carboplatin in a time-dependent manner, indicating potential nephrotoxicity. Carboplatin time-dependently increased the renal platinum concentration, renal xanthine oxidase activity, increased membrane lipid peroxidation (MDA) concentration, while ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) depleted significantly, indicating oxidative renal injury. Renal anti-oxidant enzymes, such as cytosolic copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and mitochondrial manganese (Mn)-SOD, catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were decreased significantly due to carboplatin 3-5 days post-treatment. The protein expressions of renal CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD significantly depleted 3-5 days after carboplatin administration, indicating decline in de novo synthesis of enzyme proteins. The data suggested that carboplatin caused time-dependent oxidative renal injury, as evidenced by renal anti-oxidant depletion, enhanced lipid peroxidation, platinum content, plasma creatinine BUN, and blood urea levels in rats.
A previous study on furosemide-induced nephrocalcinosis (NC) showed only partial resolution of the calcifications after discontinuation of the diuretic. We investigated whether treatment with chlorothiazide (CTZ) will expedite the resolution of established furosemide-induced NC. Seventy-eight weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into eight groups. Three groups were studied for 1 week: A, control; B, furosemide 40 mg/kg per 24 h; C, CTZ 100 mg/kg per 24 h. Five groups were studied for 5 weeks: D, control; E, F, G, furosemide 40 mg/kg per 24 h for 1 week followed by 4 weeks of observation (E), CTZ 50 mg/kg per 24 h (F), and CTZ 100 mg/kg per 24 h (G) and; and CTZ 100 mg/kg per 24 h (H) for 5 weeks. At the end of each study period urine and blood were collected, one kidney was studied histologically and the contralateral ashed for quantitative calcium (Ca) analysis. Animals in group B developed NC with a kidney Ca content of 1,844 +/- 203 micrograms/g dry tissue compared with group A 248 +/- 86 (P < 0.05) and group C 256 +/- 56 (P < 0.05). There were no differences among the three groups with regard to creatinine clearance, urine phosphate (P) or Ca excretion, although the latter tended to be lower in group C. Animals in group E showed a reduction in the magnitude of NC, with kidney Ca of 550 +/- 398 micrograms/g dry tissue, which was lower than in group B (P < 0.05) but still higher than in groups D (140 +/- 27) (P < 0.05) or H (162 +/- 63) (P < 0.05). Kidney Ca content in groups F (497 +/- 142) and G (489 +/- 271 micrograms/g dry tissue) was similar to that in group E. There were no differences among the five groups with regard to creatinine clearance or urine P excretion. Urine Ca excretion was significantly lower in groups F and G than groups D and E. We conclude that once established, NC caused by furosemide is not affected by CTZ therapy in spite of the anticalciuric property of the latter.
Metastatic prostate cancer is treated with drugs that antagonize androgen action, but most patients progress to a more aggressive form of the disease called castration-resistant prostate cancer, driven by elevated expression of the androgen receptor. Here we characterize the diarylthiohydantoins RD162 and MDV3100, two compounds optimized from a screen for nonsteroidal antiandrogens that retain activity in the setting of increased androgen receptor expression. Both compounds bind to the androgen receptor with greater relative affinity than the clinically used antiandrogen bicalutamide, reduce the efficiency of its nuclear translocation, and impair both DNA binding to androgen response elements and recruitment of coactivators. RD162 and MDV3100 are orally available and induce tumor regression in mouse models of castration-resistant human prostate cancer. Of the first 30 patients treated with MDV3100 in a Phase I/II clinical trial, 13 of 30 (43%) showed sustained declines (by >50%) in serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen, a biomarker of prostate cancer. These compounds thus appear to be promising candidates for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
To investigate the apoptosis-inducing effect of cantharidin in human lung cancer cells A549 and its molecular mechanisms.
MTT assay was used to determine A549 cells proliferation. Light and electron microscopy, FACScan, Annexin V-FITC staining and DNA gel electrophoresis were used to detect apoptosis. The expression of bcl-2, Bax and survivin were examined by Western blot.
Cantharidin inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells. The cells treated with cantharidin showed a typical apoptotic morphology and hypodiploid peak before G(1) phase. Flow cytometry analysis with annexin quantitatively further confirmed the increase of cell apoptosis. DNA of treated A549 cells depicted a ladder pattern characteristic of apoptosis, indicating the presence of DNA fragmentation. Western blot assay showed that cantharidin increased the level of Bax expression and inhibited the level of bcl-2 and survivin expression.
Cantharidin can induce A549 cells apoptosis mainly via regulation of Bax, bcl-2 and survivin expression.
Nine cases of intracranial hemorrhages related to cocaine usage are presented. Another 5 cases from the literature are reviewed. The relationship between severe cocaine-induced hypertension, and the development of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhages is noted, and apparently is related to sudden transient increases of blood pressure related to cocaine use.
Arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids and its downstream pathways have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in growth control of breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate that isoliquiritigenin, a flavonoid phytoestrogen from licorice, induces growth inhibition and apoptosis through downregulating multiple key enzymes in AA metabolic network and the deactivation of PI3K/Akt in human breast cancer. Isoliquiritigenin diminished cell viability, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, and clonogenic ability in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells, and induced apoptosis as evidenced by an analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry and hoechst staining. Furthermore, isoliquiritigenin inhibited mRNA expression of multiple forms of AA-metabolizing enzymes, including phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenases (COX)-2 and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A, and decreased secretion of their products, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), without affecting COX-1, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). In addition, it downregulated the levels of phospho-PI3K, phospho-PDK (Ser(241)), phospho-Akt (Thr(308)), phospho-Bad (Ser(136)), and Bcl-xL expression, thereby activating caspase cascades and eventually cleaving poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Conversely, the addition of exogenous eicosanoids, including PGE2, LTB4 and a 20-HETE analog (WIT003), and caspase inhibitors, or overexpression of constitutively active Akt reversed isoliquiritigenin-induced apoptosis. Notably, isoliquiritigenin induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice, together with decreased intratumoral levels of eicosanoids and phospho-Akt (Thr(308)). Collectively, these data suggest that isoliquiritigenin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis through downregulating AA metabolic network and the deactivation of PI3K/Akt in human breast cancer.
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium endocarditis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. We describe a patient with hairy-cell leukemia and vancomycin-resistant E faecium endocarditis. The patient presented with severe aortic insufficiency. He underwent aortic root replacement with a cryopreserved aortic homograft and was treated with a combination of quinupristin/dalfopristin, ampicillin, and gentamicin.
To study the effects of transmitters ET, AgII, PGI(2), CGRP and GG on experimental rat hepatic fibrosis and the antifibrogenic effects of IL-10.
One hundred SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group (N): intraperitoneal injection with saline 2 ml.kg(-1) twice a week; the fibrogenesis group (C): intraperitoneal injection with 50 % CCl(4) 2 ml.kg(-1) twice a week; IL-10 treated group (E): besides same dosage of CCl(4) given, intraperitoneal injection with IL-10 4 ug.kg(-1) from the third week. In the fifth, the seventh and the ninth week, rats in three groups were selected randomly to collect plasma and liver tissues. The levels of ET, AgII, PGI(2), CGRP and GG were assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The liver fibrosis was observed with silver staining.
The hepatic fibrosis was developed with the increase of the injection frequency of CCl(4). The ET, AgII, PGI(2), CGRP and GG levels in serum of group N were 71.84+/-60.2 ng.L(-1), 76.21+/-33.3 ng/L, 313.03+/-101.71 ng/L, 61.97+/-21.4 ng/L and 33.62+/-14.37 ng/L, respectively; the levels of them in serum of group C were 523.30+/-129.3 ng/L, 127.24+/-50.0 ng/L, 648.91+/-357.29 ng/L, 127.15+/-62.0 ng/L and 85.26+/-51.83 ng/L, respectively; the levels of them in serum of group E were 452.52+/-99.5 ng/L, 90.60+/-44.7 ng/L, 475.57+/-179.70 ng/L, 102.2+/-29.7 ng/L and 38.05+/-19.94 ng/L, respectively. The histological examination showed that the degrees of the rats liver fibrosis in group E were lower than those in group C.
The transmitters ET, AgII, PGI(2), CGRP and GG play a significant role in the rat hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl(4). IL-10 has the antagonistic action on these transmitters and can relieve the degree of the liver fibrosis.
Rapid reversal of the anticoagulatory effect of vitamin K antagonists represents the primary emergency treatment for oral anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage (OAC-ICH). Predicting the amount of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) needed to reverse OAC in individual patients is difficult, and repeated international normalized ratio (INR) measurements in central laboratories (CLs) are time-consuming. Accuracy and effectiveness of point-of-care INR coagulometers (POCs) for INR reversal in OAC-ICH have not been evaluated.
In phase 1, the agreement of emergency POC and CL INR measurements was determined. In phase 2, stepwise OAC reversal was performed with PCC using a predetermined dosing schedule. Concordance of POC and CL INR measurements during reversal and time gain due to POC were determined.
In phase 1 (n = 165), Bland-Altman analysis showed close agreement between POCs and CLs (mean INR deviation 0.04). In phase 2 (n = 26), POCs caused a median initial net time gain of 24 minutes for the start of treatment with PCC. Median time for POC-documented complete OAC reversal was 28 minutes, compared with 120 minutes for CLs. Bland-Altman analysis between POCs and CLs revealed a mean INR deviation of 0.13 during stepwise PCC administration. POCs tended to slightly overestimate the INR, especially at higher INR levels. Remarkably, POC-guided reversal led to a median reduction of 30.5% of PCC dose compared with the a priori dose calculation. Hematomas enlarged in 20% of patients.
POC INR monitoring is a fast, effective, and economic means of PCC dose-titration in OAC-ICH. Larger studies examining the clinical efficacy of this procedure are warranted.
