Increasing evidences in both experimental and clinical studies suggest that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic tissue damage. Pancreatic beta-cell death is the cause of decreased insulin production in diabetes. Streptozotocin (STZ) is widely used to induce experimental diabetes due to its ability to selectively target and destroy insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells via the formation of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and RNS (reactive nitrogen species). This study investigated the prophylactic role of arjunolic acid (AA) against STZ-induced diabetes in the pancreas tissue of the Swiss albino rats (as a working model). We observed that STZ administration (at a dose of 65mg/kg body weight, injected in the tail vain) caused increased production of both ROS and RNS in the pancreas tissue of experimental animals. Formation of these reactive intermediates decreased the intracellular antioxidant defense, increased the levels of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, serum glucose and TNF-alpha. Investigating the signaling pathways, we found that STZ administration caused the activation of phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38, NF-kappaB and destruction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c as well as activation of caspase 3 in the pancreas tissue keeping the levels of total ERK1/2 and p38 significantly unchanged. Treatment of animals with AA (at a dose of 20mg/kg body weight, orally) both prior and post to the STZ administration effectively reduced these adverse effects by inhibiting the excessive ROS and RNS formation as well as by down-regulating the activation of phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38, NF-kappaB and mitochondrial dependent signal transduction pathways leading to apoptotic cell death. Combining all, these results suggest that AA plays some beneficial roles against STZ-induced diabetes.
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition causes specific renal effects, such as a rise in effective renal plasma flow, a fall in filtration fraction and a lowering of proteinuria. The mechanism of these renal effects is still debated. Recent animal studies suggest that non-angiotensin (Ang) II related actions of ACE inhibition, such as bradykinin accumulation, may have a role. We therefore investigated the effects of specific intervention in the renin-angiotensin system with the Ang II receptor antagonist losartan, and compared these effects to those obtained with ACE inhibition, as this comparison might resolve the question whether or not the effects of ACE inhibition are Ang II related. The effects of losartan and enalapril were studied in eleven patients with non-diabetic proteinuria and hypertension. The protocol consisted of seven periods, each lasting one month, in which patients received once daily placebo, 50 mg losartan, 100 mg losartan, placebo, 10 mg enalapril, 20 mg enalapril, and placebo, respectively. At the end of each study period proteinuria, blood pressure, and renal function were determined. On both doses of losartan and enalapril proteinuria and blood pressure fell, whereas ERPF increased and GFR remained stable. The fall in urinary protein excretion was similar for both drugs: 46.3% (28.3% to 63.1%) on 100 mg losartan versus 51.6% (37.0% to 69.2%) on 20 mg enalapril (expressed as Wilcoxon-based estimated median with 95% CI).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Researchers have found that melatonin substantially reduced both sleep onset latency and the number of nocturnal awakenings in normal individuals as well as patients with diverse sleep pathologies. These findings have led to an increase in the number of individuals who ingest melatonin habitually to alleviate their sleep problem. Given the widespread use of melatonin, it is important to identify the factors capable of predicting physiological states while following a melatonin regimen. The result of this preliminary analysis showed that the number of hours spent outdoors is the best predictor of subjective sleepiness while under the influence of melatonin. Specifically, the more time individuals spend outdoors, the sleepier they are when administered melatonin.
Six patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) who developed neuromuscular symptoms associated with vesicular changes in muscle fibres are reported. Two patients in the advanced stages of AIDS, who did not receive zidovudine, developed proximal limb weakness and wasting: both had a necrotising myopathy with an unusual segmental vesicular change of myofibres. There were numerous vesicles 0.1 to 2 microns in diameter produced by dilatations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in fibres depleted of myofibrils. Four patients developed a myopathy while receiving zidovudine for AIDS. One of these had an inflammatory myopathy which showed the development of vesicular change due to enlargement and electron lucency of mitochondria. The three other patients with ARC developed muscle pains or weakness and elevated serum CK while on zidovudine. These patients also showed vesicular changes due to enlargement and electron lucency of mitochondria associated with disruption of sarcomeres and the presence of cytoplasmic bodies. The muscular symptoms resolved when ziduvodine was stopped and repeat biopsy in one case revealed no abnormalities.
The fact that levodopa, a drug used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease induces a direct Coombs-positive reaction in about 15% of treated patients, indicating the presence of auto-antibodies against the patient's red blood cells (RBCs), is well known. Another known fact is that only 1% of those patients do actually develop auto-immune haemolytic anaemia. In this paper, we describe our findings utilizing the direct ELISA, a method for measuring the presence of IgM and IgG auto-antibodies on the patients' red blood cells (RBCs), as well as an indirect ELISA, testing the presence of antibodies in their serum. The tests were performed on 8 patients, 7 of whom had been receiving the drug for long periods of time. Our results show that the serum antibodies precede the bound antibodies in a significant fashion and that the severity of the anaemia is directly related to the amount of auto-antibodies. Since auto-antibodies do not seem to be directed against the drug itself, some modification of the RBC must occur. For this reason, we attempted to determine whether patients receiving the drug show any morphological changes of their RBCs which could be determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and whether these changes could be related to direct and indirect ELISA. In most levodopa-treated patients, a small number of echinocytes could be observed by SEM, while in 1 patient who suffered a severe anaemic phase, a very high percentage of the RBCs were echinocytes and spherocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Meige's syndrome is characterized by blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia. Three cases are presented; two were associated with long-term neuroleptic administration. This drug-induced syndrome may be a variant of tardive dystonia, and prompt discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment may be therapeutic.
The present study investigated a potential role for glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors in the detrimental effects of single cocaine (COC) administration on both the number of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)-positive neurons and the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat dentate gyrus (DG). The effects of COC (15 mg/kg i.p.) on the number of PSA-NCAM-positive neurons and the induction of LTP observed 2 days after COC administration were abolished either by depleting circulating corticosterone after administration of metyrapone (100 mg/kg s.c. given 3 h before COC) or by pharmacologically blocking GRs using mifepristone (RU 38486, 10 mg/kg s.c. given 1 h before COC). Administration of the MR blocker spironolactone (50 mg/kg s.c. given 1 h before COC) did not alter the effects of COC on the number of PSA-NCAM-positive neurons or LTP induction. Results have also shown that COC does not change the rate of cell proliferation, as measured by the presence of Ki-67 and the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (100 mg/kg i.p. given 2 h after COC) into the newly born cells in the DG 2 days after COC administration. Finally, we observed that GRs colocalized with some, but not all, PSA-NCAM-positive neurons, whereas MRs showed no colocalization with neurons positive for PSA-NCAM in the DG. These data indicate that a single dose of COC may arrest hippocampal susceptibility to plastic changes and lead to functional impairments through the alteration of hippocampal structure and the formation of memory traces.
In a double blind, crossover study 6 h infusions of adrenaline (15 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.458 pmol), noradrenaline (30 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.911 pmol), and a 5% dextrose solution (5.4 ml/h), were given to ten healthy volunteers in random order 2 weeks apart. By means of intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring the haemodynamic effects were followed for 18 h after the infusions were stopped. Adrenaline, but not noradrenaline, caused a delayed and protracted pressor effect. Over the total postinfusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 (SEM 2)% and 7 (2)%, respectively, higher than after dextrose infusion (ANOVA, p less than 0.001). Thus, "stress" levels of adrenaline (230 pg/ml) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect. These findings are strong support for the adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis in man.
The administration of D-penicillamine (450 mg/kg) to young rats resulted in an immediate increase in urinary NAG and volume, as well as mild proteinuria of a predominently low molecular weight type. Doses less than 400 mg/kg failed to alter the urinary profile. Analysis of glomerular basement membrane prepared from rats injected with D-penicillamine (450 mg/kg) failed to show any abnormalities in amino acid and sugar composition. In contrast, glomerular basement membrane prepared from D-penicillamine injected rats was more soluble than membrane prepared from normal rats in SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol. The solubilised components of the membrane were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An increase in the low molecular weight, and a concomitant fall in the higher molecular weight components present in the membrane was demonstrated. D-penicillamine therefore affects glomerular basement membrane directly in young rats, possibly by interfering with cross-link formation. These studies may provide a further basis for the study of D-penicillamine toxicity in man.
We report the case of a child with partial biotinidase deficiency and autistic developmental disorder. We arrived at the diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency when the child was almost 4 years of age. Consequently, he began cofactor biotin treatment (10 mg daily) which did not resolve his autistic behavior. His younger brother was affected by partial biotinidase deficiency diagnosed at birth through our neonatal screening program. He was precociously treated with cofactor biotin therapy (10 mg daily) and did not show any behavioral abnormality or developmental delay. Since the brain is quite vulnerable to biotin deficiency, delayed biotin therapy could result in neurological damage. Our patient is the first case of partial biotinidase deficiency associated with autism. We hypothesize that the low biotinidase activity could have caused biotin deficiency in his brain and cerebrospinal fluids and consequently serious neurological problems, such as stereotyped and autistic behaviors, which were irreversible in spite of biotin supplementation.
Activating mutations in the Kras gene are commonly found in some but not all epithelial cancers. In order to understand the susceptibility of different epithelial tissues to Kras-induced tumorigenesis, we introduced one of the most common Kras mutations, Kras(G12D), broadly in epithelial tissues. We used a mouse model in which the G12D mutation is placed in the endogenous Kras locus controlled by inducible, Cre-mediated recombination in tissues expressing cytokeratin 19 including the oral cavity, GI tract, lungs, and ducts of the liver, kidney, and the pancreas. Introduction of the Kras(G12D) mutation in adult mouse tissues led to neoplastic changes in some but not all of these tissues. Notably, many hyperplasias, metaplasias and adenomas were observed in the oral cavity, stomach, colon and lungs, suggesting that exposure to products of the outside environment promotes Kras(G12D)-initiated tumorigenesis. However, environmental exposure did not consistently correlate with tumor formation, such as in the small intestine, suggesting that there are also intrinsic differences in susceptibility to Kras activation. The pancreas developed small numbers of mucinous metaplasias with characteristics of early stage pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs), supporting the hypothesis that pancreatic ducts have the potential to give rise pancreatic cancer.
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of gamma-synuclein in the rewarding effects of chronic cocaine administration and its putative interaction with the dopamine transporter (DAT). For this purpose, regulatable lentiviruses driving overexpression of the rat gamma-synuclein or DAT have been prepared, as well as lentiviruses expressing siRNAs, aimed at silencing either DAT or gamma-synuclein mRNA expression. Overexpression of DAT in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) induced a 35% decrease in locomotor activity, which could be abolished when the same animal was fed doxycycline. Furthermore, local inhibition of DAT in the NAc, using lentiviruses expressing siRNAs targeted against DAT, resulted in significant hyperlocomotion activity (72% increase over controls). By contrast, overexpression of gamma-synuclein in the NAc alone had no effect, while local silencing lead to a significant decrease in cocaine-induced locomotor activity (47% decrease compared with controls). Surprisingly, coinjection lentiviruses expressing DAT and gamma-synuclein - leading to overexpression of both proteins in the NAc - resulted in a strong increase in cocaine-induced rat locomotor activity (52% increase compared with controls), which was abolished upon locally silencing these genes, suggesting a synergetic role of both proteins, possibly mediated through a direct interaction.
Metastatic malignant melanoma is an extremely aggressive cancer, with no currently viable therapy. 4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol (eugenol) was tested for its ability to inhibit proliferation of melanoma cells. Eugenol but not its isomer, isoeugenol (2-methoxy-4-propenylphenol), was found to be a potent inhibitor of melanoma cell proliferation. In a B16 xenograft study, eugenol treatment produced a significant tumor growth delay (p = 0.0057), an almost 40% decrease in tumor size, and a 19% increase in the median time to end point. More significantly, 50% of the animals in the control group died from metastatic growth, whereas none in the treatment group showed any signs of invasion or metastasis. Eugenol was well tolerated as determined by measurement of bodyweights. Examination of the mechanism of the antiproliferative action of eugenol in the human malignant melanoma cell line, WM1205Lu, showed that it arrests cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Flow cytometry coupled with biochemical analyses demonstrated that eugenol induced apoptosis. cDNA array analysis showed that eugenol caused deregulation of the E2F family of transcription factors. Transient transfection assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that eugenol inhibits the transcriptional activity of E2F1. Overexpression of E2F1 restored about 75% of proliferation ability in cultures. These results indicate that deregulation of E2F1 may be a key factor in eugenol-mediated melanoma growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Since the E2F transcription factors provide growth impetus for the continuous proliferation of melanoma cells, these results suggest that eugenol could be developed as an E2F-targeted agent for melanoma treatment.
An 18-year-old adolescent with cystic fibrosis developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding.
History, physical examination, upper and lower endoscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy were performed.
Upper and lower endoscopy did not reveal cause of persistent bleeding. Wireless capsule endoscopy revealed pan-gastrointestinal ischemic injury. Further discussion with the patient revealed recent cocaine ingestion.
Most reported cases of gut injury following cocaine abuse describe juxtapyloric and colonic injury; this case demonstrates that ischemic gut injury after cocaine use can be extensive and may be the reason for the associated high mortality.
Furazolidone is a nitrofuran drug which causes dilated cardiomyopathy in turkeys and serves as an important model of human dilated cardiomyopathy. Although extensively investigated, the chemical mechanism by which furazolidone produces injury remains unknown. In this work we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to show that furazolidone was reduced to its corresponding nitro anion radical by ascorbate and hypoxanthine. Glutathione prevented the generation of this anion radical. These results document directly, with EPR spectroscopy, the presence of furazolidone anion radical during biochemical reduction and suggest a protective role of glutathione in furazolidone-induced injury. These data enhance our understanding of furazolidone metabolism and may be useful in defining its role in furazolidone-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.
We have examined the differences in ventilatory characteristics between halothane and sevoflurane when used for adult vital capacity induction of anaesthesia. The study was conducted in a randomized, double-blind manner. After 13 patients had been enrolled, the study was curtailed because the blinded observer thought that there was an unacceptably high incidence of adverse events. After the randomization code was revealed, the adverse events were found to be in the halothane group. Although the sample size was small, minute volumes appeared to be maintained in the sevoflurane group. Ventilatory frequencies were similar in the two groups after insertion of the laryngeal mask airway, but tidal volumes were significantly greater in the sevoflurane group (P = 0.0013).
Excessive maternal caffeine consumption can lead to fetal and neonatal pathology, but the underlying mechanisms have not been determined. Here, we report that low doses of caffeine generate seizures when applied in conjunction with brief anoxic episodes in the hippocampus of neonatal rats in vitro. In control conditions, brief (4-6 minutes) anoxic episodes reversibly depressed evoked synaptic responses and blocked the physiological pattern of network activity. In the presence of caffeine (50 microM), similar anoxic episodes generated ictal (29%) or interictal (33%) epileptiform activities often followed during reoxygenation by recurrent spontaneous seizure activity that persisted for several hours. These effects are likely mediated by a blockade of adenosine receptors by caffeine because (1) in control conditions, caffeine antagonized the inhibitory effect of selective A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine on excitatory synaptic responses, and (2) epileptogenic effects of caffeine were reproduced by selective A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine and theophylline. Our findings suggest that endogenous adenosine released during anoxia acting via A1 receptors prevents seizures in the neonatal hippocampus and that the antagonism of these receptors by caffeine leads to epileptogenesis. This study suggests concerns about the safety of caffeine in the fetus and newborn.
We investigated the role of galanin (Gal) in the suppression of baroreceptor reflex (BRR) response by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats that were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Electrical stimulation (10-s train of 1-ms rectangular pulses at 20-40 microA and 10-20 Hz) of, and microinjection of L-glutamate (1 nmol) into, the PVN significantly inhibited BRR response to transient hypertension induced by phenylephrine (5 micrograms/kg iv). Such a PVN-induced BRR suppression was appreciably antagonized by local administration of Gal antiserum (1:20), but not heat-inactivated Gal antiserum (1:20), to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) bilaterally. Microinjection of Gal (100 pmol) into the NTS bilaterally also resulted in a Gal antiserum-reversible inhibition of the BRR response. Immunohistochemical results demonstrated that the distribution of Gal-containing neurons in the parvocellular subnucleus of the PVN overlapped substantially with the hypothalamic loci on which electrical or chemical activation elicited suppression of the BRR response that was significantly blunted by microinjection of Gal antiserum into the NTS. These results suggest that the PVN may participate in central cardiovascular regulation by suppressing the BRR response via galaninergic neurotransmission at the NTS.
Follicular lymphoma is an incurable malignancy, with transformation to an aggressive subtype representing a critical event during disease progression. Here we performed whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing on 10 follicular lymphoma-transformed follicular lymphoma pairs followed by deep sequencing of 28 genes in an extension cohort, and we report the key events and evolutionary processes governing tumor initiation and transformation. Tumor evolution occurred through either a 'rich' or 'sparse' ancestral common progenitor clone (CPC). We identified recurrent mutations in linker histone, JAK-STAT signaling, NF-κB signaling and B cell developmental genes. Longitudinal analyses identified early driver mutations in chromatin regulator genes (CREBBP, EZH2 and KMT2D (MLL2)), whereas mutations in EBF1 and regulators of NF-κB signaling (MYD88 and TNFAIP3) were gained at transformation. Collectively, this study provides new insights into the genetic basis of follicular lymphoma and the clonal dynamics of transformation and suggests that personalizing therapies to target key genetic alterations in the CPC represents an attractive therapeutic strategy.
Several studies have reported transient neurological symptoms after spinal anaesthesia with 5% lignocaine. In order to evaluate the role of concentrated solutions of local anaesthetic in the development of transient neurological symptoms, 200 ASA I or II patients undergoing minor orthopaedic or rectal surgery under spinal anaesthesia were allocated randomly to receive 4% mepivacaine 80 mg or hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine 10 mg. All patients were interviewed by an anaesthetist approximately 24 h after spinal anaesthesia, and after 1 week patients were asked to return a written questionnaire. The incidence of transient neurological symptoms consisting of pain in the buttocks or pain radiating symmetrically to the lower extremities differed (P < 0.001) between patients receiving mepivacaine (30%) and those receiving bupivacaine (3%). Hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine can be recommended for minor operations on the lower abdomen or lower extremities.
We report cardiac valvulopathy occurring after prolonged intake of anorectic drugs containing fenfluramine (Fen) and/or dexfenfluramine (D-Fen) in 14 patients whose evolution was followed by Doppler echocardiography. A relation between these drugs and valvular regurgitation was first suspected after 4 cases reported in 1991-1992 and confirmed after 3 more patients in 1993-94-95, who were taken D-Fen or Fen alone. All were women, aged 42 to 73 years. Patient 1 to 7 had been taking Fen and/or D-Fen for 14 to 52 months. Patients 8 to 14 had been taking a mixture of Fen and/or D-Fen, diethylpropion and chinese-herbs for 3 to 69 months. These last 7 patients developed renal failure requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in 5 and subsequent renal transplantation in 4. All presented with cardiac murmur(s) and some with dyspnea or palpitations. An initial echocardiography was performed at the time of diagnosis, and was repeated annually for a follow-up period extending to 8 years. We conclude that a relation between Fen and/or D-Fen and the outbreak of valvular heart disease is identified in our patients, confirming previous findings. The nephrotoxicity observed in 7 patients is due to the "chinese-herbs". When Fen and/or D-Fen are stopped and proper therapy initiated, the cardiac symptoms may stabilize or even subside, though slowly. Hemodynamic unstability and/or infection appear to be an aggravating factor. These patient's follow up must be prolonged for several years and is readily achieved with echocardiography. Systematic screening of all patients having taken Fen and/or D-Fen must be performed, as renal and urinary screening for all patients having taken chinese-herbs. Endocardial prophylaxis must always be prescribed.
Constitutional SMARCB1 mutations at 22q11.23 have been found in ∼50% of familial and <10% of sporadic schwannomatosis cases. We sequenced highly conserved regions along 22q from eight individuals with schwannomatosis whose schwannomas involved somatic loss of one copy of 22q, encompassing SMARCB1 and NF2, with a different somatic mutation of the other NF2 allele in every schwannoma but no mutation of the remaining SMARCB1 allele in blood and tumor samples. LZTR1 germline mutations were identified in seven of the eight cases. LZTR1 sequencing in 12 further cases with the same molecular signature identified 9 additional germline mutations. Loss of heterozygosity with retention of an LZTR1 mutation was present in all 25 schwannomas studied. Mutations segregated with disease in all available affected first-degree relatives, although four asymptomatic parents also carried an LZTR1 mutation. Our findings identify LZTR1 as a gene predisposing to an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of multiple schwannomas in ∼80% of 22q-related schwannomatosis cases lacking mutation in SMARCB1.
A receiver operating curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of the urinary cystatin C to urinary creatinine ratio for the renal monitoring of tenofovir. Urinary cystatin C to urinary creatinine ratio was measured in 37 samples from patients referred for suspected tenofovir-induced Fanconi syndrome. The best threshold (14 microg/mmol) was associated with sensitivity, 90.9%; specificity, 88.5%; positive predictive value, 76.9%; and negative predictive value, 95.8%. Urinary cystatin C to urinary creatinine ratio allows to rule out a Fanconi syndrome in most cases; thus, it should be used for the safety follow-up of nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor-treated patients.
To determine the effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist amantadine on levodopa-associated dyskinesias and motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD).
NMDA receptor blockade can ameliorate levodopa-induced dyskinesias in primates and PD patients. Amantadine, a well-tolerated and modestly effective antiparkinsonian agent, was recently found to possess NMDA antagonistic properties.
Eighteen patients with advanced PD participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. At the end of each 3-week treatment arm, parkinsonian and dyskinesia scores were obtained during a steady-state intravenous levodopa infusion. Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias were also documented with patient-kept diaries and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) interviews.
In the 14 patients completing this trial, amantadine reduced dyskinesia severity by 60% (p = 0.001) compared to placebo, without altering the antiparkinsonian effect of levodopa. Motor fluctuations occurring with patients' regular oral levodopa regimen also improved according to UPDRS and patient-kept diaries.
These findings suggest that amantadine given as adjuvant to levodopa can markedly improve motor response complications and support the view that hyperfunction of NMDA receptors contributes to the pathogenesis of levodopa-associated motor complications.
Paclitaxel-induced sensory neuropathy is a problematic side-effect of cancer chemotherapy. Previous studies in rodents have shown paclitaxel treatment to have many effects on different parts of the peripheral nervous system, but those responsible for its bothersome clinical side-effects are still unclear. In the current study, we sought to obtain information about the involvement of sensory neurons in paclitaxel neurotoxicity at the level of the dorsal root ganglion. Rats were treated with a clinically relevant dose of paclitaxel (87.5mg/m(2) weekly for a total of nine doses) to induce a sensory neuropathy; then their L5 dorsal root ganglia were studied by morphometry and immunohistochemistry. Paclitaxel treatment was generally well tolerated, and slowed conduction velocity and prolonged conduction latencies in the peripheral sensory nerves without altering conduction in the central or motor pathways of the H-reflex arc. In the L5 dorsal root ganglion, nucleolus size and the number of neurons with eccentric nuclei were increased only in a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglion neurons with cell body cross-sectional areas greater than 1750 microm(2), which made up less than 10% of the total population. Paclitaxel treatment increased immunohistochemical staining for activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3), c-Jun and neuropeptide Y (NPY) but only in a small percentage of neuronal cell bodies and mainly in those with large cell bodies. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that nucleolar enlargement, nuclear eccentricity, ATF-3, c-Jun and NPY are neuronal markers of paclitaxel-induced sensory neuropathy, however, these axotomy-like cell body reactions are infrequent and occur in mainly large-sized sensory neurons.
