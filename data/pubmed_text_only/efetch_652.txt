Azaribine used in high doses of 200 mg/kg a day is an effective agent in inducing temporary remissions in patients with severe psoriasis but potentially serious neurotoxicity may occur. Therapy should be initiated at lower doses of 125 mg/kg a day and advanced carefully only if clinical response does not ensue at the lower level.
The modifying effects of 6 naturally occurring antioxidants on 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB)-initiated rat prostate carcinogenesis were investigated in male F344 rats. Animals were pretreated with DMAB in a 20-week initiation protocol and then administered basal diet containing 0.8% catechol, 0.8% resorcinol, 0.8% hydroquinone, 2 ppm selenium, 2% gamma-orysanol or 1% alpha-tocopherol for 40 weeks. The experiment was terminated at week 60 for histopathological assessment of lesion development. Atypical hyperplasias and carcinomas of the prostate were observed in the ventral lobe in all groups treated with DMAB. However, the incidences of these lesions were not significantly different between carcinogen control and antioxidant-treated groups. There were also no significant increases or decreases in the incidences of tumors in any other organs.
The neuropsychological and behavioral status of children exposed to narcotics in utero was investigated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, the Bender-Gestalt, the Quick Neurological Screening Test, and the Burks Behavior Rating Scales. The narcotic-exposed children scored significantly lower than control children on Performance and Full-Scale IQs and most of the performance subtests. They scored significantly in the more pathological direction on Hand Skill, Figure Recognition and Reproduction, and Behavioral Irregularities. The narcotic-exposed children were significantly lower on the neurological indicators of the Bender-Gestalt. They scored significantly in the more pathological direction on almost all of the behavioral variables. The children exposed to methadone in utero scored in the more pathological direction than those exposed to heroin so as to raise questions directed toward the societal and ethical implications of methadone treatment.
An early event in the nephrotoxicity of haloalkene cysteine conjugates is their metabolism by cysteine conjugate beta-lyase to generate a reactive "thiol moiety" which binds to protein. This reactive metabolite(s) has been reported to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. We have examined the effect of three haloalkene cysteine conjugates on the activity of rat renal cortical cytosolic glutathione reductase and mitochondrial lipoyl dehydrogenase, two enzymes which have been reported to be inhibited by S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC) in the liver. N-Acetyl-S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3-butadienyl)-L- cysteine (N-acetyl PCBC) produced a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of glutathione reductase and kinetic studies showed that the inhibition was noncompetitive with a Ki of 215 microM. The enzyme activity from male rat kidney was more sensitive to N-acetyl PCBC than that from female rat kidney. Aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of cysteine conjugate beta-lyase, and bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, an amidase inhibitor, blocked the effect of N-acetyl PCBC on glutathione reductase, indicating that metabolism by the cytosol is required to produce enzyme inhibition. S-(1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine (TFEC) and DCVC are also noncompetitive inhibitors of glutathione reductase but are less active than N-acetyl PCBC with Ki's of 2.6 and 6.2 mM for DCVC and TFEC, respectively, DCVC produced a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of lipoyl dehydrogenase and kinetic studies showed that the inhibition was noncompetitive with a Ki of 762 microM. TFEC and PCBC also inhibit lipoyl dehydrogenase. Aminooxyacetic acid blocked the effect of DCVC, TFEC, and PCBC on lipoyl dehydrogenase, indicating that metabolism by the mitochondrial fraction is required to produce enzyme inhibition. Glutathione reductase activity in the renal cortex of male rats treated with 200 mg/kg hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCBD) was inhibited as early as 1 hour after dosing, before signs of marked morphological damage. The activity of lipoyl dehydrogenase was also reduced but was only statistically significant 8 hr after dosing when there was marked renal dysfunction. These findings indicate that the reactive thiol moiety formed by cysteine conjugate beta-lyase cleavage of PCBC can inhibit both glutathione reductase and lipoyl dehydrogenase activities in vivo following HCBD administration. We suggest that such inhibition is a general phenomenon, occurring with diverse and as yet unidentified renal proteins. The critical nature of mitochondrial function and the generation of reactive metabolites within this compartment make this organelle a prime target.
1. Four groups of rats received a liquid formula diet, given alone (control), or supplemented with either ethanol or phenobarbitone, or both together. 2. The ethanol-treated group showed a fall in plasma triglyceride and a rise in liver triglyceride, as compared with the control rats. 3. The phenobarbitone-treated group showed a marked rise in plasma triglyceride but not in liver triglyceride. 4. The group receiving both ethanol and phenobarbitone also showed a rise in plasma triglyceride, but this was accompanied by a striking increase in liver triglyceride. 5. These results suggest that ethanol and phenobarbitone each stimulate triglyceride synthesis but that in addition ethanol has an inhibitory effect on hepatic triglyceride secretion.
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) effectively induces clinical remission via apoptosis in relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, because this new anti-leukemic drug is also considered to be a poison, its possible adverse effects are a highly important issue related to its clinical use. We here investigated, both in vitro and in vivo, the effects of a combination of As2O3 and GM-CSF as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of APL. Treatment of both retinoic acid (RA)-sensitive and -resistant APL cell lines (NB4 and UF-1 cells, respectively), as well as primary APL cells with a combination of As2O3 and GM-CSF for 4 days resulted in inducing differentiation, but not apoptosis, to mature granulocytes. In addition, a combination of both agents induced degradation of the PML/RARalpha protein. GM-CSF was found to be associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 kinase in both NB4 and UF-1 cells, and a specific inhibitor of Jak2, AG490, completely blocked the ability of GM-CSF to prevent apoptosis and induce differentiation of As2O3-treated UF-1 cells. In in vivo analysis, As2O3 induced differentiation of APL cells in a RA-resistant APL model of human GM-CSF-producing transgenic SCID mice that had a high level of human GM-CSF in their sera. In contrast, As2O3 alone diminished tumors in UF-1 cells transplanted into NOD/SCID mice via induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, a combination of As2O3 and GM-CSF appears to be a novel differentiation-inducing therapy in patients with APL, including relapsed or RA-resistant cases.
Midodrine hydrochloride is a potent peripherally-acting alpha1 agonist that is well absorbed and rapidly metabolized to its active metabolite. It has been used for the treatment of refractory syncope but has the important side effect of supine hypertension. A 10-year-old boy with severe symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was treated with midodrine. After therapy, syncope attacks ceased but he suffered nighttime headaches, nausea, transient rash and itchy/prickly scalp. Midodrine was discontinued when supine hypertension was noticed. However, his supine hypertension continued until day 19 after discontinuation. This case shows that patients receiving midodrine should be observed for supine hypertension for a prolonged period.
To assess the effect of ribavirin-induced anemia on the outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
A retrospective observational study.
Two medical centers in Taiwan.
Forty-four patients with SARS who received ribavirin and 7 patients with SARS who did not receive ribavirin.
The mean peak C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in SARS patients who were receiving ribavirin therapy than in SARS patients who were not receiving ribavirin therapy. The mortality was also higher, but the difference was not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, hemoglobin level was an independent prognostic correlate of hypoxemia or mortality (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.8; p = 0.03). The hemoglobin began decreasing in two thirds of SARS patients (32 of 44 patients; 73%) who were receiving ribavirin 3 days after therapy with the antiviral drug was started. Patients with a drop in hemoglobin level of > 2 g/dL had a significantly higher mortality rate than the other patients. Hypoxemia developed in one third of SARS patients (17 of 44 patients; 39%) who were receiving ribavirin, all of whom were anemic. Of the 17 hypoxemic patients, 11 (65%) had a drop in hemoglobin of > 2 g/dL, and 4 patients (24%) required a blood transfusion. The mean slope of the hemoglobin decrease was significantly steeper (p = 0.001) in hypoxemic patients with SARS who were receiving ribavirin than in the nonhypoxemic patients with SARS who were receiving ribavirin. Only one of seven SARS patients (14%) who was not receiving ribavirin became anemic, but this individual was not hypoxemic. Eventually, 5 of 17 hypoxemic and anemic SARS patients (29%) who were receiving ribavirin died. The combination of hypoxia with anemia was thus significantly associated with a higher mortality (p < 0.001).
Hypoxia combined with anemia increased the risk for death in SARS patients. Unless ribavirin can be shown to be effective against SARS-coronavirus, the risk of anemia posed by this drug argues against its use in SARS patients.
Activity of plasma proteolytic systems was studied in outbred albino rats with acute renal failure. The possibility of treating this disorder with acute phase protein alpha-1-acid glycoprotein was evaluated. Acute renal failure was induced by single subcutaneous injection of mercury chloride (II). The parameters were evaluated on day 5 postinjection. alpha-1-Acid glycoprotein in a dose of 150 mg/kg was administered 3 times. Acute renal failure was accompanied by activation of the complement system and fibrin formation (with factors for the intrinsic and common pathways of blood coagulation) and inhibition of the fibrinolytic system and antithrombin activity. Treatment with glycoprotein was followed by partial recovery of fibrin formation and complement system. These changes were probably related to accumulation of glycoprotein in the renal tissue and in situ protective effect.
Microencephaly and microphthalmia in the embryos/fetuses from rats exposed to busulfan were histopathologically examined. Busulfan was intraperitoneally administered at 10 mg/kg on gestation days (Days) 12, 13 and 14, and then embryos/fetuses were harvested on Days 14.5, 15, 16 and 21. In the treated group on Day 21, all fetuses were small with reduced body weight, with microencephaly and microphthalmia. On Days 14.5, 15 and 16, apoptotic cells were increased in the neuroepithelium and the neural retina with a width reduction and a decrease in cell density, and the lens epithelial cells histopathologically. Mitotic inhibition was observed in the neuroepithelium, neural retina and equatorial zone of the lens. On Day 21, the cerebral cortex and the retina became markedly thinner. The lens fibers showed swollen, fragmentary and vacuolar formation in the cranial portion accompanied with small lens sizes. The anti-proliferative effects of busulfan brings about a lack of cell populations required for the normal organogenesis of the brain and eye, and leads to microencephaly and microphthalmia, featuring hypoplasia of cerebrum and hypoplasia of retina and lens with cataract, respectively.
A case of amphotericin B lipid complex induced fatal fat embolism is described. A 41-year-old Caucasian man with AIDS was undergoing treatment for cryptococcal meningitis with amphotericin B. His course was complicated by renal failure necessitating a change in therapy to amphotericin B lipid complex (Abelcet). At approximately 48 h, the patient developed tachycardia, tachypnea, respiratory failure, decline in hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, and alteration in mental status. Autopsy findings included fat emboli involving heart, lungs, kidney, and brain. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a fatal fat embolism caused by intravenous liposome drug delivery.
A history of oral contraceptive use, hormonal pregnancy tests, prescribed hormones and other drugs was obtained from 390 mothers of infants with congenital heart disease and 1254 mothers of normal infants in Massachusetts. The data show a small positive association between estrogen/progesterone exposure and cardiac malformation, the prevalence ratio estimate of exposed to non-exposed being 1.5 (90 per cent confidence limits are 1.0, 2.1). No association was evident, however, between hormones and trunco-conal or any other class of defect among the cases, an observation which casts doubt on a causal relationship betweem hormones and cardiovascular malformations. Several other drugs were reported more frequently by cases' mothers. These include: ampicillin; aspirin; a combined anti-nausea agent (doxylamine succinate, dicyclomine hydrochloride and pyridoxine hydrochloride); chlordiazopoxide, codeine, diazepam, diphenylhydantoin; insulin; phenobarbital; phenothiazine; phenylephrine; and tetracycline.
This study evaluated the effect of hormonal exposure before or during pregnancy on the risk of congenital heart disease to the child and assessed the cardiovascular teratogenicity of other drugs taken during early pregnancy. A total of 390 cases was ascertained from all infants with congenital heart disease born to Massachusetts women during the period of 1973-1975. 1254 randomly selected births were controls. A history of oral contraceptive (OC) use, hormonal pregnancy tests, prescribed hormones, and other drugs was obtained from both cases and controls. The proportion of mothers reporting any drug use during pregnancy was 54% for cases and 41% for controls. Among those reporting drugs, the mean number of drugs reported was 1.9 for cases and 1.8 for controls. Estimates of effects of specific drugs are provided tabularly. There was a small positive association with cardiac malformation for each of 3 categories of hormonal exposure (hormones prescribed during pregnancy, hormonal pregnancy tests, and OC use after conception). Combining the 3 types, the overall estimate for the rate ratio was 1.5; the overall exposure was compatible with no effect, the 90% confidence limit for the prevalence ratio ranging from 1-2.1. No association was evident between hormones and trunco-conal or any other class of defect among the cases, an observation which casts doubt on a causal relationship between hormones and cardiovascular malformations. Among the other drugs examined, insulin had the highest prevalence rate. Several other drugs were reported more frequently by mothers of cases, including: ampicillin, aspirin, a combined antinausea agent, chlordiazopoxide, codeine, diazepam, diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbital, phenothiazine, phenylephrine, and tetracycline.
Omeprazole is a non-competitive inhibitor of the parietal cell enzyme H+-K--adenosine triphosphatase. To date, two cases of angioedema and urticaria and two cases of anaphylaxis from omeprazole have been published.
To report a new patient with omeprazole-induced anaphylaxis demonstrated by skin tests and increased serum tryptase levels.
Elevated serum tryptase levels (5.1 U/L) were detected 6 hours after the onset of the anaphylaxis. Skin intradermal tests were positive with omeprazole i.v. (4 mg/mL), omeprazole capsules diluted in saline serum (20 mg/ mL), and lansoprazole (30 mg/mL). Serum specific IgE anti-omeprazole was negative.
According to the elevated serum tryptase levels and the positive skin test results, anaphylaxis was due to use of omeprazole. We think the adverse reaction to omeprazole was induced by an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity mechanism to omeprazole itself and not to a metabolite. We have also demonstrated crossreactivity, at least by skin tests, between omeprazole and lansoprazole.
Renal sodium retention is responsible for ascites and edema in nephrotic syndrome. In puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrosis, sodium retention originates in part from the collecting duct, and it is associated with increased Na,K-ATPase activity in the cortical collecting duct (CCD). The aims of this study were to evaluate whether the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) also participates to sodium retention and to determine the mechanisms responsible for stimulation of Na,K-ATPase in CCD. PAN nephrosis increased Na,K-ATPase activity in the CCD but not in OMCD. The two-fold increase of Na,K-ATPase activity in CCD was associated with two-fold increases in the number of alpha and beta Na,K-ATPase subunits mRNA determined by quantitative RT-PCR and of the total amount of Na,K-ATPase alpha subunits estimated by Western blotting. PAN nephrosis also increased two-fold the amount of Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit at the basolateral membrane of CCD principal cells, as determined by Western blotting after biotinylation and streptavidin precipitation and by immunofluorescence. The intracellular pool of latent Na,K-ATPase units also increased in size and was no longer recruitable by vasopressin and cAMP. This unresponsiveness of the intracellular pool of Na,K-ATPase to vasopressin was not the result of any alteration of the molecular and functional expression of the vasopressin V(2) receptor/adenylyl cyclase (AC) complex. It is concluded that PAN nephrosis (1) does not alter sodium reabsorption in OMCD, (2) is associated with increased synthesis and membrane expression of Na,K-ATPase in the CCD, and (3) alters the normal trafficking of intracellular Na,K-ATPase units to the basolateral membrane.
We report on the case of a 56-year-old woman with no psychiatric history who had a manic episode after taking a decongestant containing pseudoephedrine (a secondary or organic mania). The aetiology, differential diagnosis, treatment and risk factors for a manic episode are discussed. In addition, we review published articles on the subject of mania induced by pseudoephedrine.
p53 has been extensively studied in external genital carcinoma (EGC), and is frequently inactivated, but little is known about the role of the CDKN2A tumour suppressor gene in the oncogenesis of EGC.
To investigate the role of CDKN2A and p53 in the pathogenesis of EGCs and their precursor lesions vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN3), penile intraepithelial neoplasia and lichen sclerosus (LS).
By means of CDKN2A and p53 mutation screening (single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and sequencing), methylation analysis of alternative CDKN2A promoters (methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction) and p53 immununochemistry, we analysed eight invasive EGCs (five from vulva and three from penis) and 25 precancerous lesions (two undifferentiated VIN3 and 23 vulval/penile lesions of LS) from 33 patients.
p53 mutations (mainly transversions) and CDKN2A mutations (including one hot spot) were present in 75% and 50% of invasive tumours, respectively, but were absent in all precancerous lesions. Remarkably, all CDKN2A-mutated tumours also harboured a p53 mutation. CDKN2A or p53 mutations were observed more frequently in LS-derived EGCs than in human papillomavirus-derived EGCs (P = 0.053). A positive anti-p53 staining, but without p53 mutations, was also detected in 30% of LS lesions, suggesting a p53 stabilization in response to inflammation and carcinogenic insult. Methylation of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) promoters was not a frequent mechanism of CDKN2A inactivation.
Our study shows a high prevalence of co-inactivating mutations of p53 and/or CDKN2A genes in EGC, that seem to occur preferentially in LS-derived tumours and late in oncogenesis.
In a multicenter double-blind cross-over trial the therapeutic effect and the tolerance of d-2-(6'-methoxy-2'-naphthyl)-propionic acid (naproxen) and indometacin were compared including 46 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 35 patients with ankylosing spondylitis and 19 patients with osteoarthrosis. Duration of treatment with both drugs was two to four weeks each. The daily dose of naproxen was 750 mg, that of indometacin l50 mg. In rheumatoid arthritis the combined clinical effect of indometacin was stronger than that of naproxen while both drugs had the same clinical effectiveness in ankylosing spondylitis and osteoarthrosis. When differentiating the total clinical effect as to indices of pain, inflammation and function, indometacin was shown to be superior in all three diseases with regard to pain index. On the other hand, naproxen showed a better effect in ankylosing spondylitis and osteoarthrosis than indometacin as to inflammation, and as to function in osteoarthrosis.
To describe various aspects of prognostic and therapeutic importance in patients treated for acute chloroquine poisoning.
Retrospective study.
Toxicology intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital.
None.
One hundred sixty-seven consecutive patients with acute chloroquine overdose admitted to our toxicology ICU.
The mean amount ingested by history was 4.5 +2- 2.8 g. and 43 (26%) of 167 patients ingested > 5 g. The mean blood chloroquine concentration on admission was 20.5 +/- 13.4 mumol/L The majority (87%) of our patients received at least one arm of a combination therapy regimen (epinephrine, mechanical ventilation, diazepam). cardiac arrest occurred in 25 patients before hospital arrival; In seven of these patients, cardiac arrest occurred immediately after injection of thiopental. The mortality rate was 8.4% overall, and was 9.3% in patients with massive ingestions (NS vs. the group as a whole). We did not find a meaningful correlation between the amount ingested as estimated by history and the peak blood chloroquine concentration; the latter was highly correlated with the mortality rate.
The mortality rate in patients with acute chloroquine poisoning, including those patients sick enough to be referred to a specialty unit such as ours, can be limited to < or = 10%. This finding appears to be true even in patients with massive ingestions. We were not able to correlate mortality with amount ingested by history, although the mortality rate does correlate with blood chloroquine concentration. While early use of diazepam, epinephrine, and mechanical ventilation in most of our patients may have contributed to the excellent overall results, these elements, either singly or in combination, do not appear to have a truly antidotal effect in acute chloroquine poisoning. Thiopental, on the other hand, should be used with great caution, if at all, in such cases.
Experiments in cats anesthetized with alpha-chloralose showed that tizanidine (TZD: 5-chloro-4-(2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino)-2,1,3-benzothiodiazole) partly resembled carbamazepine (CBZ) and baclofen (BCF) in that it depressed excitatory transmission and facilitated segmental inhibition of neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus oralis which responded to tapping but did not affect the response of neurons which responded to light stroking of the skin or bending the whiskers. In a double-blind crossover study of TZD in refractory trigeminal neuralgia, 8 of 10 patients had fewer painful paroxysms while on TZD. However, the 6 patients who elected to continue taking TZD experienced a recurrence of their attacks of trigeminal neuralgia within 1-3 months. The limited efficacy of TZD in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia may be related to the fact that it has no effect on neuronal responses to low-threshold mechanoceptive stimuli, suggesting that low-threshold mechanoceptive neurons play an important role in the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia.
To determine the activity and toxicity of combination paclitaxel (24 hours) and carboplatin in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Eligibility required measurable disease (stage IV or stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, absolute neutrophil count > or = 2,000/microL, platelet count > or = 100,000/microL serum creatinine concentration < or = 1.5 mg/dL, and bilirubin level < or = 2 mg/dL. Paclitaxel was initially administered at a dose of 135 mg/m2/d, followed by carboplatin on day 2 at a targeted area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 7.5 using the Calvert formula. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously (SC) on days 3 to 17 was introduced during the second and subsequent cycles. In patients who sustained less than grade 4 myelosuppression, the paclitaxel dose was sequentially escalated 40 mg/m2 per cycle to a maximum of 215 mg/m2. Treatment was repeated at 3-week intervals for six cycles.
From June 1993 through February 1994, 54 patients were enrolled; 53 are assessable for toxicity and response. The median age was 62 years (range, 34 to 84). Sixty-nine percent were male, 65% had adenocarcinoma, and 93% had stage IV disease. Two hundred sixty-eight cycles were administered; 32 patients (59%) completed all six cycles. Twenty-five unanticipated hospitalizations occurred during treatment (9.3% of cycles) in 20 patients (37%). Myelosuppression was the principal toxicity; grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia occurred in 57% of patients after the first cycle, but decreased to 35% during the second cycle after introduction of G-CSF and consistently remained < or = 22% during subsequent cycles. Seven episodes of neutropenic fever occurred, all during the first cycle. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred in 47% and 33% of patients, respectively. Eight patients (15%) required platelet transfusions and 16 (30%) required packed RBC support. Neuropathy, myalgias/arthralgias, and thrombocytopenia, although generally mild, were cumulative. The paclitaxel dose was boosted to 215 mg/m2 in > or = 70% of patients who received three or more cycles. At an AUC of 7.5, the median first-cycle carboplatin dose was 424 mg/m2 (range, 273 to 709 mg/m2). The objective response rate was 62%, with five (9%) complete responses and 28 (53%) partial responses. The median progression-free survival time was 28 weeks and the median survival time 53 weeks. The 1-year survival rate is 54%.
The paclitaxel-carboplatin combination is active in advanced NSCLC and may enhance survival; it merits further investigation in phase III trials.
Methimazole is the most widely used antithyroid drug in Europe and North America, but it causes several undesirable side effects, such as hematological dysfunctions and immunosuppression. Our aim in this work was to compare, over a time course, markers of oxidative stress, the redox environment, the antioxidant enzymatic system, and the glutathione cycle in the spleen of rats with methimazole- or thyroidectomy-caused hypothyroidism. We used 70-male Wistar rats divided into four groups: 1) euthyroid; 2) sham thyroidectomy; 3) thyroidectomy-caused hypothyroidism, with parathyroid reimplant; and 4) methimazole-caused hypothyroidism. Five rats of the euthyroid- and methimazole-caused hypothyroidism groups were killed at the end of weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 after treatment, and 5 rats of the sham thyroidectomy and thyroidectomy-caused hypothyroidism groups were killed at the end of weeks 2, 4, and 8 after the surgical procedure. Each spleen was excised and stored at -70°C until oxidative stress, REDOX environment, and the antioxidant enzymatic-system markers were tested. The histological study showed that only methimazole-induced hypothyroidism caused cell damage. This damage was associated with an increase of oxidative-stress markers that were not compensated for by the antioxidant system. The increase of the glutathione-cycle enzymes was insufficient to prevent oxidative-stress markers. Methimazole causes oxidative stress and cell damage in the spleen, whereas hypothyroidism per se does not cause cell damage in this organ. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new antithyroid drugs without causing oxidative stress and cellular damage.
The multitargeted antifolate pemetrexed has demonstrated certain clinical activities against nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Resveratrol (3,5,4-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a polyphenol found in grapes and other plants and has great potential as a preventative and therapeutic agent due to its anticarcinogenic activity. The efficacy of adding resveratrol to pemetrexed to prolong the survival of patients with NSCLC still remains unclear. The excision repair cross-complementation 1 (ERCC1) is a DNA repair gene coding 5' endonuclease in nucleotide excision repair and is overexpressed in chemo- or radioresistant carcinomas. In this study, resveratrol (10-50 μM) inhibited cell survival in two NSCLC cells, H520 and H1975. Treatment with resveratrol increased ERCC1 messenger RNA and protein levels in a MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signal activation-dependent manner. Furthermore, blocking p38 MAPK activation by SB202190 or knocking down ERCC1 expression by transfection with small interfering RNA of ERCC1 enhanced the cytotoxicity of resveratrol. Combining resveratrol with pemetrexed resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect, accompanied with the reduction of phospho-p38 MAPK and ERCC1 protein levels, and a DNA repair capacity. Expression of constitutively active MKK6 (MKK6E) or HA-p38 MAPK vectors significantly rescued the decreased p38 MAPK activity, and restored ERCC1 protein levels and cell survival in resveratrol and pemetrexed cotreated NSCLC cells. In this study, for the first time, we have demonstrated the synergistic effect of combined treatment with resveratrol and pemetrexed in human NSCLC cells through downregulation of the MKK3/6-p38 MAPK-ERCC1 signal, suggesting a potential benefit of combining resveratrol and pemetrexed to treat lung cancer in the future.
The present study was carried out to test the effects of L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (L-alpha-GFC) on memory impairment induced by scopolamine in man. Thirty-two healthy young volunteers were randomly allocated to four different groups. They were given a ten day pretreatment with either L-alpha-GFC or placebo, p.o., and on the eleventh day either scopolamine or placebo, i.m. Before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after injection the subjects were given attention and mnemonic tests. The findings of this study indicate that the drug is able to antagonize impairment of attention and memory induced by scopolamine.
Oncocytic changes seen in hepatocytes in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are a result of mitochondrial damage. This is the first report that provides the electron microscopy illustration of mitochondrial proliferation as a result of the HAART drug Stavudine (Zerit) hepatotoxicity. The drug's effect on mitochondrial DNA replication leads to depleted mitochondrial-encoded proteins and configurational defects of the mitochondrial inner membrane leading to reduced and abnormal cristae, which house the electron transport chain and elementary bodies. This results in a decrease in the NAD/NADH ratio and reduces oxidative phosphorylation. The shift in the NAD/NADH ratio decreases the rate of fatty acid beta oxidation and oxidation of pyruvate by the Krebs cycle. Decreased oxidation of pyruvate drives it into an alternative pathway to form lactate leading to lactic acidosis. This mitochondrial dysfunction results in a compensatory increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, which results in oncocytic changes of the hepatocytes.
