Forty cancer patients were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 20). All had incapacitating pain unresponsive to the usual non opioid analgesic drugs. An epidural catheter was set up at the level of the most painful metamere, and made to pass subcutaneously so as to exit either in the supraclacicular fossa, or on the patient's flank. At T0, the patients were given 4 mg morphine hydrochloride diluted in 10 ml normal saline. Thirty min later, patients in the naloxone group (group N) were given a 0.4 mg bolus, followed by a constant rate infusion of 5 micrograms.kg-1.h-1, of naloxone hydrochloride during 18 h. Patients in group P (placebo) were given normal saline instead. The degree of pain was studied with a visual analogue scale and analgesia was assessed by a clinician on a five point scale. These two parameters were obtained half an hour after the injection of morphine and 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours later. At the same time, the patients were questioned about adverse side-effects: nausea, vomiting, pruritus, dysuria, urinary retention. Respiratory depression was assessed clinically and biologically (blood gas measurements at the afore mentioned times). Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also measured. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in quality and duration of analgesia. Pain reached its lowest level 4 h after the injection of morphine, returning to half its original value at the 24th h. This was also true for the incidence of nausea (11 in group N, 5 in group P), vomiting (3 in both groups), and urinary retention (6 in group P, 5 in group N).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The effect of Cavalheiro's pilocarpine model of epileptogenesis upon conditioned taste aversion (CTA), an important example of nondeclarative memory, was studied in adult Long Evans rats. Deterioration of CTA was studied during the silent period between pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and delayed spontaneous recurrent seizures. SE was elicited by i.p. injection of pilocarpine (320 mg/kg ) and interrupted after 2 hours by clonazepame (1 mg/kg i.p.). Peripheral cholinergic symptoms were suppressed by methylscopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.), administered together with pilocarpine. CTA was formed against the salty taste of isotonic LiCl. In the experiment of CTA acquisition, the CTA was formed and tested during the silent period after SE. In the experiment of CTA retrieval, the CTA was acquired before SE and the retrieval itself was tested during the silent period. Retrieval of CTA acquired before SE was impaired more than the retrieval of CTA formed during the silent period. Our findings indicate that epileptic seizures can disrupt even non-declarative memory but that CTA formed by the damaged brain can use its better preserved parts for memory trace formation. Ketamine (50 mg/kg i.p.) applied 2 min after the onset of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus protected memory deterioration.
Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and phenobarbital (PB) are cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A and CYP2B inducers, respectively, and have liver tumor-promoting effects in rats. In this study, we investigated the modifying effects on tumor promotion by I3C and PB co-administration. Six-week-old male F344 rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of N-diethylnitrosamine for initiation treatment. Two weeks after the initiation, rats were given no tumor-promoting agents (DEN alone), I3C (2,500 or 5,000 ppm in diet), PB (60 or 120 ppm in drinking water), or 2,500 ppm I3C + 60 ppm PB for 6 weeks. One week after the I3C/PB treatments, all animals underwent a two-thirds partial hepatectomy. The number and area of liver cell foci positive for glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P(+) foci) were not significantly fluctuated in the PB+I3C group in the isoadditive statistical model. On the contrary, the mRNA levels of Cyp2b1/2 and Nqo1 were suppressed and enhanced, respectively, in the PB+I3C group in the isoadditive model, but there was no enhancement in the microsomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels, and Ki-67(+) cell ratio in this group. The results suggest that the co-administration of I3C and PB causes no modifying effects in liver tumor promotion in rats.
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a heterogeneous disease with a pronounced variation in the clinical course. With the purpose of identifying genes that could be related to disease progression, we have performed gene expression profiling on B-CLL patients with an indolent disease and patients with a progressive disease with need for therapy.
we applied the Affymetrix GeneChip technique to 11 B-CLL patients with stable and 10 patients with clinically progressive disease. Supervised and unsupervised clustering methods with different algorithms were used to identify genes that tend to give a distinction between stable and progressive disease.
The supervised learning procedures identified groups of genes with a combined power to discriminate samples from progressive and stable disease with 70-90% accuracy. The gene for protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B' (B56) gamma isoform (PPP2R5C) and the gene for retinoblastoma-like 2 (p130) (RBL2) were included among the best discriminators; both genes were downregulated in progressive as compared to stable B-CLL. In a hierarchical clustering analysis based on gene expression pattern three clinical subcategories could be identified: one with a more severe clinical outcome, a second one with good prognosis, and a third one that was intermediate between the other two groups.
Our application of microarray analysis on a clinically well defined material has identified a number of genes with combined expression patterns related to stable or progressive disease in general. Unsupervised clustering suggested the existence of subclasses of samples in the progressive group that may be identifiable through gene expression patterns.
Transdermal therapeutic systems were developed using the polymers, Eudragit E 100 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone VA 64 in a film casting assembly. The medicated films were evaluated for physical properties, in vitro drug release studies, in vitro skin permeation studies, and pharmacodynamic studies.
The physical parameters were found to be very satisfactory with high drug content (>99%). The in vitro drug release studies were performed using paddle-over-disc assembly specified in USP XXIII. The pharmacodynamic studies were carried out using tail cuff method in Wistar albino rats. Hypertension was induced by methyl prednisolone acetate subcutaneously for 2 weeks. The developed matrix patch was found to decrease the blood pressure (25.42% reduction in mean systolic blood pressure of rats) significantly (P < 0.001) in proximity of the normal value and it was maintained for 24 hours.
It can be concluded that the developed transdermal matrix patch holds promise for the management of hypertension that needs to be validated by clinical trials.
In the present pilot-study, the relation between craving, obsessive thoughts about cocaine, experienced control, and attentional bias for cocaine related words is investigated. Sixteen cocaine abuse patients participated in a reaction time (RT) experiment which was employed to measure the ability of subjects to shift their attention away from cocaine related words. Postexperiment craving was found to be positively correlated with reaction times on drug related cues, in contrast to RT on neutral cues. Furthermore, obsessive thoughts about cocaine use and the experienced cocaine use control, in the week before the experiment, were correlated in a higher degree with RTs on drug cues than postexperiment craving. Attentional bias for drug cues was evidenced in patients with higher scores on obsessive cocaine thoughts and higher craving scores. This study shows that individual differences on information processing, within a cocaine abuse patient population, are present.
Since the introduction of the long-acting agents, bupivacaine in 1983 and etidocaine in 1985, to the dental local anesthetic armamentarium, their use has increased rapidly. Although an estimated one-half million local anesthetic injections are administered in the United States daily, the actual risks of toxicity from these local anesthetic injections remain unknown. Our review of the literature reveals numerous cases of severe adverse reactions associated with the administration of bupivacaine and etidocaine. This case review includes several fatalities, even after injection of only very small amounts of these long-acting local anesthetics. Results from animal studies have demonstrated increased systemic toxicity associated with bupivacaine and etidocaine as compared with lidocaine, the most extreme of which include severe central nervous system and cardiovascular reactions, eventually leading to hemodynamic instability, cardiovascular collapse, and death. Although many aspects of the side effect profile of bupivacaine and etidocaine are common to all local anesthetics, the physiochemical properties of the long-acting local anesthetics enhance their adverse effects. It is therefore imperative that the dental practitioner who uses these long-acting local anesthetics become familiar with the adverse reactions of these drugs.
Clinical observations have indicated that alcohol may be employed by cocaine/crack users to attenuate negative effects of cocaine, especially when "coming down" from a cocaine binge. This issue was examined by interviewing 66 dual cocaine/alcohol users, with opiate dependence histories, enrolled in methadone treatment. A path analysis model was specified to test several hypotheses concerning the possible modulating effects of alcohol use on cocaine use. About 60% of the subjects reported often employing alcohol to ameliorate discomfort associated with tapering or ceasing cocaine/crack use. The main findings were: (a) more intense cocaine/crack craving and feeling that cocaine/crack use was out of control both led to increased use of alcohol to come down; (b) the more frequently alcohol was used to come down, the less use of cocaine/crack; and (c) more cocaine/crack use and more use of alcohol to come down both led to increased heavy alcohol use. Thus, treating alcohol abuse in this population must take into account the important function it serves in modulating cocaine/crack use.
The effects of hypotension induced by trimetaphan (TMP) or nitroprusside (NTP) together with controlled haemorrhage on cerebral electrical activity, cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) and systemic circulatory and metabolic variables were measured in 10 mongrel dogs anaesthetized with halothane (end-tidal, 0.88 +/- 0.03%). Induced hypotension was maintained at cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) of 45 mmHg for 45 min and then at 30 mmHg for 45 min. In five TMP dogs, there were significant decreases in EEG-power and slowing of peak power frequency from the frontal area, but not from the occipital area. The CSFP did not change significantly except for an increase during the induction stage of hypotension. In five NTP dogs, there were no significant changes in EEG-power and peak power frequency throughout the study from either frontal or occipital areas, but CSFP increased significantly. With both drugs, an increase in glucose, lactate and lactate pyruvate ratio (L/P), and a decrease in PaO2 were more pronounced at 30 mmHg than 45 mmHg. With NTP, there were sustained increases in lactate and L/P, even after restoration of arterial pressure. The same magnitude and duration of the decrease in CPP induced by either TMP or NTP produced different effects on cerebral and systemic function.
Colchicine, a known microtubule disrupting agent, produces a human myopathy, characterized by accumulation of lysosomes. We have created a reliable animal model of colchicine myopathy that replicates the subacute myopathy seen in humans, reproducing the chronic proximal weakness and vacuolar changes in nonnecrotic myofibers. If a microtubule network plays a role in lysosomal function in muscle, disturbance of it could alter degradation of intrinsic membrane receptors, presumably at some intracellular processing site or at exocytosis. Thus, we examined, as a possible cellular pathogenesis of colchicine myopathy, how the muscle cytoskeleton affects the degradation of membrane proteins, which are processed through the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. We used the acetylcholine receptor as a model membrane component in cultured myotubes allowed to preincubate with colchicine. We tested at which step colchicine interferes with receptor trafficking by accounting for internalization, delivery to lysosomes, hydrolysis, or exocytotic release of debris. We report that colchicine significantly decreases the exocytosis of AChRs but does not affect receptor internalization, lysosomal hydrolysis, or the number of surface membrane receptors. Further, our immunofluorescence observations revealed a morphologic tubulin network in rat skeletal muscle that is more densely distributed in white (mitochondria-poor) muscle fibers than in red (mitochondria-rich) fibers but is present in both. Ultrastructurally, immunogold labeling localized tubulin in the intermyofibrillar region in a long and linear fashion, unassociated with myofibers or mitochondria. Taken together, our findings suggest the following: (1) Microtubules likely play a functional role in the pathway of lysosomal degradation in normal adult skeletal muscle; (2) The observed decrease in overall apparent degradation of membrane receptors by colchicine must be due primarily to inhibition of exocytosis. These data indicate that lysosomal "constipation" underlies colchicine myopathy. (3) An animal model faithful to the human disorder will allow further pathogenetic studies.
The present study examined the effects of prenatal morphine exposure on NMDA-dependent seizure susceptibility in the entorhinal cortex (EC), and on activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral and perforant path synapses in the hippocampus. During perfusion with Mg(2+)-free ACSF, an enhancement of epileptiform discharges was found in the EC of slices from prenatally morphine-exposed male rats. A submaximal tetanic stimulation (2x50 Hz/1 s) in control slices elicited LTP at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, but neither LTP nor LTD was evoked at the perforant path-DG synapses. In slices from prenatally morphine-exposed adult male rats, long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission was not observed at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, while the submaximal tetanus now elicited frank LTD of synaptic EPSPs at perforant path synapses. These data suggest that prenatal morphine exposure enhances the susceptibility of entorhinal cortex to the induction of epileptiform activity, but shifts long-term plasticity of hippocampal synapses in favor of LTD.
The authors report a case of a patient dying as a result of a myocardial infarction which was probably related to the administration of vinorelbine, the vinca alkaloid recently introduced into the treatment of non small cell bronchial cancers.
The consequences of two types of intravascular injections of lidocaine 1.5 to 15 mg/kg on three cardiorespiratory parameters were studied in 16 anesthetized rats. Administration of the local anesthetic via either the internal carotid artery (n = 8) or the external jugular vein (n = 8) caused hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory slowdown. Hypotension was significantly greater after external jugular injections; these were also associated with larger reductions in heart rate. Respiratory attenuation was generally similar for both routes, but high lidocaine doses (9 mg/kg) given via the external jugular were briefly the cause of significantly more respiratory depression. When given via the external jugular, lidocaine 15 mg/kg proved lethal in seven of nine instances. There were no lethal consequences when the same dose was administered via the internal carotid artery. These results offer no evidence in support of claims that the accidental retrograde flow of clinical doses of local anesthetics to the brain via the internal carotid artery can be the cause of hitherto unsuspected high levels of toxicity, leading to respiratory depression and even death.
Hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) has been shown to improve the survival of laboratory animals with experimentally induced acute liver failure and to ameliorate the physiologic abnormalities associated with liver-based metabolic deficiencies. However, the role of HTx in the treatment of liver cirrhosis (LC) has not been adequately studied. In order to address this issue, HTx was performed in rats following induction of stable LC using phenobarbital (PhB) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Intrasplenic transplantation of 50 x 10(6) primary hepatocytes could significantly improve liver functions and prolong the survival of rats with irreversible, decompensated LC.
Cyclophosphamide, which forms the nucleus for virtually all preparative regimens for autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), is an alkylating agent of which cytotoxicity is not directly caused by the parent compound but by its biologically active metabolites. Its nonmyelosuppressive toxicity in the ABMT setting is cardiomyopathy. We attempted to determine any correlation between plasma levels of total cyclophosphamide and the subsequent development of cardiac dysfunction.
Analyses of plasma levels and the derivation of plasma concentration-time curves (area under the curve [AUC]) were performed in 19 women with metastatic breast carcinoma, who received a continuous 96-hour infusion of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (CTCb) with ABMT. The assay for total cyclophosphamide measures the inactive parent compound; reliable assays of the active metabolites of cyclophosphamide are not yet available.
Six of 19 women developed moderate, but transient, congestive heart failure (CHF) as assessed by clinical and radiologic criteria. These patients had a significantly lower AUC of total cyclophosphamide (median, 2,888 mumol/L/h) than patients who did not develop CHF (median, 6,121 mumol/L/h) (P less than .002). Median duration of tumor response in these patients was also more durable; at least 22 months in patients with lower AUCs versus a median of 5.25 months in those with higher AUCs (P = .008).
These pharmacokinetic data support the premise that enhancement of cyclophosphamide activation may lead to both greater tumor cytotoxicity and increased but reversible end-organ toxicity. Early analysis of pharmacokinetic data may allow modulation of cyclophosphamide administration in an attempt to enhance therapeutic efficacy.
The cyclic peptide zyklophin {[N-benzylTyr(1),cyclo(D-Asp(5),Dap(8))-dynorphin A-(1-11)NH(2), Patkar KA, et al. (2005) J Med Chem 48: 4500-4503} is a selective peptide kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist that shows activity following systemic administration. Systemic (1-3 mg/kg s.c.) as well as central (0.3-3 nmol intracerebroventricular, i.c.v.) administration of this peptide dose-dependently antagonizes the antinociception induced by the selective KOR agonist U50,488 in C57BL/6J mice tested in the 55 degrees C warm water tail withdrawal assay. Zyklophin administration had no effect on morphine- or SNC-80-mediated antinociception, suggesting that zyklophin selectively antagonizes KOR in vivo. Additionally, the antagonism of antinociception induced by centrally (i.c.v.) administered U50,488 following peripheral administration of zyklophin strongly suggests that the peptide crosses the blood-brain barrier to antagonize KOR in the CNS. Most importantly, the antagonist activity of zyklophin (3 mg/kg s.c.) lasts less than 12 h, which contrasts sharply with the exceptionally long duration of antagonism reported for the established small-molecule selective KOR antagonists such as nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) that last weeks after a single administration. Systemically administered zyklophin (3 mg/kg s.c.) also prevented stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in a conditioned place preference assay. In conclusion, the peptide zyklophin is a KOR-selective antagonist that exhibits the desired shorter duration of action, and represents a significant advance in the development of KOR-selective antagonists.
Extracellular dopamine levels were determined by microdialysis in the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens and the frontal cortex of rats before and after an injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg, IP). After removal of the probes, these same animals were then tested for their voluntary intake of cocaine using the two-bottle, free-choice paradigm. Baseline dopamine levels and their responses to an injection of cocaine differed among the three brain areas. No significant correlations were found between baseline dopamine levels in any of the three brain regions and the voluntary cocaine consumption. A significant negative correlation was found between cocaine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine in the shell of the nucleus accumbens and the voluntary intake of cocaine (r = -0.73, p < 0.01). No such correlations were observed in the accumbens core region or the frontal cortex. These results provide further evidence of the role of the accumbal shell region in cocaine preference, and indicate that cocaine-induced increases in dopamine levels play a role in oral cocaine self-administration or preference. In addition, this relatively novel approach in using the same animals for both cocaine induced neurotransmitter responses and cocaine preference studies can also be applied for the study of other neurotransmitters and drugs of abuse.
In order to address data gaps identified by the NAS report Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children, a study was performed using methoxychlor (MXC). Female rats were gavaged with MXC at 0, 5, 50, or 150 mg/kg/day for the week before and the week after birth, whereupon the pups were directly dosed with MXC from postnatal day (pnd) 7. Some dams were killed pnd7 and milk and plasma were assayed for MXC and metabolites. For one cohort of juveniles, treatment stopped at pnd21; a modified functional observational battery was used to assess neurobehavioral changes. Other cohorts of juveniles were dosed until pnd42 and evaluated for changes to the immune system and for reproductive toxicity. Dose-dependent amounts of MXC and metabolites were present in milk and plasma of dams and pups. The high dose of MXC reduced litter size by approximately 17%. Ano-genital distance was unchanged, although vaginal opening was accelerated in all treated groups, and male prepuce separation was delayed at the middle and high doses by 8 and 34 days, respectively. In the neurobehavioral evaluation, high-dose males were more excitable, but other changes were inconsistent and insubstantial. A decrease in the antibody plaque-forming cell response was seen in males only. Adult estrous cyclicity was disrupted at 50 and 150 MXC, doses which also showed reduced rates of pregnancy and delivery. Uterine weights (corrected for pregnancy) were reduced in all treated pregnant females. High-dose males impregnated fewer untreated females; epididymal sperm count and testis weight were reduced at the high, or top two, doses, respectively. All groups of treated females showed uterine dysplasias and less mammary alveolar development; estrous levels of follicle stimulating hormone were lower in all treated groups, and estrus progesterone levels were lower at 50 and 150 MXC, attributed to fewer corpora lutea secondary to ovulation defects. These data collectively show that the primary adult effects of early exposure to MXC are reproductive, show that 5 mg/kg/day is not a NO(A)EL in rats with this exposure paradigm (based on changes in day of vaginal opening, pubertal ovary weights, adult uterine and seminal vesicle weights, and female hormone data) and imply that the sites of action are both central and peripheral.
Alcohol induces cellular stress and promotes cell death in immune cells. Molecular mechanisms by which ethanol impairs the function of immune cells are largely unknown. Autophagy is a degradation pathway, acting either as a pro-survival or pro-death mechanism activated during stress conditions. We examined whether ethanol influences autophagy in monocytic human U937, CD4 Jurkat, and MCF-7 cells.
Effects of ethanol during starvation-induced autophagy were investigated, treating cells with ethanol alone and in combination with activation of autophagy by rapamycin or inhibition by wortmannin. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death features such as the breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA fragmentation, and cell permeability were assessed using FACS analyses. Expression level of Beclin-1, LC3-II, Bcl-2, and the activation of caspase-3, and PARP-1 were determined using Western blot analyses. Influence of ethanol on formation of LC3-II complexes was assessed using fluorescence microscopy in MCF-7 cells stable transfected with a GFP-LC3-II-expression vector.
Ethanol down regulated autophagy proteins such as Beclin-1 and LC3-II. Apoptosis was enhanced as shown by breakdown of mitochondrial potential, up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP-1 and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Formation of LC3-II complexes was inhibited by ethanol in caspase-3 deficient MCF-7 cells. Stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin prevented ethanol-induced apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin aggravated ethanol-mediated necrotic cell death.
Inhibition of autophagy via ethanol enhances susceptibility to cell death.
The acute effect of insulin treatment on the earlier reported protective effect of streptozotocin diabetes against the cardiotoxic effect of high doses of isoproterenol (ISO) was investigated in rats. Thirty to 135 min after the injection of crystalline insulin, ISO was given subcutaneously and when ISO induced fibrosis in the myocardium was morphometrically analyzed 7 days later, a highly significant correlation (r = 0.83, 2 p = 0.006) to the slope of the fall in blood glucose after insulin treatment appeared. The myocardial content of catecholamines was estimated in these 8 day diabetic rats. The norepinephrine content was significantly increased while epinephrine remained unchanged. An enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity with a consequent down regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors could, therefore, explain this catecholamine resistance. The rapid reversion after insulin treatment excludes the possibility that streptozotocin in itself causes the ISO resistance and points towards a direct insulin effect on myocardial catecholamine sensitivity in diabetic rats. The phenomenon described might elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms behind toxic myocardial cell degeneration and may possibly have relevance for acute cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.
The new, long acting converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was given to 26 patients with moderate to severe heart failure. In 23 cases the mean systolic blood pressure fell from 120 (SD 22) to 108 (25) mm Hg without adverse effects. Profound hypotension with severe bradycardia and sweating, however, occurred in three patients, most pronounced two to four hours after the first dose. The haemodynamic and biochemical changes in these patients were similar to those seen in patients with severe symptomatic hypotension after the first dose of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, except that with enalapril the changes occurred later and were longer lasting. Evidence of myocardial damage and reversible renal failure was seen in one patient, and acute reversible deterioration in renal function occurred in one other. In patients with heart failure converting enzyme inhibitors should be administered initially under strict medical supervision with appropriate facilities available for dealing with occasional profound hypotension.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) expression in predicting the response to epirubicin and disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer patients enrolled in a single institution trial of primary anthracycline and tamoxifen therapy. CAIX expression was assessed in 183 patients with T2-4 N0-1 breast cancer enrolled in a randomized trial comparing four cycles of single agent epirubicin versus epirubicin+tamoxifen as primary systemic treatment. All patients received postoperatively four cycles of the four weekly i.v. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil regimen. Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive primary tumors received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. Pretreatment, p53 (P=0.007), c-erbB2 (P<0.01), and Ki67 (P=0.02) were directly associated with CAIX expression, while bcl2 (P<0.000) and ER (P=0.000) and progesterone receptor (PgR; P<0.01) were inversely correlated. In multivariate analysis, only high p53 and low bcl2 were independently associated with CAIX positivity. CAIX immunostaining was significantly associated with poor outcome for DFS (P<0.002) and overall survival (P=0.001). In multivariate analysis, a significant interaction was found between CAIX and markers of hormone sensitivity, bcl2 (P=0.01), ER (P=0.02), PgR (P=0.02), and lymph node involvement (P=0.04), in predicting DFS. Presently, there are few clinical markers of resistance to tamoxifen treatment in ER-positive tumors. CAIX expression in breast cancer patients shows a negative predictive role of treatment efficacy in ER-positive patients on the adjuvant tamoxifen after primary chemo-endocrine therapy. Studies investigating the effects of pH on tamoxifen uptake and the effects of therapy with CA inhibitors are planned.
Broken heart syndrome, otherwise known as takotsubo syndrome, is stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Clinical presentation mimics acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, but with characteristic left ventricular apical ballooning. The mechanism is linked to overstimulation of the sympathetic system from high circulating catecholamine levels. We report a 46-year-old Caucasian female whose treatment of status asthmaticus with ketamine and epinephrine precipitated this syndrome. She required hemodynamic support with an intra-aortic balloon pump and dobutamine infusion. Myocardial function improved dramatically with supportive treatment. Iatrogenically induced takotsubo syndrome with vasoactive agents should be suspected in acute left ventricular dysfunction without coronary artery disease.
NR5A2 is an orphan nuclear receptor involved in cholesterol metabolism and embryogenesis. The high level of expression of NR5A2 in the ovary and its involvement in the regulation of steroidogenic gene expression also suggest a role for this transcription factor in female reproductive function. In vivo evidence for a role for NR5A2 in fertility, however, is still lacking. In order to address this possibility, we used Nr5a2+/- mice to demonstrate that heterozygosity for a null mutation of Nr5a2 leads to a decreased fertility in females. Our results indicate that although Nr5a2+/- mice display normal follicular development, ovulation, and estrogen production, they exhibit altered luteal function. More specifically, we show that the reduced reproductive ability of Nr5a2+/- females arises from a reduction in circulating progesterone concentrations and can be rescued by exogenous progesterone supplementation. This study therefore provides the first in vivo evidence for a role of NR5A2 in reproductive function and steroidogenesis.
