Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is a pesticide synergist used with pyrethroids as a domestic insecticide, and it acts as a non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogen in rats and mice. To clarify whether oxidative stress is involved in the liver tumor-promoting effect of PBO in mice, male mice were subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy, followed by N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment, and given a diet containing 0.6% PBO for 25 weeks. The incidences of cytokeratin (CK) 8/18-positive foci, adenomas, and carcinomas significantly increased in the DEN + PBO group compared with the DEN-alone group. The PCNA-positive ratio significantly increased in non-tumor hepatocytes, CK8/18-positive foci and adenomas in the DEN + PBO group compared with the DEN-alone group. PBO increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in microsomes but did not change oxidative DNA damage as assessed by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). In real-time RT-PCR, PBO upregulated the expression of genes related to metabolism, such as Cytochrome P450 1a1, 2a5, and 2b10, and metabolic stress, such as Por and Nqo1, but downregulated Egfr and Ogg1. PBO also increased early response genes downstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), such as c-Myc that is induced by excessive ROS production, and G1/S transition-related genes, such as E2f1 and Ccnd1. Thus, PBO can generate ROS via the metabolic pathway without any induction of oxidative DNA damage, activate cell growth, increase c-Myc- and E2F1-related pathways, and act as a liver tumor promoter of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic and therapeutic enoxaparin in pregnancy.
Three-year prospective audit.
Tertiary level obstetric hospital.
Fifty-two women who received subcutaneous enoxaparin, either a prophylactic dose (40 mg daily) in 26 pregnancies or therapeutic dose (1 mg/kg twice daily) in 32 pregnancies.
Pregnant women treated with enoxaparin were prospectively entered into a register. Data were retrieved by case note review.
Pregnancy outcomes, treatment complications and anti-Xa levels.
In the prophylactic group there were no fetal losses, thromboembolic events or complications related to enoxaparin. In the therapeutic group there were four first trimester miscarriages, a termination and 27 live births. Therapeutic enoxaparin prevented further thromboembolism without complications. One woman was treated with intermediate dose enoxaparin when she presented at 5 weeks' gestation on warfarin and 7 weeks after a venous thromboembolism. She developed a recurrent pulmonary embolus 3 weeks later and was subsequently treated with therapeutic enoxaparin. In the therapeutic group the enoxaparin dose/kg correlated poorly with anti-Xa levels, and dose adjustments were made. Therapeutic mean (SD) trough and peak anti-Xa levels were 0.33 U/mL (0.14) and 0.86 U/mL (0.24) in the first trimester and 0.48 U/mL (0.19) and 0.84 U/mL (0.23) in the third trimester.
In the present series, prophylactic and therapeutic enoxaparin treatment during pregnancy was effective and safe. Studies are required to determine the optimal duration of treatment with therapeutic enoxaparin following venous thromboembolism in pregnancy and the clinical relevance of anti-Xa monitoring.
Epidemiological studies show that some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nonspecific inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We determined the impact of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on A beta levels, deposition, and metabolism in a mouse model (the Tg2576) of AD-like amyloidosis. To this end, mice were treated with indomethacin and nimesulide continuously from 8 months of age until they were 15 months old. At the end of the study, indomethacin significantly reduced A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) levels in both cortex and hippocampus. This decrease was coincidental with a significant reduction of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activity. By contrast, nimesulide had no effect on both A beta peptides and NF-kappa B. Consistently, mice receiving indomethacin, but no nimesulide, showed a significant reduction in the amyloid burden compared with placebo. Neither drug had an effect on plasma levels of A beta peptides or the A beta precursor protein metabolism. In vitro studies confirmed that genetic absence of this factor reduces the anti-amyloidogenic effect of indomethacin. These findings indicate that chronic administration of indomethacin by blocking the activation of the NF-kappa B significantly reduces the amyloid pathology in Tg2576 mice, and provide insights into the mechanisms by which this drug could slow progression of AD.
Retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1) is among the 20 genes identified in the critical region of Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), a genomic disorder with multiple congenital anomalies associated with a 3.7 Mb heterozygous deletion of 17p11.2. Heterozygous premature termination mutations in RAI1 have been identified recently in SMS patients without detectable deletions. To investigate Rai1 function, we generated a null allele in mice by gene targeting and simultaneously inserted a lacZ reporter gene into the Rai1 locus. X-gal staining of the Rai1(+/-) mice recapitulated the endogenous expression pattern of Rai1. The gene was predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells involved in organogenesis. Obesity and craniofacial abnormalities, which have been reported in SMS mouse models containing a heterozygous deletion of the syntenic SMS critical region, were observed in Rai1(+/-) mice. Thus, haploinsufficiency of Rai1 causes obesity and craniofacial abnormalities in mice. Interestingly, the penetrance of craniofacial anomalies is further reduced in Rai1(+/-) mice. Most homozygous mice died during gastrulation and organogenesis. The surviving Rai1(-/-) mice were growth retarded and displayed malformations in both the craniofacial and the axial skeleton. Using green fluorescence protein and GAL4 DNA binding domain fusions to Rai1, we showed that Rai1 is translocated to the nucleus and it has transactivation activity. Our data are consistent with Rai1 functioning as a transcriptional regulator, document that Rai1 haploinsufficiency is responsible for obesity and craniofacial phenotypes in mice with SMS deletions, and indicate Rai1 is important for embryonic and postnatal developments.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders which are characteristically comprised of impairments in social interaction, communication and restricted interests/behaviours. Several cell adhesion transmembrane leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins are highly expressed in the nervous system and are thought to be key regulators of its development. Here we present an association study analysing the roles of four promising candidate genes - LRRTM1 (2p), LRRTM3 (10q), LRRN1 (3p) and LRRN3 (7q) - in order to identify common genetic risk factors underlying ASDs.
In order to gain a better understanding of how the genetic variation within these four gene regions may influence susceptibility to ASDs, a family-based association study was undertaken in 661 families of European ancestry selected from four different ASD cohorts. In addition, a case-control study was undertaken across the four LRR genes, using logistic regression in probands with ASD of each population against 295 ECACC controls.
Significant results were found for LRRN3 and LRRTM3 (P < 0.005), using both single locus and haplotype approaches. These results were further supported by a case-control analysis, which also highlighted additional SNPs in LRRTM3.
Overall, our findings implicate the neuronal leucine-rich genes LRRN3 and LRRTM3 in ASD susceptibility.
A reaction scale was used to assess noncardiac adverse reactions exhibited by nuclear medicine outpatients receiving intravenous dipyridamole for pharmacological stress testing.
The study included 933 patients referred to 2 cardiac outpatient centers for assessment. All patients evaluated in this study were unable to perform treadmill stress testing and underwent pharmacological intravenous dipyridamole stress testing. Dual-isotope (201)Tl rest/(99m)Tc-sestamibi stress imaging was performed. An analysis of adverse reactions exhibited by patients given dipyridamole was tabulated.
Of the 933 patients, 520 (55.7%) demonstrated no adverse reaction to intravenous dipyridamole; 413 patients (44.3%) had adverse reactions of some type. Many of these patients had multiple types of reactions, and a total of 604 reactions were recorded. The most prevalent adverse reaction was headache (224 reactions; 37.1%), followed by chest pain (73 reactions; 12.1%), and nausea (67 reactions; 11.1%). A sex comparison revealed 271 of 454 male patients (59.7%) and 249 of 479 female patients (52%) demonstrated no adverse reaction to intravenous dipyridamole. An evaluation of the most prevalent adverse reaction (headache) demonstrated a significant difference between males (37.9%) and females (62.1%).
An adverse reaction scale characterizing common noncardiac side effects of dipyridamole in nuclear medicine cardiac patients demonstrated the most prevalent adverse reaction was headache. Analysis by sex revealed that significantly more females than males complained of headaches.
There is a substantial literature showing that the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen can block swelling-activated chloride channels, such as those in astrocytes. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that anatomic characteristics consistent with swelling may be measured within the optic nerve head (ONH) of tamoxifen users whose ONH appearance is considered within normal limits.
Indices of ONH topography were measured using the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II (HRT) for two populations of women ages 40-69 years: (1) subjects using tamoxifen (20 mg/day) as adjuvant therapy after successful primary treatment for breast cancer and (2) control subjects not using any hormonal medication. All subjects had excellent visual acuity (with 20/20 or better in the test eye), and all appeared to be free of eye disease, as based on conventional photographic assessment. The study design was cross-sectional. The various ONH indices were assessed as functions of the duration of tamoxifen use.
The optic cups of short-term tamoxifen users (<or=2 years) were significantly smaller in both the lateral and axial directions than the optic cups of the control subjects. Of the 27 short-term users, 23 had cup volumes smaller than the median value for the control subjects. The cup sizes of long-term users (> 2 years, <or=5 years) were not distinguishable from those of the control subjects. The presence of small cups among short-term users did not depend on subjects' medical histories prior to tamoxifen use. Disk margin indices were not related significantly to the duration of tamoxifen use.
Small cup sizes consistent with localized subclinical swelling are not rare among short-term tamoxifen users. Thus, small cups are not likely to be a manifestation of a cumulative-dose toxicity. Instead, they probably result from other causes, possibly involving the action of tamoxifen on estrogen receptors. Further investigation with longitudinal and interventional methodologies is needed to definitively interpret the results.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been established to be an effective agent for treating newly diagnosed and relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. Laboratory data suggest that ATO induces apoptosis of hematopoietic or several solid tumor cells. However, to date, its effect on lung carcinoma has not been fully explored. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ATO on human lung carcinoma PG cells in vitro. We found ATO significantly inhibited the proliferation of PG cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. ATO-induced apoptosis of PG cells was confirmed by the observance of typical morphological changes and detected by the analysis of flow cytometry (FCM). ATO significantly inhibited Bcl-2 and Pgp expression of PG cells by SABC immunohistochemistry and FCM analysis. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ATO induced apoptosis of PG cells and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Pgp expressions, and these data might provide some theoretical basis for its clinical use in treating lung carcinoma.
Twenty-nine patients with non-small cell lung cancer refractory to prior therapy were treated with either vindesine (VDS) alone (3 mg/m2 every week) or the combination of VDS plus cisplatin (DDP) (100 mg/m2 every 28 days). Serial blood and urine samples were collected to assess the pharmacokinetics of VDS and DDP. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and 27 were evaluable for response. No objective antitumor responses were observed. Peripheral neuropathy manifested by paresthesias, muscle weakness, and constipation were observed in 20 treated patients, and hematologic toxicity consisting of thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia occurred in 18 patients. The plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of VDS and DDP measured in this study indicate that VDS and DDP do not interfere with each other and that the pharmacokinetics in previously treated and untreated patients are similar. The antitumor responses and degree of toxicity observed in this trial compare unfavorably with previously reported VDS and VDS-DDP trials in previously untreated patients with this disease and suggest that prior exposure to chemotherapy might both decrease antitumor activity and enhance toxicity of these chemotherapeutic agents.
A 30 days therapeutical trial with trazodone has been performed in 47 patients suffering from different types of tremor. No significant improvement was detected in patients suffering from parkinsonian syndromes, multiple sclerosis, psycogenic tremor and hyperthyroidism. After the double-blind trial with trazodone, a significant improvement (p less than 0.025) was, instead, evident in 5 out of 6 patients with essential tremor, while the score did not change in the 3 patients with essential tremor who were treated with placebo.
We have recently shown that six of seven totally blind people (who had free-running circadian rhythms with periods longer than 24 h) could be entrained (synchronized) to a nightly dose of 10 mg melatonin. After treatment discontinuation and re-entrainment to the 10 mg dose, we further found in three of these subjects that the dose could be gradually reduced to 0.5 mg without loss of effect. The question then arose: can a de novo (starting) dose of 0.5 mg initially capture free-running rhythms? Following withdrawal of the stepped-down 0.5 mg dose and consequent release into a free-run, the same three individuals were given 0.5 mg of melatonin de novo. All entrained within a few weeks.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. Unresectable disease patients have median survival of few months. There is a substantial need for novel treatments for patients with advanced HCC.
To provide an update review of mechanism of hepatocarcinigenesis and systemic therapies for HCC and the relevant role of Sorafenib in patients with advanced disease.
A Medline search was performed to identify pertinent original research and review articles. Selected references in these articles were also evaluated.
Systemic chemotherapy for HCC has been quite ineffective. Preclinical studies demonstrated that Raf/MAPK-ERK kinase (MEK)/Extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has a role in HCC. HCC tumours are highly vascularized and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) augments HCC development and metastasis. Sorafenib blocks tumour cell proliferation by targeting Raf/MEK/ERK signalling and exerts an antiangiogenic effect by targeting VEGF receptors-2/3 and platelet derived growth factor receptor beta tyrosine kinases.
Currently available therapies are not effective for patients with advanced HCC. Sorafenib has demonstrated for the first time to prolong survival in patients with advanced HCC, and it is the new reference standard for systemic treatment in these patients.
To determine if transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) pretreatment protects hair cells from aminoglycoside induced injury by modifying their intracellular calcium concentration, we assayed hair cell calcium levels in organ of Corti explants both before and after aminoglycoside (i.e. neomycin, 10(-3) M) exposure either with or without growth factor pretreatment. After TGF alpha (500 ng/ml) treatment, the intracellular calcium level of hair cells showed a five-fold increase as compared to the levels observed in the hair cells of control cultures. After ototoxin exposure, calcium levels in hair cells of control explants showed an increase relative to their baseline levels, while in the presence of growth factors pretreatment, hair cells showed a relative reduction in calcium levels. Pretreatment of organ of Corti explants afforded significant protection of hair cell stereocilia bundle morphology from ototoxic damage when compared to explants exposed to ototoxin alone. This study correlates a rise in hair cell calcium levels with the otoprotection of hair cells by TGF alpha in organ of Corti explants.
From September 1984 to July 1985, 11 children from 6 months to 6 years of age were treated with a three-drug regimen (OC-HDP), including vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatinum 200 mg/m2 given as five dose-fractions over 5 days. Nine had resistant and two relapsed neuroblastoma. Nine children had previously been treated with cisplatinum at conventional doses; nine had not received cyclophosphamide and ten had not received vincristine. Nine of eleven patients had a good response to treatment; six are presently alive in continuous complete remission 11-23 months (median 13 months) after diagnosis. Toxicity was moderate: no child showed either severe myelotoxicity or clinical or laboratory evidence of nephrotoxicity. No child had clinically significant ototoxicity. In six children audiometry showed hearing loss for high frequencies after the third cycle of treatment. It is concluded that OC-HDP regimen could be considered as a first-line treatment for advanced neuroblastoma.
Since resveratrol (3,4',5 tri-hydroxystilbene), which has been shown to inhibit multistage carcinogenesis, is not a potent cytotoxic compound, several studies were undertaken to obtain synthetic analogues of resveratrol with potent activity. We previously reported that a resveratrol derivative HS-1793 exhibits stronger antitumor effects than resveratrol in several cancer cell types. The present study was undertaken to reveal precise mechanism by which HS-1793 induces cell death. The induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein (GRP)-78, and ER stress-specific XBP1 splicing were found in HT29 human colon carcinoma cells treated with resveratrol. Conversely, these manifestations were not observed in HT29 cells treated with HS-1793. Inhibition of caspase-4 activity by z-LEVD-fmk significantly reduced the induction of apoptosis by resveratrol but not by HS-1793. These findings suggest that HS-1793, contrary to resveratrol, does not induce ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, we observed that HS-1793 but not resveratrol decreased phosphorylated Akt level. We also demonstrated that HS-1793, compared to resveratrol, exerted more effective apoptosis inducing activity in Akt-activated cells. Taken together, the stronger antitumor activity of HS-1793 originates, at least in part, from its ability for Akt inactivation.
Soft tissue calcification has been reported following the intramuscular injection of calcium salts and the intravenous administration of calcium gluconate. The present case report describes a neonate in whom calcification of the superficial scalp veins developed following administration of calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate through a scalp vein needle.
Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) mimics many features of temporal lobe epilepsy and is a useful model to study neural changes that result from prolonged seizure activity. In this study, distribution of the anti-adhesive extracellular matrix protein SC1 was examined in the rat hippocampus following SE. Western blotting showed decreased levels of SC1 protein in the week following SE. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the decrease in overall SC1 protein levels was reflected by a reduction of SC1 signal in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Interestingly, levels of SC1 protein in neurons of the seizure-resistant CA2 sector of the hippocampus did not change throughout the seizure time course. However, at 1 day post-SE, a subset of neurons of the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and hilar regions, which are noted for extensive neuronal degeneration after SE, exhibited a transient increase in SC1 signal. Neurons exhibiting enhanced SC1 signal were not detected at 7 days post-SE. The cellular stress response was also examined. A prominent induction of heat-shock protein (Hsp70) and Hsp27 was detected following SE, while levels of constitutively expressed Hsp40, Hsp90, Hsp110, and Hsc70 showed little change at the time points examined. The subset of neurons that demonstrated a transient increase in SC1 colocalized with the cellular stress marker Hsp70, the degeneration marker Fluoro-Jade B, and the neuron activity marker activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Taken together, these findings suggest that SC1 may be a component of the 'matrix response' involved in remodeling events associated with neuronal degeneration following neural injury.
Ghrelin receptor has been shown to be expressed along the human gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies showed that ghrelin and a synthetic ghrelin receptor agonist improved weight gain and lean body mass retention in a rat model of cancer cachexia by acting on ghrelin receptor, that is, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). This study aims to explore the expression and the distribution of ghrelin receptor in human gastrointestinal tract cancers and to investigate the possible involvement of the ghrelin-GHS-R system in human digestive cancers. Surgical human digestive cancer specimens were obtained from various portions of the gastrointestinal tract from different patients. The expression of ghrelin receptor in these tissues was detected by tissue microarray technique. Our results showed that ghrelin receptor was expressed in cancers throughout the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the cytoplasm of mucosal layer cells. Its expression level possibly correlated with organ type, histological grade, tumor-nodes-metastases stage, and nutrition status (weight loss) of the patients. For the first time, we identified the distribution of ghrelin receptor in digestive system cancers. Our results implied that the ghrelin-GHS-R system might be involved in the pathoclinical profiles of digestive cancers.
Nasal snorting of cocaine crystals causes destruction of the septal and nasal mucosa, which eventually provides exposure of the septal cartilage and nasal bones. This exposure eventually leads to septal chrondritis and nasal bone osteomyelitis. As this process continues, the severe loss of cartilage and bone allows gradual to total collapse of the nose. Correction of this deformity is best achieved by supplying new lining; this is possible by turning nasolabial flaps into the nasal vestibule to replace the lost and released lining. Once this has been accomplished, costal cartilage grafts can be inserted along the bridge and alae to maintain the structural integrity of the reconstruction.
Diphenylhydantoin is a anticonvulsivant and antiarrhythmic drug. We reported a less frequent case of diphenylhydantoin associated acute hepatotoxicity in a 18-year old woman who immediately after child birth presented generalized tonic-clonic seizures secondary to arachnoid cyst in the left temporal-lobe. The patient developed a mononucleosis like coinciding with previous descriptions. Histological features observed in the liver biopsy specimen showed compatible changes with toxic acute liver failure (ALF). In the few cases published of ALF for Diphenylhydantoin is not specifically pointed out the absence of hepatic encephalopathy as it happened to our patient.
We report a case of acute renal insufficiency in a 77 year-old patient who took flurbiprofen as antiplatelet therapy. This is an important observation because it illustrates the potential risk of acute renal insufficiency, when using flurbiprofen before invasive medical examination or surgery in patients receiving long-term treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II inhibitors. This risk is probably underestimated in usual clinical practice.
In the present study, we investigated the anti-diabetic potential of fucosterol by evaluating the ability of this compound to inhibit rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR), human recombinant aldose reductase (HRAR), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and α-glucosidase. Fucosterol displayed moderate inhibitory activity against RLAR, HRAR, and PTP1B. However, it showed weak or no activity against AGE formation and α-glucosidase. In addition, our kinetic study revealed that fucosterol showed a mixed type inhibition against RLAR and HRAR, while it noncompetitively inhibited PTP1B. Since fucosterol inhibited aldose reductase (AR), it holds great promise for use in the treatment of diabetic complications. Therefore, we predicted the 3D structure of AR in rat and human using the Autodock program to simulate binding between AR and fucosterol and evaluate the binding site-directed inhibition of AR by fucosterol. Results of the docking simulations of fucosterol demonstrated negative binding energies (-8.2 kcal/mol for RLAR and -8.5 kcal/mol for HRAR), which indicated a higher affinity and tighter binding capacity of fucosterol for the active site of the enzyme. In particular, the hydrophobic ring system and the aliphatic side chain of fucosterol were found to be tightly bound in a specificity pocket through apolar amino acid residues on AR, while the anion binding site on AR interacts with the 3-hydroxyl group and the double bond on the side chain of fucosterol. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated the potential of using fucosterol for the management and treatment of diabetes and diabetes-associated complications.
To examine the relation between grade III-IV periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage (PVH/IVH) and antenatal exposure to tocolytic treatment in very low birthweight (VLBW) premature infants.
The study population consisted of 2794 infants from the Israel National VLBW Infant Database, of gestational age 24-32 weeks, who had a cranial ultrasound examination during the first 28 days of life. Infants of mothers with pregnancy induced hypertension or those exposed to more than one tocolytic drug were excluded. Of the 2794 infants, 2013 (72%) had not been exposed to tocolysis and 781 (28%) had been exposed to a single tocolytic agent. To evaluate the effect of tocolysis and confounding variables on grade III-IV PVH/IVH, the chi(2) test, univariate analysis, and a logistic regression model were used.
Of the 781 infants (28%) exposed to tocolysis, 341 (12.2%) were exposed to magnesium sulphate, 263 (9.4%) to ritodrine, and 177 (6.3%) to indomethacin. The overall incidence of grade III-IV PVH/IVH was 13.4%. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the following factors were related significantly and independently to grade III-IV PVH/IVH: no prenatal steroid treatment, low gestational age, one minute Apgar score 0-3, respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, mechanical ventilation, and pneumothorax. Infants exposed to ritodrine tocolysis (but not to the other tocolytic drugs) were at significantly lower risk of grade III-IV PVH/IVH after adjustment for other variables (odds ratio = 0.3; 95% confidence interval 0.2 to 0.6).
This study suggests that antenatal exposure of VLBW infants to ritodrine tocolysis, in contrast with tocolysis induced by magnesium sulphate or indomethacin, was associated with a lower incidence of grade III-IV PVH/IVH.
