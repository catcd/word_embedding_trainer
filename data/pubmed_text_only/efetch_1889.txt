Lorazepam, a new benzodiazepine, was compared with morphine for premedication. Ten patients received morphine 10 mg/70 kg i.m. and 10 received lorazepam 4 mg/70 kg i.m. Respiratory effects were assessed from the change in slope (S) and intercept (B) of the carbon dioxide response line, using a development of Read's rebreathing method. Morphine depressed S by 47% (P less than 0.01), but after lorazepam S increased by 27% (P less than 0.05), neither drug altering B significantly. In two volunteers lorazepam was assessed by both the rebreathing and the steady-state methods; after lorazepam S was smaller by the steady-state than by the rebreathing technique. The findings for lorazepam are consistent with the known effects of sleep on carbon dioxide sensitivity. Amnesia lasting 4-8 h occurred in all patients who received lorazepam so that pain and nausea during this period were not recalled, but no patient who received morphine experienced amnesia. We conclude that lorazepam merits further study, particularly where sedation without respiratory depression is needed, as in obstetrics, and where amnesia for uncomfortable procedures is required.
The clinical and neurodevelopmental features are presented of four children--two sibling pairs--who were exposed in utero to valproic acid. One of each pair of children presented for diagnosis and assessment of developmental delay; the other sibling was examined at a later date. Three of the children were globally developmentally delayed with marked speech disability, and had dysmorphic features consistent with fetal valproate syndrome. One also had features of infantile autism. The fourth child had some of the dysmorphic features connected with fetal valproate syndrome, but had normal intellect, with his verbal ability being significantly below his non-verbal ability. He currently attends a school for learning-disabled children.
The addition of antiproliferative agents, most recently mitomycin C, has improved the outcome of glaucoma filtering surgery in eyes with a high risk of surgical failure. We conducted the present study to determine whether adjunctive mitomycin C would increase the success rate of primary trabeculectomies in phakic eyes.
Thirty-three eyes of 33 consecutive patients with phakic primary open-angle glaucoma, who were predominantly black (24 black and nine white), who underwent primary trabeculectomy with adjunctive subconjunctival mitomycin C (0.5 mg/ml for three minutes) were compared with a demographically similar historical control group of 30 eyes of 30 consecutive patients (20 black and ten white) with phakic primary open-angle glaucoma, who had undergone primary trabeculectomy without an adjunctive antifibrotic agent.
Although the mean preoperative intraocular pressures were similar in both groups (29.0 +/- 6.4 mm Hg in the mitomycin C group and 29.5 +/- 10.0 mm Hg in the control group, P = .61), the mean postoperative intraocular pressure at each follow-up period was significantly lower in the mitomycin C group than in the control group (10.3 +/- 7.1 vs 14.5 +/- 5.1 mm Hg at six months, P = .02; 10.5 +/- 4.9 vs 14.5 +/- 4.4 mm Hg at 12 months, P = .01; and 10.0 +/- 3.1 vs 17.2 +/- 3.0 mm Hg at 18 months, P = .004, respectively). The mean number of postoperative medications was also significantly lower in the mitomycin C group (0.2 +/- 0.4 vs 1.1 +/- 1.4 medications at six months, P = .007; 0.3 +/- 0.4 vs 0.9 +/- 1.1 medications at 12 months, P = .04; and 0.3 +/- 0.5 vs 1.7 +/- 1.2 medications at 18 months, P = .01, respectively). However, the mitomycin C group had a significantly higher incidence of prolonged hypotony (intraocular pressure less than 6 mm Hg) compared with the control group (15% vs 0% at nine months, P = .05). Younger age was associated with a higher incidence of persistent hypotony.
Adjunctive subconjunctival mitomycin C (0.5 mg/ml for a three-minute exposure) in primary trabeculectomies of phakic eyes, while increasing the success rate by decreasing intraocular pressure and postoperative medications, is associated with a higher incidence of prolonged hypotony.
The effect of methylcobalamine (5.6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl-Co-methylcobamide, CH3-B12) and cyanocobalamine (5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyly-Co-cyanocobamide, CN-B12) on the growth of Walker's carcinosarcoma and longevity of white noninbred rats with implanted Zajdela ascites hepatoma was studied. The two agents exerted a similar effect. They 1) reduced the survival of rats with implanted Zajdela ascites hepatoma and Walker's carcinosarcoma; 2) did not increase the cell concentration in ascites; and 3) increased the total volume of ascites.
Neuroadaptations induced by high-dose cocaine treatment have been hypothesized to persist after the cessation of drug treatment and mediate the expression of sensitization and tolerance to cocaine. We looked for evidence of these neuroadaptations in rats receiving more modest behaviorally effective cocaine treatments. Rats were exposed to either a sensitizing regimen of seven once-daily injections of 15 mg/kg cocaine or a tolerance-producing regimen involving a continuous infusion of the same daily dose. We assessed enzyme activity levels of protein kinase A and adenylate cyclase, and protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, cdk5 and neurofilaments in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. Only protein kinase A activity levels were altered by cocaine treatment, but this alteration persisted for only 7 days, whereas a sensitized locomotor response was still evident at 21 days. Although behavioral tolerance to cocaine was seen the day after the termination of treatment, none of the molecular measures was altered on this or any other day. Thus, although increased protein kinase A activity can temporarily modulate sensitized responses to cocaine, alterations in total levels of the molecules assessed in our study do not correlate with the expression of sensitized or tolerant locomotor responses to cocaine.
Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) is a suppressor of TNF-α mediated apoptosis, and its expression is induced by NF-κB activation. TNFAIP8 expression is significantly increased in various cancer cell lines. A correlation between TNFAIP8 overexpression, cancer progression, and poor prognosis has been described in many reports of human solid cancers.
To clarify the functional and clinical significance of the cancer progression-related gene, TNFAIP8, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we used immunohistochemistry to demonstrate TNFAIP8 expression in ESCC. Next, TNFAIP8 expression was depleted by using siRNA to examine the function of TNFAIP8 in the proliferation and apoptosis induction of ESCC cell lines.
We detected correlations between TNFAIP8 expression and TNM stage (P < 0.001), tumor depth (P = 0.002), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.013), distant metastasis (P = 0.001), lymphatic invasion (P < 0.001), and venous invasion (P < 0.001) among the clinicopathological characteristics of ESCC patients, and high TNFAIP8 expression was found in poor survival. TNFAIP8 depletion was significantly associated with apoptosis induction after cisplatin administration and reduced proliferation.
Our results suggest that TNFAIP8 might be an effective therapeutic target for ESCC in the future.
In 1998, fortification of a large variety of cereal products with folic acid became mandatory in Canada. A multicentric study was carried out to assess the impact of this policy on the frequency of NTDs. The present analysis focused on spina bifida.
The study population included approximately 2 million livebirths, stillbirths, and terminations of pregnancies because of fetal anomalies among women residing in seven Canadian provinces, from 1993 to 2002. Spina bifida cases were divided according to the upper limit of the defect: upper (cranial, cervical, or thoracic) and lower (lumbar or sacral) defects. Based on published results of red blood cell folate tests, the study period was divided into prefortification, partial fortification, and full fortification periods.
A total of 1,286 spina bifida cases were identified: 51% livebirths, 3% stillbirths, and 46% terminations. Prevalence decreased from 0.86/1,000 in the prefortification to 0.40 in the full fortification period, while the proportion of upper defects decreased from 32% to 13%. Following fortification, regional variations in the prevalence and distribution of sites almost disappeared.
Results confirmed the etiologic heterogeneity of spina bifida and the more pronounced effect of folic acid in decreasing the risk of the more severe clinical presentations.
We investigated potential analgesics for chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic pain using rats treated with paclitaxel.
Drugs were tested in a repeated dosing paradigm (four daily injections). Topiramate was tested with a long-term treatment paradigm (12 days). A literature search was performed to summarize prior data.
Mechanical stimulation of the hind paw was used to assay antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects acutely and 24 hours after injection.
Amitriptyline produced significant analgesia, but this was not apparent until after the second injection. Baclofen produced significant effects, but the response varied erratically. Mexiletine and NMED-126 (a mixed N- and T-type calcium channel blocker) produced consistent, significant analgesia when tested acutely, but the pain relief did not persist at 24 hours postinjection. Oxcarbazepine had no effect at any time. Tramadol produced consistent, near-complete analgesia when tested acutely, but the analgesia did not persist to 24 hours postinjection. Topiramate produced significant effects that were first evident after 6-8 days of dosing.
The present data and data from the literature review suggest that there are several potential treatments for chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have little or no efficacy. Opioids have an effect, but probably only with high doses. At least some antidepressants are analgesic in these conditions. Some, but clearly not all, anticonvulsants and sodium channel blockers have efficacy. Tramadol is a particularly promising candidate. Topiramate, acetyl-L-carnitine, carbamazepine, and venlafaxine may have protective or restorative effects. Clinical trials of these candidates are needed to advance the treatment of chemotherapy-evoked pain.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States due, in large part, to the lack of early detection methods. Lung cancer arises from a complex series of genetic and epigenetic changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, are reversible with currently available pharmaceuticals and are early events in lung tumorigenesis detectable by non-invasive methods. In order to better understand how epigenetic changes contribute to lung cancer, and to identify new disease biomarkers, we combined pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, with genome-wide expression profiling. Of the more than 200 genes upregulated by these treatments, three of these, neuronatin, metallothionein 3 and cystatin E/M, were frequently hypermethylated and transcriptionally downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and tumors. Interestingly, four other genes, cylindromatosis, CD9, activating transcription factor 3 and oxytocin receptor, were dominantly regulated by histone deacetylation and were also frequently downregulated in lung tumors. The majority of these genes also suppressed NSCLC growth in culture when ectopically expressed. This study therefore reveals new putative NSCLC growth regulatory genes and epigenetic disease biomarkers that may enhance early detection strategies and serve as therapeutic targets.
We report on a series of patients with acute strabismus related to heroin and methadone intake or withdrawal, discuss possible mechanisms involved in this clinical picture and make recommendations for work-up and referral.
Retrospective study.
Five patients presented with acute esotropia within days of heroin withdrawal, and two patients developed exotropia related to heroin or methadone intake. Neurological work-up and neuroimaging was non-contributory in all four patients who were examined.
Acute esotropia with double vision is a disturbing side effect of heroin withdrawal, and, similarly, acute exotropia may be related to heroin intake. In the absence of focal neurological signs, further work-up is not mandatory. Referral to a specialised orthoptic service is beneficial in offering the patient symptomatic treatment and reassurance, thus supporting successful withdrawal therapy.
Anorectics (appetite-suppressant drugs) are frequently requested by patients. Their usage, however, can have serious, life-threatening side effects, such as pulmonary hypertension and valve defects. The association of anorexigen use with pulmonary hypertension was first detected at the end of the sixties. Back than, the incidence of pulmonary hypertension, diagnosed as primary, increased soon after an anorexigen, aminorex was introduced. After aminorex was recalled several years latter, the incidence of the disease returned to the usual low levels. A recent epidemiological study proved that a newer anorexigen, fenfluramine (or its stereoisomer, dexfenfluramine) considerably increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension. Currently, it is unclear how the anorectics contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension. One possibility may be the increase in plasma serotonin concentration. Serotonin is a pulmonary vasoconstrictor in many species. However, even if this mechanism plays any role in humans, it cannot completely explain the influence of anorectics on the pulmonary circulation. The anorectics cause membrane depolarization of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells by inhibiting potassium channel activity. The depolarization activates voltage-operated calcium channels, thus increasing intracellular calcium ion concentration, which is the well-known stimulus for vasoconstriction. The increase in vascular tension can be especially significant when there is a deficiency in mechanisms acting against vasoconstriction, such as endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO). Such pre-existing defects may be the reason why only a fraction of patients using anorectics actually develop pulmonary hypertension.
The objective is to investigate whether polymorphisms with putative influence on fluorouracil/oxaliplatin activity are associated with clinical outcomes of patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with first-line oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and fluorouracil palliative chemotherapy.
Consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled onto medical oncology units in Central Italy. Patients were required to have cytologically/histologically confirmed metastatic disease with at least one measurable lesion. Peripheral blood samples were used for genotyping 12 polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD), excision repair cross complementing group 1 (ERCC1), x-ray cross complementing group 1, x-ray cross complementing protein 3, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes. The primary end point of the study was to investigate the association between genotypes and progression-free survival (PFS).
In 166 patients, ERCC1-118 T/T, XPD-751 A/C, and XPD-751 C/C genotypes were independently associated with adverse PFS. The presence of two risk genotypes (ERCC1-118 T/T combined with either XPD-751 A/C or XPD-751 C/C) occurred in 50 patients (31%). This profiling showed an independent role for unfavorable PFS with a hazard ratio of 2.84% and 95% CI of 1.47 to 5.45 (P = .002). Neurotoxicity was significantly associated with GSTP1-105 A/G. Carriers of the GSTP1-105 G/G genotype were more prone to suffer from grade 3 neurotoxicity than carriers of GSTP1-105 A/G and GSTP1-105 A/A genotypes.
A pharmacogenetic approach may be an innovative strategy for optimizing palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. These findings deserve confirmation in additional prospective studies.
Efficacy of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer may be improved by tailoring it to individual chemosensitivity profiles. Identification of nonresponders before initiation of treatment may help to avoid side effects. In this study, primary pancreatic cancer cells were isolated from 18 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. Eight commonly used pancreatic cancer cell lines were used as controls. Ex vivo chemosensitivity for gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin-C, cisplatinum, oxaliplatinum, paclitaxel and a combination of gemcitabine with oxaliplatinum or mitomycin-C was determined using a cellular ATP-based tumour chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA). Quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine RNA expression levels of genes implicated in chemoresistance. Chemosensitivity towards cytotoxic agents was highly variable in primary pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic cancer cell lines. ATP-TCA results for gemcitabine correlated to the tissue expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1). Time to relapse in patients with gemcitabine-sensitive tumours was significantly higher than in patients with chemoresistant pancreatic cancers (P=0.01; 71 vs 269 days). Furthermore, time to relapse in gemcitabine-treated patients was related to hENT1 expression (P=0.0067). Thus, chemosensitivity testing using ATP-TCA in pancreatic cancer is feasible and correlated with time to relapse in gemcitabine-treated patients. This suggests that ATP-TCA testing could be used as a decision-making tool in the adjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder resulting in the combined deficiency of aldehyde oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and sulfite oxidase. We report a male infant with MoCo deficiency whose clinical findings consisted of microcephaly, intractable seizures soon after birth, feeding difficulties, and developmental delay. Sequencing of MOCS1, MOCS2, and GEPH genes, and single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping array analysis showed, to our knowledge, unusual inheritance of MoCo deficiency/maternal uniparental isodisomy for the first time in the literature. At 10 months of age, he now has microcephaly and developmental delay, and his seizures are controlled with phenobarbital, clonozepam, and vigabatrin therapy.
The wide variability of dystonic postures manifested in the clinical course of Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a complicated on-going issue. Several recently published reports of Pisa syndrome (PS) in parkinsonian patients on dopaminergic therapy have described a variable means of onset and clinical course of this truncal dystonia.
To describe PD patients with PS, with the aim of stressing the frequent iatrogenic origin and potential reversibility of this syndrome during the initial stages of its appearance.
Eight consecutive PD patients who developed a PS after modifications of antiparkinson therapy were studied. All patients underwent detailed clinical assessment, [(123)I]FP-CIT-SPECT being performed in three cases. Four patients were videotaped.
All patients developed PS within a variable time-span ranging from 15 days to 3 months after adjustment of treatment. Seven cases of PS were manifested following an increase and one a decrease of dopaminergic treatment. A marked reversal of dystonia was produced in the first seven patients by the withdrawal or dose decrease of dopaminergic PS priming drug, and in the eighth patient an increase of dopaminergic therapy was necessary.
In our opinion, the recognition of reversibility of PS during the initial stages of its appearance may be of considerable clinical importance. Indeed, it may facilitate the rapid withdrawal or reintroduction of dopaminergic treatment, thus avoiding an initial veering towards the subchronic variant and, subsequently into a chronic irreversible variant.
Methyl formate (MF) is a volatile solvent with several industrial applications. The acute airway effects of MF were evaluated in a mouse bioassay, allowing the assessment of sensory irritation of the upper airways, airflow limitation of the conducting airways and deep lung (pulmonary) irritation. MF was studied at vapour concentrations of 202-1,168 ppm. Sensory irritation was the only effect observed, which developed slowly over the 30-min exposure period. The potency at steady state was at least 10-fold higher than expected from a hypothetically similar, but non-reactive compound. Methyl formate may be hydrolysed in vivo to formic acid, a potent sensory irritant, and methanol, a low-potent sensory irritant. Hydrolysis may be catalysed by carboxyesterases, and therefore, the role of the esterases was studied using the esterase inhibitor tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP). TOCP pre-treatment reduced the irritation response of MF, suggesting that carboxyesterase-mediated hydrolysis plays a role in the irritative effect. However, even after administration of TOCP, MF was considerably more irritating than expected from a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. The slope of the concentration-effect relationship for formic acid was lower than that for the MF in the low-dose range, suggesting that different receptor activation mechanisms may occur, which may include an effect of MF itself, in addition to an effect of formic acid and potentially an effect from formaldehyde.
A case is reported of occupational exposure to diaminodiphenylmethane leading to acute photosensitivity. Avoidance of sun exposure with cloth has allowed continued employment while preventing further recurrences.
The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant medication varies from 1.9% to 92%. The majority of studies reporting incidences were not systematically conducted.
We interviewed 60 patients (22 men and 38 women, with anxiety and mood disorders) who were being treated with various antidepressants. We used a questionnaire focused on sexual side effects and other side effects.
The incidence of sexual dysfunction during antidepressant use in our study is 43.3%. The sexual dysfunction was not limited to any particular diagnostic group nor to any particular antidepressant. There was no significant correlation between sexual dysfunction and anticholinergic side effects. The incidence of painful orgasm with antidepressants was 18% among males in our study.
The relatively high incidence of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant treatment in this systematic study emphasizes the importance of a detailed inquiry about sexual side effects as this interferes with treatment compliance.
We present a case of wide-complex tachycardia occurring during coronary angiography in a patient with a dual chamber pacemaker. This rhythm recurred only during coronary injection of contrast and appeared to be ventricular tachycardia. However, subsequent examination revealed the development of fusion beats followed by fully paced ventricular beats during coronary injection, which only mimicked a potentially dangerous arrhythmia.
We have investigated the expression and regulation of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) in gastric cancer.
Clinical gastric adenocarcinoma samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR for protein and mRNA expression of 15-PGDH and for methylation status of 15-PGDH promoter. The effects of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and epigenetic mechanisms on 15-PGDH regulation were assessed in gastric cancer cell lines.
In a gastric cancer cell line with a very low 15-PGDH expression (TMK-1), the 15-PGDH promoter was methylated and treatment with a demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored 15-PGDH expression. In a cell line with a relatively high basal level of 15-PGDH (MKN-28), IL-1beta repressed expression of 15-PGDH mRNA and protein. This effect of IL-1beta was at least in part attributed to inhibition of 15-PGDH promoter activity. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of 15-PGDH resulted in strong increase of prostaglandin E(2) production in MKN-28 cells and increased cell growth of these cells by 31% in anchorage-independent conditions. In clinical gastric adenocarcinoma specimens, 15-PGDH mRNA levels were 5-fold lower in gastric cancer samples when compared with paired nonneoplastic tissues (n = 26) and 15-PGDH protein was lost in 65% of gastric adenocarcinomas (n = 210).
15-PGDH is down-regulated in gastric cancer, which could potentially lead to accelerated tumor progression. Importantly, our data indicate that a proinflammatory cytokine linked to gastric carcinogenesis, IL-1beta, suppresses 15-PGDH expression at least partially by inhibiting promoter activity of the 15-PGDH gene.
1. Plasma volumes and cardiovascular status were assessed in rats with a congenital deficiency in hypothalamic vasopressin (Brattleboro strain) and in the parent strain (Long Evans), in water-replete and water-deprived states. 2. Water-replete Brattleboro rats were not hypovolaemic; water deprivation (14 h in Brattleboro rats, 53 h in Long Evans rats) produced similar percentage reductions in plasma volumes in the two groups. 3. In the water-replete state, cardiovascular variables were similar in Long Evans and Brattleboro rats. Inhibition of ganglionic transmission (with pentolinium) or of the renin-angiotensin system (with captopril), separately, did not have a greater effect on blood pressure in Brattleboro rats than in Long Evans rats. Recovery from hypotension caused by pentolinium was characterized by large swings in blood pressure in both groups of rats. These pressor episodes were abolished by administration of captopril to Brattleboro rats. After administration of pentolinium and captopril to Long Evans rats there was a substantial, although intermittent, recovery in blood pressure that was abolished by an antagonist of the cardiovascular actions of vasopressin. 4. In the water-deprived state, blood pressures were similar in Long Evans and Brattleboro rats; both groups showed an elevation in diastolic blood pressure relative to the water-replete state. After administration of pentolinium, there was a more marked recovery in blood pressure than was seen in the water-replete state. Administration of captopril alone had a slightly greater effect on blood pressure in Long Evans rats in the water-deprived, compared with the water-replete, state. However, in the former condition, Brattleboro rats showed a profound and progressive hypotension in response to captopril, indicating an indispensable role for the renin-angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure in these animals during water deprivation. 5. Only when the renin-angiotensin system and neural activity were inhibited did vasopressin express its full, independent, pressor potential in Long Evans rats. However, evidence was obtained that vasopressin may exert important effects on cardiovascular regulation via neural mechanisms and through interactions with the renin-angiotensin system.
There has been a great deal of recent controversy regarding the risk of very late stent thrombosis with drug eluting stents, especially in the context of antiplatelet therapy cessation. We report a case of very late stent thrombosis of a bare metal stent initially implanted for treatment of a myocardial infarction. The patient presented thirteen years later with a recurrent myocardial infarction three days after discontinuing aspirin. Angiography demonstrated thrombotic occlusion and severe underlying restenosis of the stent. To our knowledge, this is the latest bare metal stent thrombosis described in the world medical literature.
In the current study we aimed to gain insight into epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk and progenitor compartment modulation during doxorubicin (DOX)-induced mucositis in mice. Intestinal segments were collected on various days after DOX treatment. DOX-induced damage at day 1-2 was characterized by increased epithelial proliferation and apoptosis and a decrease in the expression of epithelial differentiation markers. Concurrently, T-cell factor-4 (TCF4) levels increased and the epithelial differentiation enhancing factor, bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP4), decreased. During severe damage (day 3), BMP4 levels were significantly increased, which inversely correlated with epithelial proliferation. At the same time, the expression of the epithelial differentiation markers was increasing again. At day 7, BMP4 levels were down-regulated, while the levels of the epithelial differentiation markers and TCF4 were normalized again. These data suggest that in response to DOX-induced damage, BMP4 and TCF4 are modulated in such a way that homeostasis of the progenitor compartment is partly preserved.
Cigarette smoke is the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the major regulators of endothelial cell survival and is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Fibroblasts are a significant source of VEGF in the lungs; however the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on VEGF release by fibroblasts is not fully understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke-induced disturbed VEGF release by human lung fibroblasts is a potential pathogenic mechanism that could contribute to COPD. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared by modification of the methods of Carp and Janoff (American Review of Respiratory Disease, 1978). Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were exposed to different concentrations of CSE and for different durations. VEGF release into the media was measured using ELISA. TGF-β1 receptor (TβR1)/Smad3 as a potential pathway for CSE modulated VEGF release was also investigated using biochemical analyses and siRNA inhibition of Smad3 and siRNA and pharmacologic inhibition of TβR1. CSE induced VEGF release by HFL-1 in concentration and time dependent manner. This was confirmed in two additional types of primary human fetal lung fibroblasts. CSE induced Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HFL-1 cells. Silencing of Smad3 by siRNA not only eliminated the stimulatory effect of CSE on VEGF release but also inhibited baseline VEGF production. Suppression of TβR1 by the pharmacological inhibitor (SB431542) markedly reduced VEGF release by HFL-1 in response to CSE and this effect was confirmed by TβR1 siRNA. In contrast, nicotine inhibited VEGF release by HFL-1 in a dose and time dependent manner. Our findings indicate that CSE stimulates Smad3-mediated VEGF release by lung fibroblasts. Nicotine does not account for the CSE stimulation of VEGF in HFL-1. The ability of lung fibroblasts to produce VEGF may play a role in pathogenesis of cigarette smoke induced lung disease.
Preadipocyte cell lines present a cell model with which to understand the physiopathological mechanisms underlying lipodystrophy syndrome, a common complication observed in patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) that, in general, is associated with the use of protease inhibitors (PI) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of NRTI and of PI and NRTI combinations in this cell model.
The differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells was studied by monitoring the expression of specific genes in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of antiretroviral drugs. Messenger RNA (mRNA) was quantified by two reverse transcription-PCR-based methods.
In the presence of 2 microM saquinavir, 30 microM ritonavir or 1 microM zidovudine preadipocytes delayed their differentiation, whereas the use of 10 microM nelfinavir led to cell death. Indinavir (10 microM) promoted lipoprotein lipase expression whereas 1 microM lamivudine or 1 microM stavudine enhanced slightly the expression of the malic enzyme gene. However, the combination of indinavir, lamivudine and stavudine led to a large increase in both lipoprotein lipase and malic enzyme mRNA transcription whereas the combination of indinavir, lamivudine and zidovudine led to a 2.5-fold increase in the expression of the lipogenic malic enzyme gene. Similar potentiating effects of NRTI and PI were observed on the expression of the fatty acid synthase gene.
Our data suggest that, like PI (although to a lesser extent) NRTI interfere with the differentiation process of adipocytes. In addition, we demonstrate that the effects produced by combinations of NRTI and PI are different from those elicited by each drug separately. This point may be particularly relevant in understanding the physiopathological mechanisms underlying the lipodystrophic syndrome.
