48 patients with normal-renin essential hypertension were treated with prazosin alone or in combination with oxprenolol. 1 h after a single dose of 2 mg prazosin tachycardia and a decrease in blood pressure developed. Renin activity in the peripheral plasma (PRA) increased from 1.04 +/- 0.15 to 2.64 +/- 0.20 ng AgT/ml/h. A 3-day treatment with 2 mg t.i.d. prazosin of 11 patients caused no further decrease in blood pressure, while PRA returned to the baseline level. Treatment for 3 days with 2 mg prazosin t.i.d. and 40 mg oxprenolol t.i.d. of 37 patients further decreased blood pressure as well as PRA. The increase in PRA after a single dose of prazosin could be related to the enhanced sympathetic activity. The decreased PRA after prazosin + oxprenolol therapy may be one of the factors responsible for the greater antihypertensive response to the combined therapy.
Four cases of severe cholestasis attributed to anabolic/androgenic steroid usage are reported. These cases are reported because each was severely jaundiced (peak bilirubin level 62 mg/dl), developed advanced hepatic failure (Child's Class B) and was referred to a liver transplant center for consideration for liver transplantation. The hepatic dysfunction and cholestasis in each persisted for 3 months or more. Moreover, in two the hepatic dysfunction was complicated by the development of renal dysfunction and anemia requiring additional medical interventions. With prolonged medical therapy, each case recovered fully without transplantation. These cases are important because they demonstrate that drug-induced cholestasis can be prolonged, can mimic advanced liver disease, and can be associated with co-existent renal dysfunction.
We treated six patients with unilateral malignant astrocytomas with pulse doses of intra-arterial BCNU (200 mg/m2 initially, with escalating doses every 6-8 weeks) via transfemoral selective internal carotid catheterization. Four patients had had partial resections without prior radiation therapy and received no steroids. They had decreased tumor stain and surrounding edema after two to four cycles of chemotherapy. For one patient, results of the neurologic examination returned to normal, with total disappearance of her tumor as assessed by computerized tomographic scan. Objective tumor response continued for 7 months in three patients and for 3 months in one. In two of the four patients, chemotherapy was discontinued because of retinal toxicity and not because of treatment failure. Two patients had had partial resections and radiation therapy. One patient had stable disease for 4 months, and the second had progressive disease with gradual visual loss beginning in the infused eye 3 weeks after the second treatment. The catheterization procedure is safe; it was without immediate complication in 17 BCNU infusions. In summary, high-dose intra-arterial BCNU is well-tolerated and is an effective initial chemotherapeutic modality.
In a parallel-group, placebo-controlled, polysomnographic study with randomization, the possible occurrence of rebound insomnia was evaluated in 24 patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic insomnia and receiving either triazolam 0.5 mg, zolpidem 10 mg, or placebo. Treatment duration was 27 nights, followed by three placebo-controlled withdrawal nights. Both drugs showed significant efficacy compared to placebo during the active treatment period. A trend toward tolerance was noted in the triazolam group but not in the zolpidem one. The increase in total sleep time in the zolpidem group was accompanied by an increase in the number of sleep cycles. When active treatment was discontinued, clear rebound insomnia was present in the triazolam group while it was not possible to observe any rebound in the placebo and zolpidem groups. Subjective feelings of the patients, which were assessed by means of visual analog scales, correlated well with polysomnographic data. Our findings tend to indicate that, even after long-term treatment, zolpidem does not induce rebound insomnia or daytime anxiety.
Two patients developed catastrophic multicentric skin necrosis while receiving warfarin to treat venous thromboembolism complicated by immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Patient 1 developed skin necrosis involving the breasts, thighs, and face, as well as venous limb gangrene and bilateral hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands, resulting in death. The second patient developed bilateral mammary necrosis necessitating mastectomies, as well as skin necrosis involving the thigh. Neither patient had an identifiable hypercoagulable syndrome, other than HIT. HIT may represent a risk factor for the development of multicentric warfarin-induced skin necrosis (WISN).
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease. The degradation of extracellular matrix and cartilage pave way in understanding the molecular mechanisms in RA. Degradation of cartilage is a more complex event involving the local release of metallaoproteases and lysosomal enzymes that mediate inflammation in joints and in the synovial fluid in RA.
In the present study, the efficacy of a Siddha preparation named Kalpaamruthaa (KA) in ameliorating the disease process via markedly reducing the joint destruction was demonstrated in adjuvant induced arthritis rat model. KA consists of Semecarpus anacardium nut milk extract (SA), dried powder of Emblica officinalis fruit and honey.
Both SA and KA were administered at dose of 150 mg/kg b.wt. for 14 days after 14 days of adjuvant injection in rats. The activity of lysosomal enzymes, the level of collagen, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and its degradative products were analyzed in control and experimental animals.
The study revealed that KA exhibited a profound reduction (p<0.05) in the activities of lysosomal enzymes and thereby decreasing (p<0.05) the levels of GAGs and its fractions when compared to arthritis rats. The latter was confirmed by Safrannin O staining for GAGs in the interphalangeal joints of control and experimental animals. The effect of KA was found to be improved than SA and this might be due to the combined interactions of phytoconstituents present in KA.
Carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely used anticonvulsant, occasionally causes serious hematologic disorders. A 12-year-old boy was admitted because of a diffuse petechial rash and profound thrombocytopenia (10 x 10(9) platelets/l), after having been treated for epilepsy with CBZ for 12 days. Seven days following withdrawal of CBZ and initiation of prednisolone therapy, the platelet count recovered. In a subsequent challenge test with CBZ, platelet counts again decreased, and the levels of platelet-associated IgG and serum interleukin-6 increased. No antibodies against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or Ib were detected in plasma. We believe that this is the first reported occasion when CBZ-induced thrombocytopenia has been defined by a rechallenge test.
Even though oral contraceptives (OCs) with the new 3 progestins are the most widely prescribed OCs in the world, especially in Europe, they still are not available to US women. Gestodene's, desogestrel's, and norgestimate's effective daily dose are only 75 mcg, 150 mcg, and 250 mcg, respectively, while the daily dose of norethindrone in OCs used in the US ranges from 350-1000 mcg. The older progestins alter lipid metabolism, thus increasing cardiovascular disease risks. Some studies indicate that the new progestins induce fewer lipid metabolic changes than the older progestins. A 1988 study in West Germany suggests, however, that women who use gestodene may be at increased risk of thromboembolism. Yet, similar research in the UK and also in West Germany did not find this association. There has been concern for many years about OCs' ability to change glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. 5 studies show that OCs with desogestrel cause fewer such disturbances than those with levonorgestrel. 1 study also finds that OCs with gestodene do not alter glucose and insulin levels. On the other hand, 1 study suggests, that OCs with gestodene increase glucose and insulin levels over 6 months. European studies of the new progestins demonstrate their low 1-year method failure rates (gestodene, 0.07/100 users; desogestrel, 0.04/100 users; and norgestimate, [pregnancy rate] 0.25/100 users). Further, the 3 progestins result in a smaller proportion of women who have side effects (breakthrough bleeding or spotting, 3-9%, breast discomfort or headaches, 10-13%). Yet, researchers have not directly compared the effectiveness and acceptability of the 3 new progestins. A legal dispute between 2 pharmaceutical companies prevented the marketing of norgestimate in 1990. 1 company claims patent infringement. The US Food and Drug Administration is now evaluating gestodene and desogestrel. It probably will not approve gestodene until the question of apparent excess of thromboembolism is resolved.
I.V. lidocaine has been used to ameliorate tinnitus, but in general its effect has been limited. The longer acting local anaesthetic ropivacaine may be more effective.
A total of 19 randomized, double-blind, cross-over study patients suffering from chronic tinnitus were given a 30 min i.v. infusion of ropivacaine or lidocaine 1.5 mg kg(-1) at an interval of 2-3 months. The intensity of tinnitus was evaluated on tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) scale and on the visual analogue scale (VAS). Plasma ropivacaine and lidocaine concentrations were determined.
In both treatments, the infusion decreased the VAS score significantly. At the end of infusion, a > or =50% reduction in VAS score was observed in five patients by ropivacaine and in one patient by lidocaine, but this effect was sustained for 1 h only in three patients. However, the THI scores did not differ significantly within or between treatments. On the post-infusion day, three patients after ropivacaine and five after lidocaine treatment had > or =30% improvement in the THI score. Four weeks later, one patient after ropivacaine and two after lidocaine had a > or =30% reduction in the THI score. One patient developed seizures soon after ropivacaine infusion from which he recovered uneventfully. His plasma concentration of ropivacaine was 1817 ng ml(-1). The highest individual ropivacaine and lidocaine concentrations were 3483 and 1680 ng ml(-1), respectively.
Temporary clinically significant alleviation of tinnitus was observed only in a few individuals after both i.v. ropivacaine and lidocaine. The toxicity of ropivacaine limits its usefulness.
The objective of this study was to develop a predictive algorithm for the likelihood of red blood cell transfusion in women with ovarian cancer undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy.
Patients in this analysis came from two phase III studies conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group and Gynecologic Oncology Group of platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer patients, SWOG 8412 and SWOG 8501/GOG 104. The probability of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion was modeled as a function of stage of disease, age, weight, creatinine clearance, hemoglobin (Hb) prior to the start of therapy, the platinum agent administered (i.e., cisplatin vs carboplatin), and the route of drug administration (i.e., intravenous vs intraperitoneal).
Overall, 16% of patients developed at least grade 3 anemia (Hb < 8 g/dL) during primary chemotherapy, with 2% experiencing grade 4 anemia (Hb < 6.5 g/dL). PRBC transfusions were administered to 32% of patients. Factors that were determined to be predictive of PRBC transfusions were age and baseline Hb. In patients with bulky stage III or stage IV disease, the odds of transfusion increased by 66% for each 10-year increase in age and by 65% for each 1 g/dL decrease in baseline hemoglobin. Thus a patient aged 65 with a baseline Hb of 10.5 g/dL has approximately a 40% chance of transfusion.
Older ovarian cancer patients (>65 years) with low baseline Hb levels (<10.5) at initiation of platinum-based chemotherapy are likely to become more anemic during treatment and should be considered for prophylactic erythropoietin therapy as an alternative to transfusion.
The cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) has been implicated in the control of energy balance. To explore the pharmacological utility of CB1R inhibition for the treatment of obesity, we evaluated the efficacy of N-[(1S,2S)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(3-cyanophenyl)-1-methylpropyl]-2-methyl-2-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]oxy]propanamide (MK-0364) and determined the relationship between efficacy and brain CB1R occupancy in rodents. MK-0364 was shown to be a highly potent CB1R inverse agonist that inhibited the binding and functional activity of various agonists with a binding K(i) of 0.13 nM for the human CB1R in vitro. MK-0364 dose-dependently inhibited food intake and weight gain, with an acute minimum effective dose of 1 mg/kg in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats. CB1R mechanism-based effect was demonstrated for MK-0364 by its lack of efficacy in CB1R-deficient mice. Chronic treatment of DIO rats with MK-0364 dose-dependently led to significant weight loss with a minimum effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg (p.o.), or a plasma C(max) of 87 nM. Weight loss was accompanied by the loss of fat mass. Partial occupancy (30-40%) of brain CB1R by MK-0364 was sufficient to reduce body weight. The magnitude of weight loss was correlated with brain CB1R occupancy. The partial receptor occupancy requirement for efficacy was also consistent with the reduced food intake of the heterozygous mice carrying one disrupted allele of CB1R gene compared with the wild-type mice. These studies demonstrated that MK-0364 is a highly potent and selective CB1R inverse agonist and that it is orally active in rodent models of obesity.
The beneficial effects of telmisartan on Angiotensin (Ang)-II mediated oxidative stress and renal fibrosis in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic nephropathy (DN) were studied. Thirty mice were divided into normal (NG), STZ-induced diabetic (DG) and telmisartan-treated diabetic (TG) groups. Compared with NG mice, DG mice showed significant up-regulations of AT-1R, TGF-β1, p-p38MAPK, p-MAPKAPK-2, p-Akt, p47phox, p67phox, gp91phox protein and collagen-III and all of these were significantly reversed in TG mice. The down-regulated protein expression of Ang-(1-7) mas receptor, ACE-2, PPAR-γ and PGC-1α were observed in DG mice and a significant up-regulation effect of telmisartan has been seen in the TG mice. Furthermore, TG mice showed reduced expression of fibronectin, production of superoxide radical as well as renal hypertrophy and fibrosis when compared with DG mice. These findings suggest that Ang-II plays a significant role in DN and telmisartan would be beneficial in reducing oxidative stress and fibrosis in STZ-induced DN.
Clozapine and olanzapine have been shown to acutely stimulate consumption of a fat emulsion (Intralipid) by male Lister hooded rats. We initially investigated the extent of any sex difference in Intralipid hyperphagia associated with olanzapine treatment. We then examined the degree of Intralipid hyperphagia produced by a range of atypical antipsychotic drugs having different associations with human weight gain, and also determined their effects on cocaine-stimulated locomotor activity as a measure of functional dopamine antagonism in vivo. Olanzapine (0.1-1 mg/kg) stimulated Intralipid intake to an equal extent in male and female rats. Quetiapine (10 mg/kg) also stimulated Intralipid intake whereas ziprasidone (0.3-10 mg/kg) or risperidone (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) did not have this effect. All of the compounds, except quetiapine, reduced cocaine-stimulated locomotor activity but the relationship to the degree of Intralipid hyperphagia was variable. Since there was a positive relationship between Intralipid hyperphagia and the reported extent of human body weight gain, we conclude that Intralipid hyperphagia may have predictive value for this drug-associated side effect and is not related to the dopamine antagonist properties of these agents.
Many proteins necessary for sound transduction have been identified through positional cloning of genes that cause deafness. We report here that mutations of LRTOMT are associated with profound nonsyndromic hearing loss at the DFNB63 locus on human chromosome 11q13.3-q13.4. LRTOMT has two alternative reading frames and encodes two different proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2, detected by protein blot analyses. LRTOMT2 is a putative methyltransferase. During evolution, new transcripts can arise through partial or complete coalescence of genes. We provide evidence that in the primate lineage LRTOMT evolved from the fusion of two neighboring ancestral genes, which exist as separate genes (Lrrc51 and Tomt) in rodents.
The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg). Coenzyme Q10 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before cisplatin administration. Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin. Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration. Also, histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin-induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappaB, caspase-3 and p53 in renal tissue. It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice.
Two children, who had received chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cisplatin for disseminated chondrosarcoma and recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma, developed congestive heart failure following treatment with mitoxantrone (DHAD); the total doses of DHAD were 128 and 90 mg/m2, respectively. The patient with chondrosarcoma had relief of his cardiac symptoms with digitalis and furosemide. The patient with rhabdomyosarcoma, whose tumor responded following treatment with DHAD, died 2 weeks after development of congestive heart failure. For patients who have received prior treatment with potentially cardiotoxic agents, administration of DHAD should be followed by careful monitoring of cardiac function.
We carried out whole-genome homozygosity mapping, gene expression analysis and DNA sequencing in individuals with isolated mitochondrial ATP synthase deficiency and identified disease-causing mutations in TMEM70. Complementation of the cell lines of these individuals with wild-type TMEM70 restored biogenesis and metabolic function of the enzyme complex. Our results show that TMEM70 is involved in mitochondrial ATP synthase biogenesis in higher eukaryotes.
To evaluate the effect of rosiglitazone in a murine model of liver fibrosis induced by Schistosoma japonicum infection.
A total of 50 mice were randomly and averagely divided into groups A, B, C, D and E. The mice in group A served as normal controls, while those in the other four groups were infected with Schistosoma japonicum to induce the model of liver fibrosis. Besides, the mice in groups C, D and E were treated with praziquantel, rosiglitazone and praziquantel plus rosiglitazone, respectively. NF-kappaB binding activity and expression of PPAR gamma-mRNA were determined by Western blot assay and real-time quantitative PCR. Radioimmunonassay technique was used to detect the serum content changes of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Histological specimens were stained with HE. Expression of TGF-beta1, a-smooth muscle actin and type I and type III collagen was detected by immunohistochemistry and multimedia color pathographic analysis system.
Inflammation and fibrosis in the rosiglitazone plus praziquantel treatment group (group E) were lightest among the mice infected with Schistosoma (P < 0.05). To further explore the mechanism of rosiglitazone action, we found that rosiglitazone can significantly increase the expression of PPAR gamma [E: -18.212 +/- (-3.909) vs B: -27.315 +/- (-6.348) and C: -25.647 +/- (-5.694), P < 0.05], reduce the NF-kappaB binding activity (E: 88.89 +/- 19.34 vs B: 141.11 +/- 15.37, C: 112.89 +/- 20.17 and D: 108.89 +/- 20.47, P < 0.05), and lower the serum level of TNF-alpha (E: 1.613 +/- 0.420 ng/mL vs B: 2.892 +/- 0.587 ng/mL, C: 2.346 +/- 0.371 ng/mL and D: 2.160 +/- 0.395 ng/mL, P < 0.05) and IL-6 (E: 0.106 +/- 0.021 ng/mL vs B: 0.140 +/- 0.031 ng/mL and C: 0.137 +/- 0.027 ng/mL, P < 0.05) in mice with liver fibrosis. Rosiglitazone can also substantially reduce the hepatic expression of TGF-beta1, alpha-SMA type I and type III collagen in mice with liver fibrosis.
The activation of PPAR gamma by its ligand can retard liver fibrosis and suggest the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to Schistosoma japonicum infection.
Intermittent high dose administration of calcitriol or alfacalcidol is effective in suppressing secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic dialysis patients, however calcaemic action of these vitamin D derivatives is a major obstacle. 22-Oxacalcitriol (OCT) has been reported to have less calcaemic action than calcitriol, while preserving a comparable suppressive effect on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. This preliminary study was conducted to examine the effects of OCT on secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic dialysis patients. OCT was administrated intravenously immediately after every haemodialysis session three times a week for 12 weeks to three haemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. An initial dose of OCT of 5.5 micrograms/haemodialysis session was increased stepwise by 5.5 micrograms/haemodialysis up to 22 micrograms/haemodialysis according to the suppression of PTH and calcaemic action. OCT was discontinued for at least a week when serum calcium adjusted to albumin concentration measured just before haemodialysis exceeded 11.5 mg/dl. Marked reduction in plasma PTH, alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was observed in all three patients. Although the dose of OCT was increased to 22 micrograms/haemodialysis in one patient, the final dose of OCT remained 5.5 micrograms/haemodialysis in the other two patients because of hypercalcaemia. It is concluded that OCT is highly effective in suppressing PTH in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hypercalcaemia may be a major factor which limits the use of OCT, though it may occur with higher doses of OCT than those of calcitriol usually given to suppress PTH hypersecretion.
An evaluation of pesticide use data and breast cancer incidence rates in California Hispanic females was conducted via a regression analysis. The analysis used 1988-2000 data from the California Cancer Registry, the population-based cancer registry that monitors cancer incidence and mortality in California. It also used pesticide use data from 1970-1988 from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. California is the leading agricultural state in the United States, and more than a quarter of all pesticides in the United States are applied there. Hispanic (Latina) females are commonly employed in agricultural operations. The authors performed regression analysis of county-level specific pesticide use data (pounds of active ingredients applied) for two classes of pesticides, organochlorines and triazine herbicides, against the breast cancer incidence rates among Latinas, controlling for age, socioeconomic status, and fertility rates, using negative binomial regression models. A total of 23,513 Latinas were diagnosed with breast cancer in California during the years 1988-1999. Risk of breast cancer was positively and significantly associated with age and socioeconomic status, and inversely and significantly associated with fertility levels. With respect to pesticides, breast cancer was positively associated with pounds of the organochlorines methoxychlor (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] for highest quartile = 1.18; confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.35) and toxaphene (IRR = 1.16; CI = 1.01-1.34). No significant associations were found for the triazine herbicides atrazine and simazine.
Pemetrexed has emerged as one of the most active agents for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We conducted a phase II study to assess the efficacy and feasibility of integrating pemetrexed in a concurrent therapy plan for patients with stage III NSCLC.
Patients with stage III NSCLC with performance status 0 to 1, adequate organ function including pulmonary function, and V20 less than 40% were eligible. Patients were treated with cisplatin 75 mg/m² (first five patients 60 mg/m²) and pemetrexed 500 mg/m² every 21 days for three cycles with chest radiotherapy to 66 Gy. Patients then received three cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 21 days. Tumors were analyzed for Excision Repair Cross Complementation Group 1 and thymidylate synthase.
Patient characteristics (N = 28) were median age, 60; males, 68%; stage IIIB, 64%; and squamous cell, 43%. Twenty-four patients (86%) completed all three cycles of cisplatin/pemetrexed. Of the 24 patients eligible for docetaxel, 21 (87%) received it. Grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (39%), febrile neutropenia (14%), esophagitis (14%), and pneumonitis (4%). Median survival was 34 months, and 1-year survival was 66%. Survival was not significantly different in squamous and other histology patients. Tumor analysis in 16 patients showed that moderate/strong expression of thymidylate synthase was significantly associated with progression-free survival and overall survival.
Integrating pemetrexed in a concurrent therapy regimen for patients with stage III NSCLC is feasible and was associated with a median survival of 34 months.
In the pilocarpine model of chronic limbic seizures, vulnerability of GABAergic interneurons to excitotoxic damage has been reported in the hippocampal CA1 region. However, little is known about the specific types of interneurons that degenerate in this region. In order to characterize these interneurons, we performed quantitative analyses of the different populations of GABAergic neurons labeled for their peptide or calcium-binding protein content. Our data demonstrate that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the stratum oriens of CA1 in pilocarpine-treated rats involved two subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons: interneurons labeled for somatostatin only (O-LM and bistratified cells) and interneurons labeled for parvalbumin only (basket and axo-axonic cells). Stratum oriens interneurons labeled for somatostatin/calbindin or somatostatin/parvalbumin were preserved. The decrease in number of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-containing neurons was observed as early as 72 hours after the sustained seizures induced by pilocarpine injection. Many degenerating cell bodies in the stratum oriens and degenerating axon terminals in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare were observed at 1 and 2 weeks after injection. In addition, the synaptic coverage of the axon initial segment of CA1 pyramidal cells was significantly decreased in pilocarpine-treated animals. These results indicate that the loss of somatostatin-containing neurons corresponds preferentially to the degeneration of interneurons with an axon projecting to stratum lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM cells) and suggest that the death of these neurons is mainly responsible for the deficit of dendritic inhibition reported in this region. We demonstrate that the loss of parvalbumin-containing neurons corresponds to the death of axo-axonic cells, suggesting that perisomatic inhibition and mechanisms controlling action potential generation are also impaired in this model.
This study was done to evaluate the therapeutic effects of naltrexone on smoking behaviors and to measure the changing of brain substances for elucidating the mode of action by naltrexone. Twenty-five voluntarily participated healthy male smokers were randomly assigned to naltrexone group or placebo group for 2 weeks. In this study, naltrexone group showed significant reduction in daily cigarette consumption amount, the expiratory CO levels, brief questionnaire for smoking urge (B-QSU) score, and FTQ score. However, only 2 subjects in naltrexone group quitted smoking completely at 4th week. Plasma levels of pituitary hormones (ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin) and endogenous opioids (beta-endorphin and dynorphin A) were checked weekly before and after the 'provocation and smoking coupled' stimulus once in a week for 3 weeks. In naltrexone group, pituitary hormones showed upward tendencies even though only the prolactin had statistical significance. However, beta-endorphin and dynorphin A were not significantly different between the two groups. It was suggested that naltrexone made effects on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activity as well as smoking behavior. However, the meaning of these endocrinal changes by naltrexone is not conclusive, whether it is beneficial or aversive.
To accurately know the time-dependent changes of the lipid peroxidation and antioxidative status for elucidating the mechanism of neuropathy induced by allyl chloride (AC), the malondialdehyde (MDA), anti-reactive oxygen species (anti-ROS), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were investigated in cerebrum, spinal cord and sciatic nerve of rats after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks of AC administration. AC was administrated to Wistar rats by gavage at a single dosage of 200 mg/kg/per dose (three times per week). Rats were sacrificed after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks of treatment, and cerebrum, spinal cord, sciatic nerves were dissected, homogenized and used for the determination of lipid peroxidation and antioxidative status. The results showed that MDA in cerebrum (112.4%) and sciatic nerve (113.1%) significantly increased (P<0.05) on third week of AC treatment and at gait score of 2, and further changes of MDA were observed after 6, 9, 12 weeks and at gait score of 3, 4. While a decrease (P<0.05) in the activities of GSH, CAT, GPx and SOD after 6, 9, 12 weeks intoxication and at gait score of 2, 3, 4 were observed in cerebrum, spinal cord and sciatic nerve. Anti-ROS activities also decreased in all three nerve tissues after 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks intoxication and at gait score of 2, 3, 4. Thus, AC intoxication was associated with elevation of lipid peroxidation and reduction of antioxidative status, and the time-dependent changes of these indexes in Wistar rats nerve tissues occurred. Sciatic nerve was the main target tissue and MDA was most sensitive among all indexes. The changes of lipid peroxidation and antioxidative status might be related to the degradation of nerve fiber and served as one of mechanisms of toxic neuropathy induced by AC.
There is a demand for serum markers that can routinely assess the progression of liver cancer. DENA (diethylnitrosamine), a hepatocarcinogen, is commonly used in an experimental mouse model to induce liver cancer that closely mimics a subclass of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, blood monitoring of the progression of HCC in mouse model has not yet been achieved. In this report, we studied glycomics during the development of mouse HCC induced by DENA.
Mouse HCC was induced by DENA. Serum N-glycans were profiled using the sequencer assisted-Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis technique developed in our laboratory. Possible alteration in the transcription of genes relevant to the synthesis of the changed glycans was analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
In comparison with the control mice that received the same volume of saline, a tri-antennary glycan (peak 8) and a biantennary glycan (peak 4) in serum total glycans of DENA mice increased gradually but significantly during progression of liver cancer, whereas a core-fucosylated biantennary glycan (peak 6) decreased. Expression of alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase 8 (Fut8), which is responsible for core fucosylation, decreased in the liver of DENA mice compared with that of age-matched control mice. Likewise, the expression level of Mgat4a, which is responsible for tri-antennary, significantly increased in the liver of DENA mice (P<0.001).
The changes of N-glycan levels in the serum could be used as a biomarker to monitor the progress of HCC and to follow up the treatment of liver tumours in this DENA mouse model.
