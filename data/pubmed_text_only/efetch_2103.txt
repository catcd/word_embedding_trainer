The results of three experiments on the functional neuroteratogenicity of anticonvulsants in rats are presented. Two of the experiments have been reported previously and are reviewed here, while the third experiment is presented here for the first time. The first experiment examined prenatal phenytoin (200 mg/kg), trimethadione (250 mg/kg), and phenobarbital (80 mg/kg) for critical period effects by exposing separate groups of rats to the drugs or to vehicle on embryonic (E) days 7-10, 11-14, or 15-18. Phenytoin produced effects in the E11-14 offspring, but few effects in the E15-18 offspring, and almost no effects in the E7-10 offspring. Phenytoin's E11-14 effects in the offspring were increased pivoting, delayed swimming ontogeny, hyperactivity, impaired water maze learning, and impaired passive avoidance retention. The second experiment looked for phenytoin's long-term effects. Phenytoin-exposed offspring administered 200 mg/kg on E7-18 exhibited numerous postnatal dysfunctions, including water maze learning deficits that persisted to beyond 501 days of age. The learning deficits were neither increased nor decreased in severity at this age compared to those seen in littermates tested at 50 days of age. The third experiment assessed the role of manganese in counteracting phenytoin-induced postnatal dysfunction and the possible confounding effects of maternal undernutrition associated with the drug's administration. The typical pattern of phenytoin-induced behavioral effects was observed in rat offspring. The results demonstrated that undernutrition was not a confound, since pair-feeding and pair-watering controls did not diminish the phenytoin-induced dysfunction in the offspring. Also, administration of a manganese supplementation (200 ppm in the drinking water) during gestation did not significantly alter the pattern of phenytoin-induced postnatal effects.
Telavancin is a novel bactericidal lipoglycopeptide with multiple mechanisms of action against gram-positive pathogens. The aim of this study was to describe the dynamics of the antimicrobial effect of telavancin against two strains of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant) in an in vitro kinetic model with simulated human pharmacokinetics. Also, static experiments were performed to determine the rate and extent of killing by telavancin in the presence and absence of human albumin and human serum. Experiments in broth and in nutrient-depleted medium were performed to study the rate and extent of killing by telavancin of bacteria in different growth phases. In the in vitro kinetic model regrowth was noted at 24 h for both strains when exposed to initial concentrations below 5 mg/liter. There was a >3-log(10) killing at all concentrations from 0.5x MIC and above at 24 h both in broth and in the presence of 40-g/liter human albumin. In contrast to the methicillin-susceptible strain, the methicillin-resistant strain in 40-g/liter human albumin showed a regrowth at concentrations of 0.5x MIC and 1x MIC at 24 h. At all the other concentrations >3-log(10) killing was seen at 24 h. Concordant results were seen in 50% human serum. At a target area under the curve/MIC ratio of 50 (corresponding to the human dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight, administered intravenously), >3-log(10) killing was observed at 6 to 8 h. Unlike most antibiotics, telavancin was able to kill both strains in a nongrowing phase.
To investigate the efficacy and safety of intramuscular (IM) aripiprazole for the treatment of agitation in patients with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episodes. In total, 301 patients experiencing acute agitation were randomized to IM aripiprazole 9.75 mg per injection (n = 78), IM aripiprazole 15 mg per injection (n = 78), IM lorazepam 2 mg per injection (n = 70), or IM placebo (n = 75) in this double-blind multicenter study. Patients could receive up to 3 injections over 24 hours. Primary efficacy measure was mean change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component score from baseline at 2 hours after first injection. Mean improvements in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component score at 2 hours were significantly greater with IM aripiprazole (9.75 mg, -8.7; 15 mg, -8.7) and IM lorazepam (-9.6) versus IM placebo (-5.8; P <or= 0.001). For all other efficacy measures, all 3 active treatments showed significantly greater improvements over IM placebo at 2 hours (P < 0.05), with similar improvements across the active treatments. Significant differences over IM placebo were seen by 45 to 60 minutes for several efficacy parameters. Both IM aripiprazole doses were well tolerated; the safety profile was similar to oral aripiprazole. Oversedation (Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale score of 8 or 9) during 2 hours after first injection was less frequent with IM aripiprazole 9.75 mg (6.7%) and IM placebo (6.8%) versus IM aripiprazole 15 mg (17.3%) and IM lorazepam (19.1%). IM aripiprazole 9.75 and 15 mg are effective and well tolerated for acute agitation in bipolar disorder, although the low incidence of oversedation suggests a risk-benefit profile for IM aripiprazole 9.75 mg.
To evaluate the effect of dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, DDS) on biliary bile salt secretion, we administered the drug to male and female Wistar rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg body wt, twice a day, for 4 days. DDS decreased basal bile flow by about 20% in both male and female rats. In addition, basal biliary bile salt secretion was decreased by the drug in animals from both sexes (about 30% decrease). Bile salt maximum secretory rate, as evaluated by infusing tauroursodeoxycholate at stepwise-increasing rates, was not affected by DDS in either male or female rats, suggesting that the density of canalicular bile salt transporters is preserved. The size of the bile salt pool and the rate of de novo synthesis of bile salts, measured in bile salt-depleted animals, were decreased by about 33 and 35%, respectively; there was no difference in response between males and females. The ability of the ileum to reabsorb bile salts, as estimated by analysis of the expression of the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter and of sodium taurocholate transport activity in brush border membrane vesicles, was not affected by DDS in either males or females. Overall, our findings suggest that an impairment of de novo synthesis mediated by a direct inhibition of CYP3A metabolism, rather than a decreased intestinal reabsorption of bile salts, accounts for the decrease in bile salt pool size. The dissociation between alteration of bile secretory function and the oxidative stress induced by DDS, which is known to be relevant only in male rats, is discussed.
Over the last several years, Japan has been facing its third epidemic of methamphetamine abuse. Methamphetamine and MDMA are categorized as Amphetamine Type Stimulants (ATS), and abuse of these substances has become a worldwide problem. A nationwide mental hospital survey on substance-related psychiatric disorders in Japan has been conducted since 1987 to clarify the current situation of Japan's substance abuse and dependence. Recent surveys show that methamphetamine and organic solvents are the most common substances of abuse in hospital settings. Fifty-five percent of all the patients included in the latest study in 2002 had psychiatric disorders due to methamphetamine abuse. Forty-five percent of them were diagnosed as having a psychotic disorder, and twenty-five percent had psychotic episodes lasting over six months. According to the psychotic disorder criteria in ICD-10 (F1x.5), the duration of a psychotic episode must not exceed six months. If the criteria are strictly applied to the abusers, they should not be diagnosed as having a psychotic disorder due to methamphetamine use, but as having schizophrenia or some other delusional disorder. However, the study demonstrates that many psychiatrists in Japan recognize methamphetamine user patients with persistent episodes of psychosis as having psychosis due to the substance use. This may reflect differences of diagnostic viewpoint between operational criterion in English-speaking countries and clinical observation of Japanese psychiatrists. In other words, it may reflect the difference between the acute toxic model and chronic toxic model of substance-induced psychiatric disorders. Reconsidering this point further will be productive and interesting. The latest survey also indicated gender differences in psychiatric disorders related to substance use. It revealed that female patients were likely to have more severe dependence syndromes, co-morbid psychiatric disorders, and a history of traumatic life events. It suggests that the substance-related psychiatric problems in female patients are possibly more complex and harder to treat. Treatment programs that focus more on gender differences in these disorders should be developed.
Hepatitis C is a viral infection that can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. According to current recommendations, the treatment is based on the association of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Strict treatment criteria are available and apply for the 8,000 patients diagnosed every year in France. Ophthalmological side effects are numerous, unpredictable, and sometimes severe.
We report the case of a patient treated with an association of interferon and ribavirin for hepatitis C, who presented two periods of decreased visual acuity 4 years apart. Interferon-related toxic retinopathy was suggested for the first event, while optical neuropathy was diagnosed for the second.
Ocular complications of hepatitis C treatment with interferon and ribavirin are frequent but often benign. Our recommendations are periodic ophthalmological examinations, including visual acuity and fundus examination, before starting the treatment, at 3 months, and if necessary at 9 months.
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced hypertension in the rat is characterized by nitric oxide deficiency. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for the enzyme nitric oxide synthase and glucocorticoids have been reported to reduce cytokine-induced BH4 production. Accordingly we hypothesized that ACTH-induced hypertension would be reversed by BH4 supplementation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 33) were treated with BH4 in vehicle (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) or vehicle alone (5 mg/kg/day i.p. of ascorbic acid in 4 mM HCl) for 10 days. ACTH (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) or saline daily injection was started 2 days after BH4 or vehicle treatment and continued for 8 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail cuff method. Treatment with HCl, ascorbic acid or BH4 alone had no effect on SBP. In saline treated rats, neither BH4 nor its vehicle modified SBP. In ACTH treated rats, SBP was increased in both BH4 (from 128 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 4 mmHg, T0 to T10, P < 0.0005, one way ANOVA) and vehicle groups (from 127 +/- 3 to 158 +/- 7 mmHg, T0 to T10, P < 0.001, one way ANOVA). There was no significant difference in SBP between BH4 + ACTH treated and vehicle + ACTH treated rats. Thus, daily injection of BH4 (10 mg/kg i.p.) failed to prevent the development of ACTH-induced hypertension in rat.
Although disulfiram and naltrexone have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of alcoholism, no medications have been approved for individuals with alcohol dependence and comorbid psychiatric disorders. In particular, the effect of these medications on alcohol use outcomes and on specific psychiatric symptoms is still unknown in patients with the most common co-occurring disorder, major depression.
Two hundred fifty-four patients with a major Axis I psychiatric disorder and comorbid alcohol dependence were treated for 12 weeks in an outpatient medication study conducted at 3 Veterans Administration outpatient clinics. Randomization included (1) open randomization to disulfiram or no disulfiram, and (2) double-blind randomization to naltrexone or placebo. This resulted in 4 groups: (1) naltrexone alone, (2) placebo alone, (3) disulfiram and naltrexone, and (4) disulfiram and placebo. Primary outcomes were measures of alcohol use. Secondary outcomes included psychiatric symptoms assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, alcohol craving, gamma-glutamyltransferase levels, and adverse events.
One hundred thirty-nine subjects (54.7%) met the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for major depression. There was no relationship between the diagnosis of depression and medication treatment on alcohol use outcomes, psychiatric symptoms, or the reporting of side effects for these medications. There was a significant interaction between diagnosis, medication group, and craving, where subjects with depression on disulfram reported lower craving over time than subjects with depression on naltrexone.
The results suggest that disulfiram and naltrexone are safe pharmacotherapeutic agents for dually diagnosed individuals with depression for the treatment of alcohol use disorders.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO/As2O3) is a promising drug for patients with a relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); however, it frequently causes fatal arrhythmias. This study aims to investigate the various cellular and molecular mechanisms of adverse cardiac effects and the electrophysi-ological alterations caused by As2O3. We show the dose-dependent effect of ATO (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4 mum) on electrically driven cardiac action potential from the papillary muscle of the guinea pig. ATO causes a significant prolongation of action potential duration (APD) at various levels of repolarization, conduction delay, and increased triangulation, which is a novel marker for the proarrhythmic potential of a compound. Electrolyte imbalance (hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia) has also been found to cause amplification of ATO toxicity. Since ion channels play a very important role in the generation of cardiac action potential, we used various ion channel modulators such as choline, minoxidil, nifedipine, and verapamil to determine whether these agents could antagonize electrophysiological alterations caused by ATO. In in vivo experiments, ATO administration to animals for 10 days caused myocardial disorganization, interstitial edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the heart. Efforts were also made to screen the efficacy of vitamin C against ATO toxicity. ATO also caused a significant increase in the activity of certain clinically relevant enzymes for cardiac function and antioxidant mechanismssuch as serum creatine kinase isoenzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione. In conclusion, ATO causes significant adverse cardiac effects and we suggest that cardiac function to be monitored during treatment with ATO. Our results also indicate that the status of the body's main electrolyte content (such as magnesium and potassium) is also an influencing factor on the magnitude of toxicity of arsenic trioxide.
The objective of this study was to assess whether treatment with sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin-SR) produces alterations in electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep that are associated with clinical response to the drug. EEG sleep was measured in 20 patients with unipolar major depressive disorder before and after treatment with sustained-release bupropion. Each EEG sleep session consisted of two consecutive nights. Treatment with bupropion lasted for 8 wk. Compared to EEG sleep measures at baseline, treatment with bupropion significantly lengthened REM latency, increased REM activity and density during the first REM period, and increased total REM density. Differential response to treatment was associated with changes in REM activity and density, but not with REM latency. However, in contrast to many other antidepressants, REM sleep was not suppressed.
Progranulin (GRN) haploinsufficiency is a frequent cause of familial frontotemporal dementia, a currently untreatable progressive neurodegenerative disease. By chemical library screening, we identified suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a Food and Drug Administration-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor, as an enhancer of GRN expression. SAHA dose-dependently increased GRN mRNA and protein levels in cultured cells and restored near-normal GRN expression in haploinsufficient cells from human subjects. Although elevation of secreted progranulin levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism has recently been reported, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a small molecule enhancer of progranulin transcription. SAHA has demonstrated therapeutic potential in other neurodegenerative diseases and thus holds promise as a first generation drug for the prevention and treatment of frontotemporal dementia.
A five-year-old, normally developed boy who had been healthy except for an absence epilepsy prior to valproate (VPA) treatment died 16 weeks after the introduction of VPA-monotherapy due to liver failure and intractable bleeding disorder. This case emphasizes that the restriction of VPA-therapy to children of more than two years of age, on monotherapy, and without evidence of other diseases or retardation does not exclude fatal complications. Until today world-wide about 100 patients have died during VPA-treatment.
Outdoor carbon monoxide comes mainly from vehicular emissions, and high concentrations occur in areas with heavy traffic congestion. CO binds to hemoglobin, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), and reduces oxygen delivery. We investigated the link between the adverse effects of CO on the respiratory system using COHb as a marker for chronic CO exposure. We examined the relationship between acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and COHb concentrations in school-age children living in urban and suburban areas of Quito, Ecuador. We selected three schools located in areas with different traffic intensities and enrolled 960 children. To adjust for potential confounders we conducted a detailed survey. In a random subsample of 295 children, we determined that average COHb concentrations were significantly higher in children attending schools in areas with high and moderate traffic, compared with the low-traffic area. The percentage of children with COHb concentrations above the safe level of 2.5% were 1, 43, and 92% in low-, moderate-, and high-traffic areas, respectively. Children with COHb above the safe level are 3.25 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.65-6.38] times more likely to have ARI than children with COHb < 2.5%. Furthermore, with each percent increase in COHb above the safety level, children are 1.15 (95% CI, 1.03-1.28) times more likely to have an additional case of ARI. Our findings provide strong evidence of the relation between CO exposure and susceptibility to respiratory infections.
We have investigated the molecular basis of selective and complete C1s deficiency in 2-year-old girl with complex autoimmune diseases including lupus-like syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and autoimmune hepatitis. This patient's complement profile was characterized by the absence of CH50 activity, C1 functional activity <10%, and undetectable levels of C1s Ag associated with normal levels of C1r and C1q Ags. Exon-specific amplification of genomic DNA by PCR followed by direct sequence analysis revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation in the C1s gene exon XII at codon 534, caused by a nucleotide substitution from C (CGA for arginine) to T (TGA for stop codon). Both parents were heterozygous for this mutation. We used the new restriction site for endonuclease Fok-1 created by the mutation to detect this mutation in the genomic DNA of seven healthy family members. Four additional heterozygotes for the mutation were identified in two generations. Our data characterize for the first time the genetic defect of a selective and complete C1s deficiency in a Caucasian patient.
The Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Sorafenib (ARCCS) program made sorafenib available to patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) before regulatory approval.
In this nonrandomized, open-label expanded access program, 2504 patients from the United States and Canada were treated with oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Safety and efficacy were explored overall and in subgroups of patients including those with no prior therapy, nonclear cell (nonclear cell) RCC, brain metastases, prior bevacizumab treatment, and elderly patients. Sorafenib was approved for RCC 6 months after study initiation, at which time patients with no prior therapy or with nonclear cell RCC could enroll in an extension protocol for continued assessment for a period of 6 months.
The most common grade > or =2 drug-related adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (18%), rash (14%), hypertension (12%), and fatigue (11%). In the 1891 patients evaluable for response, complete response was observed in 1 patient, partial response in 67 patients (4%), and stable disease for at least 8 weeks in 1511 patients (80%). Median progression-free survival in the extension population was 36 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 33-45 weeks; censorship rate, 56%); median overall survival in the entire population was 50 weeks (95% CI, 46-52 weeks; censorship rate, 63%). The efficacy and safety results were similar across the subgroups.
Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily demonstrated activity and a clinically acceptable toxicity profile in all patient subsets enrolled in the ARCCS expanded access program (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00111020).
Tadpoles of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis were exposed, beginning at stage 50, to a commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether mixture (DE-71) through the diet. Subsequent experiments were conducted using a single intraperitoneal injection at stage 58 with limited quantities of two purified brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) congeners, BDE47 and BDE99 and DE-71 to determine the relative potency of these BDE congeners within the commercial mixture. Significant inhibition of tail resorption, delayed metamorphosis and impacts on skin pigmentation were observed in Xenopus exposed to DE-71 in the diet at nominal doses of 1000 and 5000 microgg(-1) of food. The estimated time required for 50% of the tadpoles to complete metamorphosis was significantly lengthened in Xenopus exposed to a dietary concentration of 1 microg DE-71 per gram of food. Analysis of PBDEs (sum of 32 congeners) in Xenopus from the treatment with 5000 microgg(-1) of DE-71 indicated that the frogs accumulated an average of 1030 microgg(-1) (wet weight) of PBDEs. In the intraperitoneal injection trials, similar inhibitory responses were observed in Xenopus injected with DE-71 at a nominal dose of 60 microg per tadpole, or injected with BDE47 at a nominal dose of 100 microg per tadpole. No responses were observed in Xenopus injected with BDE99 at doses up to 100 microg per tadpole. Complete inhibition of metamorphosis was observed only in the highest DE-71 dietary treatment. The results of this study are consistent with a mechanism of action of PBDEs involving competitive inhibition of binding of thyroid hormones to transporter proteins, although the mechanism cannot be definitively determined from this study. The observed effects may have occurred through other mechanisms, including sublethal toxicity. The doses used in this study are greater than the levels of PBDEs to which anurans are exposed in the environment, so further studies are required to determine whether exposure to PBDEs at environmentally relevant concentrations can affect frog metamorphosis.
We have investigated the possibility of using the pre-operative measurement of cholinesterase activity to predict the postoperative development of myalgia following the administration of suxamethonium. Seventy-seven patients presenting for elective extraction of wisdom teeth were entered in the study. All patients received a standard anaesthetic regimen, including suxamethonium to facilitate tracheal intubation, and standardised postoperative analgesia. Myalgia was assessed postoperatively and no correlation between muscle pains and cholinesterase activity was found.
Retinal degeneration is the leading cause of visual impairment in older adults. An association between retinal degeneration and fungicide use was observed previously among farmer pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study, a large study of farm families from Iowa and North Carolina. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether wives of these farmer pesticide applicators were at increased risk of retinal degeneration. Self-reported cross-sectional data obtained via questionnaire between 1993 and 1997 from 31,173 wives were used. Associations of specific pesticides and groups of pesticides based on function (fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and fumigants) or chemical structure (organophosphates, organochlorines, and carbamates) with eye disorders were evaluated using logistic and hierarchical logistic regression analyses. Self-reported retinal degeneration was associated with the wife's fungicide use (odds ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 3.1) after adjustment for age and state of residence. Specific fungicides that appeared to drive this association were maneb or mancozeb and ziram. No associations between pesticide use and other eye disorders were found. Although these findings for retinal degeneration are based solely on self-reported disease, they are consistent with those reported for farmer pesticide applicators. These findings suggest that exposure to some fungicides and other pesticides may increase the risk of retinal degeneration and warrant further investigation.
The objective of the present study was to investigate the contribution of adrenal stress hormones to strain differences in cocaine sensitivity. For this purpose, we have studied sensitisation to the locomotor stimulant effect of cocaine and, in parallel, cocaine-induced corticosterone secretion in two inbred mouse strains: C57BL/6 and DBA/2. Adrenalectomy ('ADX': surgical removal of the adrenal glands) was performed in a subset of animals to investigate the contribution of the adrenals. ADX and SHAM operated mice were subjected to repeated injections of cocaine (15.0mg/kg) or saline for nine consecutive days, followed by a 5-day withdrawal interval and a saline challenge on day 14. All animals were challenged with 7.5mg/kg cocaine on day 15. We report that repeated cocaine exposure induced locomotor sensitisation in both strains, while endocrine sensitisation was only observed in the DBA/2 strain. By contrast, cocaine attenuated corticosterone responses in C57BL/6 mice throughout the sensitisation paradigm. We have therefore identified one strain, the DBA/2 strain, that displays parallel sensitisation of cocaine-induced locomotion and -corticosterone secretion. Most interestingly, ADX prevented locomotor sensitisation only in DBA/2 mice, suggesting that behavioural sensitisation depends on the integrity of adrenal function and on secretion of adrenal glucocorticoids in this strain. The present results demonstrate that adrenal stress hormones facilitate behavioural sensitisation to cocaine in a genotype-dependent manner and suggest that glucocorticoids contribute to strain differences in psychostimulant sensitivity.
To demonstrate that arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) induces apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway in both parent T lymphoblastoid leukemia MOLT-4 cells and cells of its daunorubicin-resistant subline, MOLT-4/DNR, expressing functional P-gp.
Cell growth was measured using an MTT assay. Cell viability was determined using a dye exclusion test. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) was measured using a glutathione assay kit. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was assessed by rhodamine 123 (Rh123) staining intensity on flow cytometry. Caspase-3 activity was evaluated using a commercially available assay kit on flow cytometry. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was estimated in terms of caspase(+)/PI(-) cells on flow cytometry after assessment for activation of caspase-3 by adding PI.
MOLT-4 cells and MOLT-4/DNR cells were similarly sensitive to the apoptosis-inducing effect of As(2)O(3). Buthionine sulfoxide (BSO) and ascorbic acid (AA) rendered these cells more sensitive to As(2)O(3), whereas N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced this sensitivity. BSO and AA decreased, but NAC increased, the intracellular GSH contents of both MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cells. Decreasing GSH with BSO potentiated As(2)O(3)-mediated growth inhibition, disruption of MMP, activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis of cells. Clinically relevant doses of AA enhanced the anticancer effects of As(2)O(3) via the disruption of MMP, activation of caspase-3, and induction of apoptosis. In contrast, increase GSH levels with NAC attenuated all of these As(2)O(3)-mediated actions.
The sensitivity of MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cells to As(2)O(3) was associated with the intracellular GSH content. As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis in parent MOLT-4 cells and MOLT-4/DNR cells expressing functional P-gp via depletion of intracellular GSH, and subsequent disruption of MMP and activation of caspase-3.
Treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (t-AML) are now well established as complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy. We experienced a 28-yr-old female patient who developed t-MDS/t-AML with characteristic chromosomal abnormalities including 11q23 chromosomal rearrangement following high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient was admitted with bulky abdominal masses of B cell lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After 2 cycles of systemic chemotherapy of the Vanderbilt regimen, the patient underwent ASCT with high dose chemotherapy of the BEAC regimen. She also received radiation of 48 Gy for the residual periportal lymphadenopathy. The initial cytogenetic analysis of the infused mononuclear cells revealed a normal karyotype. Twenty two months after the ASCT, pancytopenia was noted and her bone marrow aspirate showed dysplastic hemopoiesis with myeloblasts up to 12% of nonerythroid nucleated cells. The patient was diagnosed as t-MDS (refractory anemia with an excess of blasts). Cytogenetic analysis showed complex chromosomal abnormalities including 11q23 rearrangement, which is frequently found in topoisomerase II inhibitor-related hematologic malignancies. Four months later, it was noted that the t-MDS had evolved into an overt t-AML. Cytogenetic analysis showed an evolving pattern with more complex abnormalities. The patient was treated with combination chemotherapy, but her leukemic cells were resistant to the therapy.
Expression of TGF-alpha during promotion of neoplastic development from GST-P-positive foci in rat chemical hepatocarcinogenesis was investigated. One-hundred male F344 rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of DEN (200 mg/kg bodyweight) and subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy at week 3. Commencing 2 weeks from the start, PB at doses of 0 or 500 p.p.m. was fed to the rats for 46 weeks. Groups of 10 rats were killed at weeks 4, 8, 16, 32, 48 and their livers were immunohistochemically examined for expression of GST-P and TGF-alpha. TGF-alpha-positive foci and single positive cells were observed from week 4, partially overlapping with GST-P-positive foci but being much fewer. Numbers of TGF-alpha-positive lesions did not increase from weeks 4-48, but their areas showed increment at weeks 32 and 48, especially with PB administration. Almost all of the tumors observed at weeks 16, 32 and 48 were positive for TGF-alpha (98%). In addition, epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was observed in most TGF-alpha-positive lesions (foci and tumors). The proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index in double positive foci for GST-P and TGF-alpha was significantly higher than that in TGF-alpha-negative foci. In conclusion, TGF-alpha may be closely related with promotion from altered foci to neoplasms in rat hepatocarcinogenesis. Our data suggest that double positive foci for GST-P and TGF-alpha in the early stages of rat hepatocarcinogenesis may develop into tumors with promotion.
We describe a technique for end-to-end sleeve anastomosis that may enable minimally invasive bypass grafting and characterize the tensile strength, stenosis rate, durability, and healing of the anastomosis.
An anastomotic device assembly consisting of a cable tie-type band with mobile teeth elements is mounted on the outer surface of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. The graft is drawn over the artery resulting in a sleeve of vessel within the graft. As the band is tightened over an intraluminal obturator, the independently mobile anchoring teeth are driven through the graft into the artery. The tensile strength of the anastomosis was compared with sutured anastomosis during in vitro studies using cadaveric human femoral arteries. For in vivo studies on pigs and goats, we used a proximal exovascular sleeve anastomosis along with a distal sutured aortic anastomosis. Survival animals were studied by angiogram postoperatively and at the time of explantation.
In vitro studies showed no difference in maximal tensile strength between sutured and exovascular anastomoses (10.5 +/- 2.7 lb vs 10.2 +/- 3.0 lb, P =.83). However, loss of continuous graft to artery interface occurred at lower loads in the sutured anastomoses (6.5 +/- 0.6 lb, P <.05). In total, all 24 pigs tested in nonsurvival or survival settings sustained a successful and leakproof anastomosis. Of the 13 nonsurvival cases, maximal epinephrine-induced hypertension sustained over 15 minutes (peak systolic blood pressure > 210-250 mm Hg) was tolerated without leakage in a subgroup of five animals (100%). All 11 survival pigs had no pseudoaneurysms or stenosis relative to sutured control anastomoses at 6 week explantation (8.2 +/- 1.25 mm vs 8.5 +/- 1.6 mm, P =.21). The three long-term survival goats had no pseudoaneurysm or stenosis after 40 weeks. Histologic examination confirmed healing of the aorta to graft with minimal neointimal hyperplasia.
Exovascular sutureless anastomosis appears comparable to sutured anastomosis in stenosis rate, healing, and durability, with some advantages in tensile strength and rapidity of application.
The author describes patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder observed only when they abused codeine.
To examine the effect of galantamine in elderly patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) on reaction time (RT), selective (SA) and alternating attention (AA), errors, and on interindividual and intraindividual variability.
Forty-one outpatients with AD were included in an open-label prospective trial and evaluated at baseline and after 8 and 22 weeks of treatment using a RT test that allows differentiation between the decision and movement time components of the total RT. The various tasks of the RT test allowed calculation of SA and AA. Standard AD evaluation tests were performed at baseline and after 22 weeks.
After 8 and 22 weeks of treatment, an improvement of decision time and RT at all complexity levels was noted. For movement time, improvements were less pronounced and not present at both follow-up moments or at all complexity levels. Selective attention, but not AA, improved significantly after 22 weeks. A decrease in the number of errors was noted. At several complexity levels, both at 8 and 22 weeks, the interindividual and intraindividual variability decreased. Changes in Mini Mental State Evaluation score were correlated with those in SA.
Our study provides arguments that galantamine treatment improves various parameters of the RT, attention, and interindividual and intraindividual variability in elderly AD patients. Because the study is not a controlled trial, further investigation is needed.
This study assesses the frequency that users of illicit drugs display unprofessional behaviors in an employment setting. This research was conducted in the therapeutic workplace, a model employment-based treatment program for chronically unemployed adults with long histories of illicit drug use in 2003. Fifty-three unemployed adults in methadone treatment, who were opiate and cocaine dependent, showed signs of injection drug use, and recently used cocaine were hired to work for 4 hours every weekday for 7 months. Results show that while the overall incidence of many undesirable behaviors is low, a small percentage of participants had serious workplace behavior problems that might limit their success in community workplaces. This study suggests that unprofessional behavior in the workplace could contribute to chronic unemployment in this population. The study's limitations are noted and future needed research is suggested.
