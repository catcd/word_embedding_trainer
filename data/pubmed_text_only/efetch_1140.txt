So far, a beneficial effect of combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and β-blocker therapy for systolic dysfunction in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has been reported only in patients in whom DMD was due to deletions in the dystrophin gene.
In a 24-year-old male with DMD due to the point mutation c.4213C>T (p.Gln1405X) in exon 30 of the dystrophin gene, cardiologic examination at the age of 23 years revealed asymptomatic severely reduced systolic dysfunction with a fractional shortening of 14% in the absence of dilated cardiomyopathy. A combined therapy with enalapril (2.5 mg/day) and bisoprolol (1.25 mg/day) was initiated. After a slow increase in the dosage to 10 mg enalapril/day and 2.5 mg bisoprolol/day, systolic dysfunction resolved to a fractional shortening of 26% already after 7 months.
This case shows that asymptomatic reduced systolic function also in patients with DMD due to a point mutation responds favourably to a combination therapy with ACEI and β-blockers.
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of retinal diseases leading to blindness. By performing full genome linkage analysis in a consanguineous French family affected with severe autosomal recessive RP, we have excluded linkage to known loci involved in RP and mapped a novel locus to chromosome 16q13-q21 (Zmax=2.83 at theta=0 at the D16S3089 locus). Two candidate genes KIFC3 and CNGB1 mapping to this critical interval have been screened for mutations. The CNGB1 gene, which encodes the beta-subunit of the rod cGMP-gated channel, is mutated in the family presented in this study.
Exposure of male reproductive organs to 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) has been reported to cause developmental changes. In this study, we evaluated the effects of in utero TCDD exposure on male reproductive development.
Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of TCDD (1 microg/kg) on gestation day (GD) 15. The offspring were examined in the immature stage on postnatal day (PND) 30 and in the mature stage on PND 60. The testes were examined for histological changes, androgen receptor (AR), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and apoptosis following the measurement of morphological changes.
Anogenital distance (AGD) and testis weights were reduced by TCDD exposure both on PND 30 and PND 60 while body weights and length of male offspring were not affected by TCDD. The regular sperm developmental stage was impaired with TCDD treatment on PND 30. However, no difference was found between the control group and TCDD groups on PND 60. Simultaneously, the expression of AR was also reduced on PND 30, while it was increased on PND 60 compared with the control group. The expression of PCNA was decreased whereas apoptosis was not affected by TCDD both on PND 30 and PND 60.
These results suggest that in utero exposure to TCDD influences the development of testes by inhibiting the expression of AR and PCNA. Moreover, the adverse effects of TCDD on male offspring reduced over time.
MAJOR FINDING: ROS1 chromosomal rearrangements define a molecular subtype of NSCLC.
ROS1 rearrangements tend to occur in younger, non-smoking NSCLC patients.
ROS1-positive NSCLC patients may benefit from crizotinib therapy.
The usefulness of fusidic acid, alone or combined with vancomycin, was investigated for the therapy of experimental endocarditis caused in rabbits by a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro killing curves showed an indifferent interaction between the two antibiotics. In vivo, vancomycin alone was as effective as a vancomycin-fusidic acid combination (P < 0.05 versus control animals). No resistance to fusidic acid emerged during combination therapy. Fusidic acid alone was not effective. Resistance emerged in 5 of 12 animals treated with fusidic acid alone and was responsible for antibacterial failure. Fusidic acid alone was effective (P < 0.001) and did not select resistant strains if therapy was started when animals retained a smaller inoculum. We concluded that the vancomycin-fusidic acid combination exhibited no advantage over vancomycin alone in this model.
We evaluated the effects of hypocapnia on arterial oxygenation during induced hypotension with nitroglycerin (TNG) or prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in patients undergoing mastectomy. Of the 20 patients studied, 10 belonged to TNG group and 10 belonged to PGE1 group. Mean arterial pressure during induced hypotension was maintained at 70% of the values observed before hypotension. A significant decrease in PaO2 was observed during hypotension under normocapnia (PaCO2 35-40 mmHg) in both groups. In addition, small but significant reduction in PaO2 from 128.5 +/- 23.7 mmHg to 122.5 +/- 25.5 mmHg in TNG group and from 129.9 +/- 11.9 mmHG to 116.7 +/- 15.6 mmHg in PGE1 group were induced by hypocapnia (PaCO2 27-30 mmHg) during hypotension. These findings suggest that usual dose of TNG and PGE1 might not or might partially inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.
The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence of leukopenia and other blood dyscrasias associated with psychiatric use of carbamazepine and valproate.
Rates of WBC counts of 3,000-4,000/mm3 (moderate leukopenia) and < 3,000/mm3 (severe leukopenia), platelet counts of < 100,000/mm3, and hematocrit < 30% were identified among 2,228 treated patients at risk among 11,720 patients admitted to McLean Hospital over 4 years (1989-1993). Patients who received carbamazepine or valproate and had a blood dyscrasia not associated with a relevant medical condition were compared to patients treated with imipramine or desipramine.
Of 977 patients treated with carbamazepine, 2.1% experienced leukopenia (16 moderate cases, five severe). Time to 50% risk was 16 days, and recovery occurred within about 6 days after carbamazepine was stopped. For 1,251 patients given valproate, the occurrence of leukopenia was 0.4% (three moderate cases, two severe). The occurrence of leukopenia in 1,031 patients given the tricyclic antidepressants was 0.3% (two moderate cases, one severe). The observed occurrence of moderate leukopenia with carbamazepine was 6.9 and 7.3 times higher than that with valproate and antidepressants, respectively.
Severe blood dyscrasias were uncommon in psychiatric patients given carbamazepine and were about as rare with valproate as with imipramine or desipramine. Most important, in this cohort of 2,228 patients exposed to carbamazepine and valproate, there were no life-threatening cases.
The effect of a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg body weight dichlorvos on neuronal microtubule phosphorylation has been studied in rat following the development of organophosphate induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN). Microtubule associated Ca2+/calmodulin dependent as well as cAMP dependent protein kinases were assayed. Dichlorvos administration led to a consistent increase in the activity of both the kinases at all post exposure intervals (7th, 15th and 21st day) as compared to that of controls. After in vitro phosphorylation using [gamma-32P]ATP, various proteins were resolved on one-dimensional 8% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue and autoradiographed. The amount of 32P incorporated was quantified by microdensitometry. Dichlorvos enhanced the phosphorylation of 55- and 280-kDa proteins. These two proteins were identified as tubulin and microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) by immunoblotting. This study showed that dichlorvos induced hyperphosphorylation of tubulin and MAP-2 which in turn destabilizes microtubule assembly, and may ultimately result in axonal degeneration leading to dichlorvos induced delayed neurotoxicity.
1. The hypothesis that adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH)-induced hypertension is a consequence of steroid-induced hyperinsulinaemia was tested using the somatostatin analogue (sandostatin, octreotide) to inhibit insulin release in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 41). 2. Octreotide (20 micrograms, twice daily) did not modify blood pressure, plasma glucose, bodyweight, water and electrolyte balance, or organ weights but inhibited insulin secretion in the SD rat. 3. Compared with sham injection, ACTH-treated (0.5 mg/kg per day) SD rats showed an increase in blood pressure (sham 111 +/- 4 mmHg; ACTH 140 +/- 5 mmHg on treatment day 10 (P < 0.01), organ weights, water intake, urine volume, plasma glucose, insulin and sodium concentrations, and decrease of bodyweight and plasma potassium concentration. 4. Systolic blood pressure in rats treated with combined octreotide and ACTH was similar to that in rats on ACTH alone. Plasma insulin concentration was lower in octreotide + ACTH treated rats than with ACTH treatment alone. There were no differences in body or organ weights, plasma glucose, water or electrolyte balance. 5. Octreotide lowered plasma insulin concentration to the normal range but did not modify ACTH-induced hypertension in SD rats. These data do not support the notion that insulin-mediated alterations in blood pressure are a major mechanism for ACTH-induced hypertension in the rat.
We report on the manifestation of a levetiracetam (LEV)-induced encephalopathy.
A 28-year-old man suffering from idiopathic epilepsy with generalized seizures was treated with LEV (3000 mg) added to valproate (VPA) (2000 mg). Frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures increased from one per 6 months to two per month. Neuropsychological testing showed impaired word fluency, psychomotor speed and working memory. The interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a generalized slowing to 5 per second theta rhythms with bilateral generalized high-amplitude discharges.
Following discontinuation of LEV, EEG and neuropsychological findings improved and seizure frequency decreased.
Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.
This study evaluated the interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with diabetes and arsenic exposure in drinking water on the risk of developing T2DM.
In 2009-2011, we conducted a follow up study of 957 Bangladeshi adults who participated in a case-control study of arsenic-induced skin lesions in 2001-2003. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between 38 SNPs in 18 genes and risk of T2DM measured at follow up. T2DM was defined as having a blood hemoglobin A1C level greater than or equal to 6.5% at follow-up. Arsenic exposure was characterized by drinking water samples collected from participants' tubewells. False discovery rates were applied in the analysis to control for multiple comparisons.
Median arsenic levels in 2001-2003 were higher among diabetic participants compared with non-diabetic ones (71.6 µg/L vs. 12.5 µg/L, p-value <0.001). Three SNPs in ADAMTS9 were nominally associated with increased risk of T2DM (rs17070905, Odds Ratio (OR)  = 2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-4.50; rs17070967, OR = 2.02, 95%CI 1.00-4.06; rs6766801, OR = 2.33, 95%CI 1.18-4.60), but these associations did not reach the statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons. A significant interaction between arsenic and NOTCH2 (rs699780) was observed which significantly increased the risk of T2DM (p for interaction = 0.003; q-value = 0.021). Further restricted analysis among participants exposed to water arsenic of less than 148 µg/L showed consistent results for interaction between the NOTCH2 variant and arsenic exposure on T2DM (p for interaction  = 0.048; q-value = 0.004).
These findings suggest that genetic variation in NOTCH2 increased susceptibility to T2DM among people exposed to inorganic arsenic. Additionally, genetic variants in ADAMTS9 may increase the risk of T2DM.
Epidemiologic and animal studies revealed that capsaicin can act as a carcinogen or cocarcinogen. However, the molecular mechanisms of the cancer-promoting effects of capsaicin are not clear. Here, we report that capsaicin has a cocarcinogenic effect on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-promoted skin carcinogenesis in vivo and is mediated through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but not the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). Topical application of capsaicin on the dorsal skin of 7,12-dimetylbenz(a)anthracene-initiated and TPA-promoted TRPV1 wild-type (WT) and TRPV1 knockout (KO) mice induced more and larger skin tumors in TRPV1/KO mice, suggesting a TRPV1-independent mechanism. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was highly elevated by capsaicin treatment in tumors and murine embryonic fibroblasts from TRPV1/KO mice. Inhibitors of EGFR/MEK signaling suppressed TPA/capsaicin-induced COX-2 expression in TRPV1/KO cells, indicating that activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling is involved in COX-2 elevation. Capsaicin induced a further induction of TPA-increased COX-2 expression in EGFR/WT cells, but not in EGFR/KO cells. TPA/capsaicin cotreatment caused EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and activated EGFR downstream signaling, including ERKs and Akt in EGFR/WT, but not EGFR/KO cells. Specific inhibition of EGFR and TRPV1 indicated that capsaicin-induced ERK activation in A431 cells was dependent on EGFR, but not TRPV1. Together, these findings suggest that capsaicin might act as a cocarcinogen in TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis through EGFR-dependent mechanisms.
Cocaine causes serious neurologic and neuropsychiatric complications. Cocaine-induced seizures are common and appear to be due to the local anaesthetic actions of this compound. Cocaine induced stroke has varied mechanisms. With ischemic stroke there is severe vasospasm induced by rises in brain catecholamines. These changes can persist for many weeks and can be demonstrated using single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). In many patients with psychiatric symptoms such as psychosis or mania, SPECT demonstrates similar changes in cerebral blood flow. In fact, some of the psychiatric symptoms induced by cocaine may be due to decreases in cerebral blood flow. In cocaine abuse, treatment strategies based on decreasing cerebral vasospasm need to be developed.
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy of adolescents and young adults. To better understand the genetic etiology of osteosarcoma, we performed a multistage genome-wide association study consisting of 941 individuals with osteosarcoma (cases) and 3,291 cancer-free adult controls of European ancestry. Two loci achieved genome-wide significance: a locus in the GRM4 gene at 6p21.3 (encoding glutamate receptor metabotropic 4; rs1906953; P = 8.1 × 10⁻⁹) and a locus in the gene desert at 2p25.2 (rs7591996 and rs10208273; P = 1.0 × 10⁻⁸ and 2.9 × 10⁻⁷, respectively). These two loci warrant further exploration to uncover the biological mechanisms underlying susceptibility to osteosarcoma.
Zbtb7a has previously been described as a powerful proto-oncogene. Here we unexpectedly demonstrate that Zbtb7a has a critical oncosuppressive role in the prostate. Prostate-specific inactivation of Zbtb7a leads to a marked acceleration of Pten loss-driven prostate tumorigenesis through bypass of Pten loss-induced cellular senescence (PICS). We show that ZBTB7A physically interacts with SOX9 and functionally antagonizes its transcriptional activity on key target genes such as MIA, which is involved in tumor cell invasion, and H19, a long noncoding RNA precursor for an RB-targeting microRNA. Inactivation of Zbtb7a in vivo leads to Rb downregulation, PICS bypass and invasive prostate cancer. Notably, we found that ZBTB7A is genetically lost, as well as downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels, in a subset of human advanced prostate cancers. Thus, we identify ZBTB7A as a context-dependent cancer gene that can act as an oncogene in some contexts but also has oncosuppressive-like activity in PTEN-null tumors.
Known agonists of the orphan receptor GPR35 are kynurenic acid, zaprinast, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylproplyamino) benzoic acid, and lysophosphatidic acids. Their relatively low affinities for GPR35 and prominent off-target effects at other pathways, however, diminish their utility for understanding GPR35 signaling and for identifying potential therapeutic uses of GPR35. In a screen of the Prestwick Library of drugs and drug-like compounds, we have found that pamoic acid is a potent GPR35 agonist. Pamoic acid is considered by the Food and Drug Administration as an inactive compound that enables long-acting formulations of numerous drugs, such as the antihelminthics oxantel pamoate and pyrantel pamoate; the psychoactive compounds hydroxyzine pamoate (Vistaril) and imipramine pamoate (Tofranil-PM); and the peptide hormones triptorelin pamoate (Trelstar) and octreotide pamoate (OncoLar). We have found that pamoic acid induces a G(i/o)-linked, GPR35-mediated increase in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, recruitment of β-arrestin2 to GPR35, and internalization of GPR35. In mice, it attenuates visceral pain perception, indicating an antinociceptive effect, possibly through GPR35 receptors. We have also identified in collaboration with the Sanford-Burnham Institute Molecular Libraries Probe Production Center new classes of GPR35 antagonist compounds, including the nanomolar potency antagonist methyl-5-[(tert-butylcarbamothioylhydrazinylidene)methyl]-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyrazole-4-carboxylate (CID2745687). Pamoic acid and potent antagonists such as CID2745687 present novel opportunities for expanding the chemical space of GPR35, elucidating GPR35 pharmacology, and stimulating GPR35-associated drug development. Our results indicate that the unexpected biological functions of pamoic acid may yield potential new uses for a common drug constituent.
The severity of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) is decreased in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. However, joint inflammation in AIA depends on the immune response, which is impaired in ob/ob mice. In the present study we investigated the effects of leptin deficiency on zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA), which is independent of adaptive immunity. Arthritis was induced by injection of zymosan into the knee joint. Joint swelling was similar after 6 and 24 hours in ob/ob and control mice. However, it remained elevated in ob/ob animals on day 3 whereas values normalized in controls. Histology revealed similar articular lesions in all animals on day 3, but on days 14 and 21 arthritis tended to be more severe in ob/ob mice. The acute phase response, reflected by circulating levels of IL-6 and serum amyloid A, was also more pronounced in ob/ob mice, although corticosterone was significantly elevated in these animals. Similar results were obtained in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice. Thus, in contrast to AIA, ZIA is not impaired in leptin-deficient animals. On the contrary, resolution of acute inflammation appears to be delayed in the absence of leptin or leptin signalling, suggesting that chronic leptin deficiency interferes with adequate control of the inflammatory response in ZIA.
Maternal smoking leads to intrauterine undernutrition and is associated with low birthweight and higher risk of offspring obesity. Intrauterine smoke exposure (SE) may alter neuroendocrine mediators regulating energy homeostasis as chemicals in cigarette smoke can reach the fetus. Maternal high-fat diet (HFD) consumption causes fetal overnutrition; however, combined effects of HFD and SE are unknown. Thus we investigated the impact of combined maternal HFD and SE on adiposity and energy metabolism in offspring.
Female Balb/c mice had SE (2 cigarettes/day, 5 days/week) or were sham exposed for 5 weeks before mating. Half of each group was fed HFD (33% fat) versus chow as control. The same treatment continued throughout gestation and lactation. Female offspring were fed chow after weaning and sacrificed at 12 weeks.
Birthweights were similar across maternal groups. Faster growth was evident in pups from SE and/or HFD dams before weaning. At 12 weeks, offspring from HFD-fed dams were significantly heavier than those from chow-fed dams (chow-sham 17.6±0.3 g; chow-SE 17.8±0.2 g; HFD-sham 18.7±0.3 g; HFD-SE 18.8±0.4 g, P<0.05 maternal diet effect); fat mass was significantly greater in offspring from chow+SE, HFD+SE and HFD+sham dams. Both maternal HFD and SE affected brain lactate transport. Glucose intolerance and impaired brain response to insulin were observed in SE offspring, and this was aggravated by maternal HFD consumption.
While maternal HFD led to increased body weight in offspring, maternal SE independently programmed adverse health outcomes in offspring. A smoke free environment and healthy diet during pregnancy is desirable to optimize offspring health.
Drug-induced vascular injury is frequently observed in rats but the relevance and translation to humans present a hurdle for drug development. Numerous structurally diverse pharmacologic agents have been shown to induce mesenteric arterial medial necrosis in rats, but no consistent biomarkers have been identified. To address this need, a novel strategy was developed in rats to identify genes associated with the development of drug-induced mesenteric arterial medial necrosis. Separate groups (n=6/group) of male rats were given 28 different toxicants (30 different treatments) for 1 or 4 days with each toxicant given at 3 different doses (low, mid and high) plus corresponding vehicle (912 total rats). Mesentery was collected, frozen and endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells were microdissected from each artery. RNA was isolated, amplified and Affymetrix GeneChip® analysis was performed on selectively enriched samples and a novel panel of genes representing those which showed a dose responsive pattern for all treatments in which mesenteric arterial medial necrosis was histologically observed, was developed and verified in individual endothelial cell- and vascular smooth muscle cell-enriched samples. Data were confirmed in samples containing mesentery using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (TaqMan™) gene expression profiling. In addition, the performance of the panel was also confirmed using similarly collected samples obtained from a timecourse study in rats given a well established vascular toxicant (Fenoldopam). Although further validation is still required, a novel gene panel has been developed that represents a strategic opportunity that can potentially be used to help predict the occurrence of drug-induced mesenteric arterial medial necrosis in rats at an early stage in drug development.
Toxicity and interaction of topical application of dichlorvoscrotoxyphos (D-C) insecticide and phenothiazine anthelmintic (PTZ) given in the diet were studied in 4 groups of 4-5 lambs each that had had prior drug exposure. In a study reported previously each lamb in groups 1 and 2 was sprayed with 3 biweekly topical applications of 1550 ml of 0.25% D-C emulsion. Groups 1 and 3 were treated with PTZ (12.5 g/sheep initially and 4 days later with 6.25 g every 3 days for 9 treatments). Group 4 was the control. Following termination of that study the animals were given a 30-day nonmedicated period and reused in the present study as described below. Each lamb in group 1 and 3 was challenged with PTZ given in the diet (1g/sheep/day for 3 days). On the third day of PTZ administration, each lamb in group 1 and 2 was sprayed with 1 gallon of 0.25% D-C emulsion. The 4th group served as a control. Following D-C spray, clinical signs of toxicosis were seen within 17 min in 56% of the exposed lambs regardless of concurrent PTZ treatment. The erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (EACE) activities of the D-C exposed groups were significantly (P less than 0.05) depressed on post-treatment days (PTD) 1 and 3 regardless of the PTZ treatment. The base-line EACE values were reestablished on PTD 18. The PTZ alone was not toxic and did not inhibit EACE activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Arginine methylation is an epigenetic modification that receives increasing interest as it plays an important role in several diseases. This is especially true for hormone-dependent cancer, seeing that histone methylation by arginine methyltransferase I (PRMT1) is involved in the activation of sexual hormone receptors. Therefore, PRMT inhibitors are potential drugs and interesting tools for cell biology. A dapsone derivative called allantodapsone previously identified by our group served as a lead structure for inhibitor synthesis. Acylated derivatives of p-aminobenzenesulfonamides and the antilepra drug dapsone were identified as new inhibitors of PRMT1 by in vitro testing. The bis-chloroacetyl amide of dapsone selectively inhibited human PRMT1 in the low micromolar region and was selective for PRMT1 as compared to the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 and the lysine methyltransferase Set7/9. It showed anticancer activity on MCF7a and LNCaP cells and blocked androgen dependent transcription specifically in a reporter gene system. Likewise, a transcriptional block was also demonstrated in LNCaP cells using quantitative RT-PCR on the mRNA of androgen dependent genes.
We investigated the effect of two different doses of dexmedetomidine on vasospasm in a rat model of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). SAH was induced by injecting 0.3 mL blood into the cisterna magna in all rat groups except the control (Group C). At 1 hour and 24 hours after SAH, 5 microg/kg dexmedetomidine was given to group D5, and 10 microg/kg dexmedetomidine was given to group D10. No medication was administered to the haemorrhage group (Group H). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and paraoxonase (PON) levels were measured at 48 hours after SAH. Mean wall thickness (MWT), mean luminal diameter (MLD), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression of the basilar artery were evaluated. MDA levels and MWT were lower in the dexmedetomidine groups. The lowest MDA levels and MWT were found in Group D10. The MLD was lowest in Group H. PCNA expression was observed only in Group D10. We concluded that dexmedetomidine reduces oxidative stress and vasospasm following SAH in a dose-dependent manner.
In the following case report we present a 43-year-old male patient diagnosed with schizophrenia, paranoid type, who exhibited nocturnal tardive akathisia or pseydoakathisia approximately one year after being treated with clozapine 300 mg per day. Because of the low occurrence of akathisia due to clozapine, the episodes of restlessness were at first considered as a sign of worsening of the patient's psychopathology. Since the patient was resistant to other antipsychotic agents, clozapine was reinitiated. A week later, the patient once again exhibited episodes of restlessness. This time, the episodes were diagnosed as akathisia and the patient was treated with biperidene and lorazepam, while he had already been on propanolol for cardiovascular reasons. The episodes continued without any change in frequency or severity. Therefore, treatment with clozapine was discontinued and the patient was started on a new regimen with ziprasidone. Three days later, the episodes that caused distress to the patient resolved. Thus, it is possible that apart from episodes of acute akathisia, episodes of tardive akathisia or pseydoakathisia can also occur in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.
Brugada syndrome (BS) is an electrical cardiac disorder with a right bundle branch block and ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3 on surface electrocardiograms (ECGs), and is a syndrome that may lead to sudden cardiac death.
The aim of the present study was to screen for mutations in the SCN5A gene in a family with BS, and to characterize the consequences of the mutation on channel function.
A heterozygous nonsense SCN5A mutation (W822X) was identified in the index patient. The mutation was confirmed in the patient's asymptomatic 16-year-old brother and 48-year-old father. The mutation was absent in the index patient's sister and mother. The ECG of the index patient showed a BS type 2 ECG phenotype, which converted into a type 1 ECG phenotype in the presence of flecainide. The ECG of the patient's brother was not typical for BS, but ajmaline treatment unmasked a type 1 ECG phenotype. The ECG of the asymptomatic father was normal at baseline and in the presence of ajmaline. No Na+ currents could be measured in tsA201 cells transfected with W822X mutant channels. Heterozygote expression showed a nearly 50% reduction in Na+ current amplitude with no significant alterations of biophysical properties, indicating a loss of functional Na+ channels, obviously without any dominant-negative activity on wild type channels.
The haploinsufficiency of the Nav1.5 protein is the plausible explanation for the clinical BS phenotype in this family. Because the heterozygous W822X mutation theoretically leads to channel expression at one-half of the normal level, the authors suggest that a modifier gene may influence or rescue the phenotype in the asymptomatic family members.
In two prospective, randomized studies the frequency of headache, nausea, vomiting, and analgesic requirement during the first postoperative 24 h was observed in order to study differences between the sexes and the inhalation anesthetics halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, or balanced anesthesia with enflurane/alfentanil. Nausea and vomiting were more frequent after enflurane than after halothane or isoflurane. There was no significant difference between anesthetics and frequency of headache, but there were significant differences in postoperative analgesic requirements which were highest after halothane and lowest after isoflurane. Postoperative complaints were always significantly greater among women than among men. The second study indicated that balanced anesthesia did not reduce the analgesic requirement compared to enflurane without alfentanil, but lead to a higher incidence of vomiting. After premedication with flunitrazepam and atropine and combined with 70% N2O/30% O2, isoflurane was the most favorable anesthetic agent with regard to the parameters studied. Balanced anesthesia with enflurane/alfentanil did not show any advantages for patients in the postoperative phase under the given conditions.
Doppler can evaluate renal vascular resistance, and resistance index (RI) highly correlates with blood pressure and renal function in various pathological conditions. Purpose of the study was to measure and compare renal Doppler indices in patients with newly-diagnosed essential hypertension (EH) and in healthy subjects; to determine changes of Doppler indices in patients after six-months monotherapy with either the AT II blocker (valsartane) or calcium channel blocker (niphedipine); to determine which drug has better renoprotective effect. 65 healthy controls were examined, as well as 69 patients with the newly-diagnosed EH, without signs of the target organ damage. Duplex Doppler US of interlobar intrarenal arteries was performed, and RI, acceleration index (AI) and acceleration time (AT) measured. Antihypertensive monotherapy was performed with vaslartane in 34 patients and with niphedipine in 35 patients. Doppler was repeated after the six-months therapy. RI in patients with the 1. stage of EH is significantly higher compared to the controls (p < 0.001), and significantly lower compared to the stage 2. of EH (p < 0.001). The significant decrease of systolic (p < 0.001) and dyastolic blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.001) was noted after the therapy. RI in healthy examinees (RI = 0.59 +/- 0.023) is significantly lower than in EH (RI = 0.66 +/- 0.26) (p < 0.001), while AI is significantly higher (p < 0.001), and AT is significantly lower (p < 0.001). In patients treated with valsartane and those treated with niphedipine, the RIs are significantly lower than before (p < 0.001), while AIs were significantly higher, and ATs were significantly lower after the therapy after the therapy with both drugs. RIs in patients treated with valsartane (RI = 0.615 +/- 0.036) are significantly lower than RIs of patients treated with niphedipine (RI = 0.642 +/- 0.030) (p < 0.01) after therapy. Regression analysis for the predictive values of RI, AT, AI in relation to the age-standardized values of systolic and diastolic BP of healthy examinees and patients with hypertension has demonstrated that RI is the strongest and statistically significant predictor in all groups of examinees. Six-months monotherapy of EH with valsartane or with niphedipine is equally efficient in the decrease of the blood pressure, but valsartane has more favourable effect on kidney. Resistance index measured in intrarenal arteries is the best parameter of Doppler spectrum in the evaluation of the effects of antihypertensive therapy on the kidney.
