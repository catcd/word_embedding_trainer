The adverse effect of bisphenol-A (BPA) on the male reproductive system observed in animal studies has not been well examined in human populations. BPA is potentially a serious public health problem because of its widely detected presence in the human body. This study was conducted among 427 male workers in regions where high levels of BPA exposure existed. All participants provided urine samples, which were tested for BPA concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. Male sexual dysfunction was ascertained using standard male sexual function inventories. Male sexual dysfunction was measured in 4 domains using 7 indices. After controlling for potential confounders using linear regression, increasing urine BPA level was associated with worsening male sexual function on a continuous scale. All 7 indices demonstrated this negative linear correlation. Increasing urine BPA level was associated with decreased sexual desire (P < .001), more difficulty having an erection (P < .001), lower ejaculation strength (P < .001), and lower level of overall satisfaction with sex life (P < .01). A similar negative correlation was also observed among participants exposed to BPA from only environmental sources (no occupational exposure to BPA), although the estimates in this group were less stable because of a smaller sample size. Our results reveal a correlation between a biological measure of urine BPA level and declining male sexual function. This finding may enhance the understanding of the BPA effect in human populations, and may have important public health implications given the widespread human exposure to BPA.
Colony-stimulating activity (CSA) was measured by the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (GM-CFU) from normal donor bone marrow in the plasma of 29 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after intensive treatment with high-dose melphalan (HDM) with or without autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMR). Although patients who received ABMR had an earlier recovery of circulating neutrophils compared with those who received HDM alone, the time at which CSA reached a maximum was similar in both groups (10 to 11 days) after therapy. The decline in CSA correlated with the recovery of the neutrophil count. In plasma from patients who received recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), in addition to an autograft, CSA reached a maximum earlier (7 days). Furthermore, neutrophil recovery was earlier in these patients. Platelet recovery was not increased by rhG-CSF. The time at which CSA was maximum in four patients who were undergoing intensive therapy for the second time occurred 9 days after treatment with HDM. Although the period without neutrophils was longer in three (of four) patients who survived long term, one patient who received rhG-CSF had a shorter period of neutropenia than the two who had not had the cytokine. G-CSF was detected in plasma from seven of seven patients but not at all times after treatment. In plasma samples that contained G-CSF, colony numbers were increased by recombinant interleukin-4 (rIL-4) in vitro. Neither IL-3 nor GM-CSF was detected in plasma; however, antibody to GM-CSF reduced CSA in all samples after intensive therapy. The data suggest that CSA is a consistent physiologic response to intensive therapy, even in previously treated patients, but that hematologic recovery is dependent on the availability of viable progenitor cells.
We have previously shown that ML-7, which inhibits myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), induces apoptosis in transformed and non-transformed cells. We have extended these studies and found that ML-7 stimulates the ability of etoposide to induce apoptosis in Mm5MT mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells and Mat-Ly-Lu rat prostate cancer cells in vitro. ML-7 was also found to have a chemopreventive effect using an in vitro mouse mammary organ culture model. In vivo experiments demonstrated that ML-7 retards the growth of mammary tumours in mice and prostate tumours in rats. Moreover, ML-7 significantly stimulates the ability of etoposide to prevent the growth of established mammary tumours in mice and prostate tumours in rats. These results provide evidence for the efficacy of ML-7 as an adjuvant to etoposide in these models and warrants further development.
A 68-year-old man, with Hairy Cell Leukemia developed a Guillain-Barré syndrome (G-B), 32 days after a single course of 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (CDA) at 0,14 mg/k/d, for five days in a two-hour-i.v. infusion and following a febrile neutropenia episode. In order to clarify whether this G-B case was related to an infection or to CDA neurotoxicity, we screened for infection-related autoimmune G-B and for antibodies (abs.) against gangliosides of peripheral nerves. Blood and urinary cultures were negative as well as serum anti-virus abs. However, serum anti-ganglioside abs. were positive for anti-asialo GM1 and anti-Gd1b. This latter finding was consistent with an autoimmune mechanism, not described until now as CDA neurotoxicity. In the present case, we do not have enough evidence to link CDA administration to the G-B syndrome. We think that it is necessary to exclude other causes of neurotoxicity before considering CDA adverse effect.
Sexual dysfunction is a frequent side effect of antipsychotic treatment. Increased prolactin levels are believed to be responsible for this sexual impairment despite contradictory results.
The primary objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between sexual dysfunction, subjective well-being and prolactin levels in patients with schizophrenia treated either with risperidone or quetiapine. The secondary objective was to explore the relationship between testosterone and the severity of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia in male patients.
In a 4-week nonrandomized open label observational study, 102 inpatients with schizophrenia were recruited. Sexual functioning, subjective well-being and endocrinological parameters were assessed as well as psychopathological characteristics.
Two self-rating questionnaires concerned with sexual functioning ("Essener Fragebogen zur Sexualität") and Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptic Treatment Scale (SWN) were completed by the patients. Plasma levels of prolactin in male and female patients were measured. Furthermore, in male patients testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were determined. Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) was applied.
After 4 weeks, patients treated with quetiapine reported less severe sexual impairment, as well as lower PANSS negative and general score compared with patients treated with risperidone. Additionally, emotional regulation as measured with the SWN was higher in patients treated with quetiapine. Risperidone was significantly associated with elevated prolactin levels. Prolactin levels were not correlated either with sexual dysfunction or PANSS. However, in the group of patients treated risperidone, sexual impairment was significantly associated with the SWN subscale emotional regulation.
Increased prolactin levels do not seem to be decisive for antipsychotic induced sexual dysfunction. Improvement of severity of illness and regaining the ability to regulate one's own emotion have positive influence on sexual functioning.
The majority of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients are over sixty years of age. With current treatment regimens, survival rates amongst these, and also those younger patients who relapse, remain dismal and novel therapies are urgently required. In particular, therapies that have anti-leukaemic activity but that, unlike conventional chemotherapy, do not impair normal haemopoiesis.
Here we demonstrate the potent anti-leukaemic activity of the combination of the lipid-regulating drug bezafibrate (BEZ) and the sex hormone medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) against AML cell lines and primary AML cells. The combined activity of BEZ and MPA (B/M) converged upon the increased synthesis and reduced metabolism of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) resulting in elevated levels of the downstream highly bioactive, anti-neoplastic prostaglandin 15-deoxy Delta(12,14) PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)). BEZ increased PGD(2) synthesis via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the lipid peroxidation pathway. MPA directed prostaglandin synthesis towards 15d-PGJ(2) by inhibiting the PGD(2) 11beta -ketoreductase activity of the aldo-keto reductase AKR1C3, which metabolises PGD(2) to 9alpha11beta-PGF(2alpha). B/M treatment resulted in growth arrest, apoptosis and cell differentiation in both AML cell lines and primary AML cells and these actions were recapitulated by treatment with 15d-PGJ(2). Importantly, the actions of B/M had little effect on the survival of normal adult myeloid progenitors.
Collectively our data demonstrate that B/M treatment of AML cells elevated ROS and delivered the anti-neoplastic actions of 15d-PGJ(2). These observations provide the mechanistic rationale for the redeployment of B/M in elderly and relapsed AML.
Pyomyositis is infrequently reported in patients with multiple myeloma. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is emerging as an important cause of soft tissue infections, including pyomyositis. Here, we report on the first case of CA-MRSA pyomyositis in a patient with multiple myeloma and review the relevant literature.
Five - Fluorouracil (5 FU) is widely used in oncology, especially in tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and in carcinoma of the breast. Its side effects (gastrointestinal, haematological, alopecia) are well known. However, its cardiac effects are not widely appreciated, despite an incidence similar to that observed with the anthracyclines (1.6% vs 2.2%) and a high mortality rate (12.5%). A new case of coronary insufficiency is reported illustrating the absence of a dose-effect relationship and the frequency of recurrence of symptoms when 5 FU is reintroduced even with coronary vasodilator therapy. The mechanism of cardiotoxicity in this case seems to be coronary spasm.
A growing number of studies indicate that breast cancer initiation is related to abnormal estrogen oxidation to form an excess of estrogen-3,4-quinones, which react with DNA to form depurinating adducts and induce mutations. This mechanism is often called estrogen genotoxicity. 4-Catechol estrogens, precursors of the estrogen-3,4-quinones, were previously shown to account for most of the transforming and tumorigenic activity. We examined whether estrogen-induced transformation can be reduced by inhibiting the oxidation of a 4-catechol estrogen to its quinone. We demonstrate that E6 cells (a normal mouse epithelial cell line) can be transformed by a single treatment with a catechol estrogen or its quinone. The transforming activities of 4-hydroxyestradiol and estradiol-3,4-quinone were comparable. N-Acetylcysteine, a common antioxidant, inhibited the oxidation of 4-hydroxyestradiol to the quinone and consequent formation of DNA adducts. It also drastically reduced estrogen-induced transformation of E6 cells. These results strongly implicate estrogen genotoxicity in mammary cell transformation. Since N-acetylcysteine is well tolerated in clinical studies, it may be a promising candidate for breast cancer prevention.
Systolic time intervals (PEP/LVET ratio) were used for detection of acute variations in myocardial contractility after a single dose of 30, 60, or 75 mg of doxorubicin/m2. This drug induces an acute impairment of left ventricular function (increase in the PEP/LVET ratio) detectable 1 h after doxorubicin injection. The phenomenon appears to be dose-related, with a threshold dose of 30-40 mg/m2. The decrease in myocardial contractility is fully reversible within 24 h, at least after the first dose. This kind of evaluation appears applicable to phase I studies of new anthracycline derivatives.
We studied 60 patients to find out whether anxiety affects the dose of midazolam necessary for sedation, and whether operating time, dose of midazolam, or technique have any influence on levels of amnesia and anxiety. A pilot study preceded the main study in which 20 patients were given local anaesthesia only and 20 local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation. Patients in the main study group (n = 60) received both local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation. The dose required for sedation was not linked to amnesia, pulse rate, blood pressure, or preoperative anxiety. Sedation did significantly reduce postoperative anxiety scores, (P< 0.001) and amnesia was affected by operating time; complete surgical amnesia seemed to last about 25 minutes.
The effect of the immunosuppressive drug FK 506 on encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats was studied. Treatment that began during EAE induction delayed EAE onset, but when the disease started it was chronic/progressive and of unusual severity and duration, leading to death in many animals. Treatment started after onset of EAE shortened the disease. Forty seven days after immunization, extensive demyelination and inflammation were observed in the spinal cords of rats treated with FK 506 from the day of EAE induction. Rats treated after EAE onset had only minimal pathological abnormalities.
Prior research suggests that sex hormones and metabolic changes, such as obesity and hyperglycemia, can alter renal transporter expression in rodents. The purpose of this study was to characterize the expression of kidney efflux transporters and regulatory transcription factors in response to Type I diabetes and pregnancy. Female C57BL/6 mice were treated with multiple low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce hyperglycemia and then mated with normoglycemic male mice. Transporter mRNA and protein expression were quantified in kidneys from vehicle- and STZ-treated non-pregnant and pregnant mice on gestation day 14. Pregnancy decreased the expression of Mdr1b, Mrp4, and 5 proteins and increased the mRNA and protein expression of Mrp3 by 50-60%. STZ treatment elevated Mrp1, 2, 4, and 5 and reduced Mrp3, 6, and Mdr1b mRNA and/or protein in non-pregnant mice. Pregnancy had little effect on STZ-mediated changes in renal efflux transporter expression. Transcriptional profiles of Hnf1α, PXR, AhR, and Nrf2 were altered in patterns similar to some efflux transporters suggesting potential involvement in their regulation. Taken together, these results suggest that renal drug efflux transporters and regulatory signaling pathways are altered by endocrine and metabolic changes that occur during pregnancy and Type I diabetes.
A 55-year-old man was admitted because of cholestatic jaundice. Extrahepatic obstruction and viral causes were excluded. A diagnosis of liver damage due to the combination preparation amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (Augmentin) was made. The patient had an uneventful recovery. It is pointed out that in case of cholestatic jaundice drug-induced cholestasis should be suspected early in the course. History taking is an important tool. If a suspected drug is found other causes of the disease can be excluded with simple tests.
The antitumoral activity of 13-demethyl or 13-substituted all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9-cis retinoic acid (9CRA) was tested using the myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. Cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assay. The ability to bind to human RXRalpha and to activate either human retinoic acid response element (RARE)-mediated gene expression or rat CRABPII retinoid X response element (RXRalpha)-mediated gene expression were determined using luciferase reporter plasmids. In terms of the magnitude of the regulatory activity for the proliferation and differentiation of HL-60 cells, the compounds ranked as follows: ATRA>13-ethyl ATRA>13-demethyl ATRA>13-phenylethyl ATRA>13-propyl ATRA>13-butyl ATRA (ATRA analogues) and 9CRA>13-ethyl 9CRA>13-demethyl 9CRA>13-propyl 9CRA>13-phenetyl 9CRA>13-butyl 9CRA (9CRA analogues). Regarding the magnitude of the apoptosis-inducing activity, the order was: 9CRA>13-ethyl 9CRA>13-demethyl 9CRA, with ATRA and its analogues and the other 9CRA analogues virtually inactive. Similar trends were observed in binding affinity for RXRalpha and transactivation activity toward RARE- or RXRE-mediated gene expression. The results clearly indicate that the presence of a methyl group at C-13 is essential for the antitumoral activity of ATRA and 9CRA, and that bulky substituents exceeding two carbon atoms or the absence of substitution at position 13 significantly reduce the binding affinity for RAR and RXR, leading to a decreased RAR/RARE and/or RXR/RXRE-mediated gene expression.
Systemic (IP) and/or intraseptal (IS) administration of scopolamine (SCP) and diazepam (DZP) induce amnesia, whereas IP injection of the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and choline chloride (ChCl) produce memory facilitation. The septohippocampal cholinergic system has been pointed out as a possible site of SCP and DZP-induced amnesia as well as for the mnemonic effects induced by SP and ChCl. We performed a series of experiments in order to investigate the interactions between cholinergic and GABA/benzodiazepine (GABA/BZD) systems with the SPergic system on inhibitory avoidance retention. Male Wistar rats were trained and tested in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task (1.0 mA footshock). Animals received, pre-training, IP (1.0 mg/kg) or IS (1.0 nM/0.5 microl) injection of DZP, SCP (SCP; 1.0 mg/kg - IP or 0.5 microM/0.5 microl--IS) or vehicle (VEH). Immediately after training they received an IP or IS injections of SP 1-11 (50 microg/kg--IP or 1.0 nM/0.5 microl--IS), SP 1-7 (167 microg/kg--IP or 1.0 nM/0.5 microl--IS), ChCl (20 mg/kg--IP or 0.3 microM/0.5 microl--IS) or VEH. Rats pretreated with SCP and DZP showed amnesia. Post-trial treatments with SP 1-11, SP 1-7 or ChCl blocked the amnesic effects of SCP and DZP. These findings suggest an interaction between SPergic and cholinergic mechanisms with GABAergic systems in the modulation of inhibitory avoidance retention and that the effects of these treatments are mediated, at least in part, by interactions in the septohippocampal pathway.
The objective of our study was to determine whether angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) gains correlated with vertigo control after intratympanic gentamicin treatment for Meniere's disease.
We conducted a prospective study of 18 subjects with unilateral Meniere's disease treated with intratympanic gentamicin injection and followed all subjects for 1 year. We measured the gain of the aVOR elicited by rapid rotary head thrusts in each of the canal planes for each subject before and after treatment with intratympanic gentamicin by using magnetic search coils to record eye movements.
During the follow-up period, 11 subjects ("single-treatment group"; 61%) had control of their vertigo with a single gentamicin injection. The remaining 7 subjects ("multiple-treatment group"; 39%) experienced recurrent vertigo that required a second injection of gentamicin at a mean of 6 months after the first treatment. The 11 subjects in the single-treatment group had significantly greater reduction of labyrinthine function after the first treatment, as measured by change in ipsilateral horizontal canal gain, than did the 7 subjects with vertigo recurrence. Changes in caloric asymmetry did not correlate with vertigo control.
Our results suggest that successful treatment of Meniere's disease is closely related to attenuation of semicircular canal function as measured by horizontal canal aVOR gains.
Proteinuria is a common complication occurring after kidney transplantation. It is associated with an increased risk of renal failure and patient death. Treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists (blockers) has been shown to reduce proteinuria after kidney transplantation, as well as improve both graft and patient survival. An increase in proteinuria has been observed in some patients after initiation of sirolimus therapy. Although the mechanism of this remains unclear, high proteinuria at baseline and poor renal function at baseline have been identified as potential risk factors for the development of proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus. Initiation of sirolimus therapy is not recommended in patients with early histological indicators of glomerular damage; however, in patients with healthy grafts, sirolimus may prevent future glomerulosclerosis. Early treatment with an ACE inhibitor and sirolimus, prior to the appearance of glomerular changes, may result in better outcomes.
Arterial vasodilatation was obtained by a slow injection of nicardipine (0.1 microgram/20 min) to normotensive Long Evans rats. Reflex tachycardia was a consequence of a sympathetic activation as labetalol injected prior to nicardipine prevented the calcium antagonist-induced heart rate changes. The slope of the mean blood pressure (mmHg) - heart period (msec) curve was reproducible after a 75 min interval. This index of baroreflex sensitivity was calculated before and after a transient cerebral ischemia. Hemispheric ischemia was induced by electrocauterization of the vertebral arteries and a transient occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 10 min. Brainstem perfusion was maintained with this protocol. The second dose of nicardipine was injected 15 min after recirculation. The tachycardic response to the vasodilatation was markedly reduced after ischemia (1st slope: 0.48 +/- 0.05 msec/mmHg, 2nd slope: 0.12 +/- 0.05 msec/mmHg, n = 12, p less than 0.001, paired t test). We conclude that nicardipine injection is applicable to the study of baroreflex sensitivity in rats. The impairment of baroreflex sensitivity after a transient hemispheric ischemia could reflect a hemispheric interference with brainstem cardiovascular centres involved in the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex.
Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic terminal damage. In this study, we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide, a pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factor, treatment in modulating the methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity. Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine-elicited hyperthermia three days later. Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose-dependent manner. As the most potent dose (1 mg/kg) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks, one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen, methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered. Moreover, systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment (1 mg/kg) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion-produced dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum, indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine. We concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity.
We report a case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-associated glomerulonephritis treated with antibiotic therapy. A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of proteinuria, hematuria, purpura, and high fever one month after a graft replacement of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. MRSA was detected in specimens of his blood, sputum, and joint fluid. Before his operation, he had shown no renal abnormalities. He presented with a rapid deterioration of renal function following MRSA infection. Maximum level of proteinuria was 1.5 g/day, serum creatinine (Cr) was 3.5 mg/dl, and blood urea nitrogen was 57 mg/dl. Renal biopsy revealed necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescence examination showed IgA and C3 deposits. Clinical and pathological examinations showed the typical features of MRSA-associated glomerulonephritis. Vancomycin and fosfomycin were administered intravenously. The serum level of C-reactive protein fell from 22.0 mg/dl to 0.1 mg/dl. Proteinuria also decreased and the patient's renal function improved in parallel with the decreased activity of MRSA infection. After three months of antibiotic treatment, proteinuria was negative and the level of serum Cr had dropped to 0.9 mg/dl. These findings suggest that antibiotic treatment can lead to complete remission of MRSA-associated glomerulonephritis.
We examined the hypothesis that the dopamine D3 receptor gene (DRD3) is a susceptibility factor for cocaine dependence. The MscI/BalI polymorphism of the DRD3 gene was examined in 47 Caucasian subjects with cocaine dependence and 305 Caucasian controls. Based on prior studies with a range of psychiatric disorders we hypothesized there would be a decrease in the frequency of the 12 genotype in the patient sample (increased homozygosity). We observed a significant decrease in the frequency of 12 heterozygotes in subjects with cocaine dependence (29.8%) vs controls (46.9%) (P </= 0.028). This percentage was still lower in those who had chronically used cocaine for more than 10 years (25%), or more than 15 years (21.5%). The DRD3 gene accounted for 1.64% of the variance of cocaine dependence. The DRD2 gene had an independent and additive effect on cocaine dependence. These findings support a modest role of the DRD3 gene in susceptibility to cocaine dependence.
In an open, non-comparative, variable-dose study, 20 outpatients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were treated with 5-10 mg amlodipine once daily for 4 weeks, after their blood pressures had stabilized on placebo. Amlodipine produced a significant decrease in blood pressure (P < 0.05) from the initial mean of 162/100 mm Hg to 139/85 mm Hg at 4 weeks. 80% of the patients reached the goal diastolic blood pressure of < or = 90 mm Hg with a once-daily dose of 5 mg amlodipine within 2 weeks. The remaining 20% also attained the goal diastolic blood pressure within 4 weeks, with a one-step increase in the dose to 10 mg at 2 weeks. Amlodipine maintained blood pressure reduction throughout the 24-hours dosing interval with a once-daily dose. Notably, no side effects were observed; pulse rate, electrocardiogram, and laboratory parameters were not significantly altered with therapy. Amlodipine in a single daily dose of 5-10 mg is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
