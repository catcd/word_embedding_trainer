Access to specialty alcoholism treatment in rural environments is limited and new treatment approaches are needed. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of naltrexone alone and in combination with sertraline among Alaska Natives and other Alaskans living in rural settings. An exploratory aim examined whether the Asn40Asp polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) predicted response to naltrexone, as had been reported in Caucasians.
Randomized, controlled trial enrolling 101 Alaskans with alcohol dependence, including 68 American Indians/Alaska Natives. Participants received 16 weeks of either (1) placebo (placebo naltrexone + placebo sertraline), (2) naltrexone monotherapy (50 mg naltrexone + sertraline placebo) and (3) naltrexone + sertraline (100 mg) plus nine sessions of medical management and supportive advice. Primary outcomes included Time to First Heavy Drinking Day and Total Abstinence.
Naltrexone monotherapy demonstrated significantly higher total abstinence (35%) compared with placebo (12%, p = 0027) and longer, but not statistically different, Time to First Heavy Drinking Day (p = 0.093). On secondary measures, naltrexone compared with placebo demonstrated significant improvements in percent days abstinent (p = 0.024) and drinking-related consequences (p = 0.02). Combined sertraline and naltrexone did not differ from naltrexone alone. The pattern of findings was generally similar for the American Indian/Alaska Native subsample. Naltrexone treatment response was significant within the group of 75 individuals who were homozygous for OPRM1 Asn40 allele. There was a small number of Asp40 carriers, precluding statistical testing of the effect of this allele on response.
Naltrexone can be used effectively to treat alcoholism in remote and rural communities, with evidence of benefit for American Indians and Alaska Natives. New models of care incorporating pharmacotherapy could reduce important health disparities related to alcoholism.
To assess the effect of triamcinolone acetonide over 3 months on hard exudates in patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO).
Thirty-two eyes of 16 patients with DMO and hard exudates were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Treated eyes received a single-dose (4 mg) intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide. Control eyes received an injection of subconjunctival saline.
The overall area of hard exudates decreased significantly between the baseline and 3-month visits in treated eyes, but not in control eyes. The mean change in level of hard exudates between the two visits was -0.75 arbitrary units (AU) (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.32 to -0.18) in the central plus inner circle (1500 microm) and -0.81 AU (95% CI -1.49 to -0.13) over the whole grid (3000 microm) in treated eyes, compared with 0.31 AU (95% CI -0.19 to 0.82) and 0.31 AU (95% CI -0.11 to 0.74), respectively, in control eyes (p < 0.001). Mean visual acuity improved by five letters in treated but not in control eyes (p = 0.01).
Intravitreal triamcinolone reduces hard exudates in the short-term in eyes with DMO.
We previously examined the early postnatal maturation of the primary afferent auditory nerve projections from the cat cochlear spiral ganglion (SG) to the cochlear nucleus (CN). In normal kittens these projections exhibit clear cochleotopic organization before birth, but quantitative data showed that their topographic specificity is less precise in perinatal kittens than in adults. Normalized for CN size, projections to the anteroventral (AVCN), posteroventral (PVCN), and dorsal (DCN) subdivisions are all significantly broader in neonates than in adults. By 6-7 postnatal days, projections are proportionate to those of adults, suggesting that significant refinement occurs during the early postnatal period. The present study examined SG projections to the CN in adult cats deafened as neonates by ototoxic drug administration. The fundamental organization of the SG-to-CN projections into frequency band laminae is clearly evident despite severe auditory deprivation from birth. However, when normalized for the smaller CN size in deafened animals, projections are disproportionately broader than in controls; AVCN, PVCN, and DCN projections are 39, 26, and 48% broader, respectively, than predicted if they were precisely proportionate to projections in normal hearing animals. These findings suggest that normal auditory experience and neural activity are essential for the early postnatal development (or subsequent maintenance) of the topographic precision of SG-to-CN projections. After early deafness, the basic cochleotopic organization of the CN is established and maintained into adulthood, but the CN is severely reduced in size and the topographic specificity of primary afferent projections that underlies frequency resolution in the normal central auditory system is significantly degraded.
Serum alpha1-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration in 5-week-old rats was measured by the radioimmunoassay technique after a single administration of various hepatotoxins. Marked elevation of serum AFP concentrations occurred in rats treated with carbon tetrachloride, thioacetamide, D-galactosamine, allyl alcohol, allyl formate, and ethionine in 4 days of these treatments. The increased production of AFP appeared to be correlated with the induction of liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) among biochemical parameters studied for hepatocellular injuries. However, the difference in time courses of the increase in liver G-6-PD activity and serum AFP level following CC14 treatment suggested that the increased production of serum AFP and the induction of G-6-PD in injured liver were caused by closely related but different mechanisms. Pretreatment of CC14-injured rats with N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine or aminoacetonitrile was effective not only in lowering the increased level of serum AFP and liver G-6-PD but also in preventing liver cell necrosis and steatosis induced by CC14. Treatment with a lower dose of thioacetamide resulted in littel elevation of serum AFP and liver G-6-PD with a markedly increased incorporation of 3H-thymidine into liver DNA without any evidence of liver injury. On the other hand, the administration of ethionine, which caused little necrosis of liver cells, produced increase in both serum AFP and liver G-6-PD levels with an only small increase of hepatic DNA synthesis compared to those following thioacetamide as well as CC14. These results suggest that the elevation of serum AFP is not directly related to the stimulation of hepatic DNA synthesis. Some additional mechanisms of specific gene amplification for AFP, which is geared to hepatic injury per se, appear to play a major role in the increased AFP production in injured liver.
Biochemical and neuropathological effects of exposure to a high dose regimen of methamphetamine were evaluated in rhesus monkeys approximately 4 years after the last drug injection. Concentrations of dopamine and serotonin in caudate were below control levels as were concentrations of serotonin in several other brain regions. These changes were more severe in a monkey that was exposed twice to the drug regimen. A decrease in caudate synaptosomal uptake of both neurotransmitters as well as neuropathological changes were evident in that monkey. Although it is possible that partial recovery occurred, these results strongly suggest that methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity may be permanent.
Hiccups occurring secondary to high-doses of corticosteroids are a well-recognized problem in the field of neurosurgery. Numerous reports of oral, intravenous and intraarticular corticosteroids inducing hiccups exist in the literature. To date, there is only one case of anabolic steroids inducing hiccups. We now present a case of a patient who underwent a suboccipital craniotomy for resection of a cerebellar pontine angle meningioma. Postoperatively the patient was on high doses of Decadron and Oxandrin, an anabolic-anticatabolic agent used to combat the deleterious effects of corticosteroids. The patient suffered intractable hiccups postoperative day one, resistant to Thorazine. Oxandrin was discontinued to assess the possibility of a anabolic steroid-induced singultus. The hiccups resolved within 24 hours. This report validates the previous report on anabolic steroids inducing hiccups and exemplifies the ability for steroids as a class, due to there backbone structural homology, to induce function even as competitive inhibitors.
The newborn with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is at high risk of developing persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Recently, smooth muscle K(+) channels have been implicated in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in adults. We hypothesized that the hyperreactivity of the newborn pulmonary vasculature in CDH might reflect a relatively low level of smooth muscle K(+) channel activity because of hypoxemia, which could give rise to excessive smooth muscle cell depolarisation and lead to failure of the pulmonary vasculature to adapt to extrauterine life. We therefore investigated K(+) channel subunits in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) in the nitrofen-induced CDH lung in rats. The CDH model was induced in pregnant rats after administration of 100 mg nitrofen on day 9.5 of gestation (term = 22 days). Dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg) was given on days 18.5 and 19.5 of gestation. Cesarean section was performed on day 21. Fetuses were divided into three groups: group I, normal control; group II, nitrofen-induced CDH; and group III, nitrofen-induced CDH with antenatal dexamethasone treatment. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the relative amount of the potassium channels Kv1.2, Kv2.1, and KvCa mRNA. Indirect immunohistochemistry was performed using a laser scanning confocal microscope with anti-Kv1.2, -Kv2.1, and -KvCa antibodies. In the CDH lung, Kv1.2, Kv2.1, and KvCa immunoreactivity was markedly decreased in PASMC compared with controls. Relative mRNA levels of potassium channel anti-Kv1.2, -Kv2.1, and -KvCa were significantly decreased in the CDH lung compared with controls (p<0.05). Dexamethasone treatment increased Kv1.2, Kv2.1, and KvCa immunoreactivity and mRNA levels in the CDH lung. Changes in voltage-gate K(+) channel subunits expression in the CDH lung suggest that potassium channels may play an important role in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Antenatal dexamethasone may modulate pulmonary vascular tone in the CDH hypoplastic lung by selectively upregulating local expression of Kv1.2, Kv2.1, and KvCa.
Venomous animals from distinct phyla such as spiders, scorpions, snakes, cone snails, or sea anemones produce small toxic proteins interacting with a variety of cell targets. Their bites often cause pain. One of the ways of pain generation is the activation of TRPV1 channels. Screening of 30 different venoms from spiders and sea anemones for modulation of TRPV1 activity revealed inhibitors in tropical sea anemone Heteractis crispa venom. Several separation steps resulted in isolation of an inhibiting compound. This is a 56-residue-long polypeptide named APHC1 that has a Bos taurus trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)/Kunitz-type fold, mostly represented by serine protease inhibitors and ion channel blockers. APHC1 acted as a partial antagonist of capsaicin-induced currents (32 +/- 9% inhibition) with half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) 54 +/- 4 nm. In vivo, a 0.1 mg/kg dose of APHC1 significantly prolonged tail-flick latency and reduced capsaicin-induced acute pain. Therefore, our results can make an important contribution to the research into molecular mechanisms of TRPV1 modulation and help to solve the problem of overactivity of this receptor during a number of pathological processes in the organism.
A questionnaire was sent to principal investigators of NIH-sponsored clinical research in sickle cell disease. Twenty of 21 respondents indicated they used parenteral narcotic analgesics for pain episodes sufficiently severe to warrant hospitalization. Eleven used meperidine; seven, morphine; and one each, nalbuphine, hydromorphone, and acetaminophen with codeine. They gave the agents at frequent, regular intervals or by continuous infusion. A total of 41 of more than 3,500 patients required chronic transfusion for pain control. Complications included meperidine-associated convulsions reported by nine respondents and addiction by six. This information indicates that vigorous pain-control methods are used at institutions having a special interest in providing medical care for children with sickle cell disease.
A 38-year-old white female, hepatitis B antigen negative, developed fluminating hepatic failure associated with oliguria and severe azotemia after two halothane anesthesia and without exposure to other hepatotoxic drugs or blood transfusions. She was treated with multiple hemodialysis and exchange blood transfusion. The combined treatment corrected the uremic abnormalities and improved her level of consciousness. the liver and kidney function gradually improved, and she made a complete recovery, the first recorded with hepatic and renal failure under these postanesthetic conditions. Further evaluation of this combined treatment used for this patient is warranted.
The case report presented here describes a situation in which diplopia resulted as an effect secondary to maxillary infiltration anesthesia. Prior cases and theories regarding the mechanisms involved are reviewed, and a new theory explaining this phenomenon is proposed. The autonomic nervous system is presented as the logical basis for the untoward systems, rather than simple circulation of anesthetic solution in the vascular tree.
We studied 51 pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were initially treated with pyrazinamide (PZA) at our hospital between April 1996 and December 1997. PZA dosage was less than 1.5 g per day, and the chemotherapy course lasted 2 months. Uric acid levels of higher than 8 mg/dl were observed in 44 patients (86%). Arthralgia was observed in 9 patients. Acute gout was observed in only 1 patient who had hyperuricemia prior to PZA treatment and a predisposition for gout. The other 8 patients with arthralgia had symptoms in the shoulders and knees, but no gouty pain. Arthralgia was not related to serum uric acid level and disappeared after PZA treatment was stopped. We concluded that PZA can be used for up to 2 months without the combined administration of allopurinol or benzbromarone even if hyperuricemia or arthralgia develops.
A 52-year-old female patient presented at our hospital with right upper abdominal pain and impaired general condition. During the previous 7 months, the patient had received anticoagulation treatment with phenprocoumon due to a prosthetic aortic valve replacement.
Serological tests for virologic, autoimmune or metabolic causes of hepatitis were negative. The histologic examination of liver biopsies showed necrotizing hepatocellular injury in zone 3 of the acinus without relevant fibrosis. Initially, a lymphocyte transformation test with phenprocoumon was negative. A second test after one week turned out to be positive. DIAGNOSIS AND CLINICAL COURSE: After withdrawal from phenprocoumon therapy and switching to anticoagulation with a low molecular weight heparin, liver tests gradually became normal. Aminotransferase levels rapidly increased when phenprocoumon treatment was resumed. Phenprocoumon-associated necrotizing hepatitis was diagnosed by clinical course, liver histology and the positive lymphocyte transformation test. After immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone was started again, liver enzymes gradually normalized. Anticoagulation was further performed with low molecular weight heparin.
This case stresses the fact that an adequate and detailed history on concomitant medication is mandatory in patients who present with cryptic hepatitis. Though severe hepatic adverse effects of phenprocoumon are rare, physicians should consider coumarin derivatives as a potential source of hepatitis.
Structural variation (copy number variation [CNV] including deletion and duplication, translocation, inversion) of chromosomes has been identified in some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the full etiologic role is unknown. We performed genome-wide assessment for structural abnormalities in 427 unrelated ASD cases via single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and karyotyping. With microarrays, we discovered 277 unbalanced CNVs in 44% of ASD families not present in 500 controls (and re-examined in another 1152 controls). Karyotyping detected additional balanced changes. Although most variants were inherited, we found a total of 27 cases with de novo alterations, and in three (11%) of these individuals, two or more new variants were observed. De novo CNVs were found in approximately 7% and approximately 2% of idiopathic families having one child, or two or more ASD siblings, respectively. We also detected 13 loci with recurrent/overlapping CNV in unrelated cases, and at these sites, deletions and duplications affecting the same gene(s) in different individuals and sometimes in asymptomatic carriers were also found. Notwithstanding complexities, our results further implicate the SHANK3-NLGN4-NRXN1 postsynaptic density genes and also identify novel loci at DPP6-DPP10-PCDH9 (synapse complex), ANKRD11, DPYD, PTCHD1, 15q24, among others, for a role in ASD susceptibility. Our most compelling result discovered CNV at 16p11.2 (p = 0.002) (with characteristics of a genomic disorder) at approximately 1% frequency. Some of the ASD regions were also common to mental retardation loci. Structural variants were found in sufficiently high frequency influencing ASD to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses be considered in routine clinical workup.
Urapidil is a peripheral postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with central agonistic action at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. It reduces blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. Oral urapidil decreases blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and associated risk factors such as hyperlipidaemia or type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus with no effect on heart rate. The antihypertensive efficacy of urapidil is similar to that of most comparators in patients with mild to moderate essential or secondary hypertension and no concomitant risk factors. However, the antihypertensive efficacy of urapidil was lower than that of hydrochlorothiazide in a well designed trial. Lipid levels and glucose metabolism are not adversely affected and may improve with urapidil in patients with lipid or glucose abnormalities. Urapidil can be safely combined with other antihypertensive agents such as hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine and improves blood pressure control in previous nonresponders to monotherapy. Intravenous urapidil reduces blood pressure in patients with pre-eclampsia or hypertension in pregnancy and in patients with hypertensive crises or peri- or postoperative hypertension. The decrease in blood pressure is similar to that observed after nifedipine, enalaprilat, sodium nitroprusside and dihydralazine, greater than that of ketanserin according to 1 larger study, and greater than that of sublingual nitroglycerin in 1 trial in patients with nonsurgical hypertensive crises and pulmonary oedema. However, more patients responded to treatment with urapidil than with enalaprilat or nifedipine. Heart rate is less likely to be altered by urapidil than with some comparator drugs. Urapidil appears to be well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild and transient. The incidence of adverse events with urapidil is similar to that with prazosin, metoprolol, atenolol, sodium nitroprusside and hydrochlorothiazide and less than that with nifedipine and clonidine. Urapidil may not be as well tolerated as captopril and, in 1 study, more urapidil than nitrendipine recipients discontinued treatment because of adverse events.
urapidil reduces blood pressure without altering heart rate. The oral formulation is an effective choice in patients with hypertension and concomitant dyslipidaemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus, in whom the drug does not adversely affect and may improve lipid profiles and glucose metabolism. The intravenous formulation is effective in controlling various hypertensive crises and hypertension associated with pregnancy or surgery and is similar to or better than other first-line agents used in these conditions. Thus, urapidil may be a useful alternative to currently available antihypertensive agents.
Administration of benzene to mice causes bone marrow toxicity and elevations in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a negative regulator of myelopoiesis. In these experiments, benzene (400 mg/kg; 2 x/day for 2 days) administered to DBA/2 or C57Bl/6 mice decreased bone marrow cellularity and myeloid progenitor cell development (measured as colony-forming units per femur) by 40%. When inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase component of prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) (either indomethacin, 2 mg/kg; aspirin, 50 mg/kg; meclofenamate, 4 mg/kg) were coadministered with benzene, myelotoxicity and the elevation in bone marrow PGE level were prevented. Additionally, when indomethacin (1 microM) was added to cultures of bone marrow cells from benzene-treated mice, myeloid progenitor cell development was the same as the controls. The doses of indomethacin used had no affect on the hepatic conversion of benzene to its major metabolite, phenol. Using purified PHS, indomethacin (10 microM) inhibited the arachidonic acid-dependent oxidation of hydroquinone to p-benzoquinone, a putative reactive metabolite of benzene. Indomethacin (10 microM) had no effect on the H2O2-driven oxidation of hydroquinone catalysed by either PHS-peroxidase or myeloperoxidase. Coadministration of the benzene metabolites, phenol and hydroquinone, has been reported previously to reproduce the myelotoxicity of benzene. In our studies, phenol and hydroquinone (50 mg/kg each; 2 x/day for 2 days) decreased bone marrow cellularity by 40%; however, coadministration of indomethacin (2 mg/kg) or meclofenamate (4 mg/kg) with these metabolites did not prevent the decrease in bone marrow cell number. Our results implicate marrow PHS in mediating the short-term myelotoxicity of benzene.
The treatment of the painful osteomyelitis in patients with SAPHO syndrome (Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, Osteitis) is often a problem. A 53-year-old woman had experienced palmo-plantar pustular skin lesions for four years, and in the past two years complained about progressive breath-and movement-dependent pain of the sternum. On examination she had extensive palmoplantar pustules and a painful swelling in the area of the right sternoclavicular joint. The three-phase bone scintigraphy showed a strong focal enrichment in the right sternoclavicular joint and at the transition from the manubrium to the corpus sterni suggesting active osteo-chondritis. Initially prednisolone and ibuprofen were administered, but only the skin changes regressed. The strong sternal pain decreased only after infusion of 4 mg zoledronic acid over three days. In a follow-up examination after five months the patient was still free of pain. The bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic activity and lead to long-lasting improvement of osteo-articular complaints in the SAPHO syndrome.
Resveratrol (RES) is a phytoestrogen that has the ability to bind to estrogen receptors (ERs) and evoke biological effects that parallel those exerted by endogenous and synthetic estrogens. We have shown in previous studies that adult female rats acutely exposed to RES exhibit estrous cycle irregularity, ovarian hypertrophy, and alterations in sociosexual behavior. The present experiment characterizes the prolonged effects of maternal RES exposure throughout the lactational period on subsequent behavior, reproductive tissues, and brain morphology of the adult offspring. During adulthood, female offspring exposed to RES throughout nursing exhibited reduced body weight and increased ovarian weight, but exhibited normal estrous cyclicity and sociosexual behavior, without changes in the volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area or the anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. During adulthood, males exposed to RES throughout nursing exhibited decreased body weight and plasma testosterone concentration, increased testicular weight, and reduced sociosexual behavior. These males also had significantly smaller sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area volumes and larger anteroventral periventricular nucleus volumes compared to male controls. These data suggest that postnatal exposure to RES may affect estrogenic activity in specific peripheral tissues (e.g., the gonads), while inducing antiestrogenic effects in the brain. Thus, the present study supports recent in vitro and in vivo findings that RES differs from most other phytoestrogens by acting as a possible mixed ER agonist/antagonist, depending on the tissue-specific availability of ER subtypes that are preferentially localized in specific brain regions and throughout the reproductive tract. More importantly these data indicate that maternal consumption of phytoestrogens during lactation can have lasting effects on the offspring that may not become apparent until they reach adulthood.
This analysis evaluated the tolerability profile of quetiapine using data from all comparative controlled studies in patients with schizophrenia or related disorders in the AstraZeneca clinical trials database, focusing on extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).
Adverse event (AE) data from randomised, double-blind, controlled studies in the AstraZeneca clinical trials database were pooled, allowing comparison of quetiapine (mean daily doses 357-496 mg/day) with placebo, haloperidol (10.4 mg/day), risperidone (5.5 mg/day) or chlorpromazine (552 mg/day). Incidence of EPS-related AEs in relation to quetiapine dose was also analysed using a subset of data from fixed-dose studies.
Data from 4956 patients were analysed. Quetiapine was well tolerated, and did not increase EPS-related AEs when compared with placebo (9.6 vs. 10.6%, respectively). The incidence of EPS-related AEs with quetiapine was consistent across the dose range (4.2-13.2% vs. 11.1% with placebo). Patients receiving haloperidol, risperidone and chlorpromazine experienced significantly higher levels of EPS-related AEs than those on quetiapine. The most common quetiapine- associated AEs, with significantly higher incidence than placebo, were sedation, somnolence and orthostatic hypotension.
Quetiapine is generally well tolerated in patients with schizophrenia or related disorders, with placebo-level EPS-related AEs. Quetiapine has a more favourable EPS profile than haloperidol, chlorpromazine or risperidone.
The alpha1-adrenoceptor-blocking antihypertensive doxazosin has been associated with increased risk of heart failure and is known to induce prostate cell apoptosis. We hypothesized that it might also induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.
Hoechst dye vital staining and flow cytometry provided evidence that doxazosin induced apoptosis time- and dose-dependently in cardiomyocytes of the HL-1 cell line. TUNEL assays and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability test confirmed that doxazosin induced DNA damage and cell death in these cells. MTT tests showed that doxazosin treatment decreased cell viability in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and Hoechst dye vital staining demonstrated doxazosin-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of human adult cardiomyocytes. The proapoptotic effect of doxazosin on cardiomyocytes seems not to depend on alpha1 blockade, because it was not modified by cotreatment with alpha- or beta-adrenergic agonists or with the irreversible alpha1-blocker phenoxybenzamine and because doxazosin also decreased the viability of NIH 3T3 cells, which lack alpha1-adrenoceptors. It also does not involve calcineurin, being unaffected by the presence of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506. Three other alpha1-blockers were also investigated; prazosin was proapoptotic, like doxazosin, but 5-methylurapidil and terazosin were not.
The alpha1-blockers doxazosin and prazosin induce the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes cultured in vitro by a mechanism that is independent of alpha1 blockade and calcineurin.
Rats anaesthetized with pentobarbital and ventilated artificially were infused with 0.15 mg/kg/min. verapamil; without antidotal treatment, they died after 51.1+/-7.1 min. The survival time more than trebled upon an additional infusion with calcium chloride, epinephrine, isoprenaline, orciprenaline or prenalterol and nearly doubled upon administration of a plasma expander. It was not increased, however, by treatment with angiotensin or atropine. The infusion of verapamil declined the arterial blood pressure by 75%, and heart rate, cardiac output and peripheral resistance by about 50%; in the ECG, sinus bradycardia followed by AV-dissociation with nodal rhythm occurred. All antidotes that raised the lethal dose of verapamil increased the cardiac output. Calcium and the sympathomimetics with alpha-adrenergic activity also counteracted the verapamil-induced hypotension. Calcium did not influence the ECG alterations produced by verapamil, while the sympathomimetics restored the sinus rhythm or accelerated the nodal pacemaker. Calcium, epinephrine and isoprenaline also antagonized the strong decrease of left-ventricular dp/dt max. induced by verapamil. In conclusion, calcium as well as sympathomimetic amines are potent antidotes against the cardiovascular toxicity of verapamil, the latter being superior to calcium in their ability to improve pacemaker activity and AV-conduction.
A child with massive hematuria, produced by cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, was treated with open bladder instillation of formalin. To prevent vesicoureteral reflux, we inserted two Fogarty catheters. Intraoperative retrograde cystography was made to confirm that there was no reflux, extravasation or passage of contrast per urethra. The postoperative result was good with cessation of hematuria.
Diphenylhydantoin (DPH), a common anticonvulsant drug, is known to produce anomalies in the craniofacial region of animals and humans. We hypothesize that phenytoin disrupts craniofacial morphogenesis by inhibiting the arachidonic acid cascade; a pathogenesis already demonstrated for glucocorticoids and hyperglycemia. This hypothesis was tested in vitro by administering DPH, with and without the addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA), to murine embryos. Forty-five 8.7-day-old embryos were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, DPH, or DPH plus AA. After 48 hours in culture, all specimens were examined at 6x magnification for defects in the facial arches, head fold, and neural tube fusion. The DPH-treated specimens had a significantly greater (P less than or equal to .05) number of anomalies in each of the three anatomical areas than did the controls. Specimens cultured in DPH plus AA had significantly fewer defects in each of the three features than those treated with DPH alone. These data support the hypothesis that phenytoin disrupts normal embryonic development through interruption of the arachidonic acid cascade. Furthermore, removal of the visceral yolk sac from 50% of the specimens in control and treatment groups provided evidence that the drug had a direct effect on the embryos rather than secondary to yolk sac involvement as has been suggested in the literature.
SIRT1 (mammalian ortholog of the yeast silent information regulator 2) is a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase belonging to the multigene family of sirtuins. Anecdotal and epidemiologic observations provide evidence for beneficial effects of the calorie restriction mimetic resveratrol (RES), a SIRT1 activator in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Although SIRT1 possesses both tumorigenic and antitumorigenic potential, the molecular mechanisms underlying SIRT1-mediated tumor progression or inhibition are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of SIRT1 in multiple human prostate cancer cell lines and prostate-specific PTEN knockout mouse model using resveratrol. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (C42B, PC3, and DU145) express higher levels of SIRT1 than androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and nontumorigenic prostate cells (RWPE-1). Resveratrol enhanced this expression without any significant effect on SIRT1 enzymatic activity. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression using shRNA enhanced cell proliferation and inhibited autophagy by repressing phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1. These biologic correlates were reversed in the presence of resveratrol. Analysis of prostates from dietary intervention with resveratrol showed a significant reduction in prostate weight and reduction in the incidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic (HGPIN) lesions by approximately 54% with no significant change in body weight. Consistent with the in vitro findings, resveratrol intervention in the PTEN knockout mouse model was associated with reduction in the prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1. These data suggest that SIRT1/S6K-mediated inhibition of autophagy drives prostate tumorigenesis. Therefore, modulation of SIRT1/S6K signaling represents an effective strategy for prostate cancer prevention.
A prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine (ZDV)-induced bone marrow suppression. Seventy-five human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 500/mm3 were randomized to receive either ZDV (500 mg daily) alone (group I, n = 38) or in combination with folinic acid (15 mg daily) and intramascular vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms monthly) (group II, n = 37). Finally, 15 patients were excluded from the study (noncompliance 14, death 1); thus, 60 patients (31 in group I and 29 in group II) were eligible for analysis. No significant differences between groups were found at enrollment. During the study, vitamin B12 and folate levels were significantly higher in group II patients; however, no differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and white-cell, neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Severe hematologic toxicity (neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 and/or hemoglobin < 8 g/dl) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group I and 7 assigned to group II. There was no correlation between vitamin B12 or folate levels and development of myelosuppression. Vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation of ZDV therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing ZDV-induced myelotoxicity in the overall treated population, although a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients cannot be excluded.
Parental exposure to pesticides may contribute to childhood cancer risk. Through the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective study of pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina, we examined childhood cancer risk and associations with parental pesticide application. Identifying information for 17,357 children of Iowa pesticide applicators was provided by parents via questionnaires (1993-1997) and matched against the Iowa Cancer Registry. Fifty incident childhood cancers were identified (1975-1998). Risk of all childhood cancers combined was increased [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.79]. Risk of all lymphomas combined was also increased (SIR = 2.18; 95% CI, 1.13-4.19), as was risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR = 2.56; 95% CI, 1.06-6.14). We used logistic regression to explore associations between self-reported parental pesticide application practices and childhood cancer risk. No association was detected between frequency of parental pesticide application and childhood cancer risk. An increased risk of cancer was detected among children whose fathers did not use chemically resistant gloves [odds ratio (OR) = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.05-3.76] compared with children whose fathers used gloves. Of 16 specific pesticides used by fathers prenatally, ORs were increased for aldrin (OR = 2.66), dichlorvos (OR = 2.06), and ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (OR = 1.91). However, these results were based on small numbers and not supported by prior biologic evidence. Identification of excess lymphoma risk suggests that farm exposures including pesticides may play a role in the etiology of childhood lymphoma.
