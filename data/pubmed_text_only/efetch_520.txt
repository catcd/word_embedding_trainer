The combined administration of enoxacin, a new quinolone, and fenbufen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced convulsions in mice, but convulsion did not occur when a single administration of each drug was given. Inhibition by enoxacin of [3H]muscimol binding to mouse and human brain membranes was remarkably facilitated by fenbufen. These inhibitions were much more prominent in the hippocampus and frontal cortex than in the cerebellum of human and mouse brain. Enoxacin and fenbufen each at a high concentration produced a moderate and slight inhibition of the [3H]muscimol binding, respectively, in the hippocampus and frontal cortex but not in the cerebellum. It would thus appear that the drug interaction between enoxacin and fenbufen on the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor in hippocampus and frontal cortex plays a role in inducing convulsions.
The effects of allopurinol on the induction of bladder cancer by N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide (FANFT), excretion of urinary tryptophan metabolites, hepatic nitroreductase activity, and the acid-soluble thiol content of liver and blood in weanling female Fischer rats were investigated. Four groups of rats were given normal diet or normal diet supplemented with 0.005% allopurinol, 0.188% FANFT, or 0.005% allopurinol-0.188% FANFT. Transitional cell carcinomas appeared in 3 of 30 rats (10%) at 15 weeks and in 7 of 44 rats (16%) at 20 weeks in the FANFT-treated group; the carcinomas appeared in 14 of 35 rats (40%) at 15 weeks and in 27 of 50 rats (54%) at 20 weeks in the FANFT-allopurinol-treated group. Growth rate was not affected by allopurinol and FANFT. Allopurinol alone caused no morphological change in the epithelial cells of the urinary bladder but decreased hepatic cytosol nitroreductase activity. FANFT alone had no effect on hepatic cytosol or microsomal nitroreductase activity but increased hepatic and blood acid-soluble thiol content. FANFT increased the urinary excretion of anthranilic acid glucuronide, kynurenine, acetylkynurenine, and 3-hydroxykynurenine and decreased indican and o-aminohippurate excretion. Allopurinol did not alter the effects of FANFT on the acid-soluble thiol content of liver and blood or the excretion of urinary tryptophan metabolites.
Hydroxychloroquine therapy during pregnancy is thought to be safe for foetuses. Normal visual function has been showed on clinical grounds in infants exposed in utero to hydroxychloroquine, but there are few visual neurophysiological data. Our study was designed to assess retina and visual pathways using electroretinogram and visual evoked potentials in a series of infants born to mothers treated by hydroxychloroquine for connective tissue diseases.
Twenty-one infants (3-7 months of age) were consecutively examined between June 2002 and May 2007. Full-field electroretinogram was recorded by contact lens electrodes and visual evoked potentials were recorded by occipital surface electrodes using flash stimulation in mesopic condition. Analysis was focused on the amplitudes and latencies of the a- and b-waves of electroretinogram and the latency of the P(100) component of visual evoked potentials.
Electroretinogram abnormalities were detected in six infants, associated with delayed visual evoked potentials in four of them.
Early electroretinogram and visual evoked potentials testing evidenced neurophysiological visual disturbances in a subset of infants born to mothers treated by hydroxychloroquine. Systematic clinical and neurophysiological vision testing during childhood is needed to detect possible consequences of antenatal exposure to hydroxychloroquine.
A novel series of N-aryl-N'-pyrimidin-4-yl ureas has been optimized to afford potent and selective inhibitors of the fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases 1, 2, and 3 by rationally designing the substitution pattern of the aryl ring. On the basis of its in vitro profile, compound 1h (NVP-BGJ398) was selected for in vivo evaluation and showed significant antitumor activity in RT112 bladder cancer xenografts models overexpressing wild-type FGFR3. These results support the potential therapeutic use of 1h as a new anticancer agent.
Fischer 344 (F344) F(0) weanling rats, 30/sex/group, were exposed to acrylamide in drinking water at 0.0, 0.5, 2.0, or 5.0 mg/kg/day for 10 weeks and then mated. Exposure of F(0) females continued through gestation and lactation of F(1) litters. F(0) males, after F(0) mating, were removed from exposure and mated (one male: two untreated females) for the dominant lethal (DL) assay. Thirty F(l) weanlings/sex/group were exposed for 11 weeks to the same dose levels as their parents, and then mated to produce F(2) offspring. F(0) and F(l) parents and F(1) and F(2) weanlings were necropsied. Prebreeding exposure of F(0) and F(l) animals resulted in systemic toxicity at 2.0 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, with head tilt and/or foot splay increased at 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg/day. F(0) and F(l) reproductive indices and gestational length were unaffected. Implantations and live pups/litter at birth were reduced at 5.0 mg/kg/day. Survival of F(l) and F(2) pups was reduced at 5.0 mg/kg/day for PND 0 through 4 only. In the DL assay, total and live implants were reduced, pre- and postimplantation loss was increased, and the frequency of DL factors (F(L)%) was increased at 5.0 mg/kg/day. At 5.0 mg/kg/day, adult F(l) male peripheral nerves exhibited axonal fragmentation and/or swelling; F(l) female spinal cord sections were unremarkable. The NOEL for prenatal DL was 2.0 mg/kg/day; the NOEL for adult systemic toxicity, including neurotoxicity, was < or = 0.5 mg/kg/day. Therefore, neurotoxicity and DL were differentially affected.
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis is a severe complication of systemic heparin therapy. Its treatment is mainly based upon discontinuation of heparin therapy. However in some patients requiring emergency cardiac or vascular surgery, reexposure to heparin may be unavoidable. We report the management of two such patients by use of antiplatelet drugs for a vascular procedure. In the two cases, a combination of iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue (1 to 2 ng/kg/mn) with aspirin and dipyridamole was shown to inhibit ex vivo the heparin-induced platelet aggregation. These antiplatelet agents were continued during the perioperative period. A successful vascular procedure was achieved with full heparinization without subsequent thrombocytopenia or thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. This experience supports the hypothesis that heparin can be readministered early to patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, provided antiplatelet therapy is given.
Patchouli alcohol (PA) is a chemical compound extracted from patchouli which belongs to the genus Pogostemon, herb of mint family. Recently, it has been reported that PA inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the biological mechanisms of PA for anti-inflammatory activities have not been studied. In this study, we investigated whether PA decreases the production of inflammatory mediators through downregulation of the NF-κB and ERK pathway. Our data indicated that PA inhibits the over-expression of iNOS and IL-6 in protein and mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and TNF-α stimulated HT-29 cells. PA inhibited IκB-α degradation and p65 nuclear translocation, and subsequently suppressed transcriptional activity of NF-κB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and TNF-α-stimulated HT-29 cells. In addition, PA inhibited LPS- or TNF-α-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by decreasing phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These findings suggest that PA shows anti-inflammatory activities through suppressing ERK-mediated NF-κB pathway in mouse macrophage and human colorectal cancer cells.
Twenty-nine patients were treated for carcinoma of the head and neck with a combination of cisplatin, vincristine, and bleomycin. Four of these patients had acute vascular episodes (three had cerebrovascular accidents and one developed Raynaud's phenomenon) during or after treatment. Two additional patients with a similar history and course are also included for analysis. Three of these six patients had known underlying cardiovascular disease, which may have been a contributing risk factor. A reinstitution of bleomycin infusion produced a recurrence of the Raynaud's phenomenon in the patient who had developed that toxic effect.
Prazosin, an orally active alpha-1 selective adrenergic antagonist, has been of value in treating patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. In contrast to non-subtype-selective alpha-adrenergic antagonists and direct-acting vasodilators, prazosin's hypotensive action is accompanied by little or no increase in heart, rate, plasma renin, or plasma norepinephrine. Prazosin is a versatile drug that may be used alone or in combination to treat mild, moderate, or severe hypertension. The antihypertensive effect is sustained, and may increase during long-term therapy. The major side effect, postural hypotension after the first drug administration, is related to drug dose and intravascular volume depletion. Other side effects are mild and seldom limit therapy. In patients with congestive heart failure, prazosin results in balanced venous and arterial dilation, similar to that produced by nitroprusside. Attenuation of some or all of prazosin's initial hemodynamic effects has been seen during multiple short-term administrations. However, chronic studies have shown sustained symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement during long-term administration; initial hemodynamic attenuation may be transient or partial, and does not preclude long-term effectiveness, particularly during exercise. Preliminary studies indicate that prazosin may also be effective in treating patients with peripheral vasospasm due to Raynaud's phenomenon or ergotamine overdose.
This multicenter randomized phase III study was designed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of IFN alpha-2c (3.5 MU/d) in combination with either araC (10 mg/m(2) d1-10) or hydroxyurea (HU: 25 mg/kg per day) in newly diagnosed CML patients. A total of 114 patients were randomized. Following a median observation period of 36 (range 1-73) months the major cytogenetic response rates were 25 and 27% and the 4-year survival probabilities 62.5 and 63% for the araC and HU group, respectively. While the overall toxicity profile was comparable between both groups, patients in the HU arm exhibited a slightly higher degree of WHO grades 3 and 4 non-hematological toxicities.
Inhibitors of serotonin uptake are drugs prescribed without recognised cardiovascular risk. The authors report a case of torsades de pointes following Citalopram ingestion. In this patient, the proof of reintroduction in a hospital environment resulted in prolongation of the QT interval. Screening of patients for acquired or congenital long QT intervals is therefore necessary before starting treatment with Citalopram.
Stimulation of GABA receptors (e.g. by progabide, a new GABA receptor antagonist, or by muscimol) enhances the liberation of norepinephrine in limbic forebrain areas of the rat and reduces 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover. On repeated administration, this latter effect is associated with an up-regulation of 5-HT2 receptors as it occurs after electroconvulsive shock. The monoaminergic changes induced by progabide, though dissimilar from those induced by tricyclics, are probably connected with the antidepressant action on the compound observed in double-blind clinical trials. In the basal ganglia, GABA receptor agonists reduce dopamine turnover and potentiate the cataleptogenic action of neuroleptics. They also antagonize the sterotypic behaviour induced by dopaminomimetics, indicating an additional action beyond the dopamine synapse. On repeated co-administration with neuroleptics, progabide antagonizes the tolerance to the cataleptogenic action, the supersensitivity to dopaminomimetics, and the increase in 3H-spiperone binding which are caused by sustained neuroleptic treatment. This appears to be the basis for the clinical action of progabide in neuroleptic-induced dyskinesia, L-dopa-induced involuntary movements, and possibly mania. GABA receptor agonists decrease cellular excitability in several animal models and antagonize seizures, whatever their origin (GABA-mediated or GABA unrelated mechanisms). Progabide has been shown to be effective in various forms of epilepsy in double-blind and long-term clinical trials. The compound exerts a therapeutic action in patients resistant to "classical" antiepileptic drugs, in the virtual absence of major side effects.
Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) refractory to treatment with benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, and phenytoin presents a challenge to pediatric emergency and critical care specialists. Prompt seizure control may prevent mortality and morbidity.
A nine-month-old girl with hereditary fructose intolerance had prolonged, refractory CSE. Her seizures promptly stopped after administration of propofol (3 mg/kg bolus followed by infusion of 100 micrograms/kg/min). This dose resulted in electroencephalographic burst suppression. She required endotracheal intubation, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and pressor support.
This is the first pediatric case of prolonged, refractory CSE treated with propofol. The adult experience is reviewed. Propofol should be used only in a setting where definitive airway control and hemodynamic support is possible.
Effects of insulin and ascorbic acid on expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and caspase-3 activity in hippocampus of diabetic rats were evaluated in this study.
Diabetes was induced in Wistar male rats by streptozotocin (STZ). Six weeks after verification of diabetes, the animals were treated for 2 weeks with insulin or/and ascorbic acid in separate groups. Hippocampi of rats were removed and evaluation of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Bax proteins expression in frozen hippocampi tissues were done by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and blotting. The Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Bax proteins bands were visualized after incubation with specific antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescences method. Caspase-3 activity was determined using the caspase-3/CPP32 Fluorometric Assay Kit.
Diabetic rats showed increase in Bax protein expression and decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) proteins expression. The Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-x(L) ratios were found higher compared with non-diabetic control group. Treatments with insulin and/or ascorbic acid were resulted in decrease in Bax protein expression and increase in Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) proteins expression. The Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-x(L)/Bax ratios were found higher in treated groups than untreated diabetic group. Caspase-3 activity level was found higher in diabetic group compared with non-diabetic group. Treatment with insulin and ascorbic acid did downregulated caspase-3 activity.
Our data provide supportive evidence to demonstrate the antiapoptotic effects of insulin and ascorbic acid on hippocampus of STZ-induced diabetic rats.
The protective effect of aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, against hypertensive cardiovascular and renal injury remains to be defined. This study was undertaken to examine the protective effects of the combination of aliskiren and valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, against cardiovascular and renal injury. Endothelial NO synthase-deficient mice, subjected to cuff injury of femoral artery, were divided into 5 groups and were treated with the following: (1) vehicle; (2) aliskiren (25 mg/kg per day); (3) valsartan (8 mg/kg per day); (4) combined aliskiren (12.5 mg/kg per day) and valsartan (4 mg/kg per day); and (5) hydralazine (10 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks. Aliskiren and valsartan alone markedly and similarly suppressed cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation and fibrosis, and coronary remodeling; prevented cuff injury-induced arterial intimal thickening; and reduced urinary albumin excretion, glomerular inflammation, and glomerulosclerosis in endothelial NO synthase-deficient mice. These beneficial effects of aliskiren and valsartan were associated with the significant attenuation of oxidative stress in these tissues. Hence, aliskiren and valsartan markedly exert the protective effects against cardiovascular and renal injury through the reduction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, compared with monotherapy with aliskiren or valsartan, the combination of a half dose of these drugs more greatly improved the above-mentioned cardiovascular and renal injuries of endothelial NO synthase-deficient mice, which were associated with greater attenuation of tissue oxidative stress by the combination therapy. Thus, the combination of aliskiren and valsartan exerts the synergistic organ-protective effects through synergistic attenuation of oxidative stress. The combination of aliskiren and valsartan seems to be a promising therapeutic strategy for hypertensive organ injury caused by endothelial NO synthase dysfunction.
The differential diagnosis of afebrile seizures in the first year of life is extensive.
A 7-month old infant presented two afebrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 23 hours; her psychomotor and growth development followed a normal course. Laboratory analysis, cerebral echography and electroencephalogram were normal. Urine toxicology was positive for cocaine on two occasions. A negative urine sample was obtained 48 hours later. The parents denied drug abuse but explained a recent exposure to smoke some hours before the episode. The patient had no seizures in the following six months, with normal psychomotor development.
Passive inhalation of cocaine is associated with seizures in infants. There is no perception of the risk of passive exposure to cocaine in our country, despite the increasing consumption of crack in young adults. Urine toxicology should be systematically included in the study of a first afebrile seizure in an infant.
Cardiomyopathy in AIDS is an increasingly important clinical problem. Mechanisms of AIDS cardiomyopathy were explored using AIDS transgenic mice that express replication-incompetent HIV-1 (NL4-3delta gag/pol). Transgenic and FVB/n mice (n = 3 to 6 per cohort) received water ad libitum with and without zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine; AZT; 0.7 mg/ml) for 21 or 35 days. After 21 days, echocardiographic studies were performed and abundance of mRNA for cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2), sodium calcium exchanger (NCX1), and atrial natriuretic factor were determined individually using Northern analysis of extracts of left ventricles. After 35 days, contractile function and relaxation were analyzed in isolated work-performing hearts. Histopathological and ultrastructural (transmission electron microscopy) changes were identified. After 21 days, molecular indicators of cardiac dysfunction were found. Depressed SERCA2 and increased atrial natriuretic factor mRNA abundance occurred in left ventricles from AZT-treated transgenic mice. NCX1 abundance was unchanged. Eccentric left ventricle hypertrophy was determined echocardiographically. After 35 days, cardiac dysfunction was worst in AZT-treated and AZT-untreated transgenic mice. Decreases in the first derivative of the maximal change in left ventricle systolic pressure with respect to time (+dP/dt) occurred in transgenic mice with and without AZT. Increased half-time of relaxation and ventricular relaxation (-dP/dt) occurred in AZT-treated and -untreated transgenic mice. Increased time to peak pressure was found only in AZT-treated transgenic mice. In AZT-treated FVB/n mice, -dP/dt was decreased. Ultrastructurally, mitochondrial destruction was most pronounced in AZT-treated transgenic mice, but also was found in AZT-treated FVB/n mice. Transgenic mice that express HIV-1 demonstrate cardiac dysfunction. AZT treatment of FVB/n mice causes mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations that are similar to those in other species. In transgenic mice, AZT treatment worsens molecular and ultrastructural features of cardiomyopathy. HIV-1 constructs and AZT each contribute to cardiac dysfunction in this murine model of AIDS cardiomyopathy.
With the mouse pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), we showed a progressive loss of both principal cells and calbindin (CB)-, calretinin (CR)-, and parvalbumin (PV)-immunopositive interneurons in layers II-III of lateral entorhinal cortex (LEnt) from 2 months to 1 year after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE). In the efferent pathway of LEnt, more Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L)-labelled en passant and terminal boutons with larger diameters were shown in the hippocampus and subiculum; in the prefrontal, piriform, and perirhinal cortices; and in the amygdaloid complex in experimental mice at the two time points compared with the control after iontophoretical injection of an anterograde tracer PHA-L into the LEnt. Furthermore, the numbers of CB- or CR-immunopositive neurons contacted by PHA-L-labelled en passant and terminal boutons decreased in most of these areas at 2 months or 1 year after PISE. In the afferent pathway of LEnt, the numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons were reduced significantly in the ipsilateral piriform cortex and endopiriform nucleus at 2 months and 1 year and in the reuniens thalamic nucleus only at 1 year after injection of a retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) into the LEnt. The percentages of the number of CTB and CB or CR double-labelled neurons of all the retrogradely labelled neurons were also decreased in the reunions thalamic nucleus at 1 year after PISE. It is concluded that both cytoarchitectonic change and reorganization of afferent and efferent pathways in LEnt may be involved in the occurrence of TLE.
Local anesthetic containing epinephrine is commonly used in many operations for the main purpose of hemostasis. A randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial was designed to find out hemodynamic changes after local infiltration of different concentrations and/or different dosages of epinephrine during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) under general anesthesia.
One hundred and eight adult patients undergoing elective FESS under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into four groups. Group I received 2% lidocaine 2 ml with epinephrine (5 microg/ml); group II received 1% lidocaine 4 ml with epinephrine (2.5 microg/ml); group III received 1% lidocaine 4 ml with epinephrine (5 microg/ml); and group IV received 1% lidocaine 4 ml for local infiltration. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored continuously in the radial artery and recorded in 6 min: before infiltration (baseline), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, and 6 min after local infiltration. The lowest blood pressure (BP) in this period was also recorded.
Significant hemodynamic changes, particularly a decrease in BP (P < 0.001) with a slight increase in HR (P < 0.001) at approximately 1.5 min and an increase in SBP at approximately 3 min (P < 0.01) after local infiltration, were observed in group I, group II and group III compared with the baseline, but not in group IV. No significant hemodynamic differences were observed between group I, group II and group III at the same time points (P > 0.05).
Local infiltration of low-dose epinephrine causes temporary significant hemodynamic changes particularly a marked decrease in BP during FESS under general anesthesia.
The efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in adults with moderate-to-severe major depression are well established. However, most analyses combined dosages (20-80 mg/day) of the compound. We hypothesized that in patients taking 20 mg/day, efficacy would be maintained but the incidence of adverse events would be lower. We present a meta-analysis of efficacy and safety data for fluoxetine, 20 mg/day.
Data were from 3 double-blind studies (N = 417) that included patients with moderate-to-severe major depression (DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria) who received placebo or fixed-dose 20-mg/day treatment with fluoxetine. Efficacy was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D; HAM-D-17 total score and anxiety/somatization, retardation, sleep disturbance, and cognitive disturbance factors) and response and remission rates. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, reasons for discontinuation, and adverse events leading to discontinuation. Adverse events were evaluated to determine the emergence of activation and/or sedation.
At 20 mg/day, fluoxetine-treated patients demonstrated significantly greater remission and response rates and mean changes on HAM-D-17 total score and anxiety/somatization, retardation, and cognitive disturbance factor scores than placebo-treated patients (p < .001). The incidence of specific adverse events leading to discontinuation and the frequency of study discontinuations due to adverse events were similar among fluoxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients (6.1% vs. 5.8%, p = .879). Several adverse events (insomnia, asthenia, somnolence, gastroenteritis, decreased libido, chills, and confusion) occurred significantly more frequently among fluoxetine-treated patients. A significant change in sedation, but not activation, occurred in patients in the fluoxetine 20-mg/day group compared with the placebo group.
These data affirm that fluoxetine at 20 mg/day is efficacious, safe, and of similar activation potential when compared with placebo in patients with major depression.
Esmolol infusion at rates of 200, 300, and 400 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 was used to potentiate hypotension (mean arterial pressure = 60 mm Hg) induced with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in 10 male patients undergoing radical cancer surgery during nitrous oxide-oxygen and fentanyl anesthesia. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (radial arterial catheter), and plasma levels of renin activity (PRA), norepinephrine (N), epinephrine (E), and dopamine (D) were measured: 1) while patients were awake; 2) after induction of anesthesia (nitrous oxide, 60% in oxygen, fentanyl = 5 micrograms/kg followed by an infusion at 10 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1); 3) after surgery had begun; 4) after 20 minutes of SNP-induced hypotension; 5) after 20 minutes of esmolol at each of the above infusion rates; and 6) after the completion of surgery. Compared to awake values, SNP-induced hypotension (mean infusion rate = 3.1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 +/- 0.6 SE) during surgery resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) increases in heart rate, PRA, N, and D. Infusion of esmolol resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) dose-dependent reductions in SNP requirement to maintain MAP = 60 mm Hg. At 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, SNP requirement was 2.1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 +/- 0.4, at 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, it was 1.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 +/- 0.2, and at 400 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, was 0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 +/- 0.3. Concomitant with the decrease in SNP requirement, there were significant reductions in HR and PRA at all infusion rates of esmolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease has been linked to altered dopamine and glutamate transmission within the basal ganglia. In the present study, we compared compounds targeting specific subtypes of glutamate receptors or calcium channels for their ability to attenuate LID and the associated activation of striatal nuclear signaling and gene expression in the rat. Rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions were treated acutely or chronically with L-DOPA in combination with the following selective compounds: antagonists of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), (2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynylpyridine (MTEP) for mGluR5 and (3-ethyl-2-methyl-quinolin-6-yl)-(4-methoxy-cyclohexyl)-methanone methane sulfonate (EMQMCM) for mGluR1; an agonist of group II mGluR, 1R,4R,5S,6R-2-oxa-4-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylate (LY379268); N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-R2B subunit (NR2B)-selective NMDA receptor antagonists 1-[2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)ethyl]-4-[(4-methylphenyl)methyl]-4-piperidinol hydrochloride (Ro631908) and (+/-)-(R(*),S(*))-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)1-piperidine propanol (Ro256981); and an L-type calcium channel antagonist, 4-(4-benzofurazanyl)-1,-4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid methyl 1-methylethyl ester (isradipine). Dyskinesia and rotarod performance were monitored during chronic drug treatment. The striatal expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and mitogen- and stress-activated kinase (MSK)-1, or prodynorphin mRNA was examined after acute or chronic treatment, respectively. In the acute treatment studies, only MTEP and EMQMCM significantly attenuated L-DOPA-induced phospho-ERK1/2 and/or phospho-MSK-1 expression, with MTEP being the most effective (70-80% reduction). In the chronic experiment, only MTEP significantly attenuated dyskinesia without adverse motor effects, whereas EMQMCM and LY379268 inhibited the L-DOPA-induced improvement in rotarod performance. The NR2B antagonist had positive antiakinetic effects but did not reduce dyskinesia. Only MTEP blocked the up-regulation of prodynorphin mRNA induced by L-DOPA. Among the pharmacological treatments examined, MTEP was most effective in inhibiting LID and the associated molecular alterations. Antagonism of mGluR5 seems to be a promising strategy to reduce dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.
We report on an 82-year-old woman who suffered a sudden loss of consciousness, right-sided hemiparesis, and aphasia during a coronary angiographic procedure. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain performed immediately revealed an edema and extravascularly localized contrast media in the left hemisphere. Within 6 h, neurological symptoms had disappeared, and a second CT after 48 h revealed normal results. Usually, extravasation of contrast media affects the posterior circulation with cortical blindness. This case demonstrates that contrast media may affect the blood-brain barrier also outside the posterior circulation. If neurological symptoms occur during angiography, contrast media extravasation must be distinguished from embolism or vasospasm induced by the angiographic procedure.
Post-operative pain management is usually limited by adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. Adjuvant treatment with an inexpensive opioid-sparing drug such as ketamine may be of value in giving better analgesia with fewer adverse effects. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of ketamine administered peri-operatively in the treatment of acute post-operative pain in adults.
Studies were identified from MEDLINE (1966-2004), EMBASE (1980-2004), the Cochrane Library (2004) and by hand searching reference lists from review articles and trials. The manufacturer of ketamine (Pfizer AS, Lysaker, Norway) provided search results from their in-house database, PARDLARS. Randomized and controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients undergoing surgery, being treated with peri-operative ketamine, placebo or an active control were considered for inclusion.
Eighteen trials were excluded. Thirty-seven trials were included. Twenty-seven out of 37 trials found that peri-operative ketamine reduced rescue analgesic requirements or pain intensity, or both. Quantitative analysis showed that treatment with ketamine reduced 24-h patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine consumption and post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Adverse effects were mild or absent.
In the first 24 h after surgery, ketamine reduces morphine requirements. Ketamine also reduces PONV. Adverse effects are mild or absent. These data should be interpreted with caution as the retrieved studies were heterogenous and the result of the meta-analysis can not be translated into any specific administration regimen with ketamine.
Identification of new agents with antitumor activity in chemoresistant tumors is urgently needed for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug is successfully being used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Several clinical trials also suggest its ineffectiveness on solid tumors. We proposed that arsenic trioxide may be used as chemosensitizer, especially to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The effect of arsenic trioxide on cell proliferation of 5-FU-sensitive and -resistant HT29 colorectal cancer cells in vitro was tested by trypan blue dye exclusion assay, 2, 3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-S-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) cell proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Gene expression was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot methods. There was a dose-dependent increase in cell detachment and proliferation in HT29 and HT29FU cells. As a single agent, arsenic trioxide also down-regulated thymidylate synthase (TS) expression without affecting the expression of some other genes analyzed in the above cell lines. Combination of arsenic trioxide and 5-FU increased cytotoxicity. In vitro data show that as a single agent, arsenic trioxide down-regulated TS expression in HT29 cells. Addition of 5-FU to these sensitized cells increased cytotoxicity. These findings open up a possibility to use arsenic trioxide as a chemosensitizer in combination therapy.
Human data about resuscitation after cardiac arrest from ropivacaine are limited. We present a case of successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation after accidental ropivacaine-induced ventricular fibrillation. A 76-yr-old female patient presented for foot osteotomy. A femoral block was performed using a nerve stimulator, a short bevel needle and 20 mL of 1.5% mepivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine. The patient remained relaxed and conversant. Five minutes later, an anterior sciatic block was done with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine for prolonged analgesia. Despite a negative aspiration and incremental injection, the patient developed a tonic-clonic seizure, then gradual widening of the QRS complex, and subsequently ventricular fibrillation. The patient was resuscitated with chest compressions and airway support prior to pharmacologic treatment of defibrillation. Total venous ropivacaine concentration 5 min after the last injection was 3.2 mg/L, free ropivacaine was 0.5 mg/L, and total mepivacaine was 0.22 mg/L. The patient was admitted to the hospital and discharged the next morning without complications. This case demonstrates that techniques used to detect intravascular injection may reduce but not eliminate catastrophic events. Consequently, regional anesthesia using large amounts of local anesthetic should be done in locations with resuscitation equipment and by individuals trained to recognize these complications and begin early treatment.
