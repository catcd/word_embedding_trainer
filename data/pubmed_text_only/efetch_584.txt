A 25-year-old maintenance hemodialysis patient suffered an episode of mania. Oral lithium carbonate given as a single 600-mg dose following each dialytic treatment sustained serum lithium levels in the 0.6 to 0.8 mEq/l range. Clinical remission occurred quickly and was maintained throughout a 6-month follow-up period. No significant side effects were noted.
Resveratrol, an activator of histone deacetylase Sirt-1, has been proposed to have beneficial health effects due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol and the intracellular signaling pathways involved are poorly understood. An in vitro model of human tenocytes was used to examine the mechanism of resveratrol action on IL-1β-mediated inflammatory signaling. Resveratrol suppressed IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and PI3K in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with resveratrol enhanced the production of matrix components collagen types I and III, tenomodulin, and tenogenic transcription factor scleraxis, whereas it inhibited gene products involved in inflammation and apoptosis. IL-1β-induced NF-κB and PI3K activation was inhibited by resveratrol or the inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin), c-Src (PP1), and Akt (SH-5) through inhibition of IκB kinase, IκBα phosphorylation, and inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB, suggesting that PI3K signaling pathway may be one of the signaling pathways inhibited by resveratrol to abrogate NF-κB activation. Inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin attenuated IL-1β-induced Akt and p65 acetylation, suggesting that p65 is a downstream component of PI3K/Akt in these responses. The modulatory effects of resveratrol on IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and PI3K were found to be mediated at least in part by the association between Sirt-1 and scleraxis and deacetylation of NF-κB and PI3K. Overall, these results demonstrate that activated Sirt-1 plays an essential role in the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol and this may be mediated at least in part through inhibition/deacetylation of PI3K and NF-κB.
A wide range of drugs has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram by blocking the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel, HERG (ether-à-go-go-related gene), sometimes leading to life-threatening arrhythmia. In this paper we describe cloning, sequence, and expression of the zebrafish orthologue of HERG, Zerg. Further, we studied effects of Zerg inhibition in zebrafish embryos caused by drugs or by an antisense approach. Zerg is expressed specifically in both heart chambers of zebrafish embryos, is composed of six transmembrane domains, and shows an especially high degree of amino acid conservation in the S6 and pore domain (99% identity). Several QT-prolonging drugs added to the bathing medium elicited bradycardia and arrhythmia in zebrafish embryos. The arrhythmia induced ranged from an atrioventricular 2:1 block, the ventricle beating half as often as the atrium, to more severe irregular arrhythmia with higher concentrations of the drugs. These effects were highly specific, reproducible, and rapid, e.g., 10 microM astemizole caused a 2:1 heartbeat within a minute after addition of the compound in all the embryos studied. Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides targeting Zerg were injected into zebrafish embryos and elicited similar dose-sensitive and specific arrhythmia as the QT-prolonging drugs, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for Erg in regulating heartbeat rate and rhythm. Further, we identified a mutation in the Per-Arnt-Sim domain of the Zerg channel in the breakdance mutant, also characterized by a 2:1 atrioventricular block. In conclusion, the zebrafish could be a tractable model organism for the study of Erg function and modulation but might also have a value in the field of cardiovascular pharmacology, e.g., as an early preclinical model for testing drugs under development for potential QT prolongation.
Deoxyadenosines are closely related to adenosine and as such, may interfere with the cardiac adenylate cyclase pathway resulting in cardiac dysfunction. We report a rare case of a 42 year old man who developed transient cardiac failure following treatment with 2-CDA for hairy cell leukemia.
A case history is presented of a three-year-old boy with unsuspected Duchenne muscular dystrophy, who suffered a cardiac arrest following the administration of a single dose of succinylcholine during a halothane anaesthetic. The arrest was associated with lack of fasciculations, muscle rigidity, hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria, and massive elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase. Asystole was prolonged and refractory to treatment, although cardiac activity was eventually restored. The possible cause of the circulatory collapse is discussed and reports of similar cases reviewed. Neither succinylcholine nor halothane should be employed in cases with known or suspected Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
The genetic control of contact photosensitivity (CPS) to 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCSA) was studied in H-2- and IgH-congenic mice. The H-2 complex was found to play a major role in determining the pattern of responsiveness, whereas the effect of the Igh locus on the response was not apparent. The H-2k haplotype was closely associated with low responders, whereas mice with the H-2b,d alleles were high responders. The responsiveness of the H-2k strains was converted from low to high levels by treatment with cyclophosphamide (CY) before photosensitization. Transfer of spleen cells from photosensitized H-2k mice showed a suppressive effect on the development of the CPS reaction of syngeneic recipients pretreated with CY. These spleen cells contained antigen-specific CD4+, CD8- suppressor T cells (Ts) that functioned in the induction phase of CPS. The in vitro proliferation of immune lymph node T cells pulsed with photohapten-coupled cells plus peritoneal adherent cells was suppressed by the addition of anti-I-A monoclonal antibody in both H-2d and H-2k strains, suggesting that the I-A molecule are responsible for inducing the positive immune response. On the other hand, such proliferation was significantly enhanced by the addition of anti-I-E alpha antibody in H-2k, but not H-2d, mice. This implies that the low responsiveness of CPS in the H-2k strain is due to the preferential activation of Ts via I-Ek molecules. The present observation further supports the important role of the I-E molecule in the suppressor circuit of CPS to TCSA.
In the A alpha-chain gene coding for an abnormal fibrinogen (fibrinogen Marburg) we identified a single base substitution (A-->T) that changes the codon A alpha 461 AAA (Lys) to TAA (Stop). The propositus was found to be homozygous for the mutation, whereas the father and five siblings were heterozygous, and three other siblings contained only the normal sequence. The stop codon at position 461 results in the deletion of the carboxyl-terminal segment A alpha 461-610. Purified fibrinogen Marburg contained an A alpha-chain with a relative molecular weight of approximately 47,000. The FpA release by thrombin was not affected by this deletion, whereas the fibrin polymerization was strongly decreased. The binding of endothelial cells to immobilized fibrinogen Marburg was almost completely abolished compared with normal fibrinogen. Fibrinogen Marburg contained a substantial amount of albumin linked to the fibrinogen molecule by disulfide bonds, and these fibrinogen-albumin complexes were also present in plasma. The plasma fibrinogen concentration of the propositus was measured by three different methods: a functional method (< 0.25 mg/mL), an immunologic method using polyclonal antibodies (0.6 mg/mL), and an immunologic method based on two monoclonal antibodies specific for the amino-terminus and carboxyl-terminus of the A alpha-chain (< 0.05 mg/mL). Using the two immunologic methods, it appeared that only 10% to 15% of the plasma fibrinogen of the heterozygous siblings was abnormal.
Sulfur mustard (SM [bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide]) is a chemical warfare agent that causes skin blisters presumably due to DNA alkylation and cross-links. We recently showed that SM also induces apoptotic death in cultured normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE) cells and small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) in vitro. In this process, caspases-8 and -3, but not caspase-9, were strongly activated; this suggests a death receptor pathway for apoptosis. We now show that rat lungs were induced to undergo apoptosis in vivo following exposure of rats to SM by inhalation. Further study of the mechanism of apoptosis due to SM was performed with cultured NHBE cells and SAEC using tetrapeptide inhibitors of caspases-3, and -8. Inhibition of caspase-8 drastically reduced the activation of caspase-3 and almost eliminated that of caspase-9. Moreover, caspase-3 inhibition markedly reduced the activation of caspase-8 and also almost completely inhibited activation of caspase-9. These results suggest a death receptor pathway of apoptosis that utilizes a feedback amplification mechanism involving an activated death receptor complex that leads to the activation of caspase-9 via a caspase-3 pathway. These results may be important for the design of inhibitors of these pathways for therapeutic intervention to attenuate SM injury in respiratory tract lesions.
We report on a case of unilateral tinnitus after a short course of low-dose amitriptyline for neuralgic foot pain. This has been described in the literature previously at much higher doses and is associated with prolonged administration; we present our case with a review of the current literature in-order to raise awareness of this possible complication of anti-depressant therapy. We also propose a novel hypothesis for the pharmacological basis of amitriptyline-induced tinnitus.
Cognitive impairment or clinical signs of dementia in an old patient who receives digoxin, should suggest a digitalis intoxication. Symptoms can be present although a normal digoxin serum concentration. It is recommended to stop the treatment to obtain a regression of dementia symptoms.
Brain metastases are the most life-threatening among the secondary localizations of melanoma for their unresponsiveness to the surgical, radiotherapeutic and/or chemotherapeutic treatments.
Accidentally, we observed a complete response (CR) in a patient undergoing chemotherapy with bleomycin, vincristine or Oncovin, CCNU or lomustine, dacarbazine (BOLD) regimen for metastatic melanoma including brain metastases, who was also treated with G-CSF to manage a concomitant leukopenia. After this observation, seven more patients with stage IV melanoma with brain metastases were treated with BOLD regimen repeated every 6 weeks with administration of G-CSF in the intervals.
Three patients presented CR (37.5%). Two patients stopped the treatment after two courses for evident progressive disease (25%). The other three patients showed stable disease (SD: 37.5%). Median duration of SD was 24 weeks. Among the eight patients, six (75%) achieved clinical benefit. Median time to progression was 8.5 months (range 0-74+ months). Median survival was 12.5 months (range 4-74+ months). Two patients are still alive and disease-free after 74 and 57 months, respectively.
We believe that the brilliant CR, the long duration of the disease-free intervals and the long survival in at least three of eight patients should encourage further research on BOLD with G-CSF for the treatment of advanced melanoma.
Although oral creatine supplementation is very popular among athletes, no prospective placebo-controlled studies on the adverse effects of long-term supplementation have yet been conducted. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of creatine monohydrate in patients with the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, because of the neuroprotective effects it was shown to have in animal experiments. The purpose of this paper is to compare the adverse effects, and to describe the effects on indirect markers of renal function of long-term creatine supplementation. 175 subjects (age = 57.7 +/- 11.1 y) were randomly assigned to receive creatine monohydrate 10 g daily or placebo during an average period of 310 days. After one month, two months and from then on every fourth month, adverse effects were scored using dichotomous questionnaires, plasma urea concentrations were measured, and urinary creatine and albumin concentrations were determined. No significant differences in the occurrence at any time of adverse effects due to creatine supplementation were found (23 % nausea in the creatine group, vs. 24 % in the placebo group, 19 % gastro-intestinal discomfort in the creatine group, vs. 18 % in the placebo group, 35 % diarrhoea in the creatine group, vs. 24 % in the placebo group). After two months of treatment, oedematous limbs were seen more often in subjects using creatine, probably due to water retention. Severe diarrhoea (n = 2) and severe nausea (n = 1) caused 3 subjects in the creatine group to stop intake of creatine, after which these adverse effects subsided. Long-term supplementation of creatine did not lead to an increase of plasma urea levels (5.69 +/- 1.47 before treatment vs. 5.26 +/- 1.44 at the end of treatment) or to a higher prevalence of micro-albuminuria (5.4 % before treatment vs. 1.8 % at the end of treatment).
Self poisoning with maprotiline was studied in 41 patients (43 episodes) consecutively admitted to an intensive care unit. Thirty five patients had taken more than one drug or alcohol. Fifteen patients were in coma grade III or IV; 17 patients were still not conscious after 24 hours in the intensive care unit. Among six patients given ventilation the mean duration of ventilation in the five who recovered was 36 hours. Three patients had a cardiorespiratory arrest, and one patient died. Twenty eight patients had a QRS interval of 100 ms or more, and 15 patients had seizures. In six patients seizures were precipitated by physostigmine. Cardiotoxicity after overdosage of maprotiline is equal to if not greater than that found after overdosage of conventional tricyclic antidepressants. Overdosage of maprotiline is more often associated with seizures than overdosage with tricyclic antidepressants. Physostigmine further increases the risk of seizures and should not be used in cases of overdosage of maprotiline.
Clozapine is the drug of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Prompted by a patient who developed reversible clozapine-induced myocarditis after long-term treatment with clozapine for several years for chronic-resistant schizophrenia, we undertook a review of the relevant literature. Concerning the myocarditis, the patient recovered rapidly by withdrawal of clozapine and with supportive management. Psychiatric stabilisation of the patient was at least possible with a combination of quetiapine (600 mg) and amisulpride (800 mg). Well-designed studies with the aim to specifically investigate treatment options after clozapine are limited and clinical possibilities are discussed in this paper. Olanzapine and combinations using non-clozapine atypical neuroleptics have partly shown improvement, whereas evidence for successful augmentation with mood stabilisers, anticonvulsants or electroconvulsive therapy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia is limited.
In the presence of the transition metal iron, superoxide anion and H2O2 generated on reperfusion of postichemic tissue combine to form hydroxyl radical, which readily attacks membrane-associated polyunsaturated fatty acids in a free radical process, resulting in lipid peroxidation. To evaluate whether iron chelation with deferoxamine interrupts this process in postischemic skeletal muscle, high-grade partial hindlimb ischemia was created in Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the infrarenal aorta for 90 min, after which period the clamp was removed and flow was reestablished for 60 min. Lipid peroxidation in skeletal muscle was assessed by determination of tissue thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS); membrane dysfunction was assessed by measurement of resting membrane potential (Em). Ischemia was accompanied by an increase in muscle TBARS and depolarization of resting Em. On reperfusion, muscle TBARS continued to increase, whereas resting Em remained depolarized. Pretreatment with deferoxamine prevented lipid peroxidation during ischemia but had no effect on resting Em. On reperfusion in the deferoxamine-treated animals, there was still no increase in muscle TBARS, and partial repolarization of resting Em was noted. It is concluded that 1) high-grade partial ischemia in skeletal muscle is accompanied by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation via a mechanism that persists and accelerates on reoxygenation, 2) lipid peroxidation impacts on functional membrane integrity during the reperfusion phase only, and 3) membrane injury accompanying ischemia and reperfusion may occur through fundamentally different mechanisms, of which only the latter is iron dependent.
Role of chemokines in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) due to sulfur mustard (SM) gas inhalation.
18 veterans with SM gas-induced PF, 15 patients with IPF and 18 normal as controls.
Chest roentgenograms, PFTs, the percentage DLCO, high-resolution CT scans of the chest, and analyses of BAL fluids for chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta) were performed in all cases.
There were significant differences in chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta) levels of BAL fluid between patients with PF and healthy controls (p<0.0006). MCP-1 and MIP-1 alpha levels in BAL fluid correlate only with the percentage and the absolute number lymphocytes of the BAL fluid in patients with PF due to SM gas inhalation (p=0.0006/p=0.03; p=0.04/p=0.02; respectively). The BAL fluid level of MIP-alpha in SM gas-induced PF was significantly correlated with the number of lymphocytes (r=-0.56, p=0.01), neutrophils (r=-0.50, p=0.03) and eosinophils (r=-0.49, p=0.03). A significant negative correlation was observed between the percentage of Dlco and MCP-1 and MIP-1 alpha levels in BAL fluid in patients with PF (r=-0.65, p=0.003; r=-0.48, p=0.04; respectively).
Neutrophils alveolitis, presence of eosinophils, and higher concentrations of interleukin MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta in BAL fluid are associated with the development of fibrosis in SM victims.
Fifteen student volunteers participated in a study to determine the duration of amnesia obtained with diazepam and with pentazocine. The group that received pentazocine experienced only slight sedation and no amnesia. There was extreme variance in the level of sedation and in the incidence and duration of amnesia in the group that received diazepam. When amnesia occurred, it lasted for an average of 24 minutes. All students in the group that received a combination of diazepam and pentazocine were well sedated; the average duration of amnesia was 25 minutes.
Mercury, one of the widespread pollutants in the world, induces oxidative stress and dysfunction in many cell types. Alveolar type II epithelial cells are known to be vulnerable to oxidative stress. Alveolar type II epithelial cells produce and secrete surfactants to maintain morphological organization, biophysical functions, biochemical composition, and immunity in lung tissues. However, the precise action and mechanism of mercury on alveolar type II epithelial cell damage remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the effect and possible mechanism of methylmercury chloride (MeHgCl) on the human lung invasive carcinoma cell line (Cl1-0) and mouse lung tissue. Cl1-0 cells were exposed to MeHgCl (2.5-10 microM) for 24-72 h. The results showed a decrease in cell viability and an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level and ROS production at 72 h after MeHgCl exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase-3 activity, sub-G1 contents and annexin-V binding were dramatically enhanced in Cl1-0 cells treated with MeHgCl. MeHgCl could also activate Bax, release cytochrome c, and cleave poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP), and decrease surfactant proteins mRNA levels. Moreover, in vivo study showed that mercury contents of blood and lung tissues were significantly increased after MeHgCl treatment in mice. The MDA levels in plasma and lung tissues were also dramatically raised after MeHgCl treatment. Lung tissue sections of MeHgCl-treated mice showed pathological fibrosis as compared with vehicle control. The mRNA levels of proteins in apoptotic signaling, including p53, mdm-2, Bax, Bad, and caspase-3 were increased in mice after exposure to MeHgCl. In addition, the mRNA levels of surfactant proteins (SPs), namely, SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D (alveolar epithelial cell functional markers) were significantly decreased. These results suggest that MeHgCl activates an oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial cell death in alveolar epithelial cells.
Chromium (Cr) is an essential trace element that has garnered interest for use as a weight loss aid, but its molecular mechanism in obesity is not clear. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the effects of chromium histidinate (CrHis) on glucose transporter-2 (GLUT-2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB p65) and the oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal adducts (HNE) expressions in liver of rats fed high fat diet (HFD).
Male Wistar rats (n = 40, 8 wk-old) were divided into four groups. Group I was fed a standard diet (12% of calories as fat); Group II was fed a standard diet and supplemented with 110 μg CrHis/kg BW/d; Group III was fed a HFD (40% of calories as fat); Group IV was fed HFD and supplemented with 110 μg CrHis/kg BW/d.
Rats fed HFD possessed greater serum insulin (40 vs.33 pmol/L) and glucose (158 vs. 143 mg/dL) concentration and less liver Cr (44 vs.82 μg/g) concentration than rats fed the control diet. However, rats supplemented with CrHis had greater liver Cr and serum insulin and lower glucose concentration in rats fed HFD (P < 0.05). The hepatic nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB p65) and HNE were increased in high fat group compared to control group, but reduced by the CrHis administration (P < 0.05). The levels of hepatic Nrf2 and HO-1 were increased by supplementation of CrHis (P < 0.05).
These findings demonstrate that supplementation of CrHis is protective against obesity, at least in part, through Nrf2-mediated induction of HO-1 in rats fed high fat diet.
A 51-year old woman who had type-C chronic hepatitis developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia after 4 weeks treatment with a total 48 million interferon-beta, 6 million 8 times. Indirect Coomb's test turned from negative to positive through IFN therapy and a complication of asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis was confirmed by histologic findings of the biopsied liver which was performed during IFN therapy and a presence of anti-mitochondrial antibody. After stopping IFN therapy and adding prednisolone anemia improved in getting negative indirect Coombs test but remaining positive direct Coombs test.
We report a case study of an 86-year-old female patient with severe cholestatic hepatitis who was undergoing treatment with oral ticlopidine 250 mg daily for coronary artery disease. The patient had nausea and vomiting and was jaundiced after taking ticlopidine for 6 weeks. She was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography eliminated the presence of biliary obstruction. Results from a liver biopsy showed a histopathologic picture consistent with cholestatic hepatitis. Ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis has been reported 32 times in the foreign literature. This is the first reported severe cholestatic hepatitis (total bilirubin up to 43 mg/dl) case in Taiwan. Ticlopidine-related blood dyscrasia is a renowned adverse drug effect; liver function should be monitored in patients receiving ticlopidine therapy.
Exposure to mercury at nanomolar level affects cardiac function but its effects on vascular reactivity have yet to be investigated. Pressor responses to phenylephrine (PHE) were investigated in perfused rat tail arteries before and after treatment with 6 nM HgCl2 during 1 h, in the presence (E+) and absence (E-) of endothelium, after L-NAME (10(-4) M), indomethacin (10(-5 )M), enalaprilate (1 microM), tempol (1 microM) and deferoxamine (300 microM) treatments. HgCl2 increased sensitivity (pD2) without modifying the maximum response (Emax) to PHE, but the pD2 increase was abolished after endothelial damage. L-NAME treatment increased pD2 and Emax. However, in the presence of HgCl2, this increase was smaller, and it did not modify Emax. After indomethacin treatment, the increase of pD2 induced by HgCl2 was maintained. Enalaprilate, tempol and deferoxamine reversed the increase of pD2 evoked by HgCl2. HgCl2 increased the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity explaining the result obtained with enalaprilate. Results suggest that at nanomolar concentrations HgCl2 increase the vascular reactivity to PHE. This response is endothelium mediated and involves the reduction of NO bioavailability and the action of reactive oxygen species. The local ACE participates in mercury actions and depends on the angiotensin II generation.
Induced hypotension during anaesthesia can result in deterioration in gas exchange with increases in intrapulmonary shunting and physiological deadspace. Cardiovascular stability has been previously demonstrated with isoflurane-induced hypotension but the effects on gas exchange have not been carefully studied. We have examined the shunt fraction (QS/QT) and physiological dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) before, during and following deliberate hypotension in twelve patients. Group I (n = 6) received an isoflurane-oxygen-air mixture with an FIO2 of 0.5 while Group II (n = 6) received an isoflurane-oxygen mixture with an FIO2 of 1.0. Mean blood pressure was reduced from 76 +/- 2 mmHg to 47 +/- 2 mmHg in the combined group. Neither QS/QT nor VD/VT changed significantly during the hypotensive state in either group. We conclude that isoflurane induced hypotension is associated with minimal pulmonary derangement.
