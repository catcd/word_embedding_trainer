Environmental changes affecting the relationship between the developing immune system and microbial exposure have been implicated in the epidemic rise of allergic disease in developed countries. While early developmental differences in T cell function are well-recognised, there is now emerging evidence that this is related to developmental differences in innate immune function. In this study we sought to examine if differences associated with innate immunity contribute to the altered immune programming recognised in allergic children. Here, we describe for the first time, the association of carriage of the T allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism rs12979860 3 kb upstream of IL28B, encoding the potent innate immune modulator type III interferon lambda (IFN-λ3), and allergy in children (p = 0.004; OR 4.56). Strikingly, the association between rs12979860 genotype and allergic disease is enhanced in girls. Furthermore, carriage of the T allele at rs12979860 correlates with differences in the pro-inflammatory profile during the first five years of life suggesting this contributes to the key differences in subsequent innate immune development in children who develop allergic disease. In the context of rising rates of disease, these immunologic differences already present at birth imply very early interaction between genetic predisposition and prenatal environmental influences.
Three cases of hypersensitivity to an anaesthetic induction with fazadinium and thiopentone are described. One reaction was fatal. Two patients had documented and the third presumptive previous exposure to thiopentone, and all had a history of allergy (skin rash) to penicillin. None of the patients had received fazadinium before. The possibility that fazadinium contributed to the severity of the reactions is conjectural.
The endogenous opioid system plays an important role in the behavioral effects of nicotine. Thus, micro-opioid receptor and the endogenous opioids derived from proenkephalin are involved in the central effects of nicotine. However, the role played by the different endogenous opioid peptides in the acute and chronic effects of nicotine remains to be fully established. Mice lacking beta-endorphin were acutely injected with nicotine at different doses to evaluate locomotor, anxiogenic and antinociceptive responses. The rewarding properties of nicotine were evaluated by using the conditioned place-preference paradigm. Mice chronically treated with nicotine were acutely injected with mecamylamine to study the behavioral expression of nicotine withdrawal. Mice lacking beta-endorphin exhibited a spontaneous hypoalgesia and hyperlocomotion and a reduction on the anxiogenic and rewarding effects induced by nicotine. Nicotine induced similar antinociception and hypolocomotion in both genotypes and no differences were found in the development of physical dependence. The dissociation between nicotine rewarding properties and physical dependence suggests a differential implication of beta-endorphin in these addictive related responses.
After an outbreak of three cases of serogroup B meningococcal disease at a Norwegian college, 84 of 392 (21%) subjects were tonsillopharyngeal carriers of Neisseria meningitidis. To eradicate meningococcal carriage, 80 volunteers received a single dose of 400 mg of ofloxacin. Three days after treatment, all 75 evaluable volunteers were culture negative for N. meningitidis, and after 7 days none carried the strain that they carried initially, as judged by DNA fingerprinting. A single dose of ofloxacin was found to be 97.2% effective in eradicating carriage of N. meningitidis for a period of 33 days. The carriage acquisition rate among treated students was four times higher than that among nontreated noncarriers (P = 0.02). After ofloxacin treatment, no case of meningococcal disease occurred for 6 months. Ofloxacin may thus prevent the outbreak and spread of meningococcal disease.
Propiconazole, a widely used fungicide, is hepatotoxic and hepatotumorigenic in mice. Previous genomic analysis of liver tissues from propiconazole-treated mice identified genes and pathways involved in oxidative stress, suggesting that oxidative stress may play a role in propiconazole-induced toxicity. To understand the contribution of oxidative stress on toxicity at the protein level, we developed an integrated approach for the systematic measurement of protein oxidation in the livers from propiconazole-treated mice. Liver protein carbonylation increased significantly after treatment with propiconazole, demonstrating propiconazole-associated induction of oxidative stress. Utilizing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry, we identified 17 carbonylated proteins that were altered with varying intensities by propiconazole treatment. The potential effects of protein carbonylation on protein functions and cellular activities in the liver of propiconazole-treated mice were further investigated. A significant negative correlation between protein carbonylation and cytochrome c reductase activity was found. We conclude that glycolysis, mitochondrial respiratory chain, ATP production, amino acid metabolism, CO2 hydration, cellular antioxidant defense and detoxification system, and tetrahydrobiopterin pathways are affected by oxygen radicals in the livers of propiconazole-treated mice. This study suggests a mode of propiconazole-induced toxicity in mouse liver which primarily involves oxidative damage to cellular proteins.
Since the discovery of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in 1996, several novel gene defects have been detected, explaining the mechanism and diversity of iron-overload diseases. At least 4 main types of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) have been identified. Surprisingly, genes involved in HH encode for proteins that all affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis and its interaction with ferroportin, an iron exporter in enterocytes and macrophages. Hepcidin concentrations in urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH. Cytokine-mediated increases in hepcidin appear to be an important causative factor in anemia of inflammation, which is characterized by sequestration of iron in the macrophage system. For clinicians, the challenge is now to diagnose HH before irreversible damage develops and, at the same time, to distinguish progressive iron overload from increasingly common diseases with only moderately increased body iron stores, such as the metabolic syndrome. Understanding the molecular regulation of iron homeostasis may be helpful in designing innovative and reliable DNA and protein tests for diagnosis. Subsequently, evidence-based diagnostic strategies must be developed, using both conventional and innovative laboratory tests, to differentiate between the various causes of distortions of iron metabolism. This review describes new insights in mechanisms of iron overload, which are needed to understand new developments in diagnostic medicine.
We determined the mechanisms of hepatobiliary injury in the lithocholic acid (LCA)-fed mouse, an increasingly used model of cholestatic liver injury. Swiss albino mice received control diet or 1% (w/w) LCA diet (for 1, 2, and 4 days), followed by assessment of liver morphology and ultrastructure, tight junctions, markers of fibrosis and key proteins of hepatobiliary function, and bile flow and composition. As expected LCA feeding led to bile infarcts, which were followed by a destructive cholangitis with activation and proliferation of periductal myofibroblasts. At the ultrastructural level, small bile ducts were frequently obstructed by crystals. Biliary-excreted fluorescence-labeled ursodeoxycholic acid accumulated in bile infarcts, whereas most infarcts did not stain with India ink injected into the common bile duct; both findings are indicative of partial biliary obstruction. Expression of the main basolateral bile acid uptake proteins (sodium-taurocholate cotransporter and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1) was reduced, the canalicular transporters bile salt export pump and multidrug-related protein 2 were preserved, and the basolateral transporter multidrug-related protein 3 and the detoxifying enzyme sulfotransferase 2a1 were induced. Thus, we demonstrate that LCA feeding in mice leads to segmental bile duct obstruction, destructive cholangitis, periductal fibrosis, and an adaptive transporter and metabolic enzyme response.
In contrast with earlier reports that neutrophils play a primary part in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) injury to the stomach, recent evidence suggests only a secondary role for these cells.
To examine whether early microscopic changes induced by indomethacin in the gastric corpus of fasted rats and the antrum of fasted-refed rats involve neutrophil infiltration.
Oral indomethacin 30 mg/kg or vehicle was given to six groups of fasted rats that were killed five, 15, and 30 minutes after dosing. Subcutaneous indomethacin 30 mg/kg was also given to six groups of fasted-refed rats that were killed one, two, and four hours later. Haematoxylin and eosin and reticulin stained sections were examined to identify mucosal architectural changes. The gastric mucosa was also examined immunohistochemically for actin, fibrin, and neutrophils.
In both the corpus and antrum, indomethacin caused an early phase of mucosal injury that occurred prior to mucosal neutrophil infiltration. Within the superficial corpus mucosa, this phase preceded coagulative necrosis and included surface epithelial expulsion, mucosal contraction with capillary aggregation and distortion, intravascular vascular fibrin deposition, and capillary congestion. The antrum showed similar early changes except that full thickness mucosal coagulative necrosis was a predominant early finding.
In two experimental models of NSAID gastric ulceration the mucosa undergoes early contraction, vascular fibrin deposition, and necrosis prior to neutrophil infiltration. These findings support a primary, neutrophil independent, ischaemic pathogenesis for NSAID gastric ulceration.
Radiation can activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway and cannot downregulate survivin expression in breast cancer cells. Deguelin induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells by inhibiting pAkt and survivin expression. In this study, we assessed the effect of deguelin on radiosensitization of human breast cancer cells and its possible mechanism.
Deguelin and radiation were administrated in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The cytotoxic interactions and mutual influences between these 2 modalities were analyzed by a series of assays including clonogenic, flow cytometric, and Western blotting.
Phospho-Akt expression and survivin expression significantly decreased after 10 nM deguelin treatment, while phospho-Akt expression increased and survivin expression did not alter after radiation (3 Gy). However, phospho-Akt expression and survivin expression further significantly decreased after deguelin combined with radiation treatment. Deguelin combined with radiation markedly decreased clonogenic cell survival. After treatment of deguelin (10 nM) combined with radiation (3 Gy), caspase-dependent apoptosis was significantly increased and cell cycle was arrested in the G2-M phase in MDA-MB-231 cells.
Deguelin attenuates radiation-induced prosurvival Akt signaling and enhances the radiosensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells, and the mechanisms for this action may include inhibiting phospho-Akt and survivin expression, increasing caspase-dependent apoptosis, and prolonging cell cycle arrest in the G2-M phase.
Many drugs, including antibiotics, have been implicated in the aetiology of benign intracranial hypertension. We report the development of benign intracranial hypertension after the use of ciprofloxacin in a teenager with cystic fibrosis.
Patients with typical angina pectoris but without coronary artery disease (CAD) are distinct in clinical aspects. In only few patients no abnormality is detected. Most present at least one or more cardiovascular risk factors and/or signs of myocardial ischemia. As previous studies have shown, the coronary flow reserve is reduced in most of these cases. Regional measurements of the coronary flow reserve, performed by different approaches, have shown a profound variation in different myocardial areas. It is not yet clear, whether this heterogeneity is physiological or due to a pathologic process.
The aim of this study was the regional measurement of the myocardial perfusion reserve in patients without epicardial coronary stenoses using X-ray densitometry.
The myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) for all patients in the coronary artery territories was 1.6 +/- 0.5 (LAD), 2.0 +/- 0.7 (RCx), and 2.2 +/- 0.6 (RCA). In hypertensive patients the MPR was significantly lower in all territories compared to normotensive patients (1.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.7 [LAD], 1.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.7 [RCx], 2.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.9 [RCA]). The rise time (AT) is inversely proportional to the perfusion. At rest it was significantly shorter in hypertensive patients compared to normotensive patients (5.0 +/- 1.0 s vs. 6.5 +/- 2.0 s [LAD], 4.8 +/- 1.1 s vs. 6.1 +/- 2.6 s [RCx], 5.9 +/- 1.4 s vs. 7.8 +/- 4.0 s [RCA]), while there was no difference at maximum papaverine-induced hyperemia. A statistical correlation between MPR and wall thickness was found only for the LAD area. The heterogeneity of perfusion under basal flow conditions was more pronounced in normotensive than in hypertensive patients, while under maximal hyperemia there was no detectable difference. There was no statistically significant correlation between the semiquantiative wash-in counts of myocardial scintigraphy and MPR.
In this group of symptomatic patients MPR is lower than the lower limit of normal MPR, which is 3 in healthy individuals according to the literature. Patients with known arterial hypertension show a more severely impaired MPR which is especially pronounced in the LAD area and can be explained by a higher perfusion at rest. According to the authors' approach X-ray densitometry in the setting of coronary angiography is feasible and cost-effective to obtain information about the microvasculature.
An early-onset and rapidly progressive familial tauopathy with R406W mutation is described. The patient was a 47-year-old man who first presented with psychiatric symptoms followed by overt dementia at age 52 and died 1 year later. Postmortem study revealed tangle-associated neuronal degeneration, accentuated in the medial temporal lobe. R406W mutation was determined by sequence analysis and immunocytochemically with anti-mutant tau antibody.
An infant presented with a non-metastatic renal spindle cell sarcoma and hypercalcaemia, which resolved after treatment with indomethacin. There was in vivo and in vitro evidence that hypercalcaemia was mediated by circulatory prostaglandins.
To study the short-term effects of inhaled nitric oxide in infants and young children with congenital heart disease.
A supraregional referral centre for children with congenital heart disease.
22 infants and children aged 3-32 months (median age 5 months) with congenital heart disease undergoing preoperative cardiac catheterisation. All but one infant had intracardiac shunt lesions and 13 had increased pulmonary vascular resistance. During catheterisation the patients inhaled nitric oxide in a concentration of 40 parts per million in room air. Pulmonary and systemic haemodynamic variables were evaluated by means of measured oxygen consumption and the Fick principle before and after 10 minutes' exposure to nitric oxide.
Inhaled nitric oxide did not affect the systemic circulation. There was a significant reduction in the pulmonary vascular resistance, but only in the 13 infants with pulmonary hypertension, in whom pulmonary vascular resistance was reduced by 34% from 8.6 (4.6) mm Hg.min.m2.l-1 (mean (SD)) to 5.7 (3.5) mm Hg.min.m2.l-1. The pulmonary circulation in infants with normal pulmonary vascular resistance was not affected. No statistically significant increase in methaemoglobin was seen, though there were large individual differences. No other side effects were seen.
The present study shows that in infants with congenital heart disease inhaled nitric oxide reduced pathologically increased pulmonary vascular resistance without affecting systemic circulation and without important side effects with brief exposure.
A 61-year-old woman in chronic treatment with 25 mg of amitriptyline underwent ovarian cancer resection under combined general and epidural lumbar anesthesia. After administration of local anesthetic she presented signs of severe arterial hypotension that was refractory to high doses of ephedrine and administration of dopamine alpha-adrenergic substances. Control was achieved with 200 micrograms of noradrenaline. We review the anesthetic implications of chronic use of tricyclic antidepressives as they affect choice of vasopressin for treating hypotensive events during anesthesia.
A patient experienced phrenic nerve paralysis after doxycycline sclerotherapy for treatment of chylous fistula at our institution. The purpose of this study is to use physiologic testing to determine whether doxycycline is capable of inducing defects in neural function. A nonrandomized, controlled trial was performed with nerve-conduction studies to determine possible deleterious effects of doxycycline sclerotherapy. Thirty-eight CD rats were used and separated into four groups. Doxycycline was applied to the sciatic nerves of rats by either topical application directly on the nerve or by intraneural injection. Nerve-conduction studies were done before surgery and at 1,7, and 21 days after surgery. The results showed a statistically significant decrement in nerve-conduction velocity and strength of transmitted impulse in those nerves injected with doxycycline solution. Complete nerve block was seen frequently. This effect was not seen with topical application of doxycycline or normal saline solution or with intraneural injection of normal saline solution. This study demonstrates that doxycycline can induce a marked decrement in neural function when applied to the subepineural layers of the sciatic nerve in the rat. Therefore doxycycline sclerotherapy should be used with great caution in situations in which it could become exposed to nerves that have sustained surgical trauma.
We report an episode of transient, severe hypertension occurring within 2 minutes of injection of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 U of epinephrine in a patient taking midodrine for orthostatic hypotension. We hypothesize that the patient's autonomic nervous system was dangerously susceptible to the effect of local anesthetic when combined with the vasoactive systemic effect of midodrine. Surgeons should minimize the use of vasoconstrictors in patients treated with midodrine to avoid hypertensive complications.
Hepatotoxicity associated with intravenous sodium oxacillin therapy is reported in two drug abusers cured of staphylococcal endocarditis. Coincident with the administration of oxacillin, marked increases in hepatic transaminase were observed and liver biopsy showed nonspecific hepatitis. Upon cessation of oxacillin therapy, liver enzyme values returned to(ward) normal. Reports of oxacillin-associated changes in hepatic enzyme levels are reviewed; further observation of oxacillin-associated hepatotoxicity is warranted.
Adverse reactions to ophthalmic patients during 9909 fluorescein angiographies during 9 years were registered. Nausea (4.6%) and vomiting (1.3%) were the most common untoward reactions. Allergic skin manifestations occurred in 48 patients, and 5 patients complained of shortness of breath. 56 patients (0.6%) felt dizzy during or immediately after the investigation. Nine patients complained of chest pain, three of whom developed myocardial infarction. Sixteen patients collapsed during the procedure. One healthy male, 42-year-old, collapsed after the injection of fluorescein during angiography, and electrocardiogram showed an asystole of 24 seconds. Otherwise, the electrocardiograms registered on 100 consecutive patients did not reveal any systematic changes in heart rate or rhythm during fluorescein angiography.
Reports in the literature suggest that one reason for the greater sensitivity of mice to the carcinogenicity of 1,3-butadiene (BD) is that exposed mice metabolize much more of the BD to 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (BDO2) than do exposed rats. The purpose of this study was to determine the tumorigenicity of BDO2 in rats and in mice exposed to the same concentration of the agent. Female B6C3F1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 to 11 weeks old, 56 per group, were exposed by inhalation to 0, 2.5, or 5.0 ppm BDO2, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. Preliminary dosimetry studies in rodents exposed for 6 hours to 12 ppm BDO2 indicated that blood levels would be expected to be approximately 100 and 200 pmol/g at the two exposure concentrations in the rat and twice those levels in the mouse. During the 6-week exposure, the mice at the high exposure level showed signs of labored breathing during the last week, and four mice died. In the others, however, the respiratory symptoms disappeared after exposure ended. Rats showed no clinical signs of toxicity during exposure but developed labored breathing after the end of the exposure leading to the death of 13 rats within 3 months. At the end of the exposure, some animals (8 per group) were evaluated for the acute toxicity resulting from the BDO2 exposure. The remaining exposed rats and mice were held for 18 months for observation of tumor development. At the end of the exposure, rats had no biologically significant alteration in standard hematological parameters, but mice had a dose-dependent increase in neutrophils and decrease in lymphocytes. In both species the significant histopathologic lesions were in the nose, concentrated around the main airflow pathway. Necrosis, inflammation, and squamous metaplasia of the nasal mucosa, as well as atrophy of the turbinates, were all present at the end of exposure to 5.0 ppm. Within 6 months, necrosis and inflammation subsided, but squamous metaplasia remained in the mice. In rats that died after exposure, squamous metaplasia was seen in areas of earlier inflammation and, in other rats, extended beyond those areas with time. The metaplasia was severe enough to restrict and occlude the nasopharyngeal duct. Later, keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas developed from the metaplastic foci in rats but not mice. At the end of 18 months, the only significant increase in neoplasia in the exposed rats was a dose-dependent increase in neoplasms of the nasal mucosa (0/47, 12/48, and 21/48 for the control, 2.5 ppm, and 5.0 ppm exposures, respectively). Neoplasia of the nasal mucosa did not increase significantly in the mice; neoplastic lesions in the mice were observed in reproductive organs, lymph nodes, bone, liver, Harderian gland, pancreas, and lung. The only significant increase in neoplasms in a single organ in the mice was in the Harderian gland (0/40, 2/42, and 5/36 for the control, 2.5 ppm, and 5.0 ppm exposures, respectively). This tumor accounts for the apparent trend toward an increase in total neoplastic lesions in mice as a function of dose (10/40, 7/42, and 16/36 for control, 2.5 ppm, and 5.0 ppm exposures, respectively). These findings indicate that the metabolite of BD, BDO2, is carcinogenic in the respiratory tract of rats. An increase in respiratory tract tumors was not observed in similarly exposed mice despite the fact that preliminary studies indicated mice should have received twice the dose to tissue compared with the rats. High cytosolic activity of detoxication enzymes in the mouse may account, in part, for the differences in response.
Areca nut chewing is the fourth most popular habit in the world due to its effects as a mild stimulant, causing a feeling of euphoria and slightly heightened alertness. Areca nuts contain several alkaloids and tannins, of which arecoline is the most abundant and known to have several adverse effects in humans, specially an increased risk of oral cancer. On evaluating the effects of arecoline on the male endocrine physiology in Wistar rats, it was found that arecoline treatment led to an overall enlargement and increase in the wet weight of the prostate gland, and a two-fold increase in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels. Since the prostate is a major target for testosterone, the consequences of arecoline consumption were studied specifically in the prostate gland. Arecoline treatment led to an increase in the number of rough endoplasmic reticulum and reduction of secretory vesicles, signifying a hyperactive state of the prostate. Increased expression of androgen receptors in response to arecoline allowed for enhanced effect of testosterone in the prostate of treated animals, which augmented cell proliferation, subsequently confirmed by an increase in the expression of Ki-67 protein. Cellular proliferation was also the outcome of concomitant over expression of the G(1)-to-S cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin D1 and CDK4, both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Taken together, the findings provide the first evidence that regular use of arecoline may lead to prostatic hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and eventually to disorders associated with prostate enlargement.
We have examined the effects of 7 days treatment with beta adrenoceptor antagonists in 8 healthy volunteers in a placebo controlled, crossover study. We investigated three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol, oxprenolol, and propranolol), which have differing profiles of selectivity and partial agonist properties (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, ISA). We studied adrenaline-induced hypokalaemia, the vasodilator response to an infusion of adrenaline (0.06 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 for 90 min), and lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor number, determined by (-) [125I]-iodocyanopindolol binding, and measured these variables both before and after 7 days of treatment. The beta 2-mediated depressor response to adrenaline infusion was abolished by propranolol and oxprenolol but persisted after atenolol. In contrast, the hypokalaemia induced by adrenaline was abolished by all three beta-blockers. Lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor number increased significantly following propranolol treatment, but not after oxprenolol for atenolol. We conclude that up-regulation of lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors is dependent on beta 2-receptor blockade and is modified by ISA. The reversal of the hypokalaemic response by atenolol suggests that beta 1 receptors may contribute to the former effect. Alternatively, since different populations of beta 2-adrenoceptors differ in their susceptibility to antagonists there may also be differences in agonist coupling to beta 2-responses between tissues.
A prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) refractory to medical treatment was designed. Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease (mean disease time, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn & Yahr stage 3-5 in off-drug phases) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias were selected. All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analysed. Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and four in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn&Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living (ADL) score in 'on'- and 'off'-drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery. There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months. Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group. Changes in UPDRS, Hoehn & Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups. Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups. Complications were observed in two patients: one had a left homonymous hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg/day. The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment.
The inhibitory effects exerted by dexamethasone on the epileptiform activity induced by morphine were investigated in two different experimental models with two different animal species. In the first series of experiments, dexamethasone administered i.v. in rabbits 30 min before i.c.v. administration of morphine completely prevented both epileptiform and background EEG as well as behavioral alterations induced by morphine. Cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) pretreatment reversed the antagonistic effect induced by dexamethasone on the behavioral and EEG alterations induced by morphine. In the second series of experiments, the effects exerted by dexamethasone were investigated on morphine-induced CA1 epileptiform bursting on rat hippocampal slices in vitro. Dexamethasone pretreatment 10 to 60 min before morphine strongly prevented the morphine effects in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Sixty min of dexamethasone pretreatment also prevented the epileptiform bursting induced by the selective mu opiate receptor agonist DAMGO, whereas it did not significantly affect the increase of the CA1 population spike amplitude due to the selective delta opiate receptor agonist DPDPE. The addition of cycloheximide to the slice-perfusing medium containing dexamethasone prevented the inhibitory effects of the drug toward the morphine and DAMGO-induced CA1 epileptiform bursting. Our results indicate that dexamethasone induces an inhibition on the epileptiform activity induced by morphine and DAMGO. The time lag (30-60 min) which is necessary for revealing the inhibitory influence of dexamethasone on opiate epileptiform activity induced both in vivo and in vitro, and the inhibitory effect exerted by cycloheximide on dexamethasone activity strongly support the hypothesis of a genomic corticosteroid effect within the central nervous system.
ICF syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by variable immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial abnormalities. Mutations in the catalytic domain of DNMT3B, a gene encoding a de novo DNA methyltransferase, have been recognized in a subset of patients. ICF syndrome is a genetic disease directly related to a genomic methylation defect that mainly affects classical satellites 2 and 3, both components of constitutive heterochromatin. The variable incidence of DNMT3B mutations and the differential methylation defect of alpha satellites allow the identification of two types of patients, both showing an undermethylation of classical satellite DNA. This classification illustrates the specificity of the methylation process and raises questions about the genetic heterogeneity of the ICF syndrome.
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug now more frequently used after a number of years in which the use had been on the decline due to a number of studies which reported side effects such as chronic toxicity, primarily in the lungs, liver and thyroid glands. Additionally, in some patients an increase in serum creatinine was noted, however the effect of amiodarone on renal function had never been closely examined. Thus, the aim of our study was to analyse the effects of amiodarone on renal function in rats. Experiments were carried out in male Wistar rats divided in two experimental groups: 1) a control group, (n=8), 2) a group that received a daily intraperitoneal injection of amiodarone (50 mg/kg body weight) for 6 days (n=5). At the end of the treatment, renal function was measured by clearance creatinine and acute clearance studies. Renal toxicity was evaluated by urinary N-acetyl-glucosamine and alkaline phosphatase. At the end of the experiment, histology studies were done. Rats treated with amiodarone had a higher serum creatinine (182%) and a lower glomerular filtration rate (53%), renal plasma flow (68%) and filtration fraction (62%) than controls. Rats treated with amiodarone also showed an increase in urinary N-acetyl-glucosamine (221%) and alkaline phosphatase (4.151%) excretion which corresponds with tubular alterations showed on electron microscopy. In conclusion our data confirm that amiodarone induces acute renal damage in the rat.
