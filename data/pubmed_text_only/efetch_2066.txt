Iatrogenic renal stones although rare, must be diagnosed. It is therefore essential to use modern techniques such as infrared spectrophotometry. We report a new case of renal stones due to triamterene. Various predisposing factors are examined, in particular urine acidity and the presence of protein in the stones.
Neuroinflammation contributes to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Thalidomide (THL) shows potent anti-inflammatory properties and increased the lifespan in ALS transgenic mice. Thalidomide was therefore suggested as atherapeutic intervention for the treatment of ALS.We conducted a pilot, randomized clinical trial of THL in patients with ALS to assess safety, feasibility, and preliminary estimates of treatment efficacy.
Patients were randomized to THL in combination with riluzole (n = 18) or riluzole alone (n = 19). THL was initiated at 100 mg per day for 6 weeks. Thereafter, the dose was increased every week by 50 mg until reaching the dose of 400 mg per day and planned to continue for another 12 weeks.
Within 12 weeks of THL treatment, nine THL patients (50%) developed bradycardia defined as a heart rate below 60 beats per minute (bpm) and ranged from 46 to 59 bpm. Mean heart rate dropped by 17 bpm with THL treatment. Severe symptomatic bradycardia of 30 bpm occurred in one patient. A further patient died from sudden unexpected death. The study was terminated prematurely for safety concerns. The secondary outcome variables showed similar results for both groups.
Bradycardia was the most common adverse event of THL treatment in ALS. THL-related bradycardia does not appear to be ALS-specific. It is conceivable, however, that the unexpected frequency and severity of THL-induced bradycardia may be related to subclinical involvement of the autonomic nervous system in ALS. The cardiac toxicity discourages further clinical trials and compassionate use of THL in ALS. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00231140.
A 56-year-old man presented with an oronasal fistula in the palatum durum due to cocaine sniffing.
The cholinesterase inhibitors huperzine A, donepezil and rivastigmine were compared for their effects on extracellular acetylcholine concentration and acetylcholinesterase activity in the rat cortex. After i.p. injection, huperzine A (0.25-0.75 micromol/kg), donepezil (2-6 micromol/kg) and rivastigmine (0.75-1.5 micromol/kg) dose-dependently elevated the concentration of acetylcholine. The duration of huperzine A was longest. The time courses of cortical acetylcholinesterase inhibition with middle doses of these agents mirrored the increases of acetylcholine at the same doses. However, acetylcholinesterase inhibition was disproportionately greater after middle dose of rivastigmine than doses of huperzine A and donepezil that increased acetylcholine to a similar extent. Muscle fasciculation appeared only after donepezil with a dose-dependent incidence and intensity. In molar terms, huperzine A was 8- and 2-fold more potent than donepezil and rivastigmine, respectively, in increasing cortical acetylcholine levels, with a longer-lasting effect.
Five female patients who developed psychosis while taking diethylpropion hydrochloride are described, four with paranoid psychosis and one with manic psychosis. In all but one patient, these drugs were medically prescribed. Although relatively few cases of psychosis and psychosis-like illness were reported to the Committee for Safety of Medicines from 1963 until 1986, further cases may be anticipated. Patients on the drug should be carefully supervised and it should not be prescribed to those with personality disorder, previous evidence of amphetamine, alcohol, or other drug abuse, or those with a history of psychiatric breakdown.
Cisplatin (CP) is a major antineoplastic drug for the treatment of solid tumors, however, dose dependent nephrotoxicity remains the major concern for its long term use. Several agents/strategies were attempted to prevent CP nephrotoxicity but were not found suitable for clinical practice. Dietary fish oil (FO) enriched in ω-3 fatty acids has been shown to prevent/reduce the progression of certain types of cancers, cardiovascular and renal disorders. The present study was undertaken to see whether FO can prevent CP-induced nephrotoxic and other deleterious effects. Rats were prefed experimental diets for 10days and then received a single dose of CP (6mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally while still on diet. Serum/urine parameters, enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM) and oxidative stress in rat kidney were analyzed. CP nephrotoxicity was recorded by increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. CP decreased the activities of metabolic enzymes, antioxidant defense system and BBM enzymes. In contrast, FO alone increased enzyme activities of carbohydrate metabolism and brush border membrane (BBM). FO feeding to CP treated rats markedly enhanced resistance to CP-elicited deleterious effects. Dietary FO supplementation ameliorated CP induced specific metabolic alterations and oxidative damage due to its intrinsic biochemical antioxidant properties.
The clinical pharmacology of a central antihypertensive drug, guanfacine, was studied in sustained essential hypertension. The study of the haemodynamics, performed in 7 patients demonstrated a significant decrease in blood pressure and a fall in heart rate (less than the one observed with clonidine): the peripheral resistances remained unchanged after 4 days treatment. A clinical trial was carried out in 20 patients with sustained essential hypertension. Guanfacine was given orally (2 to 4 mg/day) during 2 months; the results of this study confirmed the antihypertensive effect of the drug. The most frequent side effects were dryness of the mouth and sleepiness. Guanfacine kinetics were studied in patients after single and repeated oral doses. The plasma concentrations were fitted in a two compartments open model with first order absorption. Steady state plasma level during a long term treatment can be determined with the predicted values derived from simulation of the initial individual kinetic studies. For a 2 mg dosage the biological half-life was 22.8 +/- 3.6 h. Guanfacine kinetics were linear according to the dosage. In moderate permanent essential hypertension guanfacine can be easily prescribed in monotherapy at a posology of 2 to 4 mg/day.
A variety of drug treatment regimens have been proposed to model the dysphoric state observed during methamphetamine (METH) withdrawal in rats, but little has been established in experiments using mice. In male ICR mice, a fixed-dose injection regimen of METH (1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily for 10 consecutive days) induced a significant decrease in the time spent in open arms in an elevated plus maze after 5 days of drug abstinence. Under an escalating-dose injection regimen (0.2-2.0 mg/kg, i.p., 3 times daily for 4 days, total: 15 mg/kg/animal) or continuous subcutaneous administration with osmotic mini-pumps (15 or 76 mg/kg of METH for 2 weeks), no significant behavioral change was observed after 5 days of drug abstinence, compared with control animals. Reduced gains in body weight were observed during repeated treatment with METH in the fixed-dose injection and mini-pump treatment regimens, but not the escalating-dose injection regimen. HPLC analysis revealed significant decreases in the level of cerebral 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, a norepinephrine metabolite, and norepinephrine turnover, which may be attributed to the expression of anxiety-related behavior in the elevated plus maze. These observations suggest that the mice treated with a fixed-dose of METH may model the anxiety-related behavior observed in the dysphoric state induced by METH withdrawal in humans.
Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the first immunosuppressant universally used in allotransplantation. However, it has been demonstrated that this drug produces side effects in several organs, particularly in the kidney and in the heart. Since the immunosuppressive therapy induces myocardial toxicity, the aim of this study was to evaluate in the myocardium of CsA-treated rats the expression variations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), to verify if: VEGF increased, VEGF increase was associated with MMP2 increase and they could be considered as repair proteins. The study was carried out on 28 Wistar rats divided into two groups. The group I animals served as control and so they were subcutaneously injected daily with castor oil for 21 days; group II: animals were subcutaneously injected daily with CsA (Sandimmun, Sandoz) at the therapeutic dose (15 mg/kg) for 21 days. The group I animals (control) showed normal heart architecture and low levels of MMP2 and VEGF. The group II animals (CsA-treated) showed structural degenerative changes with myocardial fibrosis and a clear increase both in MMP2 and VEGF. These data show that the immunosuppressant therapy induces a high increase in both the proteins and that VEGF variations are associated with MMP2 variations. These findings suggest that these proteins are involved in the endogenous emergency cell mechanisms induced by stress conditions, probably playing a role against myocardial injury as repair proteins.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway is critical for cellular growth and metabolism. Correspondingly, loss of function of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K, or activating mutations in AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3 have been found in distinct disorders featuring overgrowth or hypoglycemia. We performed exome sequencing of DNA from unaffected and affected cells from an individual with an unclassified syndrome of congenital progressive segmental overgrowth of fibrous and adipose tissue and bone and identified the cancer-associated mutation encoding p.His1047Leu in PIK3CA, the gene that encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K, only in affected cells. Sequencing of PIK3CA in ten additional individuals with overlapping syndromes identified either the p.His1047Leu alteration or a second cancer-associated alteration, p.His1047Arg, in nine cases. Affected dermal fibroblasts showed enhanced basal and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) generation and concomitant activation of downstream signaling relative to their unaffected counterparts. Our findings characterize a distinct overgrowth syndrome, biochemically demonstrate activation of PI3K signaling and thereby identify a rational therapeutic target.
De novo somatic mutations in focal areas are well documented in diseases such as neoplasia but are rarely reported in malformation of the developing brain. Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is characterized by overgrowth of either one of the two cerebral hemispheres. The molecular etiology of HME remains a mystery. The intractable epilepsy that is associated with HME can be relieved by the surgical treatment hemispherectomy, allowing sampling of diseased tissue. Exome sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis in paired brain-blood samples from individuals with HME (n = 20 cases) identified de novo somatic mutations in 30% of affected individuals in the PIK3CA, AKT3 and MTOR genes. A recurrent PIK3CA c.1633G>A mutation was found in four separate cases. Identified mutations were present in 8-40% of sequenced alleles in various brain regions and were associated with increased neuronal S6 protein phosphorylation in the brains of affected individuals, indicating aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Thus HME is probably a genetically mosaic disease caused by gain of function in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT3-mTOR signaling.
Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndromes are sporadic overgrowth disorders associated with markedly enlarged brain size and other recognizable features. We performed exome sequencing in 3 families with MCAP or MPPH, and our initial observations were confirmed in exomes from 7 individuals with MCAP and 174 control individuals, as well as in 40 additional subjects with megalencephaly, using a combination of Sanger sequencing, restriction enzyme assays and targeted deep sequencing. We identified de novo germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. These include 2 mutations in AKT3, 1 recurrent mutation in PIK3R2 in 11 unrelated families with MPPH and 15 mostly postzygotic mutations in PIK3CA in 23 individuals with MCAP and 1 with MPPH. Our data highlight the central role of PI3K-AKT signaling in vascular, limb and brain development and emphasize the power of massively parallel sequencing in a challenging context of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity combined with postzygotic mosaicism.
We injected technical quality DDVP ip into 13 dogs at a dose of 30 mg/kg, a dose 100% lethal in 27 minutes. We monitored blood pH, arterial gases, and cholinesterase activity before and during the intoxication and found acidosis. We used iv sodium bicarbonate and achieved recovery of acid-base balance, improvement in the poisoned state, and survival of 84.6% of the patients.
1. Recent studies indicate that neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by the deposition of beta-amyloid protein (A beta) in senile plaques. Nicotine as a major component of cigarette smoke has been suggested to have a protective effect for neurons against A beta neurotoxicity. 2. Our present study demonstrates that nicotine protected cultured hippocampal neurons against the A beta-induced apoptosis. Nicotine effectively inhibits apoptosis in hippocampal cultures caused by A beta(25-35) or A beta(1-40) treatment and increase of caspase activity induced by A beta(25-35) or A beta(1-40). 3. Measurements of cellular oxidation and intracellular free Ca(2+) showed that nicotine suppressed A beta-induced accumulation of free radical and increase of intracellular free Ca(2+). 4. Cholinergic antagonist mecamylamine inhibited nicotine-induced protection against A beta-induced caspase-3 activation and ROS accumulation. 5. The data show that the protection of nicotine is partly via nicotinic receptors. Our results suggest that nicotine may be beneficial in retarding the neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic neurodegeneration leading to the development of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we investigated whether naphtha[1,2-d]thiazol-2-amine (NTA) may ameliorate haloperidol-induced catalepsy and oxidative damage in mice brain. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was measured with the standard bar test. The extent of oxidative stress has been evaluated by measuring levels of MDA, GSH and activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GSH-Px) from brain homogenate. Haloperidol treatment significantly induced the catalepsy as observed from increased descent time measured in the bar test. Pretreatment with NTA significantly reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol in a dose-dependent manner. The elevated level of MDA in haloperidol-treated mice was significantly decreased by NTA pretreatment. The decreased level of GSH as well as SOD and GSH-Px activities in haloperidol-treated mice were significantly increased by NTA pretreatment. NTA reduces the oxidative stress allowing recovery of detoxifying enzyme activities and controlling free radical production, suggesting a potential role of the drug as an alternative/adjuvant drug in preventing and treating the neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.
A 75-year-old female rheumatoid arthritis patient who was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and for antibodies to hepatitis Be antigen showed liver dysfunction, and therefore methotrexate (MTX) therapy was discontinued. Her drug lymphocyte stimulation test indicated positivity for MTX. Her liver dysfunction improved briefly, but she developed fulminant hepatitis with elevated levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV)/DNA polymerase and subsequently died. HBV/DNA analysis performed with polymerase chain reaction-mutation site-specific assay revealed that the fulminant hepatitis was caused by a precore mutant virus. Sudden reactivation of the immune system by discontinuation of MTX may have led to the attack on infected cells. Even when hepatitis Be antibodies are present, MTX should not be used in patients who have chronic infection with HBV.
Increased extraglandular aromatization has been reported to cause the rare entity of familial gynecomastia. Recently heterozygous inversions at the p450 aromatase gene promotor locus were detected in two different families with this syndrome. We studied a family in which seven affected males over three generations had inherited prepubertal gynecomastia in an autosomal dominant manner. The proband developed gynecomastia at 11.5 yr, entered puberty at 12.5 yr, but was incompletely virilized at 19 yr. A similar development was observed in his affected stepbrother and one first-degree cousin. All three boys had acceleration of prepubertal growth and bone age. The older two had a diminished pubertal growth spurt and precocious growth arrest, but their final heights were within the range of their target height. In addition, the maternal grandfather and three maternal uncles were affected, who all had been mastectomized. The mother of the proband had normal age at menarche and no macromastia. Estrone levels of the proband and the other affected boys were elevated, 17beta-estradiol levels were high-normal, and testosterone levels were low. Hormonal analyses of the affected adults, who had all fathered children, revealed pathologically low serum testosterone levels but normal to high-normal levels of estradiol and estrone. The mother of the proband had elevated estrone levels. Treatment of the proband was more effective with anastrozole than with testolactone and increased the initially reduced testes volume to normal size, promoted virilization, and normalized serum estrone and testosterone levels. Neither preadipocytes from breast fat tissue of the affected stepbrother nor peripheral lymphocytes of the affected boys exhibited increased aromatase activity in culture. Therefore, these cells can be excluded from being the source of estrone excess. In addition, serum of the proband and his stepbrother did not contain factors promoting aromatase activity as assayed using preadipocytes from control individuals.A repeat polymorphism of the p450 aromatase gene cosegregated with the disease phenotype in the family, making a mutation of the p450 aromatase gene likely. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the known alternative untranslated exons and all coding exons of the p450 aromatase gene did not indicate any mutation. In addition, fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using four probes covering the promotor region did not reveal the presence of any major inversion at this locus. In conclusion, preadipocytes and blood cells were excluded as the cell source of increased aromatization. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and single-strand conformational polymorphism analyses did not reveal any mutation of the p450 aromatase gene, but an intragenic polymorphic marker cosegregated with the disease phenotype. Excess of serum estrone in the presence of normal 17beta-estradiol levels may be the only indicative serum parameter of this mild manifestation of aromatase excess syndrome, which includes prepubertal gynecomastia and moderate hypogonadism in men but not necessarily short stature. In women, this mode of aromatase excess may remain clinically inapparent.
Rotationplasty is a well-established procedure after total femur resection, especially in children. Rehabilitation is superior to disarticulation of the hip or hemipelvectomy because patients regain hip and knee function.(1) A tight fit of the prosthetic shaft is essential. The pretibial area has a low physiological resistance to pressure and shear forces, and is thus at increased risk of developing pressure-related complications. Skin defects with exposure of skeletal elements require flap coverage. The dorsalis pedis flap is one of the surgical options available for skin coverage of the proximal anterior leg. It can be rotated to cover almost any site on the anterior aspect of the leg if the pedicle is mobilised up to the anterior tibial artery.(2)Since donor site complications are common, this flap has few indications.(3)
Myoclonus is a possible side effect of opioid therapy, and have been described following systemic as well as spinal application.
We report the case of a patient with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum who developed myoclonus following administration of high-dose epidural combined with iv morphine. This complication occurred with maximum daily doses of 300 mg epidurally and 80 mg intravenously and disappeared completely after dose reduction. Treatment trials are presented, the pathophysiology of the myoclonus is discussed.
For treatment of opioid-induced myoclonus a dose reduction or a change of the opioid should be considered as well as symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines or baclofen.
Hemolytic anemia and possible aplastic crisis with symptoms including jaundice, general fatigue and dark urine developed in a man being treated only by lansoprazole. Five days later, he was treated with antibiotics. The next day, he was admitted to our hospital because of jaundice. On admission, the hemoglobin was 14.0 g/dl, reticulocyte count 8/1000, platelets 79 x 10(9)/l and total bilirubin 12.4 mg/dl (indirect bilirubin 9.5 mg/dl). The above medications were discontinued. The direct Coombs antiglobulin test was positive. Examination of the complement revealed a C3 fiter at the upper limit of normal and an increased C4 and CH50. Three days after admission, he had a severe anemia. The hemoglobin was 3.3 g/DL. We thought it possible that aplastic crisis had followed the hemolytic anemia induced by lansoprazole. He was treated with blood transfusions and corticosteroids. He recovered from anemia within three weeks. Exhaustive studies to identify the cause of the hemolytic anemia were undertaken with negative results. We detected IgG antibody to lansoprazole. We believe that the hemolytic anemia was induced by lansoprazole.
8 patients with paludism diagnosis due to Plasmodium vivax and deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase that should receive antipaludism radical treatment with primaquine were studied. It was determined that 87.5% of the patients presented hemolysis but its relation with the enzymatic activity was not significant (p > 0.05). 50% of the patients could not finish their treatment because of the appearance of important hemolysis. It is concluded that primaquine should not be used indiscriminately among those patients with deficit of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase.
To examine the activity and safety of two sequentially scheduled chemotherapy regimens comprising four cycles of paclitaxel (pctx) 200 mg/m2/3 hours then four cycles ofcisplatin (cisDDP) 100 mg/m2, and vice versa, in patients with previously untreated advanced ovarian cancer.
Between January 1994 and February 1996, we recruited 30 patients to the pctx-then-cisDDP regimen and 29 to cisDDP-then-pctx, in parallel phase II trials.
Both regimens were predictably active with responses seen in 22 of 30 patients (OR 74%; CR 27%, PR 47%) treated with pctx-then-cisDDP, as against 13 of 21 patients (OR 62%; CR 38%, PR 24%) treated with cisDDP-then-pctx. The OR rate to four cycles of pctx (induction) was 43%, with 27% disease progression; the OR to four cycles of cisDDP (induction) was 57%, with 5% progression. However, progression rates across both induction and consolidation phases were 16% (pctx-then-cisDDP) and 29% (cisDDP-then-pctx). Both regimens were unacceptably neurotoxic. II patients suffering grade 3 sensory neurotoxicity (5 on pctx-then-cisDDP, 6 on cisDDP-then-pctx) and 20 having grade 3 deafness (9 on pctx- then-cisDDP, 11 on cisDDP-then-pctx).
The activity of these sequential regimens justifies their further development using the less neurotoxic platinum analogue carboplatin, perhaps combining paclitaxel with other platinum non-cross resistant drugs.
We tested if endothelial function and estrogen receptor (ER) expression differs between resistance arteries in subcutaneous circulation from postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease (CHD, congruent with 1 year after myocardial infarction, n=12) and aged matched controls (n=14); and if acute effects of phytoestrogens (genistein, resveratrol) could be of relevance for vascular protection. We utilized ex vivo small artery ( congruent with 350 microm) bioassays and found no difference in bradykinin (BK)-mediated dilatation between the groups. One-hour incubation with phytoestrogens (natural ER beta agonists), propyl-pyrazole-triol-trisphenol (PPT-selective ER alpha agonist) and 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E(2)-ER alpha/beta agonist) at 0.01 microM/L had no effect on BK-induced responses. Concentration-response curves (0.01-30 microM/L) to investigated compounds were also obtained and compared in separate arteries. We found that dilatation to phytoestrogens was enhanced in CHD if compared to controls (p<0.05), while responses to 17beta-E(2) remained similar. The dilatation to phytoestrogens was also higher if compared to 17beta-E(2) (p<0.05) in CHD. In controls, only responses to PPT, but not to phytoestrogens, were enhanced in comparison to 17beta-E(2) (p<0.05). Inhibition of NO synthase had no effect on dilatation induced by increasing concentrations of investigated compounds. ER beta expression was enhanced in the vascular wall from CHD women, while ER alpha predominated in the controls (p<0.05). We suggest that diet supplementation by phytoestrogens may provide cardiovascular benefit for postmenopausal women with CHD. The selective targeting of one of the ER subtype may have implications for women's cardiovascular health.
Several laboratory markers have been described to correlate positively with disease activity of atopic dermatitis (AD). These include soluble adhesion molecules and eosinophil granular proteins. Although the correlation of these parameters with the severity and extent of skin involvement has been repeatedly studied in the past, no systematic investigation has been performed over a lengthy period of time. In addition, no subjective disease parameters recorded by the patient have been included in studies dealing with disease activity.
To assess the validity of different objective and subjective parameters [soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), urinary nitrate excretion (reflecting endogenous nitric oxide formation) and the patients' impressions of pruritus, sleeplessness and skin status] as markers of AD disease activity.
Twenty patients were examined for 1 year and their skin status was evaluated by an established score (SCORAD). sE-selectin, sVCAM-1 and ECP were analysed by commercial test kits. Urinary nitrate concentration was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The subjective parameters, pruritus, sleeplessness and impression of skin status, were recorded by the patients on a visual analogue scale.
In this long-term trial, only sE-selectin and the subjective parameters showed a statistically significant correlation with the SCORAD score.
Our data indicate that basic clinical scoring remains a most effective and relevant method of recording skin disease activity in AD.
We report a case of cirrhosis developing in a man who was heterozygous for alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and who was receiving methotrexate for severe rheumatoid arthritis. The alpha 1-antitrypsin phenotype PiMZ has been associated with cryptogenic cirrhosis. Our patient had no biochemical or histologic evidence of chronic liver disease during the first year of receiving methotrexate. We postulate that the PiMZ state may result in enhanced susceptibility to methotrexate-induced hepatic toxicity and should be screened for if liver function abnormalities occur during methotrexate therapy.
Drug nephrotoxicity is a serious health and economic problem worldwide. Rats can be acutely sensitized to acute kidney injury (AKI) by subnephrotoxic treatments with potentially nephrotoxic drugs. Acquired sensitization to AKI poses a silent risk impossible to diagnose pre-emptively with the technology available at the clinical level. Herein, we hypothesized whether a chronic, subnephrotoxic insult to the kidneys might result in chronically acquired sensitization to AKI, and whether chronic sensitization might be detected through specific urinary markers. To this end, rats were treated with a subtoxic dosage of the experimental nephrotoxin uranyl nitrate (UN) in the drinking water for 21 weeks, or plain water (as control), and then with low-dose gentamicin for 7 days. Renal function and renal tissue damage were evaluated through the experiment. The mild renal damage caused by gentamicin was markedly magnified in rats having received UN chronically, which was evident both at the functional and histological level. Four proteins, namely albumin, hemopexin, transferrin and vitamin D binding protein were increased in the urine in temporal association with the appearance of chronic predisposition. Although further studies are necessary, our results suggest that these proteins might be potentially used as markers of hidden, chronic predisposition to gentamicin nephrotoxicity, in order to appropriately and pre-emptively stratify and handle individuals according to their specific risk in the long term, and to conveniently optimize their life conditions or additional clinical procedures or treatments that might trigger the disease. This might reduce AKI incidence and severity and the associated costs.
