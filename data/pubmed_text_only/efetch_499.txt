As a result of nuclear power plants accidents such as Chernobyl or Fukushima, some people were exposed to external and internal ionizing radiation (IR). Human brain is highly sensitive to IR during fetal and postnatal period when the molecular processes are not completely finished. Various studies have shown that exposure to low doses of IR causes a higher incidence of cognitive impairment. On the other hand, in industrialized countries, people are daily exposed to a number of toxicant pollutants. Exposure to environmental chemicals, such as paraquat (PQ), may potentiate the toxic effects induced by radiation on brain development. In this study, we evaluated the cognitive effects of concomitant exposure to low doses of internal radiation ((137)Cs) and PQ during neonatal brain development. At the postnatal day 10 (PND10), two groups of mice (C57BL/6J) were exposed to (137)Cs (4000 and 8000 Bq/kg) and/or PQ (7 mg/kg). To investigate the spontaneous behavior, learning, memory capacities and anxiety, behavioral tests were conducted in the offspring at two months of age. The results showed that cognitive functions were not significantly affected when (137)Cs or PQ were administered alone. However, alterations in the working memory and anxiety were detected in mice exposed to (137)Cs combined with PQ.
Veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD) is an important complication in children with Wilms' tumour. Although in most patients this complication resolves uneventfully, fatal cases have been reported. Several observations strongly suggest that actinomycin-D is the likeliest cause of VOD in Wilms' tumour, but VOD seems to be rather uncommon in other malignancies treated with chemotherapy including actinomycin-D. The present case of VOD and the review of the literature stress the pathogenetic and clinical implications of VOD in the presence of a Wilms' tumour treated with actinomycin-D, originating in the right kidney. Greater awareness of this 'predisposing factor' may alert paediatricians to the presence of minimal signs of the syndrome.
As the prophylactic use of heparin continues to increase, nurses must be aware that heparin use may cause heparin-induced skin necrosis--a rare but serious complication. Although even more severe complications may occur from heparin use, this discussion will focus on skin necrosis caused by subcutaneous heparin. Should heparin-induced skin necrosis develop, heparin therapy must be discontinued immediately. This case presentation illustrates one patient's reaction to this complication.
We investigated the effect of several K+ channel blockers on the antinociception induced by delta-opioid receptor agonist SNC80 using the paw pressure test, in which pain sensitivity is increased by an intraplantar injection (2 microg) of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Administration of SNC80 (20, 40 and 80 microg/paw) caused a decrease in the hyperalgesia induced by PGE2, in a dose-dependent manner. The possibility of higher dose of SNC80 (80 microg) causing a central or systemic effect was excluded since administration of the drug into the contralateral paw did not elicit antinociception in the right paw. Specific blockers of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, glibenclamide (20, 40 and 80 microg/paw) and tolbutamide (40, 80 and 160 microg/paw), antagonized the peripheral antinociception induced by SNC80 (80 microg). On the other hand, charybdotoxin (2 microg/paw), a large-conductance blocker of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels, and dequalinium (50 microg/paw), a small conductance selective blocker of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels, did not modify the effect of SNC80. This effect also remained unaffected by intraplantar administration of the voltage-dependent K+ channel blockers tetraethylammonium (30 microg/paw) and 4-aminopyridine (10 microg/paw), and of a non-specific K+ channel blocker, cesium (500 microg/paw). This study provides evidence that the peripheral antinociceptive effect of SNC80 result from the activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, and the other K+ channels are not involved.
A case of cardiac tamponade developing over 10 hours after accidental injection of 80 ml iohexol (350 mg i/ml) during an intravenous digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) examination is described.
In this study, we examine the cost effectiveness of carvedilol for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). We use a Markov model to project life expectancy and lifetime medical care costs for a hypothetical cohort of patients with CHF who were assumed alternatively to receive carvedilol plus conventional therapy (digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or conventional therapy alone. Patients on carvedilol were assumed to experience a reduced risk of death and hospitalization for CHF, which is consistent with findings from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program. The benefits of carvedilol were projected under 2 alternative scenarios. In the first ("limited benefits"), benefits were conservatively assumed to persist for 6 months, the average duration of follow-up in these clinical trials, and then end abruptly. In the other ("extended benefits"), they were arbitrarily assumed to persist for 6 months and then decline gradually over time, vanishing by the end of 3 years. We estimated our model using data from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program and other sources. For patients receiving conventional therapy alone, estimated life expectancy was 6.67 years; corresponding figures for those also receiving carvedilol were 6.98 and 7.62 years under the limited and extended benefits scenarios, respectively. Expected lifetime costs of CHF-related care were estimated to be $28,756 for conventional therapy, and $36,420 and $38,867 for carvedilol (limited and extended benefits, respectively). Cost per life-year saved for carvedilol was $29,477 and $12,799 under limited and extended benefits assumptions, respectively. The cost effectiveness of carvedilol for CHF compares favorably to that of other generally accepted medical interventions, even under conservative assumptions regarding the duration of therapeutic benefit.
We describe the first reported case in the literature of bacterial endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecium that was highly resistant to gentamicin. The case is unusual in that it followed a successfully treated Streptococcus sanguis endocarditis. The micro-organism was susceptible only to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin and to agents such as pristinamycin and daptomycin which are not routinely available for treatment. It illustrates the therapeutic dilemma posed by serious infections with such micro-organisms and supports previous observations that early heart valve replacement surgery may be necessary to achieve cure of endocarditis due to enterococci which are highly resistant to gentamicin. It further emphasises the importance of screening for high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci in all life threatening enterococcal infections, including endocarditis, septicaemia and meningitis when aminoglycoside-penicillin synergy is required for successful treatment.
Short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, have various biological activities including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α secretion, via attenuation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. Here, we evaluated the protective effect of oral administration of tributyrin, a prodrug of butyrate, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury in rats.
Rats were divided into four groups: normal control, tributyrin, LPS, and tributyrin/LPS (treated with tributyrin 1 h before LPS). Plasma levels of butyrate and TNF-α, expression of TNF-α, NF-κB, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, and TLR4 mRNA in liver, blood biochemical tests, and histopathological analysis of liver were performed.
Oral tributyrin increased plasma butyrate level in the portal vein to 2.4 mM at 1 h and 0.7 mM at 2.5 h. Tributyrin attenuated NF-κB activation and liver tissue injury associated with LPS injection. The increases in TNF-α level, and hepatic TLR2 mRNA expression were lower in the tributyrin/LPS group. We believe that this study provides the first evidence that orally administered tributyrin increases butyrate level in the hepato-portal system and attenuates liver injury and subsequent inflammatory responses.
Oral tributyrin increased plasma butyrate in the portal vein and attenuated liver injury in endotoxemic rats.
To estimate the prevalence of lead poisoning in children and to identify associated factors, as well as possible local sources of contamination.
A cross-sectional prevalence study conducted in 2006 with a random sample of 97 children age zero to five years from a neighborhood in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. Blood lead levels were measured and a questionnaire administered to collect information on sociodemographics, recycling and dwelling. A preliminary environmental evaluation was carried out with direct analysis of soil and indirect analysis of air pollution with bioindicators to identify possible sources of contamination. To analyze lead concentrations from the different collection sites, for each type of material studied, ANOVA was performed with a Brown-Forsythe adjustment for heteroscedasticity and with Dunnett's T3 procedure for multiple comparisons of unequal variances.
Blood lead levels > 10.0 µg/dL was found in 16.5% of children. Recycling of waste at home, low father's education level, and increased age of children were associated with increase blood lead levels. High lead levels were found in soil, and there was little indication of lead air pollution.
A high prevalence of lead poisoning was identified, and the potential sources of contamination in this community appear related to waste recylcing activities. Studies should be conducted with other populations of Brazilian children and evaluate potential sources of local and general contamination, to accurately characterize this issue in Brazil.
The progress of 178 patients with Parkinson's disease who began treatment with levodopa between November 1969 and December 1972 is reviewed after six years. One hundred and twenty-five patients showed an initial improvement of their individual total disability scores exceeding 25 per cent, but after six years of sustained treatment only 37 patients still obtained similar benefit. By 1978 only five patients had maintained their initial improvement compared to 69 patients after two years therapy; however, 47 patients were still better than before treatment. The overall mortality ratio--the ratio of observed to expected death rate--for all the patients was 1.45:1. In those patients who unable to tolerate levodopa for longer than two years the ratio was 2.38:1; in those who were able to tolerate sustained medication, life expectancy was normal (ratio of 0.91:1 for males and 1.14:1 for females). Involuntary movements were the commonest complication of treatment. Three main types were distinguished. Peak dose dyskinesias, beginning 20 to 90 minutes after an oral dose and most severe midway through the inter-dose period, affected 80 per cent of patients. Early morning and end-of-dose dystonia occurred in 20 per cent of patients and biphasic dyskinesia--two distinct episodes of involuntary movements within each inter-dose period--was the least common pattern affecting 3 per cent of patients. Involuntary movements increased in frequency and severity as treatment continued. End-of-dose deterioration ('wearing-off' effect of individual doses) occurred in 65 per cent of patients: unpredictable oscillations in motor performance (the 'on-off' phenomenon) unrelated to the time and dosage of levodopa, occurred in 10 per cent. Psychiatric side effects included toxic confusional states, visual pseudohallucinations and paranoid psychoses and constituted the most frequent reason for stopping medication. Forty (22 per cent) of the patients had suffered severe depression before the onset of disease and levodopa had no sustained antidepressant effect in this group. After six years of treatment with levodopa, 32 per cent of the patients had unequivocal dementia.
36 patients with histologically proven grade G1-G2, Ta-T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were introduced, after transurethral resection (TUR), into a study of intravesical chemoprophylaxis with mitoxantrone (20 mg diluted in 50 ml). After a mean follow-up of 23 months, 16 (50%) patients showed a superficial recurrence with a mean recurrence rate of 0.56 per year. In 19 patients with recurring tumours the mean recurrence rate decreased from 1.65 to 0.58 per year. 9 patients (25.7%) suffered from a chemical cystitis that in 2 cases (5.7%) required treatment interruption.
Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is the second most frequent type of malignant tumor of the minor salivary glands. We identified PRKD1 hotspot mutations encoding p.Glu710Asp in 72.9% of PLGAs but not in other salivary gland tumors. Functional studies demonstrated that this kinase-activating alteration likely constitutes a driver of PLGA.
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) represent a group of highly aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas that may occur sporadically, in association with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1 associated) or after radiotherapy. Using comprehensive genomic approaches, we identified loss-of-function somatic alterations of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components (EED or SUZ12) in 92% of sporadic, 70% of NF1-associated and 90% of radiotherapy-associated MPNSTs. MPNSTs with PRC2 loss showed complete loss of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and aberrant transcriptional activation of multiple PRC2-repressed homeobox master regulators and their regulated developmental pathways. Introduction of the lost PRC2 component in a PRC2-deficient MPNST cell line restored H3K27me3 levels and decreased cell growth. Additionally, we identified frequent somatic alterations of CDKN2A (81% of all MPNSTs) and NF1 (72% of non-NF1-associated MPNSTs), both of which significantly co-occur with PRC2 alterations. The highly recurrent and specific inactivation of PRC2 components, NF1 and CDKN2A highlights their critical and potentially cooperative roles in MPNST pathogenesis.
The Aurora kinase family plays pivotal roles in mitotic integrity and cell cycle. We sought to determine the effects of inhibiting Aurora kinase on ovarian cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse model using a small molecule pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor, MK-0457.
We examined cell cycle regulatory effects and ascertained the therapeutic efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibition both alone and combined with docetaxel using both in vitro and in vivo ovarian cancer models.
In vitro cytotoxicity assays with HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 cells revealed >10-fold greater docetaxel cytotoxicity in combination with MK-0457. After in vivo dose kinetics were determined using phospho-histone H3 status, therapy experiments with the chemosensitive HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 as well as the chemoresistant HeyA8-MDR and A2780-CP20 models showed that Aurora kinase inhibition alone significantly reduced tumor burden compared with controls (P values<0.01). Combination treatment with docetaxel resulted in significantly improved reduction in tumor growth beyond that afforded by docetaxel alone (P <or= 0.03). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry revealed that MK-0457 alone and in combination with docetaxel significantly reduced cellular proliferation (P values<0.001). Compared with controls, treatment with MK-0457 alone and in combination with docetaxel also significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis by approximately 3-fold (P<0.01). Remarkably, compared with docetaxel monotherapy, MK-0457 combined with docetaxel resulted in significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis.
Aurora kinase inhibition significantly reduces tumor burden and cell proliferation and increases tumor cell apoptosis in this preclinical orthotopic model of ovarian cancer. The role of Aurora kinase inhibition in ovarian cancer merits further investigation in clinical trials.
A case of Q-T interval prolongation in a pediatric patient with no known risk factors for the development of a long Q-T syndrome is reported.
A 16-year-old boy arrived at a children's hospital reporting mucous diarrhea that had lasted two weeks, light-headedness with two blackouts on the day before his arrival to the hospital, and a 4.3-kg weight loss over the previous three weeks. He had a 3.5-year history of Crohn's disease and had been hospitalized for two months with a diagnosis of colitis with cryptitis. He was admitted for the treatment of an acute flare of Crohn's disease and a perirectal abscess. The patient was started on i.v. ciprofloxacin 400 mg twice daily and metronidazole 500 mg every six hours. The selected agents provided adequate empirical coverage of the suspected organisms and would not be contraindicated with the patient's allergy to penicillin. Within 48 hours of administration of ciprofloxacin, the patient became bradycardic. The cardiology service was consulted, and an electrocardiogram showed a mildly prolonged Q-T interval (corrected Q-T interval, 486 msec) and low heart rate (42 beats/min). Antimicrobial therapy was changed to ampicillin and then to linezolid. The patient's Q-T interval normalized within seven days of ciprofloxacin discontinuation. The patient had no further cardiac anomalies. Two weeks later, he was discharged on linezolid and aztreonam for the treatment of his abscess and was responding to treatment.
A pediatric patient with Crohn's disease and colitis with cryptitis developed a prolonged Q-T interval within 48 hours of treatment with ciprofloxacin.
Esophageal cancer is common worldwide, with poor prognosis. Smoking, including exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons like benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), is a major risk factor. In human esophageal HET-1A cells, we found that time-dependent BaP-DNA binding was associated with upregulation of CYP1B1, but not CYP1A1, mRNA and protein. The dietary flavonoid 5,7-dimethoxyflavone significantly inhibited BaP-DNA binding and down-regulated BaP-induced CYP1B1 mRNA and protein. 3',4'-Dimethoxyflavone was an even more potent inhibitor of CYP1B1 expression, while resveratrol had no effect. Thus, dietary methoxylated flavones inhibited BaP-induced CYP1B1 transcription in a cell-specific manner and hold promise as chemopreventive agents in esophageal carcinogenesis.
Potentiation occurs when the steroidal muscle relaxant, rocuronium, is coadministered with the benzylisoquinolinium relaxant, mivacurium. The effect of time and age on this interaction was evaluated in four predetermined groups: children, adolescents, young adults, and elderly adults (15 per group) by monitoring the ulnar nerve-evoked force of contraction of the adductor pollicis (twitch response). During recovery from paralysis induced by 800 micrograms/kg of rocuronium, an infusion of mivacurium was started and maintained for at least 90 minutes to retain the twitch response at 1% to 9% of baseline tension (95 +/- 4% paralysis). Rocuronium at 600 micrograms/kg induced greater than 95% paralysis in 57 of the 60 patients within 2.2 +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SE) minutes. The period of recovery from rocuronium-induced paralysis to 5% of baseline twitch height was longest in the elderly (30.1 +/- 2.9 minutes) and shortest in the adolescents (16.5 +/- 2.4 minutes). The mivacurium infusion requirements to maintain 95 +/- 4% paralysis was highest in children and progressively increased with time. In young and elderly adults, the infusion rates remained lower than that of children and did not change with time. The incidence of satisfactory spontaneous recovery within 20 minutes (train-of-four ratio > 75%) was the highest in children, followed by adolescents and young adults, and was least in the elderly. The residual neuromuscular effect of rocuronium on the subsequent mivacurium infusion was most pronounced in the elderly, followed by young adults, then adolescents, and was least in children.
Microdeletions of the long arm of the Y chromosome involving the azoospermia factor (AZF) region are associated with severe oligo- or azoospermia. Abnormal androgen receptor (AR) structure or function has also been implicated in male infertility. To assess the contribution of these genetic defects to male infertility, 61 Israeli men with severe oligo- (n = 15) or azoospermia (n = 46), were screened for Y chromosome microdeletions, and the AR-(CAG)n repeat length. Fifty fertile Israeli men were similarly analyzed. PCR amplification of 20-54 simple tag sequences (STSs) located at Yq was used to determine the rate and extent of Y chromosome microdeletions. PCR with primers flanking the AR-(CAG)n region and subsequent size fractionation on gradient acrylamide gels were used to determine AR-(CAG)n length. Five azoospermic individuals (5/61-8.2% and 5/46-10.8% of azoospermic patients) displayed Y chromosome microdeletions. The mean CAG repeat number in infertile men was 18.6 +/- 3.0 compared with 16.6 + 2.7 in fertile men (n = 50), a statistically significant difference (p = 0.003). Y chromosome microdeletions contribute to male infertility in our azoospermic population, and the mean length of the AR-CAG is significantly longer in our infertile population than in fertile men.
Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural product shown to inhibit carcinogen-induced pre-neoplastic lesions in mouse mammary organ culture and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-promoted mouse skin tumors. Application of TPA to mouse skin induces oxidative stress, as evidenced by numerous biochemical responses, including significant generation of H2O2 and enhanced levels of myeloperoxidase and oxidized glutathione reductase activities and decreases in glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity. TPA treatment also elevates the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), c-myc, c-fos, c-jun, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). As currently reported, pre-treatment of mouse skin with resveratrol negated several of these TPA-induced effects in a dose-dependent manner. H2O2 and glutathione levels were restored to control levels, as were myeloperoxidase, oxidized glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase activities. As judged by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), TPA-induced increases in the expression of c-fos and TGF-beta1 were selectively inhibited. These data suggest that resveratrol inhibits tumorigenesis in mouse skin through interference with pathways of reactive oxidants and possibly by modulating the expression of c-fos and TGF-beta1.
This paper aims to discuss the relationship between morbid jealousy, stalking behaviour, and psychodynamic issues. Comment will be made on the risk associated with diagnosis of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and use of psychostimulants.
A man born in the former Yugoslavia charged with stalking was referred for assessment. He presented with a history of treatment for ADHD with dexamphetamine and delusions regarding his wife's fidelity.
The patient was treated with neuroleptics and counselling for himself and his family.
The patient was returned to the community. He separated from his wife but retains the abnormal belief.
The diagnosis of adult ADHD appears to be increasing in Western Australia. Treatment with stimulants is common. The misdiagnosis of ADHD and consequent misuse of stimulants, can lead to the development of morbid jealousy, stalking behaviour and arrest.
ACTH 1 mg/day for 5 days raises systolic blood pressure (SBP) in normotensive and hypertensive subjects on a fixed electrolyte intake of 100 mmol/day sodium (Na) and potassium (K) (Whitworth et al. 1983). The present study examined the effect of Na intake in the high normal range on the haemodynamic and metabolic responses to ACTH. ACTH administration on a 200-300 mmol Na intake increased SBP by 35 mmHg (s.e.m. = 11, n = 5) compared with the 22 mmHg (s.e.m. = 4, n = 12) rise seen on a 100 mmol Na intake in our previous study. These studies suggest that the effects of adrenocortical steroids on blood pressure in man may be magnified by increasing dietary Na intake.
