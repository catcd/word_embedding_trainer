In vitro experiments have proposed a role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a transcription factor, in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and protection against apoptosis. Currently, the net effect on cardiac remodeling in vivo under common stress stimuli is unclear.
We have generated mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted expression of the NF-kappaB super-repressor IkappaBalphaDeltaN (DeltaN(MHC)) using the Cre/lox technique. DeltaN(MHC) mice displayed an attenuated hypertrophic response compared with control mice on infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II) or isoproterenol by micro-osmotic pumps, as determined by echocardiography (left ventricular wall dimensions: control plus Ang II, x1.5+/-0.1 versus sham; DeltaN(MHC) plus Ang II, x1.1+/-0.1 versus sham; P<0.05; n> or =9), heart weight, and histological analysis. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed significantly reduced expression of hypertrophy markers beta-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic peptide in Ang II-treated DeltaN(MHC) mice (P<0.05 versus control plus Ang II; n=4). Neither cardiomyocyte apoptosis nor left ventricular dilatation was observed. In cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes, NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was increased by both Ang II- and interleukin-6-related cytokines. The latter are known to be released by cardiac fibroblasts on Ang II stimulation and thus could locally increase the NF-kappaB response of cardiomyocytes. Finally, results from in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest a role for NF-kappaB in the regulation of prohypertrophic interleukin-6 receptor gp130 on mRNA levels.
These results indicate that targeted inhibition of NF-kappaB in cardiomyocytes in vivo is sufficient to impair Ang II- and isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy without increasing the susceptibility to apoptosis.
Headache induced by acute exposure to a specific drug constitutes an idiosyncratic side effect. Metabolic imbalance appears as the leading aetiology, among several other hypotheses. Either primary headaches show a higher susceptibility to this idiosyncratic reaction or a drug-induced primary headache evolves in intensity and duration, becoming uncontrolled until the complete discontinuation of the drug in consideration. The goal of this study is to describe three patients diagnosed with migraine and epilepsy (both under control) who evolved into status migrainosus after the introduction of oxcarbazepine (OXC), as part of a switch off from carbamazepine (CBZ). Twenty-four to seventy-two hours following the switch, all patients developed intractable headache, despite the use of different symptomatic drugs. Complete recovery of the headache symptoms occurred only after OXC was discontinued. We discuss the potential mechanisms associated to OXC and status migrainosus, drug-induced headaches and uncontrolled headaches.
The effect of three non-ionic contrast media (iosimide, iopamidol and iopromide) was investigated in rabbits and rats after single i.v. application up to high doses with regard to renal changes. Determinations of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and urinary enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase) as well as histological examinations of the kidneys were performed. The results obtained demonstrate that rabbit as an experimental animal was more sensitive than rat in exhibiting renal changes to contrast media. Furthermore, determinations of urinary enzymes demonstrated that gamma-GT in rabbits and LDH in rats were the most sensitive indicators for detection of early kidney damage. With regard to the high dose levels required, these kidney changes do not indicate any risk to humans at diagnostic dose levels.
Following seizures, heat shock protein (HSP)-70 is induced in various brain regions. Since zinc that can induce HSP-70 in various cell systems is enriched in certain glutamatergic terminals and translocates to postsynaptic neurons with seizures, we examined the possibility that HSP-70 induction in the epileptic brain is mediated by synaptic zinc. Adult rats were injected intraperitoneally with kainate to induce seizures. Seizures were halted 3 h after the kainate administration by the injection of phenytoin. Staining of brain sections with zinc-specific fluorescent dye TFL at 24 h after the kainate injection revealed a one-to-one correlation between dense TFL fluorescence and acidophilic neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus. Subsequent staining with anti-HSP-70 antibody, however, revealed that more numerous neurons than degenerating neurons exhibited HSP-70 immunoreactivity. Most of the HSP-70(+) neurons were not stained with acid fuchsin but exhibited mild zinc fluorescence in the cytoplasm. Intraventricular injection of CaEDTA attenuated neuronal death as well as the HSP-70 induction in a dose-dependent manner. Supporting the specificity of zinc rather than calcium as the inducer of HSP-70 in neurons, exposure to zinc but not to a calcium ionophore or excitotoxins increased expression of HSP-70 mRNA and protein in cultured cortical neurons. The present results suggest that not only selective neuronal death, but also HSP-70 induction in neurons after seizures, is mediated by the translocation of endogenous synaptic zinc.
Since it had been demonstrated that L5418 has an anti-convulsant effect with no relation to its anti-inflammatory properties, comparative studies were carried out with the use of currently available anti-convulsant agents as controls. L-5418 inhibited tonic convulsions induced by maximal electroshock and strychinine in mice and prevented animals from the death sequence. L-5418 had an inhibitory effect on tonic convulsions induced by pentetrazol and N-sulfamoyl-hexahydroazepine (SaH 41-178), but not on clonic convulsions by those compounds at even a high dosage or on clonic convulsions induced by picrotoxin and bemegride. Trimethadione produced an inhibitory effect on both tonic and clonic convulsions. The hypnotic agents, phenobarbital and glutethimide inhibited both convulsions, but a higher dose was required in the case of clonic convulsions. Anti-convulsant agents are classified into three different groups according to their mode of action. L-5418 had the same mode of action as seen with diphenylhydantoin and carbamazepine. As L-5418 did not inhibit tremor induced by tremorine, an anti-Parkinson effect was ruled out. When L-5418 was administered alone, the animals did not lose the righting reflex nor show muscle relaxation observed in inclined screen and rotarod tests. Moreover, the compound had no influence on the aggressive behavior induced by electrical stimulation or olfactory bulb ablation. L-5418 possesses a selective anti-convulsant effect, yet has no sedative, tranquilizing or disturbing effects on movement such as equilibrium disturbance or muscle relaxation. L-5418 may prove useful for grand mal epilepsy as it is less toxic than diphenylhydantoin and carbamazepine.
Lipid microspheres (LMs) have recently been use as drug carriers for intravenous use due to its low toxicity, good physiological tolerance and the reduction of the drug related side-effect. In this study, clarithromycin was incorporated in LMs, in an attempt to reduce the pain caused by intravenous use. The composition of the drug loaded LMs was clarithromycin 0.5%, oil phase 10%, soybean phospholipid 2%, egg lecithin 0.5%, Sodium oleate 0.1%. Clarithromycin LMs was prepared by high pressure homogenization method at 80 MPa for 8-10 cycles. The mean particle size and surface charge of LMs were 208.7+/-7.8 nm and -23.6+/-2.3 mv respectively. Clarithromycin entrapment efficiency in LMs was 66.4%. Drug loaded LMs was stable during the storage time at 6+/-2 degrees C for 9 month, and the particle size and zeta-potential did not change significantly. Drug concentration in LMs was 5 mg/mL, and there was no drug degradation during long term storage. Animal tests (rat paw lick test and rabbit ear vein irritation test) were used to evaluate the pain reduction of clarithromycin LMs compared with that of clarithromycin aqueous solution. These results suggest that the LM system is a promising option to replace clarithromycin aqueous solutions as an intravenous treatment.
Potentially preneoplastic hepatocellular hyperplastic foci and hepatocellular neoplasms were studied in weanling male B6C3F1 mice that received a single i.p. injection (80 mg/kg) of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) at 4 weeks of age, followed by oral administration of phenobarbital (PB) or di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) that began 2 weeks after DEN injection and continued for up to 6 months. PB was administered in drinking water at 500 p.p.m. and DEHP in the feed at 3000, 6000 or 12 000 p.p.m. Groups of mice were sacrificed at 2, 4 and 6 months after DEN exposure; formalin-fixed liver samples were evaluated histologically. Hepatocellular neoplasms and foci of hyperplasia were quantified with the aid of an image analysis computer. Few foci were seen at 2, 4 or 6 months in mice exposed to DEN, PB or DEHP alone, while numerous foci and neoplasms were seen in mice given DEHP or PB after DEN. Area-perimeter measurements for each hepatocellular focus or neoplasm transection revealed that foci and neoplasms in PB-exposed mice increased both in size (area and volume) and in number throughout the study. In DEHP-exposed mice the pattern of response was different in that the numbers of foci did not increase between 4 and 6 months, but the foci increased in mean diameter and volume throughout the experiment. Foci and tumors appeared earlier in mice given higher dietary levels of DEHP than in those given lower doses. By the end of the study the number of foci per unit volume of liver was similar in mice given any dose of DEHP, but their volume was dose-related. Hepatocellular foci and neoplasms in PB-exposed mice were composed predominantly of eosinophilic hepatocytes, while in DEHP-exposed mice, basophilic foci and neoplasms predominated; the latter were more malignant in appearance than neoplasms in PB-exposed mice. At 6 months, the neoplasms in high dose DEHP-exposed mice were significantly larger than those in PB exposed mice. Histochemistry, however, revealed similarities between lesions in mice exposed to PB or DEHP. PB given continuously for 6 months revealed no initiating activity of DEHP given once by gavage and followed by PB in drinking water. Both morphology and biology of hepatocellular foci and neoplasms, which develop in mice after a single exposure to a carcinogen with initiating activity, thus depend, in part, on the subsequent promoting agent. More than one process of tumor promotion, as characterized by a specific sequence of morphologic and biochemical changes, is possible for the mouse hepatocyte.
This study investigated the involvement of neutrophil infiltration, disturbances in nitric oxide (NO) generation and oxidative stress in indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer, and the possible gastroprotective potentials of leptin, known for its angiogenic effect. Male Wistar albino rats (180-220 g) were allocated into a normal control group, ulcer control group (received a single dose of indomethacin 40 mg/kg p.o.) and an ulcer group pretreated with leptin (10 microg/kg i.p. 30 min before ulcer induction). The animals were killed 6 h after indomethacin administration and their gastric juice, serum and mucosal tissue were used for gastric injury evaluation. Indomethacin produced multiple lesions in glandular mucosa, evidenced by marked increase in gastric ulcer index (GUI) accompanied by significant increases in gastric juice acidity, tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, serum NO and tissue conjugated diene (CD), and marked decreases in tissue NO and glutathione (GSH) as well as glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, while gastric juice mucin and tissue glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were not affected. Leptin exerted significant gastroprotection as evidenced by significantly decreased GUI and attenuated neutrophil infiltration. Leptin significantly increased mucin and tissue NO, restored GR and SOD activities and up-regulated GPx activity. It failed to affect acidity, serum NO, GSH and CD. These results suggest that leptin confers significant gastroprotection against indomethacin-induced injury through interfering with neutrophil infiltration, NO production and oxidative stress.
A gallbladder mucocele was diagnosed in 2 dogs. In both dogs, the mucocele resolved with medical treatment but without the need for surgical intervention.
A 12-year-old spayed female Miniature Schnauzer had a history of signs of gastrointestinal tract disease and high serum liver enzyme activities. Gallbladder mucocele and hypothyroidism were diagnosed. A 6-year-old neutered mixed-breed dog had chronic intermittent diarrhea and recurrent otitis; gallbladder mucocele and hypothyroidism were diagnosed.
The first dog was treated with S-adenosyl-methionine, omega-3 fatty acids, famotidine, ursodiol, and levothyroxine. Substantial improvement in the gastrointestinal tract condition and complete resolution of the gallbladder mucocele within 3 months were evident, but the dog was not available for further follow-up monitoring. The second dog was treated with fenbendazole, ursodiol, and levothyroxine and fed a hypoallergenic diet. One month after evaluation, abdominal ultrasonography revealed that the gallbladder mucocele was resolving, and treatment was continued. Ultrasonographic evaluation 2 and 4 months later revealed complete resolution of the mucocele.
Review of the clinical course of 2 dogs in which there was nonsurgical resolution of gallbladder mucocele revealed that surgery is not necessary in all dogs with gallbladder mucocele. Hypothyroidism may have resulted in delayed gallbladder emptying, and its role in the pathogenesis of gallbladder mucocele merits investigation. Despite this information, until further prospective trials with a control group and standardized treatments and follow-up monitoring can be performed, the authors recommend surgical intervention for treatment of dogs with gallbladder mucocele.
Air pollution has been suggested to cause genetic damage from investigations of many biological markers that measure cytogenetic damage in humans. Here, we evaluated the genotoxic effects of ambient air pollution by investigating the extent of cytogenetic damage in human blood lymphocytes from rural and industrial female residents of Shenyang city, China, using micronuclei assays and polymorphic analyses of metabolic enzyme and DNA repair genes. After adjustment for potential confounding factors including DNA polymorphisms, industrial female residents were found to have a higher micronuclei frequency. These results provide evidence that micronuclei assays are a sensitive indicator to air pollution-induced genotoxic effects in humans.
NDI occurs in 5% to 20% of patients receiving long-term lithium therapy. The associated polyuria usually resolves within 3 weeks of lithium discontinuance but can persist beyond a year. For such patients, hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride therapy has been hampered by the delayed effect and intrinsic side effects of these agents. We have described the case of a 66-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder treated with lithium who was transferred to the intensive care unit with coma. Indomethacin therapy, at a dose of 50 mg every 8 hours, was begun and improvement of the NDI state was observed within 3 hours of lithium administration. There was complete normalization of mental status and laboratory studies after 36 hours. A complete 3-week course of indomethacin was required to keep the patient free of symptoms of NDI. We have also discussed the role of indomethacin in reversing lithium-induced NDI and reviewed pertinent prior reports in the literature.
A total of 160 men with erectile failure received treatment with 13,030 intracavernosal papaverine and phentolamine injections as outpatients. One-hundred-and-fifteen (72%) achieved an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse and after a mean follow-up period of 14.1 months, 55 (48%) are still attending and successfully using intracavernous therapy. Sixteen patients had a total of 22 episodes of priapism and one patient developed corporeal fibrosis. We conclude that intracavernous papaverine and phentolamine is an effective therapy for erectile failure in a genitourinary clinic.
The present study investigated the effect of diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2 ] on metabolic disorders induced by acephate acute exposure in rats. We also investigated a possible mechanism of action of (PhSe)2 against hyperglycemia induced by acephate. (PhSe)2 was administered to rats at a dose of 10 or 30 mg/kg by oral gavage (p.o.) 1 hour prior to acephate administration (140 mg/kg; p.o.). Glucose and corticosterone levels as well as the lipid status were determined in plasma of rats. Cardiovascular risk factors and the atherogenic index were calculated. Glycogen levels as well as tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activities were determined in livers of rats. Cerebral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was assayed. Acephate induced an increase in glucose and corticosterone levels as well as in TAT and G6Pase activities. AChE activity was inhibited by acephate. Triglyceride (TG) levels and the cardiovascular risk factor TG/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL) were increased by acephate. (PhSe)2 was effective against the metabolic disorders induced by acephate acute exposure in rats.
Disruption of signaling pathways such as those mediated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) or platelet-derived growth factor (Pdgf) causes craniofacial abnormalities, including cleft palate. The role that microRNAs play in modulating palatogenesis, however, is completely unknown. We show that, in zebrafish, the microRNA Mirn140 negatively regulates Pdgf signaling during palatal development, and we provide a mechanism for how disruption of Pdgf signaling causes palatal clefting. The pdgf receptor alpha (pdgfra) 3' UTR contained a Mirn140 binding site functioning in the negative regulation of Pdgfra protein levels in vivo. pdgfra mutants and Mirn140-injected embryos shared a range of facial defects, including clefting of the crest-derived cartilages that develop in the roof of the larval mouth. Concomitantly, the oral ectoderm beneath where these cartilages develop lost pitx2 and shha expression. Mirn140 modulated Pdgf-mediated attraction of cranial neural crest cells to the oral ectoderm, where crest-derived signals were necessary for oral ectodermal gene expression. Mirn140 loss of function elevated Pdgfra protein levels, altered palatal shape and caused neural crest cells to accumulate around the optic stalk, a source of the ligand Pdgfaa. These results suggest that the conserved regulatory interactions of mirn140 and pdgfra define an ancient mechanism of palatogenesis, and they provide candidate genes for cleft palate.
We followed our initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 527,869 SNPs on 1,172 individuals with prostate cancer and 1,157 controls of European origin-nested in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial prospective study-by testing 26,958 SNPs in four independent studies (total of 3,941 cases and 3,964 controls). In the combined joint analysis, we confirmed three previously reported loci (two independent SNPs at 8q24 and one in HNF1B (formerly known as TCF2 on 17q); P < 10(-10)). In addition, loci on chromosomes 7, 10 (two loci) and 11 were highly significant (between P < 7.31 x 10(-13) and P < 2.14 x 10(-6)). Loci on chromosome 10 include MSMB, which encodes beta-microseminoprotein, a primary constituent of semen and a proposed prostate cancer biomarker, and CTBP2, a gene with antiapoptotic activity; the locus on chromosome 7 is at JAZF1, a transcriptional repressor that is fused by chromosome translocation to SUZ12 in endometrial cancer. Of the nine loci that showed highly suggestive associations (P < 2.5 x 10(-5)), four best fit a recessive model and included candidate susceptibility genes: CPNE3, IL16 and CDH13. Our findings point to multiple loci with moderate effects associated with susceptibility to prostate cancer that, taken together, in the future may predict high risk in select individuals.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting males in developed countries. It shows consistent evidence of familial aggregation, but the causes of this aggregation are mostly unknown. To identify common alleles associated with prostate cancer risk, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using blood DNA samples from 1,854 individuals with clinically detected prostate cancer diagnosed at </=60 years or with a family history of disease, and 1,894 population-screened controls with a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration (<0.5 ng/ml). We analyzed these samples for 541,129 SNPs using the Illumina Infinium platform. Initial putative associations were confirmed using a further 3,268 cases and 3,366 controls. We identified seven loci associated with prostate cancer on chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 19 and X (P = 2.7 x 10(-8) to P = 8.7 x 10(-29)). We confirmed previous reports of common loci associated with prostate cancer at 8q24 and 17q. Moreover, we found that three of the newly identified loci contain candidate susceptibility genes: MSMB, LMTK2 and KLK3.
To evaluate the substances associated with medication overuse headache (MOH) in a headache center, over the course of the past 15 years.
The acute treatment of migraine has substantially changed over the past 15 years, and therefore, the substances associated with MOH may have changed as well.
We randomly reviewed charts of subjects seen during the years of 2005, 2000, 1995, and 1990, to identify substances associated with MOH. Since the criteria proposed by the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders require causal attribution, demonstrated by improvement after withdrawal (and this was not assessed in this study), herein we refer to probable MOH (PMOH). We contrasted the substances associated with PMOH over the studied years.
Our sample consists of 1200 individuals, 300 per year of interest. The proportions of subjects with a diagnosis of PMOH remained stable over the years, varying from 64% of all cases seen in the center in 1990, to 59.3% in 2005. We found a significant decrease in the relative frequency of probable ergotamine overuse headache (from 18.6% to 0%, P < .0001), and in probable combination analgesic overuse headache (from 42.2% to 13.6%, P < .0001). The differences were not significant for opioid overuse headache. The relative frequency increased significantly for the triptans (from 0% to 21.6%, P < .0001), simple analgesics (from 8.8% to 31.8%, P < .05), and for combinations of acute medications (from 9.8% to 22.7%, P = .01).
While overuse of acute medications remains an important problem in the tertiary care arena, the substances associated with the overuse have dramatically changed over the past 15 years. Educational initiatives should emphasize that the newer specific acute migraine medications (triptans) may also be associated with PMOH.
Diltiazem, a calcium-channel blocker, is an effective antianginal agent, particularly in treating the vasospastic type of angina pectoris. This drug has recently been released for use in the United States. Noncardiac untoward effects of diltiazem are few. We describe a case of mania with psychotic features that occurred while a patient was on diltiazem.
Verapamil is a useful drug for treating supraventricular tachycardia; however, severe side effects occasionally have been reported in infants. We describe here our experience with the use of a 10 percent solution of intravenous calcium gluconate prior to the use of verapamil in infants with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. In all the attacks verapamil converted the supraventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm. We feel that calcium gluconate injected previous to verapamil can avoid the negative inotropic effects without interfering with the antiarrhythmic properties of verapamil.
Caffeine dependence is a frequent cause of chronic daily headache. This condition was diagnosed in three men aged 33, 35 and 26 years, respectively, and two women aged 67 and 44 years, respectively. As little as 100 mg caffeine may be enough to cause the headache, i.e. the equivalent of one cup of coffee, one bar of dark chocolate, 2 cups of tea or 2 tablets of an analgesic-coffee combination preparation. The therapy consists of discontinuing the caffeine consumption. Assessment of caffeine use is an important part of the headache anamnesis, especially in the case of morning or weekend headaches, unexplained increase in frequency and duration of episodes, a decreased response to headache medication or chronic daily headache.
Local reactions during and after i.v. injection of two different formulations of diazepam were studied. Two-thirds of the patients felt pain during the injection. Verfied or probable thrombophlebitis occurred with increasing frequency following operation, indicating a late onset. One month after discharge, 29% of those who had received diazepam in glycoferol-alcohol-benzoic acid complained of tender injection sites, compared with only 10% of the patients who received diazepam in cremophor EL. The difference is significant, indicating an influence of the solvent system.
We divided adult mongrel dogs under halothane anesthesia (1 MAC: 0.86%) into the normal group (N-group: no-hemodilution, with Hct 38 +/- 7%) and the hemodilutional group (H-group: normovolemic hemodilution, with Hct 38 +/- 4%-->21 +/- 4%). For dilution of blood, Dextran 70 was used. In both groups, control values of respiratory and circulatory parameters and coronary blood flow (CBF) were measured. We repeated these measurements after animals had been anesthetized by two different methods:halothane hypotensive anesthesia and trinitroglycerine hypotensive anesthesia. Under hypotensive anesthesia with halothane, CI, LV dp/dt max, and LVSWI decreased significantly as compared to control values in both group. CBF also decreased significantly as compared to the control values in both groups. Under trinitroglycerine hypotensive anesthesia, CI, LV dp/dt max and LVSWI decreased significantly from the control values in both groups as observed under halothane hypotensive anesthesia. Differing from these findings, under trinitroglycerine hypotensive anesthesia no difference from the control group was observed in CBF in N-group, while in H-group CBF decreased significantly from the control value. It was indicated from our results that the increase in coronary blood flow induced by trinitroglycerine becomes obscure under hemodilutional state.
Acute or chronic administration of most beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs is associated with a fall in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. In patients with renal insufficiency this effect on renal function may be clinically important. Penbutolol is a non-cardioselective, pure laevo, beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Previous studies have suggested that penbutolol may increase the glomerular filtration rate. In this study eight hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency were studied during a three-week placebo period and then for four weeks while taking penbutolol in a dose of 40 or 80 mg daily. Penbutolol produced a fall in the pulse rate in all eight patients. Five of the eight patients had a fall in their supine and standing blood pressure. Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate did not change significantly. In seven of the eight patients there was a fall in the calculated renal vascular resistance but the mean fall did not reach statistical significance. Penbutolol appears to be an effective beta-blocker and one that could be used appropriately in patients with renal insufficiency.
