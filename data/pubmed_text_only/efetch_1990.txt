To report a case of possible theophylline-induced hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
An 88-year-old man developed severe symptomatic hyponatremia (serum sodium 112 mEq/L) associated with inappropriate natriuresis (urinary sodium 58 mEq/L) temporally related to the initiation of theophylline. The patient fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of SIADH after all other causes of hyponatremia were excluded. Furthermore, no other drugs or conditions that could have evoked SIADH were found.
Theophylline has rarely been associated with hyponatremia. A thiazide-like action of the drug on the stimulation of SIADH could be the underlying mechanism for SIADH.
Theophylline should be considered as a possible cause of hyponatremia.
The antithrombotic properties of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) used at current doses are largely demonstrated. However, our previous study showed unexpected thrombotic potencies associated with the use of this drug. In this study we investigate the effect of aspirin on an experimental thrombosis induced by laser beams, according to its in vivo plasma concentration. Experiments were done on nine groups of seven Wistar male rats. The groups are defined by the delay between aspirin administration time and the laser-induced thrombosis time. Results from this study showed an enhancement of thromboembolic complications when thrombosis was induced 8 or 10 days after aspirin administration; the number of emboli and the duration of embolization are increased, compared to the control group. The prothrombotic properties of ASA demonstrated in this study, might limit its therapeutic benefit and might explain thromboembolic complications observed in some ASA-treated patients. These results also suggest a biological monitoring several days after aspirin administration to patients.
Allergic nephropathy associated with quinolone antibiotics has been reported in an increasing number of cases. The mechanism might be a hypersensitivity reaction. Norfloxacin has been incriminated previously as a cause once only, with acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) as the histopathological finding. Ciprofloxacin-associated nephropathy has been reported in 28 cases, with AIN as the main histopathological finding. This report describes a second case of AIN associated with norfloxacin treatment and another ciprofloxacin-associated renal interstitial drug adverse reaction. Clinicians should be aware of quinolone-associated AIN, which is a rare but potentially dangerous renal complication.
PPAR-α, PPAR-β, and PPAR-γ, and RXR in conjunction with PGC-1α and SIRT1, activate oxidative metabolism genes determining insulin sensitivity. In utero, hypoxia is commonly observed in Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), and reduced insulin sensitivity is often observed in these infants as adults. We sought to investigate how changes in oxygen tension might directly impact muscle PPAR regulation of oxidative genes. Following eight days in culture at 1% oxygen, C(2)C(12) muscle myoblasts displayed a reduction of PGC-1α, PPAR-α, and RXR-α mRNA, as well as CPT-1b and UCP-2 mRNA. SIRT1 and PGC-1α protein was reduced, and PPAR-γ protein increased. The addition of a PPAR-β agonist (L165,041) for the final 24 hours of 1% treatment resulted in increased levels of UCP-2 mRNA and protein whereas Rosiglitazone induced SIRT1, PGC-1α, RXR-α, PPAR-α, CPT-1b, and UCP-2 mRNA and SIRT1 protein. Under hypoxia, Resveratrol induced SIRT1, RXR-α, PPAR-α mRNA, and PPAR-γ and UCP-2 protein. These findings demonstrate that hypoxia alters the components of the PPAR pathway involved in muscle fatty acid oxidative gene transcription and translation. These results have implications for understanding selective hypoxia adaptation and how it might impact long-term muscle oxidative metabolism and insulin sensitivity.
Many chemotherapeutic agents are believed to kill cancer cells by inflicting cellular damage which triggers the cell to enter apoptosis (programmed cell death). We investigated the means by which carboplatin induces cell death in three model cancer systems: the human prostate carcinoma cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP and the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa.
Drug cytotoxicity, cell cycle effects, bcl-2 deactivation, and multiple markers for apoptosis were utilized to examine carboplatin activity within these cell lines.
In HeLa cells, carboplatin appears to induce an S-phase block followed by apoptosis. In contrast, PC-3 and LNCaP cells show no cell cycle phase block and die from necrosis rather than apoptosis. The effects of carboplatin contrast sharply with the effects of paclitaxel, which induces an M-phase block and apoptosis in all three cell lines.
These results show that PC-3 and LNCaP cells are relatively resistant to carboplatin and suggest two causes of resistance: bypassing the cell cycle checkpoints which serve as points of entry into apoptosis, and incomplete execution of the effector mechanisms of apoptosis. Carboplatin resistance in the prostate cancer cell lines fits into the developing scheme of apoptosis-necrosis and raises valuable questions about the root causes of cancer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
A 85 year old lady suffering from depression is described. The depression was caused by digoxin intoxication. At first this was not recognized because of the low level of creatinine in the serum. This was the result of the decreased lean body mass, the patient weighing only 40 kilo!
We examine two cases of prolonged neuromuscular blockade (NMB) after cardiac surgery. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of complete paralysis lasting more than ten hours after surgery.
We attribute the extended durations of NMB (more than ten hours) to high doses of NMB drugs in combination with magnesium sulphate and moderate renal failure. Advanced age, hepatic disease, aminoglycoside exposure, hypocalcemia, and possible interaction between rocuronium and pancuronium may have played minor roles.
We should avoid administering large doses of NMB agents, even in the context of planned postoperative ventilation. If NMB is not monitored intraoperatively in patients who are at risk of prolonged NMB, then train-of-four response should be measured in the intensive care unit. Adequate sedation should be provided until proper recovery of neuromuscular function is documented.
Results from open-label trials suggest that methotrexate (MTX) and leflunomide (LEF) are effective for maintenance of remission in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), but data from randomized controlled clinical trails are not yet available.
In this multicentre, prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, patients with generalized WG were treated either with oral LEF 30 mg/day or oral MTX (starting with 7.5 mg/week reaching 20 mg/week after 8 weeks) for 2 yrs following induction of remission with cyclophosphamide. The primary endpoint was the incidence of relapses. Secondary outcome parameters were DEI, BVAS, SF-36, cANCA-titre, ESR and CRP.
Fifty-four patients were included in the study, 26 in the LEF-limb, 28 in the MTX-limb. In the LEF-group, six patients relapsed after a median time of 7 months, thereof one major relapse with a new pulmonary manifestation. In the MTX-group, 13 relapses occurred in 6 months, of which seven were major: rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (n = 4), pulmonary haemorrhage (n = 2) and one cerebral granuloma. The significantly higher incidence of major relapses in the MTX-limb (P = 0.037) led to premature termination of the study. In the LEF-limb, four patients were withdrawn due to hypertension (n = 2), peripheral neuropathy (n = 1) and leucopenia (n = 1).
LEF at a dosage of 30 mg/day appears to be effective in the prevention of major relapses in WG, however, this is associated with an increased frequency of adverse events. Further studies testing other dosing regimens of lower doses of LEF are needed to confirm these promising results in larger patients cohorts.
In hypothermic rats with acute hypertension induced by intravenous injection of adrenalin, regional changes in blood-brain barrier permeability to macromolecules were investigated using Evans blue as indication. Evans blue albumin extravasation was determined as a macroscopic finding and a quantitative estimation with a spectrophotometer using homogenized brain to release the dye was also performed to evaluate the macroscopic findings. Five groups of rats were studied: Group I: normothermia + acute hypertension; Group II: hypothermia + acute hypertension; Group III: control hypothermia; Group IV: normothermia + hypotension; Group V: control normothermia. The rats were anaesthetized with diethyl-ether. Body temperature was lowered by submerging anaesthetized animals in an ice water bath. The colonic temperature was reduced to 20 +/- 1 degrees C. During adrenaline-induced acute hypertension the mean arterial blood pressure increased in both normothermic and hypothermic animals. Blood-brain barrier lesions were present in 40% of normothermic rats, and 60% of hypothermic rats after adrenaline-induced hypertension. Mean value for Evans blue dye in the whole brain was found to be 0.530 +/- 0.202 mg% in the normothermic rats and 0.752 +/- 0.256 mg% in the hypothermic rats during adrenaline-induced hypertension. This difference between normothermic and hypothermic rats was found to be statistically significant (P less than 0.01). Our results showed that the extravasation of Evans blue albumin was most pronounced in the brains of hypothermic rats compared to normothermic rats after adrenaline-induced acute hypertension.
Malignant breast cancer cells often exhibit lower expression and activity of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) than their normal cell counterparts; however, the mechanism(s) responsible for this change remains unclear. We examined whether SOD2, the gene encoding MnSOD, was epigenetically repressed in breast cancer cell lines by DNA methylation and histone acetylation. RT-PCR analysis of SOD2 mRNA showed the nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A to have two to three fold higher expression levels than either UACC-893 or MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells. Analysis of a region in the SOD2 promoter by sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing demonstrated significantly higher levels of CpG methylation in both human breast carcinoma cell lines assessed than in MCF-10A cells. CREB binding in vitro to a cognate site derived from this region was repressed by DNA methylation, and CREB binding to the 5' regulatory region of the SOD2 gene in vivo as determined by ChIP was significantly lower in breast carcinoma cells than in MCF-10A. Increased cytosine methylation was also accompanied by a significant decrease in the level of acetylated histones in the same region of the SOD2 promoter. Finally, a causal link between cytosine methylation and transcriptional repression was established by increasing MnSOD mRNA, protein and activity in breast carcinoma cells using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. These findings indicate that epigenetic silencing of SOD2 constitutes one mechanism leading to the decreased expression of MnSOD observed in many breast cancers.
We evaluated clinical toxicity in HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Uganda.
From May 2003 through December 2004, adults with a CD4 cell count < or =250 cells/microL or World Health Organization stage 3/4 HIV disease were prescribed ART. We calculated probabilities for time to toxicity and single-drug substitution as well as multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for development of toxicity.
ART (stavudine plus lamivudine with nevirapine [96%] or efavirenz [4%]) was prescribed for 1029 adults, contributing 11,268 person-months of observation. Toxicities developed in 543 instances in 411 (40%) patients (incidence rate = 4.47/100 person-months): 36% peripheral neuropathy (9% severe); 6% rash (2% severe); 2% hypersensitivity reaction; < or =0.5% acute hepatitis, anemia, acute pancreatitis, or lactic acidosis; and 13% other. Probabilities of remaining free from any toxicity at 6, 12, and 18 months were 0.76, 0.59, and 0.47 and from any severe toxicity at 6, 12, and 18 months were 0.92, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively. For 217 patients (21%), 222 single-drug substitutions were made, mostly because of peripheral neuropathy or rash.
Clinical toxicities were common, but no patients discontinued ART because of toxicity. The most common toxicities, peripheral neuropathy and rash, were managed with single-drug substitutions. In resource-limited settings, toxicity from ART regimens containing stavudine or nevirapine is manageable but more tolerable regimens are needed.
In order to test the possible cardiac-sparing effect of doxorubicin administered by six-hour intravenous infusion and to prospectively evaluate the role of resting left ventricular ejection fraction in monitoring these patients, 33 women with advanced breast cancer were treated with combination chemotherapy containing 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. Doxorubicin was administered via a femoral catheter as a six-hour infusion. Cardiac function was monitored prior to therapy and at intervals during therapy by history and physical examination and by measurement of resting left ventricular ejection fraction with gated pool radionuclide angiography. Twenty-six responses were observed (complete response, seven [21 percent]; partial response, 19 [57 percent]). Systemic toxicity included alopecia, myelosuppression, and nausea and vomiting. There was a progressive fall in resting left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment from a median baseline value of 0.63. Mean fall from baseline left ventricular ejection fraction at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 200 to 300 mg/m2 was 0.06 (p less than 0.005); at 301 to 449 mg/m2 it was 0.09 (p less than 0.0005); and at 450 mg/m2 or greater it was 0.15 (p less than 0.0005). Clinical congestive heart failure developed in three patients. Even though the decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction was often within the "normal range" (left ventricular ejection fraction 0.50 or greater), these changes were progressive and appeared to be part of a continuum of doxorubicin-induced myocardial damage. Steady-state infusion levels of doxorubicin in plasma ranged from 90 to 120 nM. They confirm the hypothesis that lower concentrations can be achieved by continuous infusion rather than by bolus infusion. In this study, however, administration of doxorubicin by six-hour infusion did not appear to have a major cardiac-sparing effect. Studies of anthracycline cardiac toxicity should include determination of baseline left ventricular ejection fraction and serial observations during therapy. Failure to include deteriorations in function above an arbitrary cutoff point or to make observations only at higher cumulative doses may underestimate drug-induced myocardial damage.
Chloroquine and colchicine, widely used in internal medicine practice for a variety of inflammatory diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behçet's disease, may induce neuromuscular complications. Physicians must be familiar with this diagnosis as this iatrogenic neuromuscular pathology may simulate polymyositis, leading thus to inappropriate treatment with prednisone whereas the only effective treatment is to discontinue the drug involved whenever possible. We report three cases of toxic myopathy and/or neuropathy related to chronic chloroquine or colchicine therapy for systemic diseases, and outline the main points to be considered in this situation.
Excessive exposure to manganese (Mn) increases levels of oxidative stressors and proinflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E(2). Mn also activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), an important mediator of inflammation. The signaling molecule 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J(2) (15 d-PGJ(2)) is an anti-inflammatory prostaglandin. Here, we tested the hypothesis that 15 d-PGJ(2) modulates Mn-induced activation of astrocytic intracellular signaling, including NF-κB and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), a master regulator of antioxidant transcriptional responses. The results establish that 15 d-PGJ(2) suppresses Mn-induced NF-κB activation by interacting with several signaling pathways. The PI3K/Akt pathway, which is upstream of NF-κB, plays a role in this activation, because (i) pretreatment with 15 d-PGJ(2) (10 μM for 1h) significantly (p<0.01) inhibited Mn (500 μM)-induced PI3K/Akt activation and (ii) inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY29004 significantly (p<0.05) decreased NF-κB activation. 15 d-PGJ(2) also significantly (p<0.05) attenuated Mn-induced astrocytic NF-κB activation by inhibiting the Mn-induced phosphorylation of IκB kinase and subsequent IκB-α degradation. Because Mn-induced oxidative stress is also associated with Nrf2 activation, additional studies addressed the ability of 15 d-PGJ(2) to modulate the Nrf2 pathway. 15 d-PGJ(2) significantly (p<0.01) increased Nrf2 expression in whole-cell lysates. Consistent with its pro-oxidant properties, Mn also increased Nrf2 expression. Nevertheless, cotreatment of whole-cell lysates with both Mn and 15 d-PGJ(2) partially suppressed (p<0.01) the 15 d-PGJ(2)-induced increase in astrocytic Nrf2 protein expression. Mn treatment also decreased (p<0.001) expression of DJ-1, a Parkinson disease-associated protein and a stabilizer of Nrf2, and 15 d-PGJ(2) attenuated Mn-induced astrocytic inhibition of DJ-1 expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that 15d-PGJ(2) exerts a protective effect in astrocytes against Mn-induced inflammation and oxidative stress by modulating the activation of the NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling pathways.
We report the chance observation of two generalized seizures in a fetal lamb that received cocaine. Cocaine was infused intravenously into a 138-day-old fetus while electrocortical (ECoG), electroocular (EOG), and neck electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded. Fetal rapid eye movement (REM) and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were disrupted during the cocaine exposure and returned to a normal pattern after infusions were stopped. Seventy-two hours later, however, we recorded generalized seizures with ECoG spike and spike wave activity.
Epileptic seizures may be an early symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus, while at the same time some of the epileptic drugs, namely carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), valproic acid (VPA), ethosuximide (ETM), primidone (PRM), lamotrigine (LTG), zonisamide (ZNS) can cause lupus. A separate clinical problem is the fact that few cases of systemic lupus have as yet been identified by giving antiepileptic drug. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with frequent simple partial seizures and few secondarily generalized seizures since the age of 18. She was treated with VPA for three years. Then, because of side effects the drug had to be withdrawn and was replaced by CBZ. After eight months duration of the treatment with CBZ, the dose was increased because a secondarily generalized seizure occurred again. After another two months, painful swelling of all joints and leucopenia were observed. During additional studies, LE cells and high titer of ANA antibodies were found. Systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed and prednisone therapy was introduced. In spite of the withdrawal of CBZ, the increased titer of ANA antibodies persisted for several years and skin and muscle biopsy performed five years from the onset of clinical symptoms disclosed inflammatory infiltration and presence of IgG and IgM deposits in skin and vessel walls. Control serological examinations, skin and muscle biopsy carried out after eight years of observation and lack of clinical manifestations permitted to exclude a connective tissue disease in our patient.
This study was aimed at evaluating the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of the ethanol extract of Vitex glabrata (EEVG) in a CCl(4)-induced liver damage model in rats; and to isolate and characterise the bioactive constituent from EEVG. Hepatoprotective activity was evaluated by changes in the levels of the serum enzymes viz. AST, ALT, ALP and total bilirubin, and further by histopathological examinations of liver tissues. Antioxidant activity was measured in terms of superoxide dismutase, GSH, lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase and peroxidase levels in liver homogenate. The pentamethoxy flavonoid artemetin was isolated and characterised from EEVG. Artemetin and EEVG pre-treatment significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited LPO in CCl(4)-intoxicated livers and reduced the elevated serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin to normal; it also brought back the normal architecture of liver tissues. Antioxidant activity of EEVG was found to be comparable with silymarin (p < 0.05). In conclusion, EEVG possesses significant hepatoprotective activity, which may be mediated by the antioxidant mechanisms of its components, predominantly artemetin.
The expression of neurotensin (NT) and its receptor (NTR1) is up-regulated in experimental colitis and inflammatory bowel disease; NT/NTR1 interactions regulate gut inflammation. During active inflammation, metabolic shifts toward hypoxia lead to the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, which enhances vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, promoting angiogenesis. We hypothesized that NT/NTR1 signaling regulates intestinal manifestations of hypoxia and angiogenesis by promoting HIF-1 transcriptional activity and VEGFα expression in experimental colitis. We studied NTR1 signaling in colitis-associated angiogenesis using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-treated wild-type and NTR1-knockout mice. The effects of NT on HIF-1α and VEGFα were assessed on human colonic epithelial cells overexpressing NTR1 (NCM460-NTR1) and human intestinal microvascular-endothelial cells. NTR1-knockout mice had reduced microvascular density and mucosal integrity score compared with wild-type mice after 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid treatment. VEGFα mRNA levels were increased in NCM460-NTR1 cells treated with 10(-7) mol/L NT, at 1 and 6 hours post-treatment. NT exposure in NCM460-NTR1 cells caused stabilization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in a diacylglycerol kinase-dependent manner. NT did not stimulate tube formation in isolated human intestinal macrovascular endothelial cells but did so in human intestinal macrovascular endothelial cells cocultured with NCM460-NTR1 cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of an NTR1-HIF-1α-VEGFα axis in intestinal angiogenic responses and in the pathophysiology of colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
Acute organophosphate poisoning (OPP) such as dichlorvos may be monitored by the measurement of the erythrocyte acetyl cholinesterase (EAChE) and the serum cholinesterase (SChE) activities. The aim of this study was to look at correlation between the severity of the OPP judged by certain parameters such as coma, hemodynamic disturbances, respiratory failure, and the decrease of cholinesterases enzymes including EAChE and SChE at admission. Cholinesterase activity was determined upon admission and then on days 3 and 15 in the morning. Clinical effects, EAChE, and SChE activities data were investigated in 42 patients with OPP aged of 29.6 +/- 11.8 years with acute cholinergic crisis in all cases. They were comatose in 29% of cases, presenting both hypotension or shock and hypoxemia in 17% of cases. Fifteen of them (36%) required mechanical ventilation. The mean EAChE activity at admission was 24.3 +/- 11.6 micromol/mL per hour at 37 degrees C; it was 1260 +/- 2204 IU/L for SChE. There were no correlations between the EAChE and the SChE activities. The EAChE was decreased only in comatose patients and those presenting hypotension, hypoxemia, and bradycardia with a cutoff of 23.5 micromol/mL per hour at 37 degrees C. Death was observed in 2 patients with a deep decrease of the EAChE at 5 micromol/mL per hour at 37 degrees C in 1 case and 9 micromol/mL per hour at 37 degrees C in another. The kinetics of improvement of the EAChE activity below the cutoff showed the absence of statistical improvement of the EAChE activity on day 3 (16.6 +/- 9 vs 19.5 +/- 5.7 micromol/mL per hour at 37 degrees C); this improvement was remarkable on day 15 (16.6 +/- 9 vs 27.5 +/- 6.5micromol/mL per hour at 37 degrees C, P = .0004). In summary, the marked decrease of EAChE activity appears in this study as prognostic factor in acute OPP, and coma, respiratory failure, hemodynamic disturbances, and death are associated with a decrease of the EAChE of less than 23.5 micromol/mL per hour at 37 degrees C.
An acute LPS challenge immediately following day 1 of shuttlebox training triggered exacerbated central IL-1β production and disrupted memory consolidation and/or further acquisition of the task in 18-month-old mice, compared to 4-month-old controls. These deficits cannot be attributed to alterations in sickness behavior. The findings suggest that age and immune activation combine to impair learning and memory consolidation processes, and that increased central IL-1β production may play a role.
The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of mu 1-opioid receptors in morphine reward. Therefore, we studied the ability of a mu 1-selective antagonist, naloxonazine [15 mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP)], to antagonize the conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by morphine [3 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC)]. In addition, effects of naloxonazine on morphine-induced catalepsy (15 mg/kg), analgesia (3 mg/kg), and hyperthermia (3 mg/kg) were studied. For comparison, the effects of a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (2.5 mg/kg SC), and a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist, naltrindole (2 mg/kg IP), on CPP induced by morphine were investigated. Morphine-induced CPP was clearly antagonized by pretreatment with naloxonazine and naltrexone (12 h and 20 min prior to morphine, respectively) but not by naltrindole (15 min before morphine). Naloxonazine also antagonized morphine-induced catalepsy and analgesia but not morphine-induced hyperthermia. Naltrindole did not modify morphine-induced catalepsy. These results suggest an active role for mu 1-opioid receptors in morphine reward, whereas morphine-induced hyperthermia does not appear to be mediated by mu 1-opioid receptors. Furthermore, delta-opioid receptors seem to be without significance in morphine-induced reward.
Twenty-five patients with refractory solid tumors were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and mitoxantrone followed by autologous stem cell rescue in a phase I dose escalation study. The dose-limiting toxic effect was mucositis at 60 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone in combination with cyclophosphamide and thiotepa. The early death rate due to toxic effects was 24%; all deaths were attributed to infections. Hematopoietic recovery was quite prolonged with median times to granulocyte (greater than 500 x 10(6)/l) and platelet (greater than 50 x 10(9)/l) recovery at 58 and 148 days, respectively. The overall response rate was 56%. The median time to progression was 14 weeks. Thus, this regimen has activity against refractory malignancies although early and prohibitive toxicity occurs when mitoxantrone is escalated in this setting.
The niacin skin phenomenon reflects a prostaglandin (PG) mediated flush and oedema reaction. As PG metabolism is linked to breakdown of membrane lipids, diminished sensitivity to niacin application suggests potential disturbance in membrane phospholipid-arachidonic acid-PG pathways. We aimed to evaluate and quantify topical niacin skin reaction in early psychosis using optical reflection spectroscopy (ORS) and a new descriptive assessment scale integrating time course, redness, and oedema. Niacin skin tests were performed on 25 medicated first-episode psychosis patients fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for schizophreniform psychosis or schizophrenia and on 25 healthy controls. Nicotinic acid was applied in four dilution steps to the subjects inner forearm skin and skin reaction was consecutively assessed using ORS and a seven point rating scale. Both descriptive ratings and spectroscopic measures revealed significant group differences at the lower niacin concentrations (0.001 and 0.0001 M). At higher concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 M) only descriptive ratings were capable to show significant group effects. Data of both methods showed moderate to strong correlation (r=0.605) as long as the erythema was not affected by the oedema. The data suggest that niacin sensitivity is inversely correlated with negative symptoms. Both methods demonstrate that niacin sensitivity is impaired in a group of first episode psychosis patients and are therefore able to distinguish a subgroup of patients with metabolic impairment. Niacin sensitivity in high risk populations and the specificity of impaired skin response are subjects of further investigation.
Despite the beneficial effects of resveratrol (RSV) on cardiovascular disease and life span, its effects on type 2 diabetic nephropathy remain unknown. This study examined the renoprotective effects of RSV in db/db mice, a model of type 2 diabetes.
db/db mice were treated with RSV (0.3% mixed in chow) for 8 weeks. We measured urinary albumin excretion (UAE), histological changes (including mesangial expansion, fibronectin accumulation, and macrophage infiltration), oxidative stress markers (urinary excretion and mitochondrial content of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], nitrotyrosine expression), and manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) activity together with its tyrosine-nitrated modification and mitochondrial biogenesis in the kidney. Blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and plasma lipid profiles were also measured. The phosphorylation of 5'-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and expression of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) in the kidney were assessed by immunoblotting.
RSV significantly reduced UAE and attenuated renal pathological changes in db/db mice. Mitochondrial oxidative stress and biogenesis were enhanced in db/db mice; however, Mn-SOD activity was reduced through increased tyrosine-nitrated modification. RSV ameliorated such alterations and partially improved blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and abnormal lipid profile in db/db mice. Activation of AMPK was decreased in the kidney of db/db mice compared with db/m mice. RSV neither modified AMPK activation nor SIRT1 expression in the kidney.
RSV ameliorates renal injury and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis with Mn-SOD dysfunction in the kidney of db/db mice, through improvement of oxidative stress via normalization of Mn-SOD function and glucose-lipid metabolism. RSV has antioxidative activities via AMPK/SIRT1-independent pathway.
