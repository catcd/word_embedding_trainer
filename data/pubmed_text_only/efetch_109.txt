Endometriosis is a disease observed in women in fertile age, it causes pelvic pain characterized by dysmenorrea and dyspareunia. Moreover, there is an association with infertility. Between the alternative of the medical therapeutics of endometriosis drugs with hipogonadotrofic and hypoestrogenic effects, as the danazol and gestrinona has been used. At present, there are analogies of GnRH factor where leuprolide acetate allow a continue liberation in a monthly administration. This is a case of a woman with extensive endometriosis that has hepatitis due to danazol and subsequently was treated with leuprolide acetate. The effectiveness of leuprolide acetate is analyzed in relation with the relief of pain and the laparoscopic evaluation of the endometriosis focus.
Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is rare, especially in infants. We report here on an 8 month-old female infant who presented with tachycardia with a heart rate of 186 beats/ min. An electrocardiogram showed a right bundle branch block pattern, a QRS duration of 80 msec, a superior QRS axis, atrioventricular dissociation, and occasional fusion and capture beats. Suspected ventricular tachycardia was treated with lidocaine, propranolol and amiodarone, but in vain. The tachycardia was terminated and well controlled with the use of verapamil. According to an electrocardiogram and her clinical response, verapamil-sensitive idiopathic ventricular tachycardia was diagnosed with the arrhythmic origin in the left posterior fascicle.
This work was undertaken to assess the protective effect of an isoflavonoid, calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (CG), isolated from Astragali radix (AR) on the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA)-like lesion in a rabbit model.
Nine rabbits underwent an anterior cruciate ligament and menisectomy transection (ACLMT) of the rear knee joints to induce OA-like lesion. They were randomly divided into three groups (n=6/group): a negative control group treated with 200 microl of 0.5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a positive control group treated with 200 microl of 100 microM piroxicam, and a test group treated with 100 microg/500 microl of CG, where the test agents were administered by injection once a week for 4 weeks starting from the third week. Rabbits were then sacrificed to observe the progression of OA-like lesion. The synovial fluid was analyzed for the amounts of total proteins, glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). In addition, histopathologic analyses were performed on the OA-like articular cartilage with or without therapeutic treatments.
The total synovial fluid volume (P<0.05) was most strikingly reduced by the treatment with CG. Moreover, the CG treatment also significantly alleviated the OA-induced accumulation of prostaglandin (PG) (P<0.001) and total proteins (P<0.001) in the synovial fluid. The histopathologic analyses revealed that the CG treatment reduced the severity of the OA-like structural damages in the cartilage. However, the level of PGE(2), a pathologic inflammatory molecule, was not diminished by CG or piroxicam.
These results indicate that the isoflavonoid CG isolated from AR significantly alleviated the pathologic changes in the OA-like rabbit knee joints. This suggests that CG from AR could be a promising treatment for the therapy of OA.
There has been an increase in the number of patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin due to the better antiviral efficacy. The main serious adverse events of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin combination therapy are bone marrow suppression and hemolytic anemia. However, there are few reports of vasculitis occurring during PEG-IFN therapy. We describe a patient who developed vasculitis during the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with PEG-IFN and ribavirin.
Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy. Brain MR studies, including DW imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications. In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study, a follow-up MR study was performed 1 month later. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions. Of the 14 patients, 5 (35.7%) had white matter abnormalities, 1 (7.1%) had putaminal hemorrhage, and 8 (57.1%) had normal findings on initial MR images. Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities, 4 patients (80.0%) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images, and all showed complete resolution on follow-up images. The remaining 1 patient (20.0%) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity.
Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) resistance in patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B is not well understood. This study examined the initial virologic response (IVR) to ADV, the rate of ADV resistance and the factors associated with ADV resistance.
Eighty one lamivudine-resistant HBeAg-positive patients were enrolled in this study. IVR was defined as HBV DNA < 4 log10 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy.
IVR was observed in 37/81(45.7%) patients and it was associated with higher pretreatment ALT (P=0.002), and low pretreatment HBV DNA level (P=0.015). The HBV DNA levels were significantly higher in the non-IVR patients than the IVR patients at 12, 18 and 24 months (4.73 vs 2.59, 4.53 vs 2.31, 4.39 vs 2.40 log10 copies/mL, respectively; P<0.01). During the follow-up period, 17(21.0%) patients showed phenotypic resistance to ADV and 9 (11.1%) patients had ADV-resistant mutations. The cumulative probabilities of the phenotypic resistance to ADV at 12 and 24 months were 8.7% and 32.5%, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of the genotypic resistance to ADV at 12 and 24 months were 0% and 14.6%, respectively. Resistance to ADV was associated with a higher pretreatment HBV DNA (P=0.019), and non-IVR (P<0.001).
The cumulative probabilities of the phenotypic and genotypic resistance to ADV at 24 months were 32.5% and 14.6%. The high pretreatment HBV DNA and non-IVR (HBV DNA >/= 4 log10 copies/mL after 6 months of therapy) were associated with ADV resistance.
Diverse serine hydrolases including endocannabinoid metabolizing enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) have been suggested as secondary targets for organophosphate (OP) agents to exert adverse toxic effects such as lipid homeostasis disruption. The goal of this investigation is to verify that a major OP insecticide fenitrothion (FNT) induces plasma hypertriglyceridemia through the inhibition of FAAH and/or MAGL in comparison with that elicited by isopropyl dodecylfluorophosphonate (IDFP), a potent FAAH/MAGL inhibitor. Fasted mice were treated intraperitoneally with FNT or IDFP and were subsequently sacrificed for evaluations of plasma triglyceride (TG) levels and liver FAAH/MAGL activities. Plasma TG levels were significantly enhanced by the FNT or IDFP treatment (1.7- or 4.8-fold, respectively) compared with that of vehicle control. The IDFP exposure reduced the liver FAAH and MAGL activities, whereas the FNT exposure led to the preferential FAAH inhibition. The brain acetylcholinesterase was almost unaffected by the FNT or IDFP treatment, thus leading to no neurotoxic sign. Intriguingly, the TG elevations were averted by concomitant administration with the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251. The present findings suggest that OP agents induce plasma hypertriglyceridemia in mouse through single or dual inhibition of FAAH or/and MAGL, apparently leading to overstimulation of cannabinoid signal regulating energy metabolism.
Excessive daytime sleepiness due to any cause can result in various symptoms similar to those used for the diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A common treatment for children diagnosed with ADHD is methylphenidate which is also used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness. This paper reports on a study which compared the perceived levels of daytime sleepiness and prevalence of sleep disorders in medicated and un-medicated children with ADHD.
The sample consisted of two matched groups of children who had been formally diagnosed with ADHD. One group (n=12) was taking immediate release methylphenidate twice daily, while the other group (n=11) had never, and were not currently, taking any medication. The two groups, as well as their parents, rated their levels of daytime sleepiness at three points in a single day.
Significantly higher levels of daytime sleepiness were reported by the parents of the un-medicated children between the hours of 13:00 and 15:00, compared to the medicated children. The medicated children became increasingly sleepier from the first to the second measurement in both the morning and afternoon. There was no significant difference in the number of sleep disorders/disruptions reported by the parents of either group.
In a group of children with ADHD taking methylphenidate, there was a significant increase in sleepiness a few hours after taking the medication, which may then have a significant impact on their learning. The data also imply that part of the mechanism of action of methylphenidate effects in these children may be by reduction of daytime sleepiness.
A 79-year-old female patient with multiple myeloma who had no prior cardiac disease history developed an acute myocardial infarction on day 5 after receiving bortezomib and dexamethasone (BD). After treatment of coronary stenoses by stents, she received another course of BD therapy and developed angina pectoris on day 5 after the therapy. Bortezomib's antitumor effect is due to the inhibition of proteasome activity. This inhibition may increase endothelial progenitor cell apoptosis and decrease endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (eNOS/NO), thus leading to coronary spasm. It is, therefore, important to carefully monitor patients being treated with bortezomib for the potential occurrence of ischemic heart disease.
Microcystins (MCs), the products of blooming algae Microcystis, are waterborne environmental toxins that have been implicated in the development of liver cancer, necrosis, and even fatal intrahepatic bleeding. Alternative protective approaches in addition to complete removal of MCs in drinking water are urgently needed. In our previous work, we found that sulforaphane (SFN) protects against microcystin-LR (MC-LR)-induced cytotoxicity by activating the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated defensive response in human hepatoma (HepG2) and NIH 3T3 cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate and confirm efficacy the SFN-induced multi-mechanistic defense system against MC-induced hepatotoxicity in an animal model. We report that SFN protected against MC-LR-induced liver damage and animal death at a nontoxic and physiologically relevant dose in BALB/c mice. The protection by SFN included activities of anti-cytochrome P450 induction, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis. Our results suggest that SFN may protect mice against MC-induced hepatotoxicity. This raises the possibility of a similar protective effect in human populations, particularly in developing countries where freshwaters are polluted by blooming algae.
The interconnections among smoking status, severity of nicotine related physical dependence (NRPD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related physiological arousal and subjective health were explored within a sample of 66 resettled Bosnian refugees seeking primary healthcare services. Fifty-nine percent (n = 39/66) of the participants reported that they were current smokers and 44% (n = 29/66) indicated that they had smoked prior to the war. Both pre-war smoking and PTSD arousal independently predicted current smoking. In addition, total PTSD arousal and individual symptoms of sleep difficulties, irritability, concentration, and hypervigilance were significantly and positively associated with NRPD. Severity of PTSD arousal and age uniquely predicted NRPD. While poorer subjective health was significantly associated with positive current smoking status, neither poorer subjective health nor severity of PTSD arousal was significantly associated with interest in quitting/reducing smoking. Findings were discussed within the context of culture and stressor-related issues.
A 27-year-old man with typical mitral leaflet prolapse syndrome was under medical care for eight years with ventricular arrhythmias resistant to various antiarrhythmic drugs. He was started on digoxin, 0.25 mg daily, because of echocardiographically demonstrated left ventricular dilatation and functional impairment; he died of ventricular fibrillation 15 days later.
Steroid hormones may enter cells by diffusion through the plasma membrane. However, we demonstrate here that some steroid hormones are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis of steroid-carrier complexes. We show that 25-(OH) vitamin D3 in complex with its plasma carrier, the vitamin D-binding protein, is filtered through the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules by the endocytic receptor megalin. Endocytosis is required to preserve 25-(OH) vitamin D3 and to deliver to the cells the precursor for generation of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, a regulator of the calcium metabolism. Megalin-/- mice are unable to retrieve the steroid from the glomerular filtrate and develop vitamin D deficiency and bone disease.
It is known that the antineoplastic drug adriamycin (ADR) can cause cardiotoxic effects. Some data imply that pretreatment with selenium (Se) and the radio- and chemoprotector, amifostine (WR-2721), may confer a protective effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of single doses of Se and WR-2721, alone or in combination, in the prevention of acute ADR-induced cardiotoxicity in male Wistar rats. Se, in the form of sodium selenite (1.6 mg/kg i.p.), and WR-2721 (300 mg/kg i.p.) were given 24 hours and 20 minutes, respectively, before ADR (6 mg/kg i.v.). The cardiotoxicity of ADR was recorded 48 hours after its administration because earlier studies revealed that structural damage of the myocardium occurs within this period. Evaluation of these toxic effects, as well as of the cardioprotective efficacy of the administered drugs, was performed using (1) ECG-records before and during the infusion of the proarrhythmogenic compound, aconitine (8 microg/kg/min i.v.) and (2) the serum activity of creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase-(AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and its isoenzyme alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH). The results showed that the arrhythmogenic dose of aconitine was significantly reduced in ADR-treated rats (57.22 vs. 99.65 microg/kg in control; p < 0.05) and that this proarrhythmogenic compound caused a significant increase in heart rate in such animals compared to controls. Pretreatment with Se, WR-2721, and their combination partly reversed the arrhythmogenic dose of aconitine to control (72.09, 82.1, and 88.99 microg/kg, respectively). Se failed to prevent an aconitine-induced increase in heart rate, whereas WR-2721 and their combination successfully counteracted this effect. In addition, ADR produced a significant increase in the serum activity of all monitored enzymes. Pretreatment with Se failed to prevent this increase, whereas pretreatment with WR-2721 did. The best result was obtained with their combination. We conclude that the radio- and chemoprotector, WR-2721, particularly in combination with Se, may provide a significant protective effect against acute ADR-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.
The adenosine agonists 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA), 2-chloroadenosine (2-CLA), N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), 2-(phenylamino)adenosine (CV-1808) and R and S isomers of N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA and S-PIA) decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in mice and, except for CPA, did so at doses that did not impair motor coordination, a profile shared by dopamine antagonists. CV-1808, the only agent with higher affinity for A2 as compared with A1 adenosine receptors, displayed the largest separation between locomotor inhibitory and ataxic potency. Like dopamine antagonists, NECA and CV-1808 also decreased hyperactivity caused by d--amphetamine at doses that did not cause ataxia whereas A1-selective adenosine agonists reduced amphetamine's effects only at ataxic doses. Unlike dopamine antagonists, adenosine agonists inhibited apomorphine-induced cage climbing only at doses that caused ataxia. Involvement of central adenosine receptors in these effects was suggested by the significant correlation obtained between potency for locomotor inhibition after IP and ICV administration. Affinity for A1 but not A2 adenosine receptors was significantly correlated with potency for inducing ataxia. These results suggest that the behavioral profile of adenosine agonists in mice is related to their affinity for A1 and A2 adenosine receptors and indicate that adenosine agonists produce certain behavioral effects that are similar to those seen with dopamine antagonists.
Chlordecone (Kepone) is a close structural analog of mirex, but it differs considerably from mirex in toxic action. Chlordecone primarily produces neurotoxic symptoms such as tremors in humans and animals. As with other organochlorine pesticides, the mechanism of the toxic action of chlordecone is not completely understood. An attempt is made in this paper to review the effects of chlordecone on the membrane-bound adenosinetriphosphatases (ATPases) and related phenomena. Chlordecone is shown to be a potent inhibitor of ATPases in different tissue preparations of several species. The order of sensitivity of the ATPases tested to chlordecone was: oligomycin-sensitive (mitochondrial) Mg2+-ATPase greater than Na+,K+-ATPase greater than Ca2+-ATPase greater than oligomycin-insensitive Mg2+-ATPase. Compared to other tissues tested, brain Na+K+-ATPase and heart mitochondrial Mg2+-ATPase were more sensitive to chlordecone. Oligomycin-insensitive Mg2+-ATPase was the least affected enzyme. Membrane-bound Na+, K+-ATPase has been associated with catecholamine uptake processes, and inhibitors of this enzyme, such as ouabain, have been found to decrease catecholamine uptake. Chlordecone decreased the uptake of catecholamines by rat heart membranes in a dose-dependent manner. Various cellular processes such as catecholamine uptake are dependent for energy on ATP, and most of this ATP is produced in the mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation. Oligomycin-sensitive Mg2+-ATPase is involved in this coupling process. Chlordecone inhibition of this enzyme may result in depletion of mitochondrial ATP. This chain of events suggest that chlordecone interacts with membrane ATPases and thus may impair various energy-dependent cellular processes.
The change in the expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities in neoplastic colon and lung prompted us to study the possible effect of cancer on the expression of cholinesterases (ChEs) in kidney. Samples of papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), conventional RCC (cRCC), chromophobe RCC (chRCC) and renal oncocytoma (RON), beside adjacent non-cancerous tissues, were analyzed. In pRCC both AChE and BuChE activities were statistically increased; in cRCC and chRCC only AChE activity increased and in RON neither AChE nor BuChE activities were affected. Abundant amphiphilic AChE dimers (G(2)(A)) and fewer monomers (G(1)(A)) were identified in healthy kidney as well as in all tumour classes. Incubation with PIPLC revealed glycosylphosphatidylinositol in AChE forms. BuChE is distributed between principal G(4)(H), fewer G(1)(H), and much fewer G(4)(A) and G(1)(A) species. RT-PCR showed similar amounts of AChE-H, AChE-T and BuChE mRNAs in healthy kidney. Their levels increased in pRCC but not in the other tumour types. The data support the idea that, as in lung tumours, in renal carcinomas expression of ChE mRNAs, biosynthesis of molecular components and level of enzyme activity change according to the specific kind of cell from which tumours arise.
We have developed an in vitro model of chronic epilepsy in order to study the consequences of prolonged periods of epileptic activity. After applying the convulsants bicuculline and/or picrotoxin to mature rat hippocampal slice cultures for 3 days, large numbers of swollen and vacuolated cells were observed throughout all hippocampal subfields. The number of dendritic spines of pyramidal cells was massively reduced. These changes were similar to those observed previously in post-mortem studies of hippocampal tissue from human epilepsy patients. Intracellular recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells revealed that spontaneous synaptic activity was greatly reduced in treated cultures. gamma-Aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition was apparently not affected by sustained convulsant activity, although synaptic excitation was markedly depressed. Acute re-application of bicuculline to treated cultures elicited, upon stimulation of the mossy fibre tract, a typical interictal burst lasting several hundred milliseconds, with a wave form similar to those occurring in untreated cultures, but of a shorter duration. In contrast, ictal bursts (lasting tens of seconds), which always occur spontaneously in control cultures during initial perfusion of bicuculline, were not observed in treated cultures. These pathological changes were reversible when treated cultures were returned to normal medium for 1 week. The surviving cells had a healthy morphology and a normal complement of dendritic spines. Spontaneous synaptic activity was normal, and ictal bursts occurred spontaneously upon perfusion of bicuculline. The findings suggest that the morphological and functional changes are a consequence, rather than a direct cause of epilepsy.
The present study was undertaken to assess the influence of nitroprusside-induced hypotension on beta 2-adrenoceptor density. Twenty-four patients undergoing nose-septum corrections under general anesthesia were allocated randomly to a nitroprusside or control group. beta 2-Receptor density on lymphocytes was measured by binding studies using (-)125-iodocyanopindolol. Lymphocyte subpopulations B, T, Thelper, Tsuppressor, and natural killer cells were determined simultaneously by flow cytometry. Five of 12 nitroprusside-treated patients developed significant intraoperative increases of epinephrine levels (+69% versus preoperatively) which were not seen in the remaining seven patients. In these five patients, beta 2-receptor density of unfractionated lymphocytes was 26% lower (P < 0.05) on the first day after surgery compared with preoperative values. Since no changes in proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations were observed, these results are not caused by redistribution phenomena inducing a decrease of subsets with a high number of beta receptors. These findings suggest that beta 2-adrenergic responsiveness might be diminished after nitroprusside treatment in some patients.
Propofol is commonly used for sedation in a variety of clinical settings, as well as for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The ease with which propofol can be administered and titrated to clinical effect, in addition to its accepted safety profile, has made it the drug of choice for sedation in outpatient procedures, such as gastrointestinal endoscopy. While short-term amnesia is a well-known side-effect of propofol, we present the first documented case of prolonged retrograde amnesia following propofol administration in a pediatric patient. Possible mechanisms and clinical management strategies related to this unique event are discussed.
Rats injected with interleukin-1 (10 micrograms) and tumor necrosis factor (10 micrograms) and then exposed continuously to hyperoxia (greater than 99% O2, 1 atm) survived longer, had increased lung reduced/oxidized glutathione ratios, smaller pleural effusions, less pulmonary hypertension and improved arterial blood gases. The percentage of animals surviving for 72 hours in hyperoxia increased from 8% to 94%. Although relatively small increases in glutathione redox cycle enzymes occurred four and sixteen hours following cytokine injection, dramatic increases in all major antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase had occurred following 72 hours of exposure to hyperoxia. The protective effect of IL-1 + TNF against lethal pulmonary O2 toxicity could be partially inhibited by pre-injection of lysine acetylsalicylate or, less effectively, of ibuprofen. Recent studies have suggested that both IL-1 and TNF can induce manganese (mitochondrial) superoxide dismutase mRNA and protein synthesis in a variety of cell types. Preliminary studies suggest that IL-1 alone, in ample dosage, can provide protection against lethal pulmonary O2 toxicity. Future studies should be directed toward identification of acute phase changes in lung antioxidant enzymes, surfactant proteins and/or lipid components, enzymes needed for synthesis of surfactant phospholipids, and/or other protective proteins. Additional work also needs to be done in identifying the lung cell types in which early enzyme induction occurs. These studies should provide a better understanding of mechanisms whereby protection against pulmonary O2 toxicity can occur. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms inducing protective proteins should lead to more precise pharmacologic control of these processes.
Acute renal failure following intermittent or discontinuous rifampicin therapy is a relatively infrequent clinical observation. Many pathogenetic mechanisms for the renal failure have been proposed, including intravascular hemolysis with hemoglobinuria and its consequent nephrotoxicity. We report the case of a patient who used rifampicin in a discontinuous fashion and developed hemolysis with nonoliguric acute renal failure. Most reported cases of antirifampicin antibodies are of the IgM class; thus, the development of an IgG antirifampicin antibody is of interest, especially because of its strong in vivo hemolytic properties. In addition, this patient developed a nonoliguric uremic course that did not require dialysis, both of which are distinctly unusual for this clinical setting.
Estrogen receptor alpha-encoded by ESR1 gene-overexpression correlates with prognosis and response to specific chemotherapy in breast adenocarcinoma cases. Mechanisms of ESR-1 deregulation in carcinomas remain under investigation. To analyze ESR1 in carcinomas of different histogenesis. Using tissue microarray technology, 172 primary carcinomas including breast ductal adenocarcinomas (n=60), hepatocellular carcinomas (n=52), and colon adenocarcinomas (n=60) were cored and re-embedded in three paraffin blocks. Initial diagnosis was based on liquid based cytology (LiquiPrep/ThinPrep). Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed. Quantitative evaluation of ER-a protein levels was assessed by applying digital image analysis. ER-a overexpression was observed in 41/60 (68.3%), 23/52 (44.2%) and 4/60 (6.6%) cases, respectively. ESR1 gene multiple copies were confirmed in 13/60 (21.6%) breast adenocarcinomas, but high amplification only in 8/13 (62.8%). Allelic absence was identified in 3/52 (5.7%) hepatocellular carcinomas, whereas colon adenocarcinomas demonstrated gene gains in 5/60 (8.3%) cases referred to chr 6 aneuploidy and not to amplification. ER-a overall expression was associated strongly to ESR1 gene copies only in breast carcinoma (P=0.036). ESR-1 gene overexpression happens frequently in breast cancer, but only a subset of them are high amplified cases correlated to increased response rates in hormonal therapy (tamoxifen). Absence of this mechanism in hepatocellular and colon carcinomas maybe is a negative factor for applying this therapy. This is a pattern of histo-genetic depended targeted therapeutic strategy.
Our prior study showed that resveratrol could suppress infarct volume and exert neuroprotective effect on rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia (FCI) injury. Recently, it has been reported in some literature that resveratrol protects the spinal cord, kidney, and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury through upregulation of nitric oxide (NO). Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the role of nitric oxide on the neuroprotective mechanisms of resveratrol on rats after FCI injury.
The FCI injury was induced by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion for 1 hour and then a 24-hour reperfusion followed in the anesthetized Long-Evans rats. Resveratrol was intravenously injected after 1 hour MCA occlusion.
Treatment of resveratrol (0.1 and 1 microg/kg) decreased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma and malondialdehyde (MDA) in FCI injury brain tissue, whereas the level of NO in plasma was increased. In addition, resveratrol downregulated protein and mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and upregulated protein and mRNA expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), while the expression of protein and mRNA of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was unchanged. Pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, the nonselective NOS inhibitor) or L-N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO, the eNOS selective inhibitor) completely blocked the effect of resveratrol in decreasing infarction volumes.
This study demonstrated the important role of NO in the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol in FCI injury.
This report describes a patient who was normocalcemic prior to treatment with lithium for manic-depressive psychosis, and documents progressive hypercalcemia ensuing over the subsequent six years of therapy. Elevated parathyroid hormone levels were found and neck exploration revealed a parathyroid adenoma. Unlike the usual case of hyperparathyroidism, the hypercalcemia was associated with a very low urinary excretion of calcium. The literature is reviewed and possible pathogenetic mechanisms discussed. Serum calcium should be determined before and periodically during lithium therapy. In susceptible individuals, hypercalcemia may occur due to the unmasking or development of parathyroid adenoma.
