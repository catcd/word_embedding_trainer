Hepatic fibrosis represents a process of healing and scarring in response to chronic liver injury. alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a 13-amino-acid peptide with potent anti-inflammatory effects. We have previously demonstrated that alpha-MSH gene therapy protects against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute liver failure. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether alpha-MSH gene therapy possesses antihepatic fibrogenic effect. Liver fibrosis was induced by long-term TAA administration in mice. alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone expression plasmid was delivered via electroporation after liver fibrosis was established. Our results showed that alpha-MSH gene therapy attenuated liver fibrosis in TAA-treated mice. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that alpha-MSH gene therapy attenuated the liver transforming growth factor-beta1, collagen alpha1 and cell adhesion molecule mRNA upregulation. Following gene transfer, the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and cyclooxygenase-2 were both significantly attenuated. Further, alpha-MSH significantly increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), while tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMPs) were inactivated. In summary, alpha-MSH gene therapy reversed established liver fibrosis in mice and prevented the upregulated fibrogenic and pro-inflammatory gene responses after TAA administration. Its collagenolytic effect might be attributed to MMP and TIMP modulation. Hence, alpha-MSH gene therapy may be an effective therapeutic modality against liver fibrosis with potential clinical use.
Dendritic targeting of mRNA and local protein synthesis are mechanisms that enable neurons to deliver proteins to specific postsynaptic sites. Here, we demonstrate that epileptogenic stimuli induce a dramatic accumulation of BDNF mRNA and protein in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons in vivo. BDNF mRNA and protein accumulate in dendrites in all hippocampal subfields after pilocarpine seizures and in selected subfields after other epileptogenic stimuli (kainate and kindling). BDNF accumulates selectively in discrete dendritic laminas, suggesting targeting to synapses that are active during seizures. Dendritic targeting of BDNF mRNA occurs during the time when the cellular changes that underlie epilepsy are occurring and is not seen after intense stimuli that are non-epileptogenic, including electroconvulsive seizures and high-frequency stimulation. MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist that can prevent epileptogenesis but not acute seizures, prevents the dendritic accumulation of BDNF mRNA, indicating that dendritic targeting is mediated via NMDA receptor activation. Together, these results suggest that dendritic accumulation of BDNF mRNA and protein plays a critical role in the cellular changes leading to epilepsy.
Acenocoumarol has been proposed repeatedly as a safe alternative drug regimen for oral anticoagulation in patients who have suffered phenprocoumon-induced fulminant hepatic failure. The current report describes 2 patients with phenprocoumon-induced hepatic failure, necessitating liver transplantation in 1 case, who showed recurrence of liver damage when oral anticoagulation with acenocoumarol was attempted. Thus, acenocoumarol may not be a safe therapeutic alternative for patients who survived severe phenprocoumon-induced hepatotoxicity.
This study describes our experience with 12 patients with white clot syndrome encountered during a recent 36-month period. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria: (1) development of thrombocytopenia of less than 100,000/mm3 during administration of heparin therapy, (2) normalization of the platelet count after an interruption in heparin therapy, (3) exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia, (4) a positive heparin-induced platelet aggregation test, (5) detection of white clots on pathologic examination, and (6) the presence of thrombotic complications. Of 2,500 patients who received heparin therapy, 12 (0.48%) developed white clot syndrome. Various indications, routes of administration, and types of heparin were implicated. The mean platelet nadir was 26,900/mm3, and the mean time to onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was 5 days. Thrombotic complications included arterial occlusions of the legs in 11 patients, deep vein thrombosis of the legs in 9 patients (4 had pulmonary embolism), and combined arterial and venous thrombosis in 8 patients. Treatment strategies included discontinuation of heparin in all patients and intravenous infusion of dextran, followed by arterial thrombectomy in four patients, urokinase therapy in two patients for arterial complications, and insertion of Greenfield filters in six patients. All patients were given warfarin. The mortality rate was 25% and the morbidity rate was 50%. An initial platelet count should be obtained on all patients prior to receiving heparin, followed by repeat platelet counts every 2 to 3 days. Once thrombocytopenia or thrombosis is diagnosed, heparin should be discontinued and other methods of therapy considered.
Epidemiologic data suggest that Chinese women have a high incidence of lung cancer in relation to their smoking prevalence. In addition to active tobacco smoke exposure, other sources of fumes and airborne particles in the indoor environment, such as cooking and burning of incense and mosquito coils, have been considered potential risk factors for lung cancer.
We used a case-control study to explore effects of inhalants from combustion sources common in the domestic environment on lung cancer and their modification by active tobacco smoking.
We analyzed 703 primary lung cancer cases and 1,578 controls. Data on demographic background and relevant exposures were obtained by face-to-face interviews in the hospital.
We observed a positive relationship with daily exposure to incense or mosquito coils and to cooking fumes only among smokers, and no association among lifetime nonsmokers. Interactions between smoking and frequency of cooking, or exposure to incense or mosquito coils were statistically significant and consistent with synergistic effects on lung cancer. The odds ratio (OR) comparing smokers without daily incense or mosquito coil exposure with nonsmokers without daily exposure was 2.80 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.86-4.21], whereas the OR comparing smokers with daily exposure to the same referent group was 4.61 (95% CI, 3.41-6.24). In contrast, daily exposure to incense or mosquito coils was not associated with lung cancer among nonsmokers (OR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72-1.16). We observed the same pattern of associations for smokers without (OR = 2.31; 95% CI, 1.52-3.51) and with (OR = 4.50; 95% CI, 3.21-6.30) daily cooking exposure compared with nonsmokers, with no evidence of an association with daily cooking exposure among nonsmokers.
Our results suggest that active tobacco smoking not only is an important risk factor for development of lung cancer, but also may cause smokers to be more susceptible to the risk-enhancing effects of other inhalants.
S-1 has been considered to be a key drug in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer in Japan as a standard option of chemotherapy. Interindividual variation in the enzymes of the S-1 metabolic pathway can affect the extent of S-1 metabolism and impact the efficacy of S-1-based chemotherapy. In this review, the role of the "candidate" genetic factors affecting the therapeutic efficacy of S-1 is discussed with a special emphasis on polymorphism and gene expressions involved in the S-1 metabolic pathway, including CYP2A6, thymidylate synthase, thymidine phosphorylase, and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase. The predictive values of these candidates might be overcome with drugs combined with S-1. Pharmacogenetic studies based on a "global" approach by DNA microarray are promising to identify gastric cancer patients with both survival benefit and clinical benefit more accurately than those based on the "candidate" approach, especially for S-1 combination therapy. Large and controlled studies are needed to justify changes in the chemotherapeutic strategies, from "one-size fits all" to "tailor-made."
Heart failure is a major and escalating public health problem. Recent studies have demonstrated that statins prevented chronic heart failure (CHF) in animal studies. However, it is unknown whether statins therapy initiated after left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is evident can still effectively prevent CHF. This study tested the hypothesis that statins can prevent the transition of hypertrophy to heart failure.
The rats were studied at 6, 12, and 20 weeks after aortic stenosis (AS) operation. Some rats were given simvastatin (2.0 mg kg(-1) per day) from 13 weeks after AS operation for 8 weeks. Coarctation of aorta in rats resulted in compensatory LV hypertrophy (LVH), concomitant with an increase of superoxide levels and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in LV tissues at 12 weeks after AS operation. This was followed by CHF with a progressive increase in superoxide levels and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in LV tissues at 20 weeks after AS operation. Simvastatin treatment initiated from 13 weeks after AS operation significantly improved LV function and reduced superoxide levels and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in LV tissues. Pretreatment of simvastatin suppressed the hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of cultured cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats.
These data indicate that long-term administration of simvastatin improved LV function and prevented the transition of hypertrophy to CHF. Inhibition of oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis may contribute to the benefits of simvastatin treatment on heart of rats with AS.
Sequential modification of the previously identified 4-[3-aryl-2,2-dioxido-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-1(3H)-yl]-1-(methylamino)butan-2-ols led to the identification of a new series of 1-(2-morpholin-2-ylethyl)-3-aryl-1,3-dihydro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 2,2-dioxides that are potent and selective inhibitors of the norepinephrine transporter over both the serotonin and dopamine transporters. One representative compound 10b (WYE-114152) had low nanomolar hNET potency (IC(50) = 15 nM) and good selectivity for hNET over hSERT (>430-fold) and hDAT (>548-fold). 10b was additionally bioavailable following oral dosing and demonstrated efficacy in rat models of acute, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain.
Studies of the effects of air pollutants on birth weight often assess exposure with networks of permanent air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs), which have a poor spatial resolution.
We aimed to compare the exposure model based on the nearest AQMS and a temporally adjusted geostatistical (TAG) model with a finer spatial resolution, for use in pregnancy studies.
The AQMS and TAG exposure models were implemented in two areas surrounding medium-size cities in which 776 pregnant women were followed as part of the EDEN mother-child cohort. The exposure models were compared in terms of estimated nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels and of their association with birth weight.
The correlations between the two estimates of exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy were r = 0.67, 0.70, and 0.83 for women living within 5, 2, and 1 km of an AQMS, respectively. Exposure patterns displayed greater spatial than temporal variations. Exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy was most strongly associated with birth weight for women living < 2 km away from an AQMS: a 10-µg/m3 increase in NO2 exposure was associated with an adjusted difference in birth weight of -37 g [95% confidence interval (CI), -75 to 1 g] for the nearest-AQMS model and of -51 g (95% CI, -128 to 26 g) for the TAG model. The association was less strong (higher p-value) for women living within 5 or 1 km of an AQMS.
The two exposure models tended to give consistent results in terms of association with birth weight, despite the moderate concordance between exposure estimates.
The functions of crucial proteins in the nervous system are modulated by kinases and phosphatases which catalyze opposing reactions of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. During spinal cord central sensitization, serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) may play an important role in determining the excitability of nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord by modulating the phosphorylation state of some critical proteins. The effects of a general inhibitor of PP2A, okadaic acid (OA), and a specific inhibitor, fostriecin, on the behavioral responses of rats following capsaicin injection were investigated in this study. Hyperalgesia was initiated by injection of capsaicin into the plantar surface of the hindpaw of rats. An intrathecal catheter was previously implanted into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord for the administration of a variety of drugs. Rats were tested for responses to mechanical stimuli using von Frey filaments of different bending forces applied at a site outside the area of injection. Responses to heat stimuli were detected from a site near the injection area. The responses were recorded before and after injection of capsaicin with the perfusion of ACSF, OA negative control, OA or fostriecin at different time points. The results demonstrated that secondary mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia can be induced by the intradermal injection of capsaicin. Compared to administration of ACSF or the OA negative control, infusion of the phosphatase inhibitor OA or of fostriecin into the subarachnoid space enhanced the secondary mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia by making the intradermal capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia last longer.
It is well known that formaldehyde (FA) is cytotoxic and potentially carcinogenic. Although the individual effects of this reactant on cells has been investigated, the cytotoxicity exerted by the coexistence of FA is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of FA on the liver in rats, by light and electron microscopic level. We used 18 Wistar albino rats divided into three groups, exposed to 0 (control), 19.7 ppm FA gas for a total of 4 weeks, 8 h/day, 5 days a week (subacute) and 20.3 parts per million (ppm) FA gas for a total of 13 weeks, 8 h/day, 5 days a week (subchronic). After the completion of the exposure period, they were sacrificed by decapitation and their liver tissue samples were taken in order to be processed for light and electron microscopic studies. Light microscopic evaluation of liver tissue samples of FA-exposed rats revealed enlarged sinusoids filled with blood and mononuclear cell infiltration in the portal areas and around the central veins. In addition, some of the hepatocytes showed loss of cytoplasm, and some had a hyperchromatic nucleus. The cells of FA-exposed livers, on the other hand, showed an electron-lucent ground-cytoplasm and a hypertrophy of the smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. In conclusion, we observed that exposure FA caused diverse histopathological changes indicating the destruction in the liver tissue and this destruction has direct relationship with the length of the exposure period.
Lewy bodies in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) contain aggregates of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). Missense mutations (A53T or A30P) in the gene encoding alpha-syn are responsible for rare, inherited forms of PD. In this study, we explored the susceptibility of untransfected human dopaminergic BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells, cells transfected with vector only, or cells transfected with wild-type alpha-syn, A30P alpha-syn or A53T alpha-syn to Fe(II)-induced DNA damage in the form of single-strand breaks (SSBs). DNA SSBs were detected following 2-h treatments with various concentrations of Fe(II) (0.01-100.0 microm), using the alkaline single cell-gel electrophoresis ('Comet') assay and quantified by measuring comet tail length (CTL) microm). Fe(II) treatment induced significant increases in CTL in cells transfected with A30P alpha-syn or A53T alpha-syn, even at the lowest concentrations of Fe(II) tested. In comparison, untransfected cells, vector control cells or cells transfected with wild-type alpha-syn exhibited increases in SSBs only when exposed to concentrations of 1.0 microm Fe(II) and above. Even when exposed to higher concentrations (10.0-100.0 microm) of Fe(II), untransfected cells, vector control cells or cells transfected with wild-type alpha-syn were less susceptible to DNA-damage induction than cells transfected with A30P alpha-syn or A53T alpha-syn. Incorporation of DNA-repair inhibitors, hydroxyurea and cytosine arabinoside, enhanced the sensitivity of DNA damage detection. Susceptibility to Fe(II)-induced DNA damage appeared to be dependent on alpha-syn status because cells transfected with wild-type alpha-syn or A53T alpha-syn were equally susceptible to the damaging effects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor rotenone. Overall, our data are suggestive of an enhanced susceptibility to the toxic effects of Fe(II) in neuroblastoma cells transfected with mutant alpha-syn associated with inherited forms of PD.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is an important cause of hepatocellular injury. Non-nucleoside retroviral transcriptase inhibitors are known to cause hepatotoxicity. We describe a detailed case of fulminant hepatitis induced by nevirapine (Viramune) and treated by liver transplantation.
The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentration and platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin. Fifteen female migraineurs (without aura) and eight controls participated in the study. Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.5 mg) was administered. Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). In those subjects who had no migraine attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used. Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine. In addition, both change and peak, showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity (P<0.001). However, plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack. Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5-HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack. Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack. In conclusion, the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine. In contrast, serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine, it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model.
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are antimalarials used as first-line treatment of cutaneous lupus. Quinacrine is not often employed by Spanish physicians due to a lack of information about its use and the fact that it is not marketed in Spain. It is effective in monotherapy or in combination therapy with other antimalarials. One of the advantages of quinacrine over chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is that it does not appear to cause retinal toxicity. Quinacrine is used as second-line therapy in patients with pre-existing eye problems that contraindicate treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (after evaluation of which drug has the better risk-benefit relationship), and in combination therapy with other antimalarials inpatients with resistance or only a partial response to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We report 8 cases of patients with cutaneous lupus who received treatment with quinacrine in monotherapy or in combination with others antimalarials. Lesions resolved in 5 patients and improved in 3. Therapy had to be withdrawn in 1 patient due to an exacerbation of his psoriasis.
A patient with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome treated with haloperidol, ingested once daily after awakening from sleep, exhibited an irregular sleep-wake pattern with a free-running component of approximately 48 h. Transfer to risperidone, ingested once daily after awakening from sleep, was beneficial resulting in a sleep-wake cycle more synchronized at the appropriate phase to the external zeitgebers, and fewer nocturnal disturbances. The circadian sleep-wake schedule was fully synchronized when the patient had been subsequently treated with melatonin at 21:00h, before intended nocturnal sleep, in addition to risperidone in the morning. Restoration of the sleep-wake circadian pattern was accompanied by the patient's subjective report of significant improvement in his quality of life, social interactions, and occupational status. This observation suggests that circadian rhythm sleep disorders can be related to the typical neuroleptic haloperidol and restored by the atypical neuroleptic risperidone. Similar findings reported in patients suffering from other disorders support the hypothesis that the described disruption of the sleep-wake schedule is medication rather than illness-related. Therefore, it is very important to realize that circadian rhythm sleep disorders may be a side effect of neuroleptics.
A new American kindred with amyloidosis was found by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to have a mutation in the fibrinogen A alpha chain gene. Affected members in this kindred have autosomal dominant amyloid nephropathy. DNA sequencing showed a single nucleotide deletion at the third base of codon 524 of the fibrinogen A alpha chain genes (4904delG) that resulted in a frame shift and premature termination of the protein at codon 548. Antiserum was produced to a portion of the abnormal peptide predicted by the DNA sequence and amyloid deposits were immuno-histologically proven to contain this abnormal peptide. Two of the propositus' 4 children were positive for the mutant fibrinogen A alpha chain gene by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis based on polymerase chain reaction. These two mutant gene carriers now in the second decade of life show no clinical symptoms of amyloidosis as yet but have lower plasma fibrinogen concentrations when compared with their normal siblings. This the first description of a kindred with renal amyloidosis and low plasma fibrinogen and also the first report of amyloidosis caused by a frame shift mutation.
We have studied the mechanisms of auditory hair cell death after insults in vitro and in vivo. We show DNA fragmentation of hair cell nuclei after ototoxic drug and intense noise trauma. By using phospho-specific c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun antibodies in immunohistochemistry, we show that the JNK pathway, associated with stress, injury, and apoptosis, is activated in hair cells after trauma. CEP-1347, a derivative of the indolocarbazole K252a, is a small molecule that has been shown to attenuate neurodegeneration by blocking the activation of JNK (). Subcutaneously delivered CEP-1347 attenuated noise-induced hearing loss. The protective effect was demonstrated by functional tests, which showed less hearing threshold shift in CEP-1347-treated than in nontreated guinea pigs, and by morphometric methods showing less hair cell death in CEP-1347-treated cochleas. In organotypic cochlear cultures, CEP-1347 prevented neomycin-induced hair cell death. In addition to hair cells, CEP-1347 promoted survival of dissociated cochlear neurons. These results suggest that therapeutic intervention in the JNK signaling cascade, possibly by using CEP-1347, may offer opportunities to treat inner ear injuries.
Eighty children between 4 and 14 years of age suffering from bronchial asthma were investigated. Fifty-five of them showed clinical and radiological findings of sinusitis. Of these, 13 patients with purulent postnasal drip were treated with ampicillin, phenylephrine and triprolidine (therapy A) and for the other 42 ampicillin was replaced by beclomethasone (therapy B). Thirty-four of 55 children showed improvement in sinus X-rays; 20 children had a considerable decrease in the severity of asthma and many symptoms cleared up after the therapy for sinusitis (P less than 0.001). In conclusion, owing to the high prevalence of sinusitis in children with bronchial asthma, all asthmatic children should be investigated to check for a sinus disease.
Flavonoids have been identified as the antidiabetic components in a number of traditional ethnic remedies. However, the mechanisms whereby these compounds exert their hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic action in type-2 diabetes have rarely been investigated. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of the flavonoids hesperidin and naringin on glucose and lipid regulation in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Hesperidin and naringin both significantly increased the glucokinase mRNA level, while naringin also lowered the mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver. In addition, the hepatic glucose transporter 2 protein expression was significantly reduced, while the expression of adipocyte glucose transporter 4 and hepatic and adipocyte peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma were elevated in the hesperidin and naringin groups when compared with the control group. Furthermore, hesperidin and naringin effectively lowered the plasma free fatty acid and plasma and hepatic triglyceride levels, and simultaneously reduced the hepatic fatty acid oxidation and carnitine palmitoyl transferase activity. These changes were seemingly attributable to a suppression of the hepatic fatty acid synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activities and an increase in the fecal triglycerides. The two flavonoids also led to a decrease in the plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels that may have been partly due to the decreased hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase and acyl CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activities and increased fecal cholesterol. Consequently, the current results suggest that hesperidin and naringin are beneficial for improving hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in type-2 diabetic animals by partly regulating the fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and affecting the gene expression of glucose-regulating enzymes.
Three cases of leucoencephalopathy induced by carmofur (1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil), an antineoplastic derivative of 5-fluorouracil are reported and the literature is reviewed. Initial symptoms were unsteady gait and dementia developing several weeks or months after carmofur had been started. Symptoms increased gradually even after stopping the drug. Severe encephalopathy with confusion, delirium or coma appeared frequently. Symptoms were usually reversible but death occasionally occurred. The EEG showed marked slowing. Computed tomography of the brains of severely intoxicated patients showed marked hypodensity of the entire cerebral white matter. Carmofur must be discontinued immediately if any psychomotor symptoms develop.
Since amphotericin B nephrotoxicity is mediated, in part by hypoxic tubular injury, the role of endothelin in the renal vasoconstriction, characteristic of amphotericin toxicity has been studied. Intact and salt depleted rats were infused with amphotericin B (20 micrograms/kg per min) or 5% dextrose over 20 min. Plasma endothelin levels determined at the conclusion of the infusion period, did not differ between the experimental groups, despite a marked reduction in renal blood flow noted in rats infused with amphotericin B. Amphotericin B (10(-5)-10(-7) M) did not stimulate endothelin release from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. However, in a model of chronic amphotericin nephrotoxicity produced by repeated daily intraperitoneal injections of amphotericin B (5 mg/kg) to salt depleted rats, renal failure was associated with elevated plasma endothelin levels (29.3 +/- 4.4 fmol/mL, vs 10.8 +/- 1.2 fmol/mL in salt depleted controls, P less than 0.01). We conclude that while plasma endothelin may be increased in chronic amphotericin B nephropathy, this peptide does not mediate the acute renal vasoconstriction associated with the infusion of this drug.
Aristolochic Acid (AA) is a component of Chinese herbs that has been found to be toxic to multiple organs in adults. Its toxicity to developing embryos has not been reported. Here, we describe that AA specifically causes heart defects in developing zebrafish embryos in a dosage-dependent manner. The treated embryos are able to develop their hearts normally up to 24 h postfertilization, when cardiac contraction initiates, but begin to show deformation and reduction of the hearts followed by gradual contractility loss and eventually lethality, suggesting that AA is primarily affecting cardiac physiology rather than cardiogenesis. Histological analyses reveal that the AA-treated hearts develop hypertrophy and disorganization of cardiomyocytes and loss of endocardium. By transmission electron microscopy, we observed broken and disorganized cardiac fibers in the AA-treated hearts. AA induces the expression of proinflammation genes, including cox-2, IL-1beta, and others. The AA-induced cardiac defects can be attenuated by the cox-2 antagonist NS398 via reducing the expression of the inflammatory genes. This attenuation could be further enhanced by known heart failure drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. In contrast, the heart defects are enhanced by a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. In summary, AA causes profound toxicity to zebrafish embryos that exhibit pathophysiological and pharmacological features resembling those of heart failure in humans and other model organisms, and thus, zebrafish could be a new model for studies on heart failure.
The recovery of the rat diaphragm from neuromuscular blockade was studied in order to separate the contributions of drug binding and tissue washout. The in vitro rat diaphragm preparation was perfused with a cholinesterase-free solution via the phrenic vein and stimulated electrically via the phrenic nerve. Muscle paralysis was induced by infusion of a depolarizing blocker succinylcholine or by the nondepolarizing blocker pancuronium. The time for recovery from 25-75% recovery averaged 1.0 +/- 0.1 min for pancuronium and 0.8 +/- 0.1 min for succinylcholine at the fast (1.9 ml/min) perfusion rate. This was prolonged to 2.0 +/- 0.3 min for pancuronium and 1.4 +/- 0.1 min for succinylcholine at the slower (0.76 ml/min) rate. More sensitive paired tests of recovery utilizing recovery time and rate demonstrated no drug difference in three comparisons and a 44% longer recovery time for pancuronium only at the lower perfusion rate. In general, recovery times were similar for both drugs. The rapid recovery from pancuronium blockade in this mammalian system as perfusion rate was increased suggests that recovery from this drug is not impaired by drug binding but is strongly dependent on organ perfusion.
