Atypical neuroleptics produce fewer extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) than typical neuroleptics. The pharmacological profile of atypical neuroleptics is that they have equivalent or higher antagonist affinity for 5-HT2 than for dopamine D2 receptors. Our aim was to identify which 5-HT2 receptor contributed to the atypical profile. Catalepsy was defined as rats remaining immobile over a horizontal metal bar for at least 30 s, 90 min after dosing. Radioligand binding assays were carried out with homogenates of human recombinant 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors expressed in Human Embryo Kidney (HEK293) cells. Haloperidol (1.13 mg kg(-1) i.p.) induced catalepsy in all experiments. The selective 5-HT2C/2B receptor antagonist, SB-228357 (0.32-10 mg kg(-1) p.o.) significantly reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy whereas the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor antagonists, MDL-100907 (0.003-0.1 mg kg(-1) p.o.) and SB-215505 (0.1-3.2 mg kg(-1) p.o.) respectively did not reverse haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The data suggest a role for 5-HT2C receptors in the anticataleptic action of SB-228357.
To assess the involvement of the TSLC cascade in hepatocarcinogenesis, we investigated the expression and DNA methylation patterns of the genes Tslc1 and Dal-1 in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) induced using N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) in rats. Six-week-old male F344 rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of DEN at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight, followed by combined treatment with partial hepatectomy and colchicine to induce cell-cycle disturbance and a selection procedure consisting of 2-acetylaminofluorene and carbon tetrachloride. Total RNA was extracted from 10 HCC, and the expression levels of Tslc1 and Dal-1 were measured using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Three of 10 HCC showed reduced expression of Tslc1, compared with normal liver tissues, but no changes in the expression level of Dal-1 were found. For DNA methylation analysis, bisulfite sequencing was performed. The 5' upstream region of Tslc1 was methylated in the three HCC in which its expression was reduced, but was unmethylated in normal liver tissue. Western blot analysis also revealed reduced expression of Tslc1 protein in the three HCC. These results suggest that alterations to the TSLC cascade might have a role in hepatocarcinogenesis using DEN in rats.
Nalbuphine, a mixed agonist-antagonist opiate, is commonly used as a systemic analgesic during labour. Recent reports of perinatal adverse effects prompted us to carry out therapeutic nalbuphine monitoring in obstetric analgesia. Because data on fetomaternal transfer are scarce and the pharmacokinetics of this drug in the neonate are largely unknown, we report data obtained from 28 parturients treated with nalbuphine either intramuscularly and/or intravenously during labour. Plasma nalbuphine levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. At delivery, 30-150 min after maternal administration, nalbuphine concentrations ranged from 5.0 to 79.2 ng.ml-1 in mother plasma samples and from 3.0 to 46.6 ng.ml-1 in umbilical cord plasma samples. Nalbuphine concentrations were highly correlated to dose. The fetomaternal ratio was high: 0.74 and not correlated to the administered dose of nalbuphine. An estimated plasma half-life of 4.1 h was calculated from two determinations in the neonate based on the assumption of a monoexponential decay of nalbuphine concentrations. Apart from a flattening of the fetal heart rate tracing in 54% of the cases, only one neonate had a low Apgar score at birth. The apparent prolonged half-life of nalbuphine in the neonate indicates the usefulness of an intramuscular injection of naloxone to prevent recurrence of cardiorespiratory depression due to nalbuphine administration to the mother.
"Atypical anti-psychotics" are substances of choice in treating drug-induced psychosis (DP) in Parkinson's disease (PD). We report on four patients with DP who received treatment with ziprasidone after previously applied clozapine and quetiapine had failed. Three patients showed a significant improvement of DP, without deterioration of motor function. In one case, ziprasidone considerably increased decline in off-periods. Two patients developed pathological laughing as a possible side-effect of ziprasidone. Ziprasidone may serve as an additional "atypical anti-psychotic" for the treatment of DP in PD but can also induce deterioration of motor function.
The long-term efficacy of clozapine therapy and its effect on health care costs were examined over a two-year period. Patients on clozapine showed marked clinical improvement as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. They also had significantly lower rates of rehospitalization and hospitalization costs than a comparison group of schizophrenic patients who received standard neuroleptic treatment and who were considerably less psychotic at hospital admission. By the second year of the study, savings on mental health care costs averaged $20,000 for each patient on clozapine therapy. The savings were due largely to the patients' change in residence from costly inpatient facilities to less expensive settings in the community.
A total of 64 courses of ifosfamide (IFM) treatments for sarcoma patients were evaluated for toxic effects. A dose of 100 ml of 1/2 diluted Maalox by normal saline was instilled into urinary bladder with clump of catheter for 15 min for uroprotection instead of Mesna that was not available in Japan at that time. Forty-six courses of ifosfamide treatment in 12-16 g/m2 doses with daily Maalox instillation resulted only one hemorrhagic cystitis, while 18 courses at a dose of 6-10 g/m2 of IFM without Maalox eventuated in 5 cases of hemorrhagic cystitis. Forty-six courses of ifosfamide treatment at a dose of 12-16 g/m2 (mean dose of 14.4 g/m2) for 5 to 6 day continuous infusion were evaluated also for myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and other toxicities. Myelosuppression was acceptable, although the absolute neutrophil count of the 80% course was below 500. No patient showed neurotoxicity characterized by confusion or somnolence. No course resulted in abnormal serum creatinine elevation, although two of 46 courses caused an abnormal decrease of creatinine clearance. One patient had arrhythmia that required medical treatment after 5 courses of IFM treatment.
To enlighten the early response of endometrium to tamoxifen by assessing the expression of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, Ki-67, and the histological response in endometria from normal postmenopausal women treated for 21 days with tamoxifen.
A total of 40 women, scheduled to undergo vaginal hysterectomy because of uterine prolapse, were randomly assigned to the tamoxifen group (20 mg/day; 20 women) or the control group (20 women). Samples were obtained from the upper and the lower thirds of the uterine cavity. Standard immunohistochemical staining of estrogen and progesterone receptors and of Ki-67 was performed on frozen sections. Staining was assessed using semiquantitative immunoreactivity scores.
Simple endometrial hyperplasia was diagnosed in 18 of the 20 samples exposed to tamoxifen compared with only 2 of the 20 controls ( P< 0.0005). Staining was increased in both the epithelium and stroma in the tamoxifen samples, a difference that was significant for estrogen receptors in glandular epithelium (180 +/- 80 v 110 +/- 110; P< 0.05). Also, Ki-67 antigen was expressed more frequently in both glandular epithelium ( P< 0.05) and stroma ( P< 0.05) in the tamoxifen samples.
Tamoxifen rapidly up-regulated the cell proliferation markers, an effect that was associated with enhanced growth as confirmed by increased expression of estrogen receptors and Ki-67, in addition to a high incidence of glandular hyperplasia.
The MEPE (matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein) gene is a strong candidate for the tumor-derived phosphaturic factor in oncogenic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (OHO). X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is phenotypically similar to OHO and results from mutations in PHEX, a putative metallopeptidase believed to process a factor(s) regulating bone mineralization and renal phosphate reabsorption. Here we report the isolation of the murine homologue of MEPE, from a bone cDNA library, that encodes a protein of 433 amino acids, 92 amino acids shorter than human MEPE. Mepe, like Phex, is expressed by fully differentiated osteoblasts and down-regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3. In contrast to Phex, Mepe expression is markedly increased during osteoblast-mediated matrix mineralization. Greater than normal Mepe mRNA levels were observed in bone and osteoblasts derived from Hyp mice, the murine homologue of human XLH. Our data provide the first evidence that MEPE/Mepe is expressed by osteoblasts in association with mineralization.
Systemic administration of corticosteroids was attempted in the treatment of olfactory loss resistant to topical corticosteroid treatment in patients with nasal and paranasal disease and post-upper respiratory infection. Significant efficacy was achieved with a short course of high-dose oral corticosteroids in patients with non-allergic sinus disease. On the other hand, anosmia induced by upper respiratory infection failed to respond to systemic corticosteroid treatment, suggesting permanent damage to the olfactory receptor cell. The underlying mechanism of effectiveness observed in patients with sinus disease may be explained by improvement of the mucosal thickening of the olfactory fissure, leading to the access of an odorant to the olfactory neuroepithelium.
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of i.v. ketorolac and fentanyl for moderate to severe postoperative pain in patients undergoing elective surgery in an ambulatory surgery unit.
A double-blind randomized trial.
An ambulatory surgery unit in a university-affiliated hospital.
Sixty-nine patients undergoing elective laparoscopy, inguinal hernia repair, or knee arthroscopy were enrolled.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketorolac 30 mg (n = 38) or fentanyl 50 micrograms (n = 31) for moderate to severe postoperative pain.
Pain, assessed using a 100-mm visual analog scale and a 5-point verbal pain scale; adverse effects, as well as vital signs were recorded every 15 min for 150 min or until discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, 6 and 24 h after discharge.
Pain reduction on both visual analog and verbal scales was significantly greater with fentanyl than ketorolac at 15 min. In addition, the proportion of patients requiring remedication at the 15-min time point was significantly greater in the ketorolac group. However, there were no significant differences between fentanyl and ketorolac between 30 and 150 min after surgery. Notably, pain reduction was significantly greater with ketorolac on the verbal scale at the 6 h measurement.
Ketorolac appears not be as effective as fentanyl in treating early postoperative pain. Although fentanyl still appears to be the drug of choice in the early postoperative period, the parenteral use of ketorolac was more effective during the later postoperative period in providing longer lasting analgesia.
Although rare, ototoxicity from the use of aminoglycoside drops is well recognized. Ototoxicity has not been described with the use of combination aminoglycoside-steroid-antifungal creams or ointments. We present the case of a 60-year-old man with a perforated tympanic membrane who suffered a total hearing loss after the instillation of cream containing triamcinolone, neomycin, gramicidin and nystatin (Tri-Adcortyl cream) into his ear canal. On balance, we believe that a number of potentially ototoxic constituents in this cream were responsible. Other possible causes of sensorineural hearing loss and the possible mechanisms of ototoxicity of this cream are discussed. The reasons why such creams may be particularly ototoxic, compared with drops, are also considered. The authors caution against the use of such creams or ointments in the ear if there is any suspicion of a tympanic membrane perforation.
The effects of oral methadone on EEG and sleep were studied in 6 male postaddicts. Continuous nocturnal measurement of EEG, EMG and EOG was used to define sleep patterns. Period analysis and power spectral analysis were performed on each 8 min sample of daytime (eyes closed) EEG. Both sleep and EEG were studied during a predrug control period, during the methadone induction phase (45-60 mg/day), stabilization phase (100 mg/day), and then 6; 10, 13, 18 and 22 weeks after withdrawal. One subject did not complete the last two withdrawal sessions. While on methadone, subjects reported that they slept more and also showed an increase in slow wave activity and a decrease in fast wave activity of their EEG during this time. Nocturnal sleep was not markedly altered during the chronic administration of methadone. Subjects reported an increase in dreaming soon after withdrawal, and then 3-5 weeks of nocturnal isnomnia. At the 6th week after withdrawal, slow wave activity in the daytime EEG was decreased, fast wave activity was increased, and mean EEG frequency was increased. REM sleep and delta sleep were increased during withdrawal. These data provide further evidence that chronic administration of narcotic analgesics may induce persistent functional changes in the central nervous system.
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelin A receptor (ETAR) contribute to the development and progression of breast carcinomas by modulating cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and anti-apoptosis. We investigated antitumoral effects of the specific ETAR antagonist ZD4054 in breast cancer cells and xenografts, and assessed antitumoral efficacy of the combinations of ZD4054 with aromatase inhibitors and fulvestrant. Gene expression changes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Cell proliferation was measured using alamarBlue; migration and invasion assays were performed using modified Boyden chambers. Evaluating the antitumoral efficacy of ZD4054 in vivo, different breast cancer models were employed using nude mice xenografts. ZD4054 reduced ET-1 and ETAR expression in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. ZD4054 inhibited invasion by up to 37.1% (P = 0.022). Combinations of ZD4054 with either anastrozole or letrozole produced significant reductions in migration of aromatase-overexpressing MCF-7aro cells (P < 0.05). Combination of ZD4054 with fulvestrant reduced MCF-7 cell migration and invasion by 36.0% (P = 0.027) and 56.7% (P < 0.001), respectively, with effects significantly exceeding those seen with either compound alone. Regarding tumor volume reduction in vivo, ZD4054 (10 mg/kg) was equipotent to fulvestrant (200 mg/kg) and exhibited additive effects with anastrozole (0.5 mg/kg). These data are the first indicating that selective ETAR antagonism by ZD4054 displays antitumoral activity on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our data strongly support a rationale for the clinical use of ZD4054 in combination with endocrine therapies.
We analyzed two polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins of the dopamine system, the Val158Met polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene and the 120-bp VNTR polymorphism in the promoter of the dopamine D4 receptor gene for association with methamphetamine abuse. We used a case/control design with 416 methamphetamine abusing subjects and 435 normal controls. All subjects were Han Chinese from Taiwan. We found an excess of the high activity Val158 allele in the methamphetamine abuser group, consistent with several previous reports of association of this allele with drug abuse. The 120-bp VNTR polymorphism in the promoter of the dopamine D4 receptor gene itself did not show significant association with methamphetamine abuse. However, analysis of the 120-bp VNTR polymorphism and the exon 3 VNTR in the dopamine D4 receptor as a haplotype showed significant association with methamphetamine abuse, which gave an empirical P value 0.0034 for a heterogeneity model. Moreover, there were significant interactive effects between polymorphisms in the catechol-O-methyltransferase and dopamine D4 genes. The evidence of interaction between COMT 158 Val/Met and DRD4 48-bp VNTR polymorphisms (P = 0.0003, OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.148-1.77), and between COMT 158 Val/Met and DRD4 120 bp promoter polymorphisms (P = 0.01, OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.10-1.18) were significant but the latter was weak. We conclude that genetic variation in the dopamine system may encode an additive effect on risk of becoming a methamphetamine abuser.
The potential toxicologic effects to dogs of 1,3-dichloropropene (1, 3-D), a soil fumigant used for the control of nematodes, were investigated. The 13-week subchronic toxicity study consisted of male and female beagle dogs (4/sex/dose group) given approximately 0, 5, 15, or 41 mg 1,3-D/kg body wt/day (approximately equivalent amounts of cis and trans isomers) via their diets. The 1-year chronic toxicity study consisted of male and female beagle dogs (4/sex/dose group) provided diets delivering approximately 0, 0.5, 2. 5, or 15 mg/kg body wt/day. The test material was stabilized in the feed by microencapsulation in a starch/sucrose matrix (80/20). In both the 13-week and the 1-year studies, the primary effect of 1,3-D in male and female dogs ingesting a dosage of >/=15 mg/kg/day was hypochromic, microcytic anemia. The anemia was regenerative, with increased erythropoietic activity characterized by polychromasia of erythrocytes and increased numbers of reticulocytes in peripheral blood. In the 13-week study, the anemia in dogs given 41 mg/kg/day progressively worsened over time, while the anemia in dogs given 15 mg/kg/day remained relatively constant between 42 and 90 days of dosing. Partial reversal of the anemia of high-dose animals occurred during a 5-week recovery period following the 13-week dosing regimen. In the 13-week study, terminal fasted body weights of males given 15 or 41 mg/kg/day were decreased 3 and 28%, respectively, and body weights of females given 5, 15, or 41 mg/kg/day were decreased 4.5, 12, and 24%, respectively, relative to controls. Males given 5 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks had no change in body weights relative to controls. In the 1-year study, the hypochromic microcytic anemia in dogs given 15 mg/kg/day remained relatively constant in severity between 3 and 12 months of treatment. Histopathologic alterations associated with anemia in the 1-year study consisted of increased hematopoiesis of the bone marrow and increased extramedullary hematopoiesis of the spleen. Body weights of males given 15 mg/kg/day were 5-12% lower than controls during the first 13 weeks of the study and 13-19% lower than controls during the remaining 9 months. Body weights of females given 15 mg/kg/day were 5-14% lower than controls over the majority of the dosing period. Males and females given 0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg/day for 1 year had no change in body weights relative to controls. A no-observed-effect level of 2.5 mg/kg/day was established for male and female dogs from the 1-year study.
Mutations in the human sonic hedgehog gene (SHH) are the most frequent cause of autosomal dominant inherited holoprosencephaly (HPE), a complex brain malformation resulting from incomplete cleavage of the developing forebrain into two separate hemispheres and ventricles. Here we report the clinical and molecular findings in five unrelated patients with HPE and their relatives with an identified SHH mutation. Three new and one previously reported SHH mutations were identified, a fifth proband was found to carry a reciprocal subtelomeric rearrangement involving the SHH locus in 7q36. An extremely wide intrafamilial phenotypic variability was observed, ranging from the classical phenotype with alobar HPE accompanied by typical severe craniofacial abnormalities to very mild clinical signs of choanal stenosis or solitary median maxillary central incisor (SMMCI) only. Two families were initially ascertained because of microcephaly in combination with developmental delay and/or mental retardation and SMMCI, the latter being a frequent finding in patients with an identified SHH mutation. In other affected family members a delay in speech acquisition and learning disabilities were the leading clinical signs.
mutational analysis of the sonic hedgehog gene should not only be considered in patients presenting with the classical holoprosencephaly phenotype but also in those with two or more clinical signs of the wide phenotypic spectrum of associated abnormalities, especially in combination with a positive family history.
We conducted a prospective clinical trial to assess the relative efficacy and safety of high- vs. low-dose D-penicillamine in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Following clinical tests and liver biopsy diagnostic of primary biliary cirrhosis, 56 patients were randomized to receive either 250 or 750 mg D-penicillamine daily. Patients were monitored with clinical tests and annual liver biopsy. Randomization produced two groups without differences in demographic, clinical or histologic characteristics. During the trial, no differences were seen between the mean change in liver test results in patients in either treatment group. The 11% per year rise of bilirubin in the 750 mg dose group during the first 3 years was not significantly different from the 18% per year rise in the 250 mg dose group. No patient showed improvement on liver biopsy although patients on 750 mg D-penicillamine deteriorated more slowly. Side effects, particularly rash and dysgeusia, were more common in the 750 mg dose group. The frequency and severity of side effects were responsible for the early conclusion of our trial. Twenty-six patients experienced side effects necessitating discontinuation of D-penicillamine. No evidence of increased efficacy was demonstrated by high-dose D-penicillamine therapy, and side effects were observed in patients on 250 mg D-penicillamine daily. With the severity of adverse effects and continued progression of disease, D-penicillamine is not a clinically useful therapy in primary biliary cirrhosis.
To investigate the effect of selective nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappa-B) inhibitors, pyrolidium dithiocarbamate (PD) and sulfasalazine (SZ) on renal tubular necrosis and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NFkappa-B expression induced by gentamicin in rats.
In all, 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six equal groups; group 1, control; group 2, injected with gentamicin for 10 days (100 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal, i.p.); group 3, injected with gentamicin plus PD (100 mg/kg/day, i.p.); group 4, injected with gentamicin plus SZ (75 mg/kg/day, i.p.); group 5, injected with gentamicin plus distilled water (vehicle for PD); and group 6, injected with gentamicin plus ammonium hydroxide (75 mg/day, 1 m, vehicle for SZ) for 10 days. At 24 h after the last injection, rats were killed and the renal cortex separated from the medulla. A small sample was fixed in formaldehyde solution for histological and immunohistochemical examination. Blood samples were also taken to assess the serum levels of urea, creatinine, Na(+), K(+) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GT). Crude extracts of the cortex were used to determine reduced glutathione (GSH-Px), NO and malondialdehyde (MDA). Immunohistochemically, iNOS and the active subunit of NFkappaB, P65, were evaluated using mouse monoclonal antibodies.
On haematoxylin and eosin staining, compared with the controls rats, gentamicin caused widespread tubular necrosis (grade 3 and 4) but in group 3 and 4 there was a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. Immunohistochemically there was more marked staining for iNOS and P65 expression in rats given gentamicin than in the control and group 3 and 4 (P < 0.001). In groups 3 and 4 iNOS and P65 expression were significantly less than in rats given only gentamicin. There was no significant difference in serum levels of Na(+), K(+), blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Compared with control rats, gentamicin caused hyperproteinuria, a marked increase in levels of serum gamma-GT, MDA and NO, and a decrease in GSH-Px (P < 0.001).
These results indicate that gentamicin induces iNOS expression through activation of NFkappa-B (P65). It is possible to prevent gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity using selective NFkappa-B inhibitors.
Laminaria japonica Areshoung, a widely consumed marine vegetable, has traditionally been used in Korean maternal health. The present study investigated the antiobesity effects of Laminaria japonica Areshoung ethanol extract (LE) and its molecular mechanism in high-fat-diet-induced obese rats. Six-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats were separately fed a normal diet or a high-calorie high-fat diet for 6 weeks; then they were treated with LE or tea catechin for another 6 weeks. LE administration significantly decreased the body weight gain, fat-pad weights, and serum and hepatic lipid levels in HD-induced obese rats. The histological analysis revealed that LE-treated group showed a significantly decreased number of lipid droplets and size of adipocytes compared to the HD group. To elucidate the mechanism of action of LE, the levels of genes and proteins involved in obesity were measured in the liver and skeletal muscle. LE treatment resulted in an increased expression of fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis-related genes in obese rats. Conversely, the expression of the fat intake-related gene (ACC2) and lipogenesis-related genes was reduced by LE treatment. Additionally, LE treatment increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and its direct downstream protein, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, which is one of the rate-limiting enzymes in fatty acid synthesis pathway. These findings demonstrate that LE treatment has a protective effect against a high-fat-diet-induced obesity in rats through regulation of expression of genes and proteins involved in lipolysis and lipogenesis.
We report an unusual and emerging cause of profound hypokalaemia associated with a severe myopathy, attributable to misuse of Nurofen Plus, a readily available over-the-counter medication containing ibuprofen and codeine, and excessive ingestion of the caffeine-containing energy drink, Red Bull. The mechanism of the hypokalaemia may be ascribed to ibuprofen-mediated type 2 renal tubular acidosis, and caffeine-mediated antagonism of adenosine receptors or intercompartmental shift of potassium into the intracellular space. Practitioners should be aware that patients with codeine addiction who misuse Nurofen Plus may present with severe hypokalaemia complicated by myopathy.
Inverted tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a variation of stress cardiomyopathy. It features transient myocardial dysfunction characterised by a typical contractile abnormality consisting of extensive left ventricular circumferential dyskinesia or akinesia with a hyperkinetic apex. Endogenous catecholamine surges are believed to be the mediators of this potentially life-threatening condition. We describe a patient who received an inadvertent bolus of noradrenaline and developed significant haemodynamic instability associated with electrocardiographic and cardiac biomarkers indicative of diffuse myocardial injury and echocardiography findings of an "inverted" TTC. The patient made a full recovery. Our case highlights that a reversible inverted TTC may result from an exogenous catecholamine surge.
Incessant VTs in infancy are often poorly tolerated. Response to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy is disappointing. The present case involves a 3-week-old infant with an incessant VT of a left bundle branch block, and normal axis morphology. This tachycardia was inducible with both atrial and ventricular pacing, but not by premature stimulation. Tachycardia persisted despite treatment with adenosine, esmolol, procainamide, and flecainide. Intravenous verapamil suppressed tachycardia and prevented inducibility, and no further recurrences were seen on oral verapamil. This case suggests that some incessant VTs in infancy may be due to calcium channel related afterdepolarizations or triggered activation.
Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) results from a decrease in the activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. In the sporadic form, the decrease in the activity is restricted to the liver and is generally related to alcohol, estrogens, iron overload, hepatitis C infection, and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. We describe the development of porphyria cutanea tarda in a 53-year-old woman one year after breast cancer surgery and the initiation of treatment with tamoxifen. No additional drugs were prescribed. After tamoxifen was discontinued, a gradual clinical and laboratorial improvement was noticed suggesting a causative role of the drug. There are many reports discussing tamoxifen side-effects, but there are only three case reports in the literature that describe tamoxifen as a probable trigger of porphyria cutanea tarda. In this report, the potential porphyrinogenicity of tamoxifen and clinical implications are the targets of our discussion.
Effect of ketamine on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery. Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action. This depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase. Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery.
Artificial hypotension induced by 0.01% nitroglycerin solution was applied in 60 operations on the brain. It contributed to the creation of optimum conditions for radical removal of tumors and exclusion of vascular aneurysms, reduction of blood loss, and a decrease in the number of blood transfusion. The efficacy, adequate control, safety, and attainability of the method allowed it to be recommended for use in neurosurgical practice when necessary.
The Notch signaling pathway is required for the expansion of undifferentiated pancreatic progenitor cells during embryonic development and has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The interaction of Notch ligands with their receptors promotes a gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage of the Notch receptor and release of the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription. We investigated the role of this pathway in PDAC progression.
We tested the effects of a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) that blocks Notch signaling in PDAC cell lines and a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC (Kras p53 L/+ mice).
Notch signaling was activated in PDAC precursors and advanced tumors. The GSI inhibited the growth of premalignant pancreatic duct-derived cells in a Notch-dependent manner. Additionally, in a panel of over 400 human solid tumor-derived cell lines, PDAC cells, as a group, were more sensitive to the GSI than any other tumor type. Finally, the GSI completely inhibited tumor development in the genetically engineered model of invasive PDAC (P < .005, chi2 test; compared with mice exposed to vehicle).
These results suggest that Notch signaling is required for PDAC progression. Pharmacologic targeting of this pathway offers therapeutic potential in this treatment-refractory malignancy.
The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently based on the clinical evaluation of extrapyramidal signs with a considerable error rate. The identification of specific markers might allow PD diagnosis before the onset of classical motor symptoms. By two-dimensional electrophoresis we identified proteome alterations in T-lymphocytes of 17 control subjects and 15 PD patients. The observed changes were used to build predictive models that were verified by the leave-one-out cross-validation. We further built two functions able to stage the subjects. We chose to verify by Western blotting the identity of spots corresponding to β-fibrinogen and transaldolase, two recurrent proteins in six out of 20 spots. β-Fibrinogen levels are lowered in PD patients, whereas a heavy transaldolase set of isoforms was more abundant. Eventually, we identified a list of seven proteins showing different levels in early-onset with respect to late-onset PD patients.
