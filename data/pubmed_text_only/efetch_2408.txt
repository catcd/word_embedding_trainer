Niacin is an effective drug for raising HDL cholesterol and reducing coronary risks, but patients show low compliance with treatment due to severe facial flushing upon taking the drug. A series of bicyclic pyrazole carboxylic acids were synthesized and tested for their ability to activate the niacin receptor. One analog, 23, showed improved potency and lacked flushing at doses that effectively altered the lipid profile of rats.
Ethinylestradiol (EE) induces intrahepatic cholestasis in experimental animals being its derivative, ethinylestradiol 17beta-glucuronide, a presumed mediator of this effect. To test whether glucuronidation is a relevant step in the pathogenesis of cholestasis induced by EE (5 mg/kg b.wt. s.c. for 5 consecutive days), the effect of simultaneous administration of galactosamine (200 mg/kg b.wt. i.p.) on biliary secretory function was studied. A single injection of this same dose of galactosamine was able to decrease hepatic UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GA) levels by 85% and excretion of EE-17beta-glucuronide after administration of a tracer dose of [3H]EE by 40%. Uridine (0.9 g/kg b.wt. i.p.) coadministration reverted the effect of galactosamine on hepatic UDP-GA levels and restored the excretion of [3H]EE-17beta-glucuronide. When administered for 5 days, galactosamine itself did not alter any of the serum markers of liver injury studied (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase) or biliary secretory function. When coadministered with EE, galactosamine partially prevented the impairment induced by this estrogen in total bile flow, the bile-salt-independent fraction of bile flow, basal bile salt secretion, and the secretory rate maximum of tauroursodeoxycholate. Uridine coadministration partially prevented galactosamine from exerting its anticholestatic effects. In conclusion, galactosamine administration partially prevented EE-induced cholestasis by a mechanism involving decreased UDP-GA availability for subsequent formation of EE 17beta-glucuronide. The evidence thus supports the hypothesis that EE 17beta-glucuronide is involved in the pathogenesis of EE cholestasis.
Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) synergistically aggravate acute lung injury related to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice, but the components in DEP responsible for this have not been identified. A study was undertaken to examine the effects of the organic chemicals (DEP-OC) and residual carbonaceous nuclei (washed DEP) derived from DEP on LPS related lung injury.
ICR mice were divided into experimental groups and vehicle, LPS, washed DEP, DEP-OC, washed DEP+LPS, and DEP-OC+LPS were administered intratracheally. The cellular profile of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, pulmonary oedema, lung histology, and expression of proinflammatory molecules and Toll-like receptors in the lung were evaluated.
Both DEP-OC and washed DEP enhanced the infiltration of neutrophils into BAL fluid in the presence of LPS. Washed DEP combined with LPS synergistically exacerbated pulmonary oedema and induced alveolar haemorrhage, which was concomitant with the enhanced lung expression of interleukin-1beta, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, and keratinocyte chemoattractant, whereas DEP-OC combined with LPS did not. Gene expression of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 was increased by combined treatment with washed DEP and LPS. The enhancement effects of washed DEP on LPS related changes were comparable to those of whole DEP.
These results suggest that the residual carbonaceous nuclei of DEP rather than the extracted organic chemicals predominantly contribute to the aggravation of LPS related lung injury. This may be mediated through the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and Toll-like receptors.
Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite this, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to COPD pathogenesis are still poorly understood.
The objective of this study was to assess IL-1 α and β expression in COPD patients and to investigate their respective roles in perpetuating cigarette smoke-induced inflammation. Functional studies were pursued in smoke-exposed mice using gene-deficient animals, as well as blocking antibodies for IL-1α and β. Here, we demonstrate an underappreciated role for IL-1α expression in COPD. While a strong correlation existed between IL-1α and β levels in patients during stable disease and periods of exacerbation, neutrophilic inflammation was shown to be IL-1α-dependent, and IL-1β- and caspase-1-independent in a murine model of cigarette smoke exposure. As IL-1α was predominantly expressed by hematopoietic cells in COPD patients and in mice exposed to cigarette smoke, studies pursued in bone marrow chimeric mice demonstrated that the crosstalk between IL-1α+ hematopoietic cells and the IL-1R1+ epithelial cells regulates smoke-induced inflammation. IL-1α/IL-1R1-dependent activation of the airway epithelium also led to exacerbated inflammatory responses in H1N1 influenza virus infected smoke-exposed mice, a previously reported model of COPD exacerbation.
This study provides compelling evidence that IL-1α is central to the initiation of smoke-induced neutrophilic inflammation and suggests that IL-1α/IL-1R1 targeted therapies may be relevant for limiting inflammation and exacerbations in COPD.
The administration of methamphetamine to experimental animals results in damage to dopaminergic neurons. In the present study, we demonstrated that a single dose (15 mg/kg) of methamphetamine results in production of oxidative stress as demonstrated by increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels in the rat striatum and prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, the results of present study provide further evidence in support of the notion that oxidative stress may play an important role in the methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.
Although converting-enzyme inhibition is of established value in the management of patients with severe chronic congestive heart failure, troublesome adverse reactions occur frequently during the course of treatment and may cause physicians to interrupt effective therapy. The three most common adverse reactions that are seen in patients with heart failure following treatment with captopril and enalapril (symptomatic hypotension, functional renal insufficiency, hyperkalaemia) are predictable consequences of interfering with the homeostatic functions of the renin-angiotensin system, which evolved millions of years ago to preserve life in sodium-depleted states. It is not surprising, therefore, that these untoward effects can be prevented or reversed by increasing the dietary intake of salt or reducing the dose of concomitantly administered diuretics; their occurrence rarely requires discontinuation of drug therapy. Recognition of this link between sodium balance and the adverse effects of converting-enzyme inhibition is important, because most patients with severe heart failure who experience such untoward reactions can nevertheless be expected to improve clinically during long-term therapy, if effective treatment is not interrupted.
To evaluate the contribution of systemic hypertension in the progression of nephropathies to glomerular sclerosis, a mild form of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis was associated with Goldblatt hypertension and studied after 18 weeks. We studied four groups: Group I, controls; Group II, Goldblatt hypertension; Group III, PAN nephrosis; and Group IV, both conditions. Systolic blood pressure, 24-h proteinuria, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, glomerular hemodynamics, and histological studies were compared among the groups. Rats in groups II and IV developed systemic hypertension, but only group IV rats showed persistent proteinuria. No alterations in lipid metabolism were present in any of the groups. The most striking findings in the micropuncture studies were a significant increase of glomerular capillary pressure in group IV rats (63.15 +/- 1.34 mm Hg) as compared to controls (48.74 +/- 0.97 mm Hg) and to groups II and III (55.31 +/- 2.11 and 48.17 +/- 1.23 mm Hg, respectively), and a marked fall in Kf in groups III and IV. Only group IV showed significant histological alterations such as glomerular sclerosis, interstitial damage, and increased glomerular area. These results suggest that, in the presence of an underlying nephropathy, a greater fraction of systemic pressure is transmitted to the glomerular capillaries when systemic hypertension is present; the resulting elevation in glomerular pressure and proteinuria seems to be responsible for the progression to glomerular sclerosis.
The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which common genetic variants can explain the variation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) plasma levels in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although low HDL-C levels have been shown to affect the severity of the clinical phenotype, little is known about the factors that determine HDL-C levels in these patients. A cohort of 1002 heterozygous FH patients was genotyped for polymorphisms in the genes encoding for ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, apolipoprotein (apo) AIV, apoCIII, apoE, cholesteryl transfer ester protein, hepatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and two paraoxonases. Multiple linear regression showed that, together, these polymorphisms explain only 3.9% of the variation of HDL-C plasma levels. When significant two-way interactions between the polymorphisms were also taken into account, the explained variation rose to 12.5%. In a regression model that also incorporated sex, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and concomitant beta-blocker use as covariates, the explained variation of HDL-C plasma levels even increased to 32.5%. This study provides direct evidence that multiple, modestly penetrant, but highly prevalent, polymorphisms can explain a substantial part of the variation of HDL-C plasma levels in a representative large cohort of heterozygous FH patients.
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI), especially from antimicrobial agents, is an important cause of serious liver disease. Amoxicillin-clavulanate (AC) is a leading cause of idiosyncratic DILI, but little is understood about genetic susceptibility to this adverse reaction.
We performed a genome-wide association study using 822,927 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from 201 White European and US cases of DILI following AC administration (AC-DILI) and 532 population controls, matched for genetic background.
AC-DILI was associated with many loci in the major histocompatibility complex. The strongest effect was with an HLA class II SNP (rs9274407, P=4.8×10(-14)), which correlated with rs3135388, a tag SNP of HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 that was previously associated with AC-DILI. Conditioned on rs3135388, rs9274407 is still significant (P=1.1×10(-4)). An independent association was observed in the class I region (rs2523822, P=1.8×10(-10)), related to HLA-A*0201. The most significant class I and II SNPs showed statistical interaction (P=.0015). High-resolution HLA genotyping (177 cases and 219 controls) confirmed associations of HLA-A*0201 (P=2×10(-6)) and HLA-DQB1*0602 (P=5×10(-10)) and their interaction (P=.005). Additional, population-dependent effects were observed in HLA alleles with nominal significance. In an analysis of autoimmune-related genes, rs2476601 in the gene PTPN22 was associated (P=1.3×10(-4)).
Class I and II HLA genotypes affect susceptibility to AC-DILI, indicating the importance of the adaptive immune response in pathogenesis. The HLA genotypes identified will be useful in studies of the pathogenesis of AC-DILI but have limited utility as predictive or diagnostic biomarkers because of the low positive predictive values.
We developed a mitomycin C (MMC)-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma cell subline, SPC-A1/DM4, from cloned SPC-A1/D13 parent cells by 1 h exposures to escalating concentrations of the drug over 17 months. A 5.9-fold resistance to MMC and a 3.8-fold cross-resistance to cisplatin were present in resistant cells compared with parent cells. This phenotype was stable in the absence of drug exposure for at least 6 months. Sodium butyrate (NaBu), a widely used differentiating agent, was shown to inhibit cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with the cytostatic concentration of 2 mM. This NaBu-induced growth inhibition was reversible. However, SPC-A1/DM4 cells, after recovery from the cytostasis induced by 2 days treatment with 2 mM NaBu, became 2-fold more sensitive to MMC than the cells not exposed to the agent. Meanwhile, the cisplatin response of these treated cells reached a level comparable to the parent cells. This modulation by NaBu of drug resistance could be retained for at least 1 month. Treatment with 2 mM NaBu for 2 days caused inhibition of DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells in the G1 and G2/M-phases of the cell cycle. Correlated with these were a marked increase of protein content in these cell subpopulations and an enhanced RNA synthesis. In addition, NaBu-treated cells acquired development of endoplasmic reticulum and accumulated lipid droplets. These morphological alterations were accompanied by a significant decrease in the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic areas. These findings suggest that NaBu is potentially useful in the treatment of drug-resistant non-small cell lung cancer. Information about the NaBu-induced phenotypic alterations may offer a clue to the understanding of its long-term effect on drug resistance.
Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress has been suggested as a mechanism underlying diabetic complications. Oxidative stress triggers cell death in various cell types, including glomerular mesangial cells which play important roles in diabetic nephropathy. In the present study, we investigated the potential cytoprotective effect of erigeroflavanone, a novel flavanone derivative from the flowers of Erigeron annuus, in cultured mouse mesangial cells using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidative stress inducer. Our data show that hydrogen peroxide induced a decrease in cell viability that was attenuated by erigeroflavanone. Hydrogen peroxide treatment increased formation of dichlorofluorescein (DCF)-sensitive intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). This enhanced ROS formation was significantly reduced by pretreatment with erigeroflavanone in a dose-dependent manner. Hydrogen peroxide treatment also induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38, and activated caspase-3. Pretreatment with erigeroflavanone inhibited hydrogen peroxide-induced activation of MAPKs and caspase-3. From these data we conclude that erigeroflavanone provides a protective effect against oxidative stress-induced cell death in mesangial cells that is associated with its antioxidant action and inhibition of MAPKs and caspase-3. These results suggest that erigeroflavanone has potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of renal diabetic complications.
Nicotine is responsible for smoking dependence and is mainly metabolised by CYP2A6. Several types of genetic polymorphism of CYP2A6 have been reported, but their relation to smoking habit and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotypes has not been fully clarified.
203 current or ex-smokers (lifelong cigarette consumption (CC) >/=10 pack years) with subclinical and established COPD phenotypes were clinically evaluated and pulmonary function tests and a chest CT scan were performed (smoker group). The non-smoker group consisted of 123 healthy volunteers. CYP2A6 genotypes were determined in both groups.
The percentage of subjects with a CYP2A6del allele (genotype D) was lower in heavy smokers (20.5%, n=88, CC >/=60 pack years) than in light smokers (37.4%, n=115, CC 10-59 pack years, chi(2)=6.8, p=0.01) or non-smokers (36.1%, n=122, chi(2)=6.0, p=0.01); lower in ex-smokers (20.7%, n=111) than in current smokers (41.3%, n=92, chi(2)=10.1, p<0.01); and lower in smokers with a high LAA (low attenuation area) score on the chest CT scan (18.4%, n=76, LAA >/=8.0) than in those with a low LAA score (37.0%, n=127, LAA <8.0, chi(2)=7.8, p<0.01).
Subjects with the CYP2A6del allele tend not to be heavy habitual smokers but can be light habitual smokers. The CYP2A6del polymorphism may inhibit smokers from giving up smoking, but appears to function as a protective factor against the development of pulmonary emphysema independent of smoking habit.
We studied the values of oral dipyridamole needed to detect coronary arterial disease using 12-lead electrocardiography. The relationship between dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression and coronary arterial lesions, coronary collaterals and myocardial infarction was investigated. 375 mg oral dipyridamole was given to 31 patients (22 with coronary arterial disease, 9 controls). 12-lead electrocardiogram was recorded before and 45 minutes after the test. The control group and the patients, who had no ST segment depression after dipyridamole, performed isometric contraction (handgrip) for 5 minutes and then the 12-lead electrocardiogram was recorded. All patients had coronary angiography. We also performed treadmill stress testing in 28 patients. Dipyridamole testing was positive (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression on electrocardiogram) in 7 of 22 patients with coronary arterial disease, of whom 6 had positive treadmill stress testing. Only 2 patients had previous myocardial infarction in the group with positive dipyridamole tests. Of the 15 in whom dipyridamole testing was negative, 5 had positive treadmill stress testing, while 13 of them had had previous myocardial infarction. All patients in the control group had negative dipyridamole stress testing and normal coronary angiograms. No additional ST segment changes were observed in the group who had performed isometric contraction test (both dipyridamole test negative and control groups). Sensitivity and specificity of the test were 32 and 100%, respectively. Comparison of collateral vessels between the groups positive and negative for dipyridamole revealed no difference. But the number of patients with old myocardial infarction was higher in those testing negative than in those who proved positive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC), an aliphatic, sulphuric compound from Brassica vegetables, possesses in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Recently we demonstrated the potent growth inhibitory potential of the DNA damaging agent MTBITC in human liver cancer cells. Here we now show that MTBITC down regulates telomerase which sensitizes cells to apoptosis induction. This is mediated by MAPK activation but independent from production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Within one hour, MTBITC induced DNA damage in cancer cells correlating to a transient increase in hTERT mRNA expression which then turned into telomerase suppression, evident at mRNA as well as enzyme activity level. To clarify the role of MAPK for telomerase regulation, liver cancer cells were pre-treated with MAPK-specific inhibitors prior to MTBITC exposure. This clearly showed that transient elevation of hTERT mRNA expression was predominantly mediated by the MAPK family member JNK. In contrast, activated ERK1/2 and P38, but not JNK, signalled to telomerase abrogation and consequent apoptosis induction. DNA damage by MTBITC was also strongly abolished by MAPK inhibition. Oxidative stress, as analysed by DCF fluorescence assay, electron spin resonance spectroscopy and formation of 4-hydroxynonenal was found as not relevant for this process. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine pre-treatment did not impact MTBITC-induced telomerase suppression or depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential as marker for apoptosis. Our data therefore imply that upon DNA damage by MTBITC, MAPK are essential for telomerase regulation and consequent growth impairment in liver tumor cells and this detail probably plays an important role in understanding the potential chemotherapeutic efficacy of ITC.
Studies have showed that inflammatory cytokines were involved in the process of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), anti-inflammation treatment ameliorated LV remodeling and improved cardiac performance. Hydroxymethylglutary coenzyme A reductase inhibition (statins) could affect the expression of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that statins have beneficial effects on early LV remodeling and cardiac performance in rats with AMI by modulating the production of inflammatory cytokines.
Rats with AMI were treated with placebo or simvastatin (gastric gavage) for 4 weeks. The pro-inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine: IL-10 excreted by cardiac myocytes was examined. Echocardiography, hemodynamics and collagen type I production were measured to evaluate LV remodeling and cardiac function.
The mRNA expression and protein production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10 in AMI group were significantly elevated compared with sham rats. Simvastatin markedly attenuated the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and increased IL-10 levels in the noninfarcted and infarcted regions, reduced collagen deposition in the noninfarcted myocardium and improved left ventricular function. However simvastatin did not alter plasma lipids.
Simvastatin ameliorates early LV remodeling and improve cardiac function after AMI. Simultaneously, it decreased pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines, which suggests, but does not prove, a causal relationship independent of plasma lipid-lowering effects.
Clonidine is a classical sympatholytic drug that is widely used for the treatment of hypertension. Experimental and clinical studies suggest that Clonidine may activate baroreflex. The aim of this study was to determine the hemodynamic response to Clonidine under physiological conditions and to test the hypothesis that Clonidine would reduce cardiac output and blood pressure resulting in an increase in total peripheral resistance.
Clonidine's hemodynamic effect was evaluated in 28 young, healthy subjects after a single i.v. dose of 1 microg x kg(- 1). Impedance cardiography, systolic time intervals and pulse wave analysis were used to characterize myocardial and vascular function.
Clonidine lowered blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular ejection time, and pulse wave velocity and increased pre-ejection period. Stroke volume and cardiac output decreased gradually over the investigation time of 240 min. Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) was lowered to a larger extent than peripheral SBP. Total peripheral resistance was characterized by an immediate fall of short duration followed by a continuous rise above baseline after 120 min. Placebo did not have any significant effect on hemodynamic parameters.
Clonidine's blood pressure lowering effect is mediated by both an immediate decrease in vascular resistance and a prolonged decrease in cardiac output, and Clonidine lowers central SBP more than peripheral SBP.
The levels of proteins that control the cell cycle are regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) by substrate-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27kip1 (p27), that blocks the cell cycle in G1, is ubiquitylated by the E3 ligase SCF-Skp2/Cks1 for degradation by the UPS. In turn, Skp2 and Cks1 are ubiquitylated by the E3 ligase complex APC/Cdh1 for destruction thereby maintaining abundant levels of nuclear p27. We previously showed that perpetual proteasomal degradation of p27 is an early event in Type I endometrial carcinogenesis (ECA), an estrogen (E2)-induced cancer. The present studies demonstrate that E2 stimulates growth of ECA cell lines and normal primary endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and induces MAPK-ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of p27 on Thr187, a prerequisite for p27 ubiquitylation by nuclear SCF-Skp2/Cks1 and subsequent degradation. In addition, E2 decreases the E3 ligase [APC]Cdh1 leaving Skp2 and Cks1 intact to cause p27 degradation. Furthermore, knocking-down Skp2 prevents E2-induced p27 degradation and growth stimulation suggesting that the pathogenesis of E2-induced ECA is dependent on Skp2-mediated degradation of p27. Conversely, progesterone (Pg) as an inhibitor of endometrial proliferation increases nuclear p27 and Cdh1 in primary EECs and ECA cells. Pg, also increases Cdh1 binding to APC to form the active E3ligase. Knocking-down Cdh1 obviates Pg-induced stabilization of p27 and growth inhibition. Notably, neither E2 nor Pg affected transcription of Cdh1, Skp2, Cks1 nor p27. These studies provide new insights into hormone regulation of cell proliferation through the UPS. The data implicates that preventing nuclear p27 degradation by blocking Skp2/Cks1-mediated degradation of p27 or increasing Cdh1 to mediate degradation of Skp2-Cks1 are potential strategies for the prevention and treatment of ECA.
The publication of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) rt-PA Stroke Trial in 1995 generated considerable hope, but also concerns as to whether the results of this carefully conducted randomized clinical trial can be replicated in routine clinical practice. Steadily accumulating data on use of intravenous t-PA for acute ischemic stroke from multiple postmarketing studies encouragingly show that low complication rates and high rates of favorable outcome can be achieved with proper use of this therapy; however, preliminary data also show that the general applicability of t-PA is uncertain, and the risk of t-PA might potentially outweigh the benefits in some circumstances. Ongoing systemic audits of t-PA use in routine clinical practice have proved useful and provide insight regarding the effect of thrombolysis in different clinical settings. Treatment with t-PA should be used by physicians who are well educated and experienced with its use, patients should be carefully selected, and treatment guidelines must be strictly adhered to. The option of treatment with t-PA is available to a small fraction of patients afflicted with acute stroke, but the proportion of patients who can be treated effectively with thrombolysis has been shown to grow with experience and better organization. Door-to-needle time in most series exceeds the recommended 60-minute goal. Over the last 5 years, large strides were made toward effective urgent therapy with t-PA, but much further work is still required to maximize the benefit for stroke victims. Modern neurovascular imaging techniques might allow for treatment to be appropriately tailored to the individual patient. For now, the original NINDS protocol for patient selection and treatment has borne itself out and remains the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke.
Our aim was to determine whether the change in left ventricular (LV) mass in response to antihypertensive treatment could be predicted by multivariate analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes reflecting pathways likely to be involved in blood pressure control.
Patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension and LV hypertrophy were randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment with either the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist irbesartan (n = 48) or the beta1 adrenoreceptor blocker atenolol (n = 49). A microarray-based minisequencing system was used for genotyping 74 SNPs in 25 genes. These genotypes were related to the change in LV mass index by echocardiography, after 12 weeks treatment as monotherapy, using stepwise multiple regression analysis.
The blood pressure reductions were similar and significant in both treatment groups. Two SNPs in two separate genes (the angiotensinogen T1198C polymorphism, corresponding to the M235T variant and the apolipoprotein B G10108A polymorphism) for those treated with irbesartan, and the adrenoreceptor alpha2A A1817G for those treated with atenolol, significantly predicted the change in LV mass. The predictive power of these SNPs was independent of the degree of blood pressure reduction.
SNPs in the angiotensinogen, apolipoprotein B, and the alpha2 adrenoreceptor gene predicted the change in LV mass during antihypertensive therapy. These results illustrate the potential of using microarray-based technology for SNP genotyping in predicting individual drug responses.
The European InnoMed-PredTox project was a collaborative effort between 15 pharmaceutical companies, 2 small and mid-sized enterprises, and 3 universities with the goal of delivering deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of kidney and liver toxicity and to identify mechanism-linked diagnostic or prognostic safety biomarker candidates by combining conventional toxicological parameters with "omics" data. Mechanistic toxicity studies with 16 different compounds, 2 dose levels, and 3 time points were performed in male Crl: WI(Han) rats. Three of the 16 investigated compounds, BI-3 (FP007SE), Gentamicin (FP009SF), and IMM125 (FP013NO), induced kidney proximal tubule damage (PTD). In addition to histopathology and clinical chemistry, transcriptomics microarray and proteomics 2D-DIGE analysis were performed. Data from the three PTD studies were combined for a cross-study and cross-omics meta-analysis of the target organ. The mechanistic interpretation of kidney PTD-associated deregulated transcripts revealed, in addition to previously described kidney damage transcript biomarkers such as KIM-1, CLU and TIMP-1, a number of additional deregulated pathways congruent with histopathology observations on a single animal basis, including a specific effect on the complement system. The identification of new, more specific biomarker candidates for PTD was most successful when transcriptomics data were used. Combining transcriptomics data with proteomics data added extra value.
Signals for cell-death induction by menadione were studied in Jurkat T cells. Low concentrations of menadione (10-20 microM) and H(2)O(2) (10-50 microM) induced cell death accompanying low (menadione: <5%) or moderate (H(2)O(2): 10-15%) levels of DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells. These concentrations of menadione (10 microM) and H(2)O(2) also caused membrane (necrotic) cell death at unproportionally high (80%) and proportional (10-30%) levels, respectively. Higher concentrations (100-5,000 microM) of H(2)O(2) exclusively induced membrane cell death. Unexpectedly, 30-300 microM menadione induced ever-decreasing levels of necrotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. An in vitro kinase assay showed that 20-50 microM, but not >100 microM, menadione induced activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), whereas a striking activation of JNK was induced by 500-5,000 microM H(2)O(2). Induction of cell death by a low concentration of menadione was partially inhibited in dominant negative JNK gene-transfected Jurkat/VPF cells. A high concentration (300 microM) of menadione was found to inhibit cell-death induction by high concentrations (200-5,000 microM) of H(2)O(2). The JNK inhibitory activity of menadione was also demonstrated in a cell-free system. However, menadione did not activate JNK in vitro. These results suggest that JNK is required for induction of not only apoptotic cell death, but also necrotic cell death in Jurkat T cells and that menadione biphasically controls this JNK-linked signal for inducing cell death.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an abnormal proliferation of the myeloid precursors and a maturation block. The most common chromosomal lesions in AML are the t(8;21) and inv(16). To better understand the leukemogenic mechanism of these fusion proteins, we performed gene expression studies in samples from (8;21), AML1 mutated and inv(16) patients, as well as from the Kasumi-1 cell line and a U937 cell line expressing the AML1-ETO fusion gene. To assess the influence of associated epigenetic lesions, we performed gene expression studies in Kasumi-1 cells and cells extracted from an Inv(16) patient, both treated with demethylating and HDAC inhibitor agents. Shared deregulated genes in the different types of core-binding factor leukemias were identified. We found a tight link between Inv(16) and mutant AML1 samples. Furthermore, some of the genes deregulated by the leukemogenic process reverted to their normal expression with demethylating and HDAC inhibitor treatment, highlighting the role of chromatin remodeling processes in AML.
The human carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) gene encodes for the enzyme carboxylesterase 1, a serine esterase governing both metabolic deactivation and activation of numerous therapeutic agents. During the course of a study of the pharmacokinetics of the methyl ester racemic psychostimulant methylphenidate, profoundly elevated methylphenidate plasma concentrations, unprecedented distortions in isomer disposition, and increases in hemodynamic measures were observed in a subject of European descent. These observations led to a focused study of the subject's CES1 gene. DNA sequencing detected two coding region single-nucleotide mutations located in exons 4 and 6. The mutation in exon 4 is located in codon 143 and leads to a nonconservative substitution, p.Gly143Glu. A deletion in exon 6 at codon 260 results in a frameshift mutation, p.Asp260fs, altering residues 260-299 before truncating at a premature stop codon. The minor allele frequency of p.Gly143Glu was determined to be 3.7%, 4.3%, 2.0%, and 0% in white, black, Hispanic, and Asian populations, respectively. Of 925 individual DNA samples examined, none carried the p.Asp260fs, indicating it is an extremely rare mutation. In vitro functional studies demonstrated the catalytic functions of both p.Gly143Glu and p.Asp260fs are substantially impaired, resulting in a complete loss of hydrolytic activity toward methylphenidate. When a more sensitive esterase substrate, p-nitrophenyl acetate was utilized, only 21.4% and 0.6% catalytic efficiency (V(max)/K(m)) were determined in p.Gly143Glu and p.Asp260fs, respectively, compared to the wild-type enzyme. These findings indicate that specific CES1 gene variants can lead to clinically significant alterations in pharmacokinetics and drug response of carboxylesterase 1 substrates.
