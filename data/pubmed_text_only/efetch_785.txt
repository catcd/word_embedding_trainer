Noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) is a newly described life-threatening liver disease of unknown cause in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. Postulated pathogenesis includes prolonged exposure to antiretroviral therapy, particularly didanosine.
We performed a nested case-control study including 15 patients with NCPH and 75 matched control subjects of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study to investigate risk factors for the development of NCPH. Matching criteria were similar duration of HIV infection, absence of viral hepatitis, and follow-up to at least the date of NCPH diagnosis in the respective case.
All 15 case patients had endoscopically documented esophageal varices and absence of liver cirrhosis on biopsies; 4 died because of hepatic complications. At NCPH diagnosis, case patients and control subjects were similar concerning sex; race; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage; HIV-RNA level; CD4 cell count nadir; and lipids and lipodystrophy. Differences were found in age (conditional logistic regression odds ratio [OR] for 10 years older, 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-6.1); homosexuality (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.2-17); current CD4 cell count <200 cells/microL (OR, 34.3; 95% CI, 4.3-277); diabetes mellitus (OR, 8.8; 95% CI, 1.6-49); alanine aminotransferase level higher than normal (OR, 13.0; 95% CI, 2.7-63); alkaline phosphatase higher than normal (OR, 18.3; 95% CI, 4.0-85); and platelets lower than normal (OR, 20.5; 95% CI, 2.4-178). Cumulative exposure to antiretroviral therapy (OR per year, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6), nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7), didanosine (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1), ritonavir (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9), and nelfinavir (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9) were longer in case patients. Exposure to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor and other protease inhibitors were not different between groups. In bivariable models, only the association of NCPH with didanosine exposure was robust; other covariables were not independent risk factors.
We found a strong association between prolonged exposure to didanosine and the development of NCPH.
Little is known about the physiological roles of the M5 muscarinic receptor, the last member of the muscarinic receptor family (M1-M5) to be cloned. In the brain, the M5 receptor subtype is preferentially expressed by dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area are known to play important roles in mediating both the rewarding effects of opiates and other drugs of abuse and the manifestations of opiate/drug withdrawal symptoms. We therefore speculated that acetylcholine-dependent activation of M5 receptors might modulate the manifestations of opiate reward and withdrawal. This hypothesis was tested in a series of behavioral, biochemical, and neurochemical studies using M5 receptor-deficient mice (M5-/- mice) as novel experimental tools. We found that the rewarding effects of morphine, as measured in the conditioned place preference paradigm, were substantially reduced in M5-/- mice. Furthermore, both the somatic and affective components of naloxone-induced morphine withdrawal symptoms were significantly attenuated in M5-/- mice. In contrast, the analgesic efficacy of morphine and the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine remained unaltered by the lack of M5 receptors. The finding that M5 receptor activity modulates both morphine reward and withdrawal processes suggests that M5 receptors may represent a novel target for the treatment of opiate addiction.
Micafungin is an echinocandin-class antifungal agent licensed for treatment of invasive disease in adults. The optimal dosing regimens have not been established for infants. We describe a premature infant who developed hepatitis and cholestasis during micafungin therapy initiated for protracted candidemia. Practitioners should be aware of this potential adverse effect if using micafungin in young patients.
The cyclic somatostatin analog, octreotide, forms the mainstay of medical treatment for acromegaly. In addition to lowering circulating growth hormone levels and shrinking tumor size, octreotide may provide symptomatic relief of headaches associated with growth hormone secreting tumors. The majority of reported complications of octreotide therapy are gastrointestinal and metabolic. The present case illustrates the development of acute bilateral cavernous sinus syndrome with loss of eye movement bilaterally during octreotide therapy. Serial MRI examination suggest tumor infarction as the etiology. The symptoms resolved over 2 months as the tumor shrunk in size and growth hormone was dramatically reduced.
Rifabutin is increasingly critical for treatment of atypical mycobacterial infections. One of its serious adverse effects is leukopenia. When encountering rifabutin-induced leukopenia, clinicians are faced with the dilemma of whether to lower the dosage of rifabutin or discontinue it because existing literature does not indicate whether rifabutin-induced leukopenia is dose related or idiosyncratic. We report the first established case of idiosyncratic rifabutin-induced leukopenia in an immunocompetent man treated for pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. The patient also developed rifabutin-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which also has not been previously reported.
Several specific renal syndromes may be induced by the interaction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) upon renal function. We report an NSAID-induced form of acute renal failure that represents a dual mechanism of impact on renal function involving direct parenchymal damage at a renal papillary level and mechanical outflow ureteric obstruction consequent to acute papillary necrosis. This form of NSAID-related acute renal failure has been reported very infrequently. We suspect the syndrome is not often recognized clinically. Clinicians and health care workers need to remind constantly the general public concerning the standard steps to be taken to ensure the proper and safe use of over-the-counter drugs. This is especially important considering the recent FDA approval of the over-the-counter sale of naproxen sodium, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen.
As effector cells in host defence, neutrophils actively destroy invading microorganisms via a potent antimicrobial arsenal composed of oxidants and antimicrobial peptides. Psoriasin, an Escherichia coli-cidal antimicrobial protein, has been found to be overexpressed in psoriasis, a skin disease characterized by infiltration of neutrophils. In addition to its microbicidal activities and chemotaxis of neutrophils reported previously, we hypothesized that psoriasin might regulate other neutrophil functions such as cytokine and chemokine production, reactive oxygen species generation, and release of antimicrobial peptides. In the current study, we demonstrate that psoriasin activates neutrophils to produce a range of cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8/CXCL8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha)/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4 and MIP-3alpha/CCL20. Furthermore, psoriasin induces phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), both of which are required for the production of cytokines and chemokines as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of p38 and ERK inhibitors on psoriasin-mediated neutrophil activation. Moreover, psoriasin stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species from neutrophils, most likely via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activation. Finally, we demonstrate that psoriasin enhances messenger RNA expression of alpha-defensins, termed human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1 to 3, and induces their extracellular release. Besides its antimicrobial properties, therefore, psoriasin may contribute to innate immunity through enhancing neutrophil host defence functions at sites of inflammation or infection.
Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy and is licensed for the treatment of breast and gastrointestinal cancers. Multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy has been associated with intravenous 5-FU, but only a few cases of capecitabine-induced encephalopathy have been reported.
We describe here a case of encephalopathy following administration of Epirubicin/ Cisplatin/Capecitabine chemotherapy, review those cases previously described and suggest recommendations for management.
Symptoms of neurotoxicity from 5-FU and capecitabine usually include confusion, ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, sensory loss, and memory loss. Withdrawal of the drug generally leads to improvement of symptoms and steroids are of only questionable benefit.
Patients on fluouropyrimidine drugs with new neurological symptoms should be investigated with brain MRI scan and the drug should be withdrawn until symptoms resolve. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency should be excluded and ideally an alternative chemotherapy regime sought. We would encourage reporting of such incidences to gain a clearer picture of the incidence and optimal management.
This randomized, controlled trial was designed to show that a short, 5-day course of pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg (Augmentin XR) is as effective clinically as a longer, 7-day course of conventional amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg (both given twice daily) in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). Amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was designed to extend the therapeutic levels of amoxicillin in serum over the 12-h dosing interval, compared with conventional formulations, to eradicate bacterial strains for which amoxicillin MICs were < or =4 microg/ml while retaining efficacy against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. A total of 893 patients were randomized and received study medication (amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg for 443 patients and 875/125 mg for 450 patients). Overall, 141 patients receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg and 135 receiving the comparator formulation had at least one pathogen identified at screening. Amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was as effective clinically in the per-protocol (PP) population at the test of cure (days 14 to 21, primary efficacy endpoint) as amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg (clinical success rates of 93.0 and 91.2%, respectively; treatment difference, 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.2, 5.7). Bacteriological success in the bacteriology PP population was high for both formulations (amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg, 76.7%; amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg, 73.0%; treatment difference, 3.8; 95% CI, -7.5, 15.0). Both therapies were well tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse events. Fewer than 5% of patients in each group withdrew from the study due to adverse events. The shorter, 5-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2,000/125 mg was shown to be as effective clinically as a longer, 7-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate at 875/125 mg, with high bacteriological efficacy and no difference in tolerability.
Between 1975 and 1986, 326 patients with stage II breast cancer were treated with an adjuvant combination of doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil (AVCF) following regional therapy (232 modified radical mastectomy, 94 lumpectomies, 304 irradiations). The AVCF regimen consisted of 4-week cycles of doxorubicin (30 mg/m2 day 1, modified radical mastectomy), vincristine (1 mg/m2 day 2), 5-fluorouracil 400 (mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2) days 3-6. Two hundred twenty-four patients (pts) had six cycles and 102 pts 12 cycles; 90 pts also received 30 mg daily tamoxifen for 1 year after chemotherapy. As of March 1994, the median follow-up was 130 months (range 86-221). One hundred eighteen pts developed recurrences (7 local, 19 controlateral, 92 metastatic) and 104 died. Estimated disease-free survival (DFS) was 5 years, 76 +/- 5%; 10 years, 64 +/- 5%; 15 years, 54 +/- 9%. Overall survival (OS) was 5 years, 85 +/- 4%; 10 years, 70 +/- 5%; 15 years, 58 +/- 10%. Survival was affected by the number of involved lymph nodes (258 pts were N+), menopausal status (OS at 15 years: 53% for MP+ and 65% for MP-) and Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading, but not by hormonal receptors, number of courses, or associated hormonotherapy. Minimal cardiac toxicity was induced by doxorubicin either during or subsequent to treatment completion.
Women on hormonal therapy for menorrhagia are at risk for cerebral venous thrombosis.
This scenario may become complicated when there is profuse vaginal bleed with the withdrawal of hormonal therapy. There are no reports describing the possible therapeutic approaches in this clinical situation.
A 42-year-old female with a history of uterine fibroids and menorrhagia taking an estrogen-progesterone combination pill presented with seizure clusters. Neuro-imaging showed lateral sinus thrombosis and biparietal hemorrhagic infarcts. Withdrawal of the contraceptive pill was associated with profuse vaginal bleed, leading to hemodynamic instability and the need for multiple blood transfusions. As an emergent procedure to stop the vaginal bleeding, the patient was implanted with a levonorgestrel intrauterine system; with this, vaginal bleed stopped within 12 hours with hemodynamic stability. Subsequently, the patient was treated with unfractionated heparin followed by warfarin (target international normalized ratio: 2.5-3). She made a good neurological recovery.
This case illustrates that LNG-IUS can be an innovative choice for local hormonal therapy in a patient with OCP-related cerebral venous thrombosis and simultaneous vaginal bleeding.
Yohimbine is an alpha 2 adrenoreceptor antagonist occasionally used in the treatment of impotence. Overdose of this drug is uncommon. We describe a 62-year-old male who ingested 100, 2.0 mg tablets whose only adverse effects were tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety of brief duration. The limited experience to date suggests a benign course even after massive overdose. Observation would seem to be the management of choice.
To prevent Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in rat model, we evaluated the feasibility of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a gene transfer target and studied the efficiency of recombinant adenovirus mediated gene therapy.
We constructed the recombinant adenovirus containing CTLA4Ig gene. Rat MSCs of passages 3-5 were infected by the adenovirus, and the transfection efficiency was monitored by GFP markers. We performed flow cytometric analysis, immunohistochemical and Western blotting analysis to identify the CTLA4Ig expression. The gene transferred MSCs were tested for their ability to inhibit the allogeneic lymphocyte response in vitro and to prevent GVHD in a rat model.
Recombinant adenovirus pAd-CTLA4Ig was correctly constructed and confirmed. After MSCs were infected by the adenovirus, the CTLA4Ig protein was detected not only in transgenic MSCs, but also in the culture medium. In a mixed lymphocytes response (MLR) test, the transgenic MSCs could significantly inhibit the allogeneic lymphocyte response compared with the control groups (P < 0.05). A model of GVHD was developed by transplanting bone marrow cells and spleen lymphocytes of F344 rats to lethally irradiated SD rats. The onset of GVHD could be ameliorated or prevented by co-administration of transgenic MSCs. All the rats in the control groups suffered severe acute GVHD. CTLA4Ig expression was observed in the liver, intestine, kidney and spleen 30 days post-transplantation.
Our results indicate that adenoviral vectors could efficiently transfer CTLA4Ig gene into MSCs and sustain long-term stable expression in vitro and in vivo.
To examine the impact of individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring (IPM) on the development of aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity (AAN).
Retrospective case-control study.
Two teaching hospitals.
Two thousand four hundred five patients who received aminoglycosides.
Aminoglycoside therapy dosed by either IPM or physicians' directions.
Patients receiving IPM were significantly less likely to develop AAN by both univariate (7.9% vs 13.2%, p=0.02) and multivariate methods (odds ratio 0.42, p=0.002). Female sex was protective against AAN. Age 50 years and above, high initial aminoglycoside trough, long duration of therapy, and concurrent piperacillin, clindamycin, or vancomycin increased risk of AAN. We estimated that IPM decreased AAN costs by $90,995/100 patients.
Individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring significantly decreased the frequency of AAN and its associated economic costs.
Gravid Sprague-Dawley-derived rats were injected SC twice daily with either 20 or 40 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium (PT), sodium phenobarbital (PH), or the same volume of the saline vehicle on days 9-21 of pregnancy. Pair-feeding was employed. Vital, developmental, and activity measures were obtained on the neonates and locomotor activity was measured from 3-10 months of age. Avoidance was measured sequentially in a shuttle box, and in an operant chamber beginning at 3 months of age. The PH-80 dams gained less weight over the gestational period, and PH-80 and PH-40 offspring had more neonatal deaths. These male offspring were hyperactive at maturity, and PH-80 rats were initially slower to escape experimenter-initiated shock. PT exposure caused transient neonatal and juvenile hyperactivity. PT rats performed more poorly on both the conditioned avoidance and Sidman shock schedules, and had significantly lower brain: body weight ratios at 1 year of age. All four drug groups outperformed the saline offspring on subject-initiated shock schedules (punishment). Sex of offspring was determined on postnatal day 4 and the sex ratio was shifted towards male births with both drugs relative to controls.
Cetuximab and erlotinib, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, often cause peculiar adverse cutaneous reactions.
Our aim was to evaluate adverse cutaneous reactions and their management in patients undergoing treatment with cetuximab and erlotinib.
Between March/2005 and September/2009, we observed 14 patients with a mean age of 59.6 years undergoing treatment with cetuximab (7) or erlotinib (7), due to lung(10) or colorectal cancer (4). We evaluated the interval between introduction of the drug and onset of symptoms, treatment response, and the clinical pattern of evolution of the cutaneous reaction retrospectively.
Twelve patients presented papular-pustular eruption typically affecting the face, chest and back, which appeared in average 13.5 days after starting the drug treatment. The patients underwent oral treatment with minocycline or doxycycline and topical treatment with metronidazole, benzoyl peroxide and/or corticosteroids. All patients showed improvement of the lesions. Five patients presented periungual pyogenic granulomas, which were associated with paronychia in 4 cases, after an average of 8 weeks of treatment. There was improvement of the lesions with topical treatment (antibiotics, corticosteroids and antiseptics). Xerosis was observed in some patients. Other less frequent adverse side effects such as telangiectasia and angiomas, hair and eyelash alterations, and eruptive melanocytic nevi were also described. Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor was maintained in most patients.
The increasing use of these targeted therapies requires knowledge of their adverse cutaneous side effects to ensure timely intervention in order to allow the continuation of the therapy.
A 46-year-old previously healthy woman was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The induction phase was complicated by alpha-haemolytic streptococcal bacteremia which responded to antibacterial therapy. Subsequently, the patient developed pneumonie due to Chlamydiapneumoniae which responded to macrolides. Following this infection the patient developed recurrent fever and new pulmonary infiltrates were noted. Bronchoscopy was performed and treatment was administered with liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB, AmBisome) for two days, but was complicated by acute renal failure. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [corrected] L-AmB was discontinued and voriconazole and caspofungin were administered. Despite aggressive antifungal therapy the patient developed progressive invasive infection, with central nervous system involvement as well as lesions appearing in the kidneys and liver. The patient died one week following the diagnosis of aspergillosis.
In a man with severe mental retardation, minor facial and genital anomalies, disproportionate short stature and a broad thorax, we identified a de novo Xq13.2q21.1 duplication by array CGH. This 7 Mb duplication encompasses 23 known genes, including the X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) genes ATRX and SLC16A2. The phenotype of this patient is similar to that described in more than 10 previously reported patients with overlapping Xq duplications. Detailed comparison of the clinical characteristics and the function of the genes located in the commonly duplicated regions of these patients led us to the hypothesis that an increased dosage of ATRX and perhaps of other genes is involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of this XLMR phenotype, including mental retardation, short stature, and genital abnormalities comprising cryptorchidism and/or a small penis.
The specific contribution of high-dose carboplatin to regimen-related toxicity after autologous transplantation has been difficult to determine, particularly in patients receiving cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide. We report five cases of severe multi-system failure in patients receiving high-dose carboplatin in addition to other cytotoxics prior to autologous transplantation. Two of these patients did not receive ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide as part of their chemotherapy. The clinical picture consisted of early onset acute renal failure, arrhythmias and/or myocardial hypokinesia, mental obtundation and other neurological deficits and, in two patients, an acute myopathy. In the two patients in whom serum platinum was measured, levels were very high at the time of marrow infusion. All patients had received prior cisplatin therapy but showed either normal or only modestly impaired creatinine clearance before the transplant. These observations are consistent with a specific clinical syndrome associated with carboplatin toxicity and suggest that creatinine clearance may be inadequate as an indicator of potential renal failure when high-dose carboplatin is used.
Report on a case of cardiac arrest and coma lasting 10 hours secondary to the i.v. administration of 2 mg Flunitrazepam. The possible cardiorespiratory depressant respectively cerebral side-effects of Flunitrazepam are discussed. The high concentration of Flunitrazepam in the registered ampules is misleading to overdosage.
Since indomethacin may be effective in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension, the ability of this drug to increase reflex vasoconstriction was studied in six patients with orthostatic hypotension and in five normal subjects. Reflex forearm vasoconstriction during lower body negative pressure at 20-40 mm Hg was measured before and after indomethacin 50 mg by mouth. In patients with orthostatic hypotension and central nervous system involvement indomethacin increased recumbent blood pressure, resting forearm vascular resistance, and reflex forearm vasoconstriction during lower body negative pressure. The fall in blood pressure with lower body negative pressure was not significantly inhibited by indomethacin, but mean blood pressure during lower body negative pressure was higher after than before indomethacin. Indomethacin did not alter these responses in normal subjects. The increase in reflex vasoconstriction with indomethacin may contribute to its therapeutic effects in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a skin disease encountered in the East Mediterranean Region including Egypt. In this paper, it was intended to throw some light on the clinical picture of six parasitologically proven human CL. Also, the results of treating three cases of them with Pontostam or Cryosurgery. The whole results were discussed.
Ubiquitinated-protein aggregates are implicated in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The very presence of these ubiquitinated-protein aggregates is abnormal and seems to be disease-related. However, it is not clear what leads to aggregate formation and whether the aggregations represent a reaction to aggregate-mediated neurodegeneration.
To study the nitrosative stress-induced protein aggregation in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, we used primary astrocyte cultures as a cell model, and systematically examined their iNOS expression and consequent NO generation following oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion. The expression of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) were also examined, and the biochemical interaction between PDI and SOD1 was determined by immunoprecipitation. In addition, the levels of S-nitrosylated PDI in cultured astrocytes after oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion treatment were measured using the biotin-switch assay. The formation of ubiquitinated-protein aggregates was detected by immunoblot and immunofluorescence staining.
Our data showed that the up-regulation of iNOS expression after oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion treatment led to excessive NO generation. Up-regulation of PDI and SOD1 was also identified in cultured astrocytes following oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion, and these two proteins were found to bind to each other. Furthermore, the increased nitrosative stress due to ischemia/reperfusion injury was highly associated with NO-induced S-nitrosylation of PDI, and this S-nitrosylation of PDI was correlated with the formation of ubiquitinated-protein aggregates; the levels of S-nitrosylated PDI increased in parallel with the formation of aggregates. When NO generation was pharmacologically inhibited by iNOS specific inhibitor 1400W, S-nitrosylation of PDI was significantly blocked. In addition, the formation of ubiquitinated-protein aggregates in cultured astrocytes following oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion was also suppressed by 1400W. Interestingly, these aggregates were colocalized with SOD1, which was found to co-immunoprecipitate with PDI.
NO-mediated S-nitrosylation of PDI may be involved in the formation of the SOD1-linked ubiquitinated-protein aggregates in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Hiccups generally are self-limiting and of short duration. Those lasting more than 48 h or recurring at frequent intervals are termed persistent. There are numerous causes of hiccups, with medications implicated only rarely. While hiccups are usually benign, severe attacks may lead to exhaustion, eating difficulties, and affect quality of life. We report a case of severe hiccups in a patient receiving chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin) for metastatic colorectal cancer. Hiccups began on the day following chemotherapy and continued constantly for over 30 h until relief was obtained by sucking the juice of a fresh lemonade. A similar pattern occurred in the next two chemotherapy cycles. Dexamethasone had been prescribed as prophylaxis against emesis and this was considered a possible cause. Withholding dexamethasone in the next cycle led to elimination of hiccups without having an impact on control of nausea and vomiting. A number of case reports have linked corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, to the occurrence of hiccups. Antineoplastic agents have occasionally been reported as causing hiccups; however, in most of these cases, corticosteroids, as part of the treatment protocol or as antiemetics, may have been a more likely cause. This case serves an as important reminder that adverse effects appearing during chemotherapy may not necessarily be due to antineoplastic agents. In the case of hiccups, oncology health professionals should review all medications and non drug-related factors before assigning causality.
Homeostatic interactions between dopamine and glutamate are central to the normal physiology of the basal ganglia. This relationship is altered in Parkinsonism and in levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID), resulting in an upregulation of corticostriatal glutamatergic function. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a tryptophan metabolite with antagonist activity at ionotropic glutamate receptors and the capability to inhibit glutamate release presynaptically, might therefore be of therapeutic value in LID. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used a pharmacological tool, the kynurenine 3-hydroxylase inhibitor Ro 61-8048, which raises KYNA levels acutely. Ro 61-8048 was tested in MPTP cynomolgus monkeys with a stable parkinsonian syndrome and reproducible dyskinesias after each dose of levodopa. Serum and CSF concentrations of KYNA and its precursor kynurenine increased dose-dependently after Ro 61-8048 administration, alone or in combination with levodopa. Coadministration of Ro 61-8048 with levodopa produced a moderate but significant reduction in the severity of dyskinesias while maintaining the motor benefit. These results suggest that elevation of KYNA levels through inhibition of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase constitutes a promising novel approach for managing LID in Parkinson's disease.
Benzene is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant primarily metabolized by a cytochrome P-450 (CYP-450) isoenzyme, CYP-450 IIE1. A consistent induction of CYP450 IIE1 has been observed in both rat and human affected by diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes determines modifications in the metabolic pathways of benzene in rat. Benzene (100 mg/kg per day, dissolved in corn oil) was administered i.p. once a day for 5 days. Urine samples were collected every day in STZ-treated and normoglycaemic animals, treated and untreated with benzene (n = 10). Urinary levels of trans,trans-muconic acid and of phenol, catechol and hydroquinone (free and conjugated with sulphuryl and glucuronic group) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In normoglycaemic rats during the 5 days of treatment with benzene we observed a progressive and significant decrement in the urinary excretion of phenol, phenyl sulphate and glucuronide, catechol, catechol glucuronide, hydroquinone, hydroquinone glucuronide and t,t-muconic acid (P < 0. 05). In the diabetic animals, conversely, the same metabolites showed progressively increasing urinary levels (P < 0.05). Catechol sulphate and hydroquinone sulphate levels were below the instrument's detection limit. In the comparison between diabetic and normoglycaemic benzene treated rats, the inter-group difference was significant (P < 0.05) from day 3 of treatment for t,t-muconic acid, and from day 1 for free and conjugated phenol, free and glucuronide catechol and free hydroquinone. In the normoglycaemic rat exposed to benzene the decreasing trend observed in urinary excretion of free and conjugated metabolites may be due to their capability to reduce cytochromial activity. Conversely, in the diabetic rat, urinary levels of benzene metabolites tended to increase progressively, probably due to the consistent induction of CYP-450 IIE1 observed in diabetes, which would overwhelm the inhibition of this isoenzyme caused by phenolic metabolites. Furthermore, the metabolic switch towards detoxification metabolites observed after administration of high doses of benzene is not allowed in the diabetic because of reduced glutathione-S-transferase activity. As a consequence, higher levels of hydroquinone, phenol and catechol, considered the actual metabolites responsible for benzene toxicity, will accumulate in the diabetic rat. Extrapolating these data to human, we may thus suggest that occupational exposure to benzene of a diabetic subject poses a higher risk level, as his metabolism tends to produce and accumulate higher levels of reactive benzene catabolites.
