The relationship between exposure to traffic induced particles, respiratory health and cardiac diseases was studied in the RHINE Tartu cohort. A postal questionnaire with commonly used questions regarding respiratory symptoms, cardiac disease, lifestyle issues such as smoking habits, indoor environment, occupation, early life exposure and sleep disorders was sent to 2,460 adults. The annual concentrations of local traffic induced particles were modelled with an atmospheric dispersion model with traffic flow data, and obtained PM(exhaust) concentrations in 40 x 40 m grids were linked with home addresses with GIS. The relationship between the level of exhaust particles outside home and self-reported health problems were analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model. We found a significant relation between fine exhaust particles and cardiac disease, OR = 1.64 (95% CI 1.12-2.43) for increase in PM(exhaust) corresponding to the fifth to the 95th percentile range. The associations also were positive but non-significant for hypertension OR = 1.42 (95% CI 0.94-2.13), shortness of breath OR = 1.27 (95% CI 0.84-1.94) and other respiratory symptoms.
It is proposed that contrast-induced nephropathy (CN) correlates with the use of increasing contrast volumes during coronary angiography. This supposition has led to the current recommendation to limit the dose of contrast in patients at high risk for renal dysfunction. Limits in contrast dosing may negatively impact the evaluation of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome. The objective of this study was to empirically assess, in a large population, the presence and strength of this correlation. Baseline blood samples and clinical information were obtained from 5256 consenting patients hospitalized for coronary angiography. Levels of serum creatinine were measured pre- and postcatheterization, and the total change in serum creatinine was calculated. Nephropathy was defined as a change of > or =0.5 mg/dL. The total volume of contrast dye (iopamidol, nonionic) used during the angiography procedure was recorded. Logistic regression was used for the primary analysis.The average age was 64 +/- 14 years, and 67% of patients were male. Paradoxically, the incidence of CN was inversely related to the volume in the overall population: 16%, 14%, 8%, and 7% for quartile (Q) 1 (<115 mL), Q2 (115-160 mL), Q3 (161-225 mL), and Q4 (>225 mL) of contrast, respectively (P-trend <0.001). In multivariable regression, this trend toward lower CN remained (Q1 (referent) OR = 1.0, Q2: 1.02, Q3: 0.60, Q4: 0.53, P < 0.001). Other predictors included age, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes, and baseline creatinine level (all P < 0.001). For patients at high risk, with a baseline creatinine >2.0 mg/dL (n = 415), contrast volume (Q1: <75 mL, Q2: 75-120 mL, Q3: 121-170 mL, Q4: >170 mL) did not predict either increased or decreased risk of CN (48%, 42%, 49%, 43%, respectively, P-trend = 0.76). This lack of predictive value remained after multivariable adjustment.In this large population, no association was found between the amount of contrast used during angiography and the incidence of CN in patients at initial high risk. The apparent inverse relation of risk with volume in the overall population is likely explained by clinical practice bias. If confirmed, these results may have important clinical implications.
To describe the characteristics and outcome in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain associated with cocaine use, the majority of whom underwent early rest perfusion imaging.
From January 1994 to June 1996, 218 patients had 241 ED visits for evaluation of symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia after cocaine use. High-risk patients (N=25) were admitted directly to the CCU for exclusion of myocardial infarction (MI). Moderate- to low-risk patients (N=216) were promptly injected with technetium-99m sestamibi in the ED and underwent gated myocardial perfusion imaging 60 to 90 minutes later. Moderate-risk patients were observed in the CCU, whereas low-risk patients with negative perfusion imaging results were discharged home directly from the ED.
A diagnosis of MI was made in 6 patients, 4 of whom had ECG findings consistent with MI. Of the 216 patients who underwent perfusion imaging, 5 had positive study results, including 2 with MI. None of the 38 patients with negative results after perfusion imaging who were admitted to the CCU had a diagnosis of MI. Only 6 of the 67 patients undergoing stress perfusion imaging had reversible perfusion defects. At 30-day follow-up, there were no cardiac events in patients with negative results after rest perfusion imaging.
Acute MI is infrequent in patients presenting with cocaine-associated chest pain. Positive results after rest perfusion imaging are uncommon, suggesting that myocardial ischemia is infrequently the cause of cocaine-associated chest pain. Early perfusion imaging may offer an effective alternative to routine CCU admission of patients with cocaine-related cardiac symptoms.
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of muscarinic receptor agonists on models of psychosis in rats. A battery of three tests, catalepsy (haloperidol-induced) augmentation, amphetamine-induced stereotypy antagonism and conditioned avoidance response were used. Both muscarinic receptor agonists physostigmine and pilocarpine produced similar results. They dose-dependently augmented the haloperidol-induced catalepsy, inhibited amphetamine-induced stereotypy behavior and inhibited the conditioned avoidance response. Results demonstrate that muscarinic receptor agonists have actions similar to those of dopamine receptor antipsychotic drugs in animal models, suggesting that muscarinic receptor agonists may be used as adjuvant drugs in the treatment of psychosis.
Autism is a complex childhood neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Microdeletion or duplication of a approximately 500-700-kb genomic rearrangement on 16p11.2 that contains 24 genes represents the second most frequent chromosomal disorder associated with autism. The role of common and rare 16p11.2 sequence variants in autism etiology is unknown.
To identify common 16p11.2 variants with a potential role in autism, we performed association studies using existing data generated from three microarray platforms: Affymetrix 5.0 (777 families), Illumina 550 K (943 families), and Affymetrix 500 K (60 families). No common variants were identified that were significantly associated with autism. To look for rare variants, we performed resequencing of coding and promoter regions for eight candidate genes selected based on their known expression patterns and functions. In total, we identified 26 novel variants in autism: 13 exonic (nine non-synonymous, three synonymous, and one untranslated region) and 13 promoter variants. We found a significant association between autism and a coding variant in the seizure-related gene SEZ6L2 (12/1106 autism vs. 3/1161 controls; p = 0.018). Sez6l2 expression in mouse embryos was restricted to the spinal cord and brain. SEZ6L2 expression in human fetal brain was highest in post-mitotic cortical layers, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Association analysis of SEZ6L2 in an independent sample set failed to replicate our initial findings.
We have identified sequence variation in at least one candidate gene in 16p11.2 that may represent a novel genetic risk factor for autism. However, further studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.
A 57-year-old woman developed bilateral optic neuritis after being treated for 6 months with tamoxifen in the dosage of 30 to 40 mg orally a day. As the neuritis progressed during continued treatment and no other causal explanation could be found, tamoxifen was stopped and the optic neuritis regressed. Since tamoxifen might cause optic neuritis the authors recommend the monitoring of ocular symptoms in treated patients.
Baclofen is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. An abrupt decrease in the dose of baclofen due to surgery or a rapid tapering program may result in severe baclofen withdrawal syndrome manifesting hallucinations, delirium, seizures, and high fever. Severe baclofen withdrawal syndrome secondary to intentional overdose, however, has not received mention.
A 42-year-old male receiving chronic baclofen therapy, 20 mg/d, attempted suicide by ingesting at least 800 mg of baclofen. He was found in coma 2 hours postingestion with depressed respirations, areflexia, hypotonia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Treatment with intravenous fluids, atropine, dopamine, and hemodialysis was associated with restoration of consciousness within 2 days but disorientation, hallucinations, fever, delirium, hypotension, bradycardia, and coma developed during the following week. Baclofen withdrawal syndrome was not diagnosed until hospital day 9, when reinstitution of baclofen rapidly stabilized his condition. Oral overdosage of baclofen causes severe neurological and cardiovascular manifestations due to its GABA and dominant cholinergic effects. Severe baclofen withdrawal syndrome is manifest by neuropsychiatric manifestations and hemodynamic instability. Caution should be exercised after a baclofen overdose in patients receiving chronic baclofen therapy.
Liver abscesses caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are rarely reported. We report such a case in a 25-year-old man who presented with an intermittent fever. He had a history of prolonged antibiotic use for acne and skin abscesses. The liver abscess was successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and a prolonged course of linezolid. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus liver abscess in Hong Kong, demonstrating the increasing threat posed by this multidrug-resistant organism. This case also suggests that a different epidemiology and route of infection may apply to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus liver abscesses in contrast to the more common pyogenic liver abscesses.
Angiotensin II-induced hypertension is associated with NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent superoxide production in the vessel wall. Vascular superoxide level is also increased in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension, which is associated with a markedly depressed plasma renin activity because of sodium retention. However, the mechanisms underlying superoxide production in low-renin hypertension are undefined.
This study investigated (1) whether and how endothelin-1 (ET-1), which is increased in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, contributes to arterial superoxide generation and (2) the effect of gene transfer of manganese superoxide dismutase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Both superoxide and ET-1 levels were significantly elevated in carotid arteries of DOCA-salt rats compared with that of the sham-operated controls. ET-1 concentration-dependently stimulated superoxide production in vitro in carotid arteries of normotensive rats. The increase in arterial superoxide in both ET-1-treated normotensive and DOCA-salt rats was reversed by a selective ET(A) receptor antagonist, ABT-627, the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin but not by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(omega)-L-arginine methyl ester or the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. Furthermore, in vivo blockade of ET(A) receptors significantly reduced arterial superoxide levels, with a concomitant decrease of systolic blood pressure in DOCA-salt rats. Ex vivo gene transfer of manganese superoxide dismutase or endothelial nitric oxide synthase also suppressed superoxide levels in carotid arteries of DOCA-salt rats.
These findings suggest that ET-1 augments vascular superoxide production at least in part via an ET(A)/NADPH oxidase pathway in low-renin mineralocorticoid hypertension.
In the present paper, we report four very elderly patients (80 years of age or older) with primary nephrotic syndrome. In all patients, oral prednisolone (PSL) alternative day therapy was attempted and three patients responded very well (complete remission 2, partial remission 1). However, one patient exhibited no effect of PSL and died from acute oliguric renal failure in spite of aggressive measures including hemodialysis. Fracture of the femoral neck occurred in one patient during PSL therapy, although the relationship between the fracture and PSL therapy was uncertain. In addition to our reported cases, 5 cases of nephrotic syndrome in similar patients reported elsewhere are analyzed together with our cohort. PSL was commonly effective in inducing remission in very elderly patients (7 of 9 patients; 78%). Very elderly patients with nephrotic syndrome frequently suffer from oliguric renal failure, which has a potentially high mortality. Based on these data, we conclude that PSL therapy can ameliorate primary nephrotic syndrome in patients over the age of eighty years. However, the complications both of the disease and its treatment, (e.g., acute oliguric renal failure, hip fracture) must be carefully monitored.
A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
Interferon beta and statins are known to exert immunomodulatory actions by inhibiting gene transcription and translation of various proinflammatory molecules. Although interferon beta represents a mainstay in therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS), statins are considered a potential new approach in treating MS.
To investigate the effect of interferon beta and statins on the posttranslational activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from mononuclear cells in vitro that were obtained from patients with MS and healthy donors.
Blood samples from 10 patients with a relapsing-remitting course of MS and 5 matched healthy individuals were studied. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and stimulated with an antibody to CD3, phytohemagglutinin, or medium alone as a negative control. Proteolytic activity was investigated in the supernatants by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymography in which gels were incubated with interferon beta or simvastatin during development. Zones of gelatin digestion were visualized and quantified.
Incubation with interferon beta resulted in an inhibition of the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2. In contrast, simvastatin enhanced the proteolytic capacity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, with a statistically significant increase of MMP-2 activity when compared with findings in controls. There were no differences in the enzymatic response between patients with MS and healthy individuals.
Interferon beta exhibits inhibitory effects at the posttranslational level of MMP activity, whereas simvastatin augments the proteolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, suggesting that statins exert anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects. This dual mechanism of action should be considered, given the recent interest in developing these drugs for treatment of MS.
Oral administration of different doses (0.0625, 0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg corresponding to 1/1400th, 1/700th or 1/350th of LD(50)) of lindane to the pregnant Wistar rats from gestation days 5 to 21 were found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) and N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMA-d) in brain and liver of offspring postnatally at 3 weeks. The increase in the activity of CYP monooxygenases was found to be associated with the increase in the mRNA and protein expression of xenobiotic metabolizing CYP1A, 2B and 2E1 isoenzymes in the brain and liver of offspring. Dose-dependent alterations in the parameters of spontaneous locomotor activity in the offspring postnatally at 3 weeks have suggested that increase in CYP activity may possibly lead to the formation of metabolites to the levels that may be sufficient to alter the behavioral activity of the offspring. Interestingly, the inductive effect on cerebral and hepatic CYPs was found to persist postnatally up to 6 weeks in the offspring at the relatively higher doses (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg) of lindane and up to 9 weeks at the highest dose (0.25 mg/kg), though the magnitude of induction was less than that observed at 3 weeks. Alterations in the parameters of spontaneous locomotor activity in the offspring postnatally at 6 and 9 weeks, though significant only in the offspring at 3 and 6-week of age, have further indicated that due to the reduced activity of the CYPs during the ontogeny, lindane and its metabolites may not be effectively cleared from the brain. The data suggest that low dose prenatal exposure to the pesticide has the potential to produce overexpression of xenobiotic metabolizing CYPs in brain and liver of the offspring which may account for the behavioral changes observed in the offspring.
The treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is often inadequate and frequently limited by the systemic adverse effects of medications, necessitating the evaluation of novel treatments.
To evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, and impact on quality of life of the 5% lidocaine patch in painful diabetic polyneuropathy.
Open-label, flexible-dosing, 3-week study with a 5-week extension.
Outpatient clinics and clinical research centers.Patients Volunteer sample of 56 patients with clinically defined painful diabetic polyneuropathy of longer than 3 months' duration. Intervention The 5% lidocaine patch, with a maximum of 4 patches daily for 18 hours.
Change in mean daily pain diary ratings from baseline to week 3. Secondary end points included assessments of safety, tolerability, and quality of life.
Patients with painful diabetic polyneuropathy showed significant improvements in pain and quality-of-life outcome measures during a 3-week treatment period. These benefits were maintained in a subgroup of patients treated for an additional 5 weeks, during which taper of concomitant analgesic therapy was permitted. Adverse events were minimal, and systemic accumulation of lidocaine did not occur.
Up to four 5% lidocaine patches for up to 18 h/d are well tolerated in patients with painful diabetic polyneuropathy, significantly improve pain and quality-of-life ratings, and may allow tapering of concomitant analgesic therapy. Given the open-label design of this trial, a randomized controlled trial is necessary to confirm these results.
The cerebral effects of hypotension induced by inhalation of increasing concentrations of isoflurane or intravenous administration of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) were studied in 15 dogs anesthetized with 1% isoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide during normocarbic (PaCO2 approximately 39 mmHg) and normothermic (37.5 degrees C) condition. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was decreased stepwise to 25, 40, and 55% of its baseline values. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using the venous outflow technique. Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) and oxygen/glucose index (OGI) were calculated, and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) and EEG were also recorded at each decrement in MAP and after resuming the control condition. The CBF, CMRO2, CMRgl, OGI and CSFP responses related to hypotension showed no significant changes from baseline values in both methods. However, CBF values in isoflurane-induced hypotension at 25% and 40% reduction of MAP were significantly higher than those in PGE1-induced hypotension. By increasing concentration of isoflurane, EEG changed from continuous fast wave to high amplitude (100 microV) slow wave (4-6 Hz) and typical burst suppression observed in 3 of 8 dogs. In contrast, no significant EEG changes were seen during PGE1-induced hypotension. These results suggest no adverse effect of isoflurane- and PGE1-induced hypotension on cerebral metabolism or function.
Sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) reduce restenosis compared with bare metal stents. Safety issues with drug-eluting stents are particularly important given concerns of possible increased thrombogenicity. Compared with heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin has been shown to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications in patients receiving bare metal stents, with similar efficacy in preventing ischemic complications. The safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with SESs and bivalirudin anticoagulation have not been prospectively studied. This prospective study performed at 9 United States hospitals evaluated 1,182 patients referred for PCI with SESs in whom the procedural anticoagulant was bivalirudin. Clopidogrel was administered before PCI in 79% of patients, and only 5.3% received procedural glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. At 30 days, major adverse cardiac events occurred in 7.1% of patients, including 0.3% mortality, 4.4% myocardial infarction (defined as creatine kinase-MB >3x normal), 1.7% target vessel revascularization, and 0.6% stent thrombosis. Major bleeding occurred in only 0.8% of patients. Thus, use of bivalirudin as the procedural anticoagulant to support SES implantation in a "real world" population of patients undergoing PCI results in low rates of major adverse cardiac events, stent thrombosis, and major bleeding.
Among the common side effects of diphenylhydantoin (DPH) overdose, the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of cerebellar dysfunction. Very rarely, the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin. Two patients are presented who suffered progressive hemiparesis due to DPH overdose. Both had brain surgery before DPH treatment. It is assumed that patients with some cerebral damage are liable to manifest DPH toxicity as focal neurological signs.
Sex-specific differences in pulmonary morbidity in adults and preterm infants are well documented. Hyperoxia contributes to lung injury in experimental animals and humans. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A enzymes have been shown to play a mechanistic role in hyperoxic lung injury (HLI) in animal models. Whether CYP1A enzymes contribute to gender-specific differences in relation to HLI is unknown. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that mice will display gender-specific differences in HLI, and that this phenomenon will be altered in mice lacking the genes for Cyp1a1 or 1a2. Eight week-old male and female wild type (WT) (C57BL/6J) mice, Cyp1a1-/-, and Cyp1a2-/- mice were exposed to 72h of hyperoxia (FiO2>0.95). Lung injury and inflammation were assessed and pulmonary and hepatic CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 levels were quantified at the enzyme activity, protein and mRNA level. Upon exposure to hyperoxia, liver and lung microsomal proteins showed higher pulmonary CYP1A1 (apoprotein level and activity) in WT females compared to WT males and a greater induction in hepatic CYP1A2 mRNA levels and activity in WT females after hyperoxia exposure. The gender based female advantage was lost or reversed in Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a2-/- mice. These findings suggest an important role for CYP1A enzymes in the gender-specific modulation of hyperoxic lung injury.
Intraoperative hypertension over 160 mmHg systolic and sinus tachycardia over 100 bpm are often observed during total intravenous anesthesia with droperidol, fentanyl and ketamine. Fifty-seven surgical patients who developed hypertension over 160 mmHg systolic during various operative procedures under this type of anesthesia were given diltiazem intravenously to overcome the situation. Their blood pressure and heart rate decreased soon after the administration of diltiazem. The rate pressure product was reduced significantly. Neither preoperative hypertension nor difference of doses between 5 mg and 10 mg of diltiazem had any significant relationship with hypotensive effect of intravenous diltiazem. But the higher the systolic-pressure was just before the administration of diltiazem, the more effective diltiazem was. No adverse effects with this drug was observed. We can conclude that intravenous diltiazem in a dose of 5 mg or 10 mg may be repeatedly given to overcome hypertension or sinus tachycardia during this type of anesthesia without any adverse effects.
A case of prolonged succinylcholine-induced paralysis in a child with organophosphate insecticide poisoning is presented. Three hours and 15 minutes of apnea after the administration of succinylcholine was attributed to a decreased rate of succinylcholine metabolism from inhibition of pseudocholinesterase by the insecticide. Only one similar case has been reported previously in the English medical literature. If succinylcholine is to be used in patients with organophosphate poisoning, a prolonged paralysis should be anticipated.
We evaluated the involvement of angiotensin II (AngII)-dependent pathways in melanoma growth, through the pharmacological blockage of AT1 receptor by the anti-hypertensive drug losartan (LOS).
We showed immunolabeling for both AngII and the AT1 receptor within the human melanoma microenvironment. Like human melanomas, we showed that murine melanomas also express the AT1 receptor. Growth of murine melanoma, both locally and at distant sites, was limited in mice treated with LOS. The reduction in tumor growth was accompanied by a twofold decrease in tumor-associated microvessel density and by a decrease in CD31 mRNA levels. While no differences were found in the VEGF expression levels in tumors from treated animals, reduction in the expression of the VEGFR1 (Flt-1) at the mRNA and protein levels was observed. We also showed downregulation of mRNA levels of both Flt-4 and its ligand, VEGF-C.
Together, these results show that blockage of AT1 receptor signaling may be a promising anti-tumor strategy, interfering with angiogenesis by decreasing the expression of angiogenic factor receptors.
Our experience with intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1 in spinal cord injured patients with neurogenic erectile dysfunction included 15 men. They received testing dosage starting from 5 micrograms with increasing dosage (maximum 20 micrograms) to achieve a rigid erection of Schramek's grade 5 and lasting for at least 20 min. All of them had achieved functional erection adequate for coitus after treatment except one patient who had been proved to have venogenic impotence. We found that intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1 had significantly improved the erectile condition. No systemic side effect or any other complication was noted except that pain at the injection site was complained of in two patients with incomplete lesion.
Indapamide--a non-thiazide diuretic agent--was given to 28 patients with mild and moderate hypertension in a daily dose of 2.5 mg for 12 weeks. Statistically significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and complete normalization of the arterial blood pressure were achieved in 82% of the treated patients. Adverse reactions were mild and transient. However, low but statistically significant decrease in blood serum potassium and changes in the carbohydrate metabolism were seen. No significant effect of the-drug on lipid metabolism was found except the low but statistically significant increase in total cholesterol. Indapamide is an efficient and well tolerated hypotensive agent. However, biochemical indices should be checked up during the treatment due to the potential adverse reactions.
Omeprazole is a new hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase antagonist with indications for severe reflux esophagitis and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Side effects involving the liver have consisted of minimal elevations of hepatocellular enzymes with higher dosages. We present what we believe is the first reported case of fulminant hepatic failure related to omeprazole.
Toxicity of environmental pollutants may be expressed as combined effects of a chemicals. Benzene, a proven hematotoxic agent, frequently occurs with toluene in cocontaminated groundwater. Groups of CD-1 male mice were exposed continuously for 4 weeks to benzene (166 mg/l), toluene (80 and 325 mg/l), and combinations of benzene (166 mg/l) + toluene (80 mg/l or 325 mg/l) in drinking water. Benzene-induced anemia was alleviated by simultaneous toluene treatment. Leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed in the case of benzene only and benzene + toluene (80 mg/l)-treated mice. The cytopenia, however, was less severe in the benzene + toluene (325 mg/l)-treated group. Immunotoxicity induced by benzene treatment alone was characterized by involution of thymic mass and suppressions of both B- and T-cell mitogeneses, mixed lymphocyte culture response to alloantigens, the tumor lytic ability of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes as determined by 51Cr-release assay, and antibody production response to T-dependent antigen (sheep red blood cells). IL-2 secretion by Con A-stimulated mouse T-cells was decreased in the benzene-treated group. Toluene (325 mg/l) completely inhibited these adverse effects when it was coadministered with benzene, while the low dose of toluene (80 mg/l) did not protect against benzene-induced depressions of immune functions. Toluene administered alone at levels up to 325 mg/l showed no obvious immunotoxic effects. Results of this study demonstrated that toluene, in sufficient amounts, has an antagonistic effect on benzene immunotoxicity.
Mutant mouse models are indispensable tools for clarifying the functions of genes and for elucidating the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases. Currently, several large-scale mutagenesis projects that employ the chemical mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) are underway worldwide. One specific aim of our ENU mutagenesis project is to generate diabetic mouse models. We screened 9375 animals for dominant traits using a clinical biochemical test and thereby identified 11 mutations in the glucokinase (Gk) gene that were associated with hyperglycemia. GK is a key regulator of insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cell. Approximately 190 heterozygous mutations in the human GK gene have been reported to cause maturity onset diabetes of the young, type 2 (MODY2). In addition, five mutations have been reported to cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) when present on both alleles. The mutations in our 11 hyperglycemic mutants are located at different positions in Gk. Four have also been found in human MODY2 patients, and another mutant bears its mutation at the same location that is mutated in a PNDM patient. Thus, ENU mutagenesis is effective for developing mouse models for various human genetic diseases, including diabetes mellitus. Some of our Gk mutant lines displayed impaired glucose-responsive insulin secretion and the mutations had different effects on Gk mRNA levels and/or the stability of the GK protein. This collection of Gk mutants will be valuable for understanding GK gene function, for dissecting the function of the enzyme and as models of human MODY2 and PNDM.
Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), affecting up to 25% of neonates and young children after cardiac surgery, contributes to postoperative morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic milrinone in pediatric patients at high risk for developing LCOS.
The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 3 parallel groups (low dose, 25- microg/kg bolus over 60 minutes followed by a 0.25- microg/kg per min infusion for 35 hours; high dose, 75- microg/kg bolus followed by a 0.75- microg/kg per min infusion for 35 hours; or placebo). The composite end point of death or the development of LCOS was evaluated at 36 hours and up to 30 days after randomization. Among 238 treated patients, 25.9%, 17.5%, and 11.7% in the placebo, low-dose milrinone, and high-dose milrinone groups, respectively, developed LCOS in the first 36 hours after surgery. High-dose milrinone significantly reduced the risk the development of LCOS compared with placebo, with a relative risk reduction of 55% (P=0.023) in 238 treated patients and 64% (P=0.007) in 227 patients without major protocol violations. There were 2 deaths, both after infusion of study drug. The use of high-dose milrinone reduced the risk of the LCOS through the final visit by 48% (P=0.049).
The use of high-dose milrinone after pediatric congenital heart surgery reduces the risk of LCOS.
The long-term efficacy of lamivudine therapy in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still not clear. In this study, 20 non-cirrhotic Japanese patients infected with HBV received lamivudine therapy for more than 1 year and were followed for a median period of 8.5 years (range, 6.7-8.7 years). The rates of HBe antigen (HbeAg) negative, HBV-DNA undetectable, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normal level at the start of lamivudine were 55%, 25%, and 20% and 85%, 80%, and were 80%, respectively, at the last visit, including patients who received additional treatment. The values at the last visit tended to and were significantly higher than those at the start. The values improved at the last visit regardless of the emergence of YMDD motif mutant and continuation of lamivudine. YMDD mutant and biochemical relapse with mutant virus (breakthrough hepatitis) appeared in 65% and 45% during follow-up, respectively, but severe breakthrough hepatitis occurred in only 5%. Furthermore, 80% of patients who received additional treatment for breakthrough hepatitis, regardless of continuation of lamivudine, were ALT normal level at the last visit, in contrast to 25% untreated. HBsAg clearance occurred in two patients of the discontinuous lamivudine group with non-vertical transmission, who were relatively young. One was infected with HBV genotype C with breakthrough hepatitis and the other had no YMDD mutant and was infected with genotype D, a rare type in Japan. None developed cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during follow-up. Our results suggest that long-term lamivudine therapy improves long-term prognosis, especially when additional treatment for breakthrough hepatitis is used.
