A 33-year old farmer ingested approximately 300 ml of a 20% solution of diquat along with about 80 mg flunitrazepam. The patient presented neurological (coma grade I), digestive (oro-pharyngeal erosions, ileus), hepatic (cytolysis), hematological (thrombopenia) and renal (tubular dysfunction) signs. Plasma creatinine did not exceed 1.22 mg/dl (upper normal value), but retinol binding protein level in urine (a marker of renal tubular dysfunction) reached a value of 337 mg/d (normal values less than 300 micrograms/d). Its level returned to normal value 18 days after the ingestion. Four hours after the poisoning, diquat level in blood amounted to 10.4 mg/l, but its level was below the detection limit (0.2 mg/l) 6 hours later. In urine, however, diquat was detected until day 13. The following therapy was applied: ventilation (FiO2:0.21), gastro-intestinal lavage, hemoperfusion, anti-oxidants and prolonged forced diuresis. The patient made an uneventful recovery. intestinal washout must be applied with caution since an ileus is a classical complication of diquat poisoning. Hemoperfusion was found to be of little value. The interest of prolonged application of forced diuresis is suggested by the detection of diquat in urine for about 2 weeks along with the presence of biological signs of renal tubular dysfunction.
Sirolimus (SRL) has been implicated in the causation of post-transplantation anaemia (PTA). It also induces profound red blood cell (RBC) microcytosis, which is poorly understood.
We conducted a retrospective study of SRL-induced anaemia and microcytosis [mean corpuscular volume (MCV) <80 fl] with specific reference to iron homeostasis in 93 renal transplant patients treated with SRL for at least 3 months.
While mean haemoglobin (Hb) and use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents increased on SRL, RBC MCV underwent a significant decline throughout the whole study period of 24 months (P < 0.001) with the percentage of microcytosis rising from 2.2% at the start of SRL therapy to 40.7% after 24 months of therapy. An association between dMCV (MCV change on SRL) and SRL levels was shown at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-SRL (P = 0.015, P = 0.037, P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively). Intravenous (IV) iron administration was an independent predictor of dMCV at 12 and 24 months on SRL (P = 0.031 and P = 0.048, respectively). All patients who, after starting SRL and seeing a fall in MCV, then went on to receive IV iron therapy, showed a marked increase in MCV; this did not happen to patients given oral iron therapy.
SRL is associated with mild anaemia, but marked RBC microcytosis-these phenomena are correlated with SRL levels and the use of IV iron. Functional iron deficiency and impaired gastrointestinal absorption of iron seem likely explanations.
Brugada syndrome (BS) is associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with a structurally normal heart. The ECG pattern of BS has also been described in patients with myocardial abnormalities. Cardiac hypersensitivity and myopericarditis have been reported during long-term treatment with mesalazine. We report the case of a man, treated with mesalazine for Crohn's disease who developed drug-induced pericarditis. The ECG showed a coved ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads V1-V3, a pattern mimicking BS. The ECG normalized in a few days after mesalazine withdrawal and the follow-up was uneventful. The ECG remained normal. Two ajmaline tests were both negative and ruled out the diagnosis of BS. This observation illustrates that a coved ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads should not be, systematically, regarded as a marker of a specific syndrome, but may also reflect a common electrical manifestation of abnormalities in the right ventricle or pericardium.
We studied the possible deleterious effect of levodopa therapy on 185 patients with Parkinson's disease and concluded that the time when levodopa is introduced, the daily dose, and the duration of treatment do not aggravate Parkinson's disease. We also studied 72 parkinsonian patients with levodopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements to see whether early initiation of levodopa therapy affected the time of onset of abnormal involuntary movements. The results suggested that it did not, and that levodopa was started early in these patients because of the severity of their motor disability.
The anticonvulsant effects of acetone have been reported in various animal models of epilepsy. We recently demonstrated that other ketone bodies, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and diethyl ketone (DEK), suppressed status epilepticus that was induced by lithium-pilocarpine in rat. In the present study, the anticonvulsant effects of MEK and DEK were evaluated by using four different types of mouse seizure models, which were induced by pentylenetetrazole, kainic acid, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), and electroshock. The effects of clonazepam, a typical anticonvulsant, and acetone were also evaluated and compared with MEK and DEK. In this study, MEK (5 and 10 mmol/kg, i.p.) and DEK (2.5 and 5 mmol/kg, i.p.) produced anticonvulsant activity against all types of seizure models. Furthermore, MEK and DEK showed almost the same potencies against four different seizure models used, while clonazepam showed significant higher ED(50) values against kainic acid-induced and electroshock-induced seizure models as compared with the pentylenetetrazole- or DMCM-induced seizure model. In each study, the highest doses of clonazepam (1 or 3mg/kg) did not show clear anticonvulsant effects against the kainic acid- or electroshock-induced seizures. In conclusion, MEK and DEK showed broad-spectra anticonvulsant effects in both chemically- and electroshock-induced experimental seizure models.
1,1, 1-trichloroéthane is derived from carbon tetrachloride and has been widely used as an industrial solvent since 1954, because of its supposed lack of toxicity. However, several cases of central nervous system toxicity and heart disorders due to intoxication by 1,1, 1-trichloroéthane have been reported. Cases of liver injury are infrequent, with less than 10 cases, unlike 1,1, 2-trichloroéthane that it replaced. We report a case of hepatotoxicity probably due to 1,1, 1-trichloroéthane exposure, characterized by an original pathologic feature of chronic active hepatitis.
Four patients developed nonthrombocytopenic purpura two to three weeks after initiation of quinidine therapy. The skin lesions disappeared and did not recur after cessation of quinidine therapy. Histologic examination revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with deposition of C3, IgA, and/or IgM in the small dermal vessels. Since quinidine purpura is usually associated with thrombocytopenia, the possibility of leukocytoclastic vasculitis as an additional cause of purpura is stressed.
MicroRNAs (miRs) are conserved small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. The miR profiles are markedly altered in cancers and some of them have a causal role in tumorigenesis. Here, we report changes in miR expression profile in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) developed in male Fisher rats-fed folic acid, methionine, and choline-deficient (FMD) diet. Comparison of the miR profile by microarray analysis showed altered expression of some miRs in hepatomas compared to the livers from age-matched rats on the normal diet. While let-7a, miR-21, miR-23, miR-130, miR-190, and miR-17-92 family of genes was upregulated, miR-122, an abundant liver-specific miR, was downregulated in the tumors. The decrease in hepatic miR-122 was a tumor-specific event because it did not occur in the rats switched to the folate and methyl-adequate diet after 36 weeks on deficient diet, which did not lead to hepatocarcinogenesis. miR-122 was also silent in a transplanted rat hepatoma. Extrapolation of this study to human primary HCCs revealed that miR-122 expression was significantly (P = 0.013) reduced in 10 out of 20 tumors compared to the pair-matched control tissues. These findings suggest that the downregulation of miR-122 is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and could be a potential biomarker for liver cancers.
Combined hepatocellular injury and renal tubular necrosis developed in five alcoholic patients who were receiving acetaminophen therapeutically. Two patients were taking doses prescribed by a physician. The hepatitis was characterized by extremely high serum transaminase values that were maximal on admission. Two patients died, and autopsy disclosed hepatic centrizonal necrosis and acute renal tubular necrosis. The three who survived had clinical features typical of acute tubular necrosis. All five had measurable concentrations of acetaminophen in plasma, although measurements were requested on admission only in two patients. When an alcoholic presents with combined hepatic and renal insufficiency, acetaminophen should be considered as a possible inciting agent. This diagnosis should be considered when serum transaminase levels are markedly elevated and when renal failure is due to acute tubular necrosis.
To characterize the lesion produced in the medulla oblongata by gold thioglucose (GTG), the present experiment quantified the medullary damage in C57B1 mice that had become obese after treatment with 800 mg/kg of GTG at 30 days of age. At the rostrocaudal level of the area postrema, the neurotoxin destroyed up to 75% of the neurons in the medial cell column of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX), while sparing the lateral pole of the nucleus. GTG also produced significant tissue loss in the central and commissural subnuclei of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST). In contrast, the GTG lesion did not affect cell number in the hypoglossal nucleus or reduce the volume of the area postrema. Additional observations indicated that at 48-72 h after GTG administration the affected regions of the medulla already show advanced necrosis including cell loss and gliosis; and when the relative contributions of hypothalamic, DMX, and NST damage to the obesity that develops are evaluated statistically with partial correlational analysis, it appears the the obesity primarily correlates with the hypothalamic lesion produced by GTG.
Diabetes mellitus has been proposed as an epidemiological risk factor for human liver cancer development. One reasonable possibility is that this is attributable to hyperinsulinemia compensatory for obesity-related insulin resistance. However, diabetes mellitus is a complex disease with multiple abnormal conditions essentially caused by hyperglycemia. Therefore, it is not evident whether hyperinsulinemia is prerequisite for the elevated cancer risk. To gain a clue to answer this question, we characterized chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis in diabetic model mice genetically deficient for insulin. Akita inbred mice originating from the C57BL/6 strain carry a heterozygous germline mutation of the insulin II gene and suffer from inherited insulin deficiency and diabetes in an autosomal dominant manner. They were mated with normal C3H/HeJ mice with high sensitivity to liver carcinogenesis and the resultant F(1) littermates, which were either normal or insulin deficient, were exposed to diethylnitrosamine and induced hepatocellular tumors were evaluated for number, size, proliferative activity, and apoptosis. Unexpectedly, both mean and total volumes of hepatocellular tumors in the insulin-deficient animals were more than twofold larger than those in the normal controls, with no significant difference in tumor number. The tumors in insulin-deficient mice showed a significantly lower frequency of apoptosis but no alteration in cell proliferation. In conclusion, our results indicate that insulin-independent liver tumor promotion occurred in diabetic mice. Clearly, insulin-independent mechanisms for the human case also deserve consideration.
Temporal lobe epilepsy is common and difficult to treat. Reduced inhibition of dentate granule cells may contribute. Basket cells are important inhibitors of granule cells. Excitatory synaptic input to basket cells and unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs) from basket cells to granule cells were evaluated in hippocampal slices from a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Basket cells were identified by electrophysiological and morphological criteria. Excitatory synaptic drive to basket cells, measured by mean charge transfer and frequency of miniature EPSCs, was significantly reduced after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and remained low in epileptic rats, despite mossy fiber sprouting. Paired recordings revealed higher failure rates and a trend toward lower amplitude uIPSCs at basket cell-to-granule cell synapses in epileptic rats. Higher failure rates were not attributable to excessive presynaptic inhibition of GABA release by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine or GABA(B) receptors. High-frequency trains of action potentials in basket cells generated uIPSCs in granule cells to evaluate readily releasable pool (RRP) size and resupply rate of recycling vesicles. Recycling rate was similar in control and epileptic rats. However, quantal size at basket cell-to-granule cell synapses was larger and RRP size smaller in epileptic rats. Therefore, in epileptic animals, basket cells receive less excitatory synaptic drive, their pools of readily releasable vesicles are smaller, and transmission failure at basket cell-to-granule cell synapses is increased. These findings suggest dysfunction of the dentate basket cell circuit could contribute to hyperexcitability and seizures.
Although 2,3,5-tris-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (TGHQ; 2.5 micromol/kg ip) markedly increased cell proliferation within the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OSOM) of the kidney in both wild-type (Tsc2(+/+)) and mutant Eker rats (Tsc2(EK/+)), only TGHQ-treated Tsc2(EK/+) rats developed renal tumors, indicating that cell proliferation per se was not sufficient for tumor development. Tuberin expression was initially induced within the OSOM after TGHQ treatment but was lost within TGHQ-induced renal tumors. High extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity occurred in the OSOM of Tsc2(EK/+) rats at 4 mo and in TGHQ-induced renal tumors. Cyclin D1 was also highly expressed in TGHQ-induced renal tumors. Reexpression of Tsc2 in tuberin-negative cells decreased ERK activity, consistent with the growth-suppressive effects of this tumor suppressor gene. Thus 1) stimulation of cell proliferation after toxicant insult is insufficient for tumor formation; 2) tuberin induction after acute tissue injury suggests that Tsc2 is an acute-phase response gene, limiting the proliferative response after injury; and 3) loss of Tsc2 gene function is associated with cell cycle deregulation.
Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are stable perfluoroalkyl sulfonate (PFAS) surfactants, and PFHxS and PFOS are frequently detected in human biomonitoring studies. Some epidemiological studies have shown modest positive correlations of serum PFOS with non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (C). This study investigated the mechanism underlying the effect of PFAS surfactants on lipoprotein metabolism. APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice were fed a Western-type diet with PFBS, PFHxS, or PFOS (30, 6, and 3 mg/kg/day, respectively) for 4-6 weeks. Whereas PFBS modestly reduced only plasma triglycerides (TG), PFHxS and PFOS markedly reduced TG, non-HDL-C, and HDL-C. The decrease in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) was caused by enhanced lipoprotein lipase-mediated VLDL-TG clearance and by decreased production of VLDL-TG and VLDL-apolipoprotein B. Reduced HDL production, related to decreased apolipoprotein AI synthesis, resulted in decreased HDL. PFHxS and PFOS increased liver weight and hepatic TG content. Hepatic gene expression profiling data indicated that these effects were the combined result of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and pregnane X receptor activation. In conclusion, the potency of PFAS to affect lipoprotein metabolism increased with increasing alkyl chain length. PFHxS and PFOS reduce plasma TG and total cholesterol mainly by impairing lipoprotein production, implying that the reported positive correlations of serum PFOS and non-HDL-C are associative rather than causal.
Synthetic gestagens, including levonorgestrel (LNG), are active compounds in contraceptives, and several studies report their occurrence in surface waters. However, information about endocrine-disrupting effects in nontarget organisms is scarce. The present study investigated effects of LNG exposure on thyroid hormone-dependent metamorphosis of Xenopus laevis. Premetamorphic X. laevis tadpoles at Nieuwkoop and Faber (NF) stage 48 were exposed in a flow-through culture system to four LNG concentrations (10(-11), 10(-10), 10(-9), and 10(-8)M) over the period of metamorphosis. At NF 58 and 66, tadpoles were examined sex specifically. Developmental time and organismal responses were recorded and correlated with molecular and histopathological endpoints. Exposure to 10(-8)M LNG caused an inhibition of metamorphosis resulting in developmental arrest at early climax stages as giant tadpoles or tailed frogs. In brain-pituitary tissue of NF 58 tadpoles, gene expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (β-subunit; TSHβ), TH receptor β (TRβ), and deiodinase type 3 (D3) was not changed. Instead, prolactin (PRL) messenger RNA (mRNA) was significantly increased by 10(-9)M LNG in females and by 10(-8)M LNG in both sexes. In NF 66 tadpoles, mRNA levels of TSHβ mRNA were significantly increased in the 10(-9) and 10(-8)M LNG treatment groups indicating a hypothyroid state. No changes of TRβ, D3, and PRL gene expression were detected. Histopathological evaluation of thyroid gland sections revealed no typical sign of hypothyroidism but rather an inactivated appearance of the thyroid. In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time a completely new aspect of thyroid system disruption caused by synthetic gestagens in developing amphibians.
To evaluate the variables affecting orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) outcome for hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a large patient cohort over a 17-year period.
Historically, OLT for chronic HBV infection has been associated with aggressive reinfection and poor survival results. More recently, OLT outcome has been improved with the routine use of antiviral therapy with either hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) or lamivudine; however, HBV recurrence remains common. The authors studied the factors affecting HBV recurrence and outcome of transplantation, including the effects of combination viral prophylaxis with HBIg and lamivudine.
A retrospective review of 166 OLT recipients for chronic HBV over a 17-year period at a single center was performed. Median follow-up was 29 months. HBV recurrence was defined by HBsAg seropositivity after OLT. HBIg monotherapy was used in 28 (17%) patients, lamivudine monotherapy in 20 (12%), and HBIg and lamivudine combination in 89 (54%); 29 (17%) did not receive any HBV prophylaxis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was present in 43 patients (26%) and urgent United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status was assigned to 27 patients (16%). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors that affected OLT outcome.
Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year patient survival rates were 85.8%, 73.6%, and 71.8%, respectively. As expected, HBV recurrence-free survival rates were significantly lower than overall survival rates (76.4%, 58.7%, and 48.3%). When compared with a nontreated cohort, OLT recipients receiving combination viral prophylaxis with HBIg and lamivudine showed markedly reduced HBV recurrence rates and significantly improved 1- and 3-year recurrence-free survival rates. By univariate estimates, patient survival was reduced in the presence of HCC, in the Asian population, and urgent candidates by UNOS classification. Graft loss rates were significantly increased in urgent OLT candidates, Asians, patients with pretransplant positive DNA, and in the presence of HCC. Factors that were significant by univariate analysis or thought to be clinically relevant were subjected to multivariate analysis. By multivariate estimates, urgent UNOS or presence of HCC adversely affected patient and graft survival rates, whereas combination prophylactic therapy strongly predicted improved patient and graft survival rates as well as recurrence-free survival rates.
Orthotopic liver transplantation for HBV under combination viral prophylaxis results in survival rates equivalent to other indications. Pretransplant viral replication, UNOS status, and the presence of HCC are all sensitive markers for posttransplantation outcome. Viral prophylactic therapy has effectively reduced HBV recurrence and prolonged survival outcomes. The combination of HBIg and lamivudine is the prophylactic regimen of choice.
Lithium carbonate has been recognized to induce several renal side effects, including the nephrotic syndrome. This is a report of an 11-year-old, prepubertal boy with a mood disorder treated with lithium who presented with edema, bilateral pulmonary effusions, proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia. Renal biopsy revealed pathologic changes consistent with minimal change disease. These symptoms normalized after lithium discontinuation.
The presence of inappropriate sexual behaviors in individuals with autistic disorder is one of the important factors disturbing their social adaptation and distressing their families and environment. Therefore, appropriate management of these behaviors seems necessary. This case report describes a 13-year-old male with diagnosis of autistic disorder and fetishistic behavior. His fetishistic behavior was treated successfully using mirtazapine 15 mg/day. The clinical picture and efficacy of mirtazapine will be discussed.
The high prevalence of anger, impulsivity and violence in cocaine addiction implicates chronic cocaine use in the compromise of higher-order inhibitory control neurocognitive processes. We used the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) anger content scale as a personality measure of inhibitory control and examined its association with glucose metabolism in the lateral orbitofrontal gyrus (LOFG) at rest as measured by positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (PET (18)FDG) in 17 recently abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects and 16 comparison subjects. Three additional variables--the MMPI-2 depression content scale, metabolism in the medial orbitofrontal gyrus (MOFG) and the anterior cingulate (AC) gyrus--were inspected. When level of education was statistically controlled for, the LOFG was significantly associated with anger within the cocaine group. No other region was associated with anger within the cocaine-dependent group, and the LOFG did not correlate with depression within any of the study groups. The present study confirms earlier reports in demonstrating a positive association between relative metabolism at rest in the LOFG and cognitive-behavioral and personality measures of inhibitory control in drug addiction: the higher the metabolism, the better the inhibitory control.
Nephrotoxicity related to vancomycin hydrochloride therapy has been reported at overall rates of 7% to 16% and as high as 35% when combined with an aminoglycoside antibiotic. We conducted a prospective study in older men. A group that received vancomycin was compared with a control group to determine the incidence of nephrotoxicity secondary to vancomycin therapy alone and in combination with aminoglycosides, to identify possible risk factors associated with nephrotoxicity, and to determine the incidence of other adverse effects associated with vancomycin use. Nephrotoxicity occurred in 11 (17%) of 66 patients receiving vancomycin and in 3 (5%) of 57 controls overall. Stepwise logistic-regression analysis failed to identify underlying illnesses or concurrent risks that may have contributed to the development of nephrotoxicity associated with vancomycin. Adverse effects, including phlebitis (14%), neutropenia (1%), rash (0%), and red neck syndrome (0%), occurred at rates similar to previous reports.
A patient with focal epilepsy that was resistant to medical treatment received add-on therapy with vigabatrin. Six months after commencement of vigabatrin therapy, allergic vasculitis caused by vigabatrin was diagnosed. The patient displayed unilateral anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy with impairment of vision and concentric loss of visual field. The diagnosis was based on the lymphocyte transformation test and the clinical course. The allergic vasculitis was healed by cortisone therapy.
Sialadenitis is an uncommon side effect of phenylbutazone, and we report seven patients with this reaction who were admitted to Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital over a seven year period. In addition to salivary gland swellings, all patients had evidence of a systemic disturbance that included fever in all cases, and, in varying combinations, pericarditis, pleurisy, rash, conjunctivitis, and disturbed hepatic function. Resolution of these features occurred following cessation of phenylbutazone, but this took several weeks in some cases. Pericarditis was the most severe manifestation, and in one patient, this required corticosteroid therapy.
In certain situations, health problems can arise if physicians are not aware of over-the-counter medications and vitamins a patient may be taking in addition to their regular prescriptions. Since many people do not consider OTC drugs to be medications, they often do not relay this information while discussing their medical histories. This article describes how the symptoms of soft tissue rheumatism can become worse if patients ingest an excess amount of vitamin A.
Furan is a heterocyclic organic compound formed during heat treatment for processing and preservation of various types of food. Rodent studies have previously shown that furan is a hepatocarcinogen. Those studies were conducted over a high dose range, which induced tumors at nearly 100% incidence at all doses. This ninety-day gavage study in mice was conducted to extend the dose to a lower range (0.0, 0.03, 0.12, 0.5, 2.0, and 8.0 mg/kg body weight [bw] per day) to identify a no-observed adverse effect level for hepatotoxicity and to characterize non-neoplastic effects, including those affecting clinical biochemistry, hematology, tissue morphology, and histopathology. The liver was the primary target organ with dose-dependent toxicity. Liver weights were increased at the 8.0 mg/kg bw dose in females only. Levels of the serum enzyme alanine transaminase, representative of liver damage, were increased three-fold at the highest dose. Histological changes in the liver were observed at 2.0 and 8.0 mg/kg bw in both sexes. Although clinical parameters were also altered for the kidney, these differences were not accompanied by histological changes. Based on these clinical biochemical and histological changes, a no-observed adverse effect level of 0.12 mg/kg bw per day of furan in mice is suggested.
The carcinogenic potential of chloroform was evaluated in a short-term carcinogenicity testing system using CB6F1 rasH2-Tg (rasH2-Tg) mice. Chloroform was administered to rasH2-Tg males at doses of 28, 90, or 140 mg/kg and rasH2-Tg females at 24, 90, or 240 mg/kg by oral gavage for 26 weeks. Wild-type (non-Tg) male and female mice received doses of 140 mg/kg and 240 mg/kg, respectively. N-methyl-N-nitrosourea was administered to rasH2-Tg mice by single intraperitoneal injection (75 mg/kg) as a positive control. In both the rasH2-Tg and non-Tg mice, there was no significant increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions by chloroform treatment. The incidence of hepatocellular foci in the rasH2- and non-Tg females receiving 240 mg/kg was increased. Forestomach tumors and malignant tumors occurred in most of the rasH2-mice in the positive control group. Swelling or vacuolation of hepatocytes, a toxic change induced by chloroform, occurred in both the rasH2-Tg and non-Tg mice. It is concluded that chloroform, a putative human noncarcinogen, did not show evidence of carcinogenic potential in the present study using rasH2-Tg mice. This study suggests that the rasH2-Tg mouse model may not be appropriate for detecting nongenotoxic carcinogens. However, the sensitivity of rasH2-Tg mice to nongenotoxic carcinogens should be assessed with consideration of the results from the other ILSI-HESI project studies.
A total of 8000 anesthesias with ketamine or ketamine + halothane in children with infantile cerebral paralysis, operated in a one-day hospital, are analyzed. The complications were as follows: tachycardias in 12%, hypotonia in 8%, repeated vomiting in 5%, postnarcosis depression in 10%, psychomotor excitation in 9%, and painful syndrome in 7%. The most incident combination of complications was hypotonia, tachycardia, repeated vomiting, and postnarcosis depression. Complications occurred in 14.2% cases in ketamine anesthesia and in 4.3% cases in halothane + ketamine anesthesia.
