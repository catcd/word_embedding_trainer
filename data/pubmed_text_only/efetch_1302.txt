Phentolamine mesylate, at dosages from 0.4 to 0.8 mg in adults and adolescents and at dosages from 0.2 to 0.4 mg in children aged 4 to 11 years, has been proven to be safe and effective for the reversal of soft tissue anesthesia (lip and tongue numbness) and the associated functional deficits resulting from a local dental anesthetic injection containing a vasoconstrictor. Its ability to block a-adrenergic receptors on blood vessels induces vasodilation and enhances the redistribution of the local anesthetic away from the injection site. The low dosages administered for dental local anesthetic reversal in all likelihood accounts for the lack of significant cardiovascular effects that are associated with the medical use of the drug for hypertensive conditions associated with catecholamine excess.
We present a case of long-term trihexyphenidyl (THP) abuse in which memory and cognitive impairments were observed 23 years after the commencement of medication. This case showed a dramatic improvement after withdrawal of THP. Clinical course during admission was followed with psychometric testing and laboratory examinations. The fact that the patient showed no evidence of lowered alertness during the clinical course raises the possibility that THP can primarily induce impairment of memory and cognitive functions. This is supported by the findings on the resting EEG of the patient. This case emphasizes the need to exercise caution in prescribing high doses of anticholinergic agents for long periods, particularly in elderly patients with underlying brain pathology.
In The Netherlands, an increasing number of people use cocaine frequently, which may induce orofacial complications such as perforation of the nasal septum and palate, gingival lesions and dental erosion. In addition, recent use of cocaine increases the risk of cardiovascular complications during dental treatment, especially when local anaesthetics or adrenaline-impregnated retraction cords are used. Therefore, dental treatment should be postponed at least 6 to 24 hours after the use of cocaine.
Epidural volume extension (EVE) with saline solution can contribute to greater cephalad spread of drugs injected into the subarachnoid space during cesarean section. We studied the incidence of material hypotension with spinal bupivacaine or levobupivacaine (L-bupivacaine) and the spread after epidural saline injection.
After ethics committee approval, we randomized women scheduled for cesarean section to 4 groups to receive 5 mg of 0.25% bupivacaine with (n=51) or without (n=6) saline EVE; 5 mg of 025% L-bupivacaine (n=50); or 6 mg of 03% L-bupivacaine (n=50). All patients also received 25 microg of fentanyl per 2 mL of local hyperbaric spinal anesthetic. In all except the non-EVE group, 10 mL of saline was infused through an epidural catheter 5 minutes after anesthetic infusion. We recorded patient demographic data, procedural and anesthetic times, incision-clamping times, occurrence of hypotension, ephedrine dose required, motor and sensory blockade, requirement for rescue analgesics, and neonatal outcome.
After 6 patients had been randomized to the non-EVE group, no further patients were assigned because all the women required rescue analgesics. Demographic data, duration of procedure, time between. incision and delivery, and Apgar scores were similar in all the groups. The incidence of hypotension was lower in the group receiving 5 mg of L-bupivacaine (26% vs. 52.9% in the bupivacaine 5-mg group, and 56% in the 6-mg L-bupivacaine group, P = .04). More women given 5 mg of L-bupivacaine required rescue analgesia (46%) than did those receiving 5 mg of bupivacaine (235%) or 6 mg of L-bupivacaine (28%) (P = .039). Hypotension was associated with a lower umbilical cord pH (P = .001). Ephedrine doses over 20 mg were also associated with a lower umbilical cord pH (P = .031).
The incidence of hypotension was lowest in the group anesthetized with 5 mg of L-bupivacaine, but the need for rescue analgesia was greater in this group. Doses of 5 mg and 6 mg may be sufficient for cesarean section, as they provide a good level of sensory blockade.
Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a secreted protein of the angiopoietin-like family, is induced by hypoxia in both tumor and endothelial cells as well as in hypoxic perinecrotic areas of numerous cancers. Here, we investigated whether ANGPTL4 might affect tumor growth as well as metastasis. Metastatic 3LL cells were therefore xenografted into control mice and mice in which ANGPTL4 was expressed by using in vivo DNA electrotransfer. Whereas primary tumors grew at a similar rate in both groups, 3LL cells metastasized less efficiently to the lungs of mice that expressed ANGPTL4. Fewer 3LL emboli were observed in primary tumors, suggesting that intravasation of 3LL cells was inhibited by ANGPTL4. Furthermore, melanoma B16F0 cells injected into the retro-orbital sinus also metastasized less efficiently in mice expressing ANGPTL4. Although B16F0 cells were observed in lung vessels, they rarely invaded the parenchyma, suggesting that ANGPTL4 affects extravasation. In addition, recombinant B16F0 cells that overexpress ANGPTL4 were generated, showing a lower capacity for in vitro migration, invasion, and adhesion than control cells. Expression of ANGPTL4 induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through inhibition of actin stress fiber formation and vinculin localization at focal contacts. Together, these results show that ANGPTL4, through its action on both vascular and tumor compartments, prevents the metastatic process by inhibiting vascular activity as well as tumor cell motility and invasiveness.
The poor prognosis for patients with metastatic osteosarcoma (OS) indicates that new therapeutic options should be explored. Studies with adenoviral-mediated p53 gene transfer have been conducted in many cancer types including cervical, ovarian, prostatic and head and neck tumors. However, limited work has been carried out with pediatric cancers, including OS. Using three viral constructs containing cDNA for wild-type p53, mutant p53 (Cys135Ser) and lacZ, we studied the effect of adenoviral-mediated gene therapy in four OS cell lines: Saos-2 (p53-/-), HOS (R156P), KHOS/NP (R156P) and MNNG (R156P, F270L). We demonstrated that the virus efficiently enters the cells using the beta-galactosidase assay. Using the MTT assay, we have shown a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability 72 h post-treatment that occurs with Ad-wtp53 but not with Ad-mutp53. We have also shown that treatment with Ad-wtp53 significantly increases sensitivity of the cell lines to cisplatin and doxorubicin, chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the treatment of OS. Our results indicate that restoration of wt p53 function in OS cells provides a basis for novel approaches to treatment of this disease.
The purpose of the analysis described here was to classify not-in-treatment drug users participating in the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-sponsored Cooperative Agreement study into several "homogeneous" HIV risk groups using cluster analysis. Data for this analysis (N=17,778) were collected at 19 study sites in the United States and Puerto Rico. Measures selected for the cluster analysis were limited to (a) current drug use and HIV risk behaviors, (b) mutually exclusive behaviors, (c) behaviors directly related to HIV risk, and (d) behaviors that were not statistically rare. Eight homogeneous HIV risk clusters were produced. Crack cocaine use was the most distinguishing feature of three clusters. Another three clusters were distinguishable by drug injection and needle use practices. Two additional clusters could not be grouped with either the crack- or the injection-dominant clusters. Prostitution was the most distinguishing risk behavior of one of these clusters, and extremely high drug injection frequencies and relative rates of risky needle use characterized the other. Composition of the clusters varied significantly by gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and drug use characteristics. In addition, perceptions and behaviors initiated to reduce the chances of becoming infected with HIV varied by cluster. Subjects in the crack-predominant clusters reported low perceptions of the chances of getting AIDS. Perceptions of the chances of becoming infected with HIV among subjects in the injection-predominant clusters were strongly related to injection frequency. Seroprevalence was also related to cluster. Higher rates of HIV infection were evident among the injection-predominant clusters, and higher rates were related to frequency of injection and the rate of risky needle use. Among the crack-predominant clusters, the relationship between drug use and sexual behaviors and HIV infection was less clear.
The research described here is based on a sample of 8,241 out-of-drug-treatment users of injected drugs and/or crack, aged 18 or older, recruited from 22 sites across the United States and Puerto Rico. The study divided respondents into three groups-(a) cocaine or crack users who did not also use heroin or speedball (cocaine-only users), (b) heroin injectors who did not also use cocaine or crack or speedball (heroin injectors), and (c) users of cocaine or crack and injected heroin or speedball (dual users)--and compared the efficacy of entering drug treatment for these groups' involvement in HIV-related risk behaviors. The study found that entry into treatment corresponded to greater reductions in substance abusers' frequency of drug use and involvement in risky injection practices compared to those observed in people who did not enter treatment between their baseline and 6-month follow-up interviews. Entry into drug treatment was also associated with reductions in the practice of risky sexual behaviors, but these reductions were less substantial and less consistent than those noted for drug use and injection risk behaviors.
Direct blockade of the delayed rectifier repolarising potassium current is the major underlying mechanism of drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Indapamide is a well known blocker of the slow component of the delayed rectifier current leading to prolongation of cardiac repolarization. The case of an acquired long QT and torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia in a woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension receiving prednisolone and indapamide, respectively, is described in the present report.
Nimodipine, a calcium entry blocking agent similar in structure to nifedipine but with selective cerebrovascular dilating effects, has potential use in the therapy and prevention of cerebral vasospasm after intracranial hemorrhage. The authors summarize the effects of calcium entry blockers, review the pharmacology of nimodipine, and discuss both the known and possible interactions of oral nimodipine with physical and pharmacological interventions that neuroanesthesiologists employ for patients with cerebral vasospasm during craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. In a series of 26 patients undergoing aneurysm clipping, the authors found that intraoperative blood pressure tended to be reduced by nimodipine. Although the number of patients was limited by the fact that they were enrolled in a multi-center nimodipine aneurysm study and thus had to meet the criteria for that study, it is concluded that prophylaxis of cerebral vasospasm with nimodipine in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysm results only in a favorable tendency toward lower systemic blood pressure during craniotomy.
We report the selective antimetastatic properties of 3-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydroisoxazole in the murine transplantable tumor model Lewis lung carcinoma. The compound verifies a previous study on the correlation of antimetastatic, antitumor and cytotoxic properties of aryl- and heteroaryltriazenes with their Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry (EI-MS) behavior. The new analog of dacarbazine exhibits a selective antimetastatic activity accompanied by limited thymus toxicity. The mechanism of action is unclear nevertheless any antiproliferative or cytotoxic effect is excluded.
Cigarette smoking is linked to thromboembolic events; however, a relationship between nicotine exposition and thrombosis has not been established. Thus, we intended to study the effect of acute and chronic nicotine application in an in vivo mouse model.
In microvessels of the dorsal skin fold chamber, light-dye-induced thrombus formation was analyzed using intravital fluorescence microscopy. Male and female C57BL/6J mice received nicotine chronically via the drinking water (100 microg/ml) for 8 weeks. An additional series of experiments was performed with acute iv nicotine treatment (3 mg/kg body weight).
No significant differences in microvascular thrombus formation were detected after chronic nicotine application in male and female animals when compared with controls. Accordingly, flow cytometric analysis did not show significant effects on platelet activity. Chronic nicotine treatment resulted in a significantly reduced endothelial activation in male, but not in female mice. In contrast, acute iv application of nicotine revealed significantly shorter thrombosis times in arterioles of female mice and a significantly increased endothelial P-selectin expression in mice of both genders.
Chronic nicotine application does not promote microvascular thrombus formation in mice of either gender, whereas acute high-dose iv administration caused a significant increase of arteriolar thrombosis in female animals probably via a synergistic effect of increased endothelial P-selectin expression and female hormone levels. A gender-dependency of acute nicotine action can be presumed.
To study the protective effect of Buyanghuanwu Decoction on myocardial ischemia induced by isoproterenol in rats.
Buyanghuanwu Decoction was given in different dose and the rat model of myocardial ischemia was established by peritoneal injection of isoproterenol. The expression of CD40 in whole blood was detected by flow cytometry,and the expression of CD40L in myocardial tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in blood serum were detected by biochemistry detector.
Compared with the model group, Buyanghuanwu Decoction in high and middle dose significantly inhibited the expression of CD40 in blood serum and CD40L in myocardial tissues (P < 0.01), and obviously decreased the activities of LDH, CK and AST in blood serum (P < 0.01).
Buyanghuanwu Decoction has a protective effect on myocardial ischemia induced by isoproterenol in rats, and it may be relevant to the decrease of the expression of CD40-CD40L and the activities of myocardial enzymes.
Histamine can induce coronary vasospasm, leading to variant angina and acute myocardial infarction. However, the role of histamine in thrombus formation is ill defined. Hence, this study investigates whether histamine induces tissue factor (TF) expression in vascular cells.
Histamine (10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/L) induced TF expression in a concentration-dependent manner in human aortic endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas TF pathway inhibitor expression remained unaffected. RT-PCR and Northern blotting revealed that histamine stimulated TF mRNA transcription, peaking at 1 hour. Protein expression increased 18-fold (P<0.02) with a maximum at 5 hours, which was paralleled by a 4-fold augmentation in surface activity (P<0.01). These effects were completely prevented by pretreatment with the H1 receptor antagonists mepyramine (P<0.0001), chlorpheniramine, and diphenhydramine but not the H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (P=NS). Histamine induced a time-dependent, H1 receptor-mediated activation of p38 MAP kinase (p38), p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK), and c-jun terminal NH2 kinase (JNK). Blocking of p38, ERK, or JNK with SB203580 (P<0.0001), PD98059 (P<0.0001), or SP600125 (P<0.0001), respectively, impaired histamine-induced TF expression in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, histamine-stimulated TF expression was increased by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition with LY294002 or wortmannin, whereas it was not affected by Rho-kinase inhibition with Y-27632 or hydroxyfasudil.
Histamine induces expression of TF, but not TF pathway inhibitor, in vascular cells via activation of the H1, but not H2, receptor. This effect is mediated by the MAP kinases p38, ERK, and JNK. This observation may open novel perspectives in the treatment of variant angina and acute coronary syndromes.
Determining whether environmental estrogens are associated with the risk of prostate cancer may have important implications for our general understanding of this disease. The estrogenic insecticide chlordecone was used extensively in the French West Indies, contaminating the population for more than 30 years. We analyzed the relationship between exposure to chlordecone and the risk of prostate cancer.
We investigated 623 men with prostate cancer and 671 controls. Exposure was analyzed according to case-control status, using either current plasma concentration or a cumulative exposure index based on years of exposure. We genotyped two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3829125 and rs17134592) in the gene encoding chlordecone reductase.
We found a significant increase in the risk of prostate cancer with increasing plasma chlordecone concentration (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.58 for the highest tertile of values above the limit of detection [LD]; P trend = .002) and for cumulative exposure index (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.88 for the highest quartile; P trend = .004). Stronger associations were observed among those with a positive family history of prostate cancer and among those who had lived in a Western country. The rs3829125 and rs17134592 allele variants were in complete linkage disequilibrium and were found at low frequency (0.04). Among subjects with plasma chlordecone concentrations above the LD, carriers of the allele variants had a higher risk of prostate cancer (OR, 5.23; 95% CI, 0.82 to 33.32).
These findings support the hypothesis that exposure to environmental estrogens increases the risk of prostate cancer.
1,2-Dichloropropane (1,2-DCP) has recently been reclassified from not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3) to carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This was based on the findings of epidemiological studies in Japan that occupational exposure to paint stripers containing 1,2-DCP was associated with increased cholangiocarcinomas. It is known that 1,2-DCP is negative for cholangiocarcinogenicity in rats and mice. However, its toxicity and carcinogenicity has not been examined in hamsters and little is known about the regulation of its metabolism in hamsters. The purpose of this study was to determine the hepatobiliary toxicity of 1,2-DCP in hamsters and to characterize and compare the altered patterns of hepatic xenometabolic enzymes in hamsters and mice. Male Syrian hamsters and male B6C3F1 mice were treated with various doses of 1,2-DCP for 4 h or 3 days or 4 weeks. These experiments demonstrated that a high dose of 1,2-DCP induced centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis in hamsters. CYP2E1 is possibly the key enzyme responsible for bioactivation and the consequent hepatocytotoxicity of 1,2-DCP, and GSH conjugation catalyzed by GST-T1 may exert a cytoprotective role in hamsters and mice. Notably, the expression pattern of GST-T1 in bile duct epithelial cells differed between hamsters and mice: GST-T1 was expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of mice but not hamsters. This indicates that responses to 1,2-DCP in the bile duct of hamsters might differ from that of mice, and suggests that long-term studies are necessary to clarify the chalangiocarcinogenicity of 1,2-DCP in hamsters, though no biliary toxicity was observed in the present short-term experiments.
Resveratrol (RES), an estrogen analog, is considered as a potential cancer chemo-preventive agent. However, it remains unclear how RES is transported into cells. In this study, we observed that Caveolin-1(CAV1) expression can increase the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity of RES in a dose- and time-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo in a Hepatocellular Carcinoma animal model.
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated that RES intra-cellular concentration is increased about 2-fold in cells stably expressing CAV1 or CAVM1 (a scaffolding domain (81-101AA)-defective CAV1 mutant) compared to the untransduced human Hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) or after transduction with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) control vector. The increased intra-cellular transport of RES was abolished in cells stably expressing CAVM2 (a cholesterol shuttle domain (143-156AA)-defective CAV1 mutant) or CAVRNAi. In order to further characterize CAV1-dependent RES transport, we synthesized RES-dansyl chloride derivatives as fluorescent probes to visualize the transport process, which demonstrated a distribution consistent with that of CAV1 in HepG2 cells.
In addition, RES endocytosis was not mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta, as suggested by lack of competitive inhibition by estrogen or Tamoxifen. Pathway analysis showed that RES can up-regulate the expression of endogenous CAV1; this activates further the MAPK pathway and caspase-3 expression.
This study provides novel insights about the role played by CAV1 in modulating cellular sensitivity to RES through enhancement of its internalization and trafficking.
The locomotor stimulating effect of d-amphetamine in mice was counteracted by the administration of l-naloxone [(-)-naloxone], a known opiate receptor antagonist. Mice injected with amphetamine reached a peak locomotor activity within 30 min. When treated simultaneously with amphetamine and l-naloxone, these subjects showed low motility. Furthermore, when mice were treated not with l-naloxone but with its mirror image, d-naloxone [(+)-naloxone], a compound that by itself does not antagonize opiates and does not affect spontaneous motility, they showed no amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. The finding that an enantiomer of naloxone, with no opiate antagonist activity, is able to block the excitatory action of amphetamine, suggests the existence of a hitherto unknown mechanism of counteracting some of the effects of stimulants and euphoriants like amphetamine and cocaine.
Progress in the understanding of susceptibility factors to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and outcome predictability are hampered by the lack of systematic programs to detect bona fide cases.
A cooperative network was created in 1994 in Spain to identify all suspicions of DILI following a prospective structured report form. The liver damage was characterized according to hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed laboratory criteria and to histologic criteria when available. Further evaluation of causality assessment was centrally performed.
Since April 1994 to August 2004, 461 out of 570 submitted cases, involving 505 drugs, were deemed to be related to DILI. The antiinfective group of drugs was the more frequently incriminated, amoxicillin-clavulanate accounting for the 12.8% of the whole series. The hepatocellular pattern of damage was the most common (58%), was inversely correlated with age (P < .0001), and had the worst outcome (Cox regression, P < .034). Indeed, the incidence of liver transplantation and death in this group was 11.7% if patients had jaundice at presentation, whereas the corresponding figure was 3.8% in nonjaundiced patients (P < .04). Factors associated with the development of fulminant hepatic failure were female sex (OR = 25; 95% CI: 4.1-151; P < .0001), hepatocellular damage (OR = 7.9; 95% CI: 1.6-37; P < .009), and higher baseline plasma bilirubin value (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.22; P < .0001).
Patients with drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice have 11.7% chance of progressing to death or transplantation. Amoxicillin-clavulanate stands out as the most common drug related to DILI.
In the traditional system of medicine, the roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza glabra have been employed clinically for centuries for their anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, expectorant, antimicrobial, and anxiolytic activities. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of G. glabra, popularly known as liquorice (Mulathi), on learning and memory. The elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance paradigm were employed to evaluate learning and memory parameters. Three doses (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg p.o.) of aqueous extract of G. glabra were administered for 7 successive days in separate groups of mice. The dose of 150 mg/kg of the aqueous extract of liquorice significantly improved learning and memory of mice. Furthermore, this dose reversed the amnesia induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p.), scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg i.p.), and ethanol (1 g/kg i.p.). Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of liquorice may be contributing favorably to the memory enhancement effect. Since scopolamine-induced amnesia was reversed by liquorice, it is possible that the beneficial effect on learning and memory may be because of facilitation of cholinergic transmission in brain. However, further studies are necessitated to identify the exact mechanism of action. In the present investigation, G. glabra has shown promise as a memory enhancer in both exteroceptive and interoceptive behavioral models of memory.
The increased use of flammable plastics and electronic devices along with stricter fire safety standards has led to the heavy use of flame retardant chemicals in many consumer, commercial, and industrial products. Although flame retardant use has increased, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds their safety with some evidence showing toxicity and risk to human and environmental health. Recent efforts have focused on designing high-throughput biological platforms with nonmammalian models to evaluate and prioritize chemicals with limited hazard information. To complement these efforts, this study used a new morphological and behavioral testing platform with embryonic zebrafish to characterize the developmental toxicity of 44 halogenated and organophosphate flame retardants, including several of their known metabolites. Zebrafish were exposed to flame retardants from 6 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf) across concentrations spanning 4 orders of magnitude (eg, 6.4 nM to 64 µM). Flame retardant effects on survival and development were evaluated at 24 and 120 hpf, and neurobehavioral changes were measured using 2 photomotor response (PMR) assays. Compared to controls, 93% (41/44) of flame retardants studied elicited adverse effects among one or more of the bioassays and concentrations tested with the aryl phosphate ester (APE)-based mono-isopropylated triaryl phosphate and the brominated-bisphenol-A analog tetrabromobisphenol-A producing the greatest array of malformations. Hierarchical clustering showed that APE flame retardants with isopropyl, butyl, and cresyl substituents on phenyl rings clustered tightly and were particularly potent. Both PMR assays were highly predictive of morphological defects supporting their use as nonlethal means of evaluating teratogenicity that could allow for additional evaluations of long-term or delayed effects in older animals. Taken together, evidence presented here indicates that zebrafish neurodevelopment is highly sensitive to many flame retardants currently in use and can be used to understand potential vulnerabilities to human health.
Hepatitis developed in five patients who were taking low dosages (3 g/day or less) of time-release niacin. In four of the five patients, clinical symptoms of hepatitis developed after the medication had been taken for a relatively short time (2 days to 7 weeks). This manifestation of hepatotoxicity seems to differ from that previously reported in association with use of crystalline niacin, which occurred with high dosage and prolonged usage of the medication. In view of the recent increased frequency of prescribing niacin for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, physicians should be aware of the potential for hepatotoxicity with even low-dose and short-term use of time-release niacin.
We report the molecular defect in an individual with homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia. A unique TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism was found in the midportion of the apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene using the genomic probe, pB51. The probe, which identifies TaqI fragments of 8.4 and 2.8 kilobases (kb) in normal individuals, hybridized to a single 11-kb fragment in the proband. The parents of the proband showed all three TaqI fragments, implying that they are heterozygotes for the mutant apoB allele. In this family, the mutant allele cosegregated with low total cholesterol levels and formal linkage analysis gave a decimal logarithm of the ratio score of 3.3 at a recombination frequency of 0. The polymorphic TaqI site was localized to an EcoRI fragment of 4 kb in normal individuals. The corresponding fragment in the proband was 3.4 kb, suggesting a 0.6-kb deletion in the mutant allele. Both the normal 4-kb EcoRI fragment and the mutant 3.4-kb EcoRI fragment were cloned and sequenced. In the normal allele, the 4-kb EcoRI fragment extends from intron 20 to 23. Exon 21 is flanked by Alu sequences that are in the same orientation. The mutant allele had a 694-bp deletion in this region which included a small part of the Alu sequence in intron 20, the entire exon 21, and most of the Alu sequence in intron 21. The polymorphic TaqI site, which lies within the Alu sequence in intron 21, was absent in the proband as a result of the deletion. The deletion of exon 21 results in a frame shift mutation and the introduction of a stop codon. Translation of the encoded mRNA would yield a prematurely terminated protein. This mutant apoB protein would be 1085 amino acids long with the 73 carboxyl-terminal residues out of frame. We postulate that the deletion of exon 21 is the consequence of a crossover event between the Alu sequences in introns 20 and 21 resulting in nonreciprocal exchange between two chromosomes.
Chloracne is a characteristic marker of intoxication by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or related compounds. Decreased lipogenesis is a prominent clinical sign in this disease. However, the activity of dioxins on human sebaceous glands is still unclear. In this study, the effects of TCDD on sebaceous gland differentiation were studied both in human skin samples maintained ex vivo and in cultured SZ95 sebocytes. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein expression, the receptor for dioxin, was detected in SZ95 sebocytes. Its expression was markedly inhibited by TCDD. Furthermore, we detected a reduced release of neutral lipids (10(-10) -10(-8) M; P<0.001) and decreased expression of epithelial membrane antigen and keratin 7, all of which are specific markers of sebaceous differentiation. Markedly, increased expression of the keratinocyte differentiation marker keratin 10 and of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-δ was assessed in SZ95 sebocytes treated with TCDD. To corroborate these in vitro data, an ex vivo sebaceous gland-rich skin culture model was investigated. Obvious shrinkage of sebaceous glands with sebaceous duct hyperplasia and increased expression of keratin 10 in the atrophic sebaceous glands were observed on the 5th day of TCDD treatment. In conclusion, TCDD affects the differentiation of sebaceous gland cells probably by switching human sebaceous into keratinocyte-like differentiation. In addition and together with the results of a parallel study (J Dermatol Sci 58, 2010, 211), we provide evidence that TCDD effects on human sebocytes are mediated through the AhR signalling pathway.
A sizable body of research has been devoted to understanding the relationship between pain sensitivity and the psychological state of the individual. Considerable disagreement as to the direction of the association still exists. This study examines the effects of 2 experimental manipulations, cognitive/emotional stress and relaxation, on capsaicin-induced pain. Subjects were pretrained in relaxation and then randomized to experimental stress produced by a 20-minute Stroop test, relaxation (tape), or a control condition (neutral video), followed by a capsaicin injection in the forearm. Cardiovascular measures were taken at regular intervals, and cortisol, norepinephrine (NE), and self-reports of arousal (relaxation index) were taken immediately before and after the experimental task. The manipulation significantly interacted with sex to predict capsaicin-induced maximum pain. Women in the stress condition reported greater pain than both men in the stress condition and women in the relaxation condition. Pain was correlated negatively with task-induced changes in NE and cortisol and positively with self-reported arousal (decreased relaxation). However, separate analyses showed that some physiologic indexes of heightened arousal (increased blood pressure and NE) predicted lower pain only in men, whereas subjective increases in arousal predicted higher pain only in women. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses confirmed that physiologic and self-reported arousal predicted pain independently and in opposite directions, and a model including both accounted for 56% of the overall variance. These findings suggest that a unidimensional model of arousal may be insufficient to explain the effects of stress on pain and that these effects operate differently in men and women.
Quantitative vibration perception threshold (VPT) measurements were performed on 134 healthy subjects and 147 epileptics undergoing prolonged (more than one year) antiepileptic treatment, 28 patients received diphenylhydantoin, 71 carbamazepine and 11 some other drug. 37 subjects received a combination of drugs, which included diphenylhydantoin and/or carbamazepine. VPT was measured quantitatively at the dorsum of the right foot with a device vibrating at 100 Hz. The mean of the four successive threshold values was calculated. VPTs of the epileptic groups treated with diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine or combined medication were all significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than those of the control group. The group receiving other medication showed no difference in this respect. The percentage of patients with abnormal thresholds was about the same (10-16) in the epileptic groups. An exception was the group taking other medication, in which no abnormal VPTs were found. It is suggested that such quantitative measurement may be a useful screening method for detecting dysfunction in the peripheral nervous system due to prolonged antiepileptic treatment. It will, however, be necessary to test the clinical validity of the method for diagnosing manifest or subclinical polyneuropathies.
Teriparatide (TPTD) [recombinant human PTH(1-34)] given sc once daily transiently increases serum calcium concentrations at 4-6 h after dosing, but its effects on urinary calcium excretion are less well studied.
Our objective was to evaluate urinary calcium excretion, a prespecified safety endpoint, for up to 12 months of TPTD treatment.
This study included two prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.
A total of 2074 participants with osteoporosis or low bone mass (study 1, 1637 postmenopausal women; study 2, 437 men) were included.
Participants were given calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400-1200 IU/d) supplements, and were randomized to placebo, TPTD 20 mug/d, or TPTD 40 mug/d.
Urinary calcium excretion was measured in 24-h collections at baseline, 1, 6, and 12 months.
In each study, baseline urinary calcium excretion was similar among groups. All groups had significantly increased urinary calcium excretion, compared with baseline, at most post-baseline time points. Post-baseline urinary calcium excretion was increased in the TPTD 20 microg/d group by up to 32 mg/d compared with placebo at the same time point (P < 0.05) in study 1. A total of seven participants (0.3%), of which three and four were in the placebo and TPTD groups, respectively, discontinued study drug due to repeated hypercalciuria (>300 mg/d).
Urinary calcium excretion was increased with TPTD treatment for up to 12 months, compared with placebo and baseline values, but the magnitude of these changes is unlikely to be clinically relevant or warrant urinary calcium monitoring for most patients.
A comparative multicenter clinical trial of two low-dose combined oral contraceptives (OCs) was conducted in Malaysia, Egypt, Thailand, and Mexico. Efficacy, safety and acceptability were investigated in women taking either a norgestrel-based (NG) OC or a norethindrone acetate-based (NA) OC. This paper includes analysis of 892 women, all of whom were at least 42 days but within 26 weeks postpartum and randomly allocated to one of the above OCs. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 4, 8 and 12 months after admission. Baseline sociodemographic characteristics were similar for both groups, as well as compliance. There were nine unintended pregnancies reported; eight of these occurring in the NA group. Adverse experiences were minor with headaches and dizziness being the most common complaints; frequency of reports was similar in both groups. The group taking the NG-based OC had significantly (p < .05) fewer menstrual-related complaints. Discontinuations due to menstrual problems were significantly more common among NA users (primarily amenorrhea). Discontinuations in the NG group were primarily for other personal reasons, e.g. unable to return to the clinic. There was also a significant difference between the two groups for the 11-month gross cumulative life table discontinuation rates due to menstrual problems (p < .01); the NA group had the higher rate.
