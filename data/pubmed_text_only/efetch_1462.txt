The present study used pharmacological and gene ablation techniques to examine the involvement of kappa opioid receptors (KOPr) in modulating the convulsant effects of two mechanistically different drugs: cocaine and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; GABA-A receptor antagonist) in mice. Systemic administration of the selective KOPr-1 agonist, U69593 (0.16-0.6mg/kg; s.c.), failed to modify cocaine-evoked convulsions or cocaine kindling. Similarly, no alteration in responsiveness to cocaine was observed in wild-type mice that received the selective KOPr-1 antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI; 5mg/kg) or in mice lacking the gene encoding KOPr-1. In contrast to cocaine, U69593 attenuated the seizures induced by acute or repeated PTZ administration. Nor-BNI decreased the threshold for PTZ-evoked seizures and increased seizure incidence during the initial induction of kindling relative to controls. Decreased thresholds for PTZ-induced seizures were also observed in KOPr-1 knock out mice. Together, these data demonstrate an involvement of endogenous KOPr systems in modulating vulnerability to the convulsant effects of PTZ but not cocaine. Furthermore, they demonstrate that KOPr-1 activation protects against acute and kindled seizures induced by this convulsant. Finally, the results of our study suggest that KOPr-1 antagonists will not have therapeutic utility against cocaine-induced seizures, while they may prove beneficial in attenuating several actions of cocaine that have been linked to its abuse.
The aim of the study was to assess the safety of dobutamine echocardiography (DE) in patients with aortic stenosis and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 45%.
162 patients (mean age 59 +/- 13, 64% males) with resting transvalvular peak gradient < 70 mmHg underwent standard DE (doses 5-40 micrograms/kg/min) in a multicenter study involving 10 centers from Poland and Hungary. This analysis involves a subset of 39 pts (34 M, 5 F, age 59 +/- 13) identified according to the criterion of EF < or = 45% and mean aortic gradient < or = 35 mmHg. Clinically indicated coronary arteriography was performed in all patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
Peak dobutamine dose was 29 +/- 10 micrograms/kg/min. Peak heart rate was 112 +/- 26 bpm. Systolic arterial pressure was 148 +/- 20 mmHg and diastolic pressure 86 +/- 14 mmHg. Transaortic mean gradient and aortic valve area increased 35 +/- 34% and 19 +/- 15% during peak dobutamine dose, respectively. Ejection fraction improved 16 +/- 14%. The test was positive in 17 (43.6%) patients, negative in 11 (28.2%) patients and non diagnostic in 11 (28.2%) patients. There were no deaths, myocardial infarctions or episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia as a result of DE. The test was terminated when the following conditions were met: Target heart rate (23.%). Left ventricular asynergy (46.2%). Maximal established dose achieved (7.7%). Side effects (20.5%). The most common side effects were ventricular arrhythmias (35.9%), dyspnea (20.5%) and hypotension < 20 mmHg (10.3%).
Despite frequent side effects, DE can be safely performed in patients with aortic stenosis and depressed left ventricular contractility.
The clinical potential of mefloquine has been compromised by reports of adverse neurological effects. A series of 4-quinolinecarbinolamines were compared in terms of neurotoxicity and antimalarial activity in an attempt to identify replacement drugs. Neurotoxicity (MTT [thiazolyl blue reduction] assay) was assessed by exposure of cultured embryonic rat neurons to graded concentrations of the drugs for 20 min. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of mefloquine was 25 microM, while those of the analogs were 19 to 200 microM. The relative (to mefloquine) therapeutic indices of the analogs were determined after using the tritiated hypoxanthine assay for assessment of the antimalarial activity of the analogs against mefloquine-sensitive (W2) and -resistant (D6 and TM91C235) Plasmodium falciparum strains. Five analogs, WR157801, WR073892, WR007930, WR007333, and WR226253, were less neurotoxic than mefloquine and exhibited higher relative therapeutic indices (RTIs) against TM91C235 (2.9 to 12.2). Conventional quinoline antimalarials were generally less neurotoxic (IC(50)s of 400, 600, and 900 for amodiaquine, chloroquine, and quinine) or had higher RTIs (e.g., 30 for halofantrine against TM91C235). The neurotoxicity data for the 4-quinolinecarbinolamines were used to develop a three-dimensional (3D), function-based pharmacophore. The crucial molecular features correlated with neurotoxicity were a hydrogen bond acceptor (lipid) function, an aliphatic hydrophobic function, and a ring aromatic function specifically distributed in the 3D surface of the molecule. Mapping of the 3D structures of a series of structurally diverse quinolines to the pharmacophore allowed accurate qualitative predictions of neurotoxicity (or not) to be made. Extension of this in silico screening approach may aid in the identification of less-neurotoxic quinoline analogs.
Cyclophosphamide (CY) is an alkylating agent used for the treatment of various types of cancer and is also used as a potent immunosuppressant. Acrolein, a metabolite of CY is cytotoxic and has the ability to covalently bind with proteins in vitro to form acrolein-protein adducts. These protein adducts are considered to be putative markers of oxidative stress and cause damage to protein in aging, atherosclerosis and diabetes. We have, for the first time, detected acrolein-lysine adducts in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and in the aorta of CY-treated animals by agarose gel electrophoresis, immunoblot and immunohistochemical methods. The extent of lipid peroxidation caused by the metabolite acrolein in plasma LDL was also measured quantitatively by using high-performance liquid chromatography. These results confirm the role of acrolein-lysine adducts in the development of atherosclerosis or atherogenesis.
The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common disorder, where systemic insulin-resistance is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. Identifying genetic traits influencing risk and progression of MetS is important. We and others previously reported a functional HMGA1 gene variant, rs146052672, predisposing to T2D. Here we investigated the association of rs146052672 variant with MetS and related components. In a case-control study from Italy and Turkey, increased risk of MetS was seen among carriers of the HMGA1 variant. In the larger Italian cohort, this variant positively correlated with BMI, hyperglycemia and insulin-resistance, and negatively correlated with serum HDL-cholesterol. Association between rs146052672 variant and MetS occurred independently of T2D, indicating that HMGA1 gene defects play a pathogenetic role in MetS and other insulin-resistance-related conditions. Overall, our results indicate that the rs146052672 variant represents an early predictive marker of MetS, as well as a predictive tool for therapy.
For many neurosurgical procedures, elective hypotension is used to reduce the risk of cerebral vessel rupture and hypocapnia is used to constrict cerebral vessels, thereby reducing cerebral blood volume. Although nitroglycerin (NTG) often is used to produce hypotension during neurological surgery, it is not known whether NTG-induced cerebral vasodilation interferes with the cerebral vasoconstrictor response to hypocapnia. This study examined cerebral vascular responses to hypocapnia during NTG-induced hypotension in eight dogs that were lightly anesthetized with halothane and had an open cranium. Cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) at PaCO2 = 40 mm Hg and at PaCO2 = 20 mm Hg were examined first at normal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and then at MAP = 50 mm Hg. CO2 responsiveness, as indicated by increased CVR and decreased CBF, was intact at normal MAP but absent during hypotension. These results suggest that the cerebral vasodilation that accompanies NTG-induced hypotension exerts a greater influence on cerebral vessels than the cerebral vasoconstricting influence of hypocapnia. It is concluded that, during NTG-induced hypotension and craniotomy, hypocapnia will not reduce cerebral blood volume or further decrease CBF to cause ischemia.
Despite a trend for reduction in the concentration of free formaldehyde in textiles, formaldehyde textile resin (FTR) allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) remains an important clinical issue and is likely underdiagnosed. Patients with FTR ACD may react to formaldehyde released from the resin or to the resin itself. Screening with formaldehyde and ethyleneurea/melamine formaldehyde resin will uncover most cases. Patch testing with the suspected offending fabric most often leads to false-negative results. We present a case of a 49-year-old pediatrician who developed a severe widespread dermatitis caused by contact with FTRs from her hospital "greens" ("scrubs") and mask.
Paraplegia following prophylactic intrathecal cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) is described in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia in remission who received doses of 100 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days. Cerebrospinal fluid examination prior to the last dosage of cytosine arabinoside revealed a mononuclear pleocytosis and increased protein. The neurological manifestations developed within one week after the last dose of Ara-C and persisted for over 8 weeks. Administration of intrathecal Ara-C in the same dose over longer intervals within 3-5 days between consecutive doses resulted in mild, transient neurological symptoms (paresthesias) in only one of 30 patients so treated.
Kodimagnyl is a widely used analgesic agent, particularly in outpatient practice. It is a combination of morphine and acetylsalicylic acid. We report here two cases of hypokalaemia as a result of abuse of Kodimagnyl, which to our knowledge has never been reported previously. The acetylsalicylic acid component may in all probability be the cause of the hypokalaemia. Kodimagnyl is generally not included in a standard toxicology screen but should be considered in cases of hypokalaemia.
Mutation frequencies (MnFs) of the lacI transgene and mutation rates (MRs) of the endogenous hprt gene were analyzed in two mammary carcinoma cell lines that we established from mammary carcinomas that had been induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in female lacI-transgenic rats. Using the lacI transgene, corrected MnF, which is the number of independent lacI mutations that occurred while 102 cells expanded into 10(7) cells and which reflect the dynamic increase of point mutations, was measured. The corrected MnFs in the two mammary carcinoma cell lines (59 x 10(-6) and 72 x 10(-6) mutations) were significantly higher than that in the primary culture of normal mammary epithelium (4.7 x 10(-6)). MRs of the hprt gene in the two mammary carcinoma cell lines (8.2 x 10(-7) and 11 x 10(-7) mutations/hprt/cell division) were also higher than the same control (1.4 x 10(-7)). A:T to C:G transversion was observed at significantly higher frequencies in the two cell lines (6 of 24 and 6 of 25 for lacI; 10 of 67 and 19 of 92 for hprt) than in the control (0 of 6 for lacI; 0 of 4 for hprt). Taking advantage of the lacI transgene, high frequencies of A:T to C:G transversion (6 of 38 and 8 of 33, respectively) was also confirmed in the primary carcinomas of the two cell lines, which indicated the presence of a common abnormality in the cell lines and in the primary carcinomas. Both the established cell lines and their primary carcinomas were negative for microsatellite instability, which is known to be caused mainly by mismatch repair insufficiency and to increase point mutations, and for p53 mutations. These findings showed that the two cell lines, and possibly their primary carcinomas, had increases in the MRs of point mutations attributable to a mechanism(s) different from mismatch repair insufficiency, and we would suggest that such a state be designated as single nucleotide instability (SNI).
Blood pressure, forearm arterial hemodynamics (with a pulsed Doppler flowmeter), and echocardiographic parameters were studied in 16 patients with sustained essential hypertension before and 3 months after administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril. In a single-blind study versus placebo, it was shown that perindopril significantly reduced blood pressure (p less than 0.01), whereas there was an increase in brachial blood flow (p less than 0.01) because of a simultaneous increase in blood flow velocity (p less than 0.01) and arterial diameter (p less than 0.01). During a 5-minute period of wrist occlusion, blood flow velocity was reduced to a greater extent with perindopril than with placebo (p less than 0.001), whereas corresponding reductions in arterial diameter were equivalent, indicating that the increase in diameter after perindopril could not be explained simply on the basis of flow-dependent dilatation. During active treatment, brachial artery compliance increased (p less than 0.01) and pulse wave velocity decreased (p less than 0.01), whereas there was no change in the tangential tension of the arterial wall, defined as the product of mean arterial pressure and arterial diameter. Four weeks after treatment was stopped, blood pressure and forearm arterial hemodynamics returned toward baseline values. Cardiac mass was significantly decreased after perindopril (p less than 0.01) and remained decreased 4 weeks after cessation of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are key elements in the signaling cascades that lie downstream of many cellular receptors. In particular, PI3K delta and gamma isoforms contribute to inflammatory cell recruitment and subsequent activation. For this reason, in a series of preclinical studies, we tested the potential of a recently developed small-molecule inhibitor of these two isoforms, TG100-115 [3-[2,4-diamino-6-(3-hydroxyphenyl)pteridin-7-yl]phenol], as a form of anti-inflammatory therapy for respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To determine pharmacokinetic profiles, aerosolized formulations of the drug were delivered to mice by a nose-only inhalation route, yielding high pulmonary TG100-115 levels with minimal systemic exposure. Safety assessments were favorable, with no clinical or histological changes noted after 21 days of daily dosing. In a murine asthma model, aerosolized TG100-115 markedly reduced the pulmonary eosinophilia and the concomitant interleukin-13 and mucin accumulation characteristic of this disease. As a functional benefit, interventional dosing schedules of this inhibitor also reduced airway hyper-responsiveness. To model the pulmonary neutrophilia characteristic of COPD, mice were exposed to either intranasal lipopolysaccharide or inhaled smoke. Aerosolized TG100-115 again inhibited these inflammatory patterns, most notably in the smoke model, where interventional therapy overcame the steroid-resistant nature of the pulmonary inflammation. In conclusion, aerosolized TG100-115 displays pharmacokinetic, safety, and biological activity profiles favorable for further development as a therapy for both asthma and COPD. Furthermore, these studies support the hypothesis that PI3K delta and gamma are suitable molecular targets for these diseases.
Homeostasis of the hematopoietic system is tightly regulated by an array of cytokines that control proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of various cell lineages. To identify genes that are essential for hematopoietic homeostasis, we screened C57BL/6 mice that had been genome-wide mutagenized by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) to produce altered blood cell composition. We identified a mutant mouse line with a drastic reduction in the number of T and B cell lineages in lymphatic tissues and peripheral blood, as well as severe atrophy of the thymus and lymph nodes. Genotyping with a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker set mapped the mutant phenotype to chromosome 3A and subsequent direct DNA sequencing revealed a G-to-A point mutation in the splicing donor site of the third exon of the candidate gene for IL-7, a lymphocyte survival cytokine. Such mutation resulted in skipping of exon 3 and production of an internally truncated IL-7 (DeltaE3-IL7). Furthermore, using recombinant proteins produced in a baculoviral system, we demonstrated that DeltaE3-IL7 had no detectable anti-apoptotic activity even at a dose that was 30 times more than that required for a wild-type protein to manifest a full activity in a naïve T cell survival assay. Our data suggest that this mutant mouse line provides an alternative animal model for the study of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) syndrome in humans.
The consumption of diets rich in plant foods are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. This study was aimed to evaluate the role of S-allylcysteine (SAC) in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Subcutaneous injection of ISO (150 mg/kg) to Wistar rats showed a significant decrease in the activities of marker enzymes such as creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate and alanine transaminases in heart and a significant increase in the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid hydroperoxides in plasma and heart. ISO-induced rats also showed a significant decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase in heart and the levels of glutathione and ascorbic acid in plasma and heart. Oral administration of SAC (100 and 150 mg/kg) to ISO-treated rats daily for a period of 45 days caused a significant increase in the activities of marker enzymes and improved the antioxidant status by decreasing lipid peroxidative products and increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of nonenzyomic antioxidants. Administration of SAC to normal rats did not show any significant effect. Histopathological findings of the myocardial tissue showed a protective role of SAC in ISO-treated rats. The effect at a dose of 150 mg/kg of SAC was more pronounced than that of the dose 100mg/kg and brought back all the parameters to near normal. The effect exerted by 100 mg/kg of SAC was similar to that of alpha-tocopherol (60 mg/kg). The results of our study show that SAC possesses antioxidant activity in ISO-induced experimental MI.
Liver tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) are capable of self-renewal and tumor initiation and are more chemoresistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The current therapeutic strategies for targeting stem cell self-renewal pathways therefore represent rational approaches for cancer prevention and treatment. In the present study, we found that Lup-20(29)-en-3β-ol (lupeol), a triterpene found in fruits and vegetables, inhibited the self-renewal ability of liver T-ICs present in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and clinical HCC samples, as reflected by hepatosphere formation. Furthermore, lupeol inhibited in vivo tumorigenicity in nude mice and down-regulated CD133 expression, which was previously shown to be a T-IC marker for HCC. In addition, lupeol sensitized HCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents through the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-Akt-ABCG2 pathway. PTEN plays a crucial role in the self-renewal and chemoresistance of liver T-ICs; down-regulation of PTEN by a lentiviral-based approach reversed the effect of lupeol on liver T-ICs. Using an in vivo chemoresistant HCC tumor model, lupeol dramatically decreased the tumor volumes of MHCC-LM3 HCC cell line-derived xenografts, and the effect was equivalent to that of combined cisplatin and doxorubicin treatment. Lupeol exerted a synergistic effect without any adverse effects on body weight when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs.
Our results suggest that lupeol may be an effective dietary phytochemical that targets liver T-ICs.
We report a 60-year-old woman with renovascular hypertension who developed a severe cutaneous vasculitis 24 h after the injection of iopamidol during urography. A review of the literature suggests that her concomitant hydralazine therapy probably predisposed her to this reaction, as similar reactions have occurred in systemic lupus erythematosus, and hydralazine can induce a LE-like syndrome. We recommend that urography should be avoided in patients receiving hydralazine.
Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs show efficacy in the prevention of cancers. It is known that they can inhibit cyclooxygenases, and some studies have shown that they can induce apoptosis. Our objective in this study was to investigate the mechanism by which aspirin exerts its apoptosis effects in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. The effect of aspirin on the gene expression was studied by differential mRNA display RT-PCR. Among the isolated genes, mu-type calpain gene was upregulated by aspirin treatment. To examine whether calpain mediates the antitumor effects, HeLa cells were stably transfected with the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 containing mu-type calpain cDNA (pCRCAL/HeLa), and tumor formations were measured in nude mice. When tumor burden was measured by day 49, HeLa cells and pCR/HeLa cells (vector control) produced tumors of 2126 mm(3) and 1638 mm(3), respectively, while pCRCAL/HeLa cells produced markedly smaller tumor of 434 mm(3) in volume. The caspase-3 activity was markedly elevated in pCRCAL/HeLa cells. The increased activity levels of caspase-3 in pCRCAL/HeLa cells, in parallel with the decreased tumor formation, suggest a correlation between caspase-3 activity and calpain protein. Therefore, we conclude that aspirin-induced calpain mediates an antitumor effect via caspase-3 in cervical cancer cells.
Long standing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with testicular dysfunction and subfertility. Few studies have addressed the pathogenesis of testicular injury in RA and its modulation by effective agents. Thus, the current study aimed at evaluating the effects of two testosterone boosting agents; chrysin, a natural flavone and celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in testicular impairment in rats with adjuvant arthritis, an experimental model of RA. Chrysin (25 and 50mg/kg) and celecoxib (5mg/kg) were orally administered to Wistar rats once daily for 21days starting 1h before arthritis induction. Chrysin suppressed paw edema with comparable efficacy to celecoxib. More important, chrysin, dose-dependently and celecoxib attenuated the testicular injury via reversing lowered gonadosomatic index and histopathologic alterations with preservation of spermatogenesis. Both agents upregulated steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) mRNA expression and serum testosterone with concomitant restoration of LH and FSH. Furthermore, they suppressed inflammation via abrogation of myeloperoxidase, TNF-α and protein expression of COX-2 and iNOS besides elevation of IL-10. Alleviation of the testicular impairment was accompanied with suppression of oxidative stress via lowering testicular lipid peroxides and nitric oxide. With respect to apoptosis, both agents downregulated FasL mRNA expression and caspase-3 activity in favor of cell survival. For the first time, these findings highlight the protective effects of chrysin and celecoxib against testicular dysfunction in experimental RA which were mediated via boosting testosterone in addition to attenuation of testicular inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Generally, the 50mg/kg dose of chrysin exerted comparable protective actions to celecoxib.
To observe the effects of CYP2E1 enzymatic alteration upon hematotoxicity by benzene poisoning in mice and the interference of alcohol and Curcuma longa.
Eighty male Kunming mice (KM) were randomly divided into four groups: group A (20 mice injected subcutaneously with sodium chloride 2 ml/kg once every 2 days for 3 weeks as normal control group); group B (20 mice injected subcutaneously with 2 ml/kg benzene once every 2 days for 3 weeks as model group); group C (20 mice drinking freely 10% alcohol per day on the basis of benzene poisoning model as alcohol-treated group) and group D (20 mice given Curcuma longa 3 g/kg once a day on the basis of benzene poisoning model as Curcuma-treated group). Then the blood samples were collected so as to count the parameters of WBC, Hb, PLT. In addition, the liver cytochrome P450 activity and MN formation rate were measured.
(1) Compared with group A, WBC, Hb and PLT of group B significantly decreased [(2.6 +/- 1.0) x 10(9)/L, (93 +/- 11) g/L, (593 +/- 81) x 10(9)/L]. (2) Compared with group B, the parameters of group C decreased (P < 0.05) while the liver cytochrome P450 activity of group C increased. It indicated that alcohol improved the activity of CYP2E1 and the MN formation rate of group C also increased [(8.8 +/- 1.8) per thousand vs(6.5 +/- 1.0) per thousand, P < 0.01]. (3) Compared with group B, the parameters of group D improved (P < 0.01). The activity of CYP2E1 of group D decreased and the difference was significant (P < 0.01). In the meantime, MN formation rate decreased (P < 0.01).
(1) When the liver cytochrome P450 activity were altered, the hematotoxicity of benzene poisoning in mice underwent changes. (2) Alcohol increases the hematotoxicity induced by benzene poisoning in mice. (3) Curcuma longa has preventive effect against the hematotoxity of benzene.
Little is known about the effects of methyl iodide (MI) on the skin after short-term accidental cutaneous exposure because this type of exposure to MI has rarely been reported. In the present case, asymptomatic vesicles developed within 24 hours of exposure, an acute hemorrhagic eruption developed several days later, and an erythematous edematous eruption and large bullae developed several days after the hemorrhagic eruption. This sequence of findings was remarkably similar to the most recently reported case of short-term accidental MI exposure, and we believe that the findings described and the time course of the findings may be a reproducible phenomenon following this type of cutaneous exposure to MI.
Zoledronic acid has been shown to be effective in the treatment of osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, and metastatic bone tumors. The efficacy of zoledronic acid on primary bone tumors has not been investigated.
A primary bone tumor mouse model was established. Intratibia injection of TC71 cells resulted in an osteolytic bone tumor. Four days after injection the mice were treated with zoledronic acid alone, paclitaxel alone, or zoledronic acid plus paclitaxel. Control mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline. Bone tumor growth was assessed using a Faxitron Specimen Radiography System. The gene expression was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), ELISA, and immunohistochemistry. Osteoclast formation was determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining.
Zoledronic acid induced apoptosis in TC71 human Ewing sarcoma cells and inhibited cell proliferation. Five weeks after injection, 89% of mice in the control group developed osteolytic bone tumors. Paclitaxel had little effect on bone tumor growth, with 78% of mice developing tumors. By contrast, 44% of mice treated with zoledronic acid developed bone tumors. The most effective treatment was zoledronic acid plus paclitaxel. Tumor incidence in the combination therapy group was only 22%. Osteoclasts were quantified using TRAP staining. There was a decrease in TRAP-positive osteoclasts in tumor tissues from zoledronic acid-treated animals compared to control animals. RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA assay demonstrated that zoledronic acid up-regulated osteoprotegerin expression.
These results suggest that zoledronic acid induces apoptosis and inhibits primary bone tumor growth in Ewing sarcoma through a mechanism involving the up-regulation of osteoprotegerin. Zoledronic acid may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with Ewing sarcoma.
Treatment of extremity soft-tissue sarcomas yields excellent local control, but distant failure is common with large, high-grade tumors. A regimen of preoperative chemotherapy consisting of mesna, adriamycin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine (MAID) interdigitated with radiotherapy followed by resection and postoperative chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy was designed to improve treatment outcome. We report the mature outcome data on 48 treated patients and compare them with the data of an historical matched control patient population.
Adult patients with high-grade extremity soft-tissue sarcomas >or=8 cm were treated with three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy combined with 44 Gy of radiotherapy followed by surgery. Three cycles of postoperative MAID were planned. For patients with positive surgical margins, 16 Gy was delivered postoperatively.
All 48 patients (M0) received the MAID protocol treatment, and their outcome was superior to that of the historical control patients. The 5-year actuarial local control, freedom from distant metastasis, disease-free survival, and overall survival rate was 92% and 86% (p = 0.1155), 75% and 44% (p = 0.0016), 70% and 42% (p = 0.0002), and 87% and 58% (p = 0.0003) for the MAID and control patient groups, respectively. Acute hematologic toxicity in the MAID group included febrile neutropenia in 12 patients (25%). Wound healing complications occurred in 14 (29%) of 48 MAID patients. One MAID patient developed late fatal myelodysplasia.
After aggressive chemoradiation and surgery, these patients showed a significant reduction in distant metastases, with a highly significant gain in disease-free and overall survival compared with a historical control group. On the basis of this experience, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conducted a multi-institutional trial.
A 59-year-old man with severe variceal bleeding received therapy with intravenously administered vasopressin and cimetidine. Inappropriate bradycardia, sinoatrial and atrioventricular blocks, and terminal bradycardia leading to asystole, occurred during bleeding, with the greatest number of rhythm abnormalities occurring during combined cimetidine and vasopressin therapy. The results of post-mortem examination showed only mild coronary artery disease. The hazards of combined vasopressin and cimetidine therapy are reviewed.
Cocaine and opioid dependence are common, complex disorders with high heritability that commonly co-occur with other substance dependence disorders. Improved insight into the genetic basis of substance dependence would help elucidate its etiology and could inform its prevention and treatment. To generate new hypotheses about the genetics of substance dependence, we genotyped 5633 tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in 1699 subjects from 339 African American (AA) families and 334 European American (EA) families ascertained through a sib pair meeting DSM-IV criteria for either cocaine or opioid dependence. The associations between genetic markers and five substance dependence traits (cocaine dependence, opioid dependence, cocaine-induced paranoia, alcohol dependence, and nicotine dependence) were assessed by family based association tests (FBAT). Results were ranked according to several criteria including statistical significance, concordance of results across population samples, and potential biological relevance of the implicated gene. The top-ranked result was an association of SNP rs1133503 in the MANEA gene with cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP). Our study provides an initial substance dependence trait-specific blueprint of associated regions for future candidate gene studies.
A low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide may effectively reduce blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients, but some factors related to study design might have contributed to the between-group differences in the rate of reduction of BP observed in some trials.
The aim of this study was to systematically assess the efficacy and safety profiles (through review of randomized, controlled trials) of the fixed, low-dose combination perindopril 2 mg and indapamide 0.625 mg given as 1 tablet daily as first-line antihypertensive therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
We searched MEDLINE (1966-April 2003), EMBASE (1980-March 2003), BIOSIS (1999-December 2002), and the Cochrane Library, using the medical subject headings with the search terms perindopril, indapamide, hypertension, randomized controlled trials, randomly, random, randomization, perindopril-indapamide, essential hypertension, and primary hypertension. Additional articles were obtained from the reference lists of relevant reviews and papers.
We reviewed 11 trials (5936 individuals). In 5 studies of perindopril-indapamide versus placebo, the between-group weighted mean differences (WMDs) for both systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively) favored perindopril-indapamide (SBP, -9.03 mm Hg [95% CI, -9.54 to -8.52]; DBP, -5.09 mm Hg [95% Cl, -5.42 to -4.77]; both P < 0.01 for z score for overall effect). In 6 studies of perindopril-indapamide versus routine antihypertensives, the between-group WMDs for SBP and DBP favored perindopril-indapamide (SBP, -3.72 mm Hg [95% CI, -7.11 to 0.33], P = 0.03 for z score for overall effect; DBP, -1.71 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.27 to -1.16], P < 0.01 for z score for overall effect). Five studies compared perindopril-indapamide and placebo; in the remaining 3 studies, which assessed perindopril-indapamide versus routine antihypertensives, the between-group WMDs for SBP and DBP favored perindopril-indapamide (SBP, -4.00 mm Hg [95% CI, -6.54 to -1.47], P < 0.01; DBP, -1.02 mm Hg [95% CI, -1.73 to -0.31], P < 0.01). Adverse events and withdrawals were not significantly different between perindopril-indapamide, placebo, or routine antihypertensive drugs.
The studies in our analysis consistently demonstrated that a fixed, low-dose perindopril-indapamide combination has a favorable safety profile and may be efficacious as first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the first choice immunosuppressant universally used in allotransplantation. However, it has been demonstrated that this drug produces unwanted side effects in several organs and in particular in the kidney and in the heart. While the cardiac toxicity, due to alteration of myocardial prostanoid has been reported, no data are available about the effects of CsA on myocardial cytoarchitecture. We studied the CsA induced alterations of the myocardial structure and of the extracellular matrix components (ECM). To test the ECM enzymatic chances we studied a family of enzymes (matrix metalloproteinase-MMP), responsible for the degradation of extracellular matrix components. In particular we investigated MMPI, MMP2 and MMP9. The study was carried out on two groups of Wistar rats. The group I animals served as a control and were injected subcutaneously daily with castor oil for 21 days. Group II: animals were subcutaneously injected daily with CsA (dose: 15 mg/Kg in castor oil) for 21 days. The group I animals (control) had normal heart architecture and low levels of MMPI, MMP2 and MMP9. The group II animals showed degenerative changes with myocardial fibrosis, low levels of MMP1 and MMP9 but a clear increase in MMP2. We suggest that the myocardial fibrosis was a consequence of the cardiotoxic effect of CsA determining the alteration of the balance between synthesis and degradation of ECM. The increase in MMP2 suggests that this enzyme could play a protective role during myocardial damage and represent a compensatory mechanism for the excessive accumulation of collagen.
