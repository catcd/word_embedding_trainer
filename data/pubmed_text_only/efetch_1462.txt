Risk factors for nephrotoxicity in patients treated with aminoglycosides were determined from the case records of 214 patients in two prospective, randomized clinical trials of gentamicin and tobramycin. Nephrotoxicity, defined as a 50% or greater fall in calculated creatinine clearance, developed in 30 patients (14.1%). Patients with nephrotoxicity had higher initial calculated creatinine clearances, were more often women, and were more likely to have liver disease. Using stepwise discriminant analysis, these factors were selected with the initial 1-hour post-dose aminoglycoside level, patient age, and shock. An equation was generated that was accurate in discriminating between patients with and without nephrotoxicity when validated in an independent population. Factors that did not add significantly to the equation were diabetes, dehydration, serum bicarbonate, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, gentamicin or tobramycin use, duration of therapy, total aminoglycoside dose, or the use of clindamycin, furosemide, or cephalothin.
Systemic haemodynamics, plasma catecholamine levels and diurnal variation of arterial pressure were studied in a 20-year-old patient with hypertension during Guillain Barré syndrome after complete resolution of the illness. Transient arterial hypertension during the course of Guillain Barré syndrome is characterized by an increased total peripheral resistance associated with elevated circulating norepinephrine levels, suggesting an over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system as the underlying mechanism of the elevated blood pressure.
The effect of SCH 23390, a dopamine-one (D1) antagonist, in preventing acute toxicity induced by lethal doses of cocaine, d-amphetamine, and methamphetamine was studied in the rat. Animals were first pretreated with SCH 23390 (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and then were challenged with cocaine (70 mg/kg, i.p., an LD85), d-amphetamine (75 mg/kg, i.p., an LD95), and methamphetamine (100 mg/kg, i.p., an LD90). SCH 23390 did not alter the incidence of stimulant-induced seizures compared to the vehicle controls. Significant protection against cocaine-induced death was afforded only by the lowest dose of SCH 23390 tested. Significant protection against d-amphetamine-induced death was provided by all doses, with a dose dependent effect noted so that the incidence decreased from 95% for vehicle to 30% (p less than or equal to 0.01) with 2.5 mg/kg SCH 23390 pretreatment. No statistically significant reduction in the incidence of methamphetamine-induced death was seen with SCH 23390 pretreatment. The ability of SCH 23390 to protect against d-amphetamine, but apparently not against methamphetamine-induced death, suggests that different mechanisms of toxicity may exist between these drugs at high doses.
We report a case of a 33-year old male admitted to our hospital with extensive lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). This patient was several days post knee arthroscopy and had a family history strongly positive for DVT. Upon testing, he was found positive for the homozygous presence of Factor V gene R506Q mutation. In inherited thrombophillia, especially in homozygous Factor V Leiden, lifelong anticoagulation treatment and screening for asymptomatic family members is controversial. Upon review and consultation, however, we recommended oral anticoagulation for life, along with genetic counseling and screening for Factor V Leiden of his three children and younger brother.
A 76-year-old man developed a progressive bilateral hearing loss 4 days after starting a high dose of clarithromycin for atypical pulmonary tuberculosis. When the clarithromycin was discontinued the hearing improved subjectively but it worsened again upon reexposure. Halving the dose resulted in both an objective and subjective improvement in hearing, yet the original level of hearing was only obtained once clarithromycin had been permanently withdrawn. It would seem that this adverse effect is dose dependent. This seems to be the first published case study that demonstrates ototoxicity as a result of clarithromycin use.
Resveratrol, a polyphenol, found in skin of red grapes, peanuts and berries possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and lipid modulation properties. Here, we demonstrate in vivo antifibrotic activity of resveratrol in a mammalian model, wherein hepatic fibrosis was induced by N'-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) administration. Apart from being a potent hepatotoxin, NDMA is a known mutagen and carcinogen, as well. To induce hepatic fibrosis, rats were administered NDMA (i.p.) in 10mg/kgb.wt thrice/week for 21 days. Another group of animals received resveratrol supplement (10mg/kgb.wt) subsequent to NDMA administration and were sacrificed weekly. The changes in selected biomarkers were monitored to compare profibrotic effects of NDMA and antifibrotic activity of resveratrol. The selected biomarkers were: sera transaminases, ALP, bilirubin, liver glycogen, LPO, SOD, protein carbonyl content, ATPases (Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Na(+)/K(+)) and hydroxyproline/collagen content. Alterations in liver architecture were assessed by H&E, Masson's trichrome and reticulin staining of liver biopsies. Immuno-histochemistry and immunoblotting were employed to examine expression of α-SMA. Our results demonstrate that during NDMA-induced liver fibrosis transaminases, ALP, bilirubin, hydroxyproline and liver collagen increases, while liver glycogen is depleted. The decline in SOD (>65%) and ATPases, which were concomitant with the elevation in MDA and protein carbonyls, strongly indicate oxidative damage. Fibrotic transformation of liver in NDMA-treated rats was verified by histopathology, immuno-histochemistry and immunoblotting data, with the higher expressivity of α-SMA-positive HSCs being most established diagnostic immuno-histochemical marker of HSCs. Resveratrol-supplement refurbished liver architecture by significantly restoring levels of biomarkers of oxidative damage (MDA, SOD, protein carbonyls and membrane-bound ATPases). Therefore, we conclude that antifibrotic effect of resveratrol is due to restrained oxidative damage and down-regulation of α-SMA, which inhibits HSC activation to obstruct liver fibrosis.
Forty acutely psychotic patients were treated either with flupenthixol drops or haloperidol drops in an open, 28-day controlled study. The flupenthixol group comprised 11 schizophrenic, 8 manic, and 1 paranoid patient and there were 10 schizophrenic, 5 manic, and 5 paranoid patients in the haloperidol group. Mean daily dosage was approximately 112 mg flupenthixol and 18 mg haloperidol. Clinically, both drugs showed an antipsychotic effect. In the schizophrenic patients there was a definite trend towards a more rapid relief of the psychotic symptoms after flupenthixol treatment. In contrast to haloperidol, flupenthixol showed a mood elevating effect and an effect on the negative symptoms, e.g. emotional withdrawal, motor retardation, blunted affect, and disorientation. With both drugs, the most troublesome side-effects were extrapyramidal in nature. Initially, they were more common in the flupenthixol group: later the incidence was similar.
Nimodipine, a dihydropyridine derivative central nervous system (CNS) selective calcium channel blocker was studied at four different dosage schedules in five different models of seizures in rats. At a dose of 5 mg/kg, i.p. with pretreatment time of 15 min, nimodipine significantly antagonized aminophylline (175 and 200 mg/kg, i.p.), electroshock (150 mA for 0.2 s), pentylenetetrazole (60 and 75 mg/kg, i.p.), aminophylline (100 mg/kg i.p.) + electroshock (66mA for 0.2 s), and aminophylline (100 mg/kg, i.p.) + pentylenetetrazole (40 mg/kg, i.p.) induced seizures in rats. No hemodynamic alteration was observed with this dose of nimodipine. However, 2 mg/kg, i.p. (pretreatment time of 15 min and 30 min) and 5 mg/kg, i.p. (pretreatment time of 30 min) doses of nimodipine failed to demonstrate any significant anticonvulsant effect. The study highlighted the critical role of calcium ion flux into the neurons for the genesis of seizure activity to aminophylline, electroshock, and pentylenetetrazole in rats. Furthermore, the critical dose requirement for nimodipine could be explained on the basis of its short half-life and shorter duration of protection against seizures. Therefore, nimodipine may be tried clinically as an anticonvulsant in patients who are on aminophylline because of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, when such patients have concomitant epilepsy or other seizure prone neurological deficits or are scheduled to undergo electroshock therapy.
Although the lung constitutes the major exposure route for airborne manganese (Mn), little is known about the potential pulmonary effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Transition metals can mimic a hypoxia-like response, activating the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factor family. Through binding to the hypoxia-response element (HRE), these factors regulate expression of many genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Increases in VEGF, an important biomarker of angiogenesis, have been linked to respiratory diseases, including pulmonary hypertension. The objective of this study was to evaluate pulmonary hypoxia-associated angiogenic gene expression in response to exposure of soluble Mn(II) and to assess the genes' role as intermediaries of potential pulmonary Mn toxicity. In vitro, 0.25 mM Mn(II) altered morphology and slowed the growth of human pulmonary epithelial cell lines. Acute doses between 0.05 and 1 mM stimulated VEGF promoter activity up to 3.7-fold in transient transfection assays. Deletion of the HRE within the promoter had no effect on Mn(II)-induced VEGF expression but decreased cobalt [Co(II)]-induced activity 2-fold, suggesting that HIF-1 may not be involved in Mn(II)-induced VEGF gene transcription. Nose-only inhalation to 2 mg Mn(II)/m(3) for 5 days at 6 h/day produced no significant pulmonary inflammation but induced a 2-fold increase in pulmonary VEGF mRNA levels in adult mice and significantly altered expression of genes associated with murine angiogenesis. These findings suggest that even short-term exposures to soluble, occupationally relevant Mn(II) concentrations may alter pulmonary gene expression in pathways that ultimately could affect the lungs' susceptibility to respiratory disease.
An open study was carried out in 251 hypertensive patients, all but 10 of whom had been treated previously, mainly with beta-blockers or dihydralazine, to collect data primarily on the incidence of side-effects when long-term treatment with labetalol was substituted. Dosage ranged from 100 to 2400 mg per day (mean 654 mg per day) and treatment was continued for between 6 and 18 months (mean 7.8 months) in 229 patients. Labetalol proved to be at least as effective as previous therapy in the majority of patients and, although side-effects were reported in approximately half the study population, most were mild and transient requiring withdrawal in only 10%, within a few days or weeks in 20 patients. Scalp tingling was the most frequent of the side-effects particular to this drug. Postural hypotension and bradycardia was usually not very marked and troubles with micturition or sexual problems did not occur often. There was an improvement in Raynaud's and similar syndromes and arteritis in patients with these symptoms who had previously been receiving beta-blocking agents.
The aim of this study was to examine the influence of a continuous infusion of epinephrine (adrenaline) on mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), heart rate, urine output and base deficit in very low birthweight infants (VLBWI) with systemic hypotension. In VLBWI who received an infusion of epinephrine for at least 12 h the mean urine output, administered fluid volume, base deficit and administered buffer 12 h before and 12 h during the infusion were recorded. If the infusion was shorter, but given for at least 2 h, the mean heart rate and MABP 2 h before and 2 h during the infusion were recorded. Thirty-one infants with a gestational age of 26 (23-30) wk [median (minimum-maximum)] and birthweight 690 (390-1310) g were included in this retrospective chart review. The patients received an infusion of epinephrine at a postnatal age of 3 (1-21) d. The doses ranged between 0.05 and 2.6 microg kg(-1) per minute within the first 24 h of administration. Three of 31 infants received epinephrine on 2 different occasions. The MABP [+7 (-1 to 13) mmHg, p=0.000001] and the heart rate [+10 (-10 to 42) bpm, p=0.000036] increased significantly (n = 34), whereas total volume administration and urine output remained the same between the 2 periods (Wilcoxon matched pairs test). The base deficit increased significantly [-3 (-10.2 to 2.6), p = 0.0014, n = 19] without a change in the administration of buffer.
The infusion of epinephrine increased the MABP and the heart rate without decreasing urine output in VLBWI with hypotension not responding to a dopamine infusion up to 15 microg kg(-1) per minute. A potential adverse effect was an increase in metabolic acidosis.
A case of oral neomycin ototoxicity is presented, followed by a summary of known cases in the English literature. While it is known that neomycin is concentrated in the inner ear fluids, at the present time the biochemical basis of its ototoxic effect has not been definitively elucidated. High frequency audiometry can aid in the early detection of the onset of neomycin-induced deafness. Dialysis has a limited but useful role in preventing neomycin ototoxicity.
Absorption of calcium carbonate in the fasting state has been reported to be significantly compromised in subjects with achlorhydria. Although calcium carbonate malabsorption in the fasting state cannot be predicted, it might be corrected if the compound is administered with meals. However, administering calcium carbonate with meals is logistically challenging in long-term care facilities.
The aim of this study was to report the case of a woman who was transitioned to calcium citrate and subsequently experienced symptomatic severe hypercalcemia.
An 89-year-old female resident of the Wisconsin Veterans Home, a skilled nursing facility in King, Wisconsin, was receiving long-term treatment with ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 50,000 IU/d. The patient also was receiving calcium carbonate supplements in the morning, and she rarely ate breakfast (fasting state). The patient was transitioned from 2000 mg/d of elemental calcium as carbonate to 1230 mg/d as citrate.
After being switched from calcium carbonate to calcium citrate, the patient developed severe symptomatic hypercalcemia (16.8 mg/dL), the primary cause of which was the administration of an inappropriately high dose of vitamin D.
We report a case of symptomatic severe hypercalcemia in a skilled nursing facility resident treated with an inappropriately high daily dose of vitamin D. Hypercalcemia manifested when calcium carbonate was replaced with calcium citrate.
We evaluated the quantitative and temporal characteristics of the estrogen component of an estrogen-progesterone synergy, which can induce hyperprolactinemia in macaques. In Exp I, six groups of monkeys were treated for 2 weeks with various doses of estradiol benzoate (EB), which resulted in peripheral estradiol concentrations of 250-1500 pg/ml, followed by 2 weeks of combined estrogen and progesterone treatment. In each of the groups, regardless of the dosages of estradiol benzoate alone, PRL concentrations remained within normal limits (approximately 18 ng/ml). In contrast, during the subsequent period of combined EB and progesterone therapy, hyperprolactinemia developed. The resultant PRL concentrations were not dependent on the dose of EB administered. In Exp II, three groups of monkeys were treated with EB (25 micrograms/kg) alone for various intervals and subsequently with both EB and progesterone for 14 days. When initiation of progesterone therapy was preceded by a 9- or 6-day period of estrogen priming, PRL concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated within 3-4 days; in contrast, when the EB and progesterone treatments were initiated simultaneously, 8 days elapsed before the PRL elevations were significant. In a third experiment, to determine whether decidualized endometrium accounted for the increased PRL levels following estrogen and progesterone treatment, a hysterectomized monkey was treated with EB followed by combined EB and progesterone treatment. The PRL response was not different from that of intact monkeys similarly treated. From these findings we conclude 1) that the estrogen-progesterone synergy promoting PRL secretion is not of endometrial origin; 2) that approximately 1 week of estrogen priming is required for progesterone to induce PRL secretion; 3) and that the mode of action of estrogen is not dose dependent, but, rather, is a threshold effect.
Cisplatin is commonly used as a chemotherapeutic agent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it cannot satisfactorily improve the survival rate for patients with advanced HCC due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance caused by multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). To clarify whether or not glycyrrhizin and lamivudine have modulator effects on HCC treated with cisplatin, we established a cisplatin-resistant Huh7 HCC cell line and analyzed the mRNA expression of MRPs in the resistant cells. The resistant cells showed 14.1-fold higher resistance to cisplatin, and they expressed higher levels of MRP2 (6.29-fold), MRP3 (3.2-fold), MRP4 (11.3-fold) and MRP5 (3.39-fold) mRNAs than the wild-type cells by using real-time PCR. However, MRP1, MDR1 and GST-pi mRNA were not induced. Compared with the treatment of the resistant cells with cisplatin only, co-treatment with cisplatin and glycyrrhizin or lamivudine significantly decreased the cell viability to 76.8% and 79.5%, respectively. Co-treatment with cisplatin and both glycyrrhizin and lamivudine further decreased the cell viability to 65.1%. Intracellular concentration of cisplatin in the resistant cells decreased to 36.4% of that of the wild-type cells while it increased to 47.7% or 48.4% when glycyrrhizin or lamivudine were added separately, or 60% when they were added together. Our findings indicate the following: i) high expression of MRP2, MRP3, MRP4 and MRP5 decreases cisplatin accumulation in cisplatin-resistant HCC cells and contributes to cisplatin resistance; ii) glycyrrhizin and/or lamivudine accumulate cisplatin in resistant cells by inhibiting the cisplatin efflux from the cells; and iii) glycyrrhizin and lamivudine both act as modulators and have the effect of reversing cisplatin resistance, and co-treatment with glycyrrhizin and lamivudine enhances modulator activity in reversing the cisplatin resistance.
The neurotoxic effects of some of the more recent chemotherapeutic drugs are not well studied. Adriamycin is such a drug, used in the treatment of some cancers in both children and adults. An examination of its effects on the peripheral nervous system was therefore undertaken particularly in view of its use in children. Sprague-Dawley rats, 1 week of age, were injected with a subcutaneous injection of adriamycin (10 mg/kg/wt.). Cervical dorsal root ganglia were removed and prepared for quantitative study at the light microscopic level. Quantitative analysis of neuronal counts of the ganglia showed a statistically significant loss (P less than 0.001) of sensory neurons in the treated rats. The remaining neurons displayed many abnormal morphological features suggestive of a degenerative process. From this study, functional loss cannot be correlated to neuronal type but the significant loss of neurons and numbers of affected cells observed would have a serious effect on sensory function.
We report a case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis as a manifestation of propylthiouracil hypersensitivity.
A 66-year-old woman with a history of a toxic adenoma was referred for evaluation of a purpuric rash on the legs and buttocks bilaterally. She was biochemically hyperthyroid. Biopsy of the skin lesions revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Propylthiouracil therapy was discontinued, and methimazole started. The purpuric rash resolved and surgical treatment for toxic adenoma resulted in euthyroid state.
This report indicated that leukocytoclastic vasculitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with a vasculitic rash. The discontinuation of the propylthiouracil was associated with disappearance of the lesions.
The first German patient with achalasia-microcephaly syndrome is described. The mother was exposed to the anti-malarial drug Mefloquine during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.
There are many lines of evidence illustrating that iron plays a pivotal role in modulating the battle for survival between mammalian hosts and their pathogens. Each displays considerable genetic investment in a wide range of mechanisms for acquiring and maintaining iron. These competitive mechanisms are highly complex, existing within an interacting matrix of absorption, transport, storage and detoxification systems, each of which are iron-responsive and thus able to adapt to the different phases of infection. Considerable genetic polymorphism in some of these systems, with signals of geographic selection in the hosts, and niche selection in the pathogens, indicates that they are critical for species survival. In this review we briefly summarize the role of iron in host immune function before reviewing the available evidence that iron modulates susceptibility and disease outcomes in HIV and TB (tuberculosis). We then examine the putative role of iron-related host genes by focussing on two candidate genes, haptoglobin and NRAMP1, for which there are common polymorphic variants in humans with strong evidence of functionally distinct biochemical phenotypes that would be predicted to influence the course of HIV and TB infections. Finally, we examine the limited evidence so far available that nutrient-gene interactions are likely to influence the way in which gene variants can protect against infection. We conclude that there is a wealth of evidence associating alterations in iron balance and in iron-regulatory systems with disease progression, but that many issues related to the direction of causality, mechanisms of action and sensitivity to pharmacological intervention remain to be elucidated. Since iron is probably the most widely prescribed compound throughout the world, used in both preventative and treatment regimens, a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions relating to iron constitutes an important area for both basic and clinical research.
The effects of the selective beta2-receptor stimulator terbutaline (0-25 to 0-5 mg given intravenously) on myometrial activity, local uterine blood flow, and lower abdominal pain were examined during the first day of menstruation in 11 women with severe primary dysmenorrhoea. All had maximum intrauterine pressures between 200 and 350 mm Hg. During uterine contractions of high amplitude or long duration, the local endometrial blood flow decreased markedly, and the patients experienced the most intense pain. Terbutaline inhibited the myometrial activity, increased the blood flow, and relieved the pain.
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis occurred in a woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had been treated with D-penicillamine for 3 months. Light microscopy study of the kidney showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 50% of glomeruli and necrotizing vasculitis. Immunoflurescence revealed IgA and C3 granular deposits diffusely distributed along the capillary walls. The patient was treated with steroid 'pulse', antiplatelet agents and heparin and a partial recovery of renal function was observed after 2 months of anuria. This renal picture is unlike that reported in RA and a causative role for D-penicillamine is suggested.
Tetrahydropapaveroline (THP) is formed in Parkinsonian patients receiving L-DOPA therapy and is detected in the plasma and urine of these patients. In this study, we have investigated the effects of THP on L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat adrenal pheochromocytoma, PC12 cells. Exposure of PC12 cells up to 10 microM THP or 20 microM L-DOPA after 24 or 48 hr, neither affected the cell viability determined by MTT assay, nor induced apoptosis by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. However, at concentrations higher than 15 microM, THP showed cytotoxicity through an apoptotic process. In addition, THP at 5-15 microM for both incubation time points significantly enhanced L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity (L-DOPA concentration, 50 microM). Exposure of PC12 cells to THP, L-DOPA and THP plus L-DOPA for 48 hr resulted in a marked increase in the cell loss and percentage of apoptotic cells compared with exposure for 24hr. The enhancing effects of THP on L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity were concentration- and treated-time-dependent. THP, L-DOPA and THP plus L-DOPA produced a significant increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and decrease in ATP levels, supporting the involvement of oxidative stress in THP- and L-DOPA-induced apoptosis. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine strongly inhibited changes in apoptosis, decreases in cell viability and ROS generation induced by THP associated with L-DOPA. These results suggest that THP aggravates L-DOPA-induced oxidative neurotoxic and apoptotic effects in PC12 cells. Therefore, Parkinsonian patients treated with L-DOPA for long-term need to be monitored for the relationship between plasma concentration of THP and the symptoms of neurotoxicity.
Maternal cadmium exposure induces fetal growth restriction (FGR), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The placenta is the main organ known to protect the fetus from environmental toxins such as cadmium. In this study, we examine the role of the two key placental factors in cadmium-induced FGR. The first is placental enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2), which is known to protect the fetus from exposure to high cortisol levels and subsequently FGR, and the second the cadmium binding/sequestering proteins metallotheionein (MT)-I and -II. Using the MT-I/II(-/-) mouse model, pregnant mice were administered cadmium, following which pups and placentas were collected and examined. MT-I/II(-/-) pups exposed to cadmium were significantly growth restricted, but neither placental weight nor 11β-HSD2 was altered. Although cadmium administration did not result in any visible structural changes in the placenta, increased apoptosis was detected in MT-I/II(-/-) placentas following cadmium exposure, with a significant increase in levels of both p53 and caspase 3 proteins. Additionally, glucose transporter (GLUT1) was significantly reduced in MT-I/II(-/-) placentas of pups exposed to cadmium, whereas zinc transporter (ZnT-1) remained unaltered. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MT-I/II(-/-) mice are more vulnerable to cadmium-induced FGR. The present data also suggest that increased apoptosis and reduced GLUT1 expression in the placenta contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced FGR.
Sirolimus is a new and potent immunosuppressive agent. Recently, increased proteinuria has been recognized as an important complication. However, the mechanism thereof has remained unclear. We describe a patient who received sirolimus as standard therapy after living donor kidney transplantation. Within 10 days the patient developed a severe proteinuria that disappeared completely after substituting tacrolimus for sirolimus. Renal biopsy disclosed normal glomeruli even without effacement of the podocytic foot processes. Using FITC labeled anti-albumin antibodies we noted complete absence of albumin in the proximal tubules, whereas an abundant albumin staining was observed in a control patient with a comparable level of proteinuria due to a recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis after transplantation. Our data suggest that sirolimus can induce severe proteinuria, and that reduced tubular protein reabsorption contributes to the protein loss.
Rectal biopsies from five patients with clindamycin-associated colitis were studied with the intention of identifying fibrin thrombi in capillaries. Capillary thrombosis was present in all five cases, three with pseudomembranous colitis and two with non-specific colitis. The significance of capillary thrombosis and its relationship to other ischaemic lesions of the gut are discussed.
Spreading depression was characterized in adult rats rendered epileptic by pilocarpine (350 mg/kg, i.p.) and thereafter made hyperglycemic with (i.p.) 60 mg/kg streptozotocin. Groups treated with only one of the above drugs, as well as control groups treated with their vehicles (saline and citrate buffer, respectively) were also studied. The animals treated with pilocarpine or streptozotocin presented, as a common feature, a reduction in the spreading depression propagation rate. However, they differed by the fact that pilocarpine, in some cases, blocked spreading depression propagation, whereas streptozotocin did not block it at all. In early-malnourished animals, streptozotocin-effects, but not pilocarpine-effects on spreading depression were attenuated. The treatment with both drugs did not potentiate their individual reducing effects on spreading depression propagation, irrespective of the animals' early nutritional status. These results extend previous observations on rats treated with both drugs separately, confirming their impairing action on spreading depression propagation. They also indicate that early malnutrition is more effective in changing the streptozotocin effects on spreading depression, as compared to the pilocarpine-effects. Since such effects were observed at adulthood, they indicate that the early malnutrition-induced cortical changes responsible for the here-described effects are long-lasting.
Increasing evidence has demonstrated that propylthiouracil (PTU) could induce ANCA positive vasculitis. However, our previous work has suggested that only one-fifth of the PTU-induced ANCA positive patients had clinical vasculitis and so the mechanism is not clear. Anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various vasculitides, including primary ANCA positive systemic vasculitis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of AECA and their possible role in the pathogenesis of patients with PTU-induced ANCA positive vasculitis. Sera from 11 patients with PTU-induced ANCA positive vasculitis at both active and quiescent phases, and sera from 10 patients with PTU-induced ANCA but without clinical vasculitis, were studied. Sera from 30 healthy blood donors were collected as normal controls. Soluble proteins from 1% Triton-100 extracted in vitro cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used as antigens and an immunoblotting technique was performed to determine the presence of AECA, and their specific target antigens were identified. In patients with PTU-induced ANCA positive vasculitis, 10 of the 11 patients in an active phase of disease were serum IgG-AECA positive and six protein bands of endothelial antigens could be blotted (61 kD, 69 kD, 77 kD, 85 kD, 91 kD and 97 kD). However, in the quiescent phase, seven of the 10 positive sera turned negative. None of the ANCA positive but vasculitis negative patients or normal controls were AECA positive. In conclusion, AECA could be found in sera from patients with PTU-induced ANCA positive vasculitis and were associated more closely with vasculitic disease activity.
