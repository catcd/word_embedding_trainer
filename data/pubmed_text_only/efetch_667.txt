Alteration of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is known to be an early event in neoplasia, causing activation of the beta-catenin / Tcf pathway. Although it is thought that alterations in APC and beta- catenin may complement one another, the contribution of beta-catenin mutations to colorectal carcinogenesis remains unclear. We therefore performed PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of exon 3 of beta-catenin gene in adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and aberrant crypt foci (ACF), considered to be putative precursor lesions of colorectal neoplasias, in 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) treated F344 rats. beta-Catenin mutations were identified in all of 7 adenomas (100%) and 6 of 12 (50%) adenocarcinomas. All of the mutations were found in codons 32 through 34, the serine encoded by codon 33 being an important phosphorylation site by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Regarding ACF, 14 of 46 (30.4%) were found to be mutated, eleven (78%) in codon 34, and the others in codon 45 (frequently altered in human colon cancer), and codons 47 and 56 (which have not been previously reported). The frequency of beta-catenin mutations in adenomas was significantly higher than in ACF (P < 0.001) and adenocarcinomas (P < 0.05). Thus, beta-catenin mutations may have more importance in the genesis of adenomas than ACF or adenocarcinomas in rat colon carcinogens by PhIP.
Morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G), a major metabolite of morphine, is reported to be more potent than morphine when administered intrathecally; however, its efficiency remains under debate when administered intravenously. This study was designed to assess the analgesic efficiency of intravenous M-6-G for the treatment of acute postoperative pain.
After informed consent was obtained, 37 adults (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II) who were scheduled for elective open knee surgery were enrolled in the study. General anesthesia was induced with thiopental, alfentanil, and vecuronium and was maintained with a mixture of nitrous oxide/isoflurane and bolus doses of alfentanil. At skin closure, patients were randomized into three groups: (1) morphine group (n = 13), which received morphine 0.15 mg/kg; (2) M-6-G group (n = 12), which received M-6-G 0.1 mg/kg; and (3) placebo group (n = 12), which received saline. At the time of extubation, plasma concentration of morphine and M-6-G was measured. Postoperative analgesic efficiency was assessed by the cumulative dose of morphine delivered by patient-controlled analgesia. Opioid-related side effects were also evaluated.
No difference was noted in patient characteristics and opioid-related side effects. Morphine requirements (mean +/- SD) during the first 24 h in the M-6-G group (41+/-9 mg) and the placebo group (49+/-8 mg) were significantly greater (P<0.05) compared with the morphine group (29+/-8 mg).
A single intravenous bolus dose of M-6-G was found to be ineffective in the treatment of acute postoperative pain. This might be related to the low permeability of the blood-brain barrier for M-6-G.
Intrathecal (IT) opioid and local anesthetic combinations are popular for labor analgesia because of rapid, effective pain relief, but the duration of analgesia is limited. This study was undertaken to determine whether the addition of clonidine and neostigmine to IT bupivacaine-fentanyl would increase the duration of analgesia without increasing side effects for patients in labor.
Forty-five healthy parturients in active labor were randomized to receive a 2-ml IT dose of one of the following dextrose-containing solutions using the combined spinal-epidural technique: (1) bupivacaine 2.5 mg and fentanyl 25 microg (BF); (2) BF plus clonidine 30 microg (BFC); or (3) BFC plus neostigmine 10 microg (BFCN). Pain, sensory levels, motor block, side effects, maternal vital signs, and fetal heart rate were systematically assessed.
Patients administered BFCN had significantly longer analgesia (165+/-32 min) than those who received BF (90+/-21 min; P<0.001) or BFC (123+/-21 min; P<0.001). Pain scores, block characteristics, maternal vital signs, Apgar scores, maternal satisfaction, and side effects were similar among groups except for nausea, which was significantly greater in the BFCN group (P<0.05 as compared with BFC).
The addition of clonidine and neostigmine significantly increased the duration of analgesia from IT bupivacaine-fentanyl during labor, but neostigmine caused more nausea. Although serious side effects were not observed in this study, safety must be further addressed before the routine use of multiple IT drugs is advocated.
The objective of the study was to evaluate the anticataleptic effect of Withania somnifera (WS) extract, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in albino mice. Catalepsy was induced with haloperidol (1 mg/kg) i.p. in five groups of male albino mice (n = 6). Three groups received Withania somnifera extract (1.7, 4.25, 8.5 mg/kg) respectively, one group received scopolamine (1 mg/kg) and one group received the vehicle (1% gum acacia) orally, 30 min prior to haloperidol administration. Catalepsy was measured by using standard bar test at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 240 min. This constituted the acute study. For the chronic study, the drugs were administered for 6 more days. Catalepsy was again measured on day 7. Animals were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was estimated in the brain. In this study, Withania somnifera extract treated groups showed a dose dependent reduction in cataleptic scores, both in the acute and chronic study. The SOD activity in brain was also found to be lowered in the WS (4.25 mg, 8.5 mg/kg) treated groups. In conclusion, Withania somnifera was found to be more efficacious than scopolamine in reversing haloperidol induced catalepsy. A clear correlation between the SOD levels and cataleptic scores was observed. We believe that the antioxidant properties of this drug could have contributed to the anticataleptic effect.
Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of a variety of human solid tumors. However, its clinical use is limited due to severe toxicity. The pathogenesis of liver damage caused by cisplatin is generally considered to be oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of the ethanol extract of Prunus persica flesh (PPFE) against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in animal models. In a xenograft model with the repeated administration of a low-dose cisplatin (5 mg/kg body weight) for 15 days, and in an acute toxicity model with a single administration of a high-dose cisplatin (45 mg/kg body weight) over a 16 h period, the consecutive administration of PPFE in combination with and prior to the cisplatin injection reversed the cisplatin-induced decrease in the liver weight as a percentage of total body weight, and the cisplatin-induced increases in the serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels caused by liver damage. Moreover, the oral administration of PPFE significantly recovered the reduced glutathione level and inhibited lipid peroxidation in the cisplatin-treated mice. These results demonstrate that supplementation with PPFE might protect against cisplatin-induced toxicity in cancer patients.
The diagnostic accuracy of the dipyridamole test in provoking coronary insufficiency was investigated in 79 patients with chest pain and the results were compared with the findings on angiography and exercise electrocardiogram. 58 patients had documented severe coronary artery stenosis, 21 had patent coronary vessels (cardiomyopathy 8, aortic stenosis 1, ectopic origin of coronary artery 1, normal 11). Anginal pain after dipyridamole was a non-specific finding. Approximately half the subjects in whom coronary insufficiency would be expected according to the coronary angiographic and ventriculographic findings evidenced ischaemic ST-segment depression after dipyridamole, which was comparable to the number of positive exercise electrocardiograms. In 23 patients, most of whom had shown an inadequate frequency response during the initial exercise test, ergometry was repeated after the administration of dipyridamole. This resulted in an increase in ischaemic ECG response from 26 to 70%. It is concluded that a stress test combining dipyridamole and submaximum exercise increases the incidence of ischaemic ST-segment depression in comparison with ergometry alone. Anginal pain without ST-segment depression proved to be without diagnostic value.
Here we selected HgCl(2) to investigate the mechanism of Hg toxicity on reproduction in hermaphrodite nematodes. Accompanied with decrease of brood size, Hg exposure caused severe deficits in egg number in uterus, egg laying and reproductive structures, including gonad arms and vulva, and formation of protruding phenotype for vulva. Meanwhile, Hg exposure induced severe stress response and oxidative damage in gonad and vulva. Pre-treatment with vitamin E, a potent antioxidant, at the L2-larval stage prevented the oxidative damage and formation of reproductive deficits in Hg exposed nematodes; however, pre-treatment with paraquat, a regent generating superoxide anions, induced more severe reproductive deficits in Hg exposed nematodes. Moreover, Hg exposure increased expression of clk-2 and isp-1 genes, whose mutations decrease ROS production, and decreased expression of mev-1 and gas-1 genes, whose mutations increase ROS production. Thus, oxidative stress may be essential for the induction of reproductive deficits in Hg exposed hermaphrodite nematodes.
A 48-year-old woman, who had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), developed normochromic normocytic anemia after receiving clomipramine hydrochloride. Her reticulocyte count was low, and a bone marrow aspirate revealed erythroid hypoplasia without involvement of other cell lines. Thus a diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was made. The anemia gradually resolved following withdrawal of the drug. Although several drugs are known to cause PRCA, this is the first time that clomipramine hydrochloride has been reported to have such an effect. The underlying SLE in this case suggested the possible immunological pathogenesis of drug-induced PRCA.
To describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of indinavir with or without low-dose ritonavir in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Thai patients.
Thirty-six HIV-1-infected patients who participated in HIV-NAT 005 study gave informed consent to record a pharmacokinetic curve 4 weeks after starting a regimen containing either indinavir 800 mg every 8 h (n = 19) or indinavir 800 mg + ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (n = 17). Indinavir plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods.
The median (interquartile range; IQR) body weight of the 36 patients (11 females and 25 males) was 60 (54-72) kg. Median and IQR values for indinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin were 20.9 (13.1-27.0) mg x h/L, 8.1 (6.6-9.4) mg/L and 0.13 (0.09-0.27) mg/L, respectively, for indinavir 800 mg every 8 h, and 49.2 (42.5-60.4) mg x h/L, 10.6 (8.5-13.2) mg/L and 0.68 (0.43-0.77) mg/L, respectively, for indinavir 800 mg + ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h. These values are not largely different from values found in Caucasian patients, with the exception of relatively high peak levels of indinavir in Thai subjects. Cut-off values for optimal virological efficacy were an indinavir Cmin of 0.10 and 0.25 mg/L for the every 8 h and the every 12 h regimen, respectively; patients with an indinavir AUC greater than 30 (every 8 h regimen) or 60 (every 12 h regimen) mg x h/L were at increased risk of developing nephrotoxicity.
Indinavir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in Thai HIV-1-infected patients are similar to those described in Caucasian patients, despite an overall lower body weight in this population
Catalepsy and changes in striatal and limbic dopamine metabolism were investigated in mice after oral administration of aripiprazole, haloperidol, and risperidone. Catalepsy duration decreased with chronic (21 day) aripiprazole compared with acute (single dose) treatment across a wide dose range, whereas catalepsy duration persisted with chronic haloperidol treatment. At the time of maximal catalepsy, acute aripiprazole did not alter neostriatal dopamine metabolite/dopamine ratios or homovanillic acid (HVA) levels, and produced small increases in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). Effects were similar in the olfactory tubercle. Dopamine metabolism was essentially unchanged in both regions after chronic aripiprazole. Acute treatments with haloperidol or risperidone elevated DOPAC, HVA, and metabolite/dopamine ratios in both brain areas and these remained elevated with chronic treatment. The subtle effects of aripiprazole on striatal and limbic dopamine metabolism, and the decrease in catalepsy with chronic administration, illustrate fundamental differences in dopamine neurochemical actions and behavioral sequelae of aripiprazole compared to haloperidol or risperidone.
5-Hydroxy-5-(4'-chlorophenyl-2, 3-dihydro-5H-imidazo (2, 1-a)isoindole (mazindol), a novel tricyclic compound, has been shown to suppress food consumption in rats at doses causing weak central stimulation and little effects on blood pressure or heart rate. The substance produces dose-related decreases in the consumption of orange juice in cebus monkeys trained on an operant behavior schedule. The compound did not alter cardiac or pulmonary hemodynamics in the anesthetized dog but provided potentiation of norepinephrine pressor responses. Mazindol also demonstrated potent but incomplete antagonism of reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice, antagonism of tetrabenazine catalepsy in rats, and suppression of mouse-killing behavior of rats. Suppression of mouse-killing was reduced by lesions placed in the septal area of the brain. Brain monoamine oxidase or catechol-o-methyl-transferase activities were not altered, although preliminary experiments showed that mazindol reduced uptake of norepinephrine in brain tissue.
We characterized spontaneous and mecamylamine-precipitated nicotine withdrawal using intravenous nicotine self-administration, the acoustic startle response, prepulse inhibition and somatic signs of withdrawal in DBA/2J mice. Nicotine dependence was induced by continuous nicotine infusion through osmotic minipumps. Nicotine self-administration was studied before and after the induction of dependence. The initial test revealed significant nicotine self-administration at the 0.048 microg/infusion dose. During the second self-administration test, saline-treated mice exhibited increased aversiveness of response-contingent infusions of high nicotine doses; these changes were not seen in the nicotine-treated animals reflecting tolerance to nicotine's effects. Neither mecamylamine administration nor spontaneous withdrawal affected the expression of somatic signs, except that increases in jumping were observed during spontaneous withdrawal. Finally, nicotine withdrawal increased general activity in the startle chambers when no stimuli were presented, possibly reflecting increased body tremor and/or agitation, and decreased prepulse inhibition reflecting a sensorimotor gating deficit; the last two effects were reversed by nicotine self-administration. Thus, nicotine withdrawal results in modest, but yet detectable, changes in the behavior of mice.
The scandal of melamine-contamination has not been quite blown out, since the toxicity of melamine continues to raise concerns for public health. It has been well known that fetus and infant periods play the most important roles in brain development, whereas little has been done on the harmful effects of melamine on the center nervous system (CNS) of children. In the present study, we investigated the effects of melamine on behavioral and electrophysiology alternations in rats, and the effects of melamine on synaptic transmission were examined using whole-cell patch-clamp technique in the hippocampal CA1 neurons of infant rats. Morris water maze (MWM) test showed that learning and memory abilities were impaired significantly by melamine. The long-time potentiation (LTP) test exhibited that the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes were significantly lower in melamine group compared to that in control group. Furthermore, the data of whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that melamine decreased the frequencies of both spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) and minitura EPSCs (mEPSCs) to the same extent (about 76% and 78% respectively). However, there were no significant changes in sEPSC or mEPSC amplitude or kinetics after melamine addition, indicating that the effect of melamine on glutamatergic transmission was probably presynaptic. In conclusion, melamine reduced the release of glutamate in presynaptic transmission of hippocampus, which partly resulted in diminished LTP and further damaged the function of learning and memory.
The distribution of intracellular keratin proteins was examined in a variety of urinary bladder lesions of the rat using the immunoperoxidase staining technique. In ethanol-fixed sections, the normal epithelium was strongly positive for keratin staining. Focal regenerative hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium induced by freezing exhibited relatively weak staining. However, diffuse regenerative hyperplasia induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (CP) showed an intensely positive reaction throughout the epithelium. Of the sections fixed with Bouin's solution, the staining reaction was drastically reduced in the normal bladder and the staining was totally negative in the regenerative hyperplasia caused by freezing. Simple hyperplasia induced by a 4-week feeding of N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide (FANFT) as 0.2% of the diet exhibited strong reactivity, and nodular and papillarly hyperplasia induced by a 10-week feeding of FANFT was also positive for keratin throughout the lesions. In contrast to the preneoplastic lesions, FANFT-induced transitional cell carcinoma showed differential staining within the tumors. These results suggest that different keratin expression is involved in the proliferative bladder lesions induced mechanically by freezing and chemically by CP or by the carcinogen FANFT.
Pregnant Fischer 344 rats and New Zealand white rabbits were exposed to 2-ethoxyethanol acetate (EEA; CAS No. 111-15-9) vapor by inhalation on Gestational Days 6 through 15 (rats) or 6 through 18 (rabbits) at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, or 300 ppm, 6 hr/day. The animals were terminated on Gestational Day 21 (rats) or 29 (rabbits) and fetuses were examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations and variations. In rabbits, exposure to 100-300 ppm resulted in maternal toxicity: decreased weight gain at 100-300 ppm, clinical signs at 200-300 ppm, alterations in hematology at 100-300 ppm, reduced gravid uterine weight at termination at 200-300 ppm, and elevated absolute liver weight at 300 ppm. Developmental toxicity was observed at 100-300 ppm: an increased incidence of totally resorbed litters at 200-300 ppm, an increase in nonviable fetuses at 300 ppm, and a decrease in viable implants (live fetuses) per litter at 200-300 ppm. The incidence of fetal malformations (external, visceral, and skeletal) was increased at 200-300 ppm. The incidence of total malformations was 100% at 300 ppm and significantly increased at 200 ppm. Reduced fetal ossification was observed at 100-300 ppm. In rats, exposure to 100-300 ppm also resulted in maternal toxicity: reduced weight gain and reduced food consumption at 200-300 ppm and elevated relative liver weight and alterations in hematology at 100-300 ppm. Absolute maternal liver weight was increased at all EEA exposure concentrations; relative liver weight was increased at 100-300 ppm. Developmental toxicity was observed at 100-300 ppm: increased nonviable implantations/litter (300 ppm), reduced fetal body weight/litter (200-300 ppm), and increased incidence of external (300 ppm), visceral, and skeletal (100-300 ppm) variations indicative of toxicity. The incidence of visceral, skeletal, and total malformations was increased at 200-300 ppm. In conclusion, in both species, inhalation exposure to EEA during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity at 100-300 ppm and developmental toxicity at 100-300 ppm, including teratogenicity at 200-300 ppm. At 50 ppm in both species, there was no evidence of maternal or developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity.
The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and non-peptide blocker of AT1 receptors losartan on endothelial function of the shoulder artery in patients with congestive cardiac insufficiency. The examination covered 96 patients (mean age 46.71 +/- 4.13) with stable effort angina (functional class II-III) and circulatory insufficiency (NYHA functional class II-III) having end-diastolic left-ventricular volume > 160 ml, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, sinus rhythm, cardiothoracal index > 0.55 units. Patients with fibrillar tachyarrhythmia, high grade blocks, pacemaker migration, artificial pacemaker, myocardial infarction were not included in the trial. The patients were randomized into 3 groups 32 patients each. In addition to basic therapy patients of group 1 received long-acting nitrates, digoxin, aspirin and furosemide; group 2--enalapril in daily dose 10 mg; group 3--losartan in daily dose 25 mg. A course of treatment lasted 12 weeks. Endothelial function was assessed by high resolution echography, dopplerography performed before and after temporary occlusion of the shoulder artery and sublingual nitroglycerin. In patients with cardiac insufficiency, accelerated blood flow in the shoulder artery after its temporary occlusion promoted realization of the vasoconstrictory reaction. This was verified as endothelial dysfunction. In the course of the treatment all the patients achieved insignificant increase of the shoulder artery initial diameter. After sublingual intake of nitroglycerin vasodilation was also insignificant. 12-week enalapril and losartan prevented vasoconstriction in the shoulder artery in response to quicker circulation following arterial occlusion. However, higher maximal flow speed did not correspond to the increment in the artery diameter after the occlusion in any group. The flow-induced vasodilation was more pronounced in the enalapril group. Losartan group had a trend to an increase in the inner diameter of the shoulder artery. It is shown that enalapril and losartan in congestive cardiac insufficiency improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation caused by nitroglycerin. Enalapril demonstrated stronger ability than losartan to reverse endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiac insufficiency resultant from ischemic heart disease.
Pancreatitis is a common and potentially lethal necro-inflammatory disease with both acute and chronic manifestations. Current evidence suggests that the accumulated damage incurred during repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis (AP) can lead to chronic disease, which is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. While parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) exerts multiple effects in normal physiology and disease states, its function in pancreatitis has not been previously addressed. Here we show that PTHrP levels are transiently elevated in a mouse model of cerulein-induced AP. Treatment with alcohol, a risk factor for both AP and chronic pancreatitis (CP), also increases PTHrP levels. These effects of cerulein and ethanol are evident in isolated primary acinar and stellate cells, as well as in the immortalized acinar and stellate cell lines AR42J and irPSCc3, respectively. Ethanol sensitizes acinar and stellate cells to the PTHrP-modulating effects of cerulein. Treatment of acinar cells with PTHrP (1-36) increases expression of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6) and intracellular adhesion protein (ICAM-1), suggesting a potential autocrine loop. PTHrP also increases apoptosis in AR42J cells. Stellate cells mediate the fibrogenic response associated with pancreatitis; PTHrP (1-36) increases procollagen I and fibronectin mRNA levels in both primary and immortalized stellate cells. The effects of cerulein and ethanol on levels of IL-6 and procollagen I are suppressed by the PTH1R antagonist, PTHrP (7-34). Together these studies identify PTHrP as a potential mediator of the inflammatory and fibrogenic responses associated with alcoholic pancreatitis.
Recent studies demonstrated that resveratrol, a grape-derived polyphenolic phytoalexin, provides pharmacological preconditioning (PC) of the heart through a NO-dependent mechanism. Because adenosine receptors play a role in PC, we examined whether they play any role in resveratrol PC. Rats were randomly assigned to groups perfused for 15 min with 1) Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB) only; 2) KHB containing 10 microM resveratrol; 3) 10 microM resveratrol + 1 microM 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT; adenosine A(1) receptor blocker); 4) 10 microM resveratrol + 1 microM 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC; adenosine A(2a) receptor blocker); 5) 10 microM resveratrol + 1 microM 3-ethyl-5-benzyl-2-methyl-4-phenylethynyl-6-phenyl-1,4-(+/-)-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate (MRS-1191; adenosine A(3) receptor blocker); or 6) 10 microM resveratrol + 3 microM 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride [LY-294002, phosphatidylinositol (PI)3-kinase inhibitor], and groups perfused with adenosine receptor blockers alone. Hearts were then subjected to 30-min ischemia followed by 2-h reperfusion. The results demonstrated significant cardioprotection with resveratrol evidenced by improved ventricular recovery and reduced infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. CPT and MRS 1191, but not CSC, abrogated the cardioprotective abilities of resveratrol, suggesting a role of adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptors in resveratrol PC. Resveratrol induced expression of Bcl-2 and caused its phosphorylation along with phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), Akt, and Bad. CPT blocked phosphorylation of Akt and Bad without affecting CREB, whereas MRS 1191 blocked phosphorylation of all compounds, including CREB. LY-294002 partially blocked the cardioprotective abilities of resveratrol. The results indicate that resveratrol preconditions the heart through activation of adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptors, the former transmitting a survival signal through PI3-kinase-Akt-Bcl-2 signaling pathway and the latter protecting the heart through a CREB-dependent Bcl-2 pathway in addition to an Akt-Bcl-2 pathway.
Azathioprine (AZA) is a commonly used immunosuppressant for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Myelosuppression is a serious adverse reaction due to AZA and its metabolites. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is the rate-limiting enzyme. Variations of TPMT enzyme activity may be responsible for myelosuppression. However, a correlation between certain mutant alleles of low TPMT enzyme activity and myelotoxicity has also been suggested as a factor. We describe herein a case of AZA-induced severe myelosuppression associated with TPMT*3C heterozygous mutant allele in a SLE patient. The patient presented with pancytopenia, sepsis, typhlitis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy after a short period of AZA therapy. The patient had low TPMT activity and TPMT*3C genotype. Measurement of TPMT activity and determination of TPMT variant allele may identify patients at risk for AZA-induced myelosuppression.
This report describes a case of encephalopathy developed in the course of amitriptyline therapy, during a remission of unipolar depression. This patient could have been diagnosed as having either neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome (SS). The major determinant of the symptoms may have been dopamine/serotonin imbalance in the central nervous system. The NMS-like encephalopathy that develops in association with the use of antidepressants indicates that NMS and SS are spectrum disorders induced by drugs with both antidopaminergic and serotonergic effects.
Benomyl is a benzimidazole fungicide that has been widely used on a variety of food crops and ornamental plants. It is known to cause adverse effects on reproductive systems, including decreased testicular and epididymal weights and reduced epididymal sperm counts and fertility. The brain aromatase gene is up-regulated by estrogens and estrogen mimics and considered a target gene to screen estrogen mimics. This study was designed to test the estrogenic potential and toxic effects of benomyl in the zebrafish system, and validated this system as a model that may correspond to the effect of benomyl in rodents. Concentrations of 20 x 10(-6), 40 x 10(-6) and 80 x 10(-6) M of benomyl-treated embryos showed decreased survival, hatching and heart rates, and increased incidence of malformations, such as pericardial edema, spinal lordosis, elongated heart, head edema, eye lens protrusion and caudal fin disappearance. Benomyl induced enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) in transient zebrafish embryos with a brain aromatase-based reporter gene. In this study, we determined that benomyl has estrogenic potential based on zebrafish brain aromatase gene induction, and that benomyl is toxic at 20 x 10(-6) M concentration and higher. These results demonstrate the usefulness of zebrafish embryos as an in vivo system to examine the estrogenic and developmental toxic potential of unknown compounds.
A case on concomitant atenolol-verapamil therapy for hypertension and angina pectoris, developing sinus arrest and life-threatening bradycardia is described. The complication occurred with low doses of both the agents and normal electrophysiologic status of the heart. The example suggests that pharmacodynamic synergism contributes more than pharmacokinetic interaction causing adverse reactions during beta blocker-verapamil therapy.
Iv injections of Adriamycin (0.375-3.0 mg/kg), rubidazone (0.75-6.0 mg/kg), or daunorubicin (0.75-6.0 mg/kg) given within 1 minute produced immediate hypotension in anesthetized beagle dogs. The threshold hypotensive dose for Adriamycin (0.375 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/m2) was lower than that for either rubidazone (0.75 mg/kg) or daunorubicin (1.5 mg/kg). Recovery from hypotension was more rapid after administration of rubidazone or daunorubicin than after Adriamycin. Adriamycin (1.5-3.0 mg/kg) caused respiratory distress and depressed mean arterial pressure an average of 54%-82% for up to 30 minutes. The hypotension was almost eliminated when the Adriamycin (1.5 mg/kg) infusion period was extended to 15 minutes. Significant increases in plasma histamine concentrations, coinciding with the peak hypotensive response, were detected within 1 minute after infusion of either Adriamycin (1.5 mg/kg) or rubidazone (1.5 mg/kg). Similar effects were noted after 6.0 mg/kg of daunorubicin. It appears that the acute cardiovascular effects of the three anthracycline compounds are mediated through release of histamine.
To study the natural history of the alterations in cardiac function produced by Adriamycin therapy, serial M-mode echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and systolic time intervals were obtained in 15 patients prior to Adriamycin therapy and at 3-month intervals during and 1 year after cessation of therapy. The echocardiographic E-point septal separation increased from a median 0 dose value of 0.40 cm to 0.70 cm (P less than 0.003) at the time of the maximum dose of Adriamycin. The electrocardiographic frontal plane voltage decreased 13% (P less than 0.008) and the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio increased from a median value of 0.37 to 0.40 (P less than 0.01) during this same period. During the first year after Adriamycin was discontinued, no significant change was noted in any of these values. Thus, as a group, the slight deterioration of ventricular function that occurred during Adriamycin therapy remained unimproved during the 1-year followup period.
It is well known that heavy oil (HO) on the sea surface causes serious problems in the aquatic environment. In particular, some species of teleosts which develop on the sea surface are thought to be affected by the HO which flows out from tankers or coastal industry. However, the toxicological effects of HO are not fully understood. We performed exposure experiments using the Pleuronectiformean fish, spotted halibut (Verasper variegatus), which is an important fishery resource in Japan. In course of the development, HO-exposed embryos showed remarkable delay in developmental processes including somite formation. We further observed abnormal development of the head morphology. Notably, treated embryos had relatively small eyes and craniofacial structures. These findings strongly suggest that HO seriously affects the cell proliferation and differentiation of the embryo. In addition, HO-exposed embryos showed abnormal neuronal development. We also performed the exposure in the larval stage. Treatment of post-hatching larvae with HO resulted in significantly greater mortality compared with controls. Through these observations, we finally conclude that HO is strongly toxic to halibut in their early life stages.
Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), a prodrug stimulant, is indicated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children 6-12 years of age and in adults. In short-term studies, once-daily LDX provided efficacy throughout the day. This study presented here was conducted to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of LDX in 6- to 12-year-olds with ADHD.
This open-label, multicenter, single-arm study enrolled children with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision criteria for ADHD. Following 1-week screening and washout periods, subjects were titrated to LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg/day over 4 weeks and placed on maintenance treatment for 11 months. The ADHD Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale measured effectiveness.
Of 272 subjects receiving LDX, 147 completed the study. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and occurred during the first 4 weeks. There were no clinically meaningful changes in blood pressure or electrocardiographic parameters. From baseline to endpoint, mean ADHD Rating Scale scores improved by 27.2 points (P<.0001). Improvements occurred during each of the first 4 weeks, and were maintained throughout. Based on Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale scores, >80% of subjects at endpoint and >95% of completers at 12 months were rated "improved."
Long-term 30, 50, and 70 mg/day LDX was generally well tolerated and effective in children with ADHD.
Adriamycin cardiotoxicity was morphologically evaluated in mice treated iv ten times at three dose levels which were equal to fixed fractions of the LD50. Good correlation between the degenerative heart lesions, scored according to a nonparametric scoring system, and the doses was found and allowed calculation of a median cumulative cardiotoxic dose of 36.4 mg/kg of body weight (121.5 mg/m2). The method is suitable for quantitative screening of the potential cardiotoxicity of new anthracycline analogs under standardized conditions.
