The first reported case of congestive cardiac failure in a child with Addison's disease secondary to fludrocortisone therapy is presented. A renal adaptation to compensate for chronic salt and water deprivation is suggested as a possible mechanism for the development of congestive cardiac failure in this patient.
Phenytoin has been implicated as a causative agent in peripheral neuropathy, although structural changes in nerve have not been characterized. A 47-year-old man was seen with clinical and electrophysiological signs of peripheral neuropathy after 30 years of phenytoin administration. Despite a modest dose of phenytoin (300 mg/day) blood levels were 31 to 38 micrograms/ml. A sural nerve biopsy showed a loss of large myelinated nerve fibers and a nonrandom clustered distribution of segmental demyelination and remyelination. The latter findings were accompanied by axonal shrinkage. Sixteen months after phenytoin was stopped, the patient's clinical and electrophysiological findings reflected improvement. These data indicate that long-term phenytoin administration can cause a reversible neuropathy characterized by axonal shrinkage and secondary demyelination.
Five patients were treated with pindolol for various indications. The patients called attention to the appearance of fine tremors in their extremities 6-72 hr after starting treatment with the drug. The tremors disappeared 24-72 hr after stopping the drug. Beta-adrenoceptor-blockers are known to suppress different types of tremor and the paradoxical appearance of tremors during pindolol treatment is attributed to its powerful partial agonist activity. To the best of the authors' knowledge this side effect has not been previously described in the literature.
Previous studies have documented that exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates prolactin (PRL) secretion and augments thyrotropin-releasing hormone-induced PRL release. Further, the concomitant pulsatile release of PRL and luteinizing hormone (LH) suggests that GnRH may be an important regulator of PRL release in certain physiologic states. The authors explored this possibility by evaluating the effect of a GnRH antagonist ([Ac-pClPhe1, pClPhe2, DTrp3, DAla10]-GnRH; GnRH-antagonist) on PRL secretion in monkeys with induced hyperprolactinemia. Monkeys were given estradiol (E2) benzoate 25 mg/kg intramuscularly (IM) on cycle days 1 to 28, and a 3-cm progesterone (P) silastic capsule was placed on cycle day 15 and removed on day 28. On cycle days 15 to 28, monkeys were given IM injections of 1 mg/kg GnRH-antagonist (n = 3), 2 mg/kg GnRH-antagonist (n = 3), or vehicle (n = 3). Daily blood samples were assayed for E2, P, and PRL. The degree of PRL elevation was calculated as percent increase in area under the curve for days 15 to 28 when compared with days 1 through 14 (baseline). Luteinizing hormone levels were calculated similarly. Results indicate a dose-dependent effect of GnRH-antagonist on PRL secretion, with the larger dose producing a significantly lower hyperprolactinemic response, as well as a decline in LH. Thus, GnRH-antagonist attenuates induced hyperprolactinemia in a dose similar to that which suppresses LH release. These findings suggest that GnRH is a physiologic regulator of pituitary PRL secretion. In addition, GnRH analogs may be of benefit in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation by attenuating gonadotropin-induced hyperprolactinemia, thereby reducing potential adverse effects on fertility.
To report a case of famciclovir-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV).
A 67-year-old white female presented to the hospital for evaluation of large, bilateral palpable purpura; coalescing ulcers with central eschars; and small, red violaceous papules on her legs and groin. Approximately 2 months prior to this hospitalization, the woman was diagnosed with shingles of her left T1-T2 nerve distribution and was treated with famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily, which was her first exposure to this medication. Her shingles resolved; however, on day 4 of treatment, she began to notice red spots on both of her legs that began to progressively blister and increase in size. She discontinued famciclovir at that time. The rash persisted and spread to her abdomen, groin, legs, feet, and toes. She underwent punch biopsy that revealed LCV. Workup was negative for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, hepatitis B and C virus, perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cytoplasmic-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens, proteinase 3, and myeloperoxidase. The patient improved with daily oral steroids and local wound care.
LCV has been reported only once before in the English literature as of January 2008. The most common cause of LCV is medication use, but it is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is hypothesized that drugs act as haptens, which cause an immune response. An objective causality assessment using the Naranjo probability scale suggested that famciclovir was the probable cause of LCV in this patient.
Healthcare professionals should be aware of the possible development of famciclovir-induced LCV.
To report a case of severe and recurrent crystalluria resulting from the use of indinavir and to review the literature describing this adverse effect.
A 26-year-old HIV-positive white woman had recurrent episodes of left-sided flank pain accompanied by dilation of the left renal collecting system while undergoing treatment with a triple-drug regimen including indinavir 1200 mg every 12 hours (full dosage). Typical indinavir crystalluria was observed, with no evidence of stones. Acute episodes were treated with intravenous fluids, diclofenac, and ciprofloxacin. Crystalluria and clinical symptoms eventually resolved with withdrawal of indinavir and substitution with a different protease inhibitor. Renal function remained normal.
A wide spectrum of disorders of the urinary tract can occur in subjects taking indinavir, with potentially severe complications caused by crystalluria and stones. Indinavir is excreted in the urine; the low solubility of those crystals is the critical factor accounting for the risk of stone formation. An elevated pH with a reduced excretion of citric acid contributes to the low urinary solubility of indinavir. Pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs, leading to elevated plasma concentrations of indinavir, and dehydration could also increase the risk of stone formation. The impact on renal function can be unfavorable over the long-term period. Cornerstones of treatment and prevention are increased fluid intake and possibly urinary acidification. Emergency drainage may be required for patients with severe obstruction. Reducing the dosage of indinavir has been proposed, but this carries the risk of viral mutations with development of resistance.
Treatment with indinavir can result in crystalluria with potentially severe obstruction. All patients taking indinavir, not only those with documented crystalluria or renal effects from the drug, should greatly increase their fluid intake and have renal function checked at baseline and then monitored regularly. Urinalysis also should be performed regularly for appropriate monitoring and prevention.
22 patients entered a double-blind trial to test the efficacy of bromocriptine therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease already established on conventional levodopa therapy. 3 patients on placebo withdrew when no improvement occurred and control became complicated. 4 patients on active drug withdrew because of various symptoms, but in only 1 case were these (nausea and vomiting) thought to be a real drug effect. Of the 15 patients who completed the trial, 9 were on active drug and 6 were on placebo. Although more than half the patients in each group were subjectively improved, measurement scales of functional disability and physical examination revealed no significant change in either group. Side effects encountered included nausea, dyskinesiae and hallucinations. It is concluded that bromocriptine does not offer any additional benefit in most patients with Parkinson's disease who are well stabilised on levodopa therapy, but may have a place in those patients who encounter side effects due to fluctuations in serum and tissue levels of levodopa.
Prolonged erection and priapism are common complications following intracavernosal injection of vasoactive agents in the management of erectile dysfunction. It is usually treated by intracorporeal drainage and irrigation with sympathomimetic agents. There is no established oral therapy . To study the effect of oral terbutaline on prolonged erection following intracavernosal injection of vasoactive agent, a controlled randomized study was done in 68 patients. Detumescence was achieved in 42 and 15% of the cases with oral terbutaline and placebo, respectively. Results of this study suggest that an initial trial with oral terbutaline for pharmacologically induced prolonged erection may be successful.
Hyperammonemic encephalopathy has been reported in patients receiving chemotherapy (CT). It is characterized by abrupt alteration in mental status with markedly elevated plasma ammonium levels in the absence of obvious liver disease. This paper reports seven patients who developed transient hyperammonemia during chemotherapy. The regimens all included continuous infusion of high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy was 1.5-4 days after the start of CT. Five cases had infection and six had prerenal azotemia at the time of hyperammonemia. After management, plasma ammonium levels all returned to the normal range within 2 days. Except for one persistent coma, status of consciousness cleared completely. The true mechanism of transient hyperammonemia is unclear. The excess production of ammonium due to metabolites of 5-FU added to precipitating factors such as infection, hypovolemia or constipation may be the explanation for transient hyperammonemia in our study.
Four patients with an absence status induced by drugs, are described. In three patients the use of neuroleptics was the probable cause, in the other indomethacin could be incriminated. As yet an absence status after treatment with these medicaments has not been described. Clinically, the diagnosis was not unequivocal. The EEG gave clear results, rapidly indicating the cause of the patient's clinical condition.
To estimate the incidence of and risks for bleeding and thromboembolic events after warfarin anticoagulation. We also explored the dosage and international normalized ratio (INR) among Chinese patients during long-term warfarin therapy.
The population in this retrospective study consisted of inpatients of the only medical center for northern Taipei City, whose initial course of warfarin therapy continued for more than four weeks. Enrollment began in June 1995 and ended in February 1996. Follow-up was completed in March 1998. Relevant data were collected by chart review. The rate of events was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and risk factors were identified by the Cox proportional hazard model.
During the study period, 226 patients were identified. The total follow-up time was 248.7 patient-years. Sixty-one patients (27.0%) received anticoagulation for mechanical prosthetic valve, but their duration of therapy accounted for 48.6% of the total patient-years of follow-up. The starting dosage (mean +/- SD) was 3.4+/-1.4 mg/d (range 1.3-10); the maintenance dosage was 3.1+/-1.2 mg/d (range 1.2-7.7). There were 1060 dosing adjustments and 3398 INR measurements collected for these patients. The independent determinants of maintenance dosage were age, body weight, and indication of mechanical prosthetic valve. The INR was 1.9+/-0.5 (range 1.0-3.7). The cumulative probabilities for hemorrhage at 12, 24, and 34 months were 24.5%, 32.3%, and 38.4%, respectively. The corresponding figures for thromboembolism were 8.5%, 10.7%, and 10.7%, respectively. Three hemorrhages were fatal. After adjusting for other patient characteristics, increasing age was the only independent risk factor identified for bleeding.
Antithrombotic efficacy seemed to be maintained, although the mean INR was 1.9. Even so, the substantial incidence of bleeding, especially fatal bleeding, remains a concern. Low-intensity anticoagulation might be needed for Chinese patients during long-term warfarin therapy.
We aimed to explore the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor in in vivo and in vitro models of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity.
Doxorubicin is one of the most potent antitumor agents available; however, its clinical use is limited because of the risk of severe cardiotoxicity. Endocannabinoids mediate cardiodepressive effects through CB1 receptors in various pathophysiological conditions, and these effects can be reversed by CB1 antagonists.
Left ventricular function was measured by Millar pressure-volume system. Apoptosis markers, CB1/CB2 receptor expression, and endocannabinoid levels were determined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, fluorescent microscopy, and liquid chromatography/in-line mass spectrometry techniques.
Five days after the administration of a single dose of DOX (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) to mice, left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum first derivative of ventricular pressure with respect to time (+dP/dt), stroke work, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and load-independent indexes of contractility (end-systolic pressure-volume relation, preload-recruitable stroke work, dP/dt-end-diastolic volume relation) were significantly depressed, and the myocardial level of the endocannabinoid anandamide (but not CB1/CB2 receptor expression) was elevated compared with vehicle-treated control mice. Treatment with the CB1 antagonists rimonabant or AM281 markedly improved cardiac dysfunction and reduced DOX-induced apoptosis in the myocardium. Doxorubicin also decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in the H9c2 myocardial cell line measured by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy, which were prevented by the preincubation of the cells with either CB1 antagonist, but not with CB1 and CB2 agonists and CB2 antagonists.
These data suggest that CB1 antagonists may represent a new cardioprotective strategy against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
To report on a 12-year-old white male with prostatic rhabdomyosarcoma who experienced episodes of syncope attributed to concurrent amitriptyline and fluconazole therapy, confirmed by readministration.
The patient began experiencing syncopal episodes periodically over a seven-month period. These repeated episodes occurred when fluconazole was administered for periodic mucositis secondary to chemotherapy. The patient had received fluconazole in the past with no difficulty and had been receiving a stable dose of amitriptyline for neuropathic pain. On discontinuation of amitriptyline, no further episodes were noted.
Concurrent administration of fluconazole with amitriptyline likely resulted in the decreased metabolism of amitriptytine. Three case reports presented in the literature of adults receiving concurrent amitriptyline and fluconazole have shown an increase in serum amitriptyline concentrations with concurrent administration of fluconazole; however, none of these patients were rechallenged. Literature available on amitriptyline overdose confirms that syncope and the adverse events noted in the case studies may result from elevated amitriptyline plasma concentrations.
The consistent presentation of syncope in our patient during readministration of amitriptytine and fluconazole strongly suggests a drug-drug interaction.
To report a patient having a first-time seizure after receiving venlafaxine and trimipramine for depression.
A 25-year-old white woman with chronic depression was treated with venlafaxine 150 mg/d and trimipramine 50 mg/d. Eleven days after increase of the trimipramine dosage to 100 mg/d, she was hospitalized because of seizures suggesting a secondary generalized grand-mal episode. The electroencephalogram showed a pathologic pattern with several generalized epileptiform discharges. Because of suspected drug-induced seizures, both antidepressants were stopped. After antidepressant drug cessation, the patient was symptom free and had no further seizure episodes within the following 12 months of follow-up. No other potential cause for the seizure episode could be identified.
Both venlafaxine and trimipramine have been associated with seizures, mainly after overdose. Venlafaxine-associated seizures at therapeutic doses have not been reported in the literature. We hypothesize that a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic drug interaction between venlafaxine and trimipramine involving the CYP2D6 isoenzyme may have played a role in inducing the seizures.
Clinicians should be aware of the proepileptogenic effect of venlafaxine and trimipramine at therapeutic doses and that this combination may eventually increase the risk of seizures.
Behavioral effects of terguride, a partial dopamine D2 agonist, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned parkinsonian cynomolgus monkeys were compared with those of the dopamine agonist apomorphine and the dopamine antagonist haloperidol. Terguride alone ameliorated the parkinsonism without inducing any sign of excitability, irritability, or aggressiveness (hyperactivity). Apomorphine alone also ameliorated the parkinsonism but induced marked hyperactivity. Haloperidol alone caused worsening of the parkinsonism, inducing transient eyelid closure. In combination with apomorphine, terguride suppressed the hyperactivity induced by apomorphine without reducing its antiparkinsonian effects. Pretreatment with haloperidol suppressed both the antiparkinsonian effects and the hyperactivity induced by apomorphine. Terguride thus exhibits both antiparkinsonian and antihyperactivity effects in a monkey model of Parkinson's disease, suggesting that terguride might be beneficial for treating motor dysfunction and dopaminergic psychosis in advanced Parkinson's disease.
This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of two different alpha(1)-adrenergic blockers on bladder hypertrophy using ultrasound-estimated bladder weight (UEBW) and to assess the relation between changes in UEBW and other objective and subjective parameters of disease severity in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
41 men were enrolled in the study and they were subjected to either watchful waiting (group 1) or alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor blocker therapy (group 2 with alfuzosin; group 3 with tamsulosin). The patients were investigated by symptom evaluation using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life score (QOL), uroflowmetry and UEBW. The parameters were assessed again 3 months after initiation of treatment and compared with the initial values.
While the mean UEBW increased in group 1 (42.2 +/- 10.3 to 52.5 +/- 12.2 g), it decreased in both the other groups that received alpha-blocker therapy (61.3 +/- 18.7 to 41.1 +/- 13.2 and 59.4 +/- 17.2 to 43.5 +/- 17.6 g, respectively). In groups 2 and 3, the mean UEBW, post-void residual urine, IPSS and QOL values decreased, and the mean maximum flow rate increased. All of the changes in group 2 and all except QOL in group 3 were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The changes correlated well with each other with regard to treatment success. The highest decreases in UEBW were encountered in patients with heavier bladders.
UEBW decreases with alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor blockers. When used together with the other objective and subjective parameters, UEBW is a promising quantitative parameter as a follow-up tool and can be useful in monitoring the therapeutic effects of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor blockers.
Lithium remains a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, but the mechanisms by which it prevents the recurrence of mood episodes are not known. The authors utilized data from a genomewide association study to examine associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the outcome of lithium treatment in two cohorts of patients with bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder.
The hazard for mood episode recurrence was examined among 1,177 patients with bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder, including 458 individuals treated with lithium carbonate or citrate, who were participants in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) cohort. SNPs showing the greatest evidence of association in Cox regression models were then examined for association with positive lithium response among 359 bipolar I or II disorder patients treated with lithium carbonate or citrate in a second cohort from the University College London.
The strongest association in the STEP-BD cohort (minimum p=5.5 x 10(-7)) was identified for a region on chromosome 10p15 (rs10795189). Of the regions showing suggestive evidence (p<5 x 10(-4)) of association with lithium response, five were further associated with positive lithium response in the University College London cohort, including SNPs in a region on chromosome 4q32 spanning a gene coding for the glutamate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolpropionate (AMPA) receptor GRIA2.
Multiple novel loci merit further examination for association with lithium response in bipolar disorder patients, including one region that spans the GRIA2 gene, for which expression has been shown to be regulated by lithium treatment.
We describe an elderly patient with chronic renal failure who developed bilateral exudative retinal detachments after initiation of systemic corticosteroid therapy, followed by prompt resolution of the retinal detachments after the corticosteroids were discontinued.
The medical record was examined and reviewed to document the clinical course, treatment, and therapeutic response.
Two weeks after receiving systemic corticosteroids for deteriorating renal failure, the patient had painless bilateral visual loss. Rapid tapering of the corticosteroids concurrent with hemodialysis and subsequent improvement of renal failure resulted in resolution of the exudative retinal detachments. The right eye developed a 360-degree retinal pigment epithelial tear in the macula.
Exudative retinal detachments may complicate systemic corticosteroid therapy.
In rats trained to retain a passive avoidance response or to retrieve a learned task in the radial and water maze tests, a pretreatment with 2-hexyl-3-indoleacetamide (FGIN-1-27) (IC50 57 mumol/kg p.o.) or 4' chlorodiazepam (4'CD) (15 mumol/kg i.p.), two steroidogenic ligands at the mitochondria diazepam-binding inhibitor receptor complex (MDRC), antagonized the performance deficit elicited by dizocilpine (0.3 mumol/kg i.p.), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. The 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(-1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK-11195), an antagonist at MDRC in vivo, failed to modify the disruptive effect of dizocilpine in the passive avoidance response but reversed the FGIN-1-27- or 4' CD-induced antagonism of dizocilpine behavioral actions. Pretreatment with pregnenolone sulfate (48 mumol/kg i.p.), 3 alpha, 21-dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (THDOC) (15 mumol/kg i.v.) and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) (15 mumol/kg i.v.) also reduced the passive avoidance retention deficit elicited by dizocilpine. The (17-beta)-17-[[bis(1-methylethyl)amino[carbonyl]androstane-3,5-diene-3- carboxylic acid (SKF-105111), a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, blocked the antagonism of dizocilpine behavioral actions by pregnenolone sulfate or by FGIN-1-27 but not those caused by THDOC or allopregnanolone either in normal or adrenalectomized-castrated rats. Thus, it is inferred that the amnesic effect of dizocilpine is counteracted by FGIN-1-27, 4'CD and pregnenolone sulfate because of their ability to increase brain accumulation of allopregnanolone.
Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a well-established carcinogen and human exposure has been associated with a variety of cancers including those of skin, lung, and bladder. High expression of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) has associated with local relapses in early stages of urinary bladder cancer. iAs exposures are at least in part determined by the rate of formation and composition of iAs metabolites (MAs(III), MAs(V), DMAs(III), DMAs(V)). This study examines the relationship between TGF-alpha concentration in exfoliated bladder urothelial cells (BUC) separated from urine and urinary arsenic species in 72 resident women (18-51 years old) from areas exposed to different concentrations of iAs in drinking water (2-378 ppb) in central Mexico. Urinary arsenic species, including trivalent methylated metabolites were measured by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry method. The concentration of TGF-alpha in BUC was measured using an ELISA assay. Results show a statistically significant positive correlation between TGF-alpha concentration in BUC and each of the six arsenic species present in urine. The multivariate linear regression analyses show that the increment of TGF-alpha levels in BUC was importantly associated with the presence of arsenic species after adjusting by age, and presence of urinary infection. People from areas with high arsenic exposure had a significantly higher TGF-alpha concentration in BUC than people from areas of low arsenic exposure (128.8 vs. 64.4 pg/mg protein; p<0.05). Notably, exfoliated cells isolated from individuals with skin lesions contained significantly greater amount of TGF-alpha than cells from individuals without skin lesions: 157.7 vs. 64.9 pg/mg protein (p=0.003). These results suggest that TGF-alpha in exfoliated BUC may serve as a susceptibility marker of adverse health effects on epithelial tissue in arsenic-endemic areas.
The aim of this experiment was to establish the usefulness of assessing temporal variability of the QT interval and changes in the T wave morphology in dogs as markers of pro-arrhythmic risk in humans. For this purpose, the electrocardiographic effects of astemizole and cisapride, two well known pro-arrhythmic drugs in humans, were assessed in dogs.
Astemizole was administered intravenously at single doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg whilst cisapride was administered orally at doses of 1.5 and 6 mg/kg. Electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded before and after treatment. From each ECG tracing, QT intervals were recorded over 100 beats for calculation of the mean and standard deviation (SD) of QT and mean corrected QT (QTc). The coefficient of variation of QT (CV=SD/mean) was calculated as an indicator of QT temporal variability. The changes in T wave morphology were assessed in precordial lead CV5RL.
Astemizole increased both the QTc interval and the CV of QT. Increases in these parameters also occurred after cisapride, but were less marked than after astemizole. In addition, both compounds produced a notching of the T wave, consisting of the presence of two peaks.
The effects of astemizole and cisapride on the CV of QT and their propensity to induce of T wave notching are consistent with the blocking of I(Kr) channels and indicate, respectively, an increase in temporal variability of cardiac repolarization and an increased heterogeneity of the repolarization of cardiac cells across the myocardium. These changes are key triggers of arrhythmic events and are thus consistent with the pro-arrhythmic properties of these drugs. This study therefore indicates that the evaluation of CV of QT and T wave morphology in dogs may help in predicting drug-induced pro-arrhythmic risk in humans.
Our recent studies have demonstrated that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is involved in the induction and maintenance of cocaine behavioral sensitization and chronic cocaine-induced neural plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. In the present study, we used ILK silencing to investigate how ILK may influence cocaine-induced neural plasticity. Adeno-associated virus carrying a small interfering RNA-ILK cassette under the control of an inducible Tet-On system was injected into the NAc core of Sprague-Dawley rats. Induced silencing was established during repeated cocaine injections (sensitization induction period) or between withdrawal days 9 and 22 (sensitization maintenance period). Under both paradigms, established cocaine sensitization under non-silenced conditions was associated with enhanced PSD-95 and synapsin I protein expression as well as enhanced Ser(845) phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit on withdrawal day. Silencing ILK expression under both paradigms prevented or reversed these changes. Importantly, ILK appears to form a complex with PSD-95 and synapsin I because it co-immunoprecipitated with each of these proteins. Together, these data suggest that ILK exerts pleiotropic actions by regulating pre- and postsynaptic neural plasticities within the NAc core in response to repeated cocaine exposure.
We examined risk factors for intracranial bleeding while on oral anticoagulants (OACs) in 68 patients admitted to hospital over a 6-year period, and 204 out-patient controls followed-up in an OAC clinic. Under multivariate analysis, significant risk factors for OAC-related intracranial bleeds were hypertension (OR (95%CI) 2.69 (1.04-6.97), duration of OAC therapy < or =12 months (OR 3.74 (1.21-11.56)), duration > or =96 months (OR 0.25 (0.07-0.88)), and International Normalized Ratio on admission >4.5 (OR 10.92 (2.46-48.43)). A logistic regression model including the above variables along with a history of 'cerebrovascular disease' (OR 2.32 (0.98-5.46)) correctly predicted intracranial bleeding (or its absence) during OAC therapy in 85% of all patients. The risk associated with advanced age and concomitant aspirin use was not significantly increased in this analysis. It is important to achieve tight control of INR, particularly in the early months of treatment. Patients with previous cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of intracranial bleeding on warfarin, and hypertensive patients should have especially close monitoring and optimal control of their blood pressure.
