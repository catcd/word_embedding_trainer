We have previously demonstrated that intranasal administration of ambient ultrafine particles (UFP) acts as an adjuvant for primary allergic sensitization to ovalbumin (OVA) in Balb/c mice. It is important to find out whether inhaled UFP exert the same effect on the secondary immune response as a way of explaining asthma flares in already-sensitized individuals due to traffic exposure near a freeway. The objective of this study is to determine whether inhalation exposure to ambient UFP near an urban freeway could enhance the secondary immune response to OVA in already-sensitized mice. Prior OVA-sensitized animals were exposed to concentrated ambient UFP at the time of secondary OVA challenge in our mobile animal laboratory in Los Angeles. OVA-specific antibody production, airway morphometry, allergic airway inflammation, cytokine gene expression, and oxidative stress marker were assessed. As few as five ambient UFP exposures were sufficient to promote the OVA recall immune response, including generating allergic airway inflammation in smaller and more distal airways compared with the adjuvant effect of intranasally instilled UFP on the primary immune response. The secondary immune response was characterized by the T helper 2 and IL-17 cytokine gene expression in the lung. In summary, our results demonstrated that inhalation of prooxidative ambient UFP could effectively boost the secondary immune response to an experimental allergen, indicating that vehicular traffic exposure could exacerbate allergic inflammation in already-sensitized subjects.
It has been reported that the newborn immune system differs quantitatively and functionally from that of adults. Development of the immune system has important implications for childhood diseases. The immaturity of the immune system in the prenatal or suckling stage may contribute to susceptibility to environmental toxic chemical exposure. In the present study, to clarify the effect of low-level toluene exposure on immune functions during developmental stage, pregnant mice were exposed to 0, 5, and 50 ppm toluene from gestational day 14 to day 19 with or without stimulation by peptidoglycan (PGN) of a gram-positive bacterial cell wall component, a toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligand. We examined Th1/Th2 balance in the offspring's at 3 weeks old using ELISA and real-time RT-PCR methods. Exposure of mice to 50 ppm toluene enhanced total immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a (Th1-dependent) level in plasma. On the other hand, splenic expression of transcription factor T-bet (Th1-specific), GATA-3 (Th2-specific) and Foxp3 (gene marker for regulatory CD4+CD25+ T-cells) mRNAs was suppressed in these mice, but not in the combination of 5 or 50 ppm toluene with PGN. In addition, total IgG1 (Th2 dependent) level was suppressed in the combination of 5 or 50 ppm toluene with PGN. Our findings indicate that modulation of Th1- and Th2-responses may occur in low-level toluene exposure and/or combination with PGN stimulation in infant mice.
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HATT) is an unusual but serious complication of heparin therapy. Twenty-five patients (13 men and 12 women) had thrombocytopenia and arterial or venous thrombosis 1 to 10 days (mean, 6.3 days) after the start of heparin administration. The vessels in the affected extremity had been entered for catheterization, arteriography, or passage of a balloon counterpulsation device in 19 of the 25 patients. In vitro platelet aggregation with heparin was seen in all patients. Additional studies were performed to see whether other lots or sources of heparin also produced in vitro aggregation. Four separate lots of beef lung heparin, commercial heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa, and two types of low molecular weight heparin were all highly stimulatory in this system. However, Org 10172, a heparinoid, did not induce aggregation in any of 13 patient plasmas tested. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin was also examined. Aspirin abolished in vitro aggregation in 9 of 16 cases and decreased the degree of aggregation from 85% to 55% (p = 0.02) in the remaining seven cases. We conclude that in patients with HATT platelet aggregation is equally induced by beef lung, porcine intestinal, and some forms of low molecular weight heparin. Org 10172 does not stimulate platelet aggregation in plasma from these patients in vitro. Finally, there may be a role for aspirin in treating patients with HATT.
We report a case of myocardial ischemia induced by cocaine. The ischemia probably induced by coronary artery spasm was reversed by nitroglycerin and calcium blocking agents.
To determine if pulmonary perfusion was improved in acute pulmonary embolism after therapy with recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), lung scans were obtained before and a mean of 22 hours after therapy in 19 patients. The posttherapy lung scans were compared with baseline, pretherapy scans with use of two semiquantitative methods--an anteroposterior view method, similar to that used in the Urokinase Pulmonary Embolism Trial, and a segmental method that emphasized pulmonary anatomy. There was an improvement in the defect score from 0.35 to 0.14 (P less than .01) when the anteroposterior view method was used and from 0.37 to 0.16 (P less than .01) when the segmental method was used. These encouraging results in the early posttherapy period suggest that rt-PA is especially effective in improving regional perfusion after pulmonary embolism and that a larger controlled trial of therapy with rt-PA for acute pulmonary embolism should be performed. Scoring lung scans with a segmental method is feasible and appropriate for present-day lung scan technique and should be considered in future studies.
We experienced a case in which a 66 year-old male patient developed anaphylactic shock followed by ventricular fibrillation, possibly due to intravenous aspiration of chlorhexidine used for topical application when right internal jugular vein was punctured. He was successfully resuscitated without any sequelae. Although lymphocyte transformation test failed to identify the specific allergen, IgE antibodies against chlorhexidine in the patient's serum were detected by radioallergosorbent technique. Chlorhexidine is an extensively used antiseptic, but there have been many reports regarding severe adverse reactions associated with its use. Chlorhexidine does not seem to be a safe antiseptic.
We report a case of prosthetic valve endocarditis and persistent bacteremia due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The combination of parenteral chloramphenicol plus minocycline therapy was administered for 8 weeks and resulted in cure after treatment with quinupristin-dalfopristin had failed.
The pituitary gland is composed of hormone-producing cells essential for homeostasis and reproduction. Pituitary cells are sensitive to endocrine feedback in the adult and can have altered hormonal secretion from exposure to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is a prevalent plasticizer used in food and beverage containers, leading to widespread human exposure. Although prenatal exposure to BPA can impact reproductive function in the adult, the effects of BPA on the developing pituitary are unknown. We hypothesized that prenatal exposure to low doses of BPA impacts gonadotroph cell number or parameters of hormone synthesis. To test this, pregnant mice were administered 0.5 μg/kg/day of BPA, 50 μg/kg/day of BPA, or vehicle beginning on Embryonic Day 10.5. At parturition, pituitaries from female offspring exposed in utero to either dose of BPA had increased proliferation, as assessed by mKi67 mRNA levels and immunohistochemistry. Coincidently, gonadotroph number also increased in treated females. However, we observed a dichotomy between mRNA levels of Lhb and Fshb. Female mice exposed to 0.5 μg/kg/day BPA had increased mRNA levels of gonadotropins and the gonadotropin-receptor hormone (GNRH) receptor (Gnrhr), which mediates GNRH regulation of gonadotropin production and release. In contrast, mice treated with 50 μg/kg/day of BPA had decreased gonadotropin mRNA levels, Gnrhr and Nr5a1, a transcription factor required for gonadotroph differentiation. No other pituitary hormones were altered on the day of birth in response to in utero BPA exposure, and male pituitaries showed no change in the parameters tested. Collectively, these results show that prenatal exposure to BPA affects pituitary gonadotroph development in females.
Preclinical studies have emphasized that persistent small afferent input will induce a state of central facilitation that can be regulated by systemically administered lidocaine. The authors extended these preclinical studies to human volunteers by examining the concentration-dependent effects of intravenous lidocaine on acute sensory thresholds and facilitated processing induced by intradermal capsaicin.
Fifteen healthy persons received a lidocaine or a placebo infusion. A computer-controlled infusion pump targeted sequential stepwise increases in plasma lidocaine concentration steps of 1, 2, and 3 microg/ml. At each plasma concentration, neurosensory testing (thermal and von Frey hair test stimulation) were performed. After completing the tests at the 3 microg/ml plasma lidocaine level, intradermal capsaicin was injected into the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the flare response and hyperalgesia to von Frey hair stimulation, stroking, and heat was assessed.
The continuous infusion of lidocaine and placebo had no significant effect on any stimulus threshold. Although intravenous lidocaine resulted in a decrease in all secondary hyperalgesia responses, this was only significant for heat hyperalgesia. Intravenous lidocaine resulted in a significant decrease in the flare response induced by intradermal capsaicin.
These studies suggest that the facilitated state induced by persistent small afferent input human pain models may predict the activity of agents that affect components of nociceptive processing that are different from those associated with the pain state evoked by "acute" thermal or mechanical stimuli. Such insight may be valuable in the efficient development of novel analgesics for both neuropathic and post-tissue-injury pain states.
This paper reports a new type of syndromic craniosynostosis that was diagnosed by DNA analysis of the patient's fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes. At birth, a male infant had ocular proptosis, a pseudotail, and obstructed respiration. He developed craniosynostosis, craniofacial dysmorphism, hydrocephalus, and bilateral contracture of his elbow joints. His treatment included fronto-orbital advancements and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Genetic analysis revealed that he was heterozygous for a missense mutation in exon 9 of the FGFR2 gene that resulted in an amino acid substitution of cysteine for serine at residue 351 (Ser351Cys). Seven cases with this mutation had previously been reported. All had severe craniosynostosis with midface hypoplasia, elbow joint contracture, developmental retardation, and early death.
The mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease induced by arsenic exposure are not completely understood. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether arsenic-fed mice have an increased vascular leakage response to vasoactive agents and whether enhanced type-2 protein phosphatase (PP2A) activity is involved in mustard oil-induced leakage. ICR mice were fed water or sodium arsenite (20 mg/kg) for 4 or 8 weeks. The leakage response to vasoactive agents was quantified using the Evans blue (EB) technique or vascular labeling with carbon particles. Increased EB leakage and high density of carbon-labeled microvessels were detected in arsenic-fed mice treated with mustard oil. Histamine induced significantly higher vascular leakage in arsenic-fed mice than in water-fed mice. Pretreatment with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) blocker RP67580 significantly reduced mustard oil-induced vascular leakage in arsenic-fed mice. The protein levels of PP2Ac and NK1R were similar in both groups. PP2A activity was significantly higher in the arsenic-fed mice compared with the control group. These findings indicate that microvessels generally respond to vasoactive agents, and that the increased PP2A activity is involved in mustard oil-induced vascular leakage in arsenic-fed mice. Arsenic may initiate endothelial dysfunction, resulting in vascular leakage in response to vasoactive agents.
The toxicities of doxorubicin (DXR) and 3'-deamino-3'-morpholino-13-deoxy-10-hydroxycarcminomycin (KRN8602) were compared in perfused rat heart preparations. In addition, their toxicities in isolated myocytes as well as their abilities to cause oxidation of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) were evaluated. Finally, their capacities to initiate oxygen consumption and lipid peroxidation in isolated microsomes were determined. DXR caused a dramatic decrease in left ventricular pressure in the perfused hearts and a leak of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) from isolated myocytes. These effects were not observed with KRN8602 at comparable concentrations although KRN8602 caused oxidation of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in the myocytes. Both anthracyclines caused an increase in oxygen consumption and lipid peroxidation in isolated microsomes although these effects were more pronounced with KRN8602. The results of these experiments demonstrate that, despite the high capacity to redox cycle and to generate oxygen-derived oxidants, KRN8602 exhibited no measurable cardiotoxicity. The findings are consistent with a view that, if the formation of such oxidants is central to the cardiotoxicity of DXR, these substances must be formed in cellular compartments, e.g. plasma membranes, where the morpholino derivative (KRN8602) does not accumulate.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the rate-limiting enzyme of prostaglandin synthesis, has been implicated in invasiveness and distant metastases of cancer. Bone is one of the most common target sites of cancer metastasis. However, the role of COX-2 in bone metastasis is unclear. We examined the surgical specimens of bone metastases from patients with various types of cancers by using immunohistochemistry and observed evident COX-2 expression in these bone metastases. In a nude mouse model of bone metastasis, the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells showed no COX-2 expression at orthotopic sites, whereas these cells, when metastasized to bone, intensely expressed COX-2, suggesting that the bone microenvironment induced COX-2 expression. Consistent with this notion, inhibition of bone resorption by the bisphosphonate ibandronate reduced COX-2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells in bone. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), one of the most abundant growth factors stored in bone, increased COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 production in MDA-MB-231 cells in culture. MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing dominant-negative TGFbeta type II receptors showed decreased bone metastases and reduced osteoclastic bone resorption with impaired COX-2 expression. The COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398 and nimesulide, significantly suppressed bone metastases with decreased osteoclast number and increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggest that bone-derived TGFbeta up-regulates COX-2 expression in breast cancer cells, thereby increasing prostaglandin E2 production, which in turn, stimulates osteoclastic bone destruction, leading to the progression of bone metastases. Our results also suggest that COX-2 is a potential therapeutic target for bone metastases in breast cancer.
One of the most common chemicals that behaves as an endocrine disruptor is the compound 4,4'-isopronylidenediphenol, called bisphenol-A. In the previous study, we reported that exposure to bisphenol-A induced the abnormality of dopamine receptor functions in the mouse limbic area, resulting in a supersensitivity of drugs of abuse-induced pharmacological actions. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether prenatal and neonatal exposures to bisphenol-A could alter other behavioral abnormalities such as anxiogenic behavior, motor learning behavior, or memory. In the present study, adult female mice were chronically treated with bisphenol-A-admixed powder food from mating to weaning. All experiments were performed using male pups. Here we found that prenatal and neonatal exposures to bisphenol-A failed to induce anxiogenic effects and motor-learning impairment using the light-dark test, elevated plus maze test, and rota-rod test. On the other hand, we found that prenatal and neonatal exposures to bisphenol-A induced the memory impairment using the step-through passive avoidance test. Immunohistochemical study showed the dramatic reduction in choline acetyltransferase-like immunoreactivity, which is a marker of acetylcholine (ACh) production, in the hippocampus of mice prenatally and neonatally exposed to bisphenol-A. These results suggest that chronic exposures to bisphenol-A could induce the memory impairment associated with the reduction in ACh production in the hippocampus.
We have previously shown that administration of lithium to rats in the first weeks after birth results in a severe interstitial nephropathy. The aim of the present work was to study the relationship between functional impairment and structural lesions and to evaluate whether the nephropathy regresses after withdrawal of lithium. Three groups of animals were studied: 16 weeks-old controls (group A), rats treated with lithium for 16 weeks (group B) and rats treated for 8 weeks followed by 8 weeks without lithium (group C). Plasma urea and renal concentrating ability were determined and one kidney fixed by vascular perfusion with glutaraldehyde for light microscope morphometry. The results show a significant reduction in renal function after lithium treatment. There was a highly significant reduction in proximal tubular length and a pronounced increase in interstitial volume due to severe fibrosis. The total mass of glomerular tufts was also reduced, but not when this parameter was divided by the body weight. Sclerotic glomeruli were not observed. The structural and functional lithium-induced lesions are independent of sex and irreversible, since they persist 8 weeks after withdrawal of lithium. It is proposed that lithium-induced interstitial fibrosis is followed by proximal tubular atrophy with a reduction in the amount of functioning proximal tubules. This leads to a decrease in proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and a disturbance in the glomerulo-tubular balance resulting in a decrease in glomerular filtration rate.
Triclosan is an antimicrobial found in personal care and sanitizing products, such as soaps, toothpaste, and hair products. There have been recent concerns for the possible effects on human health, as triclosan has been detected in human breast milk, blood, and urine samples. In a previous study, we found that triclosan alters serum thyroid hormone and testosterone concentrations in male rats. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of triclosan in the female Wistar rat following exposure for 21 days in the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program pubertal protocol and the weanling uterotrophic assay (3-day exposure). In the pubertal study, triclosan advanced the age of onset of vaginal opening and increased uterine weight at 150 mg/kg, indicative of an estrogenic effect. In the uterotrophic assay, rats received oral doses of triclosan (1.18, 2.35, 4.69, 9.37, 18.75, 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg) alone, 3 microg/kg ethinyl estradiol (EE), or triclosan (same doses as above) plus 3 microg/kg EE. Uterine weight was increased in the EE group (positive control) as compared with the control but was not affected by triclosan alone. However, there was a significant dose-dependent increase in the group cotreated with EE and triclosan (>or= 4.69 mg/kg) as compared with EE alone, indicating a potentiation of the estrogen response on uterine weight. This result was well correlated with potentiated estrogen-induced changes in uterine histology. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations were also suppressed by triclosan in this study, similar to other studies in the male and female rat. In conclusion, triclosan affected estrogen-mediated responses in the pubertal and weanling female rat and also suppressed thyroid hormone in both studies. The lowest effective concentrations in the rodent model are approximately 10 (for estrogen) and 40 (for thyroid hormone) times higher than the highest concentrations reported in human plasma.
The role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of liver disease in Wilson disease (WD), a genetic disorder characterized by excess hepatic deposition of copper, which generates free radicals, remains unclear. This study investigates oxidative stress on the liver and hepatic anti-oxidant responses in WD using liver specimens from affected patients showing mild liver damage (group I, n = 3), moderate or greater liver damage (group II, n = 5) and fulminant hepatic failure (group III, n = 5), and from asymptomatic carriers (n = 2). Decreased ratios of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), a lipid peroxidation product, were found in every affected patient, especially in groups II and III patients. Activities and protein expressions of Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), CuZn-SOD, and catalase were decreased in all patients, especially in group III patients. Glutathione peroxidase activity was decreased only in group III patients. Asymptomatic carriers without any clinical manifestations showed normal TBARS level and GSH/GSSG ratio with increases in both GSH and GSSG levels. Their CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD and catalase activities were increased. These results suggest that excessive copper-derived oxidants contribute to development and progression of liver disease in WD.
A retrospective questionnaire revealed 11 patients with halothane related liver disturbances in Finland in 1972-1981. Seven of the cases were regarded as obvious and two as probable halothane hepatitis (HH). Four patients suffered HH twice, and none of the cases had a fatal outcome. The speed of onset of icterus correlated with the number of halothane exposures, as did the increase in liver enzyme (ASAT, ALAT) activities and the increase in serum bilirubin concentration. Halothane anaesthesia is strictly contraindicated if a nondefinite icterus has appeared after a previous exposure to halothane. It should not be given if unclear fever or prolonged nausea have followed a previous exposure. No major adverse effects or organ toxicity connected with enflurane were found.
A 61-year-old man developed atrial fibrillation 2 weeks after the administration of simvastatin (5 mg once daily) and recovered to sinus rhythm 3 days after withdrawal of the drug. Electrocardiography had not previously revealed an abnormality except for transient atrial fibrillation and left atrial overloading. Although he has not been given any antiarrhythmic agents, sinus rhythm is being continuously maintained. The timing of the transient atrial fibrillation attack was closely related to the administration of simvastatin. An inhibitory effect of myocardial energy metabolism through ubiquinone synthesis may play a role in the development of atrial fibrillation.
Cisplatin and carboplatin cause dose-dependent renal dysfunction. Electrolyte abnormalities such as hypomagnesaemia and hypokalemia are commonly reported adverse effects, in addition to increased serum creatinine and uremia. Cumulative dose, dehydration, hypoalbuminemia, and concurrent use of nephrotoxic drugs have been suggested as risk factors for cisplatin nephrotoxicity. The adverse effects of ifosfamide include proximal tubular damage, and renal wasting of electrolytes, glucose and amino acids, Fanconi syndrome, rickets and osteomalacia have also been reported with ifosfamide treatment. Risk factors for ifosfamide nephrotoxicity include the cumulative dose, young age, previous or concurrent cisplatin treatment, and unilateral nephrectomy. Ifosfamide/Carboplatin/Etoposide (ICE) combination therapy induces hypouricemia, which frequently includes renal wasting of electrolytes, and persistent hypouricemia has been observed in recurrent or chemotherapy-resistant patients. We retrospectively examined the incidence of hypouricemia and clinical findings in pediatric patients treated with an ICE regimen. Twenty of 28 (71.4%) pediatric patients had hypouricemia. The duration of hypouricemia was longer in the non-remission subgroup of patients, which suggests that hypouricemia may be a predictive marker for prognosis of malignant disease and efficacy of drugs such as ifosfamide, carboplatin and cisplatin. Nephrotoxicity induced by these drugs may also be more common in pediatric patients than in adults, but it is unclear why a young age is a risk factor and further research is required regarding the mechanism of antineoplastic drug induced-nephrotoxicity in children.
Therefore, this study was designed to analyze the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid concentrations of IL-5, RANTES (CCL5) and eotaxin (CCL11) and also to examine the relationship between the percentage and absolute number of the BAL eosinophils and these measured chemokines in patients with sulfur mustard (SM) gas-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF).
Fifteen veterans with mustard gas-induced PF and 14 normal veterans as control group.
Pulmonary function tests, tests for D(LCO), computed tomography scans of the chest, analyses of BAL fluids for RANTES (CCL5), eotaxin (CCL11), and IL-5 were performed in all cases.
Eosinophilic alveolitis was the predominant feature (p < 0.0001). There were significant differences in CCL5, CCL11, and IL-5 levels of BAL fluid between patients with PF and controls (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and p = 0.001, respectively). The concentrations of CCL5 and CCL11 showed positive correlations with percentage (r = 0.57 and p = 0.03; r = 0.52 and p = 0.04, respectively) and absolute counts (r = 0.54 and p = 0.04, r = 0.53 and p = 0.04, respectively) of BAL eosinophils. There were significant positive correlations between the concentrations of IL-5 and the proportion and total cell number of eosinophils in BAL (r = 0.67 and p = 0.01; r = 0.59 and p = 0.02, respectively) too.
A significant correlation between BAL CCL5, CCL11, and IL-5 levels and eosinophils in patients with pulmonary fibrosis due to SM gas inhalation has been demonstrated, suggesting that these C-C chemokines and IL-5 contribute to the recruitment of eosinophils cells in the lung in these victims.
To evaluate the effects of valsartan (Val) with or without benazepril (Ben) on blood pressure and plasma levels of angiotensin (Ang II) and digoxin-immunoreactive factors (endoxin) in patients with essential hypertension.
Ninety patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=30 per group): Ben group (Ben 10 mg/d, po); Val group (Val 80 mg/d, po); combination drug therapy group (Val 80 mg/d+Ben 10 mg/d, po); all patients were treated for 12 weeks. Age and sex-matched 20 normal subjects were served as control group.
The levels of plasma endoxin and Ang II in patients with essential hypertension were remarkably higher than those in normal subjects. The levels of plasma Ang II and endoxin were all obvious positive correlation with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (Ang II: r=0.5151, 0.7978; endoxin: r=0.4706, 0.7274, respectively). Within 6 weeks of drug intervene, SBP and DBP were remarkably decreased in 3 groups. After 6 weeks, SBP and DBP were continuously decreased in Ben group and Val+Ben group, but not in Val group. Level of plasma Ang II was remarkably decreased as SBP and DBP decreased in Ben group and Val+Ben group; level of plasma Ang II was remarkably increased in Val group.
Val with or without Ben remarkably decreased SBP and DBP in patients with essential hypertension within 6 weeks. Antihypertensive efficacy was weakened after long-term use of Val alone. The antihypertensive effect of Val+Ben group was the most remarkable among 3 groups and could avoid the side effects of high plasma Ang II.
Sixty patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were administered weekly low dose methotrexate (MTX) were retrospectively analyzed for their untoward effects of MTX by interviewing to the patients and by the medical records. Cough and sputa were the most frequent symptoms (23.3%) and gastrointestinal symptoms were the next (20%). Five of 60 patients (8.2%) showed liver function test abnormalities, and four (6.7%) exhibited transient exacerbation of arthralgia for several hours to a few days after MTX administration. Three patients (5%) suffered from interstitial pneumonitis. Hair loss was seen in 3 patients (5%), and headache, leucocytepenia, fever, skin eruption, abnormal taste, hemorrhagic cystitis, and flashing were experienced in a patient, respectively. Three (5%) suffered from fungal infection, and herpes zoster, sepsis, and osteomyelitis were experienced in each one patient, respectively. MTX was withdrawn in three patients (5%) because of cough and sputa the drug was withdrawn in other three patients because of the interstitial pneumonia, and was drawn in another three patients because of transient exacerbation of arthralgia. The drug was withdrawn in each one patient, because of nausea and vomiting, skin eruption, osteomyelitis, and sepsis, respectively. Overall, MTX were withdrawn in 21 patients (35%), and, of those, 13 patients (21.7%) because of untoward effects and 8 patients (13.3%) because of the lack of efficacy.
The proliferation-specific Forkhead Box m1 (Foxm1 or Foxm1b) transcription factor (previously called HFH-11B, Trident, Win, or MPP2) regulates expression of cell cycle genes essential for progression into DNA replication and mitosis. Expression of Foxm1 is found in a variety of distinct human cancers including hepatocellular carcinomas, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, ductal breast carcinomas, and anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. In this study, we show that human Foxm1 protein is abundantly expressed in highly proliferative human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) as well as in mouse lung tumors induced by urethane. To determine the role of Foxm1 during the development of mouse lung tumors, we used IFN-inducible Mx-Cre recombinase transgene to delete mouse Foxm1 fl/fl-targeted allele before inducing lung tumors with urethane. We show that Mx-Cre Foxm1-/- mice exhibit diminished proliferation of lung tumor cells causing a significant reduction in number and size of lung adenomas. Transient transfection experiments with A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells show that depletion of Foxm1 levels by short interfering RNA caused diminished DNA replication and mitosis and reduced anchorage-independent growth of cell colonies on soft agar. Foxm1-depleted A549 cells exhibit reduced expression of cell cycle-promoting cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 genes. These data show that Foxm1 stimulates the proliferation of tumor cells during progression of NSCLC.
