In order to investigate markers of toxic injury and elucidate the mechanisms underlying methanol intoxication at the protein level, proteomics technology was applied to study variations in retinal protein expression between normal rats and rat models of methanol intoxication.
Seven rats were administered saline and methanol respectively by gavage. After seven days, retinal function was assessed by electroretinography and retinal proteins were extracted and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The gels were then stained with AgNOâ‚ƒ and analyzed with Pdquest software. The differential expression of proteins was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS, and related proteins were searched in a protein database.
Twenty-eight spots with significant differences were found, 24 of which were successfully identified. Specifically, there were 14 increased expression proteins, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase, tropomyosin alpha-1 chain, myosin light chain, and crystallin family proteins. There were 10 decreased expression ones, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, recoverin, ATP synthase alpha subunit in rats with methanol toxicity.
Retinal function was greatly destroyed upon methanol intoxication. Several key proteins were up- or down-regulated upon induced retinal toxicity, indicating that there are other mechanisms underlying methanol poisoning besides oxidative injury. Together, this data provides insight and knowledge for future studies in this field.
The effects of two dinitroanilines, oryzalin and trifluralin, were compared against Cryptosporidium parvum, in vitro using HCT-8 cells and in vivo using neonatal Swiss ARC mice and Wistar neonatal rats. In vitro, oryzalin and trifluralin exhibited IC(50) values (concentration necessary to cause a 50% inhibition) of 750 and 800 nM, respectively. A viability assay showed that neither compound produced a cytotoxic effect on the host cells at concentrations as high as 1 microM. The in vivo component of this study consisted of inoculation of neonatal mice and neonatal rats with 10(5) viable oocysts of C. parvum per animal and the subsequent treatment of this infection with trifluralin and oryzalin administered via gastric intubation. At doses of 100 mg kg(-1) body weight administered twice daily for 3 consecutive days, trifluralin had no statistically significant effect on the number of oocysts recovered from the gut of either rats or mice compared with controls, whereas at the same concentration, oryzalin caused 90 and 79% inhibition of oocysts recovered from mice and rats, respectively.
Numerous chemicals released into the environment by man are able to disrupt the functioning of the endocrine system by binding to estrogen receptors in estrogen-responsive cells. The ability of o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) and methoxychlor to compete with estradiol for binding to estrogen receptors in MCF-7 cells (relative binding affinity; RBA) was examined in both serum-free medium and 100% serum; this is referred to as a relative binding affinity-serum modified access (RBA-SMA) assay. RBA's ranged from 0.04% for o,p'-DDT (which showed enhanced access to cells in serum relative to serum-free medium) to 0.004% for methoxychlor (which did not show enhanced access in serum). Based on these findings, these pesticides, along with diethylstilbestrol (DES) as a positive control, were fed to pregnant mice from days 11-17 of pregnancy. When the male offspring were examined in adulthood for their rate of urine marking in a novel territory (territorial behaviour), the rate of urine marking increased dramatically with low doses of DES (relative to controls) and then decreased significantly at the highest dose administered prenatally. Relative binding in MCF-7 cells accurately predicted the doses of o,p'-DDT and methoxychlor that produced the same results, providing support for the hypothesis that effects on behaviour were mediated by binding to estrogen receptors in the developing brain.
Fever, tachycardia, and hypertension developed concurrently with the administration of thiothixene during an acute episode of agitation in a case of catatonic schizophrenia. No cause for the fever or hyperkinetic state was found, and the syndrome resolved spontaneously one week after antipsychotic drug therapy was halted. This case appears to be an example of "acute lethal catatonia" or the neuroleptic "malignant" syndrome, both of which may be due to disturbances of dopamine function within the CNS. Such cases are rare, but may be dramatic in their presentation; however, antipsychotic drugs must be withheld during the duration of the disorder.
Newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) still have high mortality. Recently, a possible role of cardiac maldevelopment has been suggested. Human and experimental studies have demonstrated that heart weight is significantly reduced in the presence of CDH. Recent studies have suggested an important role for insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in the regulation of cardiac growth, structure, and function. Administration of IGF-I to normal rats has been shown to cause cardiac hypertrophy. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in cardiac differentiation and development. The aim of this study was to determine the gene-level expression of IGF-I and EGF in the hearts of rats with nitrofen-induced CDH using the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCR). CDH was induced in pregnant rats following administration of 100 mg nitrofen on day 9.5 of gestation (term 22 days). In control animals, the same dose of olive oil was given without nitrofen. Cesarean section was performed on day 21 of gestation. The fetuses were divided into three groups: normal controls (n = 8), nitrofen without CDH (n = 8), and nitrofen-induced CDH (n = 8). Total RNA was extracted from the hearts in each group and measured. mRNA was extracted from total RNA. RT-PCR was performed to evaluate mRNA expressions of IGF-I and EGF. Levels of mRNA were expressed as a ratio of band density divided by that of beta-actin, a housekeeping gene known to be expressed at a constant level. IGF-I mRNA expression was significantly decreased in CDH hearts (0.177 +/- 0.109) compared to controls (0.393 +/- 0.138) (P < 0.01) and nitrofen hearts without CDH (0.321 +/- 0.088) (P < 0.05). EGF mRNA expression was significantly decreased in CDH hearts (0.218 +/- 0.118) compared to controls (0.534 +/- 0.196) (P < 0.01) and nitrofen hearts without CDH (0.383 +/- 0.136) (P < 0.05). Decreased cardiac gene expression of IGF-I and EGF in the hypoplastic heart suggests that cardiac hypoplasia in nitrofen-induced rat CDH may be due to reduced synthesis of IGF-I and EGF by myocytes in the developing heart.
Quinine, a cinchona alkaloid, was investigated for putative anxiogenic activity in view of clinical reports suggesting that it induces anxiety and apprehension following its use in malaria. The experimental paradigms chosen to elucidate anxiogenic activity have been shown to stand the tests of reliability and validity. Yohimbine, which has been shown to induce anxiety both in animals and in man, was used for comparison. Quinine was found to elicit a complex behavioural profile of activity ranging from overt central stimulation to marked central depression on dose increment. The doses 10 and 20 mg/kg, ip, of quinine chosen to investigate anxiogenic activity were comparable to those induced by 2.5 and 5 mg/kg ip of yohimbine. Quinine induced a dose-related anxiogenic activity in the open-field and elevated plus-maze tests in mice, and the social interaction and thirst conflict tests in rats, similar to effects induced by yohimbine. In addition, both quinine and yohimbine attenuated the effects of diazepam, an anxiolytic agent, in the open-field and thirst conflict tests. The results indicate that quinine exerts significant anxiogenic effect at a particular dose range.
Acute renal failure developed in a 47-year-old man during the second course of a high-dose methotrexate sodium (MTX) treatment for chondrosarcoma of the pelvis with pulmonary metastasis. Uninterrupted peritoneal dialysis for seven days had a negligible effect on plasma MTX. Although high-dose leucovorin calcium prevented severe myelosuppression and mucositis, the patient died 12 days after receiving MTX. Renal histological studies showed severe tubulointerstitial damage consistent with MTX toxicity. Better alternatives for removing MTX in patients with renal failure are clearly needed.
To investigate the effects of taxol on the inner ear in a mice model.
This study was performed on 112 ears of 56 albino Swiss mice. All animals underwent baseline auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing bilaterally and baseline Peak Equivalent Sound Pressure Levels (PESPLs) were obtained. The mice were randomly assigned to seven groups consisting of one control and six study groups. The control group received no medications while the mice in groups 1-6 received 1 x 60, 1 x 20, 2 x 20, 3 x 20, 4 x 20 and 5 x 20 mg/kg taxol intraperitoneally. Control ABR assessments were performed 3 weeks after the last dose. The animals were then sacrificed while still anaesthetised and the bullae (cochleae included) were dissected from their temporal bones. Haematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome stains were used to demonstrate connective tissue, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was used to highlight epithelial elements.
Significant decreases in the hearing levels were observed in all the groups which received taxol. No correlation was observed between the dose given and the degree of hearing loss. The sections from the control group showed no histopathologic abnormalities while the sections from the study groups demonstrated vacuolisation in the epithelial cells of the spiral limbus, and the stria vascularis, vacuolisation of the fibroblasts and decreasing the number of the fibroblasts in the spiral limbus.
Taxol causes mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in mice. Histopathologically, there were degenerative changes in the cochlea resembling the ones that take place in salisylate and interferon alpha 2a ototoxicity which are thought to be reversible. There was no sensory cell loss. The hearing loss begins with doses less than or equal to 20mg/kg and is not dose dependent after this dose. Hearing monitorisation with audiologic evaluation is strongly recommended before and during the use of the drug in human subjects.
To describe the development of bradycardia during sedation with dexmedetomidine in a patient concurrently receiving digoxin.
Case report.
The pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care children's hospital.
A 5-wk-old infant with an atrioventricular septal defect requiring sedation during mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory syncytial virus infection.
As part of an ongoing evaluation of dexmedetomidine for sedation in the pediatric intensive care unit, the patient received a loading dose (0.5 microg/kg) followed by an infusion (0.44 microg x kg(-1) x hr(-1)) of dexmedetomidine. Sedation assessments and hemodynamic data were collected at least every 2 hrs. During the loading dose, the patient's heart rate decreased from 133 beats/min per min to 116 beats/min. During the ensuing 13 hrs, the heart rate continued to decrease into the mid 90s, with additional episodes of bradycardia into the 40s and 50s. Within 1 hr of discontinuation of the dexmedetomidine infusion, the baseline heart rate had recovered, and no further episodes of acute bradycardia were noted.
This case adds to the limited data regarding dexmedetomidine in pediatric critical care and suggests that caution should be used when considering sedation with dexmedetomidine in patients also receiving digoxin.
Understanding the molecular action of gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, might allow us to perform more effective therapies for hormone-independent advanced prostate cancer. A DNA microarray study was undertaken to comprehensively analyze the alteration of levels of 1,081 genes after gefitinib treatment in androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 cells and androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. The proliferation of PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells was significantly inhibited by 50.2%, 83.8% and 55.2%, respectively, 6 days after 10 microM gefitinib administration. Of the above 1,081 genes, we identified 23, 13 and 33 genes with significantly different expression in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells, respectively, 24 h after 10 microM-gefitinib exposure. Among the identified genes, only Quiescin Q6, a negative cell cycle regulator, was increased after gefitinib treatment in all three cell lines regardless of gefitinib sensitivity. Except for Quiescin Q6, there were no overlapping genes between PC3 and DU145 cells. However, levels of several oncogenes or proliferation-related genes were changed after gefitinib treatment in the 2 androgen-independent cell lines. We also identified 7 unique genes [glycyl-tRNA synthetase, interferon, alpha-inducible protein, stratifin, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1, dual specificity phosphatase 9, guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) beta polypeptide 2, neural retina leucine zipper] whose levels were altered exclusively after gefitinib administration in gefitinib-resistant PC3 and LNCaP cells, but not in DU145 cells, suggesting that these 7 genes could be targets for overcoming gefitinib resistance. Collectively, our molecular profiling data will serve as a framework for understanding the molecular action of gefitinib for prostate cancer.
Isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the aorta but without signs of improved endothelial function. The aim was to examine the hypothesis that increased expression of eNOS allosteric inhibitor caveolin-1 could be associated with unimproved endothelium-dependent relaxations. Rats received isoproterenol (5 mg/kg body mass, i.p., n = 13) or its vehicle (n = 14) during 1 week. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured by the tail-cuff method. Expression of eNOS and caveolin-1 was measured using immunoblotting analysis. Relaxations of isolated aorta to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were evaluated ex vivo. After 1 week of isoproterenol administration, basal SBP and HR were decreased (SBP 110 +/- 3 vs. 126 +/- 3 mmHg, p < 0.05; HR 342 +/- 8 vs. 366 +/- 6 beats/min, p < 0.05). Isoproterenol increased the mass of the left ventricle (+33% +/- 4% vs. control; p < 0.05) and right ventricle (+40% +/- 9%; p < 0.05). Isoproterenol administration increased the expression of eNOS (+53% +/- 12%; p < 0.05) and caveolin-1 (+54% +/- 20%, p < 0.05) in the aorta. Relaxation of isolated aorta to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside showed a trend towards a worsened endothelial function and a lower sensitivity to exogenous NO. Thus, 1 week of isoproterenol administration led to increased eNOS expression in the aorta without amelioration of endothelial vasorelaxation function. Concomitant increase in caveolin-1 expression may be responsible for this paradox.
We are reporting on a patient with a schizoaffective disorder (ICD 10:F25.1), whose catatonic symptoms deteriorated while receiving high-potency neuroleptic drugs in combination with anticholinergic medication. Initially there was a "catatonic dilemma", i.e. it was not possible to differentiate between the morbigenous and pharmacogenic (malignant neuroleptic syndrome) etiology of the catatonic symptoms. Catatonic symptoms were successfully treated with a combination of lorazepam and clozapine. The severe catatonic syndrome was found to be a neuroleptic-induced deterioration of a primary morbogenous catatonic syndrome. Thus, this case also suggests that the malignant neuroleptic syndrome and neuroleptic non-responsive catatonia may not be two different disease entities but that catatonia under neuroleptic medication is caused by the interaction of individual disposition, morbigenous and pharmacogenic factors.
The Small eye (Sey) gene in the mouse is lethal in the homozygous state. It is located on chromosome 2, is a mutation in the Pax-6 gene, and is genetically homologous with the human aniridia 2 (AN2) gene mutation. Numerous studies over the last few years, using genetic and molecular biological approaches, have investigated both the location of the gene as well as its possible mode of action. In the homozygous state, the primary defect appears to be limited to the failure of differentiation of the presumptive lens and nasal placodes. Such mice therefore display a characteristic phenotype; they possess neither eyes nor any nasal derivatives. Their heterozygous (Sey/+) and normal (+/+) littermates may be distinguished before birth only by a detailed examination of their eyes. Few detailed morphological/histological studies have been undertaken to date in the Sey/Sey embryos and newborn, and in the present study we describe a variety of craniofacial abnormalities that have not previously been reported. We observed, with one exception, delayed closure of the palate, and the presence in 80% of mice of an abnormal complement of upper incisor teeth, so that 35% possessed 1 supernumerary tooth while 45% possessed 2 supernumerary teeth. In these mice, a total of either 3 or 4, rather than the normal complement of 2, upper incisor teeth were present. Possibly the most unexpected finding, however, was the presence of a median cartilaginous rod-like structure which protruded between the 2 maxillae to give the Alizarin red S and Alcian blue-stained 'cleared' skulls of the newborn mice a characteristic 'unicorn-like' appearance. While this structure appeared to be a rostral extension of the chondrocranium, its exact derivation is unclear.
To identify Huntington's Disease therapeutics, we conducted high-content small molecule and RNAi suppressor screens using a Drosophila primary neural culture Huntingtin model. Drosophila primary neurons offer a sensitive readout for neurotoxicty, as their neurites develop dysmorphic features in the presence of mutant polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin compared to nonpathogenic Huntingtin. By tracking the subcellular distribution of mRFP-tagged pathogenic Huntingtin and assaying neurite branch morphology via live-imaging, we identified suppressors that could reduce Huntingtin aggregation and/or prevent the formation of dystrophic neurites. The custom algorithms we used to quantify neurite morphologies in complex cultures provide a useful tool for future high-content screening approaches focused on neurodegenerative disease models. Compounds previously found to be effective aggregation inhibitors in mammalian systems were also effective in Drosophila primary cultures, suggesting translational capacity between these models. However, we did not observe a direct correlation between the ability of a compound or gene knockdown to suppress aggregate formation and its ability to rescue dysmorphic neurites. Only a subset of aggregation inhibitors could revert dysmorphic cellular profiles. We identified lkb1, an upstream kinase in the mTOR/Insulin pathway, and four novel drugs, Camptothecin, OH-Camptothecin, 18Î²-Glycyrrhetinic acid, and Carbenoxolone, that were strong suppressors of mutant Huntingtin-induced neurotoxicity. Huntingtin neurotoxicity suppressors identified through our screen also restored viability in an in vivo Drosophila Huntington's Disease model, making them attractive candidates for further therapeutic evaluation.
A well documented case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is reported. The patient had unusual, life-threatening complications, consisting of cardiac arrhythmia, followed by cardiac arrest, dysphagia persisting for eight weeks and leading to aspiration pneumonia, seizures, and myoclonus following treatment with haloperidol. An 18-month outpatient follow-up has failed to reveal any residual neurologic or cardiovascular damage.
A case of dermatomyositis is reported in a 50-year-old woman receiving D-Penicillamine therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. There was no evidence of neoplasia on full investigation. Remission of dermatomyositis occurred on withdrawal of D-Penicillamine.
The lesions caused by excess oral pyridoxine hydrochloride (150 mg/kg body weight/day) and clioquinol (200 mg/kg body weight/day), given individually and in combination to adult Beagle dogs, were evaluated. The experimental period was 100 to 112 days, except that four dogs in each of the clioquinol and combined-treatment groups were killed early because of severe debilitation or neurologic disease, and one dog given both compounds died on the third day of compound administration. Degenerative neurologic lesions had distribution specific for the compound given. Pyridoxine-treated dogs had lesions limited to tracts and nerves with neuronal bodies of their nerve fibers in the spinal and trigeminal ganglia. Clioquinol-treated dogs had neurologic lesions limited to the central nervous system. The most lesions were in the rostral dorsal funiculus and distal aspects of the optic nerve fibers, but minimal to mild degenerative changes also occurred in distal aspects of the corticospinal and spinocerebellar tracts. Dogs given both pyridoxine hydrochloride and clioquinol had a combination of the lesions in dogs given pyridoxine or clioquinol individually. Several dogs given clioquinol or pyridoxine plus clioquinol had extraneural lesions, including myocardial degeneration and thyroidal alterations.
The clinical and clinicopathologic effects of excess oral pyridoxine hydrochloride (150 mg/kg body weight/day) and clioquinol (200 mg/kg body weight/day) alone and in combination were evaluated in adult Beagle dogs over an experimental period of approximately 100 days. Anorexia and loss of body weight occurred in the first weeks of the trial period in each treatment group, but was most severe in dogs given both compounds. Dogs in each treatment group (10 of 10 pyridoxine-treated dogs, 6 of 13 clioquinol-treated dogs and 12 of 13 pyridoxine plus clioquinol-treated dogs) developed neurologic disease, manifested principally by ataxia. Pyridoxine-treated dogs had proprioceptive loss involving both fore- and hindquarters, characterized by stiff, spastic, dysmetric leg movements. In clioquinol-treated dogs, dysmetric leg movements were accompanied by failure to support body weight in the hindquarters, but similar forelimb involvement occurred in severely affected dogs. The neurologic disease in dogs given both compounds varied; signs in some dogs resembled those of affected dogs of the pyridoxine-treated group, and in others, those in clioquinol-treated group. Erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin concentrations and packed cell volumes were reduced in dogs in each treatment group and were lowest in dogs given both compounds. Plasma protein was mildly reduced in dogs given pyridoxine or pyridoxine plus clioquinol. Few or no differences were present in the leukocyte counts, blood urea nitrogen concentrations, in activities of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and in concentrations of sodium, chloride or potassium in treated dogs as compared to control dogs.
Spasms in patients with generalized tetanus can be suppressed by a spinal intrathecal infusion of baclofen. We report on four patients and review reported cases treated by this method elsewhere.
Intrathecal baclofen infusion was started with a bolus dose (300-500 micrograms) and continued at a steady rate of 500-1000 micrograms/day. The dose was increased in daily steps as needed.
Doses of baclofen of 500, 1000, or 2000 micrograms/day were effective in three patients, while 1500 micrograms/day was insufficient in the fourth. Bradycardia and hypotonia occurred in one patient at a dose of 2000 micrograms/day but resolved after the dose was reduced to 1500 micrograms/day. Another patient developed hypotonia when a bolus of 500 micrograms was given after a steady infusion of 1500 micrograms/day. Voluntary movements were preserved in one and returned in two patients when sedation, induced by initial diazepam infusions, receded. The fourth patient needed diazepam during most of the treatment with intrathecal baclofen and required mechanical ventilation while being treated with baclofen.
A catheter position higher than T11 would possibly have yielded better results. It may be necessary to adapt the dose during the course of the illness. The preservation of respiratory drive and voluntary movements is the main advantage of treating tetanus with intrathecal baclofen. Additionally it helps to reduce sympathetic hyperactivity. Mortality may thereby be reduced.
Recently, sudden "sleep attacks" have been described in parkinsonian patients taking the nonergoline dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole. Due to this possible side effect, patients must be instructed not to drive vehicles and to refrain from other activities carrying the risk of self-injury. However, the very existence of sleep attacks remains controversial in sleep medicine, since a gradual transition from wakefulness to sleep is normally observed. Accordingly, sudden onset of sleep, e.g., in narcolepsy or sleep apnea syndrome, is usually associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Prevalence of sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness have been shown to be increased in Parkinson's disease. Nonergoline dopamine agonists are already known to induce somnolence. Currently, it is not predictable whether sleep attacks represent a sudden transition from wakefulness to sleep or result from an increased propensity to fall asleep, with patients perceiving a sudden onset. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms and legal implications of sleep attacks are discussed.
To develop in genetically engineered mice an alternative screening method for evaluation of P-glycoprotein substrate toxicosis in ivermectin-sensitive Collies.
14 wild-type C57BL/6J mice (controls) and 21 genetically engineered mice in which the abcb1a and abcb1b genes were disrupted and the mutated canine ABCB1 gene was inserted.
Mice were allocated to receive 10 mg of ivermectin/kg via SC injection (n = 30) or a vehicle-only formulation of propylene glycol and glycerol formal (5). Each was observed for clinical signs of toxic effects from 0 to 7 hours following drug administration.
After ivermectin administration, considerable differences were observed in drug sensitivity between the 2 types of mice. The genetically engineered mice with the mutated canine ABCB1 gene had signs of severe sensitivity to ivermectin, characterized by progressive lethargy, ataxia, and tremors, whereas the wild-type control mice developed no remarkable effects related to the ivermectin.
The ivermectin sensitivity modeled in the transgenic mice closely resembled the lethargy, stupor, disorientation, and loss of coordination observed in ivermectin-sensitive Collies with the ABCB1-1Î” mutation. As such, the model has the potential to facilitate toxicity assessments of certain drugs for dogs that are P-glycoprotein substrates, and it may serve to reduce the use of dogs in avermectin derivative safety studies that are part of the new animal drug approval process.
Although the findings from recent controlled studies suggest that methylphenidate is a safe and effective treatment for many children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comorbid tic disorder, relatively little is known about drug effects on school behavior. Thirty-four prepubertal children with ADHD and tic disorder received placebo and 3 doses of methylphenidate (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 weeks each under double-blind conditions. Treatment effects were assessed using direct observations of child behavior in classroom, lunchroom, and playground settings. Treatment with methylphenidate resulted in marked reductions of hyperactive, disruptive, and aggressive behavior, which was evident even for the 0.1 mg/kg dose. There were no "nonresponders." The only observed changes in tics were a small but statistically significant increase in the frequency of motor tics (classroom, 0.1 mg/kg dose) and a tendency for fewer vocal tics (lunchroom). However, these changes in motor tic frequency were not perceived by care providers as a worsening in the severity of the child's tic disorder. Most dose-response relationships were linear, but the mean (operationally defined) minimal effective dose (MED) was 0.3 mg/kg. In summary, the findings support the conclusions that (1) methylphenidate suppresses ADHD behaviors in the classroom and aggressive behavior in all settings and that (2) a low dose may have a weak exacerbation effect on the frequency of motor tics; but, in general, the majority of youngsters do not experience clinically significant tic worsening with a MED.
Recent studies have suggested that an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury enhances the expression of costimulatory adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of resveratrol, a phenolic product, on the renal function and expression of CD86 in rat kidneys with I/R injury. Wistar rats were divided into four groups; 1) an I/R group with right nephrectomy and 1-hour clamping of the left renal pedicle; 2) a vehicle group, I/R plus 10% ethanol (0.1 ml/kg/day) administered by intra-peritoneal injection from day -1 through to 7; 3) a resveratrol group, I/R plus 4 mg/kg/day of resveratrol; and 4) a sham group. Blood samples were obtained via the tail vein at 1 day before, and 1, 3, and 7 days after the operation (day 0) for the measurement of serum creatinine (Scr) levels. The expression of CD86 protein was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining, and the level of CD86 messenger RNA (mRNA) was evaluated quantitatively by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the renal cortex at day 3. Scr levels of the resveratrol group were significantly lower than those of the I/R and vehicle groups on days 1 and 3 after the operation. From the immunohistochemical study, the expression of CD86 in the glomerular endothelium and peritubular vessels was found to be attenuated in the resveratrol group compared with the I/R or vehicle group. In the resveratrol group, the CD86 mRNA level was significantly lower than that in the I/R or vehicle group, and it was significantly decreased by about one fifth of that in the sham group. Our results suggest that resveratrol markedly reduces renal dysfunction and attenuates the mRNA and protein expression of CD86 following I/R injury.
Early environmental events have profound influences on a wide range of adult behavior. In the current study, we assessed the influence of maternal stress during gestation on psychostimulant and neurochemical responsiveness to cocaine, cocaine self-administration, and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in adult offspring. Pregnant, female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to either no treatment or to restraint stress three times per day for the last 7 days of gestation and cocaine-related behavior was assessed in offspring at 10 weeks of age. Relative to controls, a noncontingent cocaine injection elevated locomotor activity as well as nucleus accumbens levels of extracellular dopamine and glutamate to a greater extent in both cocaine-naive and cocaine-experienced prenatal stress (PNS) rats and elevated prefrontal cortex dopamine in cocaine-experienced PNS rats. To assess the impact of PNS on cocaine addiction-related behavior, rats were trained to lever press for intravenous (i.v.) infusions of cocaine (0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg/infusion), with each infusion paired with a light+tone-conditioned stimulus. Lever-pressing was extinguished and cocaine-seeking reinstated by re-exposure to the conditioned cues or by intraperitoneal cocaine-priming injections (5 or 10 mg/kg). PNS elevated active lever responding both during extinction and cocaine-primed reinstatement, but not during self-administration or conditioned-cued reinstatement. PNS also did not alter intake during self-administration. These findings demonstrate that PNS produces enduring nervous system alterations that increase the psychomotor stimulant, motivational, and neurochemical responsiveness to noncontingent cocaine. Thus, early environmental factors contribute to an individual's initial responsiveness to cocaine and propensity to relapse to cocaine-seeking.
