To evaluate the hemodynamic effects of tolazoline and prostacyclin in infants with pulmonary vasospasm after cardiac surgery.
Prospective cohort study.
Pediatric ICU.
The cohort consisted of 42 infants and children with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension who underwent corrective surgery and were monitored postoperatively using pulmonary artery catheters. Fourteen infants (2 to 12 months old) in this group required postoperative treatment with tolazoline or prostacyclin.
Tolazoline was administered as a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg for treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension or acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis. If its effectiveness was proved after 30 mins by hemodynamic measurements, a continuous iv infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/hr was established. Higher doses of tolazoline were avoided. If tolazoline treatment did not fulfill the criteria for pulmonary vasodilation, prostacyclin was given by continuous iv infusion at a starting rate of 5 ng/kg/min, followed by 10 ng/kg/min. In three patients, the infusion rate was increased to 15 ng/kg/min.
Bolus administration of tolazoline resulted in a distinct pulmonary vasodilation in seven infants: mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by an average of 35% and 45%, respectively. In these patients, tolazoline was infused over the following 12 to 72 hrs. One infant who received tolazoline for 72 hrs developed a clinically important gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In seven nonresponders to tolazoline, prostacyclin (PGI2) at an infusion rate of 5 ng/kg/min led to pulmonary vasodilation in five patients, at an iv infusion rate of 10 ng/kg/min in all seven infants studied. The latter dose of PGI2 reduced the mean pulmonary artery pressure by an average of 37%, and pulmonary vascular resistance by 43%. Transient withdrawal of prostacyclin in five infants demonstrated its short half-life and clinical effectiveness. Apart from a facial flush, no side-effects were encountered using PGI2 as an infusion over durations ranging from 12 to 504 hrs.
These data suggest that, if tolazoline in a relatively low dose proves to be inefficient, prostacyclin can still be used as a safe and effective drug for treatment of pulmonary vasospasm. Prostacyclin offers more than a pharmacologic alternative to increased tolazoline dosages.
Chronic combined administration of 5-HT1A receptor antagonist NAN-190 and 17beta-estradiol improved conditioned passive avoidance performance in middle-aged ovariectomized rats with scopolamine-induced amnesia. Our results suggest that the ovarian hormonal, cholinergic, and serotoninergic systems play a role in age-related cognitive disturbances under conditions of hypoestrogenic syndrome.
Effect of AF102B (cis-2-methylspiro-(1,3-oxathiolane-5,3')-quinuclidine) on experimental amnesia was examined using a passive avoidance task in rodents. The amnesia was produced by anti-cholinergic agents, AF64A (intracerebroventricularly) and scopolamine (subcutaneously). AF102B ameliorated the memory deficits in AF64A-treated rats at 0.1-1 mg/kg, i.p. and at 1-5 mg/kg p.o. and in scopolamine-treated mice at 1-10 mg/kg, i.p. These results suggest that AF102B may compensate for central cholinergic defects and could be developed as a possible therapeutic drug for senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
A 33-year-old woman suffering from endometriosis was admitted to our hospital because of acute-onset diplopia and gait instability. She had a low-grade fever and cough 7 days before admission. On admission, she had left eye deviation downward on the inside, bilateral upper gaze impairment, and left Barrés sign with myoclonic-like movement of the left hand. MRI with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed high signal intensity in the right thalamus. The lesion had low signal intensity on an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, indicating cytotoxic edema. Although the presence of antecedent infection and moderate inflammatory changes shown by blood analysis prevented exclusion of inflammatory disorders such as cerebral angitis or acute disseminating encephalomyelitis, cerebral infarction was strongly suspected. The patient was treated with the free radical scavenger edaravone and high-dose dexamethasone; antiplatelet treatment was not used because of menstrual bleeding. Activation of coagulo-fibrinolytic system such as the elevated plasma level of D-dimer was present, and a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogue (leuprorelin) had been administered 4 days before hospitalization. This circumstance suggests the possibility that treatment with an LH-RH analogue may cause ischemic stroke in young women.
A primary hepatic tumour occurred in a 21-year-old woman who had been taking oral contraceptives for two years; she was treated by partial hepatectomy. Part of the neoplasm showed features suggestive of focal nodular hyperplasia, while the remainder had the histological characteristics of a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. This is the first report of malignant transformation of a tumour in a patient taking oral contraceptives.
A 35-year-old man developed a distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy after taking disulfiram, 500 mg daily for five months. His symptoms improved after the drug therapy was discontinued. Clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological observations during the acute stage and during recovery suggest that disulfiram produces a distal axonopathy.
Following allergen exposure, cytokines and other pro-inflammatory signals play an important role in the immunological cascade leading to allergic sensitization. Inflammasomes sense exogenous and endogenous danger signals and trigger IL-1β and IL-18 activation which in turn shape Th2 responses. Honey bee venom (BV) allergies are very common; however, the local inflammatory cascade leading to the initiation of allergic sensitization is poorly understood. In this study, the local inflammatory cascades in skin after exposure to BV were investigated.
The mechanisms of inflammasome activation in human skin and in cultured keratinocytes upon BV exposure were analyzed by ELISA, Western blot, flow cytometry, siRNA techniques, and immunofluorescence.
In an ex vivo bee sting model, BV induced IL-1β release suggesting the activation of inflammasomes. Indeed, in cultured keratinocytes, the BV component melittin triggered IL-1β and IL-18 release via the AIM2 inflammasome. AIM2 is a cytosolic DNA receptor, and mitochondrial as well as genomic DNA was detected in the cytosol of melittin-treated keratinocytes as triggers of inflammasome activation. As a mechanism, melittin mediated destruction of mitochondrial membranes leading to the leakage of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosolic compartment.
These data suggest that upon BV exposure, keratinocytes are involved in an innate immune response by the activation of the AIM2 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β and IL-18 release triggered by endogenous DNA. As IL-1β and IL-18 are involved in Th2- and IgE-mediated immune reactions, these results could add to the understanding of the role of the tissue microenvironment to subsequent allergic responses.
The anticholinergic properties of currently available antidepressants sometimes cause sexual dysfunction. Bethanechol, a cholinergic drug, was found to give total relief of impotence in two men and of anorgasmy in one woman; none of the subjects suffered side effects.
Cocaine-associated stroke (CAS) is an important cause of disability, especially among younger adults. Improved management has increased survival but little has been discussed about rehabilitation, including medication management. Therefore, experience and therapeutic drug management are described during inpatient rehabilitation with three patients with CAS. Case 14 is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with right hemiparesis, aphasia and depression. He was treated with paroxetine for depression and bromocriptine for poor initiation with a good response, improving by 50 FIM points in 44 days. Case 2 is a 44 year-old female with quadriparesis, aphasia, and deficits in attention and initiation. Methylphenidate for attention deficits and bromocriptine for poor initiation was associated with an excellent functional gain (50 FIM points in 37 days). She eventually returned to work. Case 3 is a 46-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with right hemiparesis, aphasia and depression. Without neuropharmacologic intervention, she gained 35 FIM points during an uneventful 47 day rehabilitation stay. Acutely, cocaine can induce cerebral vasoconstriction, cerebrovascular spasm, cerebral vasculitis and intracerebral haemorrhage. Chronic use depletes and destroys dopaminergic pathways, which may be a major factor in depression, and attention and initiation deficits-all observed in these cases. Generally, rapid improvements were seen in mood and cognition in two cases where medication was used. Based on the current literature and pathophysiology of CAS, it is suggested that trials of dopaminergic agents for cognition and extremely cautious use of buproprion for depression may be warrented. Details of the above cases and the practical and theoretical issues of neuropharmacologic intervention in CAS are discussed.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic agent which has been used to treat many solid tumors including cancers of the breast, ovary, cervix, bladder, prostate gland and gastrointestinal tract. Side effects related to the drug include bone marrow suppression, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. However another less frequent but lethal event cardiotoxicity--appears to have been ignored by physicians. Recently, two cases of cardiac toxicity induced by 5-FU have been encountered here. One patient developed supraventricular tachycardia and the other illustrated silent myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure. Since these side effects may result in death when 5-FU is prescribed to those patients who have had previous heart disease or are concomitantly receiving inevitable radiotherapy over the cardiac region, it should be recommended with extreme caution.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and its derivatives have been used worldwide for the treatment of several malignancies in solid organs. The effectiveness of these drugs is well proven in gastrointestinal malignancy, and has been reported upon the inverse correlation with the tumoral expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). However, the significance of DPD expression in 5-FU based chemotherapy has not been well investigated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We examined enzymatic activities and immunohistochemical expression of thymidylate synthase (TS) and DPD in 84 cases of NSCLC. In vitro sensitivity for 5-FU was tested in 53 cases of them to evaluate these predictive values for effectiveness of 5-FU. Efficacy of 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP), potent DPD inhibitor, was also examined in 27 cases of them. There was a reversal correlation between protein expression of DPD and sensitivity to 5-FU (r = -0.65; p < 0.001). Six (33.3%) of 18 cases with strong expression of DPD showed 10% or more increment of the anti-tumor effect by adding CDHP to 5-FU. DPD inhibitory fluoropyrimidine and examination of the tumoral expression of DPD might be a promising chemotherapeutic strategy in NSCLC.
The authors describe a 62-year-old woman with symptoms of major depression presumed to be secondary to propranolol use. The patient responded poorly to imipramine; however, her symptoms cleared rapidly when atenolol was substituted for propranolol.
The development of novel in vitro methods to assess risks of allergic sensitization are essential in reducing animal testing whilst maintaining consumer safety. The main research objectives of this study were to identify novel biomarkers to assess the sensitization predictability of chemicals. Phenotypic and cytokine responses of moDCs and MUTZ-3 cells were investigated following application of contact sensitizers; dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), cinnamaldehyde (Cin), eugenol (E), isoeugenol (IE), P-phenylenediamine (PPD) and non-sensitizers; salicyclic acid (SA) and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). CD86 was up-regulated on MUTZ-3 cells in response to DNCB, Cin and PPD, however, moDCs only modulated CD86 in response to DNCB and E. PDL-1 (Programmed death receptor ligand-1) proved a promising sensitization biomarker in MUTZ-3 cells where up-regulation occurred in response to DNCB, Cin, IE and PPD. Additionally, moDC-expressed PDL-1 was modulated in response to Cin, IE and E thus demonstrating improved sensitizer predictability when compared with CD86. MCP-1 and RANTES were identified as biomarkers of DNCB exposure but MCP-1 did not show any change in expression above controls for the other sensitizers investigated. However, RANTES was increased in MUTZ-3 cells by both DNCB and Cin. Our findings highlight novel biomarkers which, in MUTZ-3 cells, could be taken forward within a multiple biomarker in vitro assay ensuring strong and reliable predictability.
This study compared the therapeutic efficacy of thioridazine, loxapine, and a placebo in the treatment of behavioral disturbances in nursing home patients with dementia. Antipsychotic medications were effective for the specific behavioral problems of anxiety, excitement, emotional lability, and uncooperativeness. Subjects with the most severe symptoms at baseline assessment derived the greatest benefit from treatment. Sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and decreased blood pressure were common side effects among patients treated with the antipsychotic drugs. The authors conclude that antipsychotic medication has a definite but limited therapeutic role in the treatment of behavioral disturbances in nursing home patients with dementia.
To estimate associations between use of specific agricultural pesticides and incident diabetes in women.
We used data from the Agricultural Health Study, a large prospective cohort of pesticide applicators and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina. For comparability with previous studies of farmers, we limited analysis to 13 637 farmers' wives who reported ever personally mixing or applying pesticides at enrolment (1993-1997), who provided complete data on required covariates and diabetes diagnosis and who reported no previous diagnosis of diabetes at enrolment. Participants reported ever-use of 50 specific pesticides at enrolment and incident diabetes at one of two follow-up interviews within an average of 12 years of enrolment. We fit Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time scale and adjusting for state and body mass index to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for each of the 45 pesticides with sufficient users.
Five pesticides were positively associated with incident diabetes (n=688; 5%): three organophosphates, fonofos (HR=1.56, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.19), phorate (HR=1.57, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.16) and parathion (HR=1.61, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.46); the organochlorine dieldrin (HR=1.99, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.54); and the herbicide 2,4,5-T/2,4,5-TP (HR=1.59, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.51). With phorate and fonofos together in one model to account for their correlation, risks for both remained elevated, though attenuated compared with separate models.
Results are consistent with previous studies reporting an association between specific organochlorines and diabetes and add to growing evidence that certain organophosphates also may increase risk.
The neuroprotective effects of carnosic acid (CA), a phenolic diterpene isolated from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), have been widely investigated in recent years, however, its protection in in vivo still unclear. In this study, we investigated the behavioral activity and neuroprotective effects of CA in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Rats were treated with 20mg/kg body weight of CA for 3 weeks before 6-OHDA exposure. Results indicated that CA improved the locomotor activity and reduced the apomorphine-caused rotation in 6-OHDA-stimulated rats. Significant protection against lipid peroxidation and GSH reduction was observed in the 6-OHDA rats pretreated with CA. Pretreatment with CA increased the protein expression of γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase compared with 6-OHDA-stimulated rats and SH-SY5Y cells. Immunoblots showed that the reduction of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, the induction of caspase 3 cleavage, and the induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage by 6-OHDA was reversed in the presence of SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) or SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) in SH-SY5Y cells. Rats treated with CA reversed the 6-OHDA-mediated the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38, the down-regulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, the up-regulation of cleaved caspase 3/caspase 3 and cleaved PARP/PARP ratio, and the down-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase protein. However, BAM7, an activator of Bax, attenuated the effect of CA on apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggest that CA protected against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity is attributable to its anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative action. The present findings may help to clarify the possible mechanisms of rosemary in the neuroprotection of PD.
The objective of this study was to compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Estimates of lipid modification achieved due to drug therapy were based on published head-to-head comparisons of specific HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates in randomized, double-blind studies. We used a validated coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention computer model to estimate the costs and benefits of lifelong lipid modification. The patients were middle-aged men and women who were free of CHD, with either primary type IIa or IIb hyperlipidemia. The intervention used were specific HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates at several dosages, which reduced total cholesterol 11-34% and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 1-29%. The main outcome measure was the cost per year of life saved after discounting benefits and costs by 5% annually. The lifetime cost effectiveness of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin) and fibrates (bezafibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia varied according to patient population, the effectiveness of each drug in modifying lipid levels, and the price of each drug. The estimates of cost per year of life saved for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors range from $19,886 to $73,632, and $16,955 to $59,488 for fibrates according to gender and type of primary hyperlipidemia. Fluvastatin 20 mg/day was significantly more cost effective than gemfibrozil 1200 mg/day for male patients with type IIa hyperlipidemia. Simvastatin 17.3 mg/day or 20 mg/day yielded similar cost-effectiveness ratios compared with fibrates among type II hyperlipidemic patients. However, micronized fenofibrate was more cost effective than simvastatin 20 mg/day among type IIb patients. The cost effectiveness of lipid therapy varies widely and can be maximized by selecting specific drugs for specific lipid abnormalities.
There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are involved in prostate cancer susceptibility. We have studied the association of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HEPSIN gene (HPN) with prostate cancer in men of European ancestry. HPN is a likely candidate in prostate cancer susceptibility, as it encodes a transmembrane cell surface serum protease, which is overexpressed in prostate cancer; HPN is also located on 19q11-q13.2, where linkage is found with prostate cancer susceptibility. In this case-control association study (590 men with histologically verified prostate cancer and 576 unrelated controls, all of European descent), we find significant allele frequency differences between cases and controls at five SNPs that are located contiguously within the gene. A major 11-locus haplotype is significantly associated, which provides further support that HPN is a potentially important candidate gene involved in prostate cancer susceptibility. Association of one of the SNPs with Gleason score is also suggestive of a plausible role of HPN in tumor aggressiveness.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is currently considered a worldwide epidemic and finding effective therapeutic strategies against this disease is highly important. A deoxynojirimycin-polysaccharide mixture (DPM) has previously been shown to exert hypoglycemic effects on alloxan- or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism(s) of DPM on T2DM induced by high fat diet following low-dose STZ treatment in mice. After daily oral treatment of diabetic mice with DPM (150 mg/kg b.w.) for 90 d, significant decline in blood glucose, pyruvate, triglyceride (TG), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine (Cr), lipid peroxide (LPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as well as evident increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL-c) and hepatic glycogen concentrations were observed. In the first stage, in which DPM was administered for 60 d, blood insulin levels did not undergo significant change but a significant decrease in the HOMA-IR index was detected. By contrast, the HOMA-IR index increased significantly in T2MD controls. In the second stage, in which DPM treatment was continued for another 30 d, insulin levels significantly increased in DPM-treated mice in comparison with T2DM controls. These results indicate that insulin resistance in the pre-diabetic period and the dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells are ameliorated by DPM treatment. DPM also down-regulated protein levels of insulin receptor (IR) and gluconeogenic enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase) in peripheral tissues (liver and/or muscle), but enhanced the expressions of insulin in pancreas, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and glycolysis enzymes (glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, private kinase and pyruvate decarboxylase E1) in the liver. Furthermore, deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and polysaccharide (P) were found to increase proliferation of hepatic LO-2 cells and scavenging of radicals in vitro. These results support the results of our biochemical analyses and underscore possible mechanisms underlying the protective effects of DPM on STZ-induced damage to the pancreas and the liver. Taken together, our findings suggest that DPM may be developed as an antihyperglycemic agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
Fentanyl given in a low dose of 25 microgram/kg (ip) evoked a marked muscle rigidity measured directly by a mechanographic method in non-anesthetized rats. The selective 5HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg ip) showed only a tendency to attenuate the natural muscle tone. However, when that compound was given 40 min before (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg ip) or 20 min after (1.0 mg/kg ip) fentanyl, it abolished the muscle rigidity. It is concluded that the serotonergic transmission, possibly via 5HT1A receptors, may participate in elucidation of the mechanism(s) of the fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity. These results seem to be clinically important in case other 5HT1A agonists, buspirone or gepirone (potent anxiolytics), also prevented fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity in humans.
Interstitial cystitis is a painful bladder disease characterized by urgency, frequency and variable inflammation but there is no curative therapy. Suplatast tosilate (IPD-1151T) is an immunoregulatory compound that decreases interstitial cystitis symptoms but to our knowledge its mechanism of action is unknown. We investigated the effect of intravesical IPD-1151T on mediator release from bladder explants in experimental cystitis.
A catheter was inserted into the bladder of female mice. After urine was emptied normal saline, carbachol (100 nM) or lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/ml) was introduced with or without 10-minute pretreatment with IPD-1151T. Urine was removed after 45 minutes for histamine and tumor necrosis factor-alpha assays. The bladder was removed after 4 hours, minced into 1 mm2 pieces and cultured with or without triggers overnight for mediator release. The effect of IPD-1151T was also tested on rat skin vascular permeability as well as on purified rat peritoneal mast cells and human cord blood derived mast cells.
Carbachol significantly increased histamine release in urine (61.3% in 8 preparations, p<0.05) but not in explant medium. IPD-1151T inhibited this effect by 77%. Lipopolysaccharide induced a 350% urine histamine increase in 9 preparations (p<0.05) and a 300% tumor necrosis factor-alpha increase in explant medium. IPD-1151T inhibited the lipopolysaccharide induced medium tumor necrosis factor-alpha increase by 95% in 5 preparations (p<0.05). IPD-1151T did not inhibit rat skin vascular permeability or purified rat peritoneal mast cell activation by compound 48/80 or human cord blood derived mast cells by anti-IgE.
IPD-1151T inhibits bladder release of histamine and tumor necrosis factor-alpha through a mechanism that does not appear to involve direct mast cell inhibition. These findings may justify a beneficial effect of IPD-1151T in interstitial cystitis.
Endometriosis is a frequent benign gynecological disease characterized by endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. The estimated prevalence in the general population is 6-10%, but this reaches 30-50% in women with infertility and/or pain. As ectopic tissue within the pelvic cavity provokes inflammation, endometriosis is also considered a chronic inflammatory disease, and is characterized by increased peritoneal fluid levels of prostaglandin (PG)E2 and PGF2α. The AKR1B1 and AKR1C3 enzymes act as PG synthases and catalyze reduction of PGH2 to PGF2α, and PGD2 to 9α,11β-PGF2α, respectively. AKR1B1 and AKR1C3 may thus be associated with increased PGF2α production in endometriosis patients, as supported by our previous report of increased AKR1C1-AKR1C3 mRNA levels in endometriotic tissue, compared to control endometrium. Here, we initially evaluated PGF2α concentrations in peritoneal fluid from endometriosis patients and healthy women. We also examined expression of AKR1B1, AKR1C3 and other genes involved in PGF2α biosynthesis, metabolism, and action in ovarian endometriosis tissue versus healthy endometrium, and in peritoneal endometriosis and control endometrium model cell lines. Compared to controls, increased PGF2α concentrations in peritoneal fluid of patients were supported by endometriotic tissue showing increased AKR1B1 mRNA and protein levels, but unchanged AKR1C3 protein levels. Among genes involved in PGF2α biosynthesis, metabolism and action PLA2G2A, PTGS2/COX-2, ABCC4 and PTGFR were up-regulated, mRNA levels of SLCO2A, PTGDS and HPGDS were unchanged, and genes PLA2G4A and HPGD were down-regulated in diseased tissue. All of these PGF2α-associated genes were also expressed in control endometrial HIEEC epithelial and HIESC stromal cell lines, and in peritoneal endometriosis 12-Z epithelial and 22-B stromal cell lines. Higher expression of PLA2G2A, PTGS2, AKR1B1, AKR1C3 and ABCC4 was seen in 22-B endometriosis cells compared to HIESC control cells. These cell models characterized in this study will enable further investigations into the role of PGF2α in the pathophysiology of endometriosis and the involvement of AKR1B1 and AKR1C3.
Newly hatched mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) were exposed in a 96-h static renewal assay to water-accommodated fractions of dispersed crude oil (DWAF) or crude oil (WAF) to evaluate if the dispersant-induced changes in aqueous concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) affected larval survival, body length, or ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity. Weathered Mesa light crude oil (0.05-1 g/L) and filtered seawater with or without the addition of Corexit 9500 were used to prepare DWAF and WAE At 0.2 g/L, the addition of dispersant caused a two- and fivefold increase in the concentrations of total PAH (sigmaPAH) and high-molecular-weight PAH (HMWPAH) with three or more benzene rings. Highest mortality rates (89%) were observed in larvae exposed to DWAF (0.5 g/L; sigmaPAH, 479 ng/ml). A reduction in body length was correlated with increased levels of sigmaPAH (r2 = 0.65, p = 0.02) and not with HMWPAH. The EROD activity increased linearly with HMWPAH (r2 = 0.99, p = 0.001) and not with sigmaPAH. Thus, chemical dispersion increased both the sigmaPAH concentrations and the proportion of HMWPAH in WAF. Dispersed HMWPAH were bioavailable, as indicated by a significantly increased EROD activity in exposed mummichog larvae, and this may represent a significant hazard for larval fish.
In acute pancreatitis, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) might be released by lipase and cause tissue necrosis by their detergent properties, but this has not been established in vivo.
To measure the release of NEFA in the blood stream, pancreatic tissue, and peritoneal cavity during taurocholate-induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats.
Ascites and blood were repeatedly sampled; after 24 hours, pancreatic lesions were scored, and NEFA were measured in the pancreas. The effects of a specific lipase inhibitor (Tetrahydrolipstatin [THL]) were also studied.
A slight transient increase (22%) of NEFA concentration was observed in systemic circulation but did not parallel the time course of lipase activity, arguing against an intravascular production of NEFA by circulating lipase. Pancreatic NEFA did not differ between rats with pancreatitis and control rats. NEFA in ascites increased to threefold the basal value immediately after taurocholate and decreased rapidly thereafter, whereas lipase increased later in ascites and remained elevated during the 24-hour duration of the experiment. Lipase inhibition by THL neither modified the early increase of NEFA in ascites, nor altered the macroscopic, enzymatic, and histologic evolution of pancreatitis.
This in vivo study does not confirm the hypothetical role of NEFA produced by pancreatic lipase in the necrotic process and its systemic complications, up to now mainly suggested on the basis of ex vivo experiments.
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on venous capacitance during controlled hypotension. Trinitroglycerin (TNG) was used as a control agent. In rats anesthetized with ketamine, mean arterial pressure was lowered to 70 mmHg and subsequently 50 mmHg by intravenous infusion of PGE1 or TNG. Venous capacitance was assessed before and during induced hypotension by measuring the mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP). MCFP was measured after briefly arresting the circulation by inflating an indwelling balloon in the right atrium. MCFP was significantly decreased by PGE1 from 7.9 +/- 0.3 to 6.9 +/- 0.3 mmHg at mean arterial pressure of 70 mmHg and to 6.9 +/- 0.2 mmHg at mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg. The decrease in MCFP by PGE1 at mean arterial pressure of 70 mmHg was not significantly different from TNG. However, the decrease in MCFP by PGE1 at mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg was significantly less than that by TNG. The results suggest that the venous capacitance may be increased by PGE1 to a similar degree with TNG at doses to produce a comparable level of moderate hypotension, but the increase in venous capacitance may be less in PGE1 than TNG at doses to produce deep hypotension.
Psoriasis is often treated with agents that activate nuclear hormone receptors for glucocorticoids, retinoids, and vitamin D. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a related nuclear hormone receptor that can be activated by its ligands, including the thiazolidinediones.
To assess whether treatment with troglitazone, a currently available thiazolidinedione used to treat diabetes mellitus, has an effect on psoriasis in normoglycemic patients and whether ligands for PPARgamma have an effect on models of psoriasis.
Open-label administration of troglitazone in patients with psoriasis and evaluation of drug actions in cellular, organ, and transplant models of psoriasis.
University and community hospital outpatient departments and university laboratories.
Patients with chronic, stable plaque psoriasis and control subjects. Five patients with psoriasis received troglitazone (none withdrew); 10 different untreated patients and 10 controls provided tissue samples.
Oral troglitazone therapy at various dosages in patients with psoriasis; also, use of troglitazone, ciglitazone, and 15-deoxy-delta-12,14-prostaglandinJ2 in psoriasis models.
Investigator-determined clinical results in patients and cell counts and histological evidence in models.
All patients' psoriasis improved substantially during troglitazone therapy. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma was expressed in human keratinocytes; ligands for PPARgamma inhibited the proliferation of normal and psoriatic human keratinocytes in culture. Troglitazone treatment normalized the histological features of psoriatic skin in organ culture and reduced the epidermal hyperplasia of psoriasis in the severe combined immunodeficient mouse and human skin transplant model of psoriasis (P<.05 compared with untreated controls).
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma might be a useful intracellular target for the treatment of psoriasis; further study is needed to assess the clinical value of ligands for PPARgamma, including troglitazone.
Twenty patients admitted to hospital with serious lower respiratory tract infections entered an open study of 400 mg enoxacin given orally twice a day for a minimum of seven days. Clinical signs and symptoms were completely cured or improved in six of eight patients with pneumonia, in nine of ten patients with bronchitis, and in two patients with bronchiectasis. Enoxacin was effective in eradicating the initial pathogens in 10 of 12 patients with positive cultures. Enoxacin was well tolerated. Only one treatment-related side-effect was observed during the study. Nine patients received concurrent treatment with theophylline, but no signs of theophylline toxicity were seen. Enoxacin is a safe and effective alternative to parenteral treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
