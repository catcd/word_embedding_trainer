Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the red nucleus (RN) of rat decreased apomorphine-induced stereotypy, increased haloperidol-induced catalepsy, reversed apomorphine-induced hypothermy, decreased spiroperidol-induced hypomotility, and BHT-920-induced yawning and penile erection episodes. Moreover, apomorphine antagonized haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the RN-lesioned group. The lesioned animals revealed depleted levels of dopamine and its metabolites in brain areas as well as serotonin and its metabolite. The brain areas analyzed were pyriform cortex, substantia nigra, striatum, enthorinal cortex, and cerebellum. Based on these results, it is very likely that the RN has a complex role in the behavior of rats as a consequence of dopaminergic-serotoninergic changes in the central nervous system.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential protective effect of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on the norepinephrine (NE)-induced acute renal failure (ARF). After determination of basal renal function, ANF at different doses induced a dose dependent increase of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), diuresis (V), sodium (UNaV) and potassium (UKV) excretion. Unilateral intrarenal norepinephrine infusion induced acute renal failure in an isotonic saline pretreated rat group. The experimental kidney in this group was anuric, and no measurable GFR and electrolyte excretion was observed. ANF pretreatment prevented the norepinephrine-induced ARF. In the experimental kidney, GFR, V, UNa V and UK V were subnormal or even elevated during NE-infusion as compared to the basal clearance period. During the 60 min control period after the norepinephrine infusion in the isotonic saline pretreated rat group, anuria persisted. In the ANF pretreated groups, normal or significantly increased levels of GFR, V, UNa V and UK V were obtained.
The effect of the prophylactic application of the paramunity inducer Baypamun on the incidence of diseases among foals (n = 63) in four Thoroughbred studs was evaluated. In a blind study, 38 of the foals received 2 ml of Baypamun intramuscularly while 25 of the foals received a placebo at six and four days before weaning and on the fifth day post-weaning. During the observation period of three weeks, beginning with the first and ending ten days after the last application, 7.9% of the foals treated with Baypamun (3 out of 38) suffered from respiratory infections compared to 24% of the foals treated with placebo (6 out of 25). The blood plasma cortisol concentrations were also measured in 53 of the foals of three studs before and 24 hours after weaning. The cortisol concentration increased in all the foals. However, the increase was significant only for the Baypamun treated foals of one stud while it was significant for the placebo treated foals of all studs (p < 0.01).
Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cysteine-rich protein the synthesis and secretion of which are hypothesized to be selectively regulated by activins and other members of the TGF-β superfamily. To investigate the in vivo roles of CTGF in female reproduction, we generated Ctgf ovarian and uterine conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Ctgf cKO mice exhibit severe subfertility and multiple reproductive defects including disrupted follicle development, decreased ovulation rates, increased numbers of corpus luteum, and smaller but functionally normal uterine horns. Steroidogenesis is disrupted in the Ctgf cKO mice, leading to increased levels of serum progesterone. We show that disrupted follicle development is accompanied by a significant increase in granulosa cell apoptosis. Moreover, despite normal cumulus expansion, Ctgf cKO mice exhibit a significant decrease in oocytes ovulated, likely due to impaired ovulatory process. During analyses of mRNA expression, we discovered that Ctgf cKO granulosa cells show gene expression changes similar to our previously reported granulosa cell-specific knockouts of activin and Smad4, the common TGF-β family intracellular signaling protein. We also discovered a significant down-regulation of Adamts1, a progesterone-regulated gene that is critical for the remodeling of extracellular matrix surrounding granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles. These findings demonstrate that CTGF is a downstream mediator in TGF-β and progesterone signaling cascades and is necessary for normal follicle development and ovulation.
Only rarely have serious side effects been reported with the use of intravenous dipyridamole. We describe two cases of severe bradycardia, of which one led to asystole, in patients undergoing dipyridamole-thallium studies. The association between beta blocker therapy and the seven reported cases of asystole with dipyridamole is discussed and mechanisms postulated. Some caution is advised when patients on beta blockers or similar medications have dipyridamole-thallium studies.
A 63-year-old man with chronic renal failure who had received hemodialysis three times per week for 4 years developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome 10 days after taking amoxapine. His condition was characterized by muscle rigidity, elevation of body temperature and altered consciousness. Although he was treated with dantrolen and supportive care as well as discontinuation of amoxapine, his condition rapidly deteriorated, resulting in death. Because the pharmacokinetics of drugs, especially those such as antidepressants, in patients with chronic renal failure has not been fully clarified, one should be careful about giving such patients these drugs.
We have previously shown the hepatic gene expression profiles of carcinogens in 28-day toxicity tests were clustered into three major groups (Group-1 to 3). Here, we developed a new prediction method for Group-1 carcinogens which consist mainly of genotoxic rat hepatocarcinogens. The prediction formula was generated by a support vector machine using 5 selected genes as the predictive genes and predictive score was introduced to judge carcinogenicity. It correctly predicted the carcinogenicity of all 17 Group-1 chemicals and 22 of 24 non-carcinogens regardless of genotoxicity. In the dose-response study, the prediction score was altered from negative to positive as the dose increased, indicating that the characteristic gene expression profile emerged over a range of carcinogen-specific doses. We conclude that the prediction formula can quantitatively predict the carcinogenicity of Group-1 carcinogens. The same method may be applied to other groups of carcinogens to build a total system for prediction of carcinogenicity.
The acute, reciprocal dose-response interactions between delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC; 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg; IG) and each of three stimulants - d-amphetamine (dA; 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg; IP), cocaine (COC; 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg; IP), and nicotine (NIC; 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg; IP) were studied for their effects on performance of a conditioned avoidance response (CAR), photocell activity, heart rate, body temperature, and rotarod performance. delta9-THC impaired CAR and rotarod performance, depressed photocell activity, and decreased heart rate and body temperature. None of the three stimulants influenced CAR performance, but dA and COC increased the number of intertrial responses, and this latter effect was partially antagonized by delta9-THC. dA and COC, but not NIC, stimulated photocell activity. delta9-THC completely blocked this effect of dA, whereas there was mutual antagonism between delta9-THC and COC on this measure and NIC markedly potentiated the depression caused by delta9-THC. dA and COC tended to offset the impairment of rotarod performance caused by delta9-THC, whereas NIC augmented it. The bradycardia and hypothermia caused by delta9-THC tended to be augmented by these stimulants, especially NIC. The interactions were also studied after subacute treatment for six days with delta9-THC and/or each of the three stimulants. There was evidence for tolerance to the effects of delta9-THC on all measures and this tolerance generally resulted in less interactive effects between delta9-THC and the stimulants. Little or no tolerance was seen for the effects of the three stimulants or their interaction with delta9-THC. The time course of radioactivity derived from 14C-delta9-THC and each of the radiolabelled stimulants was determined in plasma and brain. Only minor interactive effects were found and, in general, they could not account for the functional interactions.
Effects of 35-day exposures to subanesthetic concentrations of halothane, isoflurane, and diethyl ether were measured in mice, rats, and guinea pigs which were in a phase of rapid body growth. Halothane produced a greater decrement in weight gain and a greater incidence of hepatic degenerative changes than isoflurane or diethyl ether despite its administration at lower anesthetic concentrations. Isoflurane results were intermediate between those of halothane and diethyl ether. No consistent injury to any organ other than the liver was found.
The clinical efficacy of high dose (160 mg) polyoestradiol phosphate (PEP) was compared with that of orchiectomy in a prospective randomised multicentre study including 200 prostatic cancer patients. The effect of daily low dose (75 mg) acetosalicylic acid (ASA) on possible cardiovascular complications during the first 6 months of therapy was also evaluated. Oestrogen-treated patients had more progressions, but follow-up was too short to draw any definite conclusions on the efficacy of treatment. There was no cardiovascular mortality and there were no thromboembolic complications in any treatment group. It was concluded that parenteral high dose PEP is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and there is no need for daily low dose ASA.
This study was designed to examine the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSP) against myocardial injury (MI) induced by isoproterenol (ISO), in a rat model. Induction of rats with ISO (85 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) for 2 days resulted in a significant decrease in the activities of heart mitochondrial enzymes (isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) and respiratory chain enzymes (NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase). The activities of lysosomal enzymes (alpha-d-glucuronidase, alpha-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase, cathepsin-D, acid phosphatases and alpha-d-galactosidase) were increased significantly in the heart and serum of ISO-induced rats. The prior administration of GSP for 6 days a week for 5 weeks significantly increased the activities of mitochondrial and respiratory chain enzymes and significantly decreased the activities of lysosomal enzymes in the heart tissues of ISO-induced rats, which proves the stress stabilizing action of GSP. Oral administration of grape seed proanthocyanidins alone (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg) to normal rats did not show any significant effect in all the parameters studied. These biochemical functional alterations were supported by the macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of ischemic myocardium. Thus, this study shows that 100 and 150 mg/kg of GSP gives protection against ISO-induced MI and demonstrates that GSP has a significant effect in the protection of heart.
Upregulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with their resistance to functional inactivation (anergy) and to activation-induced cell death through apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, can enhance apoptosis of human lupus T cells. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether COX-2 expression is also upregulated in T cells from the lupus-prone BXBS strain of mice and if murine lupus is modified by celecoxib. COX-2 expression was detected in splenic T cells from 6 month-old male BXSB mice (murine lupus T cells) but not in T cells from 2 month-old male or 6-month-old female BXSB or in 6-month-old male C57BL/6 mice, indicating a strong correlation between COX-2 expression in T cells and lupus manifestation in mice. Celecoxib treatment induced apoptosis of murine lupus T cells in vitro, which was inhibited by z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor. In the murine lupus T cells treated with celecoxib, procaspases 3 and 9, but not procaspase 8, were activated. In addition, celecoxib treatment decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential of murine lupus T cells. These data combine to suggest that celecoxib mainly uses the mitochondrial pathway rather than FADD pathway to trigger apoptosis of COX-2 expressing murine lupus T cells. Intragastric administration of celecoxib (40 mg/kg/day for 60 days) in 6-month-old male BXSB mice effectively limited the production of serum antibodies against dsDNA. Our data suggest that celecoxib may have a beneficial effect in treating autoimmune diseases such as SLE through inducing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells.
Thousands of somatic mutations accrue in most human cancers, and their causes are largely unknown. We recently showed that the DNA cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B accounts for up to half of the mutational load in breast carcinomas expressing this enzyme. Here we address whether APOBEC3B is broadly responsible for mutagenesis in multiple tumor types. We analyzed gene expression data and mutation patterns, distributions and loads for 19 different cancer types, with over 4,800 exomes and 1,000,000 somatic mutations. Notably, APOBEC3B is upregulated, and its preferred target sequence is frequently mutated and clustered in at least six distinct cancers: bladder, cervix, lung (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), head and neck, and breast. Interpreting these findings in the light of previous genetic, cellular and biochemical studies, the most parsimonious conclusion from these global analyses is that APOBEC3B-catalyzed genomic uracil lesions are responsible for a large proportion of both dispersed and clustered mutations in multiple distinct cancers.
PAX5 is a transcription factor required for B-cell development and maintenance. PML is a tumor suppressor and a pro-apoptotic factor. A fusion gene, PAX5-PML, was found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with chromosomal translocation t(9;15)(p13;q24), but no functional analysis has been reported. Here, we demonstrate that PAX5-PML had a dominant-negative effect on both PAX5 and PML. PAX5-PML dominant negatively inhibited PAX5 transcriptional activity in the luciferase reporter assay and suppressed the expression of the PAX5 transcriptional targets in B-lymphoid cell line. Surprisingly, PAX5-PML hardly showed DNA-binding activity in vitro although it retained the DNA-binding domain of PAX5. Additional experiments, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, suggested that PAX5-PML bound to the promoter through the association with PAX5 on the promoter. On the other hand, coexpression of PAX5-PML inhibited PML sumoylation, disrupted PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and conferred apoptosis resistance on HeLa cells. Furthermore, treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) induced PML sumoylation and reconstitution of PML NBs, and overcame the anti-apoptotic effect of PAX5-PML in HeLa cells. These data suggest the possible involvement of this fusion protein in the leukemogenesis of B-ALL in a dual dominant-negative manner and the possibility that ALL with PAX5-PML can be treated with ATO.
Fumonisin mycotoxins occur worldwide in corn and corn-based foods. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a rodent liver carcinogen and suspected human carcinogen. It inhibits ceramide synthase and increases tissue sphinganine (Sa) and sphingosine (So) concentrations. Events linking disruption of sphingolipid metabolism and fumonisin toxicity are not fully understood; however, Sa and So were shown to bind mouse recombinant peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) in vitro. To investigate the role of PPARalpha in fumonisin hepatotoxicity in vivo, wild-type (WT) and PPARalpha-null mice were fed control diets or diets containing 300 ppm FB1, Fusarium verticillioides culture material (CM) providing 300 ppm FB1, or 500 ppm of the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 (WY) for 1 week. WY-fed WT mice exhibited hepatomegaly, an effect not found in WY-fed PPARalpha-null mice, and WY did not change liver sphingoid base concentrations in either strain. Hepatotoxicity found in FB1- and CM-fed WT and PPARalpha-null mice was similar, qualitatively different from that found in WY-treated animals, and characterized by increased Sa concentration, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. Transcript profiling using oligonucleotide arrays showed that CM and FB1 elicited similar expression patterns of genes involved in cell proliferation, signal transduction, and glutathione metabolism that were different from that altered by WY. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of gene expression demonstrated PPARalpha-dependence of lipid metabolism gene expression in WY-treated mice, whereas PPARalpha-independent alterations of genes in lipid metabolism, and other categories, were found in CM- and FB1-fed mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that FB1- and CM-induced hepatotoxicity in mice does not require PPARalpha.
Administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of 1,1-dichloroethylene (125 mg/kg, 1,1-DCE) to mice resulted in bronchiolar injury with selective necrosis of Clara cells. Degenerative changes were manifest in Clara cells as early as 1 h following 1,1-DCE exposure, and were characterized by marked swelling of mitochondria and aggregation of chromatin against the nuclear membrane. Cell death was apparent at 2 h; by 8 h, areas of the bronchiolar epithelium were devoid of lining cells, and at 24 h, the majority of Clara cells were exfoliated. The residual epithelium consisted of flattened cells which formed a thin lining for the airway. Necrosis of Clara cells early in the course of 1,1-DCE exposure coincided with peak covalent binding of [14C]1,1-DCE and significant depression of components of the pulmonary mixed-function oxidase system; cytochrome P-450 and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity were markedly reduced but not depleted. Liver damage involving centrilobular hepatocytes was observed at 24 h in 30% of treated animals, and coincided with significant inhibition of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity; cytochrome P-450 content, however, remained unchanged. While changes in the liver evoked by 1,1-DCE were less striking, the results in lung demonstrate positive temporal correlations between structural damage, peak covalent binding and disturbances of monooxygenase enzymes.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem complex autoimmune disease of uncertain etiology (OMIM 152700). Over recent years a genetic component to SLE susceptibility has been established. Recent successes with association studies in SLE have identified genes including IRF5 (refs. 4,5) and FCGR3B. Two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members located within intervals showing genetic linkage with SLE are TNFSF4 (also known as OX40L; 1q25), which is expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and vascular endothelial cells, and also its unique receptor, TNFRSF4 (also known as OX40; 1p36), which is primarily expressed on activated CD4+ T cells. TNFSF4 produces a potent co-stimulatory signal for activated CD4+ T cells after engagement of TNFRSF4 (ref. 11). Using both a family-based and a case-control study design, we show that the upstream region of TNFSF4 contains a single risk haplotype for SLE, which is correlated with increased expression of both cell-surface TNFSF4 and the TNFSF4 transcript. We hypothesize that increased expression of TNFSF4 predisposes to SLE either by quantitatively augmenting T cell-APC interaction or by influencing the functional consequences of T cell activation via TNFRSF4.
Chronic pancreatitis is a persistent inflammatory disease of the pancreas, in which the digestive protease trypsin has a fundamental pathogenetic role. Here we have analyzed the gene encoding the trypsin-degrading enzyme chymotrypsin C (CTRC) in German subjects with idiopathic or hereditary chronic pancreatitis. Two alterations in this gene, p.R254W and p.K247_R254del, were significantly overrepresented in the pancreatitis group, being present in 30 of 901 (3.3%) affected individuals but only 21 of 2,804 (0.7%) controls (odds ratio (OR) = 4.6; confidence interval (CI) = 2.6-8.0; P = 1.3 x 10(-7)). A replication study identified these two variants in 10 of 348 (2.9%) individuals with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis but only 3 of 432 (0.7%) subjects with alcoholic liver disease (OR = 4.2; CI = 1.2-15.5; P = 0.02). CTRC variants were also found in 10 of 71 (14.1%) Indian subjects with tropical pancreatitis but only 1 of 84 (1.2%) healthy controls (OR = 13.6; CI = 1.7-109.2; P = 0.0028). Functional analysis of the CTRC variants showed impaired activity and/or reduced secretion. The results indicate that loss-of-function alterations in CTRC predispose to pancreatitis by diminishing its protective trypsin-degrading activity.
The therapeutic efficacy of calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (CaNa(2)EDTA) and the two thiol chelators, 2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate (DMPS) and monoisoamyl dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA) was studied, both individually and in combination, in reducing lead concentration in blood and soft tissues and in restoring lead induced altered biochemical variables in rats. Exposure to subacute dose of lead implicated a critical role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in altering the normal values of these variables. Exposure to lead caused a significant inhibition of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), an important enzyme in the haem synthesis pathway and glutathione (GSH) level. These changes were also accompanied by inhibition of ALAD activity in kidney, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) activities in liver and changes in platelet counts in whole blood suggesting disturbed haem synthesis pathway. Lead exposure also led to a pronounced depletion of brain GSH contents, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST). Specific activities of membrane-bound enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO), were significantly inhibited on lead exposure. These biochemical changes were correlated with increased uptake of lead in blood and soft tissues. Post lead exposure treatment with MiADMSA in particular provided significant recovery in altered biochemical variables besides significant depletion of tissue lead burden. Treatment with CaNa(2)EDTA and DMPS individually had only moderate beneficial effects on tissue oxidative stress, although they were equally effective in the removal of tissue lead burden. Tissue zinc and copper levels did not depict any significant depletion, although changes like marked depletion of zinc following CaNa(2)EDTA and copper after MiADMSA administration were of some concern. Combined administration of CaNa(2)EDTA, particularly with MiADMSA, was the most effective treatment protocol compared to all other treatments. It can be concluded from our present results that combined therapy with CaNa(2)EDTA and MiADMSA proved significantly better in restoring biochemical and clinical variables over monotherapy with these chelating agents against subacute lead exposure in adult rats.
The efficacy and tolerability of losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg and enalapril 10 mg/HCTZ 25 mg were compared in a double-blind, randomized trial in hypertensive patients inadequately controlled and experiencing side effects on prior therapy. Patients with moderate or severe hypertension, currently treated with at least two single-agent drugs (excluding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above 90 mm Hg, and at least one undesirable drug-related symptom were randomized to once-daily treatment with one of the combinations for 12 weeks. Losartan/HCTZ lowered sitting DBP from the prior therapy baseline by 13.7 mm Hg and sitting systolic blood pressure 19.3 mm Hg; similar reductions occurred with enalapril/HCTZ. Trough sitting DBP was reduced to normal levels (< 90 mm Hg) in 63% of patients switched to the losartan combination and in 58% of those treated with the enalapril combination. Each combination was associated with improved tolerability compared with prior therapy, although fewer patients reported each of 24 undesirable symptoms after 12 weeks of losartan/HCTZ. The improvement from prior therapy in the occurrence of cough was significantly greater with losartan/HCTZ (P = .005). Enalapril/HCTZ, but not losartan/HCTZ, increased serum uric acid levels at week 12. In conclusion, the combination of losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg offers a beneficial therapeutic option for patients with a history of moderate to severe hypertension whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled or who exhibit side effects while on two or more single-agent antihypertensive drugs. In this population, the switch from prior antihypertensive therapies to once daily losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg improves blood pressure control and reduces side effects.
In addition to natural retinoids, new synthetic retinoids, such as adapalene and tazarotene, are currently available for the treatment of acne. In this study, we evaluated the comedolytic effect of a novel retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-gamma specific retinoid, ER36009, in the rhino mouse. The animals were treated for five days a week with ER36009 (0.00001, 0.000025, 0.00010, 0.00025%), all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) (0.001, 0.005, 0.010, 0.050%), two commercial formulations (Differine((R)) 0.1% adapalene gel, and Tazorac 0.1% tazarotene gel) and acetone as a control, for two weeks. After the treatments, utricle diameter and apoptosis of the follicular epidermis were examined. ER36009 was 96 times more potent than RA in the utricle diameter reduction assay. It also eliminated apoptosis of the follicular epidermis and restored normal apoptosis at the granular layer. These data indicate that ER36009 is a potent comedolytic agent compared with other currently available retinoids.
