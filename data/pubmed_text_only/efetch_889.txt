The use of isotretinoin as a treatment for acne is related to psychiatric syndromes such as psychosis and depression. On the other hand, several drugs have been identified as causing panic attacks. A relationship between dermatologic and psychiatric disease has also been established. We report a 20 year-old male who started to suffer panic attacks after using isotretinoin for acne.
In thyreostatic treatment the loss of taste combined with discreetly increasing hepatic enzymes has been observed as a toxic effect of thiamazole in a female patient. Sense and hepatic enzymes normalized rapidly after discontinuing use of thiamazole.
The number of people dependent on crack-cocaine in the UK has increased substantially in recent years. Some crack-cocaine users develop coarsening changes in the appearance of their hands after prolonged use of the drug. These changes have most often been recognized in females and include: (i) Perniosis with cold, numb hands, sometimes with perniotic hyperkeratosis over the knuckles.(ii) Finger pulp atrophy of the distal part of the pulps of some digits, especially the thumbs and index fingers.(iii) Claw-like curvature of the nails. As the distal pulp is lost, it can no longer splint the nail straight and so the nail curves, claw-like, and reminiscent of a parrot's beak as it clings to the new contour. As the pulp atrophy progresses, the nail eventually also becomes smaller.This triad may be due to ischemia consequent upon peripheral vasoconstriction induced by crack-cocaine. Early changes may resolve with abstinence. In the patients described the syndrome does not appear to be to related to intravenous drug usage. It may occur without concomitant use of heroin, whether smoked or via the intravenous route. The syndrome does not occur in all crack-cocaine users. It is hypothesized that those with a vasoreactive circulation (i.e., those with vasomotor instability/perniosis) are more susceptible to this reaction pattern. The syndrome consisting of the triad of perniosis, pulp atrophy and parrot-beaked clawing of the nails should alert the clinician to the possibility of prolonged crack-cocaine misuse.
The favorable metabolic effects of telmisartan have been related to its blockade of angiotensin (Ang) II receptor and action as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). We designed a comparative study of telmisartan and losartan in ApoE-deficient mice. ApoE-deficient mice were fed a high-fat diet with or without telmisartan (10 mg/kg/day) or losartan (30 mg/kg/day) for 3 months. Treatment with telmisartan or losartan significantly reduced blood pressure, but did not affect serum cholesterol, triglyceride or glucose levels. Both drugs inhibited the development of lipid-rich plaque as assessed by oil red O staining. However, treatment with telmisartan, but not losartan, significantly improved endothelial dysfunction as assessed by the vasodilator response to acetylcholine. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the differential response in the improvement of endothelial dysfunction between telmisartan and losartan, we next focused on the expression of various cytokines. As both telmisartan and losartan attenuated interleukin-6 mRNA expression in the aorta, there was a significant change in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA in the aorta. Notably, telmisartan, but not losartan, significantly increased the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), but not that of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the aorta. Although a decrease in body weight and adipose tissue weight was observed with both telmisartan and losartan, liver weight was significantly decreased in only the telmisartan-treated group. Of importance, telmisartan markedly inhibited lipid accumulation in the liver. Overall, telmisartan and losartan induced differential responses in the improvement of endothelial dysfunction, probably due to their effects on vascular HGF levels and fatty liver. These favorable characteristics of telmisartan might be due to its action as a partial agonist of PPARγ, beyond its blood pressure-lowering effect, through Ang II blockade.
An 11-year-old boy presented to the pediatric ED with signs and symptoms of Bell's palsy, which was believed to be a result of otitis media. He subsequently began to list to the left and could not walk erect. Because of a history of prochlorperazine use for vomiting, a diagnosis of a dystonic reaction to a phenothiazine was made, and the patient was treated with intravenous diphenhydramine. All symptoms resolved, including seventh nerve palsy, within 5 minutes of treatment. Medications are often prescribed by physicians for vomiting without caretakers being aware of the side-effects. Dystonic reactions can be severe and present with myriad neurologic signs and symptoms.
Factor H (FH) is the major regulatory protein of the complement alternative pathway, with a structure consisting of a tandem array of 20 homologous units, called short consensus repeats (SCR). Reported are 16 FH-deficient patients. Among six patients with homozygous deficiency, four presented with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and two with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The ten other patients had heterozygous FH deficiency and developed atypical HUS. HUS onset occurred from birth to midadulthood, and disease progression was variable. Four children with homozygous or heterozygous FH deficiency and HUS underwent renal transplantation, which was successful in three but failed as a result of recurrence of HUS in one patient. All but one patient exhibited alternative pathway-mediated complement consumption, with no detectable FH antigenic levels or with 50% immunochemical or functional FH levels in the case of complete or partial deficiency, respectively. The molecular mechanisms of the deficiency were documented in all cases by exon-specific sequencing analysis. These mechanisms included nucleotide substitutions, insertion, or deletion located in SCR 2, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 20, leading to an amino acid substitution or to a stop codon. This report emphasizes the variability in the clinical progression of kidney diseases associated with FH deficiencies. Genetic analysis reveals the molecular abnormalities associated with FH deficiencies to be polymorphous.
It has previously been demonstrated that gingival fibroblasts derived from nifedipine-reactive patients (nifedipine responders) show a greater cell proliferation rate than those from nifedipine non-reactive patients (nifedipine non-responders) in the presence of 1 microM nifedipine. The aim of the present study was to characterize cell cycle differences between nifedipine responder and non-responder fibroblast cells and determine the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on cell cycle progression. Further, the effect of bFGF on cyclins A, B1, D1, E, and CDKs 1, 2, 4, 6 mRNA expression in responder and non-responder cells was investigated. A population of nifedipine responder cells underwent progression to S and G2/M phases from G0/G1 phase in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum or 10 ng/ml bFGF was greater than nifedipine non-responder cells. mRNA expression of cyclins A, B1, D1, E and CDKs 1, 2, 4, 6 in the presence of 10 ng/ml bFGF was generally greater in nifedipine responder cells than non-responder cells. These results indicate that nifedipine responder cells may be more susceptible to growth factors such as bFGF with a resultant increase in expression of cyclins and CDKs in responder compared with non-responder cells.
Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective and potent alpha2-adrenergic agonist, has a potentially useful role as a sedative agent in patients requiring intensive care. As part of a larger European multicentre trial, a total of 119 postoperative cardiac and general surgical patients requiring ventilation and sedation in an intensive care unit were enrolled in four centres in the United Kingdom. One hundred and five patients were randomly allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine or placebo with rescue sedation and analgesia provided by midazolam and morphine, respectively. Compared with the control group, intubated patients receiving dexmedetomidine required 80% less midazolam [mean 4.9 (5.8) microg.kg-1.h-1 vs. 23.7 (27.5) microg.kg-1.h-1, p < 0.0001], and 50% less morphine [11.2 (13.4) microg.kg-1.h-1 vs. 21.5 (19.4) microg.kg-1.h-1,p = 0.0006]. Cardiovascular effects and adverse events could be predicted from the known properties of alpha-2 agonists. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine is a useful agent for the provision of postoperative analgesia and sedation.
Although tinnitus is listed among the rare neurologic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants, little is known about its prevalence, mechanism of development, course, and management. A chart review of 475 patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants indicated that tinnitus occurred in about 1% of the patients. The case vignettes of 5 patients who developed tinnitus in the course of imipramine therapy are presented. Each developed tinnitus in the second or third week of treatment with imipramine at daily dosages of 150-250 mg and at combined plasma imipramine-desipramine levels between 200-450 ng/ml. In each patient, tinnitus subsided spontaneously within 2-4 weeks of onset without any specific treatment, even though the daily dosage of imipramine and the plasma tricyclic levels were constant or increased. Possible mechanisms of development of tinnitus and implications for tricyclic antidepressant therapy are discussed.
Association of childhood respiratory illness with traffic air pollution has been investigated largely in developed but not in developing countries, where pollution levels are often very high.
In this study we investigated associations between respiratory health and outdoor and indoor air pollution in schoolchildren 7-14 years of age in low socioeconomic status areas in the Niger Delta.
A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 1,397 schoolchildren. Exposure to home outdoor and indoor air pollution was assessed by self-report questionnaire. School air pollution exposures were assessed using traffic counts, distance of schools to major streets, and particulate matter and carbon monoxide measurements, combined using principal components analysis. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to examine associations with reported respiratory health, adjusting for potential confounders.
Traffic disturbance at home (i.e., traffic noise and/or fumes evident inside the home vs. none) was associated with wheeze [odds ratio (OR) = 2.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-3.64], night cough (OR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.03-1.82), phlegm (OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.09-2.04), and nose symptoms (OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.90), whereas school exposure to a component variable indicating exposure to fine particles was associated with increased phlegm (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75). Nonsignificant positive associations were found between cooking with wood/coal (OR = 2.99; 95% CI, 0.88-10.18) or kerosene (OR = 2.83; 95% CI, 0.85-9.44) and phlegm compared with cooking with gas.
Traffic pollution is associated with respiratory symptoms in schoolchildren in a deprived area of western Africa. Associations may have been underestimated because of nondifferential misclassification resulting from limitations in exposure measurement.
A patient developed manic symptoms during treatment with alprazolam. These symptoms remitted upon discontinuation of treatment, but reemerged during a second trial with alprazolam. Subsequent administration of an equivalent dosage of lorazepam did not induce manic symptoms. The clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms of action of alprazolam, a novel benzodiazepine.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is used as a monomer during the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. However, BPA adversely affects reproductive organ growth and development, and it has been proposed that the detrimental effects of BPA could extend to future generations. The present study was conducted to evaluate the transgenerational effects of BPA on hippocampal neurogenesis and neurocognitive function. Pregnant female C57BL/6 mice (F0) were exposed to BPA (0.1-10 mg/kg) from gestation day 6 to 17, and female offspring (F2) from F1 generation mice were prepared. It was found that exposure of F0 mice to BPA at 10 mg/kg decreased the number of newly generated cells in the hippocampi of F2 female mice. Passive avoidance testing revealed that high-doses BPA (1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) decreased cross-over latency time in F2 mice, suggesting a BPA-mediated neurocognitive deficit in terms of memory retention. Furthermore, it was found that levels of phospho-ERK, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phospho-CREB in hippocampi were significantly lower in F2 mice. Interestingly, the effects of BPA on hippocampal neurogenesis were found to be correlated with altered DNA methylation. In particular, high-dose BPA exposure increased DNA methylation of the CREB regulated transcription coactivator 1 (Crtc1) generated in F2 mice. These findings suggest that BPA exposure of pregnant mothers could adversely affect hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function in future generations by modulating the ERK and BDNF-CREB signaling cascades.
Chronic hepatitis B affects 5-10% of HIV patients in Western countries. Lamivudine should no longer be used as a single anti-HBV agent in HIV-HBV co-infected patients, given its limited antiviral potency and high risk of selection of resistance, which further results in wide cross-resistance to all other nucleoside analogues. Recent reports of transmission of lamivudine-resistant HBV in HIV patients are of especial concern, and large surveillance studies suggest that it may occur in up to 10% of new HBV infections in Western countries. Another worrisome aspect of the selection of lamivudine-resistant HBV is the potential for selection of vaccine escape mutants. Currently, tenofovir must be viewed as the drug of choice in HIV-HBV co-infected patients in whom antiretroviral therapy is advised. Its co-formulation with emtricitabine (Truvada) is particularly convenient for treating both HIV and HBV in co-infected individuals. While pegIFN-alpha monotherapy for 1 year may be considered for HIV-HBV coinfected individuals with good spontaneous HIV control (elevated CD4 cell count, low plasma HIV-RNA), and certain HBV features (genotype A, HBeAg+, low serum HBV-DNA and elevated ALT), it is clear that very few coinfected patients fulfill these criteria. In HBeAg-negative HIV patients, adefovir may be an option but the relatively low antiviral potency of this drug discourages its wide use. Given its potential anti-HIV activity, both entecavir and telbivudine must only be prescribed with antiretroviral agents. Lack of information about potential pharmacodynamic interactions between entecavir and abacavir (both are guanosine analogues) or between telbivudine and zidovudine or stavudine (all are thymidine analogues) further discourages their concomitant use. At this time, most experts agree that early introduction of anti-HBV active HAART is the best strategy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HIV patients, and Truvada must be part of the triple regimen.
Nickel, chromium, and cobalt are important skin sensitizers. Better knowledge about skin exposure is needed for more efficient prevention. We have previously developed acid wipe sampling for assessment of skin exposure to metals.
To apply the acid wipe sampling technique in some occupations where intense contact with metallic items occurs and to gather experience for the design of future workplace studies.
18 volunteers (carpenters, locksmiths, cashiers, and secretaries as controls) participated. They performed their normal tasks during a job session for exposure. Samples were taken from fingers and palms by acid wipe sampling, and analysis of metals was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.
The metals were detected in all samples, and the amount of nickel was larger than that of chromium and cobalt. Fingers were more exposed than palms. 8-h exposure to nickel was calculated and was highest in locksmiths (mean 3.784 mug/cm(2), range 1.846-5.028 mug/cm(2)) followed by carpenters, cashiers, and secretaries.
The acid wipe sampling technique is suitable for studies of skin exposure to nickel, chromium, and cobalt in the workplace. The sampling efficiency of acid wipe sampling is high. The amounts of nickel deposited on skin in carpenters, locksmiths, and cashiers are judged capable of eliciting allergic contact dermatitis.
Objective tumor responses and survival rates with standard chemotherapy options for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been disappointing. However, several promising new classes of agents have emerged in recent years, including the taxanes, mitotic spindle inhibitors, antimetabolites, and topoisomerase I and II inhibitors. The molecular target of several of these new agents is topoisomerase I, an enzyme that is essential for DNA replication and is up-regulated in tumor cells. Inhibition of this enzyme by drugs such as topotecan and irinotecan leads to cell death and is the basis for their anticancer activity. The process of DNA replication is halted by the covalent binding of the drug in a topoisomerase I drug/DNA ternary reaction intermediate. The pharmacokinetics of the approved regimen--a 30-min infusion daily for 5 days at 21-day intervals--are well defined, with proportional increases in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, peak plasma concentration, and steady state concentration following application of higher doses. The antitumor activities of both the intravenous and oral formulations of topotecan have been tested in clinical trials. Topotecan is well tolerated and has demonstrated good efficacy in patients with relapsed SCLC when administered as monotherapy or in combination regimens as first-line or second-line therapy. Preliminary trials also indicate that topotecan is well tolerated and has activity in the first-line treatment of NSCLC. In this article an overview of new agents in lung cancer chemotherapy is provided, with particular attention paid to the topoisomerase I inhibitors. A review of topotecan--the first topoisomerase I inhibitor to be approved for second-line therapy in SCLC--is presented as an illustration of the promise these new agents hold for the treatment of SCLC and NSCLC.
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial to determine whether lansoprazole was superior to continued therapy with histamine H2-receptor antagonist therapy in healing erosive reflux esophagitis.
Investigators from nine medical centers enrolled 159 patients with endoscopically documented esophageal erosions and/or ulcers that had failed to heal with 12 or more wk of at least standard dosages of histamine H2-receptor antagonist therapy. Patients received ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for 8 wk or lansoprazole 30 mg for 4 wk followed by either lansoprazole 30 mg or lansoprazole 60 mg for another 4 wk of treatment. Patients underwent endoscopy at screening and at weeks 2, 4, and 8.
At 2, 4, and 8 wk of therapy, healing rates were significantly higher in the lansoprazole group compared with the ranitidine group (p < 0.001). By 8 wk, 84% of the lansoprazole group were healed as opposed to only 32% of the ranitidine group. Lansoprazole was superior to ranitidine in providing relief of upper abdominal burning and daytime heartburn (p < 0.001) and reducing the need for antacids (p < 0.001). Lansoprazole patients had less interference with sleep and less day time drowsiness than ranitidine patients (p = 0.05). The percentages of patients with adverse events were similar in both groups. Fasting serum gastrin levels at weeks 4 and 8 were significantly higher in the lansoprazole group compared with the ranitidine group.
Eight weeks of lansoprazole therapy is safe, superior to continued ranitidine therapy, and effective in healing more than 80% of patients with erosive reflux esophagitis previously resistant to histamine H2-receptor antagonist therapy.
In some patients, graft-induced dyskinesia develops following intrastriatal transplantation of embryonic neural tissue for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The mechanisms underlying these involuntary movements need to be clarified before this approach to clinical cell therapy can be developed further. We previously found that rats with 6-OHDA lesions, primed with L-DOPA treatment and that have subsequently undergone intrastriatal graft surgery exhibit involuntary movements when subjected to amphetamine. This model of amphetamine-induced AIMs reflects a pattern of post-graft behaviours that in the absence of robust spontaneous GID in the rat is the closest approximation that we currently have available. We now show that they are associated with the chronic administration of L-DOPA prior to the transplantation surgery. We also demonstrate that neither changes in c-fos nor FosB/DeltaFosB expression in the lateral striatum are associated with the expression of these behaviours. Taken together, these data reveal that the severity of abnormal movements elicited by amphetamine in grafted animals may relate to previous L-DOPA exposure and dyskinesia development, but they develop through mechanisms that are independent of FosB/DeltaFosB upregulation.
In melanoma, several signaling pathways are constitutively activated. Among these, the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways are activated through multiple signal transduction molecules and appear to play major roles in melanoma progression. Recently, it has been reported that tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen reagent, inhibits PKC signaling in estrogen-negative and estrogen-independent cancer cell lines. Thus, we investigated whether tamoxifen inhibited tumor cell invasion and metastasis in mouse melanoma cell line B16BL6. Tamoxifen significantly inhibited lung metastasis, cell migration, and invasion at concentrations that did not show anti-proliferative effects on B16BL6 cells. Tamoxifen also inhibited the mRNA expressions and protein activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, tamoxifen suppressed phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt through the inhibition of PKCalpha and PKCdelta phosphorylation. However, other signal transduction factor, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) was unaffected. The results indicate that tamoxifen suppresses the PKC/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK and PKC/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, thereby inhibiting B16BL6 cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Moreover, tamoxifen markedly inhibited not only developing but also clinically evident metastasis. These findings suggest that tamoxifen has potential clinical applications for the treatment of tumor cell metastasis.
Bromo-Dragonfly (BDF) is a designer drug chemically related to LSD and amphetamine. The first registration in Denmark was in October 2007. In the present case an 18-year-old man ingested about 2 ml BDF and developed acute psychosis. At the hospital the patient displayed, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnea and hypertension. Because of severe hallucinations and agitation the patient was detained at the hospital and received symptomatic treatment with large doses of benzodiazepines. Four days after hospitalization, the patient discharged himself without significant symptoms or paraclinical findings.
Illicit opioid overdoses are a significant problem throughout the world, with most deaths being attributed to opioid-induced respiratory depression which may involve peripheral mechanisms. The current treatment for overdoses is naloxone hydrochloride, which is effective but induces significant withdrawal. We propose that selectively peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonists, such as naloxone methiodide, could reverse respiratory depression without inducing predominantly centrally mediated withdrawal. Acute administration of morphine (300 mg/kg, i.p.) was found to significantly depress respiratory rate and induce analgesia (P<0.0001). Both naloxone hydrochloride and naloxone methiodide were able to reverse these effects but naloxone methiodide precipitated no significant withdrawal. Naloxone methiodide was also able to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression (P<0.001) and antinociception (P<0.01) after chronic morphine administration (300 mg/kg/day for 5 days) without inducing significant withdrawal. Therefore, peripherally selective opioid receptor antagonists should be investigated as possible treatments for opioid-induced respiratory depression which do not induce adverse effects, such as withdrawal.
Therapeutic agents that block the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway might be beneficial for incurable inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis. Here, we investigated the effect of the novel NF-κB inhibitor celastrol on murine colitis. Colitis was induced in male mice by administration of 5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for a period of 5 days, followed by a 2 day recovery period. Celastrol (2mg/kg, oral) was administered daily over the 1 week of the study. Our results indicated that treatment with celastrol attenuated DSS-induced colon shortening and neutrophil infiltration. Besides, celastrol ameliorated DSS-induced colon injury and inflammatory signs as visualized by histopathology. The mechanisms behind these beneficial effects of celastrol were also elucidated. These include (i) counteracting DSS-induced oxidative stress in the colon via decreasing lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal) and increasing the antioxidant levels (reduced glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase and superoxide dismutase); (ii) inhibiting DSS-induced activation of the NLRP3-inflammasome, as evidenced by decreased production of IL-1β and IFN-γ as indirect measure of IL-18 in the colon; (iii) targeting DSS-induced activation of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway by abating the elevation of IL-23 and IL-17A levels in the colon; (iv) augmenting the anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms via increasing IL-10 and TNF-α levels in the colon; (v) and more importantly, maintaining intestinal epithelial reconstitution and homeostasis via attenuating the overexpression of CD98 in colonic epithelial cells. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into the beneficial effects of celastrol as a promising candidate for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in humans.
An oxidant stress has been shown to prevail in experimental and clinical nephrotic syndrome. Such oxidant stress may be induced by a reduced activity of antioxidant systems. We examined the altered expression of manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), an antioxidant enzyme, in patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, in whom an increased oxidant stress had been demonstrated. The Mn-SOD activities in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 12 patients with active nephrotic syndrome (6.0 +/- 1.1 years of age, mean +/- SE) and hypoproteinemia were 42% lower (p < 0.05) than in 12 control subjects (5.5 +/- 0.5 years of age) with normal serum total protein concentrations. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction also demonstrated that Mn-SOD messenger RNA expression in the patients with nephrotic syndrome was, on average, 59% lower than in control subjects. Because expressions of some genes are sensitive to serum, the serum dependency of Mn-SOD gene transcription was studied in glomerular endothelial cells transfected with a luciferase reporter gene fused with a rat Mn-SOD DNA fragment of -806 to +22 bp of the transcription initiation site (-806:+22). When these cells were exposed to different concentrations of fetal bovine serum (0.5% to 15%), the transcriptional activities determined by luciferase activities were proportional to serum concentrations. This serum-dependent transcriptional activation was also demonstrated by the fragment (-220:+22) but not by the fragment (-220:-20). When glomerular endothelial cells transfected with the fragment (-220:+22) were treated with 5% serum from patients with active nephrotic syndrome, transcriptional activation was more than 80% less than that by 5% serum from control subjects without nephrosis. These results indicate that Mn-SOD gene transcription is regulated at least in part by serum, and that the serum-dependent transcription of the gene is diminished in patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. The regulatory region of serum-dependent gene transcription resides within its early promoter region. Our findings suggest that down-regulation of antioxidant enzyme transcription may contribute increased oxidant stress in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.
In the present study, the effects of endogenous histamine in the ventral hippocampus on fear memory deficits induced by scopolamine were investigated as evaluated by step-through avoidance response in adult male rats. Bilateral ventral hippocampal injection of scopolamine (i.h., 2, 5 microg/site) significantly produced depressant effects on the active avoidance response in a dose-dependent manner. Histamine H(3)-antagonist clobenpropit (5, 10 microg/site) significantly ameliorated the fear memory deficits induced by scopolamine in a dose-dependent manner. Its procognitive effect was completely antagonized by immepip (10 microg/site), a selective histamine H(3)-agonist. Both histamine H(1)-antagonist pyrilamine and H(2)-antagonist cimetidine, also inhibited the procognitive effects of clobenpropit. Additionally, the procognitive effects of clobenpropit on the fear memory deficits induced by scopolamine were significantly potentiated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of histidine, a precursor of histamine, but markedly reversed by i.h. injection of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH, 10 microg/site), a selective and potent histidine decarboxylase inhibitor. It is concluded that the increased endogenous histamine release in the ventral hippocampus ameliorates the scopolamine-induced fear memory deficits, and its action is mainly mediated by histamine presynaptic H(3)-receptors and postsynaptic H(1)- and H(2)-receptors.
In order to aid the interpretation of hair results from methamphetamine (MA) abusers the MA and amphetamine (AP) concentrations in 2070 hair samples were statistically evaluated. The MA and AP concentrations in hair were put into three groups arbitrarily representing low, medium and high ranges and the metabolite-to-parent drug ratios of each group were examined. The concentration ranges proposed here were also applied to the interpretation of five authentic cases. The low, medium and high ranges of MA were 0.5-4.2, 4.2-24.5 and 24.5-608.9 ng/mg and those of AP were 0.1-0.4, 0.4-1.7 and 1.7-41.4 ng/mg. The AP-to-MA ratios showed large variation but a tendency that it decreased as the MA ranges increased. This evaluation was very useful to presume the severity of individuals' MA abuse and to provide law enforcement agencies more understandable information. It could also facilitate the court's decision regarding specific circumstances surrounding the drug-related crimes.
