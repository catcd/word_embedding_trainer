Generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This study examined pro-apoptotic mitochondrial cell death signals in an H9C2 myocyte rat cell line and in isolated rat heart mitochondria exposed to doxorubicin. Mitochondrial and cellular viability were assessed using an MTT viability assay (formazan product formed by functional mitochondrial dehydrogenases) and calcein AM dye (fluoresces upon cleavage by cytosolic esterases). Mitochondrial dysfunction followed by cell death was observed using nM concentrations of doxorubicin. Significant doxorubicin-induced cell death was not apparent until after 6 h following doxorubicin exposure using the calcein AM assay. The involvement of apoptosis is evidenced by an increase in TUNEL (terminal (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling)-positive nuclei following doxorubicin treatment. Furthermore, doxorubicin administered to isolated mitochondria induced a rapid increase in superoxide production, which persisted for at least 1 h and was followed by increased cytochrome c efflux. In addition, caspase-3 activity was increased with doxorubicin administration in the H9C2 myocyte cell line. An oxidant-mediated threshold of mitochondrial death may be required for doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.
This study examined the results of two previous studies that evaluated African Americans and whites who were undergoing treatment for cocaine dependence to determine whether the groups differed in pretreatment characteristics, treatment retention, compliance, and cocaine use outcome.
Data were taken from two trials (N=111 in each), in which patients were randomly assigned to groups that used different behavioral treatments (cognitive-behavioral treatment and 12-step facilitation) and pharmacotherapies (desipramine and disulfiram).
Few differences between African Americans and whites were found in terms of demographic characteristics, reasons for seeking treatment, or expectations of treatment. In both studies African Americans and whites did not differ significantly with respect to cocaine use outcomes, but African-American participants completed significantly fewer days of treatment than white participants. In study 2, which was not placebo controlled, African Americans who received disulfiram remained in treatment significantly longer than African Americans who did not receive disulfiram. However, in study 1, in which patients took either desipramine or a placebo, no interactions of ethnicity by medication were found. Among patients who expected improvement to take a month or longer in study 1, African Americans remained in treatment for fewer days than whites.
The behavioral therapies evaluated did not significantly differ in effectiveness for African Americans and whites, suggesting that they are broadly applicable across these ethnic groups. Findings also suggest possible strategies for improving retention of African Americans in treatment. Such strategies might include offering treatment with a medication component and better addressing participants' treatment expectations.
To evaluate reports of renal toxicity associated with intramuscular ketorolac tromethamine. Medical charts were reviewed for all cases of renal toxicity associated with ketorolac therapy.
Patients with possible ketorolac-associated nephrotoxicity were identified through our institution's adverse drug reaction reporting program. Patients were included in this report if: (1) renal insufficiency was temporally related to ketorolac administration; (2) resolution of renal insufficiency occurred after discontinuation of ketorolac; and (3) no other causes of renal insufficiency, including other medications, could be identified.
Six patients had renal insufficiency secondary to ketorolac administration. The mean age of the patients was 58 years and cardiovascular disease was present in five. Serum creatinine values increased from a mean of 106 +/- 26 mumol/L (1.2 +/- 0.3 mg/dL) to a mean peak value of 256 +/- 195 mumol/L (2.9 +/- 2.2 mg/dL). Recovery of renal function was observed after a mean of 2.3 +/- 0.5 days.
Short-term administration of ketorolac can be associated with reversible oliguric renal insufficiency. Indiscriminate use of ketorolac for pain management in place of narcotic analgesics should be avoided, especially in patients at high risk for toxicity induced by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
To report a case of neurologic adverse effects that developed during concomitant treatment with ciprofloxacin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and chloroquine. Possible mechanisms for a drug interaction are discussed.
A 68-year-old woman who was receiving chronic treatment with NSAIDs and chloroquine developed dizziness, anxiety, and tremors when ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily was begun for Salmonella osteitis. When she discontinued the antirheumatic treatment, there was a prompt relief of symptoms. After indomethacin was reintroduced, the patient developed signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, which partially subsided when ciprofloxacin was discontinued.
Enhanced neurologic adverse effects of ciprofloxacin when taken together with NSAIDs or chloroquine may result from reduced effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid. An alternative explanation could be that NSAIDs and chloroquine impair the elimination of ciprofloxacin, thereby contributing to toxic concentrations of the antibiotic.
The possibility of interactions between ciprofloxacin and antirheumatic drugs should be considered.
Populations of amphibians are in decline in certain locations around the world, and the possible contribution of environmental contaminants, including estrogenic compounds, to these declines is of potential concern. In the current study, responses of the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) to exposure to 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), the synthetic estrogen used in oral contraceptives, during the larval period were characterized. Exposure of L. sylvaticus to 1.08, 9.55, or 80.9 μg EE2/L had no effects on survival, growth, or metamorphic endpoints monitored in the current study. However, there were significant effects of exposure to EE2 on phenotypic sex ratios. In general, lesser proportions of L. sylvaticus developed as phenotypic males and greater proportions developed as phenotypic females or with mixed sex phenotypes at all concentrations of EE2 tested. Utilizing the data collected in the current study, the EC(50) for complete feminization of L. sylvaticus was determined to be 7.7 μg EE2/L, and the EC(50) for partial feminization was determined to be 2.3 μg EE2/L. In addition, after chronic exposure, abundances of transcripts of vitellogenin A2, high density lipoprotein binding protein, and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase were 1.8-280-fold greater in livers from L. sylvaticus exposed to EE2 compared to controls. Overall, there were significant effects of exposure to all concentrations of EE2 tested, the least of which was within about 2-fold of estrogen equivalent concentrations previously measured in the environment.
This review of recent articles on ocular toxicology concentrates on undesirable effects on the eye induced by systemically used xenobiotics. These effects include the corticosteroid-induced glaucoma and cataracts (especially in children), chloroquine-induced heart block and retinopathy, its possible protection by platelet aggregating factor antagonists, oculopathy after intracarotid chemotherapy with nitrosyl-urea or cisplatin, ketoconazole-induced papilledema, cytarabine-induced photophobia, ethambutol HCl-induced visual deficits, psychotherapeutic-agent overdose-induced ocular bobbing, amiodarone-induced cataracts, and imipramine HCl-induced angle-closure glaucoma. Also reviewed are the role of hormone levels in diabetic retinopathy, the therapeutic use of clonidine for perioperative intraocular pressure spikes, the increase in ocular blood flow by pentoxifylline, and decrease by nicotine, the potential for the reduction in drop size of mydriatic medications, a theory for sulfonamide-induced myopia, and guidelines for animal models of ocular toxicity. No drug achieves ultimate efficacy or ultimate safety. Thus, the decision to employ a given therapy involves a physician's evaluation of its therapeutic index, the ratio between efficacy and toxicity.
This study was designed to investigate the alterations in the levels of various proteases such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), kallikrein, aminopeptidases, urokinase and plasmin in serum-heart and kidney and to find out whether the changes in the levels of these enzymes could explain the pathogeneses of hypertension induced by Dexamethasone (Dex). Dex was administered to Male Wistar rats (180-200 g body weight) at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg/week subcutaneously on alternate days for 2 weeks. One more week was included in this investigation to oversee the recovery process. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) showed significant elevation during administration and after withdrawal of Dex. The levels of enzymes such as angiotensin converting enzyme, carboxypeptidase-N and leucine aminopeptidase were found to be elevated in serum as well as in tissues. The level of kallikrein was observed to decrease in serum and tissues and that of thrombin, plasmin and urokinase exhibited variations. Thus, treatment with Dex altered the levels of these proteases which might have a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and in altered blood coagulation.
Sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) in blood lymphocytes, serum tumors markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), and urinary excretion of chromium, cobalt and nickel were determined in 26 male workers occupationally exposed to chromium, cobalt and nickel dust and in 25 controls matched for age and smoking habits. The differences in the urinary excretion of metals between exposed persons and controls were statistically significant. An analysis of variance on the SCE rank values revealed that both exposure status (exposed persons vs. controls) and smoking habits (smokers and former smokers vs. never smokers) had a statistically significant effect. For the tumor markers, the analysis of variance did not reveal a statistically significant difference between exposed persons and controls. However, CEA serum levels were significantly correlated not only with smoking habits but also with duration of exposure. As cobalt is only weakly mutagenic, these results suggest that the small amount of absorbed chromium and nickel may have been sufficient to induce SCE. The hypothesis that tumor markers may be increased in groups of subjects exposed to genotoxic substances deserves further study.
Anticancer activity of the rhizomes of turmeric was evaluated in vitro using tissue culture methods and in vivo in mice using Dalton's lymphoma cells grown as ascites form. Turmeric extract inhibited the cell growth in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml and was cytotoxic to lymphocytes and Dalton's lymphoma cells at the same concentration. Cytotoxic effect was found within 30 min at room temperature (30 degrees C). The active constituent was found to be 'curcumin' which showed cytotoxicity to lymphocytes and Dalton's lymphoma cells at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml. Initial experiments indicated that turmeric extract and curcumin reduced the development of animal tumours.
Butaclamol hydrochloride (AY-23,028) is a member of a new chemical class for which antipsychotic activity in humans has recently been demonstrated. The compound antagonized amphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior in rats, amphetamine toxicity in aggregated mice and apomorphine-induced emesis in dogs. It depressed both discriminated avoidance and continuous lever-pressing behavior in rats and inhibited ambulation and rearing in the open field. At higher doses, AY-23,028 induced catalepsy. Adrenergic blocking activity, measured by the antagonism of epinephrine-induced mortality, was weak. These pharmacological actions are characteristic of neuroleptic drugs. In the dose range where the aforementioned effects were observed AY-23,028 did not antagonize either the tetrabenazine-induced ptosis or the tremorine syndrome and did not cause either hypothermia or ataxia. The potency and onset of action of AY-23,028 were comparable to those of fluphenazine but AY-23,028 was of longer duration. The results are discussed in relation to current concepts of neuroleptic mechanisms.
ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment. In the present study, we found that daily doses of lithium, leading to plasma levels ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mEq/liter, delay disease progression in human patients affected by ALS. None of the patients treated with lithium died during the 15 months of the follow-up, and disease progression was markedly attenuated when compared with age-, disease duration-, and sex-matched control patients treated with riluzole for the same amount of time. In a parallel study on a genetic ALS animal model, the G93A mouse, we found a marked neuroprotection by lithium, which delayed disease onset and duration and augmented the life span. These effects were concomitant with activation of autophagy and an increase in the number of the mitochondria in motor neurons and suppressed reactive astrogliosis. Again, lithium reduced the slow necrosis characterized by mitochondrial vacuolization and increased the number of neurons counted in lamina VII that were severely affected in saline-treated G93A mice. After lithium administration in G93A mice, the number of these neurons was higher even when compared with saline-treated WT. All these mechanisms may contribute to the effects of lithium, and these results offer a promising perspective for the treatment of human patients affected by ALS.
Hypoproteinemia, fluid retention, and weight gain are associated with development of acute lung injury and mortality in critically ill patients, without proof of cause and effect. We designed a clinical trial to determine whether diuresis and colloid replacement in hypoproteinemic patients with acute lung injury would improve pulmonary physiology.
Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
All adult intensive care units from two university hospitals.
Thirty-seven mechanically-ventilated patients with acute lung injury and serum total protein </=5.0 g/dL.
Five-day protocolized regimen of 25 g of human serum albumin every 8 hrs with continuous infusion furosemide, or dual placebo, targeted to diuresis, weight loss, and serum total protein.
Measured outcomes included change in weight, serum total protein, fluid balance, hemodynamics, respiratory system compliance, and oxygenation. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (treatment, n = 19; control, n = 18), with trauma being the major cause of acute lung injury. Diuresis and weight loss over 5 days (5.3 kg more in the treatment group, p =.04) was accompanied by improvements in the Pao2/Fio2 ratio in the treatment group within 24 hrs (from 171 to 236, p =.02). Respiratory mechanics were unchanged. Mean arterial pressure increased from 80 to 88 mm Hg (p =.10), and heart rate decreased from 110 to 95 beats/min (p =.008) over time in the treatment group. No difference in mortality was observed, with favorable trends in measures of intensive care.
Albumin and furosemide therapy improves fluid balance, oxygenation, and hemodynamics in hypoproteinemic patients with acute lung injury. Determining the effect of this simple therapy on cost, outcomes, and other patient populations requires further study.
Oncogenes of fibrosarcomas of rats, induced by subcutaneous injection of 1,8-dinitropyrene (1,8-DNP), were examined by NIH 3T3 cell transfection assay and Southern blot analysis. Transformants containing rat specific repetitive sequences were obtained with DNAs of 4 fibrosarcomas, 1,8-DNP1, 1,8-DNP2, 1,8-DNP3 and 1,8-DNP7. A transformant, 1,8-DNP2-2, induced by DNA of a fibrosarcoma, 1,8-DNP2, and 7 secondary transformants derived from it contained rat K-ras sequences. Another transformant, 1,8-DNP2-1, induced by the same sarcoma did not have a ras family oncogene. This indicates that the sarcoma, 1,8-DNP2, has at least 2 transforming genes. The transforming genes of 6 other transformants derived from 3 sarcomas did not contain ras family or neu transforming genes.
The oncological and obstetrical follow-up is described of 321 patients who presented between 1981 and 1988 in the St Radboud Hospital with a history of intrauterine diethylstilbestrol(DES) exposure. In 45 out of 321 cases cytological abnormalities were found including 20 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). No relation could be established between CIN and the extension of the cervical adenosis. Twenty-two percent of 87 evaluable pregnancies terminated in spontaneous abortion, 13 percent of the patients delivered immaturely and 27 percent prematurely. These percentages were significantly higher than in the rest of the hospital population. The consequences of intrauterine exposure to DES are discussed. Full examination of the patients is advised, including colposcopy and hysterosalpingography. If abnormalities are present it is advised to offer a timely cerclage in case of pregnancy.
The dopamine precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA) is currently the most efficacious noninvasive therapy for Parkinson's disease. A major complication of this therapy, however, is the appearance of the abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias. We have developed a model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in mice that reproduces the main clinical features of dyskinesia in humans.
Dyskinetic symptoms were triggered by repetitive administration of a constant dose of L-DOPA (25 mg/kg, twice a day, for 25 days) in unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned mice. Mice were examined for behavior, expression of FosB, neuropeptides, and externally regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation.
Dyskinetic symptoms appear toward the end of the first week of treatment and are associated with L-DOPA-induced changes in DeltaFosB and prodynorphin expression. L-DOPA also induces activation of ERK1/2 in the dopamine-depleted striatum. Interestingly, elevated FosB/DeltaFosB expression occurs exclusively within completely lesioned regions of the striatum, displaying an inverse correlation with remaining dopaminergic terminals. Following acute L-DOPA treatment, FosB expression occurs in direct striatal output neurons, whereas chronic L-DOPA also induces FosB expression in nitric oxide synthase-positive striatal interneurons.
This model provides a system in which genetic manipulation of individual genes can be used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development and expression of dyskinesia.
Hyperbaric oxygenation is known to affect energy metabolism and endothelial cell structure and function, but its effects on peripheral nerve have not been reported. We investigated whether it would (i) reverse established streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy, a condition in which endoneurial hypoxia exists; (ii) affect energy metabolism in nerve; and (iii) alter the blood-nerve barrier. Sprague-Dawley rats that had been diabetic for 3 months and age-matched controls were used in these studies. One diabetic group and one control group were treated with hyperbaric oxygenation (2 atm for 2 h, 5 days/week) for 4 weeks. Identical groups remained in room air. Sciatic nerve adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate, lactate, and glucose concentrations showed similar changes at rest in both room air and after hyperbaric oxygenation. Nerves of control and diabetic groups exhibited increased lactate production and increased utilization of glucose, ATP, and creatine phosphate after 15 min of anoxia. The albumin blood-nerve barrier index was increased in control and diabetic nerves after hyperbaric treatment. Nerve conduction velocity was reduced in the diabetic-room air group and not improved by hyperbaric oxygenation. Caudal nerve action potential, which was significantly reduced in this group, was normalized after hyperbaric treatment. Resistance to ischemic conduction failure was increased in untreated diabetic nerve but not significantly different from controls after hyperbaric exposure. These findings indicate that treatment with hyperbaric oxygenation will partially reverse the neuropathy encountered in chronic diabetes. The biochemical changes are suggestive of enhanced nerve energy metabolism induced by hyperbaric oxygenation. The altered albumin blood-nerve barrier index presumably results from the action of free radicals on endothelial cells.
The genetic causes of malformations of cortical development (MCD) remain largely unknown. Here we report the discovery of multiple pathogenic missense mutations in TUBG1, DYNC1H1 and KIF2A, as well as a single germline mosaic mutation in KIF5C, in subjects with MCD. We found a frequent recurrence of mutations in DYNC1H1, implying that this gene is a major locus for unexplained MCD. We further show that the mutations in KIF5C, KIF2A and DYNC1H1 affect ATP hydrolysis, productive protein folding and microtubule binding, respectively. In addition, we show that suppression of mouse Tubg1 expression in vivo interferes with proper neuronal migration, whereas expression of altered γ-tubulin proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupts normal microtubule behavior. Our data reinforce the importance of centrosomal and microtubule-related proteins in cortical development and strongly suggest that microtubule-dependent mitotic and postmitotic processes are major contributors to the pathogenesis of MCD.
Propofol (Disoprivan, AstraZeneca AG, Zug, Switzerland) has long been considered to be nonanalgesic. However, accumulating evidence shows that propofol possesses modulatory action on pain processing and perception. In this study, the authors investigated the modulatory effects of propofol and a formulation similar to the solvent of propofol (10% Intralipid; Fresenius Kabi, Stans, Switzerland) on pain perception and central sensitization in healthy volunteers.
Fourteen healthy volunteers were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Intracutaneous electrical stimulation (48.8 +/- 25.8 mA) induced spontaneous acute pain (Numeric Rating Scale, 6 of 10) and stable areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia. Pain intensities and areas of hyperalgesia were assessed regularly before, during, and after a 45-min target-controlled infusion (2 microg/ml) of propofol, the solvent 10% Intralipid, and saline.
During administration, propofol significantly decreased pain scores and areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia compared with both 10% Intralipid and saline (placebo-corrected mean Numerical Rating Scale score reduction by propofol: 38 +/- 28%). This difference disappeared shortly after cessation of the infusion. Thereafter, no significant group differences were observed in the Numerical Rating Scale score and the areas of hyperalgesia or allodynia. However, there was a trend to reduced hyperalgesia and allodynia after propofol treatment. Pharmacodynamic modeling regarding the analgesic effect of propofol showed an EC50 (half-maximum effect site concentration) of 3.19 +/- 0.37 microg/ml. Ten percent Intralipid was free of pain-modulatory effects in the authors' experiments.
Propofol showed short-lasting analgesic properties during its administration, whereas the solvent-like formulation 10% Intralipid had no effect on pain perception.
The relative lack of overlapping toxicities and less-than-complete cross-resistance of tumors treated with both carboplatin and cisplatin may allow these two analogues to be given in combination to exploit platinum dose intensity therapeutics. Early experience with combined platinum regimens, however, found myelosuppression, particularly severe thrombocytopenia, to be dose-limiting. It was postulated that a 2-day interval between carboplatin and cisplatin would allow for near complete clearance of the former before cisplatin administration and a potential gain in dose intensity.
Other carboplatin-cisplatin regimens produced Grade 3-4 toxicity in 20% of patients. By defining 95% confidence limits around this observed rate of Grade 3-4 toxicity, the accrual needs of this study were determined in a two-stage process. Sixteen patients with advanced malignancies were entered onto a trial of 300 mg/m2 of carboplatin on day 1, followed by 125 mg/m2 of cisplatin on day 3 every 28 days. Hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity was closely monitored, including the use of serial audiograms, to allow appropriate dose modification.
A total of 40 courses of combination platinum therapy was administered to 15 patients who were evaluable for toxicity. Higher-than-anticipated ototoxicity and neurosensory toxicity was observed. WHO Grade 3 ototoxicity (hearing loss) was documented in 12 of 15 patients (80.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.0-97.0%) and emerged as the dose-limiting side effect of this regimen. High-frequency hearing loss, as demonstrated by conventional audiograms, was universal among all 12 patients who received at least 2 courses of combination platinum therapy (100%, 95% CI: 73.5-100%). Grade 2 or 3 neurosensory toxicity also was observed in 4 of 15 patients. Hematologic toxicity was manageable. WHO Grade 3-4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurred in only 14% and 11%, respectively, of 40 courses. There was no evidence of cumulative marrow toxicity. Calculated dose intensities (mg/m2/week) were 94 +/- 26.0 for carboplatin, 39.3 +/- 12.4 for cisplatin, and 64.0 +/- 19.2 for the combination (expressed as cisplatin equivalents). Objective responses (complete response+partial response) occurred in 8 of 16 subjects (50.0%, 95% CI: 24.7-75.4%), with 1 patient achieving a complete response of 14+months.
The schedule of day 1 carboplatin plus day 3 cisplatin every 4 weeks appeared to allow a higher platinum dose intensity with less myelotoxicity than previously reported schedules combining these two analogues. Ototoxicity, however, was unexpectedly severe and limits future prospects for the use of combined platinum analogues to achieve dose intensification.
We describe 2 cases of endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that failed to respond to intravenous linezolid therapy but were successfully treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus gentamicin and vancomycin plus rifampin.
Ginseng total saponin (GTS) inhibited methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity and conditioned place preference (CPP). Dopamine (DA) receptor supersensitivity was developed in methamphetamine-induced CPP mice and it was inhibited by GTS. GTS also inhibited apomorphine-induced climbing behavior, showing the antidopaminergic activity of GTS. These results suggest that GTS inhibition of the methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity and CPP may be closely related with the inhibition of dopaminergic activation induced by methamphetamine.
Although there are few differences in the incidence and pathophysiology of acne across various races and ethnicities, there is some evidence that black patients may have larger sebaceous glands and increased sebum production. Of greater clinical relevance, patients with darker skin types are at increased risk for the development of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which some find as or more troubling than acne itself. This common and bothersome sequelum of acne can be difficult to manage in this population. Topical azelaic acid gel is recognized to have anti-tyrosinase activity, suggesting it may be a suitable treatment option for mild-to-moderate acne with associated moderate-to-severe PIH. This pilot study demonstrates the efficacy of topical AzA gel 15% when applied twice daily for the reduction of both acne and PIH. J
Bisphosphonates (BPs) are used currently in the treatment of patients with bone metastases because these compounds inhibit bone resorption. We examined here the effects of BPs on inhibition of endothelial cell functions in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of endothelial cells with BPs (clodronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid) reduced proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased capillary-like tube formation in vitro. Quantification of blood vessels in bone biopsy specimens from patients with Paget's disease before and after clodronate treatment showed a 40% reduction of the vascularization after BP treatment. However, such a decreased vascularity could be secondary to a reduction of bone resorption. Therefore, the tissue distribution of [14C]BPs in male rats was examined to develop an angiogenesis model in a noncalcified tissue where BPs could accumulate. [14C]BPs (zoledronic acid, ibandronate, and clodronate) not only accumulated in bone but also transiently accumulated in the prostate. The effects of BPs on testosterone-induced revascularization of the prostate gland in castrated rats were then studied. Testosterone in combination with ibandronate or zoledronic acid induced a 17-35% reduction of the prostate weight compared with castrated rats treated with testosterone alone. Blood vessel immunostaining on prostate tissue sections revealed that both ibandronate and zoledronic acid induced a 50% reduction of the revascularization of the prostate gland. Moreover, zoledronic acid did not alter testosterone-induced activity of a luciferase gene reporter construct transfected in androgen-dependent prostatic cells, indicating that this BP did not directly interfere with testosterone. In conclusion, BPs have in vivo antiangiogenic properties, which could be of relevance to improve therapy and prevention of bone metastasis. In addition, our results extend the potential clinical use of BPs to patients with early prostate cancer.
Brain phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels are regulated by a balance between synthesis and hydrolysis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1alpha/beta) activate phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and PC-phospholipase C (PC-PLC) to hydrolyze PC. PC hydrolysis by PLA(2) releases free fatty acids including arachidonic acid, and lyso-PC, an inhibitor of CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT). Arachidonic acid metabolism by cyclooxygenases/lipoxygenases is a significant source of reactive oxygen species. CDP-choline might increase the PC levels by attenuating PLA(2) stimulation and loss of CCT activity. TNF-alpha also stimulates proteolysis of CCT. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are induced in brain ischemia and may disrupt PC homeostasis by increasing its hydrolysis (increase PLA(2) and PC-PLC activities) and inhibiting its synthesis (decrease CCT activity). The beneficial effects of CDP-choline may result by counteracting TNF-alpha and/or IL-1 mediated events, integrating cytokine biology and lipid metabolism. Re-evaluation of CDP-choline phase III stroke clinical trial data is encouraging and future trails are warranted. CDP-choline is non-xenobiotic, safe, well tolerated, and can be considered as one of the agents in multi-drug treatment of stroke.
