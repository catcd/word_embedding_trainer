A previous report showed that the atypical neuroleptic clozapine resulted in marked changes in urodynamic parameters and greatly inhibited the activity of the external urethral sphincter in anesthetized rats. Such findings may help explain the high incidence of urinary disturbances reported during clozapine therapy. In an effort to extend our observations to other atypical neuroleptic agents, the present study investigated the effects of two newer atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine and risperidone, on the bladder and external urethral sphincter during cystometry in anesthetized rats.
At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.), olanzapine decreased the micturition volume and increased the residual volume. In addition, olanzapine decreased the expulsion time and the amplitude of the high frequency oscillations observed during the expulsion phase. Larger doses (1 mg/kg) had a greater effect. Olanzapine also reduced the activity recorded from the external urethral sphincter, and the bursting observed during the expulsion phase was abolished by 1.0 mg/kg. Risperidone had similar effects although the maximal effects were smaller than those observed with olanzapine. The amplitude of bladder contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve was reduced by olanzapine but not risperidone suggesting a possible anti-muscarinic peripheral effect of olanzapine.
Olanzapine and risperidone significantly altered several voiding parameters and decreased the activity of the external urethral sphincter in the anesthetized rat. We propose that these effects are due to the central action of these drugs and not to peripheral effects. These findings may explain some of the clinical reports of urinary incontinence with risperidone and may predict similar occurrences with olanzapine therapy.
Deep-vein thrombosis (D.V.T.) was detected by the fibrinogen-uptake test in six out of a total of thirty-one young women undergoing emergency abdominal surgery who gave a history of recent oral contraceptive intake. In contrast, no D.V.T. developed in nineteen similar patients who were not on oral contraceptives (P less than 0-01). Plasma-antithrombin-III activity was significantly lower preoperatively in patients taking oral contraceptives; postoperative D.V.T. subsequently developed in three out of five patients with preoperative antithrombin-III activity below 50%. In seventy-eight dental patients undergoing molar extraction, antithrombin-III activity was measured before, during, and after operation. Activity fell in all patients during operation, but the fall was significantly greater in women taking oral contraceptives (P less than 0-01). The intra-operative fall in antithrombin-III activity was prevented by a small preoperative dose of subcutaneous heparin.
The development of acute dystonic reactions was monitored in 202 acute psychiatric patients during initial hospitalization and treatment with various neuroleptic drugs in a prospective study. Data were analyzed to determine the effect of anticholinergic prophylaxis, age, sex, and type and dosage of neuroleptic on the incidence of dystonic reactions. Nearly 90% of dystonic reactions occurred by the third day of treatment. The overall trend favored the prophylactic use of antiparkinsonian drugs with all neuroleptics, and the effect of this prophylaxis with haloperidol was statistically significant. Because anticholinergic prophylaxis was used more often when larger dosages of neuroleptics were prescribed, an added effect in the observed trend for fewer dystonic reactions is suggested.
Of eight young women, seven had a diagnosis of well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma and one had atypical endometrial hyperplasia. The average age was 40.1 years, with 6.04 years of dimethisterone-ethinyl estradiol (Oracon) sequential contraceptive use. The patients were not typical of those in whom endometrial carcinoma develops. Although these cases do not prove that long-term administration of dimethisterone-ethinyl estradiol causes endometrial adenocarcinoma or atypia, they indicate that it may do so.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER stress-associated unfolded protein response (UPR) can promote cancer cell survival, but it remains unclear whether they can influence oncogene-induced senescence. The present study examined the role of ER stress in senescence using oncogene-dependent models. Increased ER stress attenuated senescence in part by up-regulating phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) and decreasing phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK). A positive feed forward loop between p-AKT, ER stress, and UPR was discovered whereby a transient increase of ER stress caused reduced senescence and promotion of tumorigenesis. Decreased ER stress was further correlated with increased senescence in both mouse and human tumors. Interestingly, H-RAS-expressing Pparβ/δ null cells and tumors having increased cell proliferation exhibited enhanced ER stress, decreased cellular senescence, and/or enhanced tumorigenicity. Collectively, these results demonstrate a new role for ER stress and UPR that attenuates H-RAS-induced senescence and suggest that PPARβ/δ can repress this oncogene-induced ER stress to promote senescence in accordance with its role as a tumor modifier that suppresses carcinogenesis.
Over a period of 2 months, a 60-year-old man, a chicken breeder, experienced low back pain, lower limb weakness predominant on the right side, and urinary difficulties, leading progressively to a flaccid paraplegia with sphincter impairment. Concomitant poor cognitive performances were noted. MRI showed enlargement of the conus terminalis, with a low-intensity signal on T1-weighted images, high-intensity signal on T2-weighted images, and areas of intramedullar contrast enhancement. A biopsy of the lesion showed macrophages containing yeast cells, with PAS and Grocott staining aspects compatible with the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc). A brain MRI showed multiple localizations in the brain stem and in both hemispheres with associated edema. Disseminated histoplasmosis was confirmed by a biopsy of a sub-maxillary ganglion demonstrating a necrotic tuberculoid lymphadenitis containing yeast cells resembling Hc. Immune tests disclosed the presence of HTLV1 anti-bodies without immunodeficiency nor HIV co-infection. An anti-micotic treatment was started 2 weeks after surgery, with intra-venous amphotericin B, for 21 days, followed by itraconazole, orally for 90 days. Cognitive functions improved significantly in 5 weeks while paraplegia and sphincter impairment remained unchanged. Seven months later, cerebral MR aspects dramatically improved while the conus medullaris lesion diminished, and the edematous component disappeared in all areas. Even though histoplasmosis is endemic in our region, CNS localization is rare, generally in disseminated forms associated with immunodeficiency. Brain granulomas are well-known, but spinal cord histoplasmomas are exceptional: only four cases have been evaluated by MRI. Unlike our case, spinal cord forms generally improve, due to surgery associated with antifungus medication, or sometimes due to specific medical treatment alone but with sufficient dosage.
Intrathecal baclofen administered by means of an implantable pump is being increasingly used for successful treatment of spasticity. Meningitis following intrathecally administered baclofen is a rare but serious complication that is difficult to treat without removal of the pump. Because success rates with intravenously administered antibiotic drugs for the treatment of meningitis have been low, intrathecal administration of antibiotic agents is often required to eradicate the pathogen. The authors report the case of a patient in whom Staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis developed after insertion of an intrathecal baclofen pump. The patient was successfully treated by intrathecal coadministration of vancomycin and baclofen.
We describe a patient who developed pancerebellar syndrome as a result of hyperthermia that developed after cocaine use. The patient had long-standing schizophrenia and had been taking risperidone for 2 years, without evidence of abnormal movements. A literature review revealed a marked similarity between cocaine and neuroleptics in their ability to cause hyperthermia. Based on our observations and the compatible evidence from the literature, we suggest that cocaine use may cause hyperthermia and result in chronic pancerebellar dysfunction.
Alterations in the neoplastic activity of cyclophosphamide (CPA) by the extract of Alstonia scholaris(ASE) were studied in mice transplanted with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC). The tumor-bearing animals were injected with various doses of ASE and 25 mg/kg of CPA (1/10th of the LD50 dose). The combination of 120 mg/kg of ASE with 25 mg/kg of CPA was most effective, as it caused the highest tumor regression and enhanced the mean survival time (MST) and the average survival time (AST) up to 42 and 40.7, as against the 29 and 27.5 of CPA alone, respectively. Similarly, when 120 mg/kg of ASE was combined with different doses of CPA (3.125 to 50 mg/kg), a dose-dependent increase in the anticancer activity was observed up to 25 mg/kg of CPA. However, a further increase in the CPA dose up to 37.5 or 50 mg/kg resulted in toxic side effects and death. The best effect was observed when 120 mg/kg of ASE was combined with 25 mg/kg followed by 12.5 mg/kg of CPA, as evident by the greater tumor remission, when compared with the concurrent doses of either drug alone. The administration of 120 mg/kg of ASE 6 h before the administration of 25 mg/kg of CPA resulted in a drastic decline in the glutathione levels and increased the lipid peroxidation considerably when compared with either drug alone.
Several studies and reports suggest an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients treated with conventional antipsychotic drugs, as well as with clozapine. We report the case of a 25-year-old man with early-onset schizo-affective disorder, with no identified risk factor for thromboembolism, who developed pulmonary embolism on three occasions, once shortly after initiating treatment with olanzapine and twice with risperidone. This case indicates that VTE can be associated with the use of olanzapine and risperidone, two atypical agents having similar properties and the same 5HT2 receptors antagonism, possibly implicated in this adverse event. As suggested by this observation, patients who have had one episode of VTE with antipsychotics with an affinity for 5HT2 receptors should receive neuroleptics from other classes, such as amisulpride, which does not interact with 5HT2 receptors. They should also be closely monitored to ensure early detection and prompt treatment of VTE.
Prenatal exposure to oral anticoagulants during pregnancy may result in defective fetal development or life-threatening hemorrhage. Fetal exposure during the first eight weeks of pregnancy may cause abnormal development of the facial structures, hypoplastic digits, strippled epiphyses, and mental retardation. Midtrimester exposure may result in optic atrophy, faulty brain growth, and developmental retardation. Third-trimester exposure may produce fetal anticoagulation, predisposing the infant to life-threatening hemorrhage in the perinatal period. Anticoagulation with heparin sodium does not provide a clearly safe alternative, since this therapy has been associated with excessive fetal loss.
Cadmium is a nonessential heavy metal and a well-known persistent environmental pollutant. It causes a variety of toxic effects, including immunotoxicity. The exact mechanism of its cellular effects still is unclear. Cell-cycle regulation is an important factor that modulates cell death; however, cadmium-mediated cell-cycle arrest leading to cell death in murine macrophages has not been investigated. Cadmium at 20 microM induced both apoptotic and necrotic death in murine macrophage (J774A.1) cultures at 24 h. Cadmium at 20 microM triggered re-entry of G0/G1 to the next phase and increased the number of cells in the G2/M phase at 24 h. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) correlated with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 induction. Inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 resulted in G0/G1 arrest and partially released the cadmium-mediated G2/M arrest. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PD98059 strongly attenuated cadmium-induced necrotic cell death, but did not prevent caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Necrosis rather than apoptosis was caused by cadmium-induced ERK signaling in J774A.1 cells. A scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), N-acetylcystein, decreased cadmium-induced ERK activation and necrotic cell death, suggesting that cadmium induces the ROS-ERK-p21WAF1/CIP1 signaling pathway, leading to G2/M arrest and cell death. These findings may be important in further understanding the cellular mechanisms of cadmium toxicity to provide information to assess objectively risk for this metal.
Furan is a rodent hepatotoxicant and carcinogen. Because this compound is an important industrial intermediate and has been detected in heat-processed foods and smoke, humans are likely exposed to this toxic compound. Characterization of urinary metabolites of furan will lead to the development of biomarkers to assess human health risks associated with furan exposure. Previous studies indicate that furan is oxidized to a reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated dialdehyde, cis-2-butene-1,4-dial (BDA), in a reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450. Five previously characterized metabolites are derived from the reaction of BDA with cellular nucleophiles such as glutathione and protein. They include the monoglutathione reaction product, N-[4-carboxy-4-(3-mercapto-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1-oxobutyl]-l-cysteinylglycine cyclic sulfide, and its downstream metabolite, S-[1-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl]methylthiol, as well as (R)-2-acetylamino-6-(2,5-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1-hexanoic acid and N-acetyl-S-[1-(5-acetylamino-5-carboxypentyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl]-l-cysteine and its sulfoxide. The last two compounds are downstream metabolites of a BDA-derived cysteine-lysine cross-link, S-[1-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl]-l-cysteine. In this report, we present the characterization of seven additional urinary furan metabolites, all of which are derived from this cross-link. The cysteinyl residue is subject to several biotransformation reactions, including N-acetylation and S-oxidation. Alternatively, it can undergo beta-elimination followed by S-methylation to a methylthiol intermediate that is further oxidized to a sulfoxide. The lysine portion of the cross-link either is N-acetylated or undergoes a transamination reaction to generate an alpha-ketoacid metabolite that undergoes oxidative decarboxylation. Some of these metabolites are among the most abundant furan metabolites present in urine as judged by LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that the oxidation of furan to BDA and BDA's subsequent reaction with cellular cysteine and lysine residues may represent a significant in vivo pathway of furan biotransformation. Because they are derived from cellular BDA reaction products, these metabolites are markers of furan exposure and bioactivation and could be explored as potential biomarkers in human studies.
Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most frequent cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. Schisandra sphenanthera is a traditional hepato-protective Chinese medicine and Schisandrol B (SolB) is one of its major active constituents. In this study, the protective effect of SolB against APAP-induced acute hepatotoxicity in mice and the involved mechanisms were investigated. Morphological and biochemical assessments clearly demonstrated a protective effect of SolB against APAP-induced liver injury. SolB pretreatment significantly attenuated the increases in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity, and prevented elevated hepatic malondialdehyde formation and the depletion of mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) in a dose-dependent manner. SolB also dramatically altered APAP metabolic activation by inhibiting the activities of CYP2E1 and CYP3A11, which was evidenced by significant inhibition of the formation of the oxidized APAP metabolite NAPQI-GSH. A molecular docking model also predicted that SolB had potential to interact with the CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 active sites. In addition, SolB abrogated APAP-induced activation of p53 and p21, and increased expression of liver regeneration and antiapoptotic-related proteins such as cyclin D1 (CCND1), PCNA, and BCL-2. This study demonstrated that SolB exhibited a significant protective effect toward APAP-induced liver injury, potentially through inhibition of CYP-mediated APAP bioactivation and regulation of the p53, p21, CCND1, PCNA, and BCL-2 to promote liver regeneration.
Folpet, an agricultural fungicide, induces tumors in the mouse gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the duodenum. Bioassays show a threshold for tumors at ~1000 ppm dietary administration. We investigated the early histologic changes to the mouse duodenum in mice fed a diet containing 6000 ppm folpet for 28 days. Reversibility of folpet-induced changes was evaluated after treatment for 28 days and a recovery period of 17 days. Macroscopic changes in the cecum (dilatation) and duodenum (roughening) were evident by day 7, continued through day 28, then returned to normal by recovery day 17. The duodenal mucosa also appeared to be thickened. Macroscopic changes to the forestomach were also evident as a rough surface or depressions; they also decreased in incidence and severity in the recovery animals. Histologic changes of the duodenum (crypt cell hyperplasia, villous hypertrophy, numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes, and elongation of epithelial columnar cells) were evident in all treated mice by day 7 and continued and increased in severity through 28 days of administration. The incidence and severity of these findings was reduced on recovery day 17, indicating reversibility. Histologic changes (epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis) of the non-glandular squamous epithelium in the forestomach occurred later than the changes to the duodenum. The incidence and severity of these changes also lessened by recovery day 17. These early histologic changes support a non-DNA reactive mode of action for folpet carcinogenicity in mice involving the key events of mucosal cytotoxicity with consequent regenerative proliferation. Exposures that are not sufficient to produce cytotoxicity would also not lead to tumor formation.
Vasodilatation and hypotension are thought to be harmful in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Etomidate is preferred to propofol for anaesthesia induction in haemodynamically unstable patients, but may disturb cortisol synthesis. We assessed the haemodynamic effects of etomidate vs. propofol as anaesthesia induction agents, and the effects of these drugs on cortisol concentrations, in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The main end-point of the study was the incidence of hypotension.
Sixty-six patients with severe aortic stenosis scheduled for elective aortic valve replacement were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized to receive either propofol or etomidate for induction of anaesthesia. Haemodynamic parameters, i.e. mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac index (CI), were measured. If MAP decreased below 70 mmHg for more than 30 s, phenylephedrine was administered. Serum cortisol concentrations were also measured.
MAP decreased in all patients (P < 0.001). MAP decreased to a greater extent in patients receiving propofol than in those receiving etomidate (P = 0.006). Patients receiving propofol needed phenylephedrine more often than those receiving etomidate (20/30 vs. 8/30, P = 0.002). CI and PCWP decreased in both groups (P < 0.001), with no difference between the groups. Patients receiving etomidate had a lower serum cortisol concentration immediately after the operation than those receiving propofol (P < 0.001), but no differences between the groups were observed on the first post-operative morning.
Propofol is twice as likely as etomidate to evoke hypotension in anaesthesia induction of patients with severe aortic stenosis; however, etomidate transiently decreases post-operative serum cortisol concentrations.
The effects of isoflurane-induced hypotension to mean aortic pressures of 70 and 55 mmHg on global and regional right and left ventricular performance (ultrasonic dimension technique) and on coronary hemodynamics (electromagnetic flow probes) were studied in 12 open-chest dogs (anesthetized and paralyzed by continuous infusions of fentanyl and pancuronium) with critical coronary artery stenoses (micrometer-controlled snares) of the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries. The stenoses reduced resting coronary blood flow by approximately 10% without affecting global or regional myocardial performance. During subsequent isoflurane administration, coronary blood flow fell markedly. In the areas supplied by the stenosed coronary arteries, segment length shortening decreased by 70% (P less than 0.01), and regional akinesis, paradoxical motion, or postsystolic shortening developed in 9 of 12 animals. In contrast, in the areas supplied by normal coronary arteries, myocardial segment length shortening decreased significantly less and did not show signs of dysfunction. In these non-ischemic areas at both concentrations of isoflurane, end diastolic and systolic dimensions were greater in the right than in the left ventricle, probably related to differences in right (unchanged) and left (reduced) ventricular afterloads. The data indicate that in the presence of coronary artery stenoses, isoflurane-induced hypotension may cause regional myocardial dysfunction suggestive of ischemia.
The effects of isoflurane-induced hypotension to mean aortic pressures of 70 and 55 mmHg on global and regional right (RV) and left (LV) ventricular performance (ultrasonic dimension technique), and on coronary, systemic, and pulmonary hemodynamics (electromagnetic flow probes) were studied in 12 open-chest dogs anesthetized and paralyzed by continuous infusions of fentanyl and pancuronium. Isoflurane caused dose-dependent decreases in LV and RV dP/dt, and in myocardial segment shortening in the presence of unchanged heart rate, unchanged or increased (RV) preload, and unchanged (RV) or decreased (LV) afterload. RV and LV functions were affected differently: at a mean aortic pressure of 70 mmHg (mean inspired isoflurane 1.2%), RV end diastolic dimensions and pressure remained unchanged, whereas those of the LV decreased. At a mean aortic pressure of 55 mmHg (mean inspired isoflurane 1.8%), RV end diastolic dimensions and pressure increased above control, whereas those of the LV remained unchanged. Within the RV, inflow and outflow tract were affected quantitatively similarly, but dyssynchrony developed in four animals. Isoflurane caused dose-dependent decreases in coronary and systemic vascular resistances, but no change in pulmonary vascular resistance. At the lower concentration of isoflurane, coronary blood flow did not fall despite decreased LV and RV dP/dt, unchanged heart rate, unchanged or decreased preload, and unchanged or reduced afterload. The data indicate that isoflurane is a myocardial depressant and a potent coronary vasodilator. At both concentrations, LV function was better preserved than RV function, most likely due to the different effects of isoflurane on RV (unchanged) and LV (reduced) afterload.
We have previously used the rat 4 day Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) model to screen compounds with potential to reduce osteoarthritic pain. The aim of this study was to identify genes altered in this model of osteoarthritic pain and use this information to infer analgesic potential of compounds based on their own gene expression profiles using the Connectivity Map approach.
Using microarrays, we identified differentially expressed genes in L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from rats that had received intraplantar CFA for 4 days compared to matched, untreated control animals. Analysis of these data indicated that the two groups were distinguishable by differences in genes important in immune responses, nerve growth and regeneration. This list of differentially expressed genes defined a "CFA signature". We used the Connectivity Map approach to identify pharmacologic agents in the Broad Institute Build02 database that had gene expression signatures that were inversely related ('negatively connected') with our CFA signature. To test the predictive nature of the Connectivity Map methodology, we tested phenoxybenzamine (an alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist) - one of the most negatively connected compounds identified in this database - for analgesic activity in the CFA model. Our results indicate that at 10 mg/kg, phenoxybenzamine demonstrated analgesia comparable to that of Naproxen in this model.
Evaluation of phenoxybenzamine-induced analgesia in the current study lends support to the utility of the Connectivity Map approach for identifying compounds with analgesic properties in the CFA model.
Hypertension, severe headache, and grand mal seizures developed in a 13-year-old girl after ingestion of one nonprescription diet pill containing phenylpropanolamine and caffeine. This case is at least the sixth report of seizures with phenylpropanolamine use in children or adolescents. Phenylpropanolamine ingestion must be included in the differential diagnosis of young patients, particularly adolescents, in whom acute neurological symptoms develop.
We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years. Thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed iridocyclitis. Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis. However, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age. Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry. Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases. Forty-four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency. Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics. Despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies. Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively. We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs. Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found. Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases. This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously. Surgical treatment of cataracts, band keratopathy, and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results.
Salmeterol is a beta-agonist with bronchodilator properties that last for at least 12 h after inhalation. However, the onset of action of salmeterol immediately after inhalation has not been sufficiently investigated. In the present study, the onset of action and tremor-inducing effect of two doses of inhaled salmeterol (50 and 100 microg) were compared with inhaled salbutamol (200 and 400 microg) and placebo. Lung function was measured using forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and tremor was measured using a linear accelerometer. With salbutamol there was rapid bronchodilation, both doses producing more than 15% improvement in mean FEV1 within 2 mins of inhalation. With salmeterol, on the other hand, significant bronchodilation was delayed until 7 mins versus placebo, and the full bronchodilation effect was not achieved until 60 mins after inhalation. There was a much more rapid onset of tremor with salbutamol (400 microg) than salmeterol. There was a much slower onset of bronchodilation with salmeterol than salbutamol. Therefore, salmeterol cannot be recommended to relieve acute symptoms.
It is well known that long-term use of levodopa by patients with Parkinson's disease causes dyskinesia. Several methods have been proposed for the automatic, unsupervised detection and classification of levodopa induced dyskinesia. Recently, we have demonstrated that neural networks are highly successful to detect dyskinesia and to distinguish dyskinesia from voluntary movements. The aim of this study was to use the trained neural networks to extract parameters, which are important to distinguish between dyskinesia and voluntary movements. Thirteen patients were continuously monitored in a home-like situation performing in about 35 daily life tasks for a period of approximately 2.5 h. Behavior of the patients was measured using triaxial accelerometers, which were placed at six different positions of the body. A neural network was trained to assess the severity of dyskinesia. The neural network was able to assess the severity of dyskinesia and could distinguish dyskinesia from voluntary movements in daily life. For the trunk and the leg, the important parameters appeared to be the percentage of time that the trunk or leg was moving and the standard deviation of the segment velocity of the less dyskinetic leg. For the arm, the combination of the percentage of time, that the wrist was moving, and the percentage of time, that a patient was sitting, explained the largest part of the variance of the output. Dyskinesia differs from voluntary movements in the fact that dyskinetic movements tend to have lower frequencies than voluntary movements and in the fact that movements of different body segments are not well coordinated in dyskinesia.
Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channels regulate vascular tone in different vascular systems. Moreover, activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) contain BK(Ca) channels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of BK(Ca) channels in the regulation of vascular tone in control (CT) and carbon tetrachloride-cirrhotic (CH) rat livers.
Changes in intrahepatic vascular resistance were assessed by evaluating the portal perfusion pressure (PP) response to methoxamine (Mtx) in the presence of Iberiotoxin (Ibtx; a BK(Ca) channel blocker), NS1619 (a BK(Ca) channel opener), Ibtx plus the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) or L-NNA alone. In addition, in CH livers, PP dose-response curves to the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP), were performed after pre-incubation with Ibtx or its vehicle. BK(Ca) mRNA expression was assessed in liver homogenates, and BK(Ca) protein expression in HSC isolated from CT and CH livers.
In CH livers, Ibtx significantly increased baseline PP and exacerbated the PP response to Mtx. Conversely, NS1619 induced a mild nonsignificant decrease of baseline PP and attenuated the hyperresponse to Mtx. CH livers exhibited an upregulation of both mRNA and protein of the alpha-subunit of BK(Ca).
Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels are overexpressed in CH livers and might represent a compensatory mechanism modulating the increased hepatic vascular tone of cirrhosis.
In 1976-1992 245 new cases of asthma induced by diisocyanates were diagnosed, caused by hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) in 39%, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) in 39%, and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in 17% of the cases. Our aim was to study the clinical outcome of diisocyanate-induced asthma. A questionnaire was sent to the 235 patients alive in 1995, and validated by reexamining clinically 91 of them. The study was carried out on average 10 () yr after the diagnosis. Of the patients 82% experienced symptoms of asthma, 34% used no medication, and 35% were on regular medication. The patients having displayed immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to isocyanates used less medication (OR 0.273; CI 0.098, 0.758) and had fewer symptoms of asthma (OR 0.329; CI 0.124, 0.875) than the IgE-negative ones. They also had a significantly shorter duration of symptoms (p = 0.0025), latency period (p = 0.0249), and duration of exposure (p = 0.0008) than the IgE-negative patients. This did not, however, entirely explain the more favourable outcome of the IgE-positive patients. Patients with HDI-induced asthma used less medication (OR 0.412; CI 0.229, 0.739) than patients with MDI- and TDI-induced asthma. The results confirm the generally rather poor medical outcome of diisocyanate-induced asthma; the persistence of symptoms and unspecific bronchial reactivity were pronounced in TDI-induced asthma. A more favourable outcome was associated with IgE mediation and HDI inducement.
