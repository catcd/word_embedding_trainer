Five cases are presented with different types of cerebellar lesions which may be encountered in epileptics. Case 1 represents typical postical lesions, Case 2 perinatal anoxic-ischemic damage, Case 3 transneuronal degeneration causing crossed cerebellar atrophy, Case 4 iatrogenic cerebellar atrophy due to Phenytoin toxicity. Case 5 illustrates the interaction of two mechanisms, postictal lobular sclerosis and transneuronal degeneration. It is suggested that by attention to the type and distribution of the cerebellar lesions, to the clinical history and to the distribution of lesions in other parts of the brain the pathogenetic mechanisms can be elucidated in most cases.
The use of alkaloidal ("crack") cocaine in pregnancy can result in systemic and focal vasoconstriction and abnormal uterine contractions forceful enough to cause the complete rupture of a gravid uterus along a previous vertical cesarean section scar. A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain at 34 weeks' gestation. She had had a low vertical cesarean section 3 years previously for breech presentation with acute fetal distress at 28 weeks' gestation. The patient had a history of heavy "crack" abuse and admitted to inhaling "crack" throughout the day until 4 hours before admission. Within 15 minutes after presentation a laparotomy was performed, revealing an infant floating in the abdominal cavity. A live baby was promptly delivered, and the ruptured uterus was repaired. The patient was discharged 4 days post partum. "Crack" cocaine, through its known effects on the vasculature and contractility of the myometrium, likely facilitated the uterine rupture in this patient. The edges of the rupture wound were surprisingly clean, with little bleeding, perhaps owing to the drug's vasoconstrictive effects. It was therefore feasible to repair the uterus as an alternative approach to hysterectomy.
Plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) is a novel polyspecific organic cation transporter that transports organic cations and the purine nucleoside, adenosine. PMAT is expressed in the kidney, but the specific localization and function of this transporter in renal cells are unclear. In this study, we developed a polyclonal antibody toward a 14-amino acid sequence in the last intracellular loop of PMAT and determined the precise cellular localization of PMAT in human and rat kidneys. Surprisingly, we found that the PMAT protein was predominantly expressed in the glomerulus with minimal expression in tubular cells. Within the glomerulus, dual-color immunofluorescence labeling showed that the PMAT protein was specifically localized to the visceral glomerular epithelial cells, i.e., podocytes. There was no significant PMAT immunoreactivity in mesangial or glomerular endothelial cells. We further showed that puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN), a classic podocyte toxin that induces massive proteinuria and severe glomerulopathy, is transported by PMAT. Expression of PMAT in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells significantly increased cell sensitivity to PAN. Decynium 22, a potent PMAT inhibitor, abolished PAN toxicity in PMAT-expressing cells. Together, our data suggest that PMAT is specifically expressed in podocytes and may play an important role in PAN-induced kidney injury.
This study examined the incidence of side effects occurring with three doses of orally administered triazolam in children undergoing restorative dental procedures.
Thirty children, aged 39-81 months, participated in the study. The children were pretested for gait ataxia, amnesia, visual acuity, stereoscopic depth perception, and diplopia during a screening session. In a subsequent appointment, children received one of three triazolam dosages (0.005, 0.015, and 0.030 mg/kg) prior to dental treatment. Dosage assignment was random and double blind. Each child received a single triazolam dosage. Tests for gait ataxia, amnesia, and visual disturbances were repeated following drug administration.
The proportion of children experiencing ataxia, amnesia, and diplopia increased with increasing triazolam dosages. The 0.030-mg/kg triazolam dosage impaired visual acuity and stereoscopic depth perception.
Triazolam produces ataxia, amnesia, and diplopia in a dose-dependent manner in children.
MCP-1, which signals via the CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), is induced in lung fibrosis that is accompanied by mononuclear cell recruitment and activation of lung fibroblasts. To evaluate the role of CCR2 in lung fibrosis, CCR2 knockout (ko) mice were used in a model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Wild type (wt) and ko mice were injected endotracheally with bleomycin to induce lung injury and fibrosis, and then analyzed for degree of lung fibrosis and cytokine expression. The results showed significantly reduced fibrosis in ko mice as evidenced by decreased lung type I collagen gene expression and hydroxyproline content relative to those in wt mice. Lung TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 expression was significantly lower in ko vs. wt mice, while MCP-1 expression was unaffected. Interestingly, lung alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression, a marker for myofibroblast differentiation, was also decreased in ko mice, which was confirmed by analysis of isolated lung fibroblasts. Fibroblasts from ko mice exhibited decreased responsiveness to TGF-beta1 induced alpha-SMA expression, which was associated with reduced expression of TGF-beta receptor II (TbetaRII) and Smad3. These findings suggest that CCR2 signaling plays a key role in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by regulating fibrogenic cytokine expression and fibroblast responsiveness to TGF-beta.
A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates. Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/oxygen only. After premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of ketamine, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine proved safe and effective. Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate. Diazepam, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations. Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia. An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate. Experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.
In over 95% of women who have for some time taken estrogen preparations or oral contraceptives containing estrogens there is no significant rise in blood pressure. Probably no more than 1 to 2% of young women treated develop clinically significant hypertension. In very rare instances, the preparations may induce potentially fatal malignant hypertension. Old age, a family history of hypertension and toxemia during earlier pregnancies seem to be predisposing factors for estrogen hypertension. Guide lines are given for the supervision of blood pressure in daily medical practice and circulatory contraindications to the prescription of these preparations are suggested.
In this study we examined the role of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) in pulmonary susceptibility to ozone toxicity, utilizing GSH deficient C57BL/6J mice that lack the expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM). Gclm(-/-) knockout mice had 70% GSH depletion in the lung. Gclm(+/+) wild-type and Gclm(-/-) mice were exposed to either 0.3 ppm ozone or filtered air for 48h. Ozone-induced lung hyperpermeability, as measured by total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, was surprisingly lower in Gclm(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Lung hyperpermeability did not correlate with the degree of neutrophilia or with inflammatory gene expression. Pulmonary antioxidant response to ozone, assessed by increased mRNA levels of metallothionein 1 and 2, alpha-tocopherol transporter protein, and solute carrier family 23 member 2 (sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter) was greater in Gclm(-/-) mice than in Gclm(+/+) mice. These results suggest that compensatory augmentation of antioxidant defenses in Gclm(-/-) mice may confer increased resistance to ozone-induced lung injury.
A 57-year-old woman with a bipolar disorder presented with decreasing renal function caused by lithium-induced nephropathy.
To investigate the therapeutic effects of perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker on TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta receptor II mRNA, Smad3 and Smad7 on rat liver fibrosis.
60 Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (each group, n=15). Group 1 rats were not treated and served as healthy controls. The rats of groups 2,3,and 4 were injected with CCl(4) which induced liver fibrosis. After four weeks, group 3 rats started a treatment of perindopril, and group 4 rats with valsartan. All rats were sacrificed at the eighth week and their blood and livers were collected for analysis. The effects of perindopril and valsartan were evaluated by the levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFb1), and TGF receptor (TGFb1RII) mRNA in liver tissues by RT-PCR, the expressions and sites of TGFb1, Smad3 and Smad7 in liver tissue by immunohistochemical staining. The liver histopathology was also examined with HE staining, and the hydroxyproline in the liver and serum hyaluronic acid (HA) were examined using biochemsitry and RIA.
Compared with the control group, the levels of TGFb1, TGFb1RII mRNA and the expression Smad3 were significantly decreased in the two treated groups, and the expression of Smad7 was also remarkably increased in the livers of rats treated with perindopril or valsartan. The histological changes of fibrosis, the hydroxyproline in the livers and HA were also improved in the treated rats.
Perindopril and valsartan have a protective effect on liver injury and can inhibit hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl(4) in rats. Their mechanisms may be associated with their effects of down-regulating TGFb1, TGFb1RII mRNA and smad3, and up-regulating Smad7 which then resulted in suppressing the activation of hepatic stellate cells.
To find a new method of treating hepatocellular carcinoma with melittin by way of using the melittin gene.
The recombinant adenoviruses carrying the melittin gene and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) promoter (Ad-rAFP-Mel) were constructed through a bacterial homologous recombinant system. The efficiency of the adenovirus mediated gene transfer and the inhibition effect of Ad-rAFP-Mel on the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma cells were determined by X-gal staining and MTT assay respectively. The tumorigenicity of hepatocarcinoma cells transfected by Ad-rAFP-Mel and the antitumor effect of Ad-rAFP-Mel on the transplanted tumors in nude mice were detected in vivo.
The mRNA of the melittin gene was transcripted in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells transducted by Ad-rAFP-Mel. The efficiency of adenovirus mediated gene transfered to BEL-7402 hepatocarcinoma cells was 100% when the multiplicities of infection (MOI) of Ad-rAFP-Mel was 10 in vitro and was high in vivo as well. The inhibitive rates of Ad-rAFP-Mel and Ad-rAFP for BEL7402 cells were 66.2%+/-2.7% and 2.9%+/-2.3% (t = 30.83) by MTT assay. The inhibitive rates of Ad-CMV-Mel for BEL7402, SMMC7721 and L02 cells were 58.9%+/-9.6%, 65.9%+/-3.8%, 31.7%+/-1.2%, respectively, and those of the Ad-rAFP-Mel were 6.2%+/-2.7%, 16.1%+/-6.6%, 7.5%+/-3.3%, respectively (t = 1.27; t = 11.31, and t = 12.12, vs. Ad-CMV-Mel group in same cells). The tumorigenicity rates of hepatocarcinoma cells transfected by Ad-rAFP-Mel were decreased. A significant antineoplastic effect was detectd on transplanted tumor in nude mice by intratumoral injection of Ad-rAFP-Mel.
Ad-rAFP-Mel can inhibit specifically the proliferation of AFP-producing human hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. It suggests that animal toxin gene can be used as an interesting antitumor gene.
The effects of prolonged oral administration of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-isomers of benzene hexachloride (BHC) on rat liver were examined histologically. Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in the liver of rats fed a basal diet containing 1,500 or 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of alpha-BHC for 72 weeks. Many typical nodular hyperplasias developed in all groups given 1,500 or 1,000 ppm alpha-BHC. In non-neoplastic areas, slight oval cell infiltration and bile duct proliferation were seen. No neoplastic changes or other abnormal findings, such as oval cell infiltration, fatty changes, fibrosis, or bile duct proliferation of the liver, were observed in groups receiving 500 ppm alpha-, beta-, gamma-, or gamma-BHC.
We describe a case of a 57-year-old woman with repeated acute arterial thrombosis of the femoral arteries following intravenous carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy for metastatic ovarian carcinoma. By extensive workup, no other known causes of arterial thrombosis were found. To our knowledge, this is the first case describing arterial thrombosis occurring as a complication of carboplatin therapy.
The paper presents a female patient in whom the penicillamine therapy for aggressive hepatitis triggered off the development of nephrotic syndrome. Histological findings revealed membranous glomerulonephritis. After the withdrawal of penicillamine therapy, the laboratory results returned to normal. The authors concluded that penicillamine should only be administered in conditions in which other means of therapy prove inefficient (i.e. Wilson's disease, cystinuria associated with calculi).
Many diatom species produce polyunsaturated aldehydes, such as decadienal, which compromise embryonic and larval development in benthic organisms. Here newly fertilized Paracentrotus lividus sea urchins were exposed to low concentration of decadienal and the expression levels of sixteen genes, implicated in a broad range of functional responses, were followed by Real Time qPCR in order to identify potential decadienal targets. We show that at low decadienal concentrations the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus places in motion different classes of genes to defend itself against this toxic aldehyde, activating hsp60 and two proteases, hat and BP10, at the blastula stage and hsp56 and several other genes (14-3-3ε, p38 MAPK, MTase, and GS) at the prism stage. At this latter stage all genes involved in skeletogenesis (Nec, uni, SM50 and SM30) were also down-expressed, following developmental abnormalities that mainly affected skeleton morphogenesis. Moreover, sea urchin embryos treated with increasing concentrations of decadienal revealed a dose-dependent response of activated target genes. Finally, we suggest that this orchestrated defense system against decadienal represents part of the chemical defensome of P. lividus affording protection from environmental toxicants.
Degradation of the cysteinyl leukotrienes LTE4 and N-acetyl-LTE4, and of LTB4 by beta-oxidation from the omega-end has been recognized as an important pathway in the inactivation of these mediators. The contribution of peroxisomes to leukotriene degradation and inactivation was studied in isolated hepatocytes, in isolated liver peroxisomes, and in patients with inherited peroxisome deficiency. (1) Isolated hepatocytes from rats pretreated with the peroxisome proliferator clofibrate produced highly increased amounts of beta-oxidation products derived from omega-carboxy-LTB4 and omega-carboxy-N-acetyl-LTE4 as compared to normal hepatocytes. (2) Isolated peroxisomes purified from normal and clofibrate-treated liver produced omega-carboxy-dinor-LTB4 and omega-carboxy-tetranor-LTB3 when nucleotide cofactors, including CoA, ATP, NAD+, FAD, and NADPH, were added. beta-Oxidation of the cysteinyl leukotriene omega-carboxy-N-acetyl-LTE4 was observed only with isolated peroxisomes together with a microsome fraction providing an acyl-CoA synthetase activity. (3) Peroxisomal leukotriene-binding proteins were identified by photo-affinity labeling with omega-carboxy-[3H]leukotrienes and precipitation of labeled polypeptides with antibodies against enzymes of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system. (4) Peroxisomal degradation of leukotrienes in humans was studied by analyses of endogenous leukotrienes and their catabolites in urine from patients with an inherited peroxisomal deficiency disorder (Zellweger syndrome) and healthy infant controls. Urinary LTE4, relative to creatinine, was increased 10-fold in the patients, whereas the beta-oxidation product omega-carboxy-tetranor-LTE3 was only detectable in healthy infants. In addition, LTB4 was exclusively detected in the urine of patients with peroxisome deficiency. The increased levels of biologically active, proinflammatory mediators might be of pathophysiological significance. In addition, the altered pattern of leukotriene metabolites in urine may be of diagnostic value. The measurements in these patients underline the essential role of peroxisomes in the catabolism and inactivation of leukotrienes in humans.
High doses of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) have been used in the treatment of refractory forms of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and ANLL occurring after previous antineoplastic therapy. In addition to the usual toxicities associated with antimetabolites, neurotoxicity, mainly in the form of cerebellar dysfunction, develops in a significant proportion of patients receiving high-dose cytosine arabinoside HDara-C. This study was performed to determine the incidence of cerebellar dysfunction in our patients and to determine any factors that predict its development. In this series of 30 consecutive patients receiving HDara-C, confusion with cerebellar signs and symptoms developed in seven (23%). Factors that appear to predispose patients to the development of neurotoxicity are (1) past history of neurologic dysfunction and (2) preexisting and progressive hepatic dysfunction. No peripheral neuropathy was seen. In contrast to previous reports, we did not find neurotoxicity to be dose related. Prophylactic use of pyridoxine does not prevent neurotoxicity.
Patients with severe hypertension and/or congestive heart failure (n = 281) who were unresponsive to other therapies and intolerant to captopril received enalapril treatment (mean dose 19.5 mg/day) under study conditions as part of a Compassionate Use Program. Many of these patients had serious concurrent disorders known to predispose them to a greater risk of adverse experiences and death. The mean duration of enalapril treatment was 29 weeks, with a range of 1 day to approximately 3.5 years. Enalapril was generally well tolerated, and the estimated long term probability of patients terminating enalapril therapy because of adverse effects was low. 20 patients had discontinued captopril treatment because of low white blood cell counts; during subsequent enalapril treatment these reactions resolved in 14 patients, persisted in 2 patients, and could not be evaluated in 4 patients. Captopril-related proteinuria improved or resolved in 9 and persisted in 2 of 15 patients, taste disturbances resolved in 35 and persisted in 2 of 38 patients; and rash resolved in all but 7 of 178 patients during enalapril treatment. 18 patients (6%) discontinued enalapril treatment because of lack of efficacy; 6 of these 18 patients died due to a progression of heart failure, and another 11 patients died for other reasons. The deaths were considered unrelated to therapy with enalapril. Adverse reactions were the reason for discontinuation of enalapril treatment in 53 patients (19%). The most common adverse experiences that resulted in discontinuation of enalapril were: impairment of renal function (5%), hypotension (2%) and rash (2%). No neutropenia, proteinuria, or new taste disturbances were recorded as reasons for discontinuation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Two patients with acute myelomonocytic leukemia in central nervous system relapse developed clinical signs and computerized tomographic evidence of leukoencephalopathy five to seven days after intravenous high dose Ara-C therapy. The first patient had received 30 gm of intravenous Ara-C with cranial irradiation (1680 rad in 2 fractions) and intrathecal Ara-C (100 mg X twice) for an intracerebral chloroma and leptomeningeal leukemia. In this patient the leukoencephatlopathy was probably a result of a synergistic effect of the concomitant triple therapy. The second patient had received intrathecal administration of Ara-C and methotrexate for five and one-half months prior to intravenous Ara-C therapy. He developed altered mental status after 24 gm of intravenous Ara-C infusion. CT scan showed changes in the white matter compatible with leukoencephalopathy. In this patient the intravenous Ara-C probably was the precipitating factor of the development of leukoencephalopathy. The possible mechanism of the Ara-C induced leukoencephalopathy is discussed.
Epinephrine overdose induces many negative complications in adults because of its alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor activity. However, complications in newborns or children are rarely described. A 4-day-old, 2004-g female newborn was inadvertently given epinephrine at 100 times the usual dose; she developed hypokalemia and rhabdomyolysis. A nurse erroneously administered 2 mg of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/ml) into a peripheral intravenous line in the patient's right leg. Her potassium level decreased to 2.2 mEq/L. An infusion of potassium chloride 2 mEq/kg/day over 80 hours was required to correct the hypokalemia. Rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed and confirmed from laboratory results of an elevated creatine kinase level (peak 4124 U/L), with 100% creatine kinase-MM isoenzymes. No obvious long-term sequelae were observed. Effective ventilation, proper hydration, electrolyte maintenance, and early detection were assumed responsible for the positive outcome. Medication errors are common with pediatric inpatients, and efforts to reduce them are needed.
A 36-year-old woman was hospitalized for preoperative chemotherapy for osteosarcoma. She received intravenous fluids for 12 hours for volume expansion, then methotrexate 24 g (12 g/m2) over 6 hours. This was followed by intravenous leucovorin 200 mg over 1 hour. Two hours after the methotrexate infusion the patient developed chest pain and bradycardia. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus pauses, and telemetry recordings indicated a 4-beat run of ventricular tachycardia. A cardiac work-up consisting of cardiac enzyme level determination, two-dimensional echocardiography, and an adenosine technetium-99m tetrofosmin stress test was negative for structural and ischemic heart disease. The patient recovered without treatment and, approximately 2 weeks later, received a second course of methotrexate at half the dose without complication. One month later the patient received treatment with doxorubicin and cisplatin; 2 days later she died unexpectedly at home. Clinicians should be aware that high-dose methotrexate can cause cardiac symptoms and arrhythmias in previously healthy adults. This complication warrants attention and needs additional clinical investigation.
Administration of the non-metabolizable organic anion indocyanine green (ICG) prior to a toxic dose of acetaminophen (4-acetamidophenol; APAP) reduces liver injury 24h after dosing. ICG also produces a dose-dependent decrease in bile flow in mice and rats. Studies in bile duct-cannulated rats suggest that cholestasis can play a role in this protection. This study was conducted to determine if the ability of model organic anions to produce cholestasis is relevant to the protection against APAP hepatotoxicity afforded by ICG. In these studies, overnight fasted male CD-1 mice were dosed (i.v.) with the cholestatic dyes bromcresol green (BCG, 30 micromol/kg) and rose bengal (RB, 60 micromol/kg) immediately prior APAP administration (500 mg/kg, i.p.). Other groups of mice received the non-cholestatic dyes dibromosulphthalein (DBSP, 150 micromol/kg) and amaranth (AM, 300 micromol/kg) prior to APAP. Controls were given vehicle only. Hepatocellular necrosis was evident at 24 h in control mice receiving APAP. Pretreatment with the cholestatic dyes BCG and RB decreased the severity of hepatocellular necrosis induced by APAP. However, administration of the non-cholestatic dyes DBSP and AM did not alter APAP-induced liver damage. Glutathione replenishment was not altered by pretreatment with any of these dyes. Furthermore, ICG protected mice against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) hepatotoxicity. Since CCl4 undergoes minimal biliary excretion and does not compete for biliary transport function, this finding supports the notion that cholestasis itself rather than competition for canalicular transporters is central to the hepatoprotection by ICG and other cholephilic dyes.
Doxorubicin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents; however, it causes dose-dependent cardiomyopathy that may lead to heart failure. Conventional measures of ventricular function, such as fractional shortening, are insensitive in detecting early doxorubicin cardiomyopathy. We tested whether novel two-dimensional radial strain echocardiography (2DSE) can detect early doxorubicin injury following chronic administration in a rat model. 14 male Sprague Dawley rats (240 to 260 g) received doxorubicin 2.5 mg/k i.v. per wk for 10 (n=4) or 12 wk (n=10); 17 controls received saline (10 wk, n=7 and 12 wk, n=10). Serial 2DSE from 0 to 12 wk was done at the mid left ventricle using Vivid 7 echo (General Electric, Waukesha, WI, USA). With Q analysis software, radial strain was obtained. From the two-dimensional (2D) image, anatomical M-mode through the anterior/inferior walls was used to measure fractional shortening. Fibrosis (Masson's trichrome) and caspase-3 activity were measured from excised hearts. Radial strain was lower in the doxorubicin group (12 wk: 26.7+/-3 versus 38.3+/-2.6%, p=0.006), with significant difference by 8 wk whereas fractional shortening was lower with doxorubicin only after 12 wk (30.2+/-1.7 versus 37.6+/-1.4%, p=0.02). Doxorubicin group had lower cardiac mass (0.85+/-0.09 versus 1.14+/-0.04 g, p=0.001), higher caspase-3 activity (1.95+/-0.2 fold increase over control, p<0.0001) and fibrosis (3.9 +/- 0.7 versus 0.7+/-0.1%, p=0.005). Radial strain was related directly to cardiac mass (r=0.61, p=0.0007) and inversely to caspase-3 activity (r= -0.5, p=0.005). 2-dimensional radial strain echocardiography is useful in the early detection of doxorubicin cardiac injury and the reduction in radial strain is associated with histologic markers of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy.
Anaesthesia for elective direct current cardioversion (DCC) was induced with propofol (Diprivan) 1.2 mg/kg in 28 patients and with 0.2 mg/kg etomidate (Hypnomidate) in 20 patients. These mostly high risk patients (NYHA class II to III) were successfully treated with defibrillation. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before and after induction and at 2 minutes intervals up to 20 minutes after DCC. Both anaesthetic agents caused mild hypotension. Heart rate did not change significantly after induction but fell significantly after DCC from the mean value of 124 +/- 26 bpm and 122 +/- 37 bpm to 94 +/- 19 bpm and to 91 +/- 19 bpm in propofol and etomidate treated patients respectively. Four patients became apnoeic necessitating assisted ventilation for approximately four minutes. All propofol treated patients had rapid recovery times and opened eyes on command within 5.6 +/- 1.9 minutes after induction, and were fully orientated about 4 minutes later also. Complete amnesia was observed in all patients in this group. In contrast etomidate induced anaesthesia did not cause respiratory depression, but the recovery time was longer. Four patients of this group complained of recall of DCC. In 7 patients due to involuntary movements or myoclonus, after induction with etomidate reliable EKG monitoring appeared to be difficult.
Proliferation and differentiation of the normal endometrium are orderly regulated by female sex steroid hormones. In this connection, development and growth of endometrial cancer have also thought to be controlled in part by sex steroid hormones. Furthermore, some of the sex steroid hormones, progesterone, for example, are used as therapeutic agents in the management of endometrial cancer. The role of estrogen as a promotion factor of endometrial cancer is understood by unopposed estrogen hypothesis, and relative excess of estrogen unopposed by gestagen is regarded as an important factor for the development of endometrial cancer. High dose administration of gestagen has been used as a therapeutic agent of endometrial cancer over these three decades, and now the oral administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is mainstay, with response rate of approximately 30%. However, recently some cases with serious side effect, mainly thrombosis, have been reported. These cases should be regarded as a grave warning to easy usage of MPA. Therefore, the search for more effective and safe way for clinical application have to be requested; for example, clarification of the precise mechanism of anti-tumor effect of MPA on endometrial cancer or development of new hormonal therapeutic agents. Moreover, basic research in the field of cancer and hormone may create a new era in cancer therapy in the future.
Abnormalities of the p53 gene are known to confer detrimental effects in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and are associated with short survival. We have used high dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) to treat 25 patients with advanced refractory CLL of whom 45% had p53 abnormalities shown by one or more methods: flow cytometry, fluorescent in situ hybridisation and direct DNA sequencing. Fifteen were resistant to fludarabine and 16 were non-responders to their most recent therapy. Methylprednisolone had a cytotoxic effect on lymphocytes from 95% of cases assessed by an ex vivo apoptotic drug sensitivity index (DSI). HDMP was given alone or in combination with other drugs: vincristine, CCNU, Ara-C, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and chlorambucil, according to the results of DSI. Three patients were treated twice and each treatment was analysed separately. The overall response rate was 77% with a median duration of 12 months (range 7 -23+). Responders included 5/10 with abnormal p53, of which two achieved nodular PR. Patients with p53 abnormalities fared worse than those with normal p53. There were no differences in response according to whether HDMP was used alone or in combination. Nine of the 22 evaluable patients (3 NR and 6 PR) have died from progressive disease or transformation. Main toxicity was infection in 7/25 patients. Event free and overall survival were significantly better in responders vs non-responders ( P>0.0001 and P=0.04 respectively). Patients with a DSI of 100% to steroids had a better overall and event free survival, but this was not statistically significant. This study demonstrates that HDMP alone or in combination with other agents is a useful treatment strategy in refractory CLL including patients with p53 abnormalities.
The short-term hemodynamic and possible arrhythmogenic effects of intravenous salbutamol at a dose of 30 or 60 micrograms/min were evaluated in 14 patients with severe chronic left ventricular dysfunction using equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography and electrocardiographic monitoring. Salbutamol infusions at a dose of 30 micrograms/min did not cause significant hemodynamic changes; however, at a dose of 60 micrograms/min there was a significant increase in stroke volume, cardiac output, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart rate increased significantly while systemic peripheral resistance decreased significantly. Two patients developed ventricular premature beats and another two supraventricular tachycardia, but none were associated with adverse consequences. Thus, high-dose intravenous salbutamol is effective and safe, and may be used in the acute management of patients with poor left ventricular function.
