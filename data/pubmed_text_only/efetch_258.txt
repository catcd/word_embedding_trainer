The multiple-dose tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of tolcapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, were assessed in healthy elderly volunteers receiving concomitant carbidopa and levodopa.
Thirty-six volunteers from 55 to 75 years old participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending multiple-dose study. Tolcapone was studied at dosages of 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg three times daily (t.i.d.) in four sequential groups. Each group consisted of nine participants who had been randomized to receive either placebo (n = 3) or tolcapone (n = 6). Tolcapone or placebo was coadministered with carbidopa and levodopa (25 and 100 mg, respectively) for 7 days. Assessments included tolerability, pharmacokinetics of tolcapone, levodopa, and 3-O-methyldopa, and inhibition of COMT activity in erythrocytes.
By inhibiting COMT, tolcapone reduced levodopa metabolism to 3-O-methyldopa, resulting in a twofold increase in levodopa exposure (area under the curve) and elimination half-life, without changing levodopa peak plasma concentration. These effects were similar on days 1 and 7 of treatment. Development of tolerance to COMT inhibition was not observed. Onset of effect was rapid (day 1 of treatment), and the maximum effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics was already observed with 100 or 200 mg tolcapone t.i.d. At these dosages, tolcapone pharmacokinetics were linear and stable; accumulation occurred with 800 mg t.i.d. The combination of tolcapone and carbidopa-levodopa was generally well tolerated, although more nausea and vomiting were observed at higher dosages (400 to 800 mg t.i.d.), particularly in women.
Tolcapone shows promise as an effective adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Clinical pharmacology data indicate that the therapeutic regimen should be 100 or 200 mg t.i.d.
Determination of the thermal nociceptive threshold in the rat hind paw was used to investigate the participation of postganglionic sympathetic neurons and of capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons to bradykinin-induced thermal hyperaesthesia. Intraplantar injection of 0.5 microgram bradykinin or of 0.3 microgram prostaglandin E2 significantly lowered paw withdrawal latencies, whereas injection of [des-Arg9]bradykinin was ineffective. The B-2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 (0.1 mg/kg) prevented bradykinin- but not prostaglandin E2-induced thermal hyperaesthesia. While morphine (1 mg/kg) antagonized the effect of bradykinin and prostaglandin E2, indomethacin (10 mg/kg) reduced only bradykinin-induced sensitization. Although this can be taken as indication that bradykinin-induced sensitization of heat-sensitive fibres is mainly mediated via local prostanoid formation, we failed to obtain evidence for an involvement of sympathetic postganglionic fibres in this process: chemical sympathectomy, which lowered the tissue concentration of noradrenaline by more than 90%, did not influence the ability of bradykinin to induce a decrease in thermal nociceptive threshold. The target of bradykinin/prostaglandin E2 action seemed to be capsaicin-sensitive afferents, since in rats which had been treated with capsaicin to destroy this group of afferents, both substances were completely ineffective in producing sensitization. We suggest therefore that in the rat paw, bradykinin, independently from sympathetic postganglionic neurons, lowers the thermal nociceptive threshold mainly via B-2 receptor-mediated formation of cyclo-oxygenase products which, in turn, act exclusively on capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons.
Primary microcephaly can be accompanied by numerous migration anomalies. This experiment was undertaken to examine the pathogenesis of gray matter heterotopia and microcephaly that is produced after administering cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) to mice. Pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected with Ara-C at 30 mg/kg body weight on days 13.5 and 14.5 of gestation, and then their offspring were examined. On embryonic day 15.5, in the ventricular zone of the cingulate cortex, the neuroepithelial cells lacked BrdU immunoreactivity. Nestin-immunoreactive radial glial fibers and calretinin-positive subplate fibers were disrupted. TUNEL reaction was remarkable throughout the cerebral hemisphere. Subcortical heterotopia in the cingulate cortex and subependymal nodular heterotopia in the dorsolateral part of the lateral ventricles became detectable by the first day after birth. Thirty-two days after birth, microcephaly was apparent; subcortical heterotopia was observed to have increased in size while it was still located in the frontal and cingulate cortices. This experiment demonstrated that Ara-C induces neuronal apoptosis throughout the cerebral hemisphere. The immunohistochemical characteristics in the gray matter heterotopia suggest that both the subcortical and the subependymal heterotopias were formed by neurons originally committed to the neocortex. We conclude that the gray matter heterotopia that accompanies the microcephaly was produced by a disturbance of radial, tangential, and interkinetic neuronal migrations due to the toxicity of Ara-C in the immature developing brain.
Cultured cells of rat bladder transitional cell carcinoma line AY-27, in suspension, were assayed for galactosyl transferase (GT) by measurement of the transfer of [3H]galactose from uridine diphosphate-[3H]galactose to desialylated ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM-NANA). The assay was optimized with respect to time and to protein, uridine diphosphate galactose, OSM-NANA and Triton X-100 concentrations. This assay was then applied weekly to suspensions of exfoliated bladder cells collected from urines of rats fed the bladder carcinogen N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide, and of control rats. Increases in activity over controls appeared 42 weeks after feeding the carcinogen, at a stage when bladder tumors were already microinvasive or deeply invasive, and activities at 52 weeks were about 10-fold greater than normal values. In contrast, a bladder cytotoxic agent inducing reversible hyperplasia was injected into rats, and exfoliated cells were collected from urines: these cells showed no greater GT activity than normal. Bladder tumor tissue from a transplanted tumor had the same high specific enzymatic GT activity as exfoliated cells from tumor-bearing rats.
In search of genetic determinants of susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy, we examined the association between DNA sequence differences at the locus of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and renal complications in 151 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients with a diabetes duration of 16-21 years. This nested case-control study included 77 normoalbuminuric control subjects (albumin excretion rate < 30 micrograms/min) and 74 cases with evidence of nephropathy ranging from microalbuminuria to overt proteinuria. DNA from each of these patients was genotyped at the ACE locus by a three-allele restriction fragment-melting polymorphism (RFMP) (Dde I), which we described recently, and a two-allele insertion/deletion recognized as an Xba I restriction fragment-length polymorphism, which has been shown by other investigators to be associated with serum levels of ACE and with risk of myocardial infarction. The least common allele of the Dde I RFMP was significantly more frequent among cases with nephropathy than among normoalbuminuric control subjects (12.8 vs. 4.5%, P < 0.05). The deletion in the ACE gene was also more frequent in case than in control subjects (56.1 vs. 47.4%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P < 0.25) with this sample size. To determine the independence of these associations, the two polymorphisms were analyzed jointly to identify Xba I/Dde I haplotypes. As might be expected, carriers of the Xba I/Dde I '+ =' haplotype had a fourfold risk of developing diabetic nephropathy (odds ratio [OR] 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-11.0). However, this did not explain all of the excess Xba I '+' allele among cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To test potential protection by ICRF-187 against cumulative doxorubicin-dose-related cardiac toxicity, we conducted a randomized clinical trial in 150 women with advanced breast cancer.
Patients received fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 every 21 days intravenously (IV) (control regimen, 74 patients), or the same regimen preceded by ICRF-187 1,000 mg/m2 IV (experimental regimen, 76 patients).
We previously reported that ICRF-187 in this dose and schedule provides cardiac protection and does not substantially alter the noncardiac toxicity or antitumor efficacy of the control regimen. In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort, we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles (median, 11) and higher cumulative doses (median, 500 mg/m2) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group (median, nine cycles, P less than .01; and 441 mg/m2, P less than .05). Twenty-six patients in the ICRF-187 group received doxorubicin doses of at least 700 mg/m2, and among them, 11 patients received 1,000 mg/m2 or more. Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure (CHF; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group; P less than .0001) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) determined by multigated radionuclide (MUGA) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study (five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group; P less than .000001). Among the 30 patients who had an assessable endomyocardial biopsy at cumulative doxorubicin 450 mg/m2, none of 16 in the ICRF-187 group and six of 14 in the control group had a score of 2 (P less than .05). ICRF-187 cardiac protection was observed in patients with and without prior chest-wall radiation or other risk factors for developing doxorubicin cardiac toxicity.
By protecting against cumulative doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity, ICRF-187 permits significantly greater doses of doxorubicin to be administered to patients with greater safety.
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a recent addition to the family of natriuretic peptides including atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (ANP, BNP), is believed to be an endothelium-derived vasodilator and to have an antimitotic effect. ANP and BNP concentrations are increased in conditions such as congestive heart failure, but cardiac CNP concentrations have not been investigated in this connection. Diabetes mellitus also involves myocardial dysfunctions without coronary artery disease or systemic hypertension. We therefore investigated the cardiac expression of CNP mRNA compared with that of BNP mRNA in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. STZ- diabetic male Wistar rats (n=6) were studied in comparison with controls (n=6). The animals were characterised by their mean arterial blood pressure and plasma glucose concentrations. After extraction of total cardiac RNA, a specific cDNA probe of BNP was used for northern blot analysis, whereas myocardial CNP expression was analysed by an RNase-protection assay. Twelve weeks after diabetes was induced, the rats were normotensive (96.4+/-2.0 compared with 95.1+/-1.9 mmHg) and hyperglycaemic (615+/-61 compared with 165+/-21 mg/dl; P<0.001). Left ventricular pressure was significantly impaired (76.8+/-6.4 compared with 51.2+/-3.6 mmHg). STZ-diabetic rats had a 3.2-fold increase in cardiac BNP expression compared with controls. In contrast, cardiac CNP mRNA concentrations were decreased 2.6-fold. CNP seems to be downregulated like other peptides with antimitotic and vasodilator activities (nitric oxide, prostacyclin, kinins). This may contribute to cardiac dysfunction in diabetes mellitus and suggests that stimulation of CNP expression could provide cardiac protection in such cases.
Recently, it has been found that inappropriate expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is strongly associated with carcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of miRNAs (miRs) -143 and -145, the levels of which were previously shown to be reduced in colon cancers and various kinds of established cancer cell lines, was also decreased in most of the B-cell malignancies examined, including chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), B-cell lymphomas, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell lines, and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. All samples from 13 CLL patients and eight of nine B-cell lymphoma ones tested exhibited an extremely low expression of miRs-143 and -145. The expression levels of miRs-143 and -145 were consistently low in human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and were inversely associated with the cell proliferation observed in the EBV-transformed B-cell lines. Moreover, the introduction of either precursor or mature miR-143 and -145 into Raji cells resulted in a significant growth inhibition that occurred in a dose-dependent manner and the target gene of miRNA-143 was determined to be ERK5, as previously reported in human colon cancer DLD-1 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that miRs-143 and -145 may be useful as biomarkers that differentiate B-cell malignant cells from normal cells and contribute to carcinogenesis in B-cell malignancies by a newly defined mechanism.
This report documents the occurrence of torsades de pointes (TdP) caused by marked QT interval prolongation in the case of a 71-year-old woman receiving both metronidazole and amiodarone for the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The case highlights a previously unknown drug interaction. The role of inhibition of cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 is discussed.
Amont 338 women treated in Massachusetts with isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide = INH) for pulmonary tuberculosis, no excess cancer deaths occurred (8 observed vs 8.3 expected) after 23 years (12.9 mean) of follow-up. There was an excess of cancer deaths (54 vs 35.7) among 1,090 patients who did not receive INH, partly due to radiogenic breast cancer resulting from multiple chest fluoroscopies to monitor pneumothorax. Increased deaths from liver cirrhosis (5 vs 0.8) were observed following INH use, suggesting that chronic as well as acute liver disease complicate this treatment.
A multicenter, controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy, suggesting that other mechanism(s) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy (diabetic nephropathy). We have previously demonstrated that endothelial-mesenchymal-transition (EndoMT) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. In the present study, we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy.
EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line (MMEC) in the presence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and in the endothelial lineage-traceble mouse line Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP by administration of AGEs, with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control. Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and confocal microscopy. Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 (SIS3) were performed in MMECs and in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice.
Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice. Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy. Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT, reduced renal fibrosis, and retarded progression of nephropathy.
EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy. Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications.
Metastatic melanoma is difficult to treat because of low response rates to most chemotherapy regimens and short remission durations. Recently, a new chemohormonal regimen containing BCNU, cisplatin, DTIC and tamoxifen (BCDT) has been reported to be more promising. We have treated eight patients with this regimen and five patients responded, including three with complete responses (CR). One of these patients remains in CR beyond two years. Others have also reported response rates of 50% with this regimen with a few long-term remissions also. Two of our patients developed deep venous thromboses (DVT). The increased incidence of DVT with BCDT is attributed to the tamoxifen, which nevertheless appears to be a necessary component of this regimen. In two of our patients, short courses of tamoxifen were used and they both obtained responses (one CR, one PR) without DVT. The possibility of using short-course tamoxifen to reduce the incidence of DVT in this regimen, without impairing its efficacy, should be investigated.
To determine whether endogenous opioids play a role in modulating the appreciation of chest pain in angina pectoris, the specific opioid antagonist, Naloxone, was used. The hypothesis was that the appearance time of ischemic myocardial pain should decrease after Naloxone if centrally mediated pain perception is significantly influenced by the endorphin system in angina pectoris. A randomized double blind clinical trial was conducted in 5 men with effort-induced angina pectoris associated with ST segment changes. Three multi-stage exercise tests, using the Bruce protocol were performed on the same day and time, on three successive weeks. Chest pain was reported 4.3 +/- 0.3 (SEM) minutes after starting exercise on the first or baseline test. On subsequent tests patients received either Naloxone 2 mg IV or a similar volume of saline placebo. Angina pectoris occurred significantly (p. less than 0.05) earlier (1.6 +/- 0.2 minutes) after Naloxone compared to placebo. There were no significant differences in myocardial ischemia indicated by ST segment changes and no significant differences in resting or exercise blood pressure and heart rate between Naloxone and placebo. Thus, these data focus attention on a neglected area of myocardial ischemic pain and suggest that endogenous opioids play a significant role in the recognition of the pain of effort-related angina pectoris.
Cataplexy in the narcoleptic canine has been shown to increase after systemic administration of cholinergic agonists. Furthermore, the number of cholinergic receptors in the pontine reticular formation of narcoleptic canines is significantly elevated. In the present study we have investigated the effects of cholinergic drugs administered directly into the pontine reticular formation on cataplexy, as defined by brief episodes of hypotonia induced by emotions, in narcoleptic canines. Carbachol and atropine were perfused through microdialysis probes implanted bilaterally in the pontine reticular formation of freely moving, narcoleptic and control Doberman pinschers. Cataplexy was quantified using the Food-Elicited Cataplexy Test, and analysed using recordings of electroencephalogram, electrooculogram and electromyogram. Cataplexy was characterized by a desynchronized electroencephalogram and a drop in electromyogram and electrooculogram activity. In narcoleptic canines, both unilateral and bilateral carbachol (10(-5) to 10(-3) M) produced a dose-dependent increase in cataplexy, which resulted in complete muscle tone suppression at the highest concentration. In control canines, neither bilateral nor unilateral carbachol (10(-5) to 10(-3) M) produced cataplexy, although bilateral carbachol, did produce muscle atonia at the highest dose (10(-3)). The increase in cataplexy after bilateral carbachol (10(-4) M) was rapidly reversed when the perfusion medium was switched to one containing atropine (10(-4) M). Bilateral atropine (10(-3) to 10(-2) M) alone did not produce any significant effects on cataplexy in narcoleptic canines; however, bilateral atropine (10(-2) M) did reduce the increase in cataplexy produced by systemic administration of physostigmine (0.05 mg/kg, i.v.). These findings demonstrate that cataplexy in narcoleptic canines can be stimulated by applying cholinergic agonists directly into the pontine reticular formation. The ability of atropine to inhibit locally and systemically stimulated cataplexy indicates that the pontine reticular formation is a critical component in cholinergic stimulation of cataplexy. Therefore, it is suggested that the pontine reticular formation plays a significant role in the cholinergic regulation of narcolepsy.
A case of severe acute hepatitis caused by cyproterone acetate in a 71 year old man with prostatic carcinoma is reported with a review of the literature on hepatic reactions to this drug. The association between the use of cyproterone acetate and liver abnormalities is poorly documented. This is the fourth published report of adverse hepatic reaction to cyproterone acetate and it substantiates other evidence that cyproterone acetate is potentially hepatotoxic. Monitoring of liver function tests should be mandatory in patients receiving high doses of cyproterone acetate; the drug should be withdrawn immediately if abnormal liver function tests are found.
Although acute hepatitis may be a side effect of many medications, most cases are reversible after treatment interruption, and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is rare. Venlafaxine and trazodone are 2 popular antidepressant agents. Alteration of liver enzyme levels has been reported as a side effect of these drugs at normal doses. Herein we have reported the case of a 48-year-old woman without any previous history of liver disease, who developed fulminant liver failure after 4 months of venlafaxine and trazodone therapy. She required liver transplantation, a procedure that was successful with full patient recovery. The first 5 years of follow-up were uneventful. This case documented that venlafaxine and trazodone at normal doses can produce severe liver toxicity. Liver tests should be monitored regularly in patients who receive this therapy.
Extracellular modulators of cell-cell signaling control numerous aspects of organismal development. The Twisted gastrulation (Twsg1) gene product is a small, secreted cysteine-rich protein that has the unusual property of being able to either enhance or inhibit signaling by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) subfamily of TGF-beta type factors in a context-dependent manner. In this report, we characterize the early embryonic and skeletal phenotypes associated with loss of Twsg1 function in mice. All Twsg1 mutant mice, irrespective of genetic background, exhibit deletions of neural arches in the cervical vertebrae. In a C57BL/6 background, we also observe pronounced forebrain defects including rostral truncations, holoprosencephaly, cyclopia, as well as alterations in the first branchial arch (BA1) leading to lack of jaw (agnathia). Characterization of marker expression suggests that these defects are attributable to loss of signaling from forebrain-organizing centers including Fgf8 from the anterior neural ridge (ANR) and Shh from the prechordal plate (PrCP). In addition, we find defects in the foregut endoderm and a reduction in Hex expression, which may contribute to both the forebrain and BA1 defects.
This survey was carried out on a horse farm in order to acquire recent data on macrocyclic lactone-resistant Parascaris equorum which had been previously detected on this farm and to determine efficacies of ivermectin and pyrantel against strongyles in order to determine whether a resistance problem also exists in these parasites. In the first part of the study, abamectin was given to horses infected with P. equorum. In 11 out of 12 horses, zero efficacy (0%) was seen against P. equorum. Subsequently, horses which were Parascaris-positive after abamectin treatment received pyrantel pamoate and its efficacy was 0-80% in 3 animals and 96-100% 8. The remained Parascaris-infected horses were treated again with a double dose of pyrantel and it was fully effective in all horses. In the second part of the study, efficacy of ivermectin and pyrantel against strongyles infections was assessed 14 and 28 days after treatment and an efficacy of 100% was detected on both days. In conclusion, macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics were found to be non-efficacious against P. equorum whereas pyrantel at the double dose rate was effective against these resistant worms. Resistance to ivermectin or pyrantel was not detected in strongyles.
In coronary arteries, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy, a known risk factor for coronary heart disease) impairs flow-induced dilations, which can be reversed by superoxide dismutase (SOD). To evidence increased O2*- generation and elucidate its source, we characterized changes in activity (lucigenin chemiluminescence, hydroethidine staining) and expression of arterial pro- and antioxidant systems (Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, cDNA microarray, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) in the coronary arteries of rats by using methionine diet-induced HHcy.
The increased generation of O2*- by HHcy coronary arteries was inhibited by SOD, diphenyleneiodonium, apocynin, and apocynin plus amino guanidine but was unaffected by allopurinol and rotenone. Also, diphenyleneiodonium-sensitive NADPH-driven O2*- generation was increased in HHcy vessels. In HHcy arteries expression of the smooth muscle-confined NAD(P)H oxidase subunit nox1 and that of iNOS was increased. Expression of p67phox, p22phox, and p47phox subunits and that of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, Cu,Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, extracellular SOD (mRNA), and xanthine oxidase was unchanged. Microarray analysis showed increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry) that was localized in smooth muscle. In vitro incubation (18 hours) of HHcy arteries with anti-TNF-alpha antibody decreased O2*- production, whereas incubation of control vessels with TNF-alpha increased O2*- generation and nox1 expression.
In coronary arteries, HHcy increases TNF-alpha expression, which enhances oxidative stress through upregulating a nox1-based NAD(P)H oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Thus, TNF-alpha induces a proinflammatory vascular phenotype in HHcy that potentially contributes to the development of coronary atherosclerosis.
The factors determining disease severity in malaria are complex and include host polymorphisms, acquired immunity and parasite virulence. Studies in Africa have shown that severe malaria is associated with the ability of erythrocytes infected with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum to bind uninfected erythrocytes and form rosettes. The molecular basis of resetting is not well understood, although a group of low-molecular-mass proteins called rosettins have been described as potential parasite ligands. Infected erythrocytes also bind to endothelial cells, and this interaction is mediated by the parasite-derived variant erythrocyte membrane protein PfEMP1, which is encoded by the var gene family. Here we report that the parasite ligand for rosetting in a P. falciparum clone is PfEMP1, encoded by a specific var gene. We also report that complement-receptor 1 (CR1) on erythrocytes plays a role in the formation of rosettes and that erythrocytes with a common African CR1 polymorphism (S1(a-)) have reduced adhesion to the domain of PfEMP1 that binds normal erythrocytes. Thus we describe a new adhesive function for PfEMP1 and raise the possibility that CR1 polymorphisms in Africans that influence the interaction between erythrocytes and PfEMP1 may protect against severe malaria.
1. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of preventive and curative isosorbide-5-mononitrate (Is-5-Mn) treatment on the development of hypertension, cGMP content, thromboxane (TX) A(2)/prostaglandin (PG) I2 balance, the peripheral serotonergic system, platelet activation, lipid peroxidation and plasma lipids in cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced hypertensive rats. 2. Control, CsA (5 mg/kg per day) and Is-5-Mn (150 mg/kg per day, b.i.d.) rat groups were treated orally over a period of 7 weeks. The preventive Is-5-Mn group (Is-5-Mn + CsA) was first treated for 2 weeks with Is-5-Mn, followed by 7 weeks with both drugs; the curative Is-5-Mn group (CsA + Is-5-Mn) was treated for a period of 7 weeks with CsA and with both drugs for an additional 5 weeks. The control group received oral vehicle. 3. Whereas in the group undergoing preventive treatment the CsA-induced increase in blood pressure (BP), compared with the control group, was avoided, in the group undergoing curative treatment, the increase in BP was even higher. The decreased arterial cGMP content in the CsA group was prevented and reverted when Is-Mn was administered either preventatively or curatively with CsA. Platelet TXA2 production, although unaffected in the Is-5-Mn + CsA group, was significantly higher in the CsA + Is-5-Mn group compared with the group receiving CsA alone. Furthermore, plasma TXA2 was reduced following preventive Is-5-Mn treatment, but was worsened in the group undergoing curative therapy. Aortic PGI2 synthesis was identical in all groups. Consequently, the TXA2/PGI2 ratio was only altered in the CsA + Is-5-Mn group, demonstrating a markedly higher value. In both groups treated simultaneously with CsA and Is-5-Mn, a higher platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) content was obtained compared with CsA treatment alone, but only preventive treatment with Is-5-Mn resulted in a significant reduction in plasma 5-HT. Changes in ADP and collagen-induced platelet aggregation paralleled those of plasma 5-HT and TXA2: the hyperaggregation profile of the CsA group, although partially prevented, was not reverted by simultaneous treatment with Is-5-Mn and CsA. Lipid peroxidation and lipid profile values also worsened in the CsA + Is-5-Mn group compared with the group administered CsA alone. 4. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of concomitant Is-5-Mn and CsA treatment were demonstrated when Is-5-Mn was administered preventatively because not only was arterial hypertension prevented, but platelet aggregation and plasma TXA2 and 5-HT levels were also reduced. In contrast, following curative treatment, the BP, platelet/vascular vasoconstrictor balance, lipid peroxidation and plasma lipids were aggravated, recommending a judicious evaluation of the impact of nitrate therapy throughout the period of its administration.
Thirteen patients with up to two-week-old phlebothromboses were treated with streptokinase and human plasminogen according to a fixed dosage scheme. In six cases reopening of the vein was complete, in three cases partially complete. In four cases thrombolysis had to be stopped due to macrohaematuria. Haemorrhagic complications occurred mainly after the third day of treatment. Substitution of human plasminogen during continuous streptokinase administration is, in the case of demonstrable lowering of the plasma plasminogen level, a valuable addition to the thrombolytic concept.
Paclitaxel (Taxol) is a novel antineoplastic agent that acts by promoting microtubule polymerization. Although myelosuppression and peripheral neurotoxicity are well known and dose limiting, there have been no reports of CNS toxicity apart from two patients with seizures. This may reflect that paclitaxel has little or no blood-brain barrier penetration. We report two women treated with paclitaxel who developed a clinical state characterized by confusion, word-finding difficulty, and behavioral changes. One had bilateral extensor plantar responses. These symptoms appeared 1 week after paclitaxel infusion and resolved spontaneously. Subsequent infusions were associated with a similar self-resolving encephalopathy in one patient and recurrent headache and ataxia in the other. Neuroimaging (including enhanced MRI), LP, and laboratory investigations did not reveal other causes. Electroencephalography showed diffuse nonspecific slowing. One MRI had prominent but nonspecific high signal intensity abnormalities in the deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Based on temporal association, diagnostic exclusion, and repeated episodes with subsequent challenges, we believe these patients may have experienced CNS toxicity from paclitaxel. The mechanism for this self-resolving encephalopathic process is unclear.
Doxorubicin participates in a wide range of free radical reactions. The drug can undergo one electron reduction to the corresponding semiquinone, leading the generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, the drug causes the disappearance of cardiac glutathione peroxidase, leaving the heart with no means of disposing of the hydrogen peroxide thus generated. Doxorubicin also is a powerful iron chelator and the resultant iron-drug complex is an efficient catalyst of the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Without the drug-iron complex, little or no cardiac production of hydroxyl radical occurs and heart damage does not occur.
Seizures have been shown to regulate neurotrophin expression in adult mammalian brain. However, there has been some controversy as to whether seizures affect neurotrophin expression in very immature brain. In the present study, we have examined the effects of seizures induced by pilocarpine following lithium pretreatment or by kainic acid on the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in developing rat brain by in situ hybridization. In adult brain, lithium/pilocarpine treatment resulted in dramatic elevations of hybridization to BDNF cRNA in neocortical and limbic brain structures. In developing brain, lithium/pilocarpine induced elevations of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus, piriform and entorhinal cortex as early as postnatal day 7 (P7). By P12, the pattern of enhanced expression was similar to that of the adult. Maximal elevations of hybridization were present 2 to 4 h following pilocarpine injection. Electrophysiological recording demonstrated that lithium/pilocarpine treatment resulted in electrographic seizures. Pretreatment with diazepam blocked the seizures as well as the elevation of BDNF mRNA. Kainic acid induced elevations of BDNF mRNA in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer, but not in other brain areas in pups as young as P7. These data indicate that seizures during the neonatal and early juvenile period of brain development induce elevated BDNF mRNA expression, and that different methods of seizure induction yield different patterns of elevations in hybridization. Furthermore, BDNF may be capable of playing a role in the development of seizure susceptibility in the immature brain.
