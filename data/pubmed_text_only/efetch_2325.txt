Blindness as a result of steroid injection into areas adjacent to the eyes, namely the interior of the nose and eyelids, has been described in the otolaryngologic and ophthalmologic literature but at no time in the plastic surgery literature. We describe a case of permanent visual loss at the time of injection of a long-acting steroid to the dorsum of the nose for postrhinoplasty scarring. We suggest that before steroid injection for elective procedures, the patient be informed of all possible consequences of complications even if their occurrence is very rare.
N-Acetylprocainamide (NAPA) accumulated in the plasma of 6 cardiac patients with renal failure taking procainamide chronically for therapy (4 were undergoing hemodialysis) and contributed to the therapeutic and toxic effects of the procainamide. NAPA plasma levels ranged from 14.0 to 28.0 microgram/ml 3 hr after a dose of procainamide which is well above the 3-hr NAPA plasma levels of nonazotemic cardiac patients (range 1.9 to 6.3 microgram/ml; p = 0.002) on larger doses of procainamide. There was almost no decline in NAPA plasma levels on interdialysis days. In one of the patients with renal failure NAPA was still present 15 days (13.8 microgram/ml) and 38 days (0.9 microgram/ml) after procainamide was stopped, indicating a half-life of several days. Measurement of procainamide plasma concentrations by the usual fluorometric or colorimetric methods does not detect NAPA. Since NAPA accumulates in patients with impaired renal function, the concentrations of both this active metabolite and procainamide should be determined in these patients if drug level monitoring is to be helpful.
Dapsone (DDS) (4,4'diaminodiphenylsulfone), the drug of choice for the treatment of leprosy, frequently induces haemolytic anaemia and methaemoglobinaemia. N-hydroxylation, one of the major pathways of biotransformation, has been constantly related to the methaemoglobinaemia observed with the use of the drug. In order to determine the reversible inhibition of this toxicologic bioactivation pathway without changing the detoxification pathways of the drug or cytosolic acetylation, cimetidine (CIM), ranitidine and famotidine were administered in combination with DDS to male Wistar rats weighing 200-220 g. The animals were divided into nine groups of eight: group 1 received a single dose of 40 mg kg (-1) DDS in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and groups 2-4 received the same treatment as group 1 but after the administration of a single dose of 100, 150 and 200 mg kg (-1) CIM, respectively, injected 2 h prior DDS administration. Groups 5-9 received the same treatment as group 2 but after the treatment of ranitidine (50 and 100 mg kg (-1) intraperitoneally (i.p.) in 200 microl DMSO) and famotidine (10, 50 and 100 mg kg (-1) i.p. in 200 microl DMSO), respectively. The animals were then anaesthetized with ether and blood was collected from the aorta for the determination of plasma DDS and monoacetyldapsone concentrations by HPLC and later for the determination of methaemoglobinaemia by spectrophotometry. CIM showed a higher affinity for cytochrome P-450 than famotidine and ranitidine. The results obtained showed the potentiality of the pharmacological effects of DDS with a low risk of adverse reactions, especially methaemoglobinaemia, which is dose dependent.
In an attempt to clarify the confusion about venous complications from intravenous diazepam, a study of 2,468 consecutive oral surgery and general dentistry cases in which diazepam was used was undertaken. It was found that 7.9% of the patients experienced local phlebitis and 4.5%, thrombophlebitis during the week after the injection. These findings were correlated with age, weight, sexual gender, dosage, type and duration of procedure, and degree of apprehension experienced by the patient.
We compared antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, chlorpromazine and clozapine) and sigma antagonists (remoxipride, cinuperone, alpha-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazine butanol (BMY 14802) and rimcazole) in the radio-ligand binding and behavioural experiments in rodents. A good correlation was established between the affinity of compounds at dopamine2-receptors in the striatum and their ability to block apomorphine-, amphetamine- and quipazine-induced behavioural effects in rodents. By contrast, no correlation was found between the behavioural effects of these drugs and their affinity at dopamine1-5-HT2- and sigma receptors. The rank order of potency among the studied antipsychotic drugs in the behavioural tests and at dopamine2-receptors was following: haloperidol > chlorpromazine > or = clozapine. The effectiveness of chlorpromazine and clozapine was nearly similar against apomorphine-induced aggressiveness and yawning, whereas at 5-HT2-receptors clozapine was more active than chlorpromazine. The weak activity of sigma antagonists at dopamine2 receptors could be a possible reason why these compounds were less effective in the behavioural studies compared to antipsychotic drugs. However, the antagonism of remoxipride against apomorphine-induced stereotypy and aggressiveness is not related to its activity at sigma receptors, because the other sigma antagonists did not block these effects of apomorphine. It is probable that remoxipride exerts its action through blocking of dopamine2 receptors. In conclusion, the present study revealed only weak activity of sigma antagonists in the behavioural models widely used to study the antipsychotic drugs. Therefore, the antipsychotic activity of sigma antagonists is doubtful.
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. The theory of targeting both cancer cells directly and their blood supply has significant therapeutic potential. However, to date, there are few clinically successful single agents that meet these criteria. 2-Methoxyestradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamate (2-MeOE2bisMATE) and 2-ethylestradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamate (2-EtE2bisMATE) are potent inhibitors of proliferation in a range of cancer cells. The work presented here demonstrates the potent in vitro and in vivo effects of these compounds. They cause apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and endothelial cells. Furthermore, they are potent anti-angiogenic inhibitors in vivo, as shown by their ability to reduce endothelial staining in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors. We have developed a novel, flow cytometry based, ex vivo method which shows in cells recovered from MDA-MB-231 tumors treated with 2-MeOE2bisMATE and 2-EtE2bisMATE an increase in intra-tumoral G(2)-M arrest and apoptosis. The degree of apoptosis inversely correlates to tumor volume. Further in vivo studies reveal that both 2-MeOE2bisMATE and 2-EtE2bisMATE are orally bioavailable and extremely efficacious when compared to clinically tested drugs. As these compounds are anti-proliferative against breast cancer and endothelial cells they have the potential to be potent, dual acting clinical drugs of the future.
A patient who was receiving rifampin treatment for tuberculosis developed heterogenous light-chain proteinuria and insidious renal failure after a period of fluid restriction. The renal damage was characterized pathologically by an interstitial nephritis with invasive tubular casts and an associated renal vein thrombosis. The possible role of the light-chain proteinuria in the pathogenesis of the renal failure is discussed.
Effect of dietary supplementation of astaxanthin (Ax) from Phaffia rhodozyma on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses was investigated in male broiler chickens fed a corn-based diet. Birds (1 week of age) were fed a corn-enriched diet containing either 0 or 100 ppm Ax for 2 weeks and were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg body weight). Inflammatory responses were evaluated by determining changes in expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) in cytokines and mediators related to inflammatory responses (interleukin (IL)-1 beta and -6, inducible nitrite synthase (iNOS), interferon (IFN)- γ and cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 in the liver and spleen after 2 h of LPS injection and plasma ceruloplasmin concentration as an acute phase protein. Birds fed Ax showed significantly higher iNOS mRNA expression in the liver and spleen compared to that of control birds. Ax-fed birds also showed greater increase in mRNA expression in the liver of IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-γ compared to that of control birds. The enhancing effect of Ax was further progressed when LPS was injected. No difference was found in plasma ceruloplasmin concentration between the Ax-fed group and control group. The results suggest that feeding supplementation of Ax (100 ppm) to a corn-enriched diet possibly does not have anti-inflammatory effect in male broiler chickens.
This paper reflects the intersection of three cultures: the rave (all night dance party and use of the drug, Ecstasy) culture; the ward culture of an inpatient psychiatric program for First Episode Psychosis; the spirit healing culture of the Philippines. All three intersected in Toronto, Canada in the mid 1990s, as illustrated by the clinical case of a 19-year-old university student who was hospitalized with symptoms of drug-induced psychosis. Her initial treatment was not successful and presented dilemmas for the treating staff. Transfer to a second psychiatric facility that permitted attendance at a traditional Filipino healing ceremony resulted in a cure, with no recurrence 10 years later. According to James Dow's 1986 formulation, the components of the key spiritual healing session paralleled the very elements the young woman had sought by participating in raves, an activity that was problematic because it led to family displeasure. Whereas attendance at a rave triggered illness, the healing session, sanctioned by her family and taking place in their midst, resulted in healing.
Dronedarone is a new antiarrhythmic drug that is being developed for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.
We conducted a multicenter trial to evaluate the use of dronedarone in 4628 patients with atrial fibrillation who had additional risk factors for death. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dronedarone, 400 mg twice a day, or placebo. The primary outcome was the first hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, and hospitalization due to cardiovascular events.
The mean follow-up period was 21+/-5 months, with the study drug discontinued prematurely in 696 of the 2301 patients (30.2%) receiving dronedarone and in 716 of the 2327 patients (30.8%) receiving placebo, mostly because of adverse events. The primary outcome occurred in 734 patients (31.9%) in the dronedarone group and in 917 patients (39.4%) in the placebo group, with a hazard ratio for dronedarone of 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.84; P<0.001). There were 116 deaths (5.0%) in the dronedarone group and 139 (6.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.08; P=0.18). There were 63 deaths from cardiovascular causes (2.7%) in the dronedarone group and 90 (3.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98; P=0.03), largely due to a reduction in the rate of death from arrhythmia with dronedarone. The dronedarone group had higher rates of bradycardia, QT-interval prolongation, nausea, diarrhea, rash, and an increased serum creatinine level than the placebo group. Rates of thyroid- and pulmonary-related adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups.
Dronedarone reduced the incidence of hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death in patients with atrial fibrillation. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00174785.)
Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition that usually requires surgical evacuation of the hematoma. We report a case of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma that was probably associated with aspirin intake. The initial clinical signs and symptoms included sharp, left-sided neck pain and weakness of the left arm. The initial magnetic resonance image showed a spinal epidural hematoma extending from C2 to C6, with compression of the myelon. This case is remarkable for dramatic clinical improvement within 12 hours and the magnetic resonance imaging documentation of complete resolution within 3 days. For each patient with a stable or improving neurological status, conservative management monitored by magnetic resonance imaging might be the treatment of choice.
5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and capecitabine are two of the most frequently prescribed chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of patients with cancer. Administration of test doses of 5FU to eight patients heterozygous for the IVS14+1G > A mutation and five control patients showed that the AUC and clearance were weak parameters with respect to the identification of patients with a DPD deficiency. However, highly significant differences were observed for the terminal half life of 5FU between DPD patients and controls. Thus, a DPD deficiency could be predicted from 5FU blood concentrations measured after the administration of a test dose of 5FU.
Visual field constriction (VFC) has been described in about 30 % to 50 % of patients treated with the antiepileptic drug (AED) Vigabatrin (GVG). The exact incidence of VFC related to GVG exposure is unknown. Risk factors other than medication have not been identified as yet, and it is unclear whether the occurrence of VFC is restricted to the use of GVG.
In a longitudinal study, we investigated 60 epilepsy patients who received GVG and other AEDs. Patients underwent full ophthalmological examination including perimetry.
16 of 60 patients exposed to different AEDs developed VFC, which was judged as clinically relevant by an experienced neuroophthalmologist. VFC was observed significantly more often in patients treated with GVG as add-on- or monotherapy as compared with patients who had never been exposed to GVG (13/29 versus 3/31). Within the subgroup of 23 patients who received GVG as add-on therapy, those who developed VFC had been exposed to GVG for significantly longer than patients without VFC. The only non-treatment related feature associated with VFC was older age. Type and severity of epilepsy or type and number of concomitant AED were not related to the occurrence of VFC.
The findings of an overrepresentation of VFC in patients receiving GVG and of a correlation between duration of GVG treatment and occurrence of VFC support the causal role of GVG treatment in the development of VFC. Old age is a possible risk factor for the development of VFC associated with GVG in epilepsy patients.
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) has good potential for the high-throughput identification of genetic aberrations in cell genomes. In the course of a program to screen a panel of oral squamous-cell carcinoma (OSCC), cell lines for genomic copy-number aberrations by array-CGH using our in-house arrays, we identified a 3-Mb homozygous deletion at 10p12 in 1 of 18 cell lines (5.6%). Among seven genes located within this region, expression of PRTFDC1 mRNA was not detected in 50% (9/18) or decreased in 5.6% (1/18) of OSCC cell lines, but detected in normal oral epithelia and restored in gene-silenced OSCC cells without its homozygous loss after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Among 17 cell lines without a homozygous deletion, the hypermethylation of the PRTFDC1 CpG island, which showed promoter activity, was observed in all nine cell lines with no or reduced PRTFDC1 expression (52.9%). Methylation of this CpG island was also observed in primary OSCC tissues (8/47, 17.0%). In addition, restoration of PRTFDC1 in OSCC cells lacking its expression inhibited cell growth in colony-formation assays, whereas knockdown of PRTFDC1 expression in OSCC cells expressing the gene promoted cell growth. These results suggest that epigenetic silencing of PRTFDC1 by hypermethylation of the CpG island leads to a loss of PRTFDC1 function, which might be involved in squamous cell oral carcinogenesis.
VILIP-1, a member of the neuronal Ca(2+) sensor protein family, is able to act as a tumor suppressor in carcinoma cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration. In order to study the role of VILIP-1 in skin carcinogenesis we generated transgenic mice overexpressing VILIP-1 in epidermis under the control of the bovine keratin K5 promoter (K5-VILIP-1). We studied the susceptibility of FVB wild type and VILIP-1 transgenic mice to chemically mediated carcinogenesis. After 30 weeks of treatment with a two-stage carcinogenesis protocol, all animals showed numerous skin tumors. Nevertheless, K5-VILIP-1 mice showed decreased squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) multiplicity of approximately 49% (p<0.02) with respect to the corresponding SCC multiplicity observed in wild type (WT) mice. In addition, the relative percentage of low-grade cutaneous SCCs grade I (defined by the differentiation pattern according to the Broders grading scale) increased approximately 50% in the K5-VILIP1 mice when compared with SCCs in WT mice. Similar tendency was observed using a complete carcinogenesis protocol for skin carcinogenesis using benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P). Further studies of tumors and primary epidermal keratinocyte cultures showed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) levels and cell proliferation decreased in K5-VILIP-1 mice when compared with their wild counterparts. In addition tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) expression was higher in K5-VILIP-1 keratinocytes. These results show that VILIP-1 overexpression decreases the susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis in experimental mouse cancer models, thus supporting its role as a tumor suppressor gene.
Gene expression alterations are essential for the process of carcinogenesis. A carcinogen may have specific mechanisms for inducing tumors, which may involve inducing characteristic gene expression alterations. In this study, we attempted to identify genes crucial for mammary carcinogenesis. For this purpose, we used human c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene transgenic rats (Hras128), which are highly sensitive to mammary carcinogens including N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, 7,12-dimethyl benz[a]anthracene, and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine. DNA microarray analysis revealed that glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2) was commonly up-regulated in the mammary carcinomas induced by the three different carcinogens, and its up-regulation was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blotting analysis. In addition, expression of GPX2 was recognized in all 41 immunohistochemically examined cases of human breast cancer. Forced suppression of GPX2 expression by siRNA resulted in significant growth inhibition in both rat and human mammary carcinoma cell lines with wild-type p53 cells. Thus, these data suggested that GPX2 may be involved in mammary carcinogenesis and cell proliferation in both rats and humans, indicating that GPX2 may be a novel target for the prevention and therapy of breast cancer.
This study was designed to investigate whether either of 2 dosage schedules of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was effective in preventing chronic doxorubicin-induced heart failure in dogs. Thirty-eight dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: controls, 10 dogs; doxorubicin only, 12 dogs; doxorubicin + low dose NAC, 8 dogs; and doxorubicin + high dose NAC, 8 dogs. All dogs except the controls received 1 mg/kg of doxorubicin weekly for 8 weeks and then every other week for 8 weeks. The doxorubicin + low-dose NAC group received 140 mg/kg of NAC 30 minutes before each dose of doxorubicin. The doxorubicin + high-dose NAC group received NAC before and then twice a day for 5 days. Systolic time intervals and echocardiograms were obtained weekly; cardiac catheterization was performed at the conclusion of the study. Of the 38 dogs in the study, 9 died; all deaths were in the doxorubicin treatment groups. The incidence of death was not different between the doxorubicin-only, the doxorubicin + low-dose and the doxorubicin + high-dose NAC groups. The noninvasive and the invasive and the catheterization data generally revealed poorer cardiac function of the doxorubicin treatment groups than in controls. However, no significant differences existed between the doxorubicin-only and doxorubicin + low-dose and doxorubicin + high-dose NAC groups. In conclusion, NAC in a low- or high-dose regimen did not significantly ameliorate doxorubicin cardiac toxicity. Because NAC is a free radical scavenger, perhaps doxorubicin cardiac toxicity is not a result of free radical generation.
To establish the animal model of lung injury caused by hydrochloric acid in rats, measure the alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) in different acidic condition.
32 rats were randomly divided into 4 groups which were control group (pH = 7.4) and HCl groups (pH = 7.0, 4.5, 2.5). The animals were anesthetized and ventilated for 1 hour. Blood gas analysis was performed, then the permeability of lung epithelial barrier and AFC were measured.
The permeability of lung epithelial barrier, PaO(2) and AFC of pH 7.0 group were similar to control group (P > 0.05), but declined in pH 4.5 and 2.5 groups (P < 0.05).
The alveolar epithelium and the alveolar epithelial barrier are resistant to the injurious effects of acid, but high concentration acid can induce damage.
Liver allograft hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection and hepatitis B (HB) recurrence jeopardize the long-term survival of recipient and liver allograft. Lamivudine has been referred as a novel antiviral agent against HBV in HBV cirrhotic patients even in liver transplantation setting. We assessed the prophylatic effect of lamivudine on liver allograft HBV reinfection and clarified the dynamic changes of HBV markers in HBV related decompensated liver cirrhosis after liver transplantation.
Twenty-five recipients were divided into three groups: HBV active replication group (15 recipients), HBV inactive replication group (7), and control group (3). 100 mg/d lamivudine was administered preoperatively except in the control group. The HBV markers of serial sera and liver biopsy samples of the 25 recipients were evaluated regularly with enzyme-linked radioimmunoassay, HBV DNA fluorescent quantitative assay, immunohistochemical staining, labelled streptavidin biotin (LSAB) and digoxin labelled HBV DNA hybridization in situ. The dynamic alternation of HBV markers under lamivudine prophylaxis was observed.
In the HBV active replication group who had received lamivudine 2 weeks before liver transplantation, serum HBV DNA positive converted to negative by 80%. HBsAg of all recipients disappeared after liver transplantation, but corresponding antibodies of HBV appeared within one week after the operation. HBsAb 9/15, HBcAb 13/15 and HBeAb 11/15 appeared and subsided gradually within 24 weeks. HBV DNA in sera was kept negative; HBsAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA hybridization in situ of liver biopsy samples remained negative after use of lamivudine. Ten of the 15 recipients showed clearance of HBV, and per se HBV markers were undetectable both in serum and liver biopsy samples between 12 to 44 weeks (24 weeks on average). The 1-, 2-year survival rates were 83% in this group. Two of the 15 recipients developed HBV allograft reinfection or recurrence of hepatitis 2 years after lamivudine monoprophylaxis (2/15, 13.3%). In the HBV inactive replication group, the outcome was similar to that of the HBV active group. The HBV antibody frequency was HBsAb 4/7, HBcAb 6/7, and HBeAb 2/7. Three of 7 recipients showed HBV clearance both in sera and liver biopsy samples, whereas in the control group all 3 recipients developed HBV allograft reinfection and recurrent hepatitis 8, 10, 12 months postoperatively; one of them died of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, and the remaining 2 recovered after additional lamivudine therapy. The overall allograft reinfection rate was 9.1% (2/22) and the overall 1-, 2-year survival rates were 87% in the lamivudine prophylaxis group.
Lamivudine prophylaxis can prevent effectively liver allograft from HBV reinfection in patients with HBV-related decompensated liver cirrhosis even in HBV active replication recipient after liver transplantation. Its long-term outcome remains to be studied.
A cylinder plate bioassay for 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) is described which permits determination of 5-FC concentrations in biological fluids in the presence of amphotericin B. Using this assay, we determined serum concentrations in 12 patients after a single dose of drug and in 8 patients receiving daily 5-FC at 6-hr intervals (4 to 120 days). Drug was detectable in serum as early as 0.5 hr and concentrations were measurable as long as 24 hr after a dose, regardless of renal function. Peak concentrations occurred 6 hr after the initial drug dose, but were seen between 1 and 2 hr after a dose in all patients receiving a minimum of 4 days of therapy. Mild to moderate renal impairment produced marked increases in peak 5-FC concentrations in the serum of a group of eight patients on three different dosage schedules. Five patients were studied before and after amphotericin B-induced renal insufficiency. Peak concentrations increased from 14 to 142% concomitant with the change in renal function. Parallel studies in rabbits confirmed the results in our patients. 5-FC half-life in the serum of 10 rabbits increased from 3.35 +/- 0.27 to 24.63 +/- 0.70 hr after experimentally induced acute renal failure. Concentrations of 5-FC in the cerebrospinal fluid of five patients ranged from 17 to 62 mug/ml and were 74.4 +/- 5.6% of simultaneously determined serum concentrations. The effect of renal function on 5-FC concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid was similar to that seen with serum.
The accurate assessment of both tobacco withdrawal and the impact of the nicotine patch on withdrawal may be compromised by attrition of subjects, or by subjects smoking during withdrawal. To reduce these occurrences, 211 participants were provided with intensive cessation counseling while trying to quit smoking with either nicotine (21 mg) or placebo transdermal patches. Subject attrition was low, with 80.5% of participants continuing through the 5-week study period. Abstinence rates were also high over this period (75% and 61% in active and placebo groups, respectively). In this multisite, double-blind trial, withdrawal severity was assessed using a nine-item daily self-report questionnaire, and abstinence was confirmed via CO monitoring. Abrupt smoking cessation increased multiple tobacco withdrawal symptoms/signs including craving for cigarettes, irritability, anxiety, appetite, sleep disruption, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, depression, and impatience. Treatment with transdermal nicotine reduced craving for cigarettes, anxiety, irritability, and appetite, as well as weight gain (1.85 versus 2.88 kg mean gain over 4 weeks in active and placebo groups, respectively).
A fall in blood pressure occurs, in most patients, within a few hours of a single dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. While a serious fall in pressure is unusual in previously untreated essential hypertension, some patients are at risk of severe first-dose hypotension. These include those with treated heart failure, severe hypertension on polypharmacy, 'renin-dependent' renovascular hypertension and the occasional elderly patient. In such groups of patients the incidence of severe, symptomatic first-dose hypotension approaches 10%. This effect is not specific for ACE inhibitor therapy and may well occur as frequently with other drugs in such patients. First-dose hypotension may not be accompanied by tachycardia, possibly as a result of a parasympathomimetic action that may contribute to the first-dose effect. It is generally not possible to predict patients at risk, although plasma renin and angiotensin II concentrations show a modest positive correlation with the initial fall in blood pressure. The maximum initial hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors is not clearly dose related but the duration of effect may be. Therefore such drugs should be started at minimum effective dosage. High-risk patients should be observed closely for at least 6 h. Symptomatic hypotension usually responds to supine rest although infusion of angiotensin II, atropine and occasionally saline may be required.
The major protein constituent of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta). Amyloid deposits contain "chaperone molecules" which play critical roles in amyloid formation and toxicity. In the present work, we test an analog of hyperforin (IDN 5706) which releases the AChE from both the Abeta fibrils and the AChE-Abeta burdens in transgenic mice. Hyperforin is an acylphloroglucinol compound isolated from Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort), which is able to prevent the Abeta-induced spatial memory impairments and Abeta neurotoxicity. Altogether this gathered evidence indicates the important role of AChE in the neurotoxicity of Abeta plaques and finding new compounds which decrease the AChE-Abeta interaction may be a putative therapeutic agent to fight the disease.
The p75(NTR) acts as a tumor suppressor in the prostate, but its expression is lost as prostate cancer progresses and is minimal in established prostate cancer cell lines such as PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP. Previously, we showed that treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen induced p75(NTR) expression in PC-3 and DU-145 cells leading to p75(NTR)-mediated decreased survival. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which these drugs induce p75(NTR) expression. We show that the observed increase in p75(NTR) protein due to R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen treatment was accompanied by an increase in p75(NTR) mRNA, and this increase in mRNA was the result of increased mRNA stability and not by an up-regulation of transcription. In addition, we show that treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen led to sustained activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway with the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB202190 or by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of p38 MAPK protein prevented induction of p75(NTR) by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. We also observed that siRNA knockdown of MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK)-2 and MK3, the kinases downstream of p38 MAPK that are responsible for the mRNA stabilizing effects of the p38 MAPK pathway, also prevented an induction of p75(NTR) by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. Finally, we identify the RNA stabilizing protein HuR and the posttranscriptional regulator eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E as two possible mechanisms by which the p38 MAPK pathway may increase p75(NTR) expression. Collectively, the data suggest that R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen induce p75(NTR) expression by increased mRNA stability that is mediated through the p38 MAPK pathway.
Impulsive behaviour is an important component of many psychiatric syndromes. It is often expressed as aggressive or violent behaviour, but may also be non-violent. One important factor which might lead to aggression or violence is an inability to tolerate a delay of gratification, leading to frustration and aggressive outbursts. In animals and in man, tolerance to delay of gratification can be studied using delay of reinforcement (also known as self-control) procedures. Experiments with delay of reinforcement in rats show that serotonergic mechanisms may be involved in this form of impulsive behaviour, which seems to support clinical findings in this area. The present experiment examined the effects of a series of psychoactive drugs on delays of reinforcement using a steady state operant procedure involving lever-pressing by rats. Rats were trained to choose between one food pellet delivered immediately and three or five pellets delivered after varying delays which increased during the course of the session. Using this procedure the rats remained sensitive to within-and between-session variations in delay of reinforcement even after long periods of testing. It was used to demonstrate an increase in impulsivity (after d-amphetamine) and a reduction in impulsivity (after diazepam and metergoline), indicated by shifts in the choice/delay function. The other drugs tested, imipramine, citalopram, haloperidol and carbamazepine, had no consistent effects although tested at doses which are active in other procedures. This method has proved to be a useful way of examining the effects of drugs on choice of delay of reinforcement in the rat. Although the behavioural basis of tolerance to delay of reinforcement (self-control) has received considerable attention, little is yet known about the biological basis. The present data indicate that the procedure described here can be used to elucidate the pharmacological basis of this aspect of impulsive behaviour.
The emulsion formulation of propofol (Diprivan) evokes pain on i.v. injection, although its pH and osmolality are close to those of blood. The pain induced by serial dilutions of propofol in Intralipid and 5% glucose was examined in isolated vein segments and after intracutaneous injection. Propofol evoked pain in a concentration-related manner in six of eight subjects after i.v. perfusion and in all eight subjects after intracutaneous injections. Pain was maximal with propofol 56 x 10(-3) mol litre-1 when visual analogue pain scale was 60% of maximum (range 20-92%) for venous perfusion and 89% (range 66-100%) for intracutaneous injection. Dilution with 10% Intralipid reduced pain more than that with 5% glucose. We conclude that the intensity of pain after i.v. injection of propofol was related to its free aqueous concentration.
Gobiocypris rarus is an emerging fish model for aquatic toxicology in China as it is sensitive to environmental hormone disruptors. Exogenous sex steroids can affect sex differentiation and the expression of sex-related genes. Foxl2, a member of forkhead-box transcription factor family, is the key gene for ovary development and its mutation causes the blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome in human. We find that two foxl2 genes exist in fish genome, one is foxl2, and the other is foxl2b. Here, we reported the isolation and expression of foxl2 in G. rarus. G. rarus foxl2 cDNA is 1700bp in length with a 921bp of open reading frame encoding 306 amino acids containing the typical FH-domain. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed its predominant expression in the eye, brain, gill and gonads. Moreover, the expression level in the ovary was significantly higher than that in the testis. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that foxl2 was up regulated after treatment with estradiol and was down regulated with 2-methyl-testosterone. These results suggested that Foxl2 plays an important role in female development of G. rarus, foxl2 mRNA expression is regulated by downstream sex hormones, and foxl2 can be used as a molecular indicator monitoring the environmental endocrine disruptors.
We studied the long-term efficacy (median follow-up of 28 months) of adefovir (ADV) in combination with lamivudine (LAM) in 132 LAM-resistant Japanese patients with chronic genotype C-dominant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
The viral response (undetectable HBV-DNA by PCR assay) and the predictor of viral response were evaluated. The emergence of ADV-resistant mutants was investigated during the combination therapy.
The cumulative probability of viral response was 69% at 12 months, and 81% at 24 months. Multivariate analysis identified baseline HBe antigen status (P=0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase level (AST) (P=0.001) and HBV-DNA level (P=0.002) as determinants of viral response to treatment. At the beginning of ADV therapy, substitutions at rtA181 (rtA181T and rtA181S) were identified in 3 patients (2.3%). In the remaining 129 patients, the rtM204 mutants were identified at baseline, and two (1.6%) of the 129 patients developed new ADV-resistant mutants; one was rtA181S and another was rtA181T plus rtN236T mutation.
Adefovir and lamivudine combination therapy effectively suppressed viral replication and maintained the efficacy well in LAM-resistant patients with chronic HBV infection. Genotypic analysis indicated that the emergence of ADV-resistant mutants is rare, at least over a period of 2 years, in patients with combination therapy.
Pulmonary distribution and lung functions were evaluated during a 4-month inhaled corticosteroid treatment period in 10 steroid-naïve novel asthmatics with normal or slightly reduced lung functions. Patients were given a total daily dose of 1000 microg of beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol twice a day via a pressured metered dose inhaler with a large-volume chamber device (Volumatic, GlaxoSmith Kline, U.K.). Gamma lung scintigraphy and lung function tests were performed before and after 2 months and 4 months. Inhaled 99mTc-labelled beclomethasone dipropionate liposomes were used to assess lung deposition patterns during inhaled steroid therapy. Serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) concentration was used as a surrogate marker of asthmatic inflammation. Following beclomethasone treatment, all lung functions were enhanced, but only FVC values showed significant improvement. The FEV1/FVC ratio remained slightly reduced in spite of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. However, the association between changes in improved FVC values and reduced ECP levels proved to be statistically significant. In lung scintigraphy, no evidence of changes in pulmonary deposition patterns were seen during the follow-up period. We conclude that inhaled corticosteroid therapy can lead to improvements in lung functions and surrogate markers of airway inflammation in novel asthma without affecting the peripheral deposition pattern of aerosols.
