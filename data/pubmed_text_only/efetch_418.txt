Niacin is a recognized treatment for dyslipidemia due to its favorable effects on all lipid parameters. However, the clinical use of niacin has been limited by its adverse effects, particularly cutaneous flushing. A newly reformulated 1,000 mg niacin ER tablet has been designed to reduce flushing relative to the original commercial niacin ER formulation. The aim of this study is to compare the incidence, intensity and duration of flushing between the 1,000 mg reformulated niacin ER and the 1,000 mg commercially available formulation, when administered as a single 2,000 mg dose to healthy male volunteers.
This was a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover, flush provocation study conducted at a single center. To increase the probability of flushing, subjects were administered niacin ER at the upper limit of the approved dosage range (2,000 mg), and were precluded from using aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the study. Subjects received reformulated niacin ER, commercial niacin ER or placebo in a 3-way crossover fashion. The primary flushing variable was the occurrence of a flushing event. Secondary flushing variables included the number of flushing episodes, intensity and duration of flushing for both overall flushing events and for individual symptoms of flushing (redness, warmth, tingling and itching).
A total of 156 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of 133 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication in at least 2 study periods, 89% of subjects experienced flushing during treatment with reformulated niacin ER, and 98% of subjects experienced flushing during treatment with commercial niacin ER. This difference was statistically significant (p - 0.0027). Reformulated niacin ER resulted in a 42% reduction in median flush intensity (p < 0.0001) and a 43% reduction in median flush duration (p < 0.0001) relative to commercial niacin ER. The duration of first flushing event was more than 1 hour shorter with reformulated niacin ER. During the study, 29% of subjects (45/156) experienced treatment-emergent adverse events, which were mostly mild in intensity and considered to be remotely related or unrelated to the study drug.
The 1,000 mg reformulated niacin ER tablet substantially decreases the incidence, intensity and duration of flushing relative to the commercially available 1,000 mg niacin ER tablet, and represents an improved niacin therapy option.
Left ventricular apical ballooning is an increasingly reported phenomenon with an onset that is usually triggered by severe and often acute emotional incidents. We report a rare case of acute left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, mimicking acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, in a post menopausal woman whose only predisposing factor was an all-night cocaine binge.
Organisms and their cells vary greatly in their tolerance of low oxygen environments (hypoxia). A delineation of the determinants of hypoxia tolerance is incomplete, despite intense interest for its implications in diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction. The insulin/IGF-1 receptor (IGFR) signaling pathway controls survival of Caenorhabditis elegans from a variety of stressors including aging, hyperthermia, and hypoxia. daf-2 encodes a C. elegans IGFR homolog whose primary signaling pathway modulates the activity of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. DAF-16 regulates the transcription of a large number of genes, some of which have been shown to control aging. To identify genes that selectively regulate hypoxic sensitivity, we compared the whole-organismal transcriptomes of three daf-2 reduction-of-function alleles, all of which are hypoxia resistant, thermotolerant, and long lived, but differ in their rank of severities for these phenotypes. The transcript levels of 172 genes were increased in the most hypoxia resistant daf-2 allele, e1370, relative to the other alleles whereas transcripts from only 10 genes were decreased in abundance. RNAi knockdown of 6 of the 10 genes produced a significant increase in organismal survival after hypoxic exposure as would be expected if down regulation of these genes by the e1370 mutation was responsible for hypoxia resistance. However, RNAi knockdown of these genes did not prolong lifespan. These genes definitively separate the mechanisms of hypoxic sensitivity and lifespan and identify biological strategies to survive hypoxic injury.
The efficacy and safety of fluoxetine were compared with those of imipramine and of placebo in a 6-week randomized double-blind parallel study of patients with major depressive illness. Mean values for all efficacy measurements were improved over baseline with fluoxetine and imipramine treatment (p less than .001). More fluoxetine patients completed the study than did imipramine or placebo patients. Predominant adverse experiences reported by imipramine patients were dry mouth and dizziness/lightheadedness. Predominant adverse experiences reported by fluoxetine patients were drowsiness/sedation and excessive sweating. In a subsequent 48-week open-label study, the predominant adverse experience in the fluoxetine group was excessive sweating and in the imipramine group was still dry mouth. In this study, fluoxetine relieved the symptoms of major depressive illness effectively and significantly better than placebo and was better tolerated than imipramine.
Fluoxetine was compared to doxepin in geriatric out-patients with major depressive illness. At the end of the 6-week double-blind study, the mean endpoint scores for all rating scales were significantly improved over base-line in both treatment groups. A subsequent 48-week open-label study supported the finding that both drugs are efficacious for maintenance therapy in elderly depressed patients. Fluoxetine, which lacks anticholinergic effects and is nonsedating, was well-tolerated by most patients and had fewer total side effects than doxepin. Common drug-related side effects for fluoxetine included nervousness/anxiety and nausea. Common side effects of doxepin were dry mouth, drowsiness/sedation, constipation, and dizziness/lightheadedness.
To analyze the characteristics of hepatotoxicity due to ticlopidine.
We describe all the case of hepatotoxicity attributed to ticlopidine and reported to the Register of drug associated hepatopathies. We also obtained data from MEDLINE and the Spanish Medical Index regarding cases reported during the period 1982 2001.
We reported twelve cases of hepatopathy related to the use of ticlopidine. These made up 5% of all the cases notified to the Register. Eighty three percent of the patients were male, and of an average age of 68 years. Sixty six percent required hospital admission. The latent period varied between 2 and 13 weeks. The liver lesion was of cholestatic type in 75% of the cases, hepatocellular in 16.6% and mixed in 8.3%. Twenty five percent of the patients had received sub therapeutic doses.
Ticlopidine is often related to hepatotoxicity. This seems to be due to an idiosyncratic mechanism and is mainly cholestatic. The use of lower dosage than that recommended means that the desired therapeutic effect is not attained but does not protect against the development of hepatotoxicity. Doctors who use this drug should be aware of this so as to establish the true risk benefit relation.
Primary cellular immunodeficiencies are a group of genetic disorders in which 1 or more components of the cellular immune system are lacking or dysfunctional.
We sought to identify novel mouse mutants that display primary cellular immunodeficiencies.
Genome-wide N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis was performed in mice, followed by a phenotype screen of immunologic blood parameters.
We identified novel mouse mutants with isolated B-cell deficiency, combined block in early B- and T-cell development, combined T-cell and natural killer cell reduction, and 3 different forms of T-cell deficiencies. One of the mutants, designated DeltaT3, displayed a combined phenotype of increased IgE, absence of peripheral T cells, and block in late thymocyte differentiation. In addition, DeltaT3 mice were unable to mount specific humoral immune responses. Chromosomal mapping and sequencing of candidate genes revealed a novel point mutation in the kinase domain of the T-cell receptor zeta chain-associated protein kinase (Zap70). In contrast to Zap70-deficient mice, DeltaT3 mutants displayed normal Zap70 mRNA and residual Zap70 protein levels. Complementation studies with Zap70-deficient mice confirmed that the point mutation found in Zap70 was causative for the DeltaT3 phenotype, including increased IgE plasma levels, a phenotype that has not been associated with altered Zap70 function in the past.
Random genome-wide mutagenesis combined with a phenotype screen can be used to generate novel mouse mutants with primary cellular immunodeficiencies.
To elucidate possible mode of action (MOA) and human relevance of hepatotumorigenicity in rats for ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), male F344 rats were administered ETBE at doses of 0, 150 and 1000 mg/kg body weight twice a day by gavage for 1 and 2 weeks. For comparison, non-genotoxic carcinogen phenobarbital (PB) was applied at a dose of 500 ppm in diet. Significant increase of P450 total content and hydroxyl radical levels by low, high doses of ETBE and PB treatments at weeks 1 and 2, and 8-OHdG formation at week 2, accompanied accumulation of CYP2B1/2B2, CYP3A1/3A2 and CYP2C6, and downregulation of DNA oxoguanine glycosylase 1, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in hepatocytes, respectively. Up-regulation of CYP2E1 and CYP1A1 at weeks 1 and 2, and peroxisome proliferation at week 2 were found in high dose ETBE group. Results of proteome analysis predicted activation of upstream regulators of gene expression altered by ETBE including constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). These results indicate that the MOA of ETBE hepatotumorigenicity in rats may be related to induction of oxidative stress, 8-OHdG formation, subsequent cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, suggesting regenerative cell proliferation after week 2, predominantly via activation of CAR and PXR nuclear receptors by a mechanism similar to that of PB, and differentially by activation of PPARs. The MOA for ETBE hepatotumorigenicity in rats is unlikely to be relevant to humans.
To describe a novel complication of therapy with all-trans retinoic acid in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Case series.
Comprehensive cancer center.
Consecutive patients with a morphologic diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia who underwent remission induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, 45 mg/m2 body surface area per day.
Nine of 35 patients (26%; 95% CI, 9% to 52%) with acute promyelocytic leukemia who were treated with all-trans retinoic acid developed a syndrome consisting primarily of fever and respiratory distress. Additional prominent signs and symptoms included weight gain, lower-extremity edema, pleural or pericardial effusions, and episodic hypotension. The onset of this symptom complex occurred from 2 to 21 days after starting treatment. Three deaths occurred; post-mortem examinations in two patients showed pulmonary interstitial infiltration with maturing myeloid cells. Six other patients survived, each achieving complete remission (five patients with all-trans retinoic acid only; 1 patient with chemotherapy). In six of the nine cases, the onset of the syndrome was preceded by an increase in peripheral blood leukocytes to a level of at least 20 x 10(9) cells/L. Certain therapeutic interventions, including leukapheresis, temporary cessation of therapy with all-trans retinoic acid, and cytotoxic chemotherapy in moderate doses were not useful after respiratory distress was established. However, the administration of high-dose corticosteroid therapy (dexamethasone, 10 mg IV intravenously every 12 hours for 3 or more days) early in the course of the syndrome resulted in prompt symptomatic improvement and full recovery in three of four patients.
The use of all-trans retinoic acid to induce hematologic remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated in some patients with the development of a potentially lethal syndrome that is not uniformly accompanied by peripheral blood leukocytosis. Early recognition of the symptom complex of fever and dyspnea, combined with prompt corticosteroid treatment, may decrease morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome.
The efficacy against mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) of a bednet treated with carbamate insecticide [carbosulfan capsule suspension (CS) 200 mg/m(2)] was compared with four types of pyrethroid-treated nets in veranda-trap huts at Yaokoffikro near Bouaké, Côte d'Ivoire, where the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles carries the kdr gene (conferring pyrethroid resistance) at high frequency and Culex quinquefasciatus Say is also pyrethroid resistant. Pyrethroids compared were lambdacyhalothrin CS 18 mg/m(2), alphacypermethrin water dispersible granules (WG) 20 mg/m(2), deltamethrin 50 mg/m(2) (Permanet) and permethrin emulsifiable concentrate (EC) 500 mg/m(2). Insecticidal power and personal protection from mosquito bites were assessed before and after the nets were used for 8 months and hand washed five times in cold soapy water. Before washing, all treatments except permethrin significantly reduced blood-feeding and all had significant insecticidal activity against An. gambiae. The carbosulfan net gave significantly higher killing of An. gambiae than all pyrethroid treatments except the Permanet. Against Culex spp., carbosulfan was more insecticidal and gave a significantly better protective effect than any of the pyrethroid treatments. After washing, treated nets retained various degrees of efficacy against both mosquito genera - but least for the carbosulfan net. Washed nets with three types of pyrethroid treatment (alphacypermethrin, lambdacyhalothrin, permethrin) gave significantly higher mortality rates of Culex than in huts with the same pyrethroid-treated nets before washing. After five washes, the Permanet, which is sold as a long-lasting insecticidal product, performed no better than the other nets in our experimental conditions.
Morphine pellets (2 x 75 mg) were subcutaneously implanted in rats and vigilance states (wakefulness, slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep) were observed during ten days. Significant impairment of each vigilance state distribution appeared during the first days of morphine dependence. Although waking and slow wave sleep were not affected during the last days, paradoxical sleep duration was reduced during dependence. Nevertheless, the sleep-wake circadian rhythm was not abolished. These results suggest that the sleep process is affected differently in its components (slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep) during morphine dependence.
We investigated the effect of acute renal and hepatic dysfunction on the neurotoxicity of ranitidine, a histamine H2 receptor antagonist. Experimental acute hepatic and renal dysfunction in mice were produced by i.p. injection of uranyl nitrate (UN) and carbon tetrachloride (CT), respectively. Ranitidine was then constantly infused into the tail vein until the onset of clonic convulsion. When compared to control mice, UN treated mice had a significantly shorter onset time to clonic convulsion, lower total dose and higher plasma concentration at initiation of clonic convulsion. In contrast, the convulsive threshold concentration in the brain of UN treated mice was not significantly different from that of control mice. In CT treated mice, all pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data described above were not significantly different from those of the control mice. No significant difference in the brain/plasma concentration ratio was observed between both disease models and the corresponding control mice. Finally, the effect of UN and CT treatment on the convulsive potency after intracerebral (i.c.) administration of ranitidine was investigated in mice. Potentiation of the intrinsic neurotoxic sensitivity to ranitidine could not be demonstrated for mice with renal or hepatic dysfunction. From these findings, we conclude that renal dysfunction is a risk factor for ranitidine neurotoxicity, and this increased risk results from increase in the drug concentration in plasma and brain as a result of impaired renal excretion. No apparent effect of acute hepatic dysfunction was observed on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior of the drug.
Vecuronium is a curaric agent, largely used in anesthesia. Indications as to its employ in uremic patients appear to be debated because of partial renal elimination of the drug. A 52-year-old hemodialyzed woman required transplantectomy for rejection. At awakeness after general anesthesia (induced with fentanyl, propofol, and 6 mg of vecuronium, repeated with a single 2 mg dose 30 min later), she presented diafragmatic and muscular limb weakeness that lasted 180 min in spite of prostigmine administration. A 2 h 30 min predilutional hemofiltration was then performed, which induced rapid disappearance of neuromuscular blockade. Even if vecuronium can be used in dialysis patients, one should remember its possible side effects, especially with repeated doses, in determining prolonged neuromuscular blockade. Cautious use of this drug in renal failure is mandatory. Low dosage must be employed and repeated administration avoided. Neuromuscular blockade seems to be rapidly reversible with dialytic treatment.
Aspirin has been found to prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension and to induce nitric oxide (NO) release from vascular endothelium. Low-dose aspirin has also been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) when administered at bedtime, as opposed to upon awakening, in untreated hypertensive patients and high-risk pregnant women. Accordingly, we investigated the effects on ambulatory BP of aspirin administered at different times of the day in prehypertension.
We studied 244 subjects with prehypertension, 43.0 +/- 13.0 years of age, randomly divided in three groups: nonpharmacological hygienic-dietary recommendations; the same recommendations and aspirin (100 mg/day) on awakening; or the same recommendations and aspirin at bedtime. BP was measured for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention.
Ambulatory BP was unchanged in subjects randomized to either nonpharmacological intervention or aspirin on awakening. A significant ambulatory BP reduction was, however, observed in the subjects who received aspirin at bedtime (decrease of 6/3 mm Hg in the 24-h mean of systolic (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP), respectively; P < 0.001), without changes in heart rate (HR) from baseline. BP was homogeneously controlled along the 24 h after bedtime aspirin administration (6/4 mm Hg reduction in activity mean of SBP/DBP; 6/3 mm Hg reduction in sleep-time mean, respectively).
This prospective trial documents a significant effect on BP of low dose aspirin only when ingested at bedtime by prehypertensive subjects. The timed administration of low-dose aspirin could thus provide a valuable and cost-effective approach for BP control in subjects at elevated risk of developing hypertension.
Polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) gene increase susceptibility to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. We examined genetic and pharmacogenetic associations between NOS3 polymorphisms, blood pressure (BP) control, and cardiovascular events in elderly, hypertensive coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.
Patients with CAD were randomly assigned to either verapamil SR- or atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment and followed for cardiovascular events. Cases (all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke) and an age-, sex-, race/ethnicity-matched control population were genotyped for the -786T>C and Glu298>Asp polymorphisms in NOS3. On-treatment BP and BP control were compared across genotype groups. Logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the -786T>C and Glu298>Asp polymorphisms in the combined population and in randomized treatment groups.
Genotype data were available for 256 cases and 769 controls. Among controls, mean on-treatment BP differed according to -786T>C genotype (T/T 137/78 mm Hg, T/C 133/76 mm Hg, C/C 133/75 mm Hg; P = 0.0007 for systolic, P = 0.09 for diastolic) which corresponded to differing rates of BP control (T/T 63%, T/C 72%, C/C 88%; P = 0.002). Neither polymorphisms was associated with case status, with or without regard to assigned treatment.
The -786T>C, but not the Glu298>Asp variant of NOS3, may correlate with BP but do not appear to be associated with incident cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease. The antihypertensive treatment approach did not appear to alter the genetic contribution to either BP control or cardiovascular events.
Oxidation by copper/quinone-containing serum amine oxidases (SAO) is a well-known cause of polyamine cytotoxicity. Spermine oxidation exerts potent immunosuppressive effects in animal cells, but the cell death mechanism involved remains unclear. We compared biochemical and morphological parameters of SAO-mediated cell death in L1210 mouse leukemia cells with normal or amplified ornithine decarboxylase gene expression with those observed during apoptosis induced by deregulated polyamine uptake or by okadaic acid. None of the characteristic features of apoptotic cell death (e.g., chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage) were observed during spermine oxidation-mediated cell death, which was clearly necrotic by morphological criteria. Inhibition of a wide spectrum of caspases did not prevent SAO-dependent cell death, whereas N-acetylcysteine completely abolished the cytotoxic effects of spermine oxidation. Catalase only delayed spermine oxidation-induced cell death without affecting its modality or preventing depletion of intracellular glutathione, suggesting that both H(2)O(2) and aminoaldehydes generated by SAO-mediated spermine oxidation contribute to SAO-induced necrosis. Interestingly, redistribution of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, usually a diagnostic feature of apoptosis, preceded necrotic cytolysis triggered by spermine oxidation. Thus, L1210 cell death caused by SAO-mediated spermine oxidation has all the attributes of primary necrosis, but is also accompanied by loss of phospholipid asymmetry, indicating that the latter phenomenon may not be unique to apoptosis. Phosphatidylserine exposure, a potent engulfment signal for phagocytes, might contribute to the immunosuppressive effects of plasma polyamines through a controlled and rapid necrotic process involving SAO.
Resistance of head lice to pyrethroids induces difficult therapeutic problems. Previous studies demonstrated that this resistance was present in a French urban area, but its prevalence needed to be more precisely evaluated in terms of genotyping lice collected from more infested children over a certain period of time. We monitored the presence of the head lice kdr-like haplotype of the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit gene in schoolchildren seen three times on a 6-wk period. The prevalence of pediculosis was 2.39% (n = 1551). Genotyped lice (n = 167) were homozygous resistant in all but one pupil. The high frequency of the mutant haplotype (0.93) advocated for the abandonment of pyrethroid insecticides in this area and for the consideration of other treatment options.
The efficacy of fluoxetine was evaluated in depressed patients in double-blind imipramine- and placebo-controlled clinical trials. Fluoxetine produced greater improvement than placebo on all major efficacy parameters and was comparable to imipramine with respect to the primary indicators of depression. Fluoxetine had significantly less associated anticholinergic effects, dizziness, drowsiness, somatosensory disturbance, and excessive sweating than imipramine. Although nausea occurred more frequently in fluoxetine patients, it was generally mild and well tolerated. A significantly smaller percentage of fluoxetine than imipramine patients terminated therapy because of adverse experiences.
Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias affect many parkinsonian patients chronically treated with levodopa. Imbalance between gabaergic direct and indirect striatopallidal pathways may originate them. Manipulating GABA neurotransmission may be effective in the treatment of these patients. Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug that increases the synthesis and release of GABA. Previous studies suggest that gabapentin may be useful in Parkinson disease (PD).
To know the effects of gabapentin on the motor response to levodopa in PD patients with motor complications.
A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial with four weeks of treatment.
A tertiary referral center.
Twenty subjects with PD and motor fluctuations and dyskinesias on stable antiparkinsonian treatment, took gabapentin up to a maximum dose of 2.400 mg/d in three doses and placebo.
Three levodopa challenges were performed: at the beginning of the study and at the end of each period of treatment (4 weeks). Basal (off) and best (on) motor status were assessed by the UPDRS III. Latency to peak effect, magnitude of motor response (difference between "on" and "off" scores in the UPDRS III), duration of motor response and severity and duration of dyskinesias after each levodopa challenge were assessed. Patients' diaries were administered.
: Fifteen patients completed the study. A significant improvement in the basal UPDRS III resulting in a significant reduction in the magnitude of the motor response after gabapentin was obtained (P < 0.001). No other changes were observed, either on pharmacological parameters or in levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Number of daily hours spent in "on," "on with dyskinesias" and "off" also remained unchanged. Tolerance was good, dizziness being the most common side effect.
Gabapentin improved parkinsonian symptoms (basal UPDRS III and magnitude of the motor response) following levodopa. This improvement was not reflected in the daily motor situation of patients. Dyskinesias remained unchanged. Gabapentin was well tolerated. Further studies are needed to know the impact of these results in the long-term.
Liver transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with a high rate of graft loss and poor survival, unless re-infection can be prevented. Human hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) has long been utilized to prevent re-infection. More recently, an anti-viral agent has been utilized along with HBIG. However, the regimens utilized have varied considerably among LT programmes and the optimal regimen has never been defined. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 41 patients who underwent LT for HBV at our centre since 1985 and received either HBIG with or without an anti-viral agent. The mean age of these patients was 46 years; 81% were male and 88% white. The mean and maximal follow-up were 5.9 and 15 years respectively. Eight out of 15 E-antigen-positive patients who received HBIG alone developed recurrence after a mean of 17 months. In contrast, none of 10 E-Ag-negative patients who received HBIG alone and none of the 10 E-antigen-positive patients who received both HBIG and either lamivudine or adefovir developed recurrence. As long as the anti-HB surface remained detectable, no absolute minimum serum level appeared to lead to recurrent HBV. We concluded that recurrence of HBV following LT can be prevented in E-antigen-positive patients with a combination of HBIG and an anti-viral agent. In contrast, recurrence can be prevented in E-antigen-negative patients with HBIG alone. Maintaining a serum anti-HB surface level above a minimum arbitrary titre of 200 pg/mL did not appear to be necessary for effective HBIG prophylaxis.
We have shown that a sodium ionophore monensin inhibits prostate cancer cell growth. A structurally related compound to monensin, salinomycin, was recently identified as a putative cancer stem cell inhibitor.
The growth inhibitory potential of salinomycin was studied in a panel of prostate cells. To get insights into the mechanism of action, a variety of assays such as gene expression and steroid profiling were performed in salinomycin-exposed prostate cancer cells.
Salinomycin inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells, but did not affect non-malignant prostate epithelial cells. Salinomycin impacted on prostate cancer stem cell functions as evidenced by reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and the fraction of CD44(+) cells. Moreover, salinomycin reduced the expression of MYC, AR and ERG, induced oxidative stress as well as inhibited nuclear factor-κB activity and cell migration. Furthermore, profiling steroid metabolites revealed increased levels of oxidative stress-inducing steroids 7-ketocholesterol and aldosterone and decreased levels of antioxidative steroids progesterone and pregnenolone in salinomycin-exposed prostate cancer cells.
Our results indicate that salinomycin inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and migration by reducing the expression of key prostate cancer oncogenes, inducing oxidative stress, decreasing the antioxidative capacity and cancer stem cell fraction.
To investigate the impact of exogenous beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation on splanchnic blood flow, oxygen kinetics, glucose-precursor flux, and liver metabolism in septic shock.
Prospective trial.
University hospital intensive care unit.
Six patients with hyperdynamic (cardiac index >4.0 L/min/m2) septic shock, all requiring norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure >65 mm Hg.
We compared norepinephrine and phenylephrine titrated to achieve similar systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange. Splanchnic hemodynamics, oxygen kinetics, and metabolic parameters were measured before, during, and after replacing norepinephrine with phenylephrine.
Splanchnic blood flow and oxygen kinetics were derived from the steady-state indocyanine-green clearance based on hepatic dye extraction and arterial and hepatic venous blood gases. Endogenous glucose production rate was derived from the plasma appearance rate of stable-isotope-labeled glucose using a primed-constant infusion. Splanchnic lactate, alanine (high-performance liquid chromatography) uptake, and hepatic monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) (fluorescence polarization immunoassay) formation rates were calculated from splanchnic blood flow and arterial-hepatic venous concentration differences. Replacing norepinephrine with phenylephrine induced no change in systemic hemodynamics or gas exchange. While splanchnic oxygen consumption and alanine uptake rate remained unaffected, splanchnic blood flow, oxygen delivery, and lactate uptake rate were significantly decreased. Glucose production rate also decreased significantly. A return to norepinephrine restored splanchnic blood flow, oxygen delivery, and lactate uptake rate to baseline values, while glucose production rate remained depressed. Hepatic MEGX formation rate was not influenced during the investigation.
Exogenous beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation determines splanchnic blood flow, oxygen delivery, and glucose precursor flux but not splanchnic oxygen utilization in septic shock. Gluconeogenesis is not directly affiliated to hepatosplanchnic oxygen kinetics. The different response of glucose and MEGX production rates, metabolic pathways of the periportal and perivenous region, may document intrahepatic heterogeneity associated with hepatocellular metabolic compartmentation.
Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive drug with potent antifibrotic activity. We evaluated the effect of rapamycin on murine adriamycin nephropathy, a model of progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.
Adriamycin nephropathy was induced in Balb/c mice by a single intravenous injection of adriamycin. The mice were treated orally with either saline or rapamycin, beginning at the time of adriamycin injection or rapamycin starting 1 week after adriamycin injection. The mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after adriamycin injection.
Saline-treated mice developed massive proteinuria and impaired renal function. Kidney sections from saline-treated mice showed marked focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubular dilation with protein cast deposition, interstitial fibrosis, and numerous infiltrating macrophages and T lymphocytes. The intrarenal expression of Collagen I and RANTES was also increased. In contrast, both groups of rapamycin-treated mice had markedly reduced proteinuria and preserved renal function, with only mild histological abnormalities. The intrarenal expression of Collagen I and RANTES was reduced, concomitant with a significant reduction in interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration.
Rapamycin is effective in attenuating the glomerular and tubulointerstitial abnormalities in adriamycin nephropathy. The beneficial effects of rapamycin are mediated, at least in part, through reduced RANTES expression and inflammatory cell infiltration.
A 40-year-old man with severe psoriasis developed painless muscle stiffness coinciding with four successive courses of etretinate therapy. Peripheral nerve block extinguished the increased muscle tone. Our patient's symptoms resembled those of the stiff-man syndrome. Increased muscle tone is a potential side effect of etretinate treatment and must be distinguished from the common musculoskeletal symptoms observed in patients taking retinoid therapy.
Fetal bradycardia and decreased heart rate variability can indicate a nonreassuring fetal status. However, there can be iatrogenic, physiologic, or pathologic causes.
A patient in premature labor received toxic levels of magnesium sulfate for tocolysis. Elevated maternal serum magnesium levels correlated inversely with maternal temperature and both fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability. There was also a relative decrease of the maternal heart rate from baseline. When the magnesium levels returned to normal, these vital signs returned to normal.
Magnesium sulfate therapy can result in maternal hypothermia and a decrease in fetal heart rate and heart rate variability. Maternal hypothermia might be the cause of fetal bradycardia. A direct action of magnesium on the fetal heart might be the cause of heart rate variability.
Undetectable or very low unconjugated estriol (E3) levels in routine maternal serum screening are associated with steroid sulfatase deficiency, miscarriages, and anencephaly.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques were used in the diagnosis of steroid sulfatase deficiency prenatally in three cases with low or undetectable unconjugated E3 levels. Results showed a male fetus with a deleted steroid sulfatase region, but intact Kallmann syndrome region in all three cases. One mother was studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization and showed a similar deletion for steroid sulfatase gene in one copy of X chromosome (carrier).
Women with undetectable or very low levels of estriol on serum screening should be counseled regarding steroid sulfatase deficiency with evaluation by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
The effect of dose frequency on fluoxetine efficacy and safety was evaluated in a double-blind study in patients with major depressive disorder. The patients received fluoxetine once a day (in the morning) or twice a day (in the morning and at noon). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the mean measures of efficacy, all of which showed significant improvement over baseline (p less than .001). Adverse experience profiles were not significantly different, with nervousness/anxiety predominating in both groups. In the subsequent 48-week open-label study, the percentage of patients reporting adverse experiences decreased greatly.
The neuropeptides neurokinin B, neurotensin, and anandamide, the endogenous ligands of NK3, NT1, and CB1 receptors respectively, are known to interact with brain dopaminergic transmission. This study evaluated the effects of these three antagonists of the NK3 (SR 142801), neurotensin (SR 48692), and cannabinoid (SR 141716) receptors on the severity of motor symptoms and levodopa-induced dyskinesias after administration of a single dose of levodopa in 24 patients with Parkinson disease. In this exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, at the dose used, the drugs tested were well tolerated and could not improve parkinsonian motor disability.
