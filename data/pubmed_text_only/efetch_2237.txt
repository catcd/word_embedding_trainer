To investigate the prevalence and prognosis of visual field defects (VFDs) in epilepsy patients with and without vigabatrin (VGB) treatment; to investigate the possible relationship between VFDs and cumulative VGB dose, and to characterise the evolution of VFDs.
A cohort of 155 presurgical candidates who had undergone full-field Goldmann perimetry (GP) was studied, 99 (64%) of whom had been treated with VGB. All GPs were reevaluated in 1998 by one experienced examiner, blinded to medication. Duration of treatment and total VGB dose were related to perimetric results.
Twenty-five (16%) of the 155 patients had VFDs: Nineteen (19%) of the 99 VGB-treated patients, and six (11%) of the 56 patients unexposed to VGB. VGB-treated patients with VFDs had been treated significantly longer than those without VFDs. Cumulative VGB dose could be calculated for 84 patients. The prevalence of VFDs increased significantly with increasing total VGB-dose, from 4% in the 51 patients who had been exposed to <or=1 kg VGB, to 75% in the eight patients with a total dose of 3-5 kg of VGB. Sixteen VGB-treated patients were reexamined 2-10 years later. In the 12 where evaluation was possible, all still had VFDs, which had worsened in five cases (42%) and improved in none.
This study indicates a strong relationship between VFDs and duration and total dose of VGB. VFDs were irreversible and in a substantial percentage progressive. Similar VFDs may, however, also be found in patients unexposed to VGB. A model of the evolution of the VFDs in VGB toxicity is introduced, and a new simple visual field test is proposed.
We have established new human sarcoma lines and examined their sensitivity to common antitumor drugs and expression of putative multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins. Eighty-two sarcoma samples were transplanted in nude mice. Fourteen of these sarcomas were established as tumor cell lines. We determined a chemosensitivity profile to antitumor drugs (MDR drugs = doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and vincristine; non-MDR drugs = cisplatin, ifosfamide, and bleomycin) for each tumor line in vivo. Response to chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide was observed in 30-50% of these tumor lines. Our results obtained with xenotransplants are similar to the results documented in clinical trials in which doxorubicin and ifosfamide are effective in 30-50% of the patients. Furthermore, we examined expression of MDR-relevant markers like P-glycoprotein, MDR-associated protein, lung resistance protein, and mdr1 mRNA in these xenotransplants. A relationship between mdr1 mRNA expression and response to doxorubicin was demonstrated in >90% of our tumor lines. In six sarcomas with mdr1 mRNA expression, five were resistant against doxorubicin and cross-resistant against several other drugs, whereas from eight sarcomas, which lacked detectable mdr1 mRNA, seven were sensitive to doxorubicin and other drugs. We found lung resistance protein or MDR-associated protein expressed in three resistant and mdr1 mRNA-positive sarcomas. These results demonstrate that mdr1 mRNA expression is a putative marker for drug resistance in our sarcoma lines. We conclude, therefore, that inherent P-glycoprotein expression might be also responsible for drug resistance occurring in treatment of patients with sarcomas. The established tumor lines are useful for additional investigations on mechanisms of drug resistance in sarcomas and as models for preclinical screening of new antitumor drugs.
A freebase cocaine-smoking woman developed relapsing fever, bronchoconstriction, arthralgias and weight loss. Pulmonary infiltrates, arthritis, microhaematuria, pruriginous skin rash and mononeuritis multiplex were later added to the clinical picture. Both skin and muscle biopsies showed eosinophilic angiitis. Improvement or worsening of her clinical picture repeatedly coincided with avoidance or use of smoked cocaine, respectively. We suggest that Churg-Strauss vasculitis may be a complication of smoking freebase cocaine.
Flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is cytotoxic to leukemic blasts. In a Phase II study, flavopiridol 50 mg/m(2) was given by 1-h infusion daily x 3 beginning day 1 followed by 2 g/m(2)/72 h ara-C beginning day 6 and 40 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone on day 9 (FLAM) to 45 adults with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with multiple poor-risk features. Thirty patients (67%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 4 (9%) died. Twelve (40%) received myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in first CR. Median OS and DFS are not reached (67% alive 12.5-31 months, 58% in CR 11.4-30 months), with median follow-up 22 months. Sixteen received FLAM in CR, with median OS and DFS 9 and 13.1 months, and 36% alive at 21-31 months. Short OS and DFS correlated with adverse cytogenetics, regardless of age or treatment in CR. The addition of allogeneic BMT in CR translates into long OS and DFS in the majority of eligible patients.
To evaluate the potential of proteasome inhibitors, a novel class of antitumor agents, for the treatment of retinoblastoma. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma, is being studied for the treatment of several other malignancies. Among other effects, it inactivates the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by blocking the degradation of its inhibitor, IkappaB. NF-kappaB, which is constitutively active in human retinoblastoma cells and promotes their survival, represents a therapeutic target for patients with this malignancy.
The authors evaluated the effect of bortezomib on the retinoblastoma cell lines Y79 and WERI-Rb1 in vitro using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry with propidium iodide, gene expression profiling, RT-PCR, and immunoblotting.
Bortezomib induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in both retinoblastoma cell lines at clinically achievable concentrations. Bortezomib upregulated heat-shock proteins, other stress-response proteins, proapoptotic molecules, cell-cycle regulators, transcription factors, cytokines, and several proteasome subunits and solute carrier proteins, whereas it downregulated antiapoptotic and adhesion molecules. Bortezomib also induced cleavage of caspases, Bid and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and sensitized retinoblastoma cells to doxorubicin.
Bortezomib induces a stress response and triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis in human retinoblastoma cells at clinically achievable concentrations. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism(s) of the antitumor activity of bortezomib and a basis for future preclinical studies leading to clinical trials of bortezomib, alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy, to improve patient outcomes in retinoblastoma.
Valproic acid is widely used as a mood stabilizer. We report a case of an adult with bipolar disorder taking therapeutic doses of valproic acid, who presented to the emergency department with coma related to hyperammonemia as a complication of valproic acid treatment. Valproic acid was discontinued which resulted in rapid clinical recovery. Valproic acid induced coma was likely related to a urea cycle enzymopathy. Clinicians should consider hyperammonemia in all patients who present with coma and other mental status changes while on valproic acid. In such patients, ammonia level should be obtained in addition to liver function tests.
Because amphetamine releases two to three times more dopamine in schizophrenia patients than in control subjects, and because calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II has a key role in the enhanced action of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in rats, the synaptic content of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIbeta mRNA was measured (by quantitative competitive RT-PCR; reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) in seven frontal cerebral cortices of post-mortem brains from patients who had schizophrenia and in seven control tissues. The results indicate that the mRNA of this kinase is elevated in the schizophrenia frontal cortex.
Autosomal-dominant brachydactyly type E (BDE) is a congenital limb malformation characterized by small hands and feet predominantly as a result of shortened metacarpals and metatarsals. In a large pedigree with BDE, short stature, and learning disabilities, we detected a microdeletion of approximately 900 kb encompassing PTHLH, the gene coding for parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHRP). PTHRP is known to regulate the balance between chondrocyte proliferation and the onset of hypertrophic differentiation during endochondral bone development. Inactivation of Pthrp in mice results in short-limbed dwarfism because of premature differentiation of chondrocyte. On the basis of our initial finding, we tested further individuals with BDE and short stature for mutations in PTHLH. We identified two missense (L44P and L60P), a nonstop (X178WextX( *)54), and a nonsense (K120X) mutation. The missense mutation L60P was tested in chicken micromass culture with the replication-competent avian sarcoma leukosis virus retroviral expression system and was shown to result in a loss of function. Thus, loss-of-function mutations in PTHLH cause BDE with short stature.
Alterations in the intracellular signal transduction pathway in primary afferents may contribute to pain hypersensitivity. Recently, we have reported that the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) occurs in primary afferent neurons in response to noxious stimulation of the peripheral tissue, i.e., activity-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. In the present study, we investigated the phosphorylation of ERK5, also known as big MAPK1, in the DRG by noxious stimulation using immunohistochemistry. Capsaicin injection induced phosphorylated ERK5 (p-ERK5) in small-to-medium diameter sensory neurons with a peak at 2 min after capsaicin injection. Furthermore, we examined the p-ERK5 labeling in the DRG after noxious heat and cold stimuli and found a stimulus intensity-dependent increase in the number of activated neurons. Most of these p-ERK5-immunoreactive neurons were small- and medium-sized neurons, which coexpressed transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel TRPV1 and TRPA1 after noxious heat and cold stimuli, respectively. In contrast, there was no change in ERK5 phosphorylation in the spinal dorsal horn. The i.t. administration of ERK5 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide reversed heat hyperalgesia, but not mechanical allodynia, produced by capsaicin injection. Taken together, these findings suggest that the in vivo activation of the ERK5 signaling pathway in sensory neurons by noxious stimulation may be, at least in part, correlated with functional activity and, further, involved in the development of pain hypersensitivity.
(1) When drug treatment is indicated for erectile dysfunction, sildenafil is the first line oral treatment. Overall, about half of patients with erectile dysfunction can achieve satisfactory penetrative sex with sildenafil. (2) Apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, is now licensed in France for treatment of erectile dysfunction. It is available as sublingual tablets of 2 mg and 3 mg. (3) The evaluation dossier contains no data comparing apomorphine with sildenafil. Dose-finding studies and placebo-controlled trials in patients without a serious organic disorder show that about 90% consider the 2 mg dose of apomorphine to be insufficient. The 3-mg tablets are hardly more effective. Nearly 90% of patients prefer a dose of at least 4 mg. (4) The main side effects of sublingual apomorphine are nausea, dizziness, severe sweating and drowsiness. These effects are dose-dependent. Syncope and hypotension are also relatively common. Serious consequences of these side effects were reported during some clinical trials. (5) The safety profile of sublingual apomorphine is no better than that of sildenafil. Both drugs interact with nitrates, increasing the risk of hypotension. (6) In practice, sildenafil remains the first line treatment for men with erectile dysfunction.
There has been widespread speculation that patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may become drug dependent if their painful crisis is treated with narcotics. However, there has been no scientific evidence to support this assertion. Paradoxically, individuals suffering from sickle cell disease who are not adequately treated may develop an addiction to narcotics due to self-medication to treat their pain. In this article, we describe a 38-year-old African American woman who became addicted to cocaine due to self-medication of her sickle cell pain with cocaine.
A number of cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease taking oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).
To evaluate the effects of 9 months of therapy with mesalazine or olsalazine on renal function in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission.
Forty patients with ulcerative colitis in complete remission for 6 months were randomized to either olsalazine (n=20) or mesalazine (n=20 for nine months). Thirty-six of the 40 patients were on prior salicylate therapy. Disease activity was the measure ofclinical efficacy and was assessed by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI). Laboratory efficacy measurements included glomerular filtration rate (GFR), microalbuminuria, urinary gluthathione S-transferase (GST) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP). Safety analysis consisted of documentation of adverse events and laboratory values.
There was no significant reduction in the GFR overall on therapy. The levels of GFR adjusted for baseline were similar in the two treatment groups after 3, 6 and 9 months. A significantly higher percentage of mesalazine-treated patients experienced drug related adverse events, all of a minor nature. The incidence of adverse events causing early withdrawal was similar in the two treatment groups.
Treatment with mesalazine or olsalazine for 9 months had no significant impact on GFR.
Immunosuppressive therapy related secondary haematologic malignancy is well reported. A 52 years lady with established rheumatoid arthritis developed reactive amyloidosis. This was initially treated with colchicine and cyclophosphamide and later with chlorambucil. Ten months after stopping chlorambucil she developed pancytopenia and vitamin B12 deficient megaloblastic anaemia. The pancytopenia was refractory to vitamin B12 supplements and a repeat bone marrow confirmed myelodysplasia (FABI RAEB-T). Within three weeks of this diagnosis she evolved into acute myeloid leukaemia and expired due to refractory thrombocytopenia and uncontrolled bleeding. This case stresses the need for long term follow up of RA patients treated with alkylating agents.
A 22-year-old female presented with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) resulted in a severe exacerbation of the coagulopathy 5 days after its introduction. This was complicated by bone marrow necrosis, parenchymal liver damage and acute tubular necrosis. Temporary cessation of the drug and subsequent dose reduction was effective in controlling the coagulopathy.
Two out of 20 patients treated for metastatic or non-metastatic breast cancer with tamoxifen (20 mg 2 dd) developed bilateral secondary tapetoretinal degeneration. In one patient in whom the medication was stopped there was still slight progression of degeneration afterwards. In the other patient tamoxifen was continued under strict ophthalmological control. The total doses have been 7.3 g and 43.8 g respectively.
To report a case of felbamate (FBM) urolithiasis.
Urographic imaging [sonography, abdominal computed tomography (CT), intravenous pyelogram, voiding cystourethrogram] and urologic procedures (cystoscopy with lithotripsy, ureteral stent) to define and capture the stones. Stone identification was by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
A 15-year-old boy had painful hematuria, bilateral ureteral obstruction, and urinary retention. Kidney, bladder, and ureteral stones were found, and ureteral stent placement was required to relieve obstruction. The stone material was identified as FBM by chemical analysis. Stone formation ceased with discontinuation of FBM.
FBM urolithiasis can occur, and possible contributory factors include high felbamate dosage, drug polypharmacy, and risk factors for forming stones of other types. FBM urolithiasis may be heralded by crystalluria.
We analyzed the effects of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) inhibitor 3,5-diamino-6-chloro-N-(diaminomethylidene)pyrazine-2-carboxamide hydrochloride (amiloride) and its analogs 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA) and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of prostaglandin (PG) E2 in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse macrophage-like cell line RAW 264, these inhibitors suppressed the LPS (1 microg/ml)-induced production of PGE2 at 8 h in a concentration-dependent manner. They also reduced the LPS-induced release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids at 4 h and the LPS-induced increase in the level of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein at 6 h, but not the level of COX-2 mRNA at 3 h. The LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and degradation of inhibitor of kappaB-alpha were not inhibited by these drugs. In an air pouch-type LPS-induced inflammation model in mice 30 mg/kg amiloride and 10 mg/kg EIPA as well as the COX inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg), significantly reduced the level of PGE2 in the pouch fluid at 8 h and the vascular permeability from 4 to 8 h. The accumulation of pouch fluid and leukocytes in the pouch fluid at 8 h was significantly inhibited by amiloride and EIPA but not by indomethacin. These findings suggested that the NHE inhibitors suppress the production of PGE2 through inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid and the increase in COX-2 protein levels and thus induce anti-inflammatory activity.
The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled multicenter trial, evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin over 48 weeks in 8,245 patients with moderately severe hypercholesterolemia. During year 1 of follow-up of the full cohort, lovastatin at 20 or 40 mg/day, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily, produced dose-dependent decreases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglyceride levels (10% to 19%), and increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (6.6% to 9.5%). In all, 977 patients continued their original blinded treatment for an additional year. In year 2, the LDL cholesterol response to lovastatin was maintained, the triglyceride reductions were somewhat less, and the increases in HDL cholesterol were moderately greater than in year 1. Successive transaminase elevations > 3 times the upper limit of normal were observed in only 1 patient in year 2, yielding a cumulative 2-year incidence of from 0.1% (placebo or lovastatin 20 mg/day) to 1.9% (lovastatin 80 mg/day). Myopathy occurred in only 1 patient during year 2, and over the 2-year study was observed rarely and only at lovastatin dosages of 40 and 80 mg/day. This study indicates that lovastatin maintains its efficacy over long-term follow-up, particularly in effectively lowering LDL cholesterol, is generally well tolerated, and has a favorable safety profile.
Thoracic aneurysms are the main cardiovascular complication of Marfan syndrome (MFS) resulting in premature death. MFS has been associated with mutations of the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a major constituent of the elastic fibers. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms but their precise role in MFS is not clear. Doxycycline is a nonspecific MMP inhibitor. The objective of the study was to determine whether docycycline can attenuate matrix degradation and prolong the survival of mice with MFS.
The study employed a well-characterized animal model of MFS, namely fibrillin-1 under-expressing mice (mgR/mgR mice) that die spontaneously from rupture of the thoracic aorta between 2 to 4 months of age. Mutant and wild type mice were given doxycycline in their drinking water at a concentration designed to provide 100 mg/kg/day beginning at postnatal day (PD) 1, whereas control mice were given water. Treated mice were divided into two groups. One group of animals was followed until death or for 7 months to determine lifespan. In the second group of mice, the ascending thoracic aortas were collected for histological analysis (H&E staining, trichrome staining) and zymography for examining MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels at 6 weeks.
MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were higher in the thoracic aorta of mgR/mgR mice compared with wild type littermates. Doxycycline-treated mgR/mgR mice lived 132 +/- 14.6 days (n = 16) or significantly longer than untreated mutant mice (79 +/- 6.7 days, n = 30) (P < 0.01). Connective tissue staining showed that doxycycline treatment decreased elastic fiber degradation in mgR/mgR mice. Furthermore, mgR/mgR mice treated with doxycycline had lower MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels compared with untreated mgR/mgR mice.
This study demonstrates that doxycycline significantly delays aneurysm rupture in MFS-like mice by inhibiting expression of tissue MMP-2 and MMP-9 and thus, degradation of the elastic matrix. The results suggest that MMPs contribute to the progression of thoracic aneurysm in MFS and that doxycycline has the potential to significantly alter the course of the disease.
A randomized prospective trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of ritodrine and indomethacin in the long-term treatment of preterm labor. Forty patients with intact membranes in preterm labor at 23 to 34 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive either intravenous ritodrine or oral indomethacin as the first-line tocolytic agent. Successful intravenous ritodrine therapy was followed by oral terbutaline therapy, and indomethacin-treated patients continued to receive oral indomethacin. Treatment failures were defined as progressive preterm labor or patient intolerance, and these patients were treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate. Ritodrine and indomethacin were equally successful in delaying preterm birth as defined by interval to delivery, gestational age at delivery, delivery delayed greater than 7 days, attainment of 35 weeks of gestation, percentage of patients who required magnesium sulfate therapy, percentage of patients who were readmitted with premature rupture of membranes, absence of recurrent preterm labor, and infant birth weight. More than 80% of mothers who received ritodrine voiced complaints of beta-sympathomimetic side effects, and one patient discontinued treatment as the result of intolerance. There were minimal patient complaints with indomethacin use. No statistically significant differences were noted in neonatal outcome as defined by Apgar scores, umbilical cord pH, intensive care days, ventilator days, or neonatal deaths. However, three cases of primary pulmonary hypertension were observed in the indomethacin group. We had not previously observed this problem with short-term (24 to 48 hours) indomethacin therapy.
In vitro, p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) phosphorylates the serine 305 residue of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and influences the response of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. We investigated the influence of Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) on breast cancer prognosis and results of tamoxifen therapy.
We examined Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) protein by immunohistochemistry in a series of 912 tumors from node-negative breast cancer patients randomized to tamoxifen or no adjuvant endocrine treatment.
Cytoplasmic Pak1 correlated to large tumors and ER negativity, whereas nuclear Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) correlated to small tumors and ER positivity. Nuclear expression of Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) predicted reduced response to tamoxifen in patients with ERalpha-positive tumors (tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen: hazard ratio (HR), 1.33; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.42-4.2; P = 0.63), whereas patients lacking this combination benefitted significantly from tamoxifen (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30-0.62; P < 0.0001). Similar nonsignificant trends were detected in analyses of the proteins separately. Pak1 in the cytoplasm was an independent prognostic marker, indicating increased recurrence rate (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.17-2.74; P = 0.0068) and breast cancer mortality (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.14-3.46; P = 0.016) for patients randomized to no adjuvant treatment.
Our results suggest that patients with tumors expressing Pak1 and pERalpha(ser305) in combination are a group in which tamoxifen treatment is insufficient. In addition, the pathway may be of interest as a drug target in breast cancer. Furthermore, the findings support previous studies showing that Pak1 has differential roles in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
Haloperidol has long been used to manage agitation in dementia, but it is associated with increased side effects. We report the first case of a patient with severe Alzheimer's disease who presented with non-epileptic myoclonus just after haloperidol treatment was initiated.
Synaptic plasticity is thought to be a key mechanism of information storage in the CNS. Different forms of synaptic long-term potentiation have been shown to be impaired in neurological disorders. Here, we show that metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD), but not NMDA receptor-dependent LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, is profoundly impaired after status epilepticus. Brief application of the group I mGluR agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (100 microM; 5 min) induced mGluR LTD in control, but not in pilocarpine-treated rats. Experiments in the presence of selective inhibitors of either mGluR5 [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine] or mGluR1 [7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropachromen-carboxylate ethyl ester and (S)-(+)-alpha-amino-4-carboxy-2-methylbenzeneacetic acid] demonstrate that loss of mGluR LTD is most likely attributable to a loss of mGluR5 function. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR revealed a specific downregulation of mGluR5 mRNA, but not of mGluR1 mRNA in the CA1 region. Furthermore, we detected a strong reduction in mGluR5 protein expression by immunofluorescence and quantitative immunoblotting. Additionally, the scaffolding protein Homer that mediates coupling of mGluR5 to downstream signaling cascades was downregulated. Thus, we conclude that the reduction of mGluR LTD after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus is the result of the subtype-specific downregulation of mGluR5 and associated downstream signaling components.
To assess the role of spinal dopamine receptors in mediation of hypotension induced by systemic administration of the dopamine D2 receptor agonist, bromocriptine, conscious deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats were pretreated with either intravenous (i.v.; 500 micrograms/kg) or intrathecal (i.t.; 40 micrograms/rat at T9-T10) domperidone, a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. In DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, i.v. administration of a sub-maximal dose of bromocriptine (150 micrograms/kg) induced a significant decrease in mean aortic pressure (MAP) which was greater and longer lasting than that in uninephrectomized control rats. Intravenous or i.t. pretreatment with domperidone reduced partially, but significantly, the hypotensive effect of bromocriptine (reduction of about 57% and 45% of the maximal effect, respectively). The remaining responses observed during the 60 min postinjection period were still statistically significant as compared with vehicle injection. In contrast, the bromocriptine-induced hypotension was fully abolished by i.v. pretreatment with metoclopramide (300 micrograms/kg), a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier, or by combined pretreatment with i.v. and i.t. domperidone. These results suggest that, in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, the hypotension induced by i.v. bromocriptine is mediated partly through a peripheral D2 dopaminergic mechanism and partly through stimulation of spinal dopamine D2 receptors, has been demonstrated in conscious normotensive rats.
A 69-year-old man presenting with choreo-athetosis was proved to have primary Sjögren's syndrome. Choreo-athetosis suddenly appeared in the bilateral legs and the right arm; it was predominant in the right limbs. On the neurological examinations, there was no abnormal finding except for this involuntary movement. Brain MRI showed no abnormal finding. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET revealed that glucose metabolism was relatively increased in the bilateral striatum and thalamus (left side dominant). Dry eye and thirst were present for 4 years, and a diagnosis of primary Sjögren syndrome was confirmed by ophthalmological examinations, lip biopsy and sialography. Choreo-athetosis disappeared after thioridazine hydrochloride was started, while steroid was not effective.
