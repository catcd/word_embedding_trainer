Milnacipran is a new antidepressive drug, a combined noradrenaline/serotonin (NA/5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, which has been suggested to be as effective as and better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants. Since long-term studies are lacking, we compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of milnacipran and clomipramine in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study setting during 26 weeks of treatment in patients with major depression. A total of 107 patients were treated with either milnacipran (n=52) or clomipramine (n=55). Due to active treatment of duration less than 12 days in four patients and protocol deviation in one patient, in total 47 milnacipran-treated patients were eligible for efficacy analysis. Nine patients in the clomipramine group continued on active treatment for less than 12 days. Thus 46 clomipramine-treated patients were finally included in the efficacy analysis. After 1 week of dose escalation, there was a fixed dosage regimen of either milnacipran (200 mg daily) or clomipramine (150 mg daily) during weeks 2 to 10, followed by flexible dosing of milnacipran (100, 150 or 200 mg daily) or clomipramine (75, 100 or 150 mg daily) during weeks 11 to 26. A total of 53 patients (49%) completed the 26-week study period; 21% (11/52) of the patients in the milnacipran group and 38% (21/55) of the patients in the clomipramine group discontinued their medication prematurely due to adverse events, whereas 19% (10/52) of those on milnacipran and 7% (4/55) of those on clomipramine treatment withdrew due to either lack of efficacy or clinical deterioration. The mean change (+/-SD) in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score between the baseline and the last rating ranged from 23.7+/-3.1 to 12.0+/-9.5 in the milnacipran-treated patients and from 23.1+/-3.5 to 8.0+/-8.5 in the clomipramine-treated patients, revealing a significant difference in favour of clomipramine. In total 58% of the milnacipran-treated patients vs. 72% of the clomipramine-treated patients showed a > or = 50% reduction in their baseline HAMD scores and 45% vs. 63% had an HAMD score of < or = 7 at the last rating, respectively. Moreover, the time to the onset of the antidepressant action (defined as > or = 50% reduction of the baseline HAMD score) showed a significant difference in favour of clomipramine. In addition, clomipramine was significantly more efficacious in patients with a baseline HAMD score of > or = 24 as evidenced by the analysis of the HAMD score at week 6 and at the last rating. The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale did not show significant differences between the treatment groups. The safety analysis did not reveal any differences of clinical significance in cardiovascular variables between the study drugs. Dry mouth was significantly less frequently reported by the milnacipran-treated patients during the early and later phases (weeks 6 to 26) of the study, while insomnia was more common in the milnacipran group during weeks 1 to 6. In conclusion, milnacipran appeared to be less effective than clomipramine in the long-term treatment of depression. The side-effects of the drugs differed to a certain extent, and milnacipran tended to be somewhat better tolerated than clomipramine.
A 57-year-old man was admitted with hemorrhagic papules and necrotising nodules on both elbows and upper legs. Recurrent arthralgia occurred.
The skin biopsy showed a cutaneous necrotising vasculitis. Positive test results for c-ANCA and proteinase 3 antibodies and a slightly increased WBC and a mild proteinuria were noticeable.
The diagnosis of an early systemic Wegener's granulomatosis was based on elevated proteinase 3-titres and cutaneous histologic findings as necrotising vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation. Treatment with prednisolone followed by methotrexate resolved the cutaneous symptoms and the arthralgia completely. Three months later the patient developed a progredient methotrexate toxicity caused by a glomerulonephritis.
Wegener's granulomatosis should be considered if a cutaneous necrotising vasculitis is diagnosed. A cutaneous manifestation could be an early symptom. Methotrexate could be used for treatment of mild courses of Wegener's disease without renal involvement.
The effect of chronic high doses of d-amphetamine on amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior in guinea pigs was studied in an attempt to determine the mechanism involved in the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in parkinsonism. Prolonged pretreatment with suprathreshold doses of amphetamine decreased the threshold dosage of both amphetamine and apomorphine necessary to elicit stereotyped behavior. This suggests that chronic striatal dopamine stimulation may induce striatal dopamine receptor site hypersensitivity and that this type of induced hypersensitivity may play a role in the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. This mechanism may also play a role in the development of amphetamine-induced chorea and psychosis.
Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are associated with the therapeutic response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The response rate to these drugs remains low, however, in NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR alleles. Combination therapies with EGFR-TKIs and cytotoxic agents are considered a therapeutic option for patients with NSCLC expressing wild-type EGFR. We investigated the antiproliferative effect of the combination of the oral fluorouracil S-1 and the EGFR-TKI gefitinib in NSCLC cells of differing EGFR status. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and gefitinib showed a synergistic antiproliferative effect in vitro in all NSCLC cell lines tested. Combination chemotherapy with S-1 and gefitinib in vivo also had a synergistic antitumor effect on NSCLC xenografts regardless of the absence or presence of EGFR mutations. Gefitinib inhibited the expression of the transcription factor E2F-1, resulting in the down-regulation of thymidylate synthase at the mRNA and protein levels. These observations suggest that gefitinib-induced down-regulation of thymidylate synthase is responsible, at least in part, for the synergistic antitumor effect of combined treatment with S-1 and gefitinib and provide a basis for clinical evaluation of combination chemotherapy with S-1 and EGFR-TKIs in patients with solid tumors.
Cocaine fistulae require repair with well-vascularized material. In the technique used this is accomplished by closure of the nasal layer by delayed palatal flaps and the oral layer with a tongue flap. Three cases are presented.
Around 9% of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are resistant to azathioprine. We hypothesized that these patients may carry mutations within inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). To test this hypothesis, we screened 20 azathioprine-resistant patients for variations in the two IMPDH genes (IMPDH1 and IMPDH2) using dHPLC and DNA sequencing. A 9 bp insertion within the IMPDH1 P3 promoter was found in a patient exhibiting severe azathioprine resistance. The insertion is predicted to abolish a cAMP-response element (CRE) and was found to significantly reduce IMPDH1 P3 promoter activity in a luciferase reporter gene assay (P-value <0.001). This in vitro assay suggests the variant promoter has altered function in vivo and consequently may have contributed to the thiopurine resistance observed in this patient. The absence of functional variants within the other patients indicates that if IMPDH genetic variability contributes to azathioprine resistance it does so infrequently.
Red cell aplasia developed in a case of Wilson's disease following an increase in D-penicillamine dosage after 14 years' treatment. In vitro study of the effect of D-penicillamine on 59Fe incorporation by marrow cells did not suggest that the patient's erythropoiesis was particularly sensitive to D-penicillamine or determine the mechanism of drug toxicity. However, three weeks after the drug was withdrawn, evidence of marrow regeneration was apparent, and within 10 weeks the haemoglobin had returned to normal. The patient has subsequently remained asymptomatic on an alternative chelating agent, triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride.
An 18-year-old man with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was prescribed varenicline for smoking cessation. He quit smoking after 1 week of therapy and remained smoke free for the next 17 days. During that time, he had also been taking amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall) on work days for his ADHD. Because his supply of amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was diminishing, he took only half (30 mg every morning) of his prescribed dosage from days 4-12 of varenicline therapy. He further reduced his dosage to 15 mg every morning on days 13 and 14 of varenicline therapy, and his supply of amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was depleted on day 15. On day 23 of varenicline therapy, he received and filled a new prescription for amphetamine-dextroamphetamine and resumed his prescribed dosage (30 mg twice/day). He began smoking again within 48 hours. Rechallenge with varenicline while the patient continued to receive amphetamine-dextroamphetamine yielded similar results. Data suggest that addition of amphetamine to varenicline may negate the partial agonism of varenicline, resulting in elimination of the smoking-cessation aid's benefits. Other potential mechanisms for the drug interaction may also exist. Thus, varenicline may not aid smoking cessation in patients undergoing treatment with amphetamine and amphetamine-like drugs.
In this report, we demonstrate that chronic prenatal exposure to a moderate dose of caffeine disrupts novel object recognition and radial arm maze behaviors in adult male and female rats. Pregnant dams were administered either tap water or 75 mg/L caffeinated tap water throughout gestation. Oral self-administration in the drinking water led to an approximate maternal intake of 10mg/kg/day, equivalent to 2-3 cups of coffee/day in humans based on a metabolic body weight conversion. In adulthood, the offspring underwent testing on novel object recognition, radial arm maze, and Morris water maze tasks. Prenatal caffeine exposure was found to impair 24-h memory retention in the novel object recognition task and impair both working and reference memory in the radial arm maze. However, prenatal caffeine exposure did not alter Morris water maze performance in either a simple water maze procedure or in an advanced water maze procedure that included reversal and working memory paradigms. These findings demonstrate that chronic oral intake of caffeine throughout gestation can alter adult cognitive behaviors in rats.
A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP. They were then treated chronically with L-DOPA/benserazide 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months. This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested dyskinesia. A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified. Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology. However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements. Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia. Atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea.
Interferon therapy can induce or exacerbate sarcoidosis. With the increasing use of interferons it is highly likely that more cases of sarcoidosis will be encountered by clinicians. We describe three unusual cases of interferon-induced sarcoidosis and review the most recent relevant literature on this subject.
Interferons, on account of their antiviral antigrowth and immunomodulatory effects, are used to treat various internal and dermatological diseases. Exogenously administered interferons stimulate the Th-1 response, which plays a major role in granuloma formation. In most of the patients with interferon-induced sarcoidosis, the disease subsides when interferon is discontinued. Occasionally, treatment with corticosteroids may become necessary.
Interferon therapy can induce or exacerbate sarcoidosis, the disease disappears when interferon is discontinued, sometimes treatment with corticosteroids is required.
Five patients with Crohn's disease for 4 months to 12 years were treated with metronidazole. Four of them improved after 2-4 weeks' treatment. In three of them corticosteroids and sulphasalazine could be withdrawn. One patient did not improve until 4 months of metronidazole treatment had passed and corticosteroids were reintroduced. In three patients metronidazole was discontinued after 4-6 months of treatment. Two of them had no signs or symptoms of relapse 3 and 6 months later. The third patient is free from symptoms but laboratory data indicate disease activity.
Although clinical experience with liposomal doxorubicin is still limited in solid tumours, single agent Caelyx (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) treatment has shown promising results in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, metastatic breast and ovarian cancer and anecdotally in other solid tumours. This is the first report of its use in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The objective of this multicenter phase II study was to evaluate the safety, tolerance and anti-tumour activity of Caelyx as monotherapy in patients with recurrent SCLC.
A total of 14 patients with recurrent SCLC who had not received prior treatment with doxorubicin, were accrued into this phase II study. All patients had progressed or relapsed after first-line chemotherapy. All but one had achieved objective responses to first-line treatment with median duration of five months (range 2-18 months) but half of them had experienced 'refractory' relapses (within 3-4 months). Study treatment consisted of Caelyx 50 mg/m2 (1-hour i.v infusion every 4 weeks for 6 cycles).
No responses were seen but in three patients disease was stabilised for a median of three months. The median number of cycles was 2 per patient, with 11 of 14 patients not completing 6 cycles of Caelyx treatment. From those, five patients were removed from the study after only one cycle due to rapid disease progression, and one was withdrawn after three cycles due to prolonged toxicity. Overall, treatment was well tolerated with no episodes of grade 4 toxicity and only two episodes of grade 3 toxicities: one of thrombocytopenia and one of prolonged palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE).
These results demonstrate limited activity of Caelyx in this patient population, which may be related to the poor prognostic features of such patients. Our findings are in agreement with previous observations that doxorubicin-containing combinations are rarely active in platinum/etoposide failures. However, as in other studies the favourable toxicity profile of Caelyx is confirmed.
Plasticity of glutamatergic synapses is a fundamental mechanism through which experience changes neural function to impact future behavior. In animal models of addiction, glutamatergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) exerts powerful control over drug-seeking behavior. However, little is known about whether, how or when experience with drugs may trigger synaptic plasticity in this key nucleus. Using whole-cell synaptic physiology in NAc brain slices, we demonstrate that a progression of bidirectional changes in glutamatergic synaptic strength occurs after repeated in vivo exposure to cocaine. During a protracted drug-free period, NAc neurons from cocaine-experienced mice develop a robust potentiation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. However, a single re-exposure to cocaine during extended withdrawal becomes a potent stimulus for synaptic depression, abruptly reversing the initial potentiation. These enduring modifications in AMPAR-mediated responses and plasticity may provide a neural substrate for disrupted processing of drug-related stimuli in drug-experienced individuals.
The authors delineate the clinical characteristics of mood state changes that occur in stable opioid-dependent patients undergoing therapeutic detoxification from methadone maintenance treatment.
Twenty-four patients participated in a blinded protocol for gradual methadone dose reduction that included weekly assessments of affective state using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) as well as weekly assessments of signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Data obtained before methadone dose reduction and during the 2-week period of maximal dysphoric symptoms were compared. Changes in affective and opioid withdrawal measures were compared in patients who differed in their success in completing the detoxification regimen.
Sustained increases in POMS scores of greater than 20 points were observed in 12 of the 24 patients during the course of detoxification. The emergence of symptoms of dysphoria was accompanied by insomnia, loss of appetite, and somatic complaints consistent with symptoms of opioid withdrawal but only minimal levels of objective signs of withdrawal. Greater changes from baseline in mood state and opioid withdrawal measures occurred in patients who were unable to complete the detoxification regimen.
The development of an organic mood syndrome is a common occurrence in patients undergoing slow detoxification from methadone maintenance treatment and is associated with a poor outcome.
The objective of this study was to prove the efficacy of intravenous disopyramide in the treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia resistant to vagal maneuvers. Nine patients with this condition were admitted to the emergency service of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiología Ignacio Chávez. They were given an intravenous bolus of 2 mg/kg of the drug a maintenance dose of 0.4 mg/kg during 3 hours. The undesirable effects of the drug were arterial hypotension, dizziness, dry mouth, transient A-V dissociation and scape-capture rhythm. In conclussion, disopyramide is an excellent drug in the treatment of paroxysmal supra-ventricular tachycardia resistant to vagal maneuvers, but an strict monitorization of the arterial pressure and electrocardiogram should be kept during its administration.
Aflatoxins are fungal products which occur in food and feed. They are potent hepatocarcinogens, and are known to cause immunosuppression. We investigated the effect of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)), aflatoxin B(2) (AFB(2)) and aflatoxin G(1) (AFG(1)) exposure, alone and in combination, on the secretion of key pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from the murine macrophage cell line, J774A.1. Exposure of macrophages to low doses of aflatoxin (0.01 or 0.1ng/mL) resulted in a statistically significant change in the secretion of a number of cytokines following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls. Specifically, treatment with AFB(1) or AFB(2) alone significantly decreased (P<0.01) the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 10 (IL-10), while the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly increased (P<0.01). In addition, aflatoxin exposure affected expression levels of key cell surface markers involved in the inflammatory response. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Cluster of Differentiation 14 (CD14) expression levels decreased significantly (P<0.01), but Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression was unaffected. This data provides further insight into the mechanisms by which aflatoxins modulate the host immune response to exert their immunosuppressive activity.
HER2 and TOP2A genes, located on 17q, can be coamplified in cancer. Overexpression of both genes has been reported in high-grade, androgen-resistant prostate cancer. Both genes have not been compared in a single prostate cancer study and the frequency of TOP2A amplifications in prostate cancer is unknown. Using tissue microarrays, we did immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization for HER2 and TOP2A in 100 prostate cancers (41 localized and 59 advanced) and 42 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Amplification was defined as a target/centromere signal ratio of > or =1.5. HER2 immunohistochemistry was scored from 0 to 3+. Percentage nuclei staining for topoisomerase IIalpha (topoIIalpha) was recorded; overexpression was defined as > or =5% cells staining. Eighteen (31%) advanced prostate cancers showed topoIIalpha overexpression; 12 (26%) showed TOP2A low-level amplification; 9 (16%) expressed HER2; and 6 (13%) showed HER2 low-level amplification. No high-level amplification of either gene (target/centromere signal ratio of > or =3.0) was detected. TOP2A coexpression and coamplification were seen in 75% and 66% of HER2-positive cases, respectively. Localized prostate cancer or BPH showed no gene amplification or topoIIalpha overexpression. Gene amplification or overexpression correlated with high stage and Gleason score. The presence of TOP2A amplification in advanced cancer was associated with androgen resistance and decreased survival by multivariate analysis. This is the first study to document low-level TOP2A amplification in prostate cancer and an association with reduced survival. TOP2A amplification may occur with or without HER2 duplication and is often associated with topoIIalpha expression. Therapies directed against topoIIalpha (and HER2) in such patients may improve survival.
The pharmacological treatment of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) now includes the experimental use of controlled-release biocompatible compounds that deliver a desired drug locally into the subarachnoid space. A controlled-release system consists of an active material that is incorporated into a carrier, usually in the form of a pellet or a gel. With such systems, the desired agent is delivered slowly and continuously, for long periods of time, directly to the desired site. This technology makes it possible to achieve high local concentrations of therapeutic agents while minimizing systemic toxicity and circumventing the need to cross the blood-brain barrier. This review describes controlled-release systems developed to date for local drug delivery in the treatment of CVS in both animal models and humans.
A MEDLINE PubMed database search was performed for articles published from 1975 to 2007 with the following search topics: "controlled-release system/polymer," "controlled-release implants," "cerebral vasospasm," "subarachnoid hemorrhage," "subarachnoid space," and "intracranial drug delivery."
Over the past several decades, several controlled-release systems (lactic/ glycolic acid pellets, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, liposomes, silicone elastomers) have been developed to deliver various pharmacological agents (papaverine, nicardipine, ibuprofen, nitric oxide donor, calcitonin gene-related peptide, fasudil, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) intracranially to treat subarachnoid hemorrhage in animal models (rats, rabbits, dogs, and primates). Animal studies have shown promising results, and the few human studies that have been published using controlled-release systems with papaverine or nicardipine report similarly encouraging outcomes.
Controlled-release systems have evolved over the past few years and have been shown experimentally to be an effective strategy for the local delivery of drugs to treat CVS.
Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure with normal cerebrospinal fluid composition. It is usually associated with many medical conditions and drugs. It has been reported that all-trans-retinoic acid can induce pseudotumor cerebri. The authors report a 35-year-old patient diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia who developed pseudotumor cerebri after receiving all-trans-retinoic acid. The patient was treated with 60 mg/day of all-trans-retinoic acid. Two weeks later, she had severe headache and blurred vision. The neurological examination revealed papilledema and decreased visual acuity. Other physical examinations were unremarkable. Brain CT was normal. Additionally, lumbar puncture was performed and the CSF finding was normal except for high CSF pressure. According to modified Dandy criteria, the diagnosis was pseudotumor cerebri. The patient's symptoms disappeared after all-trans-retinoic acid was discontinued. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in Thailand.
A 63-year-old white male with a 25-year history of hypertension experienced the onset of intermittent diplopia and gait disturbance 24 hours after a change in antihypertensive medication from atenolol 50 mg/d to enalapril 5 mg bid. Three weeks later, the patient was admitted with a worsening of symptoms. Cerebral arteriography revealed significant bilateral vertebral artery stenosis. Symptoms continued to progress in the hospital, and at the time of posterior circulation revascularization the patient had a persistent bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia and right ptosis. The need for a neurovascular workup and adjustment of therapy in patients with antihypertensive-associated cerebral ischemia is discussed.
The mechanism of intrathecal antinociceptive action of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil was assessed in diabetic rats using the formalin test. Intrathecal administration of sildenafil (12.5-50 microg) produced a dose-related antinociception during both phases of the formalin test in non-diabetic and diabetic rats. Intrathecal pretreatment with N-L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, 1-50 microg), 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo(4,2-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1-10 microg), KT5823 (protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor, 5-500 ng), charybdotoxin (large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker, 0.01-1 ng), apamin (small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker, 0.1-3 ng) and glibenclamide (ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, 12.5-50 microg), but not N-D-nitro-arginine methyl ester (D-NAME, 50 microg) or saline, significantly diminished sildenafil (50 microg)-induced antinociception in non-diabetic rats. Intrathecal administration of ODQ, KT5823, apamin and glibenclamide, but not L-NAME nor charybdotoxin, reversed intrathecal antinociception induced by sildenafil in diabetic rats. Results suggest that sildenafil produces its intrathecal antinociceptive effect via activation of NO-cyclic GMP-PKG-K+ channels pathway in non-diabetic rats. Data suggest that diabetes leads to a dysfunction in NO and large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Sildenafil could have a role in the pharmacotherapy of diabetes-associated pain.
The current therapeutic approaches for pulmonary fibrosis, which is characterized by fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, are unsatisfactory. Feitai, consisting of several herbs, is a folk formula for pulmonary tuberculosis therapy in China. To investigate the effects of Feitai on pulmonary fibrosis, Feitai was administered orally to bleomycin (BLM)-treated rats, and the lung toxicity effects were evaluated according to inflammatory cell count, protein concentration, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), malondialdehyde level and hydroxyproline content in lung tissue 28 days post-BLM. Serial sections of the lung were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson trichrome, respectively. The degree of fibrosis was assessed quantitatively using LEICA QWin image analyzer. Results showed that Feitai inhibited BLM-induced lung fibrotic lesions in a dose-dependent manner as reflected by decreased the lung hydroxyproline content and lung fibrosis fraction 28 days after BLM instillation. Treatment with Feitai also significantly ameliorated the BLM-induced lung toxicity effects detected in BALF and lung tissue. The effects in vitro on WI-38 human lung fibroblast cell line showed that Feitai significantly reduced the cell proliferation and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta stimulated type I collagen synthesis. These results strongly demonstrate that Feitai may be useful in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.
We have previously reported on a high prevalence of high renin essential hypertension in psoriasis. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was also reported to be increased in some psoriatics, we found it rational to treat 10 patients with hypertension and diffuse psoriasis with captopril at a dose of 25 mg t.i.d. Five patients had high PRA levels and in 1 of them serum ACE was also increased. Serum creatinine, BUN and urinalysis were normal in all of them. SPB fell from 163 +/- 3 to 138 +/- 3 and DBP from 107 +/- 3 to 86 +/- 2 mm Hg after 1 month of captopril treatment. A surprising clinical improvement of the cutaneous lesions occurred in 3 patients previously resistant to every local or systemic treatment. Unfortunately, however, 3 patients developed heavy proteinuria (greater than 2 g/day) which disappeared after captopril discontinuation. The unexpected incidence of reversible proteinuria induced by low doses of captopril in our patients recommends a careful monitoring of the renal function every time this drug is employed in the treatment of hypertension in a psoriatic.
Long-term administration of the cholinergic drug pilocarpine attenuates the catalepsy induced by an acute injection of pilocarpine or the deopamine antagonist chlorpromazine. Similar results (i.e., tolerance to pilocarpine and cross-tolerance to chlorpromazine) were noted in mice chronically treated with the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine but not in mice chronically treated with neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor which does not penetrate the central nervous system. Mice maintained on the anticholinergic scopolamine showed the opposite effect; there was an increase in the sensitivity to the catalepsy induced by pilocarpine or chlorpromazine. The results suggest that long-term changes in cholinergic receptors may indirectly alter the behavioral effects of drugs which act via dopamine.
Fifty-four children aged 1-10 years, scheduled for day-case anaesthesia were prescribed either oral midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 or a placebo preparation 30-60 min pre-operatively on a double-blind basis. On arrival at the induction room, anxiolysis was satisfactory in 23 out of 24 (96%) children who received midazolam compared with 12 out of 27 (44%) of those who received placebo (p < 0.001); at induction of anaesthesia these proportions were 21 out of 24 (88%) and nine out of 27 (33%) respectively (p < 0.001). The time to early recovery from anaesthesia was somewhat longer in children premedicated with midazolam compared with controls (28.2 vs 21.9 min) (p < 0.05). Similarly, the time to hospital discharge was longer in the midazolam group (244 vs 185 min) (p < 0.01). Analysis of behavioural questionnaires completed by parents 2 weeks after hospitalisation indicated that there were fewer postoperative behavioural disturbances in children premedicated with midazolam compared with controls (p < 0.05).
This article reports an unusual case of acute interstitial nephritis associated with nephrotic syndrome which appeared after oral intake of naproxen and amoxicillin and led to end-stage renal failure. In the light of recent literature on this clinical entity, the authors formulate hypotheses accounting for this outcome.
