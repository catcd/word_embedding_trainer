Levodopa dose and severity of Parkinson's disease (PD) are recognized risk factors for levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in humans. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ability of these variables to predict severity of LID in a rat model of PD. Varied concentrations of 6-hydroxy-dopamine were injected into the midbrain to produce wide ranges of dopamine depletion in striatum. Three weeks later, rats were given daily injections of levodopa (2-10 mg/kg i.p.) plus benserazide (12.5 mg/kg i.p.) for 15 days. Abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were measured for limb, axial, orolingual, and rotatory movements. Dose-response analysis for total AIM scores yielded a levodopa ED50 value of 3.2 mg/kg on treatment day 15. There were strong interrelated correlations between individual AIM categories (rho > 0.7) and for each AIM category in regard to total AIM score (rho > 0.7). In rats that received levodopa doses that were greater than the ED50, rates of amphetamine-induced rotation were significantly correlated with total AIM scores (rho = 0.413). However, of those rotating >5 times/min, 34% had relatively low AIM scores (<8). Likewise, there was a significant correlation between percentages of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) loss and total AIM scores (rho = 0.388). However, in those rats that had >85% TH loss, 30% had AIM scores <8. Our results show that given an adequate dose and magnitude of striatal dopamine depletion, levodopa produces dyskinesia with a continuous spectrum of severity. Although levodopa dose and level of dopamine depletion are significant risk factors for LID, we conclude that other factors must contribute to LID susceptibility.
Fisetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid that has been reported to inhibit the proliferation and to induce apoptotic cell death in several tumor cells. However, the apoptosis-inducing effect of fisetin on tumor cell lines was investigated besides HeLa cells. In this study, we found that fisetin induced apoptosis of HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evidenced by nuclear staining of 4'-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), flow cytometry assay, and Annexin-V/PI double-labeling. In addition, fisetin triggered the activations of caspases-3 and -8 and the cleavages of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, resulting in apoptosis induction. Moreover, treatment of HeLa cells with fisetin induced a sustained activation of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) or transfection with the mutant ERK1/2 expression vector significantly abolished the fisetin-induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase-8/-3 pathway. The in vivo xenograft mice experiments revealed that fisetin significantly reduced tumor growth in mice with HeLa tumor xenografts. In conclusion, our results indicated that fisetin exhibited anti-cancer effect and induced apoptosis in HeLa cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.
The safety of hypotension induced by sevoflurane and splanchnic organ blood flow remains to be clarified. The aim was to investigate the effects of sevoflurane-induced hypotension on systemic haemodynamics and splanchnic organ blood flows in dogs.
Mean arterial pressure was maintained at 60 mmHg by increasing sevoflurane concentrations. The renal, hepatic and pancreatic blood flows were measured by using the hydrogen clearance method.
Hypotension induced by sevoflurane resulted in a 50% decrease of mean arterial pressure due to a 30% reduction in systemic vascular resistance associated with a 30% decrease in cardiac index. The mechanisms causing the lower cardiac index were produced by the decreases in heart rate and left ventricular dP/dt(max). Renal, hepatic and pancreatic blood flow were reduced, but the whole-body oxygen consumption did not change during the hypotensive period.
The haemodynamic changes induced by sevoflurane were caused by the suppression of arterial baroreflexes and myocardial depression, but splanchnic organ blood flows, though reduced, could provide adequate peripheral perfusion to meet the decrease in oxygen supply.
We identified association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) with PTPRD at 9p23-24 in 2,458 affected individuals and 4,749 controls from Germany, Austria, Czechia and Canada. Two independent SNPs in the 5' UTR of splice variants expressed predominantly in the central nervous system showed highly significant P values (rs4626664, P(nominal/lambda corrected) = 5.91 x 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) = 1.44; rs1975197, P(nominal/lambda corrected) = 5.81 x 10(-9), OR = 1.31). This work identifies PTPRD as the fourth genome-wide significant locus for RLS.
We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy at our institution during the period from January 1970 through December 1986 to determine the frequency of postoperative occlusions and the role of heparin-induced thrombosis in patients with such occlusions. After 2,527 carotid endarterectomies, a total of 19 occlusions occurred in 18 patients. Of these 18 patients, 6 had an associated heparin-induced coagulation disorder, 3 of whom are described in detail. Although heparin is a useful anticoagulant, it may precipitate occlusion of vessels after an endarterectomy procedure, either at the endarterectomy site or elsewhere. Physicians should be aware of the potentially increased risk for embolic or thrombotic cerebrovascular events in patients who receive heparin therapy.
Membrane-bound serine proteases play important roles in different biological processes. Their regulation by endogenous inhibitors is poorly understood. A Y163C mutation in the SPINT2 gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor Hepatocyte Growth Factor Inhibitor HAI-2 is associated with a congenital sodium diarrhea. The functional consequences of this mutation on HAI-2 activity and its physiological targets are unknown. We established a cellular assay in Xenopus laevis oocytes to study functional interactions between HAI-2 and candidate membrane-bound serine proteases expressed in the gastro-intestinal tract. We found that the wild-type form of HAI-2 is a potent inhibitor of nine gastro-intestinal serine proteases. The Y163C mutation in the second Kunitz domain of HAI-2 resulted in a complete loss of inhibitory activity on two intestinal proteases, prostasin and tmprss13. The effect of the mutation of the homologous Y68C in the first Kunitz domain of HAI-2 is consistent with a differential contribution of the two Kunitz domains of HAI-2 in the inhibition of serine proteases. By contrast to the Tyr to Cys, the Tyr to Ser substitution did not change the inhibitory potency of HAI-2, indicating that the thiol-group of the cysteine rather than the Tyr deletion is responsible for the HAI-2 loss of function. Our functional assay allowed us to identify membrane-bound serine proteases as cellular target for inhibition by HAI-2 wild type and mutants, and to better define the role of the Tyr in the second Kunitz domain in the inhibitory activity of HAI-2.
Human cerebral function was monitored electrophysiologically during sleep over a period of months before, during, and after the intake of fenfluramine, 40-120 mg/day. Effects included dose-related reduction of paradoxical sleep, increase of intra-sleep restlessness, and changes in E.E.G. slow-wave sleep. It is hypothesized that weight loss may be associated with increase of the last. Grinding of teeth (bruxism) also was noted.Long-term studies make it possible to demonstrate changing central effects with time, including tolerance phenomena. Withdrawal abnormalities are related to the time taken for the drug to be eliminated-in the present case reaching a maximum four days after withdrawal.
The aim of this study was to determine whether cortisol-induced hypertension can be reversed by co-administration of oral L-arginine.
Three studies were undertaken in healthy male human subjects. The first study addressed the effect of oral L-arginine loading on plasma arginine concentration. Study 2 addressed the effect of co-administration of cortisol with L-arginine on plasma L-arginine concentrations. Study 3 was a randomized placebo crossover control comparing the effects of cortisol 80 mg/day co-administered with a placebo to cortisol 80 mg/day co-administered with L-arginine 21 g/day.
Blood pressure was measured by a random Hawksley sphygmomanometer. Plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations were measured by a modified Greiss reaction. Plasma arginine and citrulline concentrations were measured by an automated amino acid analyser.
Plasma arginine concentrations were doubled by oral doses of 15 g/day and 21 g/day of L-arginine (study 1). Co-administration of cortisol did not alter plasma arginine concentrations in subjects taking 21 g of L-arginine per day (study 2). Co-administration of L-arginine 21 g/day with cortisol 80 mg/day did not prevent cortisol-induced increases in blood pressure or cortisol-induced falls in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations.
Cortisol-induced hypertension is accompanied by a fall in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations. Oral L-arginine administration does not prevent cortisol-induced falls in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations or increases in blood pressure. We propose that cortisol-induced reductions in nitrate/nitrite production occur at a point distal to L-arginine availability in the nitric oxide synthase pathway.
Pain is the hallmark of patients with chronic prostatitis (CP) and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). Despite numerous hypotheses, the etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. To better understand CP/CPPS, we used a murine experimental autoimmune prostatitis model to examine the development, localization, and modulation of pelvic pain. Pelvic pain was detected 5 days after antigen instillation and was sustained beyond 30 days, indicating the development of chronic pain. The pain was attenuated by lidocaine treatment into the prostate, but not into the bladder or the colon, suggesting that pain originated from the prostate. Experimental autoimmune prostatitis histopathology was confined to the prostate with focal periglandular inflammatory infiltrates in the ventral, dorsolateral, and anterior lobes of the mouse prostate. Inflammation and pelvic pain were positively correlated and increased with time. Morphologically, the dorsolateral prostate alone showed significantly increased neuronal fiber distribution, as evidenced by increased protein gene product 9.5 expression. Pelvic pain was attenuated by treatment with the neuromodulator gabapentin, suggesting spinal and/or supraspinal contribution to chronic pain. These results provide the basis for identifying mechanisms that regulate pelvic pain and the testing of therapeutic agents that block pain development in CP/CPPS.
The adverse effects of antiviral drugs are dose dependent and often reversible. The major side effects include influenza-like symptoms, hematologic abnormalities and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The influenza-like syndrome can be prevented by paracetamol taken at the time of the injection. Psychiatric adverse effects range from irritability to a severe depressive syndrome. Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be useful in the management. Adverse hematologic effects can occur very early during treatment. The platelet count often stabilizes rapidly, but neutropenia can deteriorate throughout treatment. In selected patients treatment with hematopoietic growth factor (filgrastim) may be useful. Ribavirin therapy may result in a dose-dependent reversible intravascular hemolytic anemia in 10% of patients. Adjunctive therapy with erythropoietin for ribavirin-induced anemia is currently under evaluation. Interferons and ribavirin are contraindicated in pregnancy. Contraception must be continued for 4 months (women) and 7 months (men) after ribavirin cessation. Lactic acidosis may be a rare complication of combination therapy in patients undergoing therapy for HIV and HCV. Any sign of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome calls for blood lactate measurement and, possibly, a modification of antiretroviral treatment. Lamivudine is well tolerated but the emergence of lamivudine-resistant (YMDD) HBV mutants is associated with the loss of clinical response. Adefovir dipivoxil effectively suppresses lamivudine-resistant HBV in chronic hepatitis B.
The acute hepatotoxicity of the three isomers of dichlorobenzene (DCB) was evaluated in male Fischer-344 (F344) rats at various times following ip administration. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, measured in F344 rats 24 hr postexposure, was dramatically elevated following doses of 1.8-5.4 mmol/kg of o-DCB. Conversely, equimolar doses of p-DCB produced no such toxicity, while m-DCB produced intermediate hepatic injury at or above doses of 2.7 mmol/kg. Histopathological changes in livers from treated animals qualitatively reflected elevations in 24-hr plasma ALT activity (time to maximal elevation). Phenobarbital pretreatment potentiated the acute hepatotoxicity of o- and m-DCB, but did not affect the toxicity of p-DCB. Likewise, SKF-525A pretreatment inhibited the hepatotoxicity of o-DCB. Equimolar doses of o- and m-DCB produced approximately equivalent depletion of intrahepatic glutathione, while p-DCB had no effect on hepatic GSH. Furthermore, prior depletion of hepatic glutathione by pretreatment with phorone markedly potentiated the hepatotoxicity of o- and m-DCB, while increasing the toxicity of p-DCB to a far lesser degree. The differential hepatotoxicity of the o- and m-DCB does not appear to be explained adequately by differences in their hepatic distribution or in vivo covalent binding to hepatic proteins. Interestingly, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats are relatively refractive to the acute hepatotoxicity of o-DCB following ip administration of 1.8 and 5.4 mmol/kg. The combination of these dramatic differences (structure-activity and animal strains) should be useful in elucidating key events involved in the hepatotoxicity caused by these compounds.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Mitochondria act to connect genes and environment by regulating gene-encoded metabolic networks according to changes in the chemistry of the cell and its environment. Mitochondrial ATP and other metabolites are mitokines-signaling molecules made in mitochondria-that undergo regulated release from cells to communicate cellular health and danger to neighboring cells via purinergic signaling. The role of purinergic signaling has not yet been explored in autism spectrum disorders.
We used the maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model of gestational poly(IC) exposure and treatment with the non-selective purinergic antagonist suramin to test the role of purinergic signaling in C57BL/6J mice.
We found that antipurinergic therapy (APT) corrected 16 multisystem abnormalities that defined the ASD-like phenotype in this model. These included correction of the core social deficits and sensorimotor coordination abnormalities, prevention of cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, correction of the ultrastructural synaptic dysmorphology, and correction of the hypothermia, metabolic, mitochondrial, P2Y2 and P2X7 purinergic receptor expression, and ERK1/2 and CAMKII signal transduction abnormalities.
Hyperpurinergia is a fundamental and treatable feature of the multisystem abnormalities in the poly(IC) mouse model of autism spectrum disorders. Antipurinergic therapy provides a new tool for refining current concepts of pathogenesis in autism and related spectrum disorders, and represents a fresh path forward for new drug development.
The aim of this study was to study valproate efficacy and safety for aggression in children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD).
In this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 subjects (20 boys, 10 girls) 6-20 years of age with PDD and significant aggression were randomized and received treatment with valproate (VPA) or placebo (PBO) for 8 weeks as outpatients. Mean VPA trough blood levels were 75.5 mcg/mL at week 4 and 77.8 mcg/mL at week 8.
No treatment difference was observed statistically between VPA and PBO groups. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist--Community Scale (ABC-C) Irritability subscale was the primary outcome measure (p = 0.65), and CGI--Improvement (p = 0.16) and OAS (p = 0.96) were secondary outcome measures. Increased appetite and skin rash were significant side effects. Only 1 subject was dropped from the study owing to side effects, notably a spreading skin rash, which then resolved spontaneously. Two subjects receiving VPA developed increased serum ammonia levels, one with an associated parent report of slurred speech and mild cognitive slowing. Poststudy, of 16 VPA and PBO subjects receiving VPA, 10 subjects demonstrated sustained response, 4 of whom later attempted taper, with significant relapse of aggression.
The present negative findings cannot be viewed as conclusive, partly owing to the large placebo response, subject heterogeneity, and size of the groups. Larger studies are needed to expand upon these findings.
We report a case of myocardial infarction associated with the use of sumatriptan and review the literature regarding similar cases. A 54-year-old woman with a history of migraine without aura, mild arterial hypertension, depression, and no history of coronary artery disease was admitted to our hospital for acute myocardial infarction, 30 minutes after using 6 mg of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Coronary angiography performed several days later revealed a normal coronary arterial system. Although at discharge the patient was advised to permanently avoid triptans, she continued the use of oral sumatriptan at low dosage (25-50 mg) without any problems.
A boy developed recurrent steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome following renal transplantation for congenital nephrotic syndrome. The first episode was associated with mild tubulointerstitial rejection on kidney biopsy. Subsequent episodes showed normal histology by light microscopy and epithelial foot process fusion on electron microscopy, consistent with minimal change nephrotic syndrome. Serum analysis for soluble immune response suppressor was negative pre-nephrectomy, positive during each bout of nephrotic syndrome, and negative during each remission. This case represents de novo occurrence of steroid-sensitive minimal change nephrotic syndrome following renal transplantation for congenital nephrotic syndrome. We stress the need for histological examination of the renal allograft to diagnose rejection, recurrent disease, or de novo disease.
Drugs and metastatic malignant tumors induce severe alterations in cutaneous axons. The most prominent ultrastructural feature of axonal dystrophy of this type was the presence of multiple lamellated osmiophilic bodies (LOB), similar to those occurring in hereditary disorders with increase of brain gangliosides and lipid storage. Chloroquine, ergotamine, ethaverine and chronic abuse of non-narcotic analgesic drugs seem to be responsible for the drug-induced cutaneous neuro-phospholipidosis, whereas the same condition was found in two patients with metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma and malignant melanoma.
Collybistin (CB) is a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) selectively activating Cdc42. CB mutations cause X-linked mental retardation due to defective clustering of gephyrin, a postsynaptic protein associated with both glycine and GABA(A) receptors. Using a combination of biochemistry and cell biology we provide novel insights into the roles of the CB2 splice variants, CB2(SH3+) and CB2(SH3-), and their substrate, Cdc42, in regulating gephyrin clustering at GABAergic synapses. Transfection of Myc-tagged CB2(SH3+) and CB2(SH3-) into cultured neurons revealed strong, but distinct, effects promoting postsynaptic gephyrin clustering, denoting mechanistic differences in their function. In addition, overexpression of constitutively active or dominant-negative Cdc42 mutants identified a new function of Cdc42 in regulating the shape and size of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters. Using biochemical assays and native brain tissue, we identify a direct interaction between gephyrin and Cdc42, independent of its activation state. Finally, our data show that CB2(SH3-), but not CB2(SH3+), can form a ternary complex with gephyrin and Cdc42, providing a biochemical substrate for the distinct contribution of these CB isoforms in gephyrin clustering at GABAergic postsynaptic sites. Taken together, our results identify CB and Cdc42 as major regulators of GABAergic postsynaptic densities.
Simvastatin reduces cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but, as with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, can cause significant muscle toxicity and has been associated with elevations of liver transaminases.
Muscle and liver adverse effects of simvastatin 40 mg daily were evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial involving 20,536 UK patients with vascular disease or diabetes (in which a substantial reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity has previously been demonstrated).
The excess incidence of myopathy in the simvastatin group was < 0.1% over the 5 years of the trial, and there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in the incidence of serious hepatobiliary disease.
Among the many different types of high-risk patient studied (including women, older individuals and those with low cholesterol levels), there was a very low incidence (< 0.1%) of myopathy during 5 years treatment with simvastatin 40 mg daily. The risk of hepatitis, if any, was undetectable even in this very large long-term trial. Routine monitoring of liver function tests during treatment with simvastatin 40 mg is not useful.
Angiogenesis and tumor-associated immunosuppression are two of the hallmarks of carcinogenesis. In previous studies we demonstrated in vitro that HNSCC tumor cells attract monocytes via monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and activate them via transforming growth factor-beta 1(TGF-beta1) to secrete interleukin (IL)-1alpha, which in turn stimulates tumor cells to secrete increased levels of the angiogenic and immunosuppressive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These findings suggest that interaction between the immune system and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis is important for progression of HNSCC. Recent studies in vitro show that retinoic acid (RA) downregulates the release of MCP-1 and TGF-beta1 by tumor cells. Therefore, we investigated the ability of RA to modulate the ability of tumor cells to recruit and activate monocytes for participation in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and immunosuppression in vivo.
Mice (ten/group) were injected daily with RA (160 microg/kg) for 3 weeks. After that time mice were sacrificed, and paraffin sections of tumors were obtained and stained for VEGF-A, CD68, and PECAM (CD31) by immunohistochemistry. The lungs, liver, and myocardium were analyzed for macro- and micrometastases. The plasma protein levels of VEGF-A and MCP-1 were determined by ELISA.
In RA-treated mice tumors regressed completely and RA prevented metastases (p=0.00) and macrophage infiltration (p=0.007). Treated mice downregulated VEGF-A (0 pg/ml) and MCP-1 (12 pg/ml) in peripheral blood (p=0.001).
Our findings suggest a new therapeutic possibility: the development of treatment protocols that can block each of the ways in which tumors induce new blood vessel growth and immunosuppression of the host.
In six conscious, trained dogs, maintained on a normal sodium intake of 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day, sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of norepinephrine and epinephrine during 15-minute i.v. infusions of human alpha-atrial natriuretic factor. Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitroglycerin. The release rate of epinephrine (control, 6.7 +/- 0.6 ng/kg/min) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 +/- 5% of control (p less than 0.001) during 0.1 microgram/kg/min and to 63 +/- 5% (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05) or 95 +/- 13% (not significant) during 0.3 or 1.0 microgram/kg/min. Steady state arterial plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were 39 +/- 10 pg/ml (n = 6) during infusions of saline and 284 +/- 24 pg/ml (n = 6) and 1520 +/- 300 pg/ml (n = 9) during 0.03 and 0.1 microgram/kg/min infusions of the factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) are heteromultimeric complexes that mediate calcium influx into cells in response to changes in membrane potential. The alpha1A subunit, encoded by the CACNA1A gene, is the pore-forming subunit specific to the neuronal P/Q-type VDCCs. These are implicated in fast excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Their highest levels of expression are found in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and in the hippocampus. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA 6) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar degeneration that shares neuropathological findings with late-onset cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA). It is caused by an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat in exon 47 of CACNA1A, on chromosome 19p13. This translates into a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract of prolonged length in the carboxyl terminal of the alpha1A subunit. Heterologous expression of mutated alpha1A subunits results in increased channel inactivation in electrophysiological tests. No treatment is known to improve SCA 6 at present, as none of the available drugs is able to reverse alpha1A dysregulation, nor disturbed protein aggregation, transport and localization in this disease. The drugs gabapentin and pregabalin interact with the alpha2delta subunit of the P/Q-type VDCCs. Gabapentin and pregabalin slow the rate of inactivation in recombinant P/Q-type VDCCs, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These drugs improve ataxia in cases of CCA, olivopontocerebellar atrophy and ataxia-telangiectasia. On the basis of the neuropathological identity of SCA 6 with CCA, and given the capacity of gabapentin and pregabalin to decrease P/Q-type VDCCs inactivation, in this paper the authors put forward the hypothesis that the administration of gabapentin and pregabalin might prove beneficial in SCA 6 as the ataxia caused by this disease would be expected to improve. The authors hope that researchers working with this illness will be inspired and encouraged to undertake the appropriate clinical and experimental work.
Previous evidence has implicated E prostanoid receptor 4 (EP4) in mechanical hyperalgesia induced by subplantar inflammation. However, its role in chronic arthritis remains to be further defined because previous attempts have generated two conflicting lines of evidence, with one showing a marked reduction of arthritis induced by a collagen antibody in mice lacking EP4, but not EP1-EP3, and the other showing no impact of EP4 antagonism on arthritis induced by collagen. Here, we assessed the effect of a novel and selective EP4 antagonist MF498 [N-{[4-(5,9-diethoxy-6-oxo-6,8-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinolin-7-yl)-3-methylbenzyl]sulfonyl}-2-(2-methoxyphenyl)acetamide] on inflammation in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), a rat model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and joint pain in a guinea pig model of iodoacetate-induced osteoarthritis (OA). In the AIA model, MF498, but not the antagonist for EP1, MF266-1 [1-(5-{3-[2-(benzyloxy)-5-chlorophenyl]-2-thienyl}pyridin-3-yl)-2,2,2-trifluoroethane-1,1-diol] or EP3 MF266-3 [(2E)-N-[(5-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl]-3-[5-chloro-2-(2-naphthylmethyl)phenyl]acrylamide], inhibited inflammation, with a similar efficacy as a selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor MF-tricyclic. In addition, MF498 was as effective as an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac, or a selective microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 inhibitor, MF63 [2-(6-chloro-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)isophthalonitrile], in relieving OA-like pain in guinea pigs. When tested in rat models of gastrointestinal toxicity, the EP4 antagonist was well tolerated, causing no mucosal leakage or erosions. Lastly, we evaluated the renal effect of MF498 in a furosemide-induced diuresis model and demonstrated that the compound displayed a similar renal effect as MF-tricyclic [3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-2-(5H)-furanone], reducing furosemide-induced natriuresis by approximately 50%. These results not only suggest that EP4 is the major EP receptor in both RA and OA but also provide a proof of principle to the concept that antagonism of EP4 may be useful for treatment of arthritis.
Twenty neutropenic patients with various haematological disorders were randomised prospectively to receive either intravenous amphotericin B alone or amphotericin B and oral amiloride 5 mg twice a day for treatment of confirmed or suspected fungal infection. Patients receiving amiloride had a significantly higher plasma potassium (p less than 0.01), a significantly lower urinary potassium loss (p less than 0.01), and required significantly less potassium chloride supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (p less than 0.001). Amiloride was well tolerated, had no clinically important side effects, and provided effective control of plasma potassium in patients treated with amphotericin B.
