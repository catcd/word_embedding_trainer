Hepatotoxicity is a major reason for drug nonapprovals and withdrawals. The multiparametric analysis of xenobiotic toxicity at the single cells level using flow cytometry and cellular imaging-based approaches, such as high-content screening (HCS) technology, could play a key role in the detection of toxicity and the classification of compounds based on patterns of cellular injury. This study aimed to develop and validate a practical, reproducible, in vitro multiparametric cell-based protocol to assess those drugs that are potentially hepatotoxic to humans and to suggest their mechanisms of action. The assay was applied to HepG2 human cell line cultured in 96-well plates and exposed to 78 different compounds for 3 and 24 h at a range of concentrations (1-1000μM). After treatments, cells were simultaneously loaded with five fluorescent dyes showing optical compatibility and were then analyzed with the High-Content Screening Station Scan^R (Olympus). By using the new technology of HCS cell parameters associated with nuclear morphology, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial function, intracellular calcium concentration, and oxidative stress, indicative of prelethal cytotoxic effects and representative of different mechanisms of toxicity, were measured at the single cells level, which allows high-throughput screening. This strategy appears to identify early and late events in the hepatotoxic process and also suggests the mechanism(s) implicated in the toxicity of compounds to thereby classify them according to their degree of injury (no injury, low, moderate, and high injury).
Patients with serious systemic infections admitted to eight medical centers in six Asian countries were treated with 300 mg of netilmicin given once daily (group A: 92 patients) or 100 mg of netilmicin given three times daily (group B: 93 patients). Netilmicin was administered by intramuscular injection or slow intravenous infusion until clinical, laboratory, and bacteriologic measures were normalized and for not more than two additional days. A clinical cure was achieved in 88% of the patients from group A and in 68% from group B. The causative micro-organisms were eliminated or infection site healed in 90% of group A and in 88% of group B. The mean treatment duration was 6.9 days in group A and 8.8 days in group B. Two patients in each group developed symptoms of nephrotoxicity; the pretreatment serum creatinine levels in all four patients were in the high borderline range. No other serious side effects were found. It is concluded that netilmicin administered once daily is safe and more effective than netilmicin administered three times daily.
Extrapyramidal side effects induced by some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), i.e. fluoxetine and sertraline, have been previously reported in patients with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the occurrence and management of akathisia induced by fluvoxamine have not been described. In the presented case fluvoxamine-induced akathisia in an OCD patient was partially resistant to the anticholinergic agent biperiden, and was successfully treated with the 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist mianserin. Mianserin (15 mg/day at 21.00 h) was discontinued and then reinstituted (off-on-off-on design). Biperiden was transiently effective in the acute akathisia, while the more persistent akathisia was alleviated by mianserin. Discontinuation of mianserin resulted in recurrence of akathisia, while full amelioration of the symptoms of akathisia was noted when mianserin was reinstituted. No aggravation of OCD symptoms was noted during mianserin administration.
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of gynecological cancer death in the United States. Cisplatin is a DNA damaging agent initially effective against EOC but limited by resistance. P53 plays a critical role in cellular response to DNA damage and has been implicated in EOC response to platinum chemotherapy. In this study, we examined the role of p53 status in EOC response to a novel combination of cisplatin, sodium arsenite, and hyperthermia. Human EOC cells were treated with cisplatin ± 20μM sodium arsenite at 37°C or 39°C for 1 h. Sodium arsenite ± hyperthermia sensitized wild-type p53-expressing (A2780, A2780/CP70, OVCA 420, OVCA 429, and OVCA 433) EOC cells to cisplatin. Hyperthermia sensitized p53-null SKOV-3 and p53-mutant (OVCA 432 and OVCAR-3) cells to cisplatin. P53 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection abrogated sodium arsenite sensitization effect. XPC, a critical DNA damage recognition protein in global genome repair pathway, was induced by cisplatin only in wild-type p53-expressing cells. Cotreatment with sodium arsenite ± hyperthermia attenuated cisplatin-induced XPC in wild-type p53-expressing cells. XPC siRNA transfection sensitized wild-type p53-expressing cells to cisplatin, suggesting that sodium arsenite ± hyperthermia attenuation of XPC is a mechanism by which wild-type p53-expressing cells are sensitized to cisplatin. Hyperthermia ± sodium arsenite enhanced cellular and DNA accumulation of platinum in wild-type p53-expressing cells. Only hyperthermia enhanced platinum accumulation in p53-null cells. In conclusion, sodium arsenite ± hyperthermia sensitizes wild-type p53-expressing EOC cells to cisplatin by suppressing DNA repair protein XPC and increasing cellular and DNA platinum accumulation.
Both epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that ethanol exposure enhances tumor progression. Ethanol exposure promotes cancer cell invasion and is implicated in tumor metastasis. Metastasis consists of multiple processes involving intravasation and extravasation of cancer cells across the blood vessel walls. The integrity of the vascular endothelial barrier that lines the inner surface of blood vessels plays a critical role in cancer cell intravasation/extravasation. We examined the effects of ethanol on the endothelial integrity in vitro. Ethanol at physiologically relevant concentrations did not alter cell viability but disrupted the endothelial monolayer integrity, which was evident by a decrease in the electric resistance and the appearance of intercellular gaps in the endothelial monolayer. The effect of ethanol was reversible once ethanol was removed. The disruption of the endothelial monolayer integrity was associated with an increased invasion of cancer cells through the endothelial monolayer. Ethanol induced the formation of stress fibers; stabilization of actin filaments by jasplakinolide prevented ethanol-induced disruption of endothelial integrity and cancer cell invasion. VE-cadherin is a critical component of the adherens junctions, which regulates vascular endothelial integrity. Ethanol induced the endocytosis of VE-cadherin and the effect was blocked by jasplakinolide. Our results indicate that ethanol may facilitate cancer metastasis by disrupting the vascular endothelial barrier.
Therapies for hormone-independent prostate and breast cancer are limited, with the effectiveness of the taxanes compromised by toxicity, lack of oral bioavailability and drug resistance. This study aims to identify and characterise new microtubule disruptors, which may have improved efficacy relative to the taxanes in hormone-independent cancer. 2-Methoxy-3-O-sulphamoyl-17beta-cyanomethyl-oestra-1,3,5(10)-triene (STX641), 2-methoxy-3-hydroxy-17beta-cyanomethyl-oestra-1,3,5(10)-triene (STX640) and 2-methoxyoestradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulphamate (STX140) were all potent inhibitors of cell proliferation in a panel of prostate and breast cancer cell lines. STX641 and STX640 significantly inhibited tumour growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. STX641 inhibited both in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis. Despite good in vivo activity, STX641 was not as potent in vivo as STX140. Therefore, STX140 was evaluated in the prostate hormone-independent PC-3 xenograft model. STX140 had superior efficacy to docetaxel, 2-MeOE2 and bevacizumab. In contrast to vinorelbine, no significant toxicity was observed. Furthermore, STX140 could be dosed daily over a 60-day period leading to tumour regression and complete responses, which were maintained after the cessation of dosing. This study demonstrates that STX641 and STX140 have considerable potential for the treatment of hormone-independent breast and prostate cancer. In contrast to the taxanes, STX140 can be dosed orally, with no toxicity being observed even after prolonged daily dosing.
A single injection of 17 beta-estradiol valerate produces, 6-7 days later, potentiation of neuroleptic catalepsy. Multiple behavioral measures demonstrate that this effect occurs with an acute dose of haloperidol of 0.25 mg/kg IP. An even lower dose of haloperidol (0.10 mg/kg), which fails to make control rats cataleptic, produces catalepsy in estrogen-treated animals. Thus, estrogen lowers the threshold of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Repeated testing alone induces cataleptic reactions in control rats. Estrogen suppresses such handling-related catalepsy in animals that subsequently show potentiation of catalepsy at a dose of haloperidol (0.10 mg/kg), which has virtually no effect on control rats. Thus, in these behavioral paradigms, estrogen by itself does not produce cataleptic effects, and estrogen-induced potentiation of haloperidol catalepsy is not merely additive to an antecedent, neuroleptic-like effect of this hormone. We interpret our results in terms of (1) the relationship of cataleptic reactions in normal rats to drug-induced cataleptic states; (2) the possible relevance of our behavioral results to basal ganglia disorders; and (3) the relationship of neuroleptic catalepsy to striatal DA receptors and their modulation by estrogen.
The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) investigated the efficacy of ifosfamide with mesna uroprotection in 30 patients with advanced inoperable pancreatic carcinoma that was confirmed histologically. All patients were required to have at least one bidimensional measurable lesion that could be followed by palpation or radiologic examination. Genitourinary toxicity presenting as hematuria occurred in five patients, but was not severe enough to curtail treatment in any of these patients. The major toxicity was neurologic, with 12 patients (41%) reporting at least one episode; four of which were graded as severe and two as fatal. Three partial tumor responses to treatment were reported (10%) and the median survival time was just 11 weeks. In our experience, ifosfamide with mesna uroprotection does not appear to be active in pancreatic carcinoma.
Oxidative stress plays a key role in exacerbating diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a stress response protein, is cytoprotective, but its role in post myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetes is not fully characterized. We aimed to investigate the protection and the mechanisms of HO-1 induction in cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia and in diabetic mice subjected to LAD ligation.
In vitro: cultured cardiomyocytes were treated with cobalt-protoporphyrin (CoPP) and tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) prior to hypoxic stress. In vivo: CoPP treated streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were subjected to LAD ligation for 2/24 h. Cardiac function, histology, biochemical damage markers and signaling pathways were measured.
HO-1 induction lowered release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phospho kinase (CK), decreased propidium iodide staining, improved cell morphology and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiomyocytes. In diabetic mice, Fractional Shortening (FS) was lower than non-diabetic mice (35±1%vs.41±2, respectively p<0.05). CoPP-treated diabetic animals improved cardiac function (43±2% p<0.01), reduced CK, Troponin T levels and infarct size compared to non-treated diabetic mice (P<0.01, P<0.001, P<0.01 respectively). CoPP-enhanced HO-1 protein levels and reduced oxidative stress in diabetic animals, as indicated by the decrease in superoxide levels in cardiac tissues and plasma TNFα levels (p<0.05). The increased levels of HO-1 by CoPP treatment after LAD ligation led to a shift of the Bcl-2/bax ratio towards the antiapoptotic process (p<0.05). CoPP significantly increased the expression levels of pAKT and pGSK3β (p<0.05) in cardiomyocytes and in diabetic mice with MI. SnPP abolished CoPP's cardioprotective effects.
HO-1 induction plays a role in cardioprotection against hypoxic damage in cardiomyocytes and in reducing post ischemic cardiac damage in the diabetic heart as proved by the increased levels of pAKT with a concomitant inhibition of pGSK3β leading to preserved mitochondrial membrane potential.
1. The initial site of damage in analgesic abuse is the renal medulla and the characteristic lesion is renal papillary necrosis. The papillary necrosis appears to be an ischaemic infarct. The cortical lesion of chronic interstial nephritis is a non-specific change and secondary to obstruction to tubules in the necrotic medulla. 2. Medullary perfusion and the concentration mechanism appear to be important factors in the genesis of renal papillary necrosis. 3. Experimental and clinical studies suggest that abuse of compound analgesics containing aspirin, phenacetin and caffeine result in renal papillary necrosis and the clinical syndrome of analgesic nephropathy. In the APC mixture aspirin appears to be the major nephrotoxic agent while phenacetin plays a synergistic but secondary role in the renal nephrotoxicity.
To investigate the potential myocardial ischemic effects of ritodrine, we studied 36 singleton and four twin preterm pregnancies during ritodrine therapy. We serially determined serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK-MB fraction) and lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes and performed electrocardiography before and during ritodrine infusion and again within the first 24 hours of oral drug therapy. We observed that serum CPK-MB and lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes remained within the normal range during therapy periods. The incidence of sinus tachycardia and non-specific T wave changes were 100% and 25%, respectively. In three of four twin pregnancies, ST-T segment depression in leads I, V4, V5, and V6 of the electrocardiogram was noted. Our study suggests that (1) the recommended ritodrine regimen does not produce direct myocardial damage, and (2) ritodrine may cause cardiac ischemia as determined by electrocardiography, which theoretically would progress to myocardial damage if not treated properly.
A case is reported of cardiac failure with repeated pulmonary oedema in a female patient suffering from renal failure and having been given incremental doses of dantrolene sodium. On withdrawal of the drug, all symptoms disappeared. This muscle relaxant was considered not to have any depressive myocardial side-effects. However, recent studies on isolated myocardial fibres showed the existence of a constant dose-dependent negative inotropic effect of dantrolene sodium, only noticeable with high concentrations of the drug.
A three-year old child was anaesthetized by halothane. Cardiac arrest occurred soon after the injection of suxamethonium. Signs of rhabdomyolysis associated with hyperkalemia were present. The diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy was obtained afterwards.
Intravenous methotrexate (IV-MTX), an effective treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), has a significant toxic effect on the central nervous system, with leukoencephalopathy (LE) being the most common form. The purpose of this study was to use objective quantitative MR imaging to prospectively assess the temporal evolution of LE extent and intensity.
Forty-five children (low-risk, 10 mol/L/12F; mean age, 5.0 years at diagnosis; standard/high-risk, 11 mol/L/12F; mean age, 9.2 years at diagnosis) treated for ALL on a single institutional protocol were evaluated longitudinally to assess the extent of LE (proportion of white matter impacted) through tissue segmentation and the relative intensity of LE through relative elevations in T1 and T2 relaxation rates. One-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess differences in quantitative measures at 4 different points in therapy both within and between risk arms.
The proportion of white matter affected in both patient groups increased significantly with additional courses of IV-MTX, whereas the intensity of LE also increased steadily; however, both the intensity and extent of LE declined significantly approximately 1.5 years after completion of IV-MTX. Increases in the T1 and T2 relaxation rates above normal-appearing white matter were significantly correlated with each other and were dependent on the proportion of white matter affected.
Higher doses and more courses of IV-MTX were associated with increased intensity and extent of LE. There was a significant reduction in both the intensity and extent of LE after completion of therapy. The impact of these changes on neurocognitive functioning and quality of life in survivors remains to be determined.
Commercial preparation of fungicides (captan and maneb), herbicides (bromacil, paraquat, picloram, and 2,4-D), and insecticides (carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, DDT, diazinon, carbofuran, and permethrin) were tested for their ability to induce complete and partial chromosome losses in Drosophila melanogaster males. In an attempt to identify the mutagenic activity of pesticides that are toxic in low concentrations in Drosophila, these males were mated with mus-302 repair-defective females. The rationale for this mating scheme is based on the repair of genetic damage in Drosophila sperm by maternal enzymes in the zygote, and on the reports that there may be increases in the frequency of recovery of chemically induced chromosome losses in crosses of treated males with mus-302 females. Verification of the sensitivity of this screen in this study came from significant increases in the frequency of chromosome loss induced by low concentrations of the positive controls, N-nitrosodimethylamine and methyl methanesulfonate. Of the 13 pesticides, the insecticide chlorpyrifos induced a significant amount of ring-X chromosome loss. No pesticide induced a significant increase in partial chromosome loss. These results are discussed in relation to the usefulness of repair-defective mutants in screens for genetic damage in Drosophila and other higher eukaryotes by chemicals that are toxic or cause sterility at low concentrations.
Mucosal ulceration and severe bone-marrow insufficiency with marked megaloblastic transformation occurred during treatment with triamterene in a patient with decompensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis and malnutrition. When the triamterene-containing preparation was stopped and folinic acid administered the haematological picture improved, but the patient died, with signs of hepatocellular insufficiency, of gastro-intestinal bleeding. The serum folic-acid level was markedly reduced due to the chronic malnutrition, while the vitamin B12 level was within normal limits. This observation indicates that when the pool of folic-acid coenzymes is reduced, triamterene can cause megaloblastic anaemia due to its folic-acid antagonism. Triamterene should, therefore, be given to patients with borderline folic-acid reservoirs, chronic alcoholism or during pregnancy, only under careful serial control of the blood picture.
Colchicum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn crocus or meadow saffron, contains the antimitotic colchicine, which binds to tubulin and prevents it forming microtubules that are part of the cytoskeleton in all cells.
A 71-year-old woman ate a plant she thought to be wild garlic (Allium ursinum). Ten hours later she arrived at the emergency department complaining of nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea. Ingestion of a poisonous plant was suspected and she was treated with gastric lavage, oral activated charcoal and an infusion of normal saline. Toxicology analysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed colchicine in the patient's gastric lavage, blood (5 microg/l) and urine (30 microg/l). She developed arrhythmias, liver failure, pancreatitis, ileus, and bone marrow suppression with pancytopenia. Alopecia began in the third week. Treatment was supportive only. Five months later she had no clinical or laboratory signs of poisoning.
The patient mistakenly ingested autumn crocus instead of wild garlic because of their great similarity. Colchicine primarily blocks mitosis in tissues with rapid cell turnover; this results in gastroenterocolitis in the first phase of colchicine poisoning, bone marrow hypoplasia with pancytopenia in the second and alopecia in the third, all of which were present in our patient. Colchicine toxicity in tissues without rapid cell turnover caused arrhythmias, acute liver failure and pancreatitis.
Colchicine poisoning can result in gastroenterocolitis followed by multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. In unexplained gastroenterocolitis after ingestion of wild plants as a salad or spice, especially when wild garlic is mentioned, we should always consider autumn crocus. Diagnosis could be confirmed only by toxicology analyses. Management of colchicine poisoning is restricted to supportive therapy.
ortho-Phthalaldehyde (OPA) has been used as a safe alternative disinfectant instead of glutaraldehyde; however, recently some adverse effects of OPA were reported in patients and medical professions. We examined the acute toxicity of OPA in male ICR mice injected with 0.125-0.5% OPA and killed some animals 1 day after a single OPA injection, and others 1 or 13 days after two OPA injections 5 days apart. Hematology, blood cell counts, specific antibody production, organ weights, hepatic enzymes, hepatic histopathology and gene expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) mRNA in liver were examined. Single OPA injections elevated leukocyte counts, the proportion of neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Two OPA injections dose-dependently increased leukocyte counts, the proportion of neutrophils, ALT and AST, and decreased alkaline phosphatase. Leukocyte counts and proportions of neutrophils normalized 13 days after the second of two injections. However, both ALT and AST remained high in mice given higher OPA doses. Significant increased liver-to-body weight ratio and mild hepatic lesions were observed. Gene expression of CYP1a1 and CYP2e1 revealed a tendency of up-regulation 1 day after two OPA injections. However, expression of these genes was then down-regulated 13 days after OPA injections. OPA induced specific IgE and IgG significantly in the sera, suggesting that OPA acts as a hapten. Overall, OPA caused acute inflammation and acted as a haptenic allergen, although it caused only mild liver injury. Such evidence suggested that careful washing and prevention of exposure were needed after OPA disinfection of medical instruments.
Genomic studies of cannabis use disorders have been limited. The cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CNR1) on chromosome 6q14-15 is an excellent candidate gene for cannabis dependence due to the important role of the G-protein coupled receptor encoded by this gene in the rewarding effects of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Previous studies have found equivocal evidence for an association between SNPs in CNR1 and a general vulnerability to substance use disorders. We investigate the association between 9 SNPs spanning CNR1 and cannabis dependence in 1,923 individuals. Two SNPs that were previously associated with cannabis dependence in other studies were also significant with this phenotype in our analyses [rs806368 (P = 0.05) and rs806380 (P = 0.009)]. Haplotype analyses revealed the association to be largely driven by the SNP rs806380. These results suggest a role for the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene in cannabis dependence.
Guanfacine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, was compared with clonidine as step-2 therapy of mild to moderate essential hypertension in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel evaluation to determine efficacy, safety and occurrence of withdrawal syndrome. During a 5-week period, patients were weaned from current antihypertensives, if any, and stabilized on step-1 therapy with 25 mg of chlorthalidone once a day. Those with a diastolic blood pressure (BP) from 95 to 114 mm Hg while taking chlorthalidone were randomized to treatment. The 2 agents had equal efficacy; 149 of 270 patients treated with guanfacine (55%) and 164 of 276 treated with clonidine (59%) achieved goal diastolic BP of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. Terminations because of adverse effects were relatively low. Dry mouth (30% of guanfacine and 37% of clonidine groups) and somnolence (21% of guanfacine and 35% of clonidine groups, p less than 0.05) were reported most frequently. Nonsyncopal dizziness was reported in 11% of guanfacine-treated and 8% of clonidine-treated patients. This difference was not statistically significant. To evaluate the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome in 316 outpatients and 156 inpatients, vital signs were monitored at least twice a day for up to 7 days after the end of therapy. Segmented 24-hour urine studies were performed on inpatients. Abrupt withdrawal of clonidine produced a rapid increase in diastolic and, especially, systolic BP, whereas guanfacine withdrawal produced more gradual increases. The differences were significant over the first 3 withdrawal days. It is concluded that guanfacine is a safe, effective, second-generation alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
More often we are faced with the cases of young people (who are in a serious condition) who land in ICU, because of severe narcotics intoxication, which they took occasionally on the concerts, discotheques and social events. From 1997 we observed rapid increase of admission to hospitals due to amphetamine, MDMA (2,3-methylenedeoxymethamphetamine which is a main component of a tablet called ecstasy) and THC (9-d tetrahydrocannabinols which are a component of sunn hemps) intoxication and decrease of opioid's poisoning. 23 years old patient was admitted to ICU in critical condition after severe narcotics intoxication. Patient was deeply unconscious (GCS 3) with tetraplegia and high temperature (39.6 degrees C). He had endotracheal tube (artificially ventilated) and hypovolemic shock with circulatory insufficiency (blood pressure was supported by 3 catecholamines). We observed many petechias and ecchymoses which suggested vascular haemorrhagic diathesis. It was found that the patient had disseminated intravascular coagulation and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure which was treated by dialysis. After 26 days of intensive treatment the patient was conscious, he had also efficient circulatory and respiratory system but with slight improvement of neurological state. In this condition he was admitted on nephrology ward to continue the treatment and start rehabilitation. The presence of high concentration of amphetamine, MDMA and THC in blood, extreme dehydration and electrolytes disturbances caused rhabdomyolysis, DIC syndrome and acute renal failure which make the prognosis worse and complicate the treatment. Estimating probability of death of this patient in SAPS II scale (Simplified Acute Physiology Scale) he has bad prognosis (86 points gives 95% of death probability). The patient is alive (what is a big success), probably thanks to quick arrival to specialized medical centre and dialysis treatment which was started early.
As of today, advanced non-small cell lung cancer is still an incurable disease. However, recent researches on the biology of adenocarcinoma have led to considerable progress in the treatment of this subgroup of patients. The administration of bevacizumab and pemetrexed as first-line therapy, erlotinib in the maintenance phase and erlotinib again combined with vandetanib as second-line therapy, gives patients with lung adenocarcinoma new hope. In particular, in metastatic adenocarcinoma with an EML4-ALK fusion oncogene, crizotinib (a selective, ATP-competitive, small molecule, orally bioavailable inhibitor of the ALK and MET/HGF receptor tyrosine kinases), led to a response rate of 64%, which is similar to the results achieved in chronic myeloid leukemia and GIST with imatinib. Overall, the application of all available active therapies during the natural history of adenocarcinoma may lead to a survival benefit that was unimaginable only a few years ago. This article reviews the main studies on molecular targeted therapies in various lines of treatment of advanced lung adenocarcinoma.
We describe the case of a 35-year old male who developed acute renal failure following high dose methotrexate therapy for Burkitt's non Hodgkin lymphoma. Serum methotrexate levels reached 37 micromol/l, and remained higher than 1 micromol/l for more than a week. Folinic acid rescue was intensified to 200-400 mg intravenously every 4 hours. As methotrexate binds markedly to proteins, plasma exchange was initially chosen, 4 sessions being performed from day 2 to day 4. The methotrexate pharmacokinetic profile was not significantly modified during plasma exchange, and serum drug level was 3 micromol/l. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was therefore performed from day 5 to day 10. This procedure also seemed ineffective, with evidence of low ultrafiltrate clearance. No extrarenal toxicity was observed in our patient. Thus, conventional extrarenal procedures appear to have a limited role in the setting of overexposure to methotrexate. The use of very high doses of folinic acid in our case probably played a major role in the eventual favorable outcome.
We report a case of symptomatic cytomegalovirus cystitis associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome related complex. The diagnosis of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome was established by bladder biopsy. The hematuria resolved after systemic acyclovir therapy. The other known urological manifestations of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome are discussed.
Whether selective factor IXa inhibition produces an appropriate anticoagulant effect when combined with platelet-directed therapy in patients with stable coronary artery disease is unknown. REG1 consists of RB006 (drug), an injectable RNA aptamer that specifically binds and inhibits factor IXa, and RB007 (antidote), the complementary oligonucleotide that neutralizes its anti-IXa activity.
We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic profile of REG1 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, assigning 50 subjects with coronary artery disease taking aspirin and/or clopidogrel to 4 dose levels of RB006 (15, 30, 50, and 75 mg) and RB007 (30, 60, 100, and 150 mg). The median age was 61 years (25th and 75th percentiles, 56 and 68 years), and 80% of patients were male. RB006 increased the activated partial thromboplastin time dose dependently; the median activated partial thromboplastin time at 10 minutes after a single intravenous bolus of 15, 30, 50, and 75 mg RB006 was 29.2 seconds (25th and 75th percentiles, 28.1 and 29.8 seconds), 34.6 seconds (25th and 75th percentiles, 30.9 and 40.0 seconds), 46.9 seconds (25th and 75th percentiles, 40.3 and 51.1 seconds), and 52.2 seconds (25th and 75th percentiles, 46.3 and 58.6) (P<0.0001; normal 25th and 75th percentiles, 27 and 40 seconds). RB007 reversed the activated partial thromboplastin time to baseline levels within a median of 1 minute (25th and 75th percentiles, 1 and 2 minutes) with no rebound increase through 7 days. No major bleeding or other serious adverse events occurred.
This is the first experience of an RNA aptamer drug-antidote pair achieving inhibition and active restoration of factor IXa activity in combination with platelet-directed therapy in stable coronary artery disease. The preliminary clinical safety and predictable pharmacodynamic effects form the basis for ongoing studies in patients undergoing elective revascularization procedures.
Disease recurrence after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) remains common, making improvements in conditioning regimens desirable. A dose-response relationship between busulfan exposure and outcome is known. Using individual real-time monitoring of the busulfan area under the curve (AUC), we aimed to determine the maximum-tolerated busulfan AUC in a conditioning regimen with fludarabine/alemtuzumab. Thirty-six patients with advanced hematologic malignancies were treated. Busulfan levels after a test dose and conditioning dose 1 allowed targeting of subsequent AUCs and dose-escalation above the starting AUC of 4800 µmol-min/L. Clearance of busulfan test doses was not always sufficiently predictive of treatment dose AUC and, on average, test dose clearance was faster than treatment dose clearance. When the study was modified to use conditioning dose 1 pharmacokinetics instead, accurately targeted treatment AUCs were achieved, and dose-escalation was possible. Severe, late-occurring sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) was the dose-limiting toxicity seen in 5/8 patients at an AUC level of 6800 µmol-min/L. The risk for SOS/VOD correlated with the highest observed AUC (AUC(max)) rather than with the average cumulative AUC (AUC(avg)). Busulfan dose-escalation to a maximum-tolerated AUC of 5800 µmol-min/L-higher than that achieved by current standard busulfan regimens-was accurate and achievable using real-time pharmacokinetics monitoring of the first conditioning dose. This AUC is now being studied in phase II for patients receiving busulfan/fludarabine/alemtuzumab as alloHCT conditioning.
Evidence that mothers report higher levels of drinking retrospectively than during pregnancy has led some investigators to suggest that women systematically underreport alcohol antenatally and that alcohol-related deficits may actually reflect heavier prenatal exposure. This study is the first to compare the validity of antenatal and retrospective reports of pregnancy drinking, drug use, and smoking in relation to effects on infant neurobehavioral outcomes.
Three hundred fifty-four inner-city mothers were interviewed regarding their alcohol, drug use, and smoking during pregnancy and retrospectively at 13 months' postpartum. Their infants were assessed at 6.5, 12, and 13 months on a large battery of neurobehavioral assessments.
Although higher levels of alcohol were reported retrospectively, the correlations of prenatal alcohol exposure with infant outcome were as strong or stronger for the antenatal measures and only the antenatal reports predicted poorer cognitive performance on the Bayley Scales and symbolic play, slower processing speed on the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence and cross-modal transfer, and slower infant reaction time. Women also reported higher levels of cocaine and marijuana but not cigarette smoking retrospectively. Relations between cocaine use and smoking on birth size and gestational age were as strong for either report. No effects were detected in relation to either report of marijuana use during pregnancy.
These findings suggest that antenatal alcohol interviews provide the most valid information and demonstrate the importance of assessing prenatal alcohol use during pregnancy to minimize the risk of failing to detect neurobehavioral deficits. Adverse effects were consistently seen at levels as low as 0.5 oz absolute alcohol/day (the equivalent of 7 drinks per week) based on maternal antenatal report. These data suggest that alcohol-related deficits do not reflect heavier prenatal exposure than that reported during pregnancy and that threshold values derived from antenatal reports are reasonably accurate.
