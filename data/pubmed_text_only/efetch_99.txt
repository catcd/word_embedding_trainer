To report 2 cases of transitory cerebellar ataxia related to lidocaine administered topically for endoscopy. case summaries: Two patients developed transitory cerebellar ataxia a few minutes after local anesthesia using lidocaine 10% spray and lidocaine 2% orally for a bronchoscopy and transesophageal echocardiography. This effect completely disappeared in 3-5 hours. In neither case was an alternate etiology of cerebellar ataxia identified. The second patient had previously experienced a similar reaction to lidocaine.
Several central neurologic effects of lidocaine have been reported, but until now, only few cases of cerebellar ataxia. In these 2 cases, the Naranjo probability scale indicated that a probable and a highly probable relationship existed between lidocaine administration and the transitory cerebellar ataxia.
Cerebellar ataxia may occur after local anesthesia with lidocaine; therefore, care must be taken to avoid overdose, even when administered topically.
Hedgehog signaling plays an essential role in patterning of the vertebrate skeleton. Here we demonstrate that conditional inactivation of the Kif3a subunit of the kinesin-2 intraflagellar transport motor in mesenchymal skeletal progenitor cells results in severe patterning defects in the craniofacial area, the formation of split sternum and the development of polydactyly. These deformities are reminiscent of those previously described in mice with deregulated hedgehog signaling. We show that in Kif3a-deficient mesenchymal tissues both the repressor function of Gli3 transcription factor and the activation of the Shh transcriptional targets Ptch and Gli1 are compromised. Quantitative analysis of gene expression demonstrates that the Gli1 transcript level is dramatically reduced, whereas Gli3 expression is not significantly affected by kinesin-2 depletion. However, the motor appears to be required for the efficient cleavage of the full-length Gli3 transcription factor into a repressor form.
To describe a case of intermittent visceral angioedema associated with long-term enalapril use.
A 72-year-old white woman developed severe abdominal pain as a result of visceral angioedema associated with long-term enalapril therapy. She had been taking enalapril 20 mg/day for 9 years prior to the first reported episodes of abdominal pain.
Visceral angioedema associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is a documented adverse effect. However, onset of symptoms has never been reported after 9 years of use. Not until 2 years after initial presentation were the symptoms correlated to enalapril administration. Since discontinuation of enalapril, the patient has not reported any symptoms for >2 years. An objective causality assessment categorized this adverse drug event as a result of enalapril as possible.
Development of angioedema from ACE inhibitors occurs in <1% of the population. Limited case reports have identified intermittent visceral angioedema from ACE inhibitors. However, it is important to recognize that this adverse effect can also occur in patients who have been treated with ACE inhibitor therapy for several years.
With the increased occurrence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections, linezolid treatment might be administered more often. New rare adverse events are likely to follow.
A 65-year-old man (weight, 91 kg; height, 185 cm) presented to the emergency department at the University of Virginia-affiliated Salem Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salem, Virginia, after a recent (8 weeks) kidney transplantation with a 24-hour history of fatigue, chills, arthralgias, increased urinary frequency, and onset of tongue discoloration. Two days before admission, he completed a 14-day course of linezolid 600 mg PO BID for ampicillin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infection. He was afebrile on admission and the dorsal aspect of his tongue was blackened centrally, browner peripherally, with normal pink mucosa on the periphery. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, the calculated score for tongue discoloration as a drug-related adverse event was 7 out of a maximum score of 13 points, designating it as a probable cause. The patient's tongue discoloration improved moderately during the hospital stay and resolved 6 months after the discontinuation of linezolid.
We report a rare association of linezolid and tongue discoloration in an elderly kidney transplant recipient that improved with discontinuation. We present this case to increase clinicians' awareness of the potential adverse event.
Evidence has accumulated indicating that microglia within the spinal cord play a critical role in morphine tolerance. The present study investigated the effects and possible mechanisms of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator resveratrol and AICAR to inhibit microglial activation and to limit the decrease in antinociceptive effects of morphine.
The microglial cell line BV-2 was used. Cytokine expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell signalling was assayed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The antinociception and morphine tolerance were assessed in CD-1 mice using the hot plate and tail-flick tests.
(1) Morphine induces robust BV-2 cell activation, as evidenced by increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, nuclear factor-κB translocation and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α], inducible nitric oxide synthase and Toll-like receptor-4, and these changes are inhibited by resveratrol. (2) Resveratrol activates AMPK to suppress morphine-induced BV-2 cell activation. AICAR, another AMPK activator, can mimic the effects of resveratrol, whereas compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, reverses the inhibitory effects of resveratrol treatment. (3) Systemic or spinal administration of resveratrol with morphine significantly blocks microglial activation in the spinal cord and then attenuates the development of acute and chronic morphine tolerance in both male and female mice.
Resveratrol directly suppresses morphine-induced microglial activation through activating AMPK, resulting in significant attenuation of morphine antinociceptive tolerance.
Previously we showed that bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental estrogenic endocrine disruptor, rapidly altered Ca(2+) handling and promoted arrhythmias in female rat hearts. The underlying molecular mechanism was not known. Here we examined the cardiac-specific signaling mechanism mediating the rapid impact of low-dose BPA in female rat ventricular myocytes. We showed that protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) signaling pathways are the two major pathways activated by BPA. Exposure to 1 nM BPA rapidly increased production of cAMP and rapidly but transiently increased the phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptors by PKA but not by CAMKII. BPA also rapidly increased the phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN), a key regulator protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) reuptake, by CAMKII but not PKA. The increase in CAMKII phosphorylation of PLN was mediated by phospholipase C and inositol trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release, likely from the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) storage. These two pathways are likely localized, impacting only their respective target proteins. The rapid impacts of BPA on ryanodine receptors and PLN phosphorylation were mediated by estrogen receptor-β but not estrogen receptor-α. BPA's rapid signaling in cardiac myocytes did not involve activation of ERK1/2. Functional analysis showed that PKA but not CAMKII activation contributed to BPA-induced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak, and both PKA and CAMKII were necessary contributors to the stimulatory effect of BPA on arrhythmogenesis. These results provide mechanistic insight into BPA's rapid proarrhythmic actions in female cardiac myocytes and contribute to the assessment of the consequence and potential cardiac toxicity of BPA exposure.
The effects of methylphenidate on four boys diagnosed as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette's syndrome (TS) were examined under single-blind, placebo-controlled conditions. Clinical ratings and playroom observations showed improvement in ADHD symptoms with methylphenidate. Results also indicated that methylphenidate had no untoward effects on the frequency of tic occurrence. In all four children, the highest dose resulted in improved classroom ratings of tics compared with initial placebo treatment. In three cases, mild tic exacerbation was reported for a lower dose. Because variability of tic status was observed in the experimental conditions, the findings suggest the possibility that tic response was independent of clinical doses of methylphenidate. The findings were also consistent with the theory that methylphenidate, a dopamine agonist, might effect tic status by altering dopamine receptor sensitivity. Further investigation of these effects is indicated, given the efficacy of methylphenidate in treating ADHD symptoms of TS patients.
The cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CYSLTR2) gene on chromosome 13q14.12-q21.1 encodes a receptor for CYSLTs, potent biological mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma, particularly that associated with aspirin intolerance (AIA). In an effort to discover additional polymorphism(s), the variant(s) of which have been implicated in asthma and aspirin intolerance, we scrutinized genetic polymorphisms of the CYSLTR2 gene, and evaluated this locus as a potential candidate for asthma.
DNA sequencing in 24 Koreans of the 5-kb region of the CYSLTR2 gene, including the approximately 1500-bp promoter region, revealed four sequence variants: one in the 5'-flanking region (c.-819T>G), two in the 3'-flanking region (c.2078C>T and c.2534A>G), and one downstream of the gene (c.2545+297A>G). The SNP frequencies were 0.499 (c.-819T>G), 0.351 (c.2078C>T), 0.429 (c.2534A>G), and 0.088 (c.2545+297A>G), and five haplotypes were constructed. The SNPs and haplotypes were not associated with risk of asthma development, but were significantly associated with aspirin intolerance. The frequencies of rare alleles on c.-819T>G, c.2078C>T, and c.2534A>G were higher in subjects with AIA than in subjects with aspirin-tolerant asthma (P=0.013-0.031). Asthmatics who had rare alleles for c.-819T>G, c.2078C>T or c.2534A>G exhibited a more pronounced fall in FEV1 after aspirin provocation than did those who carried the common allele (P=0.03-0.009). Asthmatics carrying ht2 (TTGA) also showed a more pronounced decrease in FEV1% after aspirin provocation than those carrying ht1 (GCGA) (P=0.006). These associations were even stronger when combined with LTC4S polymorphisms (-444A>C [c.-444A>C]) gene.
CYSLTR2 polymorphisms are associated with aspirin intolerance in asthmatics.
We describe the case of a 13-year-old boy with stage I hypopigmented mycosis fungoides in whom minimal residual disease was detected with T-cell receptor gamma-polymerase chain reaction after the disease was in complete clinical remission. We further cloned and sequenced the T-cell receptor gamma-polymerase chain reaction product of the lesion in remission and found that the original T-cell clone still existed in decreased amounts. The patient was followed up for 3 1/2 years without any new lesions developing. The clinical significance of this residual malignant T-cell clone in mycosis fungoides remains to be elucidated.
Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succinylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase. Adequate spontaneous respiration was re-established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection. In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase. In three patients none of the usual variants were found. It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze succinylcholine. The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist.
Carboplatin is regarded as a non-ototoxic or low-grade ototoxic chemotherapeutic agent.
We report on three patients with a recurrence of testicular cancer after cisplatin chemotherapy who suffered hearing loss after subsequent high-dose carboplatin therapy.
Audiometry demonstrated carboplatin-induced hearing loss primarily in the mid-range and high frequencies up to 45 dB at 3 kHz and up to 55 dB at 8 kHz. In two of three patients, transitory-evoked otoacoustic emissions were absent after carboplatin therapy.
Following first-line cisplatin chemotherapy, salvage treatment with high-dose carboplatin can generate hearing loss in the middle and high frequencies.
Motor seizures elicited by isonicotinehydrazide (INH) were studied in 188 male albino rats aged from 5 days to adulthood. INH was found to be able to induce both minimal, predominantly clonic, and major, i.e. generalized, tonic-clonic seizures during the whole course of development. Tonic hindlimb extension was observed as a part of major seizures even in the youngest group studied. Fifty-percent convulsant doses counted in 7-, 12-, 18-, 25- and 90-day-old rats did not significantly differ. The developmental changes found were a poor time resolution of minimal and major seizures during the first two postnatal weeks and significantly longer latency of major seizures in 5- and 7-day-old rat pups in comparison with all other age groups. The importance of the developmental stage of a generator of seizures as well as of the maturation of triggering mechanisms was demonstrated comparing the present results with our previous data.
An 11-year-old boy with a history of behavioral problems was admitted to the inpatient Child Development Program of St. Louis University Medical Center. A diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome was made, and when family objected to a trial of haloperidol for fear of tardive dyskinesia, clonidine was initiated. A temporary period of worsening of motor and phonic tics ensued, while dose adjustments were made. When a maintenance level was achieved, approximately 2 weeks after initiating treatment, remission of symptoms was observed.
The role of the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in mediating dopamine receptor antagonist-induced catalepsy in the rat was investigated. Five days after bilateral lesions of EP and STN respectively with the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (15, 30 nmol/0.5 microliter/side and 24 nmol/0.5 microliter/side, respectively) rats were injected intraperitoneally with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg) or the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg). Complete EP lesions prevented both SCH 23390- and haloperidol-induced catalepsy. STN lesions exerted pronounced anticataleptic effects in case of haloperidol-induced catalepsy, but less pronounced in case of SCH 233390-induced catalepsy. Further characterization of these anticataleptic effects in an open field demonstrated, that neither EP- nor STN lesions reversed bradykinesia, which occurred after selective dopamine receptor blockade. In conclusion, both EP and STN participate in the mediation of catalepsy induced by dopamine D1- and dopamine D2 receptor antagonists. Thereby these nuclei preferentially mediate rigidity and akinesia, but to a lesser extent bradykinesia.
Cadmium (Cd) is classified as a human carcinogen probably associated with epigenetic changes. DNA methylation is one of epigenetic mechanisms by which cells control gene expression. Therefore, the present study genome-widely screened the methylation-altered genes in the liver of rats previously exposed to low-dose Cd.
Rats were exposed to Cd at 20 nmol/kg every other day for 4 weeks and gene methylation was analyzed at the 48(th) week with methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-CpG island microarray. Among the 1629 altered genes, there were 675 genes whose promoter CpG islands (CGIs) were hypermethylated, 899 genes whose promoter CGIs were hypomethylated, and 55 genes whose promoter CGIs were mixed with hyper- and hypo-methylation. Caspase-8 gene promoter CGIs and TNF gene promoter CGIs were hypermethylated and hypomethylated, respectively, along with a low apoptosis rate in Cd-treated rat livers. To link the aberrant methylation of caspase-8 and TNF genes to the low apoptosis induced by low-dose Cd, mice were given chronic exposure to low-dose Cd with and without methylation inhibitor (5-aza-2'-deoxyctidene, 5-aza). At the 48(th) week after Cd exposure, livers from Cd-treated mice displayed the increased caspase-8 CGI methylation and decreased caspase-8 protein expression, along with significant increases in cell proliferation and overexpression of TGF-β1 and cytokeratin 8/18 (the latter is a new marker of mouse liver preneoplastic lesions), all which were prevented by 5-aza treatment.
These results suggest that Cd-induced global gene hypermethylation, most likely caspase-8 gene promoter hypermethylation that down-regulated its expression, leading to the decreased hepatic apoptosis and increased preneoplastic lesions.
Animal models in which seizures are elicited by chemical or electrical means are commonly used for identification and preclinical testing of novel antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Such models have been successful in discovering all the new AEDs. However, despite the high efficacy of AEDs against elicited seizures in rodent models, a significant proportion of epilepsy patients with spontaneous recurrent seizures is resistant to these drugs. It is not known whether drug testing in rodent models with spontaneous recurrent seizures would yield a more predictive result with respect to AED efficacy in the clinic. This led us to test one of the novel AEDs, levetiracetam (LEV), in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with spontaneous recurrent seizures.
Wistar rats were subjected to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and recorded for spontaneous recurrent seizures in the months after pilocarpine treatment. A group of rats with frequent spontaneous seizures was used for the drug trial with LEV. The experimental protocol for drug testing in these rats was as follows. For 2 weeks, rats received subcutaneous implantation of osmotic minipumps filled with saline (predrug control period), followed by a 2-week period with implantation of LEV-filled minipumps (drug period), after which pumps were replaced by drug-free pumps for 2 weeks (postdrug control period). The LEV concentration in the pumps during the drug period was adjusted to give daily doses resulting in the maximal plasma concentration range determined previously in patients with TLE during prolonged treatment with LEV. During the 6 weeks of the experiment in epileptic rats, seizures were recorded by video monitoring.
Average seizure frequency during the pre- and postdrug control period in a group of eight epileptic rats was 21 and 25 seizures. This was reduced to an average seizure frequency of 8 seizures during the 2 weeks of treatment with LEV. However, the individual response of rats to LEV varied markedly from complete seizure control to no effect at all, although plasma drug levels were within the therapeutic range in all rats. When seizure frequency was separately calculated for the first and second week of treatment, the significant anticonvulsant effect determined in the first week was partially diminished in the second week, suggesting that tolerance may have developed in some of the rats.
The data demonstrate that interesting results can be obtained by drug testing in epileptic rats, giving a more realistic prediction of clinical efficacy than results from drug testing in animal models with elicited seizures. Thus, although drug trials in rats with spontaneous recurrent seizures are laborious and time-consuming, such trials should be added to the preclinical characterization of novel AEDs.
Although it is well known that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in lung cancer progression, whether EGFR contributes to lung epithelial cell transformation is less clear. Mucin 1 (MUC1 in human and Muc1 in animals), a glycoprotein component of airway mucus, is overexpressed in lung tumors; however, its role and underlying mechanisms in early stage lung carcinogenesis is still elusive. This study provides strong evidence demonstrating that EGFR and MUC1 are involved in bronchial epithelial cell transformation. Knockdown of MUC1 expression significantly reduced transformation of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells induced by benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the active form of the cigarette smoke (CS) carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)s. BPDE exposure robustly activated a pathway consisting of EGFR, Akt and ERK, and blocking this pathway significantly increased BPDE-induced cell death and inhibited cell transformation. Suppression of MUC1 expression resulted in EGFR destabilization and inhibition of the BPDE-induced activation of Akt and ERK and increase of cytotoxicity. These results strongly suggest an important role for EGFR in BPDE-induced transformation, and substantiate that MUC1 is involved in lung cancer development, at least partly through mediating carcinogen-induced activation of the EGFR-mediated cell survival pathway that facilitates cell transformation.
Metastasis is the primary cause of death from breast cancer. Cell migration and invasion play important roles in neoplastic metastasis. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) stimulates cell migration through activation of PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. IGF-1 induces the tumorigenicity of many types of cancer cells and is critical for metastatic cell spread in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast-cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a key enzyme in the degradation of extracellular matrices and its expression has been dysregulated in breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Resveratrol exhibited potential anticarcinogenic activities in several studies. However, the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on the expression of MMP-2, migration and invasion of breast-cancer cell have not been demonstrated yet. In the present study, we investigated the anti-invasive mechanism of resveratrol in human breast cancer MDA-MB 435cells. Here, we showed that IGF-1 is a potent stimulant of the migration of ER-negative human breast-cancer cells. Resveratrol could inhibit IGF-1-mediated cell migration of MDA-MB 435 in vitro. The inhibitory effect of resveratrol was mediated in part through the suppression of the activation of PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, IGF-1-mediated expression of MMP-2 was significantly inhibited by resveratrol in concomitance with alteration of cell invasion.
The receptor tyrosine kinase/PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (RTK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway is frequently altered in cancer, but the underlying mechanism leading to tumorigenesis by activated mTOR remains less clear. Here we show that mTOR is a positive regulator of Notch signaling in mouse and human cells, acting through induction of the STAT3/p63/Jagged signaling cascade. Furthermore, in response to differential cues from mTOR, we found that Notch served as a molecular switch to shift the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. We determined that hyperactive mTOR signaling impaired cell differentiation of murine embryonic fibroblasts via potentiation of Notch signaling. Elevated mTOR signaling strongly correlated with enhanced Notch signaling in poorly differentiated but not in well-differentiated human breast cancers. Both human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and mouse kidney tumors with hyperactive mTOR due to tumor suppressor TSC1 or TSC2 deficiency exhibited enhanced STAT3/p63/Notch signaling. Furthermore, tumorigenic potential of cells with uncontrolled mTOR signaling was suppressed by Notch inhibition. Our data therefore suggest that perturbation of cell differentiation by augmented Notch signaling might be responsible for the underdifferentiated phenotype displayed by certain tumors with an aberrantly activated RTK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Additionally, the STAT3/p63/Notch axis may be a useful target for the treatment of cancers exhibiting hyperactive mTOR signaling.
Benzene was studied in its target organ of effect, the bone marrow, with the micronucleus test and metaphase analysis. Male and female CD-1 mice were treated with 2 doses of benzene (440 mg/kg) or toluene (860 or 1720 mg/kg) or both 24 h apart, and sacrificed 30 h (or 54 h) after the first dose. Benzene-treated animals were pretreated with phenobarbital (PB), 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MCA), SKF-525A, or Aroclor 1254. Toluene showed no clastogenic activity and reduced the clastogenic effect of benzene when the mixture was given. None of the pretreatments protected against the clastogenic effect of benzene. 3-MCA pretreatment greatly promoted benzene myeloclastogenicity. Females were consistently more resistant to benzene than males. Dose-response curves in benzene-treated mice were much steeper with 3-MCA induction than without. Chromosomal damage was higher with p.o. than i.p. benzene administration.
Thalidomide, when administered orally, is an inhibitor of angiogenesis in the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced rabbit cornea micropocket assay. We now show in the mouse that thalidomide given intraperitoneally but not orally significantly inhibits bFGF-induced and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced corneal neovascularization. We further demonstrate that this inhibition is independent from thalidomide's ability to suppress tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production. Experiments examining thalidomide's enantiomers reveal-that the S(-)-enantiomer has the strongest antiangiogenic activity in VEGF-induced and bFGF-induced corneal neovascularization. Structure activity studies suggest that thalidomide's anti-angiogenic activity is related to the open ring metabolites resulting from hydrolysis. Together these data support a correlation between thalidomide's antiangiogenic and teratogenic activities.
Myotonia permanens is associated with a G1306E mutation in the SCN4A gene. Two sporadic patients have been reported, but the clinical phenotype has not been fully characterized. The authors report a family in which the disease is autosomal dominantly inherited. The patients have severe myotonia, but the clinical picture is not qualitatively different from that seen in other nondystrophic myotonias.
Halofantrine, increasingly used for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, is a normally well-tolerated amino-alcohol with very few side-effects, but torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia due to halofantrine has been reported in a few patients with a congenital long QT interval (Romano-Ward syndrome). We performed a prospective study of the cardiac effect of halofantrine in 20 patients with 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring; the halofantrine levels in their serum were also determined. Minimal ECG changes were noted, with lengthening of the QT interval without clinical symptoms. This effect was dose-dependent and can be very severe in cases of pre-existing cardiopathy; it also occurs in patients without any pre-existing cardiopathy. In order to reduce the likelihood of such incidents, which are admittedly rare, we suggest performing electrocardiography on all patients before initiating treatment with halofantrine.
Liver tumors of the B6C3F1 mouse frequently contain mutations at specific sites of codon 61 of the Ha-ras proto-oncogene. To address whether these mutations occur early or late during carcinogenesis, we analyzed mutations in the Ha-ras gene in small precancerous liver lesions of the B6C3F1 mouse. For this purpose, 10-microns frozen liver sections were prepared and stained for glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Using punching cannuli, we then took small tissue samples of approximately 5-30 micrograms from enzyme-deficient liver lesions and from normal parts of the liver. These tissue samples were analyzed for mutations in the Ha-ras gene by in vitro amplification of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction combined with selective oligonucleotide hybridization. By this approach we were able to analyze mutations in the Ha-ras gene within lesions with diameters of less than 0.5 mm. Our results demonstrate that approximately 15% of the glucose-6-phosphatase-negative lesions that occurred 24-28 wk after a single injection of diethylnitrosamine contain either C----A transversions at the first base or A----G transitions and A----T transversions at the second base of codon 61 of the Ha-ras gene. The same types of mutations, although with a somewhat higher frequency (33%), were found in liver tumors taken 68 wk after diethylnitrosamine treatment. These findings demonstrate that Ha-ras mutations can be detected even in very small precancerous liver lesions, suggesting that these mutations may be an early, perhaps even the first, critical event during murine hepatocarcinogenesis.
The authors examine 18 cases of early dystonic syndromes and review all the pediatric cases published previously in order to determine the evolutive and epidemiological characters of these intolerance reactions. These unrecognized manifestations normally occur within the first 24 hours of treatment and disappear within a few hours when the treatment is discontinued. The use of diazepam and trihexyphenidyl accelerates the regression of the disorders. The doses of metoclopramide were mostly above the recommended doses, 60% of the cases correspond to doses in excess of 0.5 mg/kg per day or 0.2 mg/kg in a single dose. In the absence of overdosage, dystonic reactions occur essentially in female subjects aged over 9 years. For this part of the population, the possible occurrence of such a reaction should be mentioned to the family when the drug is prescribed.
