Imipramine, a widely used antidepressant, has rarely been associated with hepatic abnormalities. In the majority of reported cases, hepatic effects have been transient and readily reversible on discontinuation of the drug. We cared for an 11-year-old boy with hepatic failure and massive cell necrosis which followed treatment with imipramine for enuresis. This therapy led to fulminant hepatic failure and subsequent liver transplantation.
Rebound hypertension occurred in two patients upon clonidine withdrawal. Treatment of the hypertensive crisis consists of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, reserpine, or the reintroduction of clonidine. With effective control of pressure during the crisis, long-term antihypertensive therapy must be resumed.
A retrospective review was done of the charts of 50 persons admitted to hospital for investigation of primary anemia. The duration of hospital stay was considered excessive for 80% of the patients and investigation was considered excessive for 34%. Nevertheless, underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis by the time of discharge was evident in 48% and was the result of inadequate investigation or faulty analysis of the results or both. Even when the type of anemia was established, investigations to determine the cause of specific deficiencies were frequently inadequate. Understandably treatment was inadequate for undiagnosed or misdiagnosed conditions but it was also inadequate for many correctly diagnosed conditions. Parenteral administration of iron was prescribed more often than oral administration, and 30% of patients with iron deficiency anemia failed to receive iron by either route. Most patients with vitamin B12 deficiency anemia received treatment late. Blood transfusion was given to 40% of patients but could be justified in only 16%.
This report describes the rapid development of an amoebic liver abscess in a patient receiving prednisone by mouth for hypercalcaemia associated with sarcoidosis. The diagnosis and treatment of amoebiasis in this setting are discussed.
A 69-year old patient with high-grade malignant lymphoma experienced severe orthostatic hypotension during vincristine therapy. The symptoms disappeared when vincristine treatment was discontinued. The mechanism of the orthostatic hypotension is discussed.
We studied the role of endogenous opiates and their interrelationships with the sympathetic nervous system in an experimental preparation of right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) produced by surgical tricuspid avulsion and progressive pulmonary arterial constriction. Three groups of dogs with CHF and one group of sham-operated dogs were studied. One group of dogs with CHF was given normal saline as pretreatment, while the other two groups were pretreated with either propranolol alone (beta-blockade) or propranolol plus prazosin (alpha- plus beta-blockade). CHF was characterized by weight gain, ascites, elevated right atrial pressure, tachycardia, and reduced cardiac output. Compared with sham-operated animals, animals with CHF exhibited significantly higher baseline levels of plasma beta-endorphin and cortisol. Furthermore, only the animals with CHF responded to the opiate receptor-antagonist nalmefene with significant increases in plasma beta-endorphin, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Administration of nalmefene increased aortic blood pressure, cardiac output, left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P, and blood flow to the myocardium, skeletal muscle, and kidneys in dogs with CHF, but had no appreciable effects in sham-operated dogs. beta-Receptor blockade abolished the increase in cardiac output, left ventricular performance, and blood flow produced by nalmefene, but had no effect on the pressor response to nalmefene. The increase in mean aortic pressure in the beta-blockade group was accompanied by an increase in skeletal muscle vascular resistance. Addition of prazosin in the alpha- plus beta-blockade group abolished the increases in mean aortic pressure and skeletal muscle vascular resistance, suggesting that the changes after propranolol probably resulted from unmasking of alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Coagulopathy is a hallmark of severe ferrous sulfate poisoning in humans and laboratory animals. Although nontransferrin-bound Fe3+ is thought to initiate the disorder, little is known about how it interferes with blood coagulation. At iron concentrations comparable to those of previous animal investigations, we reproduced the coagulopathy, in other words, the dose-related prolongation of the prothrombin, thrombin, and partial thromboplastin time, in human plasma in vitro. Studies of the mechanism by which iron prevents a normal plasma coagulation revealed that the proenzymes of the coagulation cascade and fibrinogen were not damaged by iron. Fibrinogen coagulability and fibrin monomer aggregation were unaffected by very high iron concentrations. Instead, thrombin was markedly inhibited by iron in its clotting effect on fibrinogen and, specifically, in its fibrinopeptide A-generating capacity, the inhibitory effect being reversible upon iron removal by EDTA chelation and gel filtration. Thrombin generation in the presence of iron was reduced as well, indicating an inhibition of one or several other enzymes of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. Because the amidolytic activity of human thrombin as well as factor Xa, kallikrein, and bovine trypsin was also reversibly suppressed by ferrous sulfate as well as ferric citrate, we consider it likely that the coagulopathy occurring in iron poisoning is the consequence of a general, physiologically important phenomenon: the susceptibility of serine proteases to nontransferrin-bound Fe3+.
Previously, we have reported that in rat models of chronic pain, in particular, the very-high-efficacy 5-HT(1A) agonist F 13640 induces unprecedented pain relief by novel neuroadaptative mechanisms that involve inverse tolerance and cooperation with nociceptive stimulation in producing analgesia. The present studies detailed the actions of F 13640 and other compounds in the formalin model of tonic nociceptive pain. Intraperitoneal injection of F 13640 (0.01-2.5 mg/kg; t -15 min) caused a dose-dependent and complete inhibition of the paw elevation and paw licking that occurred both early (0-5 min) and late (22.5-27.5 min) after the intraplantar injection of diluted formaldehyde (2.5%) in the rat. The extent to which F 13640 and other 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands inhibited these pain behaviors correlated (p < 0.05) with the extent to which they activated 5-HT(1A) receptors. Under similar conditions, some inhibitory effects were also observed with various agents that are known to produce analgesia by different peripheral and/or central mechanisms (e.g., opioids, NA/5-HT reuptake inhibitors, COX-2 inhibitors and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gabapentin, and ABT-594). However, with the possible exception of morphine, the effects of all of these agents at nontoxic doses were lower than those of F 13640, in particular in inhibition of early paw elevation. The 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY 100635, but not naloxone, antagonized the actions of F 13640. These results help to establish large-magnitude 5-HT(1A) receptor activation as a new molecular mechanism of profound, central analgesia and suggest that F 13640 may be particularly effective against pain arising from severe tonic nociceptive stimulation.
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of serotoninergic neurotransmission and the effect of acute para-chlorophenylalanine (350 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) treatment on apomorphine-induced aggressive behaviour in adult male Wistar rats. In addition, [3H]ketanserin binding and monoamine content were studied. Repeated administration of apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously, once daily for two weeks) gradually induced aggressive behaviour. Acute p-chlorophenylalanine treatment down-regulated the [3H]ketanserin binding and reduced over 90 per cent the content of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid. In a half of the p-chlorophenylalanine-treated animals, the aggressive behaviour was suppressed, while there was no difference in [3H]ketanserin binding or monoamine content between the p-chlorophenylalanine treated aggressive and non-aggressive animals. In conclusion, the acute p-chlorophenylalanine treatment attenuates the aggressiveness only in half of the animals, while the latter phenomenon is independent on the CNS monoamine content or [3H]ketanserin binding.
We have designed a glycodendritic structure, BH30sucMan, that blocks the interaction between dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and Ebola virus (EBOV) envelope. BH30sucMan inhibits DC-SIGN-mediated EBOV infection at nanomolar concentrations. BH30sucMan may counteract important steps of the infective process of EBOV and, potentially, of microorganisms shown to exploit DC-SIGN for cell entry and infection.
Peripheral nerve toxicity has been reported but is not a commonly recognized complication of high dose cytosine arabinoside (HDAC) therapy. This study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence and describe the clinical spectrum of acute polyneuropathy associated with HDAC therapy for leukemia.
Records of 153 acute leukemia patients who received 194 courses of HDAC at the City of Hope were reviewed for evidence of severe peripheral neuropathy with onset 2-3 weeks after HDAC therapy.
Two patients were identified who developed motor disability 2-3 weeks after HDAC therapy, and the disability progressed in a monophasic course to quadriparesis. There was neurophysiologic evidence of peripheral nerve demyelination with slowed nerve conduction velocities and conduction block. One patient who was autopsied had demyelination identified in luxol-fast blue sections of peripheral nerve (with Bielschowsky-stained sections showing intact peripheral nerve axons). There were foamy macrophages in the peripheral nerve but no chronic inflammatory cells. For comparison, data from these two patients were combined with those from four published case reports of polyneuropathy associated with HDAC therapy. Quadriparesis occurred in five of six cases with the need for ventilatory support in four. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was elevated in five of six cases. Etiologic evidence incriminating HDAC included simultaneous cerebellar signs in two of six cases and a narrow interval of clinical onset after HDAC therapy.
Demyelinating polyneuropathy occurs in approximately 1% of HDAC courses and produces severe motor disability. HDAC immunosuppression could trigger an immune-mediated neuropathy; alternatively, a direct neurotoxic effect of HDAC on Schwann cells is also an etiologic possibility.
We previously found that lipoic acid (LA) improved high-fat diet (HFD)-induced dyslipidemia in rats. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of that effect, we carried out experiments aimed at analyzing biochemical parameters and gene expression profiles.
C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 8). The control group consumed an ordinary diet (4.89% fat, w/w). The other two experimental groups were fed with an HFD (21.45% fat, w/w) or an HFD plus 0.1% LA. After 6 wk, plasma lipid level and antioxidant status were examined. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LA on lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, we examined gene expression profiles in liver using the GeneChip microarray system. The differential expression of genes of interest identified by microarray technique was validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
HFD resulted in significant alterations in lipid profiles and a depressed antioxidant defense system. LA supplementation induced decreases in lipid peroxidation, plasma cholesterol, triacylglycerols, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an increase in high-density lipoprotein in HFD-fed mice. DNA microarray analysis of the liver showed that LA ingestion upregulated the expression of genes related to beta-oxidation and free radical scavenger enzymes, whereas those involved in cholesterol synthesis were downregulated.
LA can prevent HFD-induced dyslipidemia by modulating lipid metabolism, especially by increasing beta-oxidation and decreasing cholesterol synthesis, and oxidative stress by increasing those of free radical scavenger enzyme gene expression.
In pentobarbitalized closed-chest dogs, nicergoline (10--100 microgram/kg, i.v.) reduced blood pressure, heart rate, and splanchnic nerve activity. Intracisternal administration of nicergoline (3 microgram/kg) only reduced splanchnic nerve activity. In open-chest dogs, nicergoline reduced blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance but did not change heart rate. In pithed rats treated with a beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, nicergoline reduced the pressor responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. Nicergoline slightly attenuated the pressor responses of dogs to noradrenaline and tyramine and, in addition, reversed the hypertension induced by adrenaline and dimethylphenylpiperazinium. Nicergoline (100 microgram/kg) increased the tachycardia induced in dogs by stimulation of the right cardiovascular nerve and prevented the inhibitory effect of clonidine on this response. However, nicergoline only partially antagonized the effect of clonidine once it was fully established. Nicergoline did not antagonize the hypotensive and bradycardic effects of clonidine when they were established. Nicergoline did not affect the vagally mediated bradycardia evoked by carotid nerve stimulation in beta-adrenoceptor-blocked dogs. The compound did not change blood pressure in Cl spinal cord transected dogs. In conclusion, nicergoline appears to decrease blood pressure by blocking alpha-adrenoceptors and, at least at some doses, by a central inhibition of the sympathetic tone. Nicergoline appears to be a preferential alpha 1-adrenoceptor-blocking agent.
We have studied prospectively 600 patients who had spinal anaesthesia for minor surgery, to evaluate the incidence of transient radicular irritation after the block. The anaesthetic agent (hyperbaric 5% lignocaine, hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine or plain 0.5% bupivacaine) was chosen according to the anticipated duration of surgery. We obtained information after operation from 537 patients (282 by telephone, 255 by letter). Ten percent of patients anaesthetized with hyperbaric 5% lignocaine (27 patients) had transient bilateral radiating pain in the lower extremities, buttocks, or both. Typically the pain started within 24 h after spinal anaesthesia, lasted less than 2 days and was described as mild. Lignocaine was the only variable that correlated with this pain. Two patients complained of symptoms after hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine but these were atypical compared with pain after lignocaine. None of the patients anaesthetized with plain bupivacaine had similar complaints. We conclude that the use of 5% hyperbaric lignocaine for spinal anaesthesia should be reconsidered.
Beclomethasone dipropionate as a pressurized aerosol is effective in nasal polyposis, but the efficacy is only moderate. In these partly-blocked noses, it seems possible that the insufflated drug in powder form is better distributed over the mucous membrane than the pressurized aerosol. To test this hypothesis, we treated forty-two patients with nasal polyposis with intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate as a powder and as a pressurized aerosol in a double-dummy, cross-over design. There was no difference between the treatments in sixteen patients, while in twelve cases there was a preference for beclomethasone dipropionate as aerosol, and in fourteen, for the powder form. Fourteen found the aerosol most irritating and nineteen, the powder. Thus, in a group of polyp patients there were no significant differences between the two application forms, but possibly there is a need for both aerosol and powder, as there appeared to be differences in the individual responsiveness to the two types of intranasal medication. Blind microscopy of wiped nasal-smears before and after beclomethasone dipropionate treatment showed a reduction of basophilic cells, and counting of sneezes after medication demonstrated a reduction in the number of sneezes. These results suggest that a reduction of epithelial mediator-cells and of irritant receptor-sensitivity are of importance for the efficacy of topical steroids in rhinitis.
The mechanisms contributing to diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as the protective pathways of the kallikrein-kinin-system (KKS), are incompletely understood. In a kallikrein-overexpressing rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy, we investigated the involvement of inflammatory pathways, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Six weeks after STZ injection, impairment of left ventricular (LV) function parameters measured by a Millar-tip catheter (peak LV systolic pressure; dP/dtmax; dP/dtmin) was accompanied by a significant increment of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (CAMs) expression, as well as of beta2-leukocyte-integrins+ (CD18+, CD11a+, CD11b+) and cytokine (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta)-expressing infiltrates in male Sprague-Dawley (SD-STZ) rats compared with normoglycemic littermates. Furthermore, SD-STZ rats demonstrated a significant impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation evoked by acetylcholine and significantly increased plasma TBARS (plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) levels as a measure of oxidative stress. These diabetic cardiomyopathy-associated alterations were significantly attenuated (P<0.05) in diabetic transgenic rats expressing the human kallikrein 1 (hKLK1) gene with STZ-induced diabetes. CAMs expression, beta2-leukocyte-integrins+, and cytokine-expressing infiltrates correlated significantly with all evaluated LV function parameters. The multiple protective effects of the KKS in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy comprise the inhibition of intramyocardial inflammation (CAMs expression, beta2-leukocyte-integrins+ infiltration and cytokine expression), an improvement of endothelium-dependent relaxation and the attenuation of oxidative stress. These insights might have therapeutic implications also for human diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Prenatal ethanol exposure results in increased glucose production in adult rat offspring and this may involve modulation of protein acetylation by cellular stress. We used adult male offspring of dams given ethanol during gestation days 1-7 (early), 8-14 (mid) and 15-21 (late) compared with those from control dams. A group of ethanol offspring was treated with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) for 3 weeks. We determined gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase, hepatic free radicals, histone deacetylases (HDAC), acetylated foxo1, acetylated PEPCK, and C/EBP homologous protein as a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Prenatal ethanol during either of the 3 weeks of pregnancy increased gluconeogenesis, gluconeogenic genes, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses, sirtuin-2 and HDAC3, 4, 5, and 7 in adult offspring. Conversely, prenatal ethanol reduced acetylation of foxo1 and PEPCK. Treatment of adult ethanol offspring with TUDCA reversed all these abnormalities. Thus, prenatal exposure of rats to ethanol results in long lasting oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses explaining increased expression of gluconeogenic genes and HDAC proteins which, by deacetylating foxo1 and PEPCK, contribute to increased gluconeogenesis. These anomalies occurred regardless of the time of ethanol exposure during pregnancy, including early embryogenesis. As these anomalies were reversed by treatment of the adult offspring with TUDCA, this compound has therapeutic potentials in the treatment of glucose intolerance associated with prenatal ethanol exposure.
The regular use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) has been associated with depressed mood, anxiety and hostility, but it is not known whether such effects persist after people stop using the drug. Furthermore, little is known about what factors might influence the decision to quit using MDMA. The aim of the present study was to examine the reasons why ex-users had stopped using this drug and to assess their current levels of depression, anxiety, anger and aggression. Telephone interviews were conducted with people who used to take MDMA on a regular basis but who no longer used the drug. The participants comprised sixty-six ex-users who used to take MDMA regularly (at least once every 2 months over a period of at least 1 year), but who had not taken MDMA for at least 1 year (average 3 years). Participants were asked about why they had quit MDMA. They also completed questionnaires to assess trait mood. Ex-users could be divided into two groups based on their reason for quitting: (i) those who had quit for mental health reasons and (ii) those who had quit for circumstantial reasons. Approximately half of those in the mental health group scored in the range for clinical depression. In that group, current levels of depression and anxiety correlated significantly with the cumulative amount of MDMA that they had taken several years previously. These findings suggest that some users may either be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of MDMA or have pre-existing mental health problems for which they self-medicate by using ecstasy. The present study shows that some ex-users experience an impairment to mental health that persists for years after they stop using this drug.
Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19. As a result of these and other studies, phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries. However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4. These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves. A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone. Thus, acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations. The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed.
Adrenolytic heart defect (AHD) proceeds with the breaking of higher adaptational reactions, i.e. the change of latent period of conditioned active prevention reaction and arising of retrograde amnesia. alpha-Tocopherol--antioxidant prevents the breaking of conditioned reflex activity and sharply reduces the mortality rate in AHD. More effective is the prophylaxis of the brain function breaking and lethality.
The clinical features of two children of a family with rapidly progressive extrapyramidal-pyramidal-dementia complex have been described. Inheritance seems most likely to be autosomal recessive. Magnetic resonance imaging results of brain were negative. Even so, the authors argued in favor of a diagnosis of Hallervorden-Spatz disease because the cases fulfilled the clinical criteria for diagnosis of this disease. Apart from the negative magnetic resonance findings, the other unusual feature was the early development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Few conditions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a childhood-onset rapidly progressive extrapyramidal syndrome. Such conditions include Wilson's disease, Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD), juvenile form of Huntington's disease, juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, early-onset Machado-Joseph disease neuroacanthocytosis, storage disorders, and variant form of dopa-response dystonias (DRD). Rarer conditions are Leigh's disease, Lafora body disease, and dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy. HSD is a rare disorder characterized by progressive extrapyramidal dysfunction and dementia. Onset is most commonly in late childhood or early adolescence. The disease can be familial or sporadic. When familial, it is inherited recessively and has been linked to chromosome 20. Recently, a mutation in the pantothenate kinase (PANK2) gene on band 20pl3 has been described in patients with typical HSD. HSD produces typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in brain, aiding in antemortem diagnosis. The typical finding is of bilaterally symmetrical hyperintense signal changes in the external segment of globus pallidus, with surrounding hypointensity on T(2)-weighted image. These imaging features are fairly diagnostic and have been termed the "eye-of-the tiger sign". The hyperintensity represents pathologic changes, including gliosis, demyelination, neuronal loss, and axonal swelling, and the surrounding hypointensity is caused by loss of signal secondary to iron deposition. Described herein are the clinical aspects of a family with autosomal recessive inheritance with rapidly progressive extrapyramidal-pyramidal-dementia complex but with negative brain MRI results. The diagnosis should be considered a variant form of HSD.
The acute and chronic toxicities of streptomycin sulfate (SS) and of the streptomycin hydrochloride-calcium chloride complex (SCC) were compared. The LD50 determined in mice was significantly higher for SCC than for SS. Chronic toxicity was evaluated by recording the nystagmus induced by damped torsion pendulum in rabbits. SS and SCC treatments (200 mg/kg intramuscularly of absolute streptomycin base) decreased the duration, the maximal frequency, and the total number of beats of nystagmus. However, SCC-induced changes were significantly lower than SS-induced ones. The extent of the lesion in the crista ampullaris was evaluated by light and electron microscopy and was correlated with the electrophysiological findings. Because the authors also demonstrated that there are no differences in the antibacterial effects of these salts, SCC may have a place in long-term streptomycin treatment.
A 52-year-old female patient treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin and prednisone), broad spectrum antibiotics and amphotericin via a Hickman catheter placed in the superior vena cava, developed echocardiographically confirmed tricuspid regurgitation. A second admission four months later showed only mild tricuspid regurgitation. The authors conclude that the amphotericin given via the central line caused valvulitis of the tricuspid valve.
Evidence previously reported suggest that 1,3-butanediol (BD) enhances the hepatotoxic effect of a single small dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in a dose-related manner. The present study provides additional information concerning the quantitative relationship between the severity of the ketotic state produced by BD and the magnitude of the potentiation observed and emphasizes the use of ketone bodies (KB) to predict the potential hazard of the BD-CCl4 interaction. Liver damage was modulated in male Sprague-Dawley rats by varying the concentration of the BD solutions ingested prior to a CCl4 challenge (0.1 ml/kg, i.p.). These data were compared to ketone bodies in plasma, hepatic tissue and urine. BD produced a dose-dependent metabolic ketosis observable at dosages between 1.1 and 9.9 g/kg per day given for 7 days. Plasma and liver data correlated well together. Concomitantly, potentiation of the CCl4-induced liver injury was also dose-related for the same dosage range; the minimum effective dosage of BD for potentiation was estimated as 1.1 g/kg per day. The linear correlations between hepatic or plasma KB values and the indices of hepatic dysfunction (ALT, OCT) were highly significant. Using a semiquantitative method, a correlation was also found for the urinary KB data. These results suggest that plasma KB concentrations might be useful for predicting possible potentiation of the hepatonecrotic effect of CCl4 by BD.
Our previous studies have shown that angiotensin II increases carbonic anhydrase activity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study we investigated in vitro the effect of angiotensin II on carbonic anhydrase I and II from erythrocytes and on arteriolar vascular smooth muscle carbonic anhydrase I. We also studied in vitro and in vivo the effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers (irbesartan and candesartan) on purified carbonic anhydrase I and II, on vascular smooth muscle carbonic anhydrase I and on arterial blood pressure in humans and in animals. In vitro results showed that angiotensin II is a direct and stronger activator of carbonic anhydrase I than II. Angiotensin II receptor blockers reduced mainly carbonic anhydrase I activity and completely antagonized the activating effect of angiotensin II both on purified and on vascular smooth muscle carbonic anhydrase I. Our in vivo experiments showed that irbesartan and candesartan are powerful inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase I both in erythrocytes (in humans) and in vascular smooth muscles (in animals). In humans, irbesartan and candesartan progressively reduce arterial blood pressure in hypertensive subjects, in parallel with progressive reduction of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I activity. We believe that angiotensin II could have a dual mechanism of action: (1) angiotensin interacting with its receptor to form a stimulus-receptor complex; (2) the same stimulus directly acts on the carbonic anhydrase I isozyme (which might be coupled with angiotensin II receptors), ensuring an adequate pH for stimulus-receptor coupling for signal transmission into the cell and hence vasoconstriction.
