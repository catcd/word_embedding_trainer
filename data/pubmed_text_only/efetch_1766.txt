Extremity surgery with tourniquet to provide a bloodless field may be a good human model for ischaemia reperfusion (IR) injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three different modes of propofol use on tourniquet induced IR injury in lower extremity operations.
Thirty-three consecutive ASA Grade I and II patients were randomized into three groups of 11 patients each. In the spinal group (Group S), after intrathecal anaesthesia, sedation was given with a propofol infusion at 2 mg kg-1 h-1 after a 0.2 mg kg-1 bolus dose and fentanyl 100 microg. In the general (Group G) and TIVA (Group T) groups, general anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg kg-1 with fentanyl 100 microg and maintained with inhalation of halothane or infusion of propofol respectively. Venous blood samples were obtained at different time points for measurements of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels.
Plasma MDA levels were increased significantly in the Group G at 1 min before tourniquet release and 5 and 20 min after tourniquet release compared with before induction of general anaesthesia (baseline). Before intrathecal anaesthesia and before induction of general anaesthesia significantly decreased levels of MDA were observed both before and after tourniquet release compared to baseline. Plasma SOD and CAT concentrations were decreased significantly only at tourniquet release in the Group G compared with baseline. In the Groups S and T these enzymes were not changed significantly. Plasma GPx levels were not altered in any groups.
Propofol administration may inhibit lipid peroxidation and restore antioxidant enzyme levels in extremity surgery requiring tourniquet application.
To study effect of downregulation of c-myc gene expression with As2O3 on inducing Ec109 cell apoptosis.
MTT reduction assay, flowcytometric analysis, DNA gel electrophoresis, Western blot and in situ cell death detection (TUNEL).
The viability of the cells treated with As2O3 was decreased. The cells treated with As2O3 showed a typical apoptotic morphology and hypodiploid peak before G1 phase. DNA of treated Ec109 cells appeared a ladder pattern characteristic of apoptosis. TUNEL detection analysis also revealed the DNA fragmentation and As2O3 decreased c-myc gene expression was observed.
As2O3 can induce Ec109 cell apoptosis with downregulation of c-myc gene expression.
Thirty-one chronic psychotic patients were treated with loxapine succinate, 20 for two years and eleven for one year, in order to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety. Results presented here indicate that loxapine succinate is an effective treatment for chronic schizophrenia over a period of at least two years. Improvement, which occurred during the first six months of treatment (mostly during the first month), was maintained over the following year and a half. Unwanted effects were most frequent inthe early months of treatment and decreased as the two year trial progressed. No specifically long-term side effects were observed. The most frequent side effects were mild to moderate extrapyramidal signs. Blood pressure decreased and pulse rate increased, while remaining within normal limits, and returned to normal or near normal levels during the second year of treatment. Weight increased steadily during the two years and dropped markedly during the four week post-drug period. No drug-related abnormal laboratory findings were observed. It may be concluded that loxapine succinate is a safe and effective maintenance treatment for chronic schizophrenia.
Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting 1 out of 160 children in the United States today. Only risperidone has Food and Drug Administration approval for the pharmacologic management of autism in children. However, health care providers may prescribe other drugs used off-label to assist autistic children and their families with the core deficits and associated behaviors of this condition. Evidence for the use of these medications will be discussed in this continuing education offering. Meta analyses, randomized clinical trials, and other prospective experimental studies of pharmacotherapy conducted in the United States in the past 10 years in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years were reviewed. The results support moderate success in treating the associated behaviors of autism and minimal success in treating core deficits across all drug classes. Preliminary evidence demonstrates possible uses for atypical antipsychotic agents, selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors, stimulants, and N-methyl-D-aspirate receptor antagonists in decreasing the core behaviors and associated symptoms of autism. More studies and longer periods of follow-up are needed before definitive guidelines can be suggested.
Increased oxidative stress and apoptosis have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity that limits the clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) as an anti-tumoral drug, but the mechanism of DOX-mediated apoptosis remains unclear. We examined the interplay between oxidative stress and cell death in cardiac-derived H9c2 myocytes exposed to DOX doses in the range of the plasma levels found in patients undergoing chemotherapy. A low DOX concentration (0.25 microM) induced apoptosis, whereas the cells treated with the high dose of 2 microM also showed necrosis. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of oxidative stress markers was increased in the cells treated with 2 microM DOX but not in those treated with the low dose. Surprisingly, heme oxygenase (HO-1) expression was down-modulated in the cells exposed to 0.25 microM DOX, and its Bach 1 transcriptional repressor was induced. In line with the role of HO-1 as an anti-apoptotic protein, inhibiting HO-1 activity with SnPPIX was sufficient to induce apoptosis and increased DOX-mediated apoptosis, whereas hemin-induced HO-1 activation prevented DOX-mediated apoptotic cell death. In brief, our findings do not support the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays a role in the apoptotic cell death occurring in cardiomyocytes exposed to low concentrations of DOX, but suggest that DOX may facilitate the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic HO-1.
Nitrofurans compounds and derivatives demonstrate antineoplastic activity in vitro as well as in vivo. Nitrofurantoin caused in vitro growth inhibition of a FANFT-induced murine bladder tumor (MBT2) and a human transitional cell carcinoma cell line (GIBB) in concentrations of 125 microM, 250 microM and 500 microM. The implantation and growth of MBT2 in the cauterized mouse bladder was inhibited by 250 microM nitrofurantoin. The bladder mucosa of two groups of C3Hf/HeHa female mice was electrically cauterized. In group I, 1 X 10(6) MBT2 cells were injected into the bladders of 42 mice, while in group II 1 X 10(6) MBT2 cells in 250 microM nitrofurantoin solution were injected into the bladders of 51 mice. Positive tumor implantation was seen in 25 bladders (59.5 per cent) of group I as compared to 15 bladders (29.5 per cent) of group II. All tumors in group I were large, occupying more than 50 per cent of bladder cross sectional area with 24 per cent showing extravesical extention. Sixty-six per cent of tumors in groups II were less than 25 per cent of bladder cross sectional area and 13.4 per cent had extravesical extention.
Daily subcutaneous injections of pharmacological doses of 17 beta-estradiol (E2, 0.4 micrograms./gm. body weight) resulted in significant urinary retention in the bladder of castrated mice. Although the urinary retention developed in both male and female mice, the increase in urethral resistance to urinary flow and the dilatation of posterior urethra were observed only in castrated male mice receiving E2. Histological changes common to male and female mice were cornification and stratification of urethral epithelium and fibrosis of connective tissues surrounding the urethra, suggesting that these changes may cause the urinary retention. Although the exact mechanism has not been defined, the urinary retention produced by the present method may be useful as a model of human disease.
The vaginal contraceptive ring is a hormonal contraceptive that releases etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but serious complication of hormonal contraceptive use.
We present a case of CVST in a 33-year-old nulligravid woman who was using a vaginal contraceptive ring. At the time of presentation, she had been using the ring for 18 months, having previously used oral contraceptives for 13 years. She had no additional risk factors for thrombosis apart from cigarette smoking. Despite vigorous management, the patient died from the effects of the CVST.
The serious adverse effects of the vaginal contraceptive ring are not well known, although deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and aortic thrombosis in association with use of the ring have been reported to Health Canada. Continuing post-market surveillance of thrombotic risk in users of the vaginal contraceptive ring is critical.
In order to assess the safety of 1-h infusions of amphotericin B (AMB), we prospectively monitored 213 1-h infusions of AMB (dose range, 0.27 to 0.89 mg/kg of body weight) in 27 patients with creatinine clearances of > 25 ml/min. Holter monitor tracings during 1-h infusions were compared with those during a 4-h baseline period of monitoring. There were no ventricular dysrhythmias during 1-h infusions of AMB that were not present during baseline monitoring. Nausea and/or rigors were noted for 32 (15%) infusions in six (22%) patients. No patient exhibited a temperature rise of > 1 degree C. We conclude that, in doses of up to 0.9 mg/kg, AMB does not appear to induce asymptomatic ventricular dysrhythmias when administered over 1 h to patients with creatinine clearances of > 25 ml/min.
Since previous literature suggested that estrogen-treated male mice are models for human benign prostatic hypertrophy, a series of studies was designed to examine urine retention and urogenital tract changes in rodents given chronic estradiol-17 beta (E) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatments. In Study 1, intact and castrate male mice received E, DHT or E plus DHT for four weeks via subcutaneous Silastic capsules. Bladder urine volume increased in the groups given E and this effect was not altered by castration, DHT or removal of E capsules two weeks before necropsy. Estrogen treatment also increased mortality. In Study 2, intact male, intact female, adrenalectomized (Adx) male and sham Adx male mice received 16 weeks of steroid treatments. Bladder urine volume increased in all E treated groups regardless of sex or Adx. Hydronephrosis, hydroureter and increased mortality were found in the E treated mice of both sexes. Estrogen induced epithelial changes and edema of the prostate, vas deferens and the utriculus prostaticus. In further studies male rats, hamsters and guinea pigs were given several different dosages of E but no evidence of urine retention or increased mortality was found. Taken together these studies suggest that E-induced urine retention is unique to mice. Although urine retention and hydronephrosis found in the mice were similar to those in humans with BPH, the lesion that results in the urine obstruction is not similar.
Sinonasal osteocartilaginous necrosis induced by the abuse of inhaled cocaine must be considered in the differential diagnosis of those pathologies that produce facial midline destructions. We report two cases corresponding to women admitted in our Hospital because of such entity. There were analysed their respective clinical histories, exploration data, complementary tests, medical-surgical treatment and evolution. Cocaine is one of the drugs that has increased in last 10 years producing an elevated number of complications, as we could proved on the bibliographic review performed.
Fish oil (FO) supplementation could cause an increase in the concentration of plasmatic free fatty acids and, consequently, could compete with pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid (ARA) derived from brain biomembranes metabolism in the cerebrospinal fluid. Essential fatty acids (EFA) (n-3) have been reported by their antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, and therefore the influence of the FO supplementation on the reserpine-induced motor disorders was studied. Wistar rats were orally treated with FO solution for 5 days, and co-treated with reserpine (R; 1 mg/kg/mL) or its vehicle for 3 days (every other day). Reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and catalepsy (P < 0.05) were prevented by FO (P < 0.05). Biochemical evaluations showed that reserpine treatment increased the lipid peroxidation in the cortex and striatum (P < 0.05), while the FO supplementation prevented this oxidative effect in both brain regions (P < 0.05). Our results showed the protective role of FO in the brain lipid membranes, reinforcing the beneficial effect of n-3 fatty acids in the prevention of degenerative and motor disorders.
The expression of mRNA coding for prepro-thyrotropin releasing hormone (preproTRH) was estimated in the rat brain in two animal models of limbic seizures, evoked by systemic administration of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg ip) or kainate (12 mg/kg ip). As shown by an in situ hybridization study, after 24h both pilocarpine- and kainate-induced seizures profoundly increased the preproTRH mRNA level in the dentate gyrus. After 72h, the preproTRH mRNA level was back to control values. Kainate-treated rats showed an elevated level of TRH in the hippocampus, septum, frontal and occipital cortex after 24 and 72h, whereas in the striatum and amygdala the TRH level was raised after 72h only. In the hypothalamus, TRH levels was lowered after 3 and 24h, and returned to the control after 72h. Pilocarpine-induced seizures also elevated the TRH level after 72h in the majority of the above structures, except for the hypothalamus and amygdala where no changes were found at any time point. A radioreceptor assay showed that kainate decreased the Bmax value of TRH receptors in the striatum and hippocampus after 3 and 24h, respectively, and had no effect on the Kd values. In contrast, pilocarpine-induced seizures lowered the Bmax of TRH receptors in the striatum, hippocampus and piriform cortex after 72h only, and decreased Kd values in the striatum, amygdala and frontal cortex. These data showed that pilocarpine- and kainate-induced seizures enhanced likewise preproTRH mRNA in the dentate gyrus; on the other hand, they differed with respect to time- and structure-related changes in TRH tissue levels and TRH receptors. These differences may have functional significance in TRH-dependent control mechanism of the seizure activity in these two models of limbic epilepsy.
Atrial fibrillation affects an estimated 2.5 million Americans and incurs an average annual stroke risk of 4.5% per year. Despite warfarin reducing stroke risk by approximately 66%, prior studies show warfarin usage rates to be about 50%. However, the methods that define warfarin as "inappropriate underutilization" might not be sensitive enough to pick up relative contraindications. We assessed the inappropriate underutilization of warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients at our hospital by abstracting individual patient charts.
Medical records were reviewed to determine stroke risk factors, warfarin use, and documented contraindications to warfarin use in 364 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation.
Amongst 364 atrial fibrillation patients, 54.6% received warfarin anticoagulation. Overall, 29.5 % of patients had documented reasons for not prescribing warfarin. Primary reasons listed by treating physicians included: gastrointestinal bleed 10.7%, secondary/transient atrial fibrillation 8.2%, and fall risk 6.3%. Only 7.1% of the patients had no documented reasons for the lack of warfarin use.
Consistent with previous reports, 45.4% of patients in this atrial fibrillation cohort were not prescribed warfarin. However, after reviewing medical charts for documented reasons why warfarin was not used, the inappropriate underutilization rate was only 7.1%. These findings suggest that studies utilizing administrative database and ICD-9 CM coding might overestimate warfarin underutilization.
An increase in the frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion in vitro and a reduction in LH response to GnRH in vivo characterize hypothalamic-pituitary maturation before puberty in the female rat. In girls migrating for international adoption, sexual precocity is frequent and could implicate former exposure to the insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), since a long-lasting DDT derivative has been detected in the serum of such children. We aimed at studying the effects of early transient exposure to estradiol (E(2)) or DDT in vitro and in vivo in the infantile female rat. Using a static incubation system of hypothalamic explants from 15-day-old female rats, a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in GnRH interpulse interval (IPI) was seen during incubation with E(2) and DDT isomers. These effects were prevented by antagonists of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4 propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptors and estrogen receptor. Also, o,p'-DDT effects were prevented by an antagonist of the aryl hydrocarbon orphan dioxin receptor (AHR). After subcutaneous injections of E(2) or o,p'-DDT between Postnatal Days (PNDs) 6 and 10, a decreased GnRH IPI was observed on PND 15 as an ex vivo effect. After DDT administration, serum LH levels in response to GnRH were not different from controls on PND 15, whereas they tended to be lower on PND 22. Subsequently, early vaginal opening (VO) and first estrus were observed together with a premature age-related decrease in LH response to GnRH. After prolonged exposure to E(2) between PNDs 6 and 40, VO occurred at an earlier age, but first estrus was delayed. We conclude that a transient exposure to E(2) or o,p'-DDT in early postnatal life is followed by early maturation of pulsatile GnRH secretion and, subsequently, early developmental reduction of LH response to GnRH that are possible mechanisms of the subsequent sexual precocity. The early maturation of pulsatile GnRH secretion could involve effects mediated through estrogen receptor and/or AHR as well as AMPA/kainate subtype of glutamate receptors.
Recent observations suggest that levodopa can induce irresistible sleep onset in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Therefore, we assessed sleepiness during a levodopa challenge in 17 MSA compared with 23 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS). SSS scores during the levodopa challenge compared with baseline were significantly increased in the MSA compared with the PD group. These findings suggest greater potential of levodopa to induce sleepiness in MSA compared with PD, which may be related to differences in basal ganglia and brainstem pathology between the two disorders.
Isolated, spontaneous dissection of the coronary arteries in the absence of trauma is an unusual but well-documented occurrence. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in males in the English language literature, and only one case, nonfatal, was associated with cocaine use. We present the second overall and the first fatal case of cocaine-associated spontaneous coronary artery dissection and a brief review of the literature on coronary dissection and the cardiovascular effects of cocaine use. The mechanism of cocaine's toxicity on the heart and vasculature is complex, multifactorial, and predominantly related to cocaine's adrenergic properties. The increased arterial blood pressure from cocaine's inotropic and chronotropic effects combined with its direct vasoconstrictive effect leads to increased shear forces on the coronary endothelium. This elevated stress may be responsible for the formation of an intimal tear and the subsequent dissection of the coronary artery. If the dissected portion of the arterial wall is displaced enough to significantly occlude the true lumen, infarction can result. In light of this possibility, coronary artery dissection must be considered in young patients presenting with symptoms of cardiac ischemia and a history of cocaine use.
We report on a patient who developed acute parkinsonian symptoms following shunt revision for hydrocephalus. Parkinsonism improved dramatically after levodopa therapy. Furthermore, there was no recurrence of Parkinsonism despite discontinuation of levodopa. This observation suggests that Parkinsonism in this patient was caused by reversible dysfunction of the presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway due to hydrocephalus.
Exposure to high levels of many pesticides has both acute and long-term neurologic consequences, but little is known about the neurotoxicity of chronic exposure to moderate pesticide levels. We analysed cross-sectional data from 18 782 Caucasian, male, licensed pesticide applicators, enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study from 1993 to 1997. Applicators provided information on lifetime pesticide use, and 23 neurologic symptoms typically associated with pesticide intoxication. Increased risk of experiencing >/=10 symptoms during the year before enrollment was associated with cumulative pesticide use, personally mixing or applying pesticides, pesticide-related medical care, diagnosed pesticide poisoning, and events involving high personal pesticide exposure. Greatest risk was associated with use of organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides. Results were similar after stratification by pesticide use during the year before enrollment, or exclusion of applicators with a history of pesticide poisoning, or high-exposure events. Use of pesticide application methods likely to involve high personal exposure was associated with greater risk. Groups of symptoms reflecting several neurologic domains, including affect, cognition, autonomic and motor function, and vision, were also associated with pesticide exposure. These results suggest that neurologic symptoms are associated with cumulative exposure to moderate levels of organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides, regardless of recent exposure or history of poisoning.
To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of various predictors of hypotension during onset of spinal anesthesia in elderly patients.
Prospective study.
32 ASA physical status I, II, and III patients, aged >or=60 years, scheduled for elective lower limb surgery with spinal anesthesia.
Patients received spinal anesthesia with 10-17.5 mg of bupivacaine. No prophylactic ephedrine or fluid preloading was used.
A 5-minute baseline was recorded and during onset of spinal anesthesia, hemodynamic changes were measured every 10 seconds from the radial artery pressure curve. Data collection ended when patients were ready for surgery, or if ephedrine was given to increase mean arterial pressure.
21 patients had hypotension. Baseline blood pressure variability low-frequency band power (BPV LF) >8 mmHg(2) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) reduction >or=5% had high sensitivity (0.73 and 0.90, respectively) and specificity (0.78 and 0.64, respectively), and were significantly associated with the development of hypotension.
Only NIRS and BPV LF could significantly predict hypotension among the elderly.
This study compares the antineoplastic potential of a novel treatment strategy combining cell cycle inhibitor-779 (CCI-779) plus dacarbazine (DTIC) versus DTIC monotreatment, the current chemotherapeutic mainstay in combating metastatic melanoma. A controlled four-group parallel study design comprising 24-40 mice per tumor cell line was used in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-mouse xenotransplantation model. SCID mice were injected with 518A2, Mel-JUSO, or 607B human melanoma cells. After they developed tumors, mice received daily CCI-779 or solvent over 14 days. From treatment day 4-8 mice were additionally injected with DTIC or saline. Treatment with CCI-779 plus DTIC was superior to single agent DTIC in two out of three cell lines (P<0.05). The tumor weight reduction was 44+/-17 and 61+/-6% compared with DTIC monotreatment in Mel-JUSO and 607B melanomas, respectively (P<0.05). In contrast, in 518A2 xenotransplants, CCI-779 plus DTIC treatment was as effective as DTIC monotreatment. CCI-779 monotherapy exerted no statistically significant antitumor effect. Collectively, these data indicate that CCI-779 has the potential to increase the chemotherapeutic efficacy, as the combination of CCI-779 plus DTIC proved to be more efficacious compared to DTIC monotherapy in two out of three melanoma cell lines in vivo.
To study the effect of non-ionic contrast medium on renal function in children with cardiovascular disease.
Analysis of renal function in 98 children with cardiovascular disease before and after the use of Iopamidol, Iohexol, and Ioversol was done for angiography. Serum creatinine (s-Cre), urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminase (u-NAG), urinary beta 2-microglobulin (u-BMG), and urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (u-AMG) levels were evaluated.
Although s-Cre levels remained unchanged, u-NAG/Cre, u-AMG/Cre and u-BMG/Cre significantly increased 12 hours after angiography. Levels of u-NAG/Cre, u-BMG/Cre, and u-AMG/Cre after angiography were significantly higher in neonates and infants (age< 12-months, n=32) than in children (age>1-year, n=61), in patients with more than 5 ml/kg of contrast medium (n=25) than in those with less than 5 ml/kg (n=70) and in cyanotic patients (n=13) than in non-cyanotic (n=80) patients.
Transient renal tubular dysfunction occurred in all of these three non-ionic contrast mediums. Although renal tubular function was intact on a long-term basis, one should be careful of contrast medium-induced nephropathy, especially in neonates and infants, in patients receiving more than 5 ml/kg of contrast mediums in total, and in patients with cyanotic heart disease in using non-ionic contrast mediums.
