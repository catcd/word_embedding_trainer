A 6-week open study of the introduction of isradipine treatment was conducted in general practice in Hong Kong. 303 Chinese patients with mild to moderate hypertension entered the study. Side effects were reported in 21% of patients and caused withdrawal from the study in 3 patients. The main side-effects were headache, dizziness, palpitation and flushing and these were not more frequent than reported in other studies with isradipine or with placebo. Supine blood pressure was reduced (P less than 0.01) from 170 +/- 20/102 +/- 6 mmHg to 153 +/- 19/92 +/- 8, 147 +/- 18/88 +/- 7 and 144 +/- 14/87 +/- 6 mmHg at 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively in evaluable patients. Similar reductions occurred in standing blood pressure and there was no evidence of postural hypotension. Normalization and responder rates at 6 weeks were 86% and 69% respectively. Dosage was increased from 2.5 mg b.d. to 5 mg b.d. at 4 weeks in patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg and their further response was greater than those remaining on 2.5 mg b.d.
10 cases of myocardial infarction in females (mean age, 41 years, 4 months) on estrogen/progestin compounds for oral contraception have shown up the determinant role of the associated atherogenic risk factors. All patients had 1 other risk factor. In 6 cases there was hyperlipidemia with a cholesterol of above 2.60 and hypertriglyceridemia in 1 case. A family history of coronary artery disease was present in 5 cases. There was heavy tobacco consumption in 8 of the 10 cases. All of these factors, especially in combination, increase the risk of infarction in a female on estrogen/progestin tablets and constitute a contraindication to their use. 2 of the patients had hypertension, 2 were obese, and 1 was a mild diabetic. There was no warning in 1 case in 2, and early dilatation in 4 of the 10 cases. Coronary arteriography on 5 of 7 patients so examined revealed coronary lesions involving 1 trunk. The histological appearances of the occluded segment of the left coronary trunk in the 27-year-old patient who died were those of an organized occluding thrombus, perhaps having developed over a slight thickening of the intima.
Prolongation of QT time interval may be provoked by a limited number of drugs, especially macrolide antibiotics. We describe a case of QT time interval prolongation induced by clindamycin with subsequent repeated ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation; there is no previous report in the literature of QT time prolongation caused by lincosamides.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of pentoxifylline (Trental) in patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID) according to DSM-III-R criteria. Men and women aged 45 years or older, with a Hachinski Ischemia Scale score > or = 7 and a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 10-25 at entry, and computed tomographic evidence of vascular disease were enrolled. A total of 289 patients were randomised to receive either oral pentoxifylline 400 mg t.i.d. or placebo for 9 months, and efficacy was assessed every 3 months. The primary outcome variable was the difference in scores between the two treatment groups, as measured on the Gottfries, Br√•ne, Steen (GBS) scale. Secondary outcome variables included the scores achieved on the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric (SCAG) scale and MMSE, and a battery of psychological and other tests. The intention-to-treat analysis for patients completing the study (n = 239) showed a statistically significant difference in the total GBS score in favour of pentoxifylline (improvement of 3.5 points, p = 0.028). A significant difference in the total GBS score in favour of pentoxifylline was even almost achieved in the intention-to-treat analysis for all evaluable patients (n = 269, improvement of 2.1 points, p = 0.065). It is concluded that treatment with pentoxifylline is beneficial for patients with MID, the global results of the GBS and SCAG scales being reinforced by significant improvements in those subscales specific for intellectual and cognitive function.
Twenty-three patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis were treated with oral methotrexate (MTX) for more than 10 years. MTX was given as a bolus of 5-15 mg/week; the total cumulative dose ranged from 4,690 mg to 10,230 mg. Liver biopsies were performed on 21 of the patients to assess possible fibrosis and cirrhosis. Grade I histopathologic changes were found in 13 of the 21 biopsy samples, grade II changes were found in 3, and grade IIIA changes (mild fibrosis) were found in 5 specimens. None of the biopsy samples showed cirrhosis. Repeat biopsies were performed on the 5 patients with grade IIIA changes while they were still taking MTX. No progression of the fibrosis was noted. Two of the 5 samples, however, were graded IIIB because of portal and perilobular inflammation. Our findings support the premise that prolonged administration of oral MTX, when given as a weekly bolus at a low dose, does not cause cirrhosis or severe fibrosis in the rheumatoid arthritis patient who does not abuse alcohol.
During the last 10 years, several cases of myocardial infarction associated with anabolic steroid use have been reported. Postulated mechanisms to explain this association have included changes in lipid levels, the fibrinolytic system, and platelet aggregation. Clenbuterol is a beta 2-agonist with anabolic properties that has not been seen previously with myocardial infarction. We report a case of myocardial infarction in an otherwise healthy 26-year-old body-builder who recently used clenbuterol and anabolic steroids. In this case, synergistic effects of the two agents seem likely to have played a role in the infarct. The normal coronary arteriograms before any anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy strongly suggest coronary spasm as the mechanism of the infarct.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of hyperosmolality on the performance of, and the collateral blood flow to, ischemic myocardium. The myocardial response to mannitol, a hyperosmolar agent which remains extracellular, was evaluated in anesthetized dogs. Mannitol was infused into the aortic roots of 31 isovolumic hearts and of 15 dogs on right heart bypass, before and during ischemia. Myocardial ischemia was produced by temporary ligation of either the proximal or mid-left anterior descending coronary artery. Mannitol significantly improved the depressed ventricular function curves which occurred with left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Mannitol also significantly lessened the S-T segment elevation (epicardial electrocardiogram) occurring during myocardial ischemia in the isovolumic hearts and this reduction was associated with significant increases in total coronary blood flow (P < 0.005) and with increased collateral coronary blood flow to the ischemia area (P < 0.005).THUS, INCREASES IN SERUM OSMOLALITY PRODUCED BY MANNITOL RESULT IN THE FOLLOWING BENEFICIAL CHANGES DURING MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA: (a) improved myocardial function, (b) reduced S-T segment elevation, (c) increased total coronary blood flow, and (d) increased collateral coronary blood flow.
Well-designed studies on systemic therapeutic modalities for severe psoriasis in children are rare. Children with severe disease are treated with the support of data extrapolated from that in adult, although management in them differs from adults in several important aspects. Like other systemic modalities, data regarding the use of methotrexate in the treatment of childhood psoriasis is meager. This study aims to analyze the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in severe or disabling childhood psoriasis. The records of all the patients <18 years of age treated with systemic methotrexate at the psoriasis clinic of our institute from January 1993 to December 2006 were retrieved. Information regarding demographic profile, disease characteristics, response to treatment, side effects, etc. was noted from predesigned clinic proforma. Indications of methotrexate use were baseline psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) >10, disease refractory to conventional therapies and disabling psoriasis even though the psoriasis area and severity index was <10. Clinical status of patients was assessed at weekly intervals for the first 2 weeks, fortnightly during next month and then monthly. Response to therapy was graded as good (50-75% decrease in PASI) and excellent (>75% decrease in PASI). Laboratory investigations to detect methotrexate induced toxicity were performed at regular intervals. Of the 29 patients treated with methotrexate, 24 were eligible for the final data analysis. Indication for the institution of methotrexate therapy was severe disease, viz., extensive recalcitrant plaque type psoriasis in 17 patients, erythroderma and generalized pustular psoriasis of von-Zumbusch type in three patients each and severe disabling palmo-plantar involvement along with chronic plaque lesions in one patient. Response to therapy was excellent (>75% decrease in PASI) in all but two patients. The mean time to control the disease, i.e., 50% reduction in PASI was 5.1 weeks. Mean total cumulative dose of methotrexate in the first episode was 215 mg. The duration of remission could be calculated in nine patients only, varying from 1.5 months to 3 years. Side effects were mild, observed in nine children, which included nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Methotrexate is an effective, cheap, easily available, and reasonably safe drug to be used in severe childhood psoriasis under an expert supervision and laboratory monitoring.
2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine (PhIP), a compound found in cooked meat, is a mammary gland carcinogen in female Sprague-Dawley rats. PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinomas were examined for mutations in several genes (exons) known to regulate cell growth and apoptosis, including p53 (4-8), p21(Waf1) (coding region), Apc (14, 15), B-catenin (3), E-cadherin (9,13,15), Bcl-x (coding region), Bax (3), IGFIIR (28), and TGFBIIR (3). DNA from 30 carcinomas was examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, but no mutations were detected in these genes or gene regions. DNA from carcinomas and matching normal tissue were further screened for allelic imbalance by using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach with primers to known microsatellite regions located throughout the rat genome. Of 53 markers examined, 12 revealed allelic imbalance. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was detected at two markers, one on chromosome 4 and one on chromosome 6. Sixty-five percent and 96% of all carcinomas examined (N=23) showed MSI at these loci on chromosomes 4 and 6, respectively, supporting the notion that MSI plays a role in PhIP-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), an indication of a possible tumor suppressor gene, was observed at 10 markers distributed on chromosomes 3, 10, 11, 14, and X. The frequency of LOH at these markers was 75-94%, supporting that the regions of allelic imbalance were largely similar for the PhIP-induced carcinomas examined in this study. When PhIP-induced carcinomas from rats placed on high-fat and low-fat diet were compared, no unique regions of allelic imbalance or statistical differences in the frequency of allelic imbalance were observed. Therefore, the high-fat diet, known to be a promoter of PhIP-induced rat mammary carcinogenesis, did not appear to influence allelic imbalance in the carcinomas. Interestingly, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene-induced mammary carcinomas did not show allelic imbalance at 11 of the 12 loci that showed allelic imbalance in PhIP-induced carcinomas. These findings suggest that distinct chemical carcinogens induce different patterns of allelic imbalance during rat mammary carcinogenesis. Since several of the known genes involved in carcinogenesis did not harbor mutations in PhIP-induced carcinomas, further studies are needed to clarify the critical genes involved in PhIP-induced mammary carcinogenesis and to determine whether regions of LOH harbor potentially novel tumor suppressor genes involved in this disease.
This 6-day study evaluated the efficacy of equivalent doses of loxapine and thiothixene for rapid tranquilization of acutely disturbed, psychotic patients. After initial tranquilization with intramuscular injections for 24 hours, 58 patients were treated for 5 days with oral medication. With both drugs, intramuscular treatment demonstrated clinically significant improvement from baseline on Clinical Global Impressions and Brief Psychiatric Rating scales; this improvement continued during the oral phase. Median time to tranquilization was significantly less with loxapine (60 minutes) than with thiothixene (95 minutes); during the oral phase, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups. Side effects were minimal during the intramuscular phase; dystonia was most common during the oral phase.
To compare the efficacy and side effects of haloperidol and thioridazine in the management of behavioral symptoms of senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type, 16 patients were studied in an open crossover design study. Following 2-week drug washout, patients were alternately assigned to either haloperidol (1, 2, and 5 mg/day for 2 weeks) or thioridazine (25, 50, and 75 mg/day for 2 weeks). After completing the first neuroleptic, patients were washed out and then tried on the second neuroleptic. Six patients completed the crossover design, 1 received only haloperidol, and 9 received only thioridazine. Both drugs were effective in managing target behaviors, which included hostility, uncooperativeness, bothersomeness, emotional lability, and irritability. Complaints of fatigue and extrapyramidal side effects were greater with haloperidol than with thioridazine. Neither compound produced significant impairments in cognition as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination score or caused orthostatic hypertension.
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity.
Although the beneficial effects of dexamethasone have frequently been investigated in various serious-infection settings, insufficient data on valve histology and cardiac function for infective endocarditis are available. The efficacy of moxifloxacin for the treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and the long-term effects of dexamethasone were evaluated in the current study. Sixty-eight rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A consisted of 18 animals and functioned as a control group. Groups B and C consisted of 11 and 23 subjects, respectively, which received moxifloxacin for 5 days in a human-like pharmacokinetic simulation. Group D consisted of 16 animals that were administered moxifloxacin plus dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg of body weight twice a day intravenously). The group B animals were sacrificed a day after the completion of treatment, and group C and D animals were sacrificed after 12 days in order to monitor any possible relapse and allow microbiological, histopathological, and echocardiographic evaluation of the long-term effects of glucocorticoids. No differences in survival, sterilization rates, or inflammatory infiltration and calcification of valve tissue were observed among the treated groups. However, the degrees of valve damage and collagenization were significantly worse, the fibroblast content was higher, and fractional shortening of the left ventricle fluctuated significantly in group C compared to group D (all groups, P < 0.05). We concluded that dexamethasone treatment for experimental S. aureus endocarditis attenuates valve destruction and preserves overall cardiac function without impeding the efficacy of moxifloxacin.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of caffeine (20 mg/L) intake on cadmium (15 mg/L) accumulation in the rat blood, testes, epididymis and prostate as well as cadmium-induced changes to the antioxidant defense system of the epididymis. Caffeine reduced the cadmium concentration in all tissues analyzed. Meanwhile, cadmium reduced catalase activity and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the epididymis. Caffeine increased SOD activity, catalase and glutathione tissue expression and sustains the cadmium's effect on catalase and GSP-Px activity. No differences in the expression of metallothionein and lipid peroxidation were observed among the different treatments in the epididymis. In conclusion, low doses of cadmium alter the antioxidant enzymatic profile of the epididymis, but not induced oxidative lipid damage. Caffeine intake reduces overall cadmium accumulation in the organism and enhances the levels of antioxidant protein expression in the epididymis, thus exerting a protective effect against this metal.
It is reported on a 20-year-old male patient, in whom during the treatment of a streptococcal infection with ampicillin an exanthem and an acute interstitial nephritis with acute renal insufficiency appeared. The temporary connection between the application of the medicament and the occurrence of the clinical symptoms and the sensitization to ampicillin proved by the lymphocyte transformation test speak for an ampicillin-induced interstitial nephritis. The discontinuation of the treatment with ampicillin and the application of prednisolone led to a complete involution of the clinical picture. Since ampicillin is frequently used in the clinic one should take into consideration in the indication that possibly an acute renal insufficiency may appear due to an acute interstitial nephritis.
A 44-year-old woman is described in whom amiodarone, disopyramide, and quinidine, administered alone separately, induced atypical ventricular tachycardia (AVT, torsade de pointes). Following a closed mitral valvotomy, she received quinidine, 1.2 g/day, without interruption for 17 years. Because of a recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the dose of the drug was increased to 1.4 g/day; 24 hours later AVT with syncope developed but responded promptly to atropine. Two years later, 24 hours following an increase in the dose of disopyramide from 300 to 600 mg/day, AVT with syncope occurred; isoproterenol abolished the arrhythmia instantly. Amiodarone was the third drug to induce AVT in this patient; she received 200 mg/day six days per week for six months. The dose was subsequently increased to 200 and 400 mg/day on alternate days, six days per week, and two months later AVT occurred. That time the only effective treatment was ventricular pacing.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication. Five females and 6 males, 21-59 years of age, were examined with a 1.5-T whole-body system using a circular polarized head coil. Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation. In addition, we performed a high-resolution 3D gradient echo, T1-weighted sequences at a 1-mm slice thickness. The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum. Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67.66 and 131.08 ml (mean 108.9 ml). In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age-matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes. Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume. However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters. We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients. Quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cerebellar disorders.
Diuretics are required in the majority of patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). The reduction of pulmonary venous congestion results in rapid improvement of dyspnoea and increased exercise tolerance. In contrast to arterial hypertension, there are only a few studies comparing diuretics with other drugs in CHF. In particular, no reliable data exist on the effect of diuretics on mortality and major cardiac events in CHF. Diuretic agents differ in their mode of action, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties. Loop diuretics are used in acute CHF and in severe chronic CHF, while thiazides, having a longer duration of action, are suitable for long-term therapy of mild CHF in ambulatory patients. Potassium-sparing diuretics are usually prescribed in combination with other preparations to prevent electrolyte disturbances. No randomized prospective large-scale trials have been carried out to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the various types of diuretics. With adequately chosen dosage, the effects of the different loop diuretics appear to be similar in CHF. However, observational data in ambulatory patient populations indicate that loop diuretics with high bioavailability and longer half-life may offer advantages in terms of clinical stability and resource utilization for cardiac decompensation. In patients with severe pulmonary congestion and oedema, combined use of loop diuretics and thiazides may improve the therapeutic response. Spironolactone can also be prescribed to increase diuresis in patients who are resistant to a combination of loop diuretics and ACE inhibitors.
Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common form of epilepsy in adults, often display cognitive deficits. The time course and underlying mechanisms of cognitive decline remain unknown during epileptogenesis (the process leading to epilepsy). Using the rat pilocarpine model of TLE, we performed a longitudinal study to assess spatial and nonspatial cognitive performance during epileptogenesis. In parallel, we monitored interictal-like activity (ILA) in the hippocampal CA1 region, as well as theta oscillations, a brain rhythm central to numerous cognitive processes. Here, we report that spatial memory was altered soon after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, i.e., already during the seizure-free, latent period. Spatial deficits correlated with a decrease in the power of theta oscillations but not with the frequency of ILA. Spatial deficits persisted when animals had spontaneous seizures (chronic stage) without further modification. In contrast, nonspatial memory performances remained unaffected throughout. We conclude that the reorganization of hippocampal circuitry that immediately follows the initial insult can affect theta oscillation mechanisms, in turn, resulting in deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. These deficits may be dissociated from the process that leads to epilepsy itself but could instead constitute, as ILA, early markers in at-risk patients and/or provide beneficial therapeutic targets.
A case of sick sinus syndrome aggravated by carbamazepine prescribed for epilepsy is described. A 70 year old woman with previously stable psychomotor epilepsy experienced syncope of increased frequency after her anticonvulsant was changed to carbamazepine. ECG monitoring confirmed a severe sick sinus syndrome which improved on carbamazepine withdrawal. Failure to distinguish carbamazepine-induced cardiac syncope from epileptic attacks may lead to an increase in dosage and aggravation of syncope.
In a multicenter study the authors prospectively investigated neurocognitive function in childhood ALL patients. Sixty-six patients (mean age at diagnosis 7.9 +/- 3.6 years, 34 female), treated with repeated intrathecal and systemical methotrexate administrations without cranial irradiation, underwent psychometric testing for intelligence, concentration, and visual-motor integration postdiagnosis and after reinduction therapy. Although there was a statistically significant decline of intellectual function after reinduction therapy for younger patients and girls (IQ scores still within normative data range), there were no differences in visual-motor performance and concentration over the time of induction therapy. Thus, neurocognitive examination should focus on younger ALL patients and girls.
To evaluate the hypothesis that intravesical instillation of epinephrine would attenuate bladder hemorrhage in a rat model of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into seven treatment groups: positive control (CYP, 150 mg/kg), negative control (epinephrine, 10 microg/mL), intravesical instillation of normal saline (vehicle) and epinephrine (2.5, 5, and 10 microg/mL), and intraperitoneal administration of mesna (50 mg/kg). Rats were killed on days 1, 2, and 3, and the urinary bladders were removed, weighed, and evaluated by gross and histologic analysis. Vesical vascular permeability was determined by wet bladder weight and Evan's blue dye absorbance.
Cyclophosphamide administration induced severe hemorrhagic cystitis with marked edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation. All three epinephrine-treated groups had marked attenuation of hemorrhagic cystitis compared with the positive and negative control and mesna-treated groups. Epinephrine was also associated with significant inhibition of tissue edema, indicating decreased vesical vascular permeability.
In this rat model of CYP-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, intravesical instillation of epinephrine inhibited edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation.
gamma-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) block NOTCH receptor cleavage and pathway activation and have been under clinical evaluation for the treatment of malignancies such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). The ability of GSIs to decrease T-ALL cell viability in vitro is a slow process requiring >8 days, however, such treatment durations are not well tolerated in vivo. Here we study GSI's effect on tumour and normal cellular processes to optimize dosing regimens for anti-tumour efficacy.
Inhibition of the Notch pathway in mouse intestinal epithelium was used to evaluate the effect of GSIs and guide the design of dosing regimens for xenograft models. Serum Abeta(40) and Notch target gene modulation in tumours were used to evaluate the degree and duration of target inhibition. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlations with biochemical, immunohistochemical and profiling data were used to demonstrate GSI mechanism of action in xenograft tumours.
Three days of >70% Notch pathway inhibition was sufficient to provide an anti-tumour effect and was well tolerated. GSI-induced conversion of mouse epithelial cells to a secretory lineage was time- and dose-dependent. Anti-tumour efficacy was associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that was in part due to Notch-dependent regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis.
Intermittent but potent inhibition of Notch signalling is sufficient for anti-tumour efficacy in these T-ALL models. These findings provide support for the use of GSI in Notch-dependent malignancies and that clinical benefits may be derived from transient but potent inhibition of Notch.
Three cases with the occurrence of asterixis during the administration of L-dopa were reported. Liver and metabolic functions were normal in all the patients. Upon the appearance of asterixis no other involuntary movements probably resulting from an excess administration of L-dopa were observed. Asterixis occurred accompanied by clinical symptoms such as hallucination and a mild clouding of consciousness by insomnia. Because of its reversal with drug withdrawal, asterixis seemed to be L-dopa-related. The biochemical basis of asterixis is not known but may involve the dopaminergic or serotonergic system.
Smooth pursuit eye movements were evaluated in 21 healthy volunteers and 126 patients meeting criteria for one of the following DSM-III-R dependence diagnoses: alcohol (n = 10), cocaine (n = 44), heroin (n = 34), or dual alcohol and cocaine (n = 38). A significant reduction in tracking accuracy was found in the heroin and the dually dependent groups relative to controls. Interestingly, the eye movement dysfunction in the drug-dependent groups was no longer detectable when the effects of antisocial personality disorder were statistically removed. The magnitude of the dysfunction also correlated with several antisocial personality-related features, including an increased number of criminal charges and months of incarceration, increased problems associated with drug abuse, and lower intellectual functioning. The relationship demonstrated presently between antisocial personality disorder and eye movement dysfunction may have implications beyond studies of substance dependence.
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a suspected endocrine disruptor highly prevalent in our environment since it is used as monomer of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Recent epidemiological and animal studies have suggested that BPA exposure may influence the development of obesity and related pathologies such as type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. However, experimental studies have often focused on short-term exposures. In this study, we investigated the effect of several months of BPA exposure on hepatic and plasma metabolic markers in adult mice. Male CD1 mice were exposed during 8 months to five different BPA doses below or equivalent to the current no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL: 5000 Œºg/kg/day) through drinking water. Plasma lipid profiles and liver transcriptomic analysis were performed in control and BPA-treated animals. We report a specific impact of BPA exposure on glycaemia, glucose tolerance and cholesterolemia. Consistent with the hypercholesterolemia in BPA-treated animals, RT-qPCR performed on hepatic mRNA from same animals demonstrated an overexpression of key genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, namely, Mvd, Lss Hmgcr, and Sqle. BPA also induced the expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 2, a master regulator of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. As shown by the plasma lathosterol to cholesterol ratio, a surrogate marker for cholesterol biosynthesis, whole body cholesterol de novo synthesis was also increased in BPA-exposed animals. These original results are consistent with many epidemiological studies reporting on a link between BPA exposure and the onset of cardiovascular diseases.
