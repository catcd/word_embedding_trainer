Pathological brain iron deposition has been implicated as a source of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species in Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson diseases (PD). Iron metabolism is associated with the gene hemochromatosis (HFE Human genome nomenclature committee ID:4886), and mutations in HFE are a cause of the iron mismetabolism disease, hemochromatosis. Several reports have tested the association of HFE variants with neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD with conflicting results.
Genotypes were analysed for the two most common variants of HFE in a series of 130 AD, 55 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 132 PD patients. Additionally, a series of 115 healthy age-matched controls was also screened.
A statistically significant association was found in the PD group when compared to controls, showing that the presence of the C282Y variant allele may confer higher risk for developing the disease.
Taken together these results suggest that the common variants in HFE may be a risk factor for PD, but not for AD in the Portuguese population.
Hepatic fibrogenesis has close relation with hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP). Oxymatrine (OM) is a kind of Chinese herb that is found to have some effects on liver fibrosis. We aimed to determine the effects of OM on hepatic fibrosis and explore the possible mechanism.
Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into four groups; 16 were used to develop hepatic fibrosis by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and treated with or without OM, and 16 were used as controls. The expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in the livers of rats was detected by immunohistochemical assay. Liver pathology was determined by H and E staining and reticulum staining.
In CCl4-injured rats, the normal structure of lobules was destroyed, and pseudolobules were formed. Hyperplasia of fibers was observed surrounding the lobules. While the degree of fibrogenesis in liver tissues was significantly decreased in those rats with OM-treatment compared with those without OM treatment. The pseudolobules were surrounded by strong, multi-layer reticular fibers, which netted into pseudolobules in CCl4-injured rats, however, there was a significant decrease in reticular fibers in OM-treated rats. The expression of TIMP-1 in hepatic cells was weak in control groups, but strong in CCl4-injured groups, however, the expression of TIMP-1 was significantly inhibited by OM (F = 52.93, P<0.05). There was no significant change in the expression of alpha-SMA between CCl4-injured rats with or without OM treatment (F = 8.99, P>0.05).
OM effectively inhibits CCl4-induced fibrogenesis in rat liver tissues, probably by reducing the expression level of TIMP-1.
A patient with a severe bleeding tendency and hypoprothrombinemia (Factor II activity 2%, Factor II antigen 5%) was screened for the presence of alterations in his prothrombin gene. Direct sequencing of PCR fragments derived from the coding and flanking regions of the prothrombin gene, revealed that the patient was homozygous for an A-->G substitution in exon 3. This substitution predicts the replacement of Tyr44 (TAC) by Cys (TGC) in the prothrombin molecule. Both parents were found to be heterozygous for the same mutation. Further family studies revealed complete cosegregation of the mutation with the prothrombin deficiency. Only the five homozygous brothers and sisters of the propositus were clinically affected (severe hemorrhages including epistaxis, soft tissue, muscle and joint bleedings in all, and severe hemorrhages in the two women). The bleeding tendency therefore seems to inherit as an autosomal recessive trait.
To evaluate the tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and virologic and immunologic outcomes of once-daily indinavir, ritonavir, didanosine, and lamivudine in HIV-seropositive individuals.
Open-label 24-week pilot study.
Ten HIV-seropositive subjects who were either antiretroviral-naive or minimally experienced with short-term single-or dual-nucleoside therapy provided informed consent and were enrolled. All subjects received didanosine (400 mg) 30 to 60 minutes before a meal followed by indinavir (1200 mg), ritonavir (400 mg), and lamivudine (300 mg) concurrent with the aforementioned meal.
Safety laboratory tests, including a complete blood cell count and amylase, lipase, liver transaminase, and nonfasting lipid monitoring as well as plasma HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte count, were carried out at monthly intervals. Genotyping was performed at baseline. Pharmacokinetic studies for indinavir and ritonavir were performed at week 8.
Nine of 10 subjects completed 24 weeks of therapy. No subject demonstrated primary protease inhibitor mutations at baseline. Toxicities experienced by subjects were typically mild and consistent with those commonly reported for each of the medications, including two cases of hematuria. By week 24, median nonfasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased by 49% and 108%, respectively. Median baseline plasma HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte count were 29,292 (4.47 log10) copies/ml and 224 cells/mm3, respectively. Eight of 10 subjects had a plasma HIV viral load of <50 copies/ml by week 12. The 2 subjects with a detectable HIV viral load reached <50 copies/ml by week 28. Median CD4+ lymphocyte counts increased by 193 cells/mm3 at week 24. Indinavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations remained above respective inhibitory and effective concentrations (IC95 and EC50) (uncorrected for protein binding) throughout the 24-hour dosing interval for 6 of 10 and 8 of 10 subjects, respectively.
Our pilot study demonstrates excellent virologic suppression despite low minimum protease inhibitor concentrations during a dosing interval in some patients and is supportive of further study.
Trifluorothymidine (TFT) is part of the oral drug formulation TAS-102. Both 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and TFT can inhibit thymidylate synthase and be incorporated into DNA. TFT shows only moderate cross-resistance to 5-FU. Therefore, we examined whether mechanistic differences in cell death could underlie their different modes of action in colorectal cancer cell lines (WiDR, Lovo92 and Colo320). Drug cytotoxicity was determined by SRB- and clonogenic assays, cell death by flow cytometry (PI and annexin V), caspase cleavage by Western blotting and activity assays and in vivo activity in the hollow fiber assay. The IC(50) values of TFT were 1-6 fold lower than for 5-FU, and clonogenic survival was less than 0.9% at 3 muM TFT, while 2-20% of the cells still survived after 20 muM 5-FU. In general, TFT was a more potent inducer of apoptosis than 5-FU, although the contribution of caspases varied between the used cell lines and necrosis-like cell death was detected. Accordingly, both drugs induced caspase (Z-VAD) independent cell death and lysosomal cathepsin B was involved. Activation of autophagy recovery mechanisms was only triggered by 5-FU, but not by TFT as determined by LC3B expression and cleavage. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA in 5-FU exposed cells reduced cell survival. Also, in vivo TFT (as TAS-102) caused more cell death than a 5-FU formulation. We conclude that TFT and 5-FU induce cell death via both caspase-dependent and independent mechanisms. The TFT was more potent than 5-FU, because it induces higher levels of cell death and does not elicit an autophagic survival response in the cancer cell lines. This provides a strong molecular basis for further application of TFT in cancer therapy.
A 61-year-old man without previous medical history was admitted for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Carbamazepine was prescribed on day 72 for dysesthesia occurring at the time of recovery. Subsequently, severe cardiac conduction disturbances (asystole, atrioventricular block) were observed and a permanent pacemaker had to be inserted. The possible relationship between carbamazepine therapy and cardiac side effects is discussed in this condition, as GBS itself is often complicated by cardiac arrhythmias.
Fetal renal structure and function can be altered by medications prescribed to pregnant women. We report a chronic hypertensive pregnant woman treated with losartan before and throughout pregnancy. At 30 weeks the patient was referred to our Fetal Medicine Unit due to absent amniotic fluid with normal uterine artery Doppler and fetal growth. During her hospitalization a new scan was performed showing that both fetal kidneys were enlarged and slightly hyperechogenic and placental and fetal artery Doppler showed signs of hypovolemia or increased resistance to feto-placental blood flow. Ductus venosous was normal. The fetus was delivered after three days by caesarean section at 30+4 weeks of gestation due to abnormal fetal heart rate tracing. Following delivery, the preterm newborn was treated for a transient renal failure characterized by anuria-oliguria and high plasma creatinine levels (from 3.8 mg/dL at day 5 to 0.8 mg/dL at 16 days). At 30 days of age, ultrasound showed kidneys of normal form and size. The adverse effects of Angiotensin II receptor antagonists in fetal nephrogenesis and function are discussed.
The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of ethacrynic acid to mice at a dose of more than 25 micrograms induced repeated tonic-clonic convulsions with subsequent death. Ethacrynic acid was more potent than other loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide. Diazepam and 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid notably reduced both the incidence of convulsion and the lethality seen after ethacrynic acid administration. Both phenobarbital and ketamine suppressed the incidence of convulsions but not the lethality. Without effects on the incidence of convulsions or lethality, dextromethorphan prolonged, while phenytoin or atropine shortened, the time to the onset of convulsion. Neither ethosuximide, carbamazepine, nor muscimol had a significant effect on the responses to ethacrynic acid. The present findings indicate that i.c.v. injected ethacrynic acid shows strong convulsive activity, probably due to impairment of Cl- transport processes, concomitant with enhancement of excitatory amino acid activity in the brain.
Compliance with long-term inhaled therapy in asthma is often poor, but it is likely to be improved with a simplified administration, once daily. The present study was designed to assess whether, in childhood asthma, a single dose of nebulized beclomethasone dipropionate once daily was as effective and safe as the same total daily dose administered twice daily.
Asthmatic children, not treated with inhaled steroids for at least a month preceding the study and using short-acting bronchodilators more than once a week were enrolled in a double-blind, double dummy, randomised, multicentric study. After a two week run-in period on nebulised twice daily 400 mcg beclomethasone dipropionate, patients were randomly assigned to twelve weeks of treatment with 800 mcg nebulised beclomethasone dipropionate daily, either in single dose (o.d. group) or divided into two 400 mcg doses (b.i.d. group).
65 children (mean age 8.6 years, mean FEV1 81% of predicted), were valuable for intention to treat. During the run-in period, a significant improvement in FEV1, FVC, morning and evening PEF values and clinical scores was observed. Children then entered the randomised trial: 32 were included in the o.d. group and 33 in the b.i.d. group. During the twelve week treatment period, the observed improvement in pulmonary function parameters was maintained in both treatment groups. Morning and evening PEF showed a progressive slight increase as well as PEF diurnal variability showed a progressive reduction in the two treatment groups during the whole study period without reaching statistical significance. Moreover, in both treatment groups a similar progressive increase in symptom free nights and days and in the percentage of children achieving total asthma symptoms control was detected. Finally, no significant changes in urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio were observed throughout the study period and between groups.
A daily dose of 800 mcg of beclomethasone, administered for twelve weeks with a nebuliser either once or twice daily provide similar efficacy in maintaining pulmonary function and symptoms of asthmatic children, with a good tolerability profile.
In order to demonstrate the tumor promoting effect of ethinylestradiol (EE) in our uterine carcinogenesis model, rasH2 or ICR mice given an intraperitoneal injection of 120 mg/kg body weight of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) or an intra-uterine injection of 50 mg/kg body weight of ENU, respectively, followed by 2.5 or 0 ppm EE in the diet for 24 weeks in experiment 1 and 6 weeks in experiment 2. In experiment 1, in ICR mice, the incidences of adenocarcinomas in the ENU alone and the ENU+EE groups were 0% and 37.5%, respectively, the difference being statistically significant. The incidences of atypical hyperplasias and endometrial hyperplasias in the ENU+EE group were also significantly higher than those in the ENU alone group. In rasH2 mice, on the other hand, no endometrial proliferative lesions were induced in the uterus of the ENU+EE group, although uterine adenocarcinomas (55.6%), atypical hyperplasias (33.3%), and endometrial hyperplasias (22.2%) were observed in the ENU alone group. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive indices for uterine adenocarcinomas and atypical hyperplasias in ICR mice treated with ENU+EE showed high values, but those in rasH2 mice given ENU alone were comparable to data for intact epithelium. In experiment 2, the immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelium in the ENU+EE group of ICR mice was moderate to marked, but that in the ENU alone group was slight. There was no consistent difference in ER alpha expression in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelium between ENU+EE and ENU alone groups of rasH2 mice. These results suggest that 2.5 ppm EE paradoxically inhibits the uterine carcinogenesis in rasH2 mice initiated with ENU.
Accumulating evidence from in vitro, in vivo, clinical and epidemiological studies shows promising results for the use of statins against many cancers including breast carcinoma. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive properties of statins still remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the involvement of nitric oxide, iron homeostasis and antioxidant defence mechanisms in mediating the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive properties of hydrophobic statins in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453 and BT-549 metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells. Fluvastatin and simvastatin significantly increased cytotoxicity which was reversed with mevalonate. Interestingly, fluvastatin downregulated transferrin receptor (TfR1), with a concomitant depletion of intracellular iron levels in these cells. Statin-induced effects were mimicked by geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI-298) but not farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277). Further, it was observed that TfR1 downregulation is mediated by increased nitric oxide levels via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. NOS inhibitors (asymmetric dimethylarginine and 1400W) counteracted and sepiapterin, a precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin, exacerbated statin-induced depletion of intracellular iron levels. Notably, fluvastatin increased manganese superoxide dismutase (by repressing the transcription factor DNA damage-binding protein 2), catalase and glutathione which, in turn, diminished H2 O2 levels. Fluvastatin-induced downregulation of TfR1, matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9 and inhibition of invasion were reversed in the presence of aminotriazole, a specific inhibitor of catalase. Finally, we conclude that fluvastatin, by altering iron homeostasis, nitric oxide generation and antioxidant defence mechanisms, induces triple negative breast cancer cell death.
Resveratrol (RSV), 3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene, is known to have many beneficial physiological activities. We have synthesized several stilbene analogues and have reported that the hydroxyl group in the 4' position of RSV exhibited strong radical scavenging action. Using stilbene analogs, we investigated the structure of RSV to explain its protective effect against obesity and type 2 diabetes. All six analogs used in this study inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3-Hydroxy-trans stilbene (3(OH)ST), and 3,4'-dihydroxy-trans stilbene (3,4'(OH)2ST) increased glucose uptake and induced adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes independently of insulin. An in vivo study using mice fed high-fat diets indicated that 3(OH)ST was more effective than RSV in improving insulin resistance. In conclusion, RSV and its derivatives, particularly 3(OH)ST, inhibited adipocyte differentiation and enhanced glucose uptake in the myotubes, resulting in a reduction of obesity and an improvement in glucose tolerance in vivo.
Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by fungal of Aspergillus species absorbed in human through contaminate food in gastrointestinal tract. OTA has been demonstrated to be teratogenic in a number of species including mice and potentially human. Mice exposed in uterus to OTA develop craniofacial abnormalities such as exencephaly, microencephaly, microphthalmia and facial clefts. An important role in differentiation of maxillofacial are exerted by the Hox related genes Dlx and Msx. In the present investigation we have confirmed that 2.75 mg/kg body weight OTA, given at gestational day 7.5, induces significant developmental craniofacial anomalies in mice and we have demonstrated the down expression of Dlx5, a member of Dlx gene family, that seems to be responsible of the observed deformities. These results support the hypothesis that Dlx5 is a target for ochratoxin and the inhibition of its function, directly or indirectly, could be at origin of the observed differentiation defects.
Between 1973 and 1982, 110 patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease who had had disease progression while receiving MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) chemotherapy or a relapse after a MOPP-induced complete remission were treated with either ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) (58 patients) or B-CAVe (bleomycin, lomustine, doxorubicin, and vinblastine) (52 patients) chemotherapy in concurrent nonrandomized trials. Responses were seen in 39 of 55 (71%) evaluable ABVD-treated patients--21 (38%) complete and 18 partial responses--and in 34 of 48 (71%) evaluable B-CAVe-treated patients--21 (44%) complete and 13 partial responses. The median duration of the ABVD-induced complete remissions is greater than 25 months compared with 24.3 months for B-CAVe-induced remissions. The 5-year actuarial freedom from progression is 8.5% for evaluable ABVD-treated patients and 25% for B-CAVe-treated patients (p = 0.10). Toxicity in the two treatment groups was similar, with only significant thrombocytopenia (platelet count, less than 50 000/mm3) being more common with B-CAVe. Although most patients with Hodgkin's disease refractory to MOPP treatment will respond to either ABVD or B-CAVe chemotherapy, subsequent long-term disease-free survival is unusual. The need for improved treatment programs for this patient group is evident.
The GNAS gene encodes the alpha-subunit of stimulatory G proteins, which play a crucial role in intracellular signal transduction of peptide and neurotransmitter receptors. In addition to transcript variants that differ in their first exon due to different promoters, there are two long (Gsalpha-L) and two short (Gsalpha-S) splice variants, created by alternative splicing. Heterozygous inactivating maternally inherited mutations of GNAS lead to a phenotype in which Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia.
The GNAS gene of a 10-yr-old girl with brachymetacarpia, mental retardation, normocalcemic pseudohypoparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism was investigated. We found a heterozygous insertion of an adenosine in exon 3 altering codon 85 and leading to a frame shift inducing a stop codon in exon 4. Molecular studies of cDNA from blood RNA demonstrated normal, biallelic expression of Gsalpha-S transcripts, whereas expression of Gsalpha-L transcripts from the maternal allele was reduced. Immunoblot analysis revealed a reduced Gsalpha-L protein level to about 50%, whereas the protein level of Gsalpha-S was unaltered. Furthermore, the Gsalpha protein activity in erythrocyte membranes was diminished to about 75% of normal. Both the reduced activity and the mutation were also found in the mother and the affected younger brother.
This report demonstrates the first evidence for a pathogenic mutation in exon 3 of the GNAS gene. The mutation is associated with a phenotype of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia due to selective deficiency of Gsalpha-L and a partial reduction of Gsalpha activity.
A prospective and follow up study of renal tubular and glomerular function in 11 children receiving ifosfamide treatment was conducted. Each child received between four and 14 courses of ifosfamide, given as a continuous infusion of 3 g/m2 over 24 hours for two or three days. Evidence of renal toxicity was seen in all patients. There was a treatment related rise in urinary tubular markers (N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and alpha 1 microglobulin). Recovery was limited, so that by the fourth course of treatment all values remained abnormal. There was an associated treatment related reduction in plasma phosphate concentration. Urinary albumin also showed a treatment related rise, but with fewer abnormal values. Electrophoresis was used to confirm tubular or glomerular patterns. Glomerular toxicity was less severe and occurred in fewer patients. The follow up study showed persistence of tubular damage in all seven patients examined, and there was evidence of glomerular damage in five of the seven children. Children receiving ifosfamide need to be carefully monitored for renal toxicity both during treatment and at follow up.
The development of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) remains a major problem in the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to assess the effect of the multitargeting molecule BN82451 on LID and to measure striatal mRNA expression of several genes in a rat model of PD. Rats were administered two unilateral injections of 6-OHDA in the striatum. After four weeks, the animals started a chronic daily treatment with increasing doses of L-dopa over a further four-week period. Over the course of L-dopa treatment, the rats developed abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) classified as locomotive, axial, orolingual and forelimb dyskinesia. In animals rendered dyskinetic by L-dopa, administration of BN82451 at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg p.o. attenuated the severity of fully-established AIMs in a dose-related manner. This anti-dyskinetic effect could be achieved with lower doses of BN82451 administered sub chronically vs. acute single treatment. The improvement of AIMs is not due to a reduction in the general motor activity of dyskinetic rats. BN82451 treatment significantly reversed the overexpression of c-Fos, FosB and Arc mRNA associated with the dyskinesiogenic action of L-dopa. A significant correlation between the degree of overexpression of c-Fos, FosB and Arc mRNA and the dyskinesiogenic action of L-dopa was observed. The data demonstrate that BN82451 effectively attenuates LID and the associated molecular alterations in an animal model of PD and may represent a treatment option for managing dyskinesia.
We investigated the effect of local anesthetic agents on the detrusor muscle in rats.
In vitro isometric contraction of rat detrusor strips was measured. We investigated the effects of tetracaine, bupivacaine and lidocaine on baseline spontaneous contractions and contractions induced by various stimuli, including 60 mM. KCl, carbachol and electricalal field stimulation with a pulse duration of 0.8 or 100 milliseconds.
Local anesthetic agents have complex effects on baseline spontaneous contractility that depend on the type of agent used and its concentration. These agents inhibited nerve mediated contraction resulting from electricalal field stimulation with a pulse duration of 0.8 milliseconds in a concentration dependent manner and also inhibited nonnerve mediated detrusor contractions induced by KCl, carbachol or electricalal field stimulation with a pulse duration of 100 milliseconds Higher concentrations of local anesthetic agents were needed to inhibit nonnerve than nerve mediated contractions. In rat detrusor muscle carbachol induced a sustained tonic contraction even after the depletion of internal and external Ca2+ sources, which was also inhibited by local anesthetic agents.
These results show that local anesthetic agents have a wide spectrum of inhibitory effects on the contraction of bladder smooth muscle induced by various stimulants at different concentrations, which may be potentially useful for treating overactive bladder.
Pathological examination in a patient who developed an ischemic cerebrovascular accident while taking an oral contraceptive demonstrated widespread lesions in the right and left carotid regions. Histological examination revealed the presence of an obliterating thromboangiitis in the arterial walls, with subendothelial fibrosis of the intima, arterial thrombosis, and a marked giant cell reaction where the lesions were in contact with the internal elastic layer. Immunological and biological anomalies confirmed the inflammatory nature of the lesion with the presence of anti-ethinyl estradiol antibodies in the serum and circulating blood immune complexes. These biological and histological results suggest the immunological nature of the mechanism of origin of the cerebrovascular accident in this case.
The article presents the case of a 28-year-old patient, on oral contraception for 2 years, who suddenly developed massive right hemiplagia. Pathological observations revealed widespread lesions in the right and left carotid regions, while histological observations revealed the presence of obliterating in the arterial walls, causing arterial thrombosis and giat cell reaction where the lesions were in contact with the internal elastic layer. Antiethinyl estradiol antibodies were found in the serum, together with immune circulating complexes. Such results suggest the immunological nature of the case presented.
Long term exposure to arsenic can increase incidence of human cancers, such as skin, lung, and colon rectum. The mechanism of arsenic induced carcinogenesis is still unclear. It is generally believed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play an important role in this process. In the present study, we investigate the possible linkage between ROS, β-catenin and arsenic induced transformation and tumorigenesis in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, DLD1 cells. Our results show that arsenic was able to activate p47(phox) and p67(phox), two key proteins for activation of NADPH oxidase. Arsenic was also able to generate ROS in DLD1 cells. Arsenic increased β-catenin expression level and its promoter activity. ROS played a major role in arsenic-induced β-catenin activation. Treatment of DLD1 cells by arsenic enhanced both transformation and tumorigenesis of these cells. The tumor volumes of arsenic treated group were much larger than those without arsenic treatment. Addition of either superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase reduced arsenic induced cell transformation and tumor formation. The results indicate that ROS are involved in arsenic induced cell transformation and tumor formation possible through Wnt/β-catenin pathway in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD1 cells.
To test the hypothesis that dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia causes early-systolic asynchrony predominantly in the regional left ventricular wall, color kinesis (CK) images during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) were recorded in 13 patients with coronary artery disease and in 10 patients without, all of whom showed normal wall motion at rest. Based on the visual interpretation of DSE and the angiographic findings, 21 segments in the short-axis images at the papillary muscle level were defined as ischemic, and 60 segments of the patients without coronary artery disease were defined as normal. The incremental fractional segmental area change (IFAC) was calculated at 33-ms intervals from the CK images. At the peak dose, IFACs during the first 33 and 33-67 ms were significantly lower in the ischemic segments than in the normal ones, and IFACs during 133-167, 200-233 and 233-267 ms were significantly higher in the ischemic segments. The ratio (peak/low dose) of the cumulative fractional area change at 100 ms gave the best sensitivity (= specificity) for differentiating the 2 groups (86%). Dobutamine-induced ischemia is characterized by an early-systolic asynchrony rather than a change in overall wall excursion and CK can provide an objective assessment of ischemia developing during DSE.
A 2-week, double-blind clinical trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and cosmetic acceptability of amcinonide cream 0.1 percent and halcinonide cream 0.1 percent in the treatment of 29 patients with eczematous dermatitis. The dermatologic status of each patient was rated by improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, by the investigator's overall evaluation, and by two patient evaluations. Both medications produced statistically significant and equivalent improvement by Week 2. However, amcinonide was significantly favored in the efficacy evaluation of relief from burning pain at Week 2 and in patient acceptability evaluations in regard to the absence of burning, stinging, and itching on application. The role of propylene glycol in the formulation of the halcinonide cream as a contributing cause of irritation is noted.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and PPARγ ligands can attenuate myocardial fibrosis. Osthole, an active constituent isolated from the fruit of Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson, may be a dual PPARα/γ agonist, but there has been no report on its effect on myocardial fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of osthole on myocardial fibrotic formation in mice and its possible mechanisms. A mouse model with myocardial fibrosis was induced by hypodermic injection of isoprenaline while the mice were simultaneously treated with 40 and 80 mg/kg osthole for 40 days. After the addition of osthole, the cardiac weight index and hydroxyproline content in the myocardial tissues were decreased, the degree of collagen accumulation in the heart was improved, and the downregulation of myocardial PPARα/γ mRNA expression induced by isoprenaline was reversed. Moreover, the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and the protein levels of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and TGF-β1 in the myocardial tissues were decreased. These findings suggest that osthole can prevent isoprenaline-induced myocardial fibrosis in mice, and its mechanisms may be related to the reduction of TGF-β1 expression via the activation of PPARα/γ and subsequent inhibition of NF-κB in myocardial tissues.
