Alterations in metabolic pathways are known to characterize cancer. In order to suppress cancer growth, however, multiple proteins involved in these pathways have to be targeted simultaneously. We have developed a screening method to assess the best drug combination for cancer treatment based on targeting several factors implicated in tumor specific metabolism. Following a review of the literature, we identified those enzymes known to be deregulated in cancer and established a list of sixty-two drugs targeting them. These molecules are used routinely in clinical settings for diseases other than cancer. We screened a first library in vitro against four cell lines and then evaluated the most promising binary combinations in vivo against three murine syngeneic cancer models, (LL/2, Lewis lung carcinoma; B16-F10, melanoma; and MBT-2, bladder cancer). The optimum result was obtained using a combination of α-lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate (METABLOC(TM)). In this study, a third agent was added by in vivo evaluation of a large number of combinations. The addition of octreotide strongly reduced tumor development (T/C% value of 30.2 to 34.5%; P < 0.001) in the same models and prolonged animal survival (P < 0.001) as compared to cisplatin. These results were confirmed in a different laboratory setting using a human xenograft model (NCI-H69, small cell lung cancer). None of these three molecules are known to target DNA. The effectiveness of this combination in several animal models, as well as the low toxicity of these inexpensive drugs, emphasizes the necessity of rapidly setting up a clinical trial.
Several previous studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of the adenosine receptor (AdoR) antagonist theophylline in different forms of acute renal failure in laboratory animals and in humans. Therefore, we wanted to test whether theophylline can also improve impaired allograft function following ischemia reperfusion injury in experimental kidney transplantation (KT). Orthotopic transplantation of the left kidney was performed from Fisher 344 into Lewis rats. All transplanted rats received daily cyclosporine (5 mg/kg). The effect of theophylline treatment (10 mg/kg) on graft function was compared with appropriate controls on day 5 after KT by assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (inulin clearance). On day 5, GFR of allografts in control rats was 0.23 +/- 0.05 ml/min/g kidney weight (n = 10) compared with 0.50 +/- 0.09 ml/min/g in rats receiving theophylline (n = 9, p < 0.01), representing a 2-fold increase in GFR. Renal AdoR A(1) mRNA content was significantly increased in both KT groups compared with their respective control groups, whereas mRNA of AdoR A(2a), A(2b), and A(3) were found to be unchanged. Theophylline did not affect significantly interstitial infiltration of the graft by monocytes/macrophages and T-cells. Likewise, serum cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha] and erythropoietin plasma levels were not different among the allograft groups. The present study demonstrates that theophylline remarkably improved early renal allograft function in rats undergoing KT without influencing cytokine serum patterns or tissue inflammation. Since theophylline is a commonly used medication in humans, clinical studies in patients undergoing KT are warranted.
The Wilson protein (ATP7B) is a copper-transporting CPx-type ATPase defective in the copper toxicity disorder Wilson disease. In hepatocytes, ATP7B delivers copper to apo-ceruloplasmin and mediates the excretion of excess copper into bile. These distinct functions require the protein to localize at two different subcellular compartments. At the trans-Golgi network, ATP7B transports copper for incorporation into apo-ceruloplasmin. When intracellular copper levels are increased, ATP7B traffics to post-Golgi vesicles in close proximity to the canalicular membrane to facilitate biliary copper excretion. In the present study, we investigated the role of the six N-terminal MBSs (metal-binding sites) in the trafficking process. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we mutated or deleted various combinations of the MBSs and assessed the effect of these changes on the localization and trafficking of ATP7B. Results show that the MBSs required for trafficking are the same as those previously found essential for the copper transport function. Either MBS 5 or MBS 6 alone was sufficient to support the redistribution of ATP7B to vesicular compartments. The first three N-terminal motifs were not required for copper-dependent intracellular trafficking and could not functionally replace sites 4-6 when placed in the same sequence position. Furthermore, the N-terminal region encompassing MBSs 1-5 (amino acids 64-540) was not essential for trafficking, with only one MBS close to the membrane channel, necessary and sufficient to support trafficking. Our findings were similar to those obtained for the closely related ATP7A protein, suggesting similar mechanisms for trafficking between copper-transporting CPx-type ATPases.
Previous studies have demonstrated that crystalloid coronary perfusion can cause myocardial edema, but the time required for resolution of this edema has not been defined. Accordingly, studies were conducted in 30 rats. Myocardial edema was induced by coronary perfusion with 20 cc/kg of Plegisol (294 mOsm/liter) during aortic occlusion, which produced diastolic arrest. This was followed by whole blood reperfusion, which restored normal contractile function. Duration of reperfusion in minutes was zero (group 0, n = 6), one (group 1, n = 6), five (group 5, n = 6), or fifteen (group 15, n = 6). A control group (n = 6) was studied without edema or reperfusion. Data included heart weight and myocardial water content. Left ventricular pressure-volume curves were measured in groups 1, 5, and 15. Myocardial water content increased significantly from 75.7 +/- 0.5% (SD) in the control group to 79.7 +/- 1.1% (P < 0.05) in group 0 and then decreased significantly to 77.3 +/- 0.7, 75.2 +/- 1.4, and 75.3 +/- 1.6% in groups 1, 5, and 15, respectively. Water content in group 1 was also significantly greater than in groups 5 and 15. Heart weight changes were not statistically significant. Normalized pressure-volume relationships shifted rightward with increasing reperfusion time, but changes were not statistically significant. We conclude that edema induced by crystalloid coronary perfusion of the arrested heart resolves in the beating heart after less than 5 min of blood reperfusion.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) polyradiculopathy is a rare complication of AIDS in which ascending motor weakness, sensory loss and urinary retention are associated with polymorphonuclear pleocytosis and positive CMV polymerase chain reaction in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We describe three patients with this syndrome. One patient's paresis improved after ganciclovir therapy. Another patient deteriorated despite foscarnet treatment, but improved after ganciclovir was added. The third patient died from ascending paralysis despite ganciclovir-foscarnet combination. Reviewing the literature, we conclude that antiviral treatment reduced mortality from 100 to 22%. In patients with ascending paralysis treatment, failure may be caused by viral drug resistance, at least in some patients. Risk factors for treatment failure are preceding monotherapy for other CMV diseases or persistent CSF pleocytosis on serial CSF analysis. We suggest that these patients should therefore be treated with the alternative drug or a ganciclovir-foscarnet combination therapy.
Patients who noticed worsening of their skin disease after using topical corticosteroid preparations were patch tested both with the commercial preparation and the corticosteroid itself. Between 1987 and 1989, 10 cases of contact dermatitis due to topical corticosteroids were detected in this way. The corticosteroids wee amcinonide (2 patients), hydrocortisone butyrate, clobetasol propionate (2), betamethasone valerate (2), prednicarbate and fluocortolone (2). Patch tests with the commercial preparations and the corticosteroids themselves elicited reactions almost identical in time course and severity. Individual sensitivity seems to be more important for test results than test conditions. 9 of the 10 patients underwent further patch testing with a corticosteroid series. In 2 patients, a true cross-reaction between budesonide and hydrocortisone butyrate was found. All 9 patients showed further sensitivities to other corticosteroids. Most of the cross or concomitant reactions could be categorized into recently defined corticosteroid classes. To improve our understanding of corticosteroid sensitization, and to help the patient avoid reactions to other topical corticosteroids, a corticosteroid series should be patch tested in every case of corticosteroid sensitivity.
A case of carcinoma of the bladder developing in a patient who received cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) therapy for carcinoma of the breast is presented. Hemorrhagic cystitis si a well-documented complication of such therapy. Several recent reports of carcinoma of the bladder in patients receiving cyclophosphamide should make physicians aware of this potential association.
To investigate the cardiovascular responses of cardiac transplant recipients to dental local anaesthetic solutions with and without epinephrine (adrenaline).
A clinical study employing 30 patients (20 cardiac transplant recipients and ten healthy) awaiting gingival or minor oral surgery under local anaesthesia receiving either 4.4 ml lidocaine (lignocaine) with 1:80,000 epinephrine or 4.4 ml 3% prilocaine with 0.031 U/ml felypressin.
Cardiac transplant patients experienced a significant tachycardia 10 minutes after injection of the epinephrine-containing solution. No significant change in heart rate was detected after the injection of an epinephrine-free solution. Blood pressure was not affected. Periodontal surgery did not affect the responses to the local anaesthetics in the transplant recipients.
The cardiovascular response to dental local anaesthesia in cardiac transplant recipients is governed by the solution injected.
The in vitro activity of telavancin was tested against 620 gram-positive isolates. For staphylococci, MICs at which 50 and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) were both 0.25 microg/ml, irrespective of methicillin resistance. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml for vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and 1 and 2 microg/ml for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci were inhibited by < or =0.12 microg/ml.
The aetiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease are currently poorly understood, but symptomatic disease is associated with amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss and numerous alterations of neurotransmitter systems in the CNS. Monoamine oxidase type B is known to be increased in Alzheimer diseased brains. The distribution and abundance of catalytic sites for monoamine oxidases A and B in post mortem human brains of 11 Alzheimer disease cases and five age-matched controls were investigated by quantitative enzyme radioautography. Using tritiated monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Ro41-1049 and lazabemide)--as high affinity substrates selective for monoamine oxidases A and B, respectively--it was found that monoamine oxidase B activity increased up to three-fold exclusively in temporal, parietal and frontal cortices of Alzheimer disease cases compared with controls. This increase was restricted to discrete patches (approximately 185 microns in diameter) which occupied approximately 12% of the cortical areas examined. In other brain regions (hippocampal formation > caudate-putamen > cerebellum), patches of [3H]lazabemide-enriched binding were less abundant. [3H]Ro41-1049 binding (i.e. monoamine oxidase A) was unchanged in all tissues of diseased versus control brains. The monoamine oxidase B-enriched patches in all cortical regions correlated, in their distribution and frequency, with glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive clusters of astrocytes. Diffuse and mature beta-amyloid-immunoreactive senile plaques as well as patches of high density binding of [3H]PK-11195--a high-affinity ligand for peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine binding sites in microglia/macrophages--were found throughout Alzheimer diseased cortices. The up-regulation of monoamine oxidase B in plaque-associated astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease--in analogy to its proposed role in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease--might, indirectly, be a potential source of cytotoxic free radicals. Lazabemide, a selective reversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, is currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We conclude that enzyme radioautography with [3H]lazabemide is a reliable high resolution assay for plaque-associated astroglioses in Alzheimer's disease. Its clinical diagnostic utility for positron emission tomography or single photon emission computer tomography studies is being investigated.
Serum and tissue content of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium was determined in controls and desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt treated rats to determine whether electrolyte changes preceded the development of isoproterenol-induced death in ventricular fibrillation. Control Sprague Dawley, male rats, were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with either saline (Group A) or actinomycin D (0.1 mg/kg; Group B) once daily for 4 days. Other rats received 20 mg of DOCA by implantation, drank normal saline and were injected with either saline (Group C) or actinomycin D (Group D) once daily for 4 days. In the first part of the experiment, it was determined that none of 15 rats from Group C died when challenged with isoproterenol (150 micrograms/kg, s.c.) six days later: however, 13 out of 15 rats from Group D died within 29.1 +/- 15.0 minutes (mean +/- S.D.) from isoproterenol injection. Myocardial sodium was elevated (48.8 +/- 3.8 versus 36.3 +/- 1.9) and potassium decreased (60.4 +/- 3.4 versus 70.6 +/- 3.3, meq/kg wet weight, mean +/- S.D.) in rats that had succumbed to isoproterenol. In the second part of the experiment serum and tissues were removed from control and DOCA-saline pretreated rats before they died in ventricular fibrillation, 20 minutes after isoproterenol. DOCA-saline pretreated rats were hypernatremic and hypokalemic and exhibited higher sodium and lower potassium in skeletal muscle than control rats. Isoproterenol elicited hypokalemia in all rats, but it only elevated sodium and decreased potassium content in the myocardium of rats of Group D, that were more prone to die in ventricular fibrillation. It is concluded that myocardial electrolyte changes precede the onset of ventricular fibrillation and may be associated with the development of this dysrhythmia.
A bioassay of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole for possible carcinogenicity was conducted by administering the test chemical in feed to Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex were fed 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole at one of the following doses, either 300 or 600 ppm for rats, and either 50 or 100 ppm for mice. The rats were dosed for 110 weeks, followed by 1 week of observation; the mice were dosed for 104 weeks. Matched controls consisted of 50 untreated rats and 50 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at week 111, all surviving mice at week 104. The mean body weights of the groups of rats and mice fed 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole in the diet were slightly lower than those of the controls throughout most of the period of administration. No other clinical signs related to administration of the chemical were noted. There was a dose-related trend in mortality only in the male rats; however, sufficient numbers of rats were at risk in all groups for development of late-appearing tumors. In male rats, there was a significant dose-related trend (P=0.044) in the incidences of malignant lymphomas, lymphocytic leukemias, or undifferentiated leukemias, although the results of direct comparisons of incidences in each of the dosed groups with those in the controls were not significant. There was also a significant dose-related trend in the incidence of granulocytic leukemia in the male rats (P=0.014) and a significantly increased incidence of this tumor (P=0.023) in the high-dose group (matched controls 2/50, low-dose 4/50, high-dose 9/49). When the incidences of all neoplasms of the hematopoietic system lymphomas and all leukemias) were combined, greater significance was attained for both the dose-related trend (P=0.001) and the direct comparison (P=0.002) of the incidence of the high-dose group with that in the matched controls (controls 13/50, low-dose 9/50, high-dose 28/49). The reliability of the incidence of hematopoietic tumors in the male controls was supported by that for male controls observed in a similar bioassay of another test chemical at the same laboratory (13/50). The incidences of the combined hematopoietic tumors in the dosed female rats were not significant when compared with the incidence in the matched controls. In female rats, there was a significant dose-related trend in the incidence of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary (P=0.016) and a higher incidence (P=0.021) in the high-dose group than in the matched controls (controls 19/45, low-dose 29/47, high-dose 29/44). The incidence of this lesion in dosed male rats was much lower than that in dosed females, and the dose-related trend (P=0.048) was only marginally significant (controls 3/46, low-dose 3/45, high-dose 8/43). The incidences of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary which were observed in control groups of rats used in a similar bioassay of another test chemical at the same laboratory were 13/49 (27%) for the males and 26/50 (52%) for the females. Because of the variability in incidences of the tumor among different control groups, the occurrence of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary in the dosed female rats cannot be clearly associated with the administration of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole. Also in female rats, there was a higher incidence of endometrial stromal polyps of the uterus in the low-dose group (P=0.023) than in the matched controls (controls 2/50, low-dose 9/49, high-dose 3/50). Since, however, only three high-dose animals had this tumor, the occurrence of uterine tumors in the low-dose group cannot be clearly associated with administration of the test chemical. In the mice, no neoplasms were observed at a statistically significant incidence in the dosed groups when compared with the controls. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, the occurrence of tumors of the hematopoietic system, i.e., lymphoma and granulocytic leukemia, in dosed male Fischer 344 rats was associated with administration of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole. 2-Amino-5-nitrothiazole was not carcinogenic in female Fischer 344 rats or in male or female B6C3F1 mice.
Treatment with the novel antifolate drug combination chlorproguanil-dapsone effectively cleared asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections in 246 (93.5%) of 263 children in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania during the course of a 2-week follow-up. Samples from 71 recurrent infections, collected over a 9-week follow-up, showed selection for parasites with the triple mutant Ile(51)-Arg(59)-Asn(108) in dihydrofolate reductase. There was no selection for mutations in dihydropteroate synthetase, the target enzyme of dapsone. Search for complete identity in the highly polymorphic genes coding for merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 in parasite samples collected before and after treatment indicated that the majority of recurrent parasitemias were new infections. These observations on selection in Tanzania and the lack of selection reported from a less endemic area suggest that the active metabolite of chlorproguanil, which has a short half-life in the blood, may persist in the liver, where it exerts selective pressure on growing preerythrocytic stages.
To improve survival of elderly patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), we conducted a phase II study with high-dose methotrexate (MTX) combined with procarbazine and CCNU. To reduce neurotoxicity, whole-brain irradiation was reserved for patients not responding to chemotherapy.
High-dose MTX was applied on days 1, 15, and 30, procarbazine on days 1-10, and CCNU on day 1. Study treatment comprised up to three 45-day cycles. There was no lower limit of Karnofsky performance status (KPS).
Thirty patients with PCNSL (n = 29) or primary ocular lymphoma (n = 1) were included (median age 70 years, range 57-79 years). The median initial KPS was 60% (range 30%-90%). Best documented response in 27 assessable patients were 12 of 27 (44.4%) complete remissions, 7 of 27 (25.9%) partial remissions, and 8 of 27 (29.6%) disease progressions. Two patients died of probable treatment-related causes. With a median follow-up of 78 months (range 34-105), the 5-year overall survival is 33%. Eight of 30 patients (26.7%) are currently alive and well, six without signs of leukoencephalopathy.
The combination of high-dose MTX with procarbazine and CCNU is feasible and effective and results in a low rate of leukoencephalopathy. Comorbidity and toxicity remain of concern when treating PCNSL in elderly patients.
Although the etiology of eosinophilic myocarditis (EM) is not always apparent, several causes are identified, including hypersensitivity to a drug or substance, with the heart as the target organ. However, symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity are not found in all patients. EM can lead to progressive myocardial damage with destruction of the conduction system and refractory heart failure. The present report describes three cases of biopsy-proven EM with different presentations, including acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock and newly diagnosed heart failure. In one patient, hypersensitivity to sumatriptan was suspected to be the underlying cause. All patients responded well to treatment with steroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. There was a complete recovery of the ventricular function in all cases.
A 66-year-old woman developed a bone metastasis from breast cancer to the sternum in September, 1997. She received alendronate therapy, consisting of biweekly intravenous administrations of 10 mg-alendronate 6 times and monthly 20 mg-alendronate infusions 15 times. The first alendronate administration markedly alleviated her bone pain. She obtained complete pain relief after the 4th alendronate infusion. However, an elevation of tumor marker levels in serum without any pain increase forced us to treat her with medroxyprogesterone acetate and doxifluridine in addition to the alendronate therapy. With these therapies, she has shown an objective response (PR) of the bone metastasis for 8 months. In conclusion, alendronate therapy was effective against bone pain due to metastasis of breast cancer.
A leading hypothesis of the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration of the substantia nigra dopamine-containing cells in Parkinson's disease (PD) is excessive oxidative stress. In part, this oxidative stress is the result of the oxidation of dopamine by the action of monoamine oxidases (MAO) A and B to generate hydrogen peroxide and subsequent oxygen free radicals. Because of this hypothesis we have treated patients with early PD, not yet requiring any symptomatic treatment, with tranylcypromine, a drug that inhibits both MAO's. These patients were required to observe a tyramine-restricted diet. Thirty-seven patients on tranylcypromine have been followed by us for up to 33 months. Four patients discontinued the drug because of pending surgery. Of the remaining 33, six had adverse effects that lead to discontinuation of the drug, mainly impotency in men. Another common adverse effect encountered was insomnia, but this problem was not a cause of stopping the drug. Depression lifted in all five patients who had this problem at the time tranylcypromine was initiated. Only two patients have so far required treatment with levodopa or a dopamine agonist, and this need occurred within the first 6 months of treatment. The evaluation of all 37 patients revealed that parkinsonian symptoms improved slightly on introduction of tranylcypromine as measured by the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Hoehn & Yahr Staging Scale, and the Schwab & England Activities of Daily Living Scale. Follow-up evaluations for a minimum of 6 months between the first post-tranylcypromine visit and the most recent visit revealed only slight worsening of parkinsonian signs and symptoms, with a mean interval of almost 1.5 years. A longer period of follow-up is needed to determine how long the severity of PD will remain mild in this group of patients.
The noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease in the elderly can occasionally be difficult. Intravenous dipyridamole-thallium imaging is a potentially useful diagnostic test to determine presence and severity of coronary disease; however, the safety of the procedure has not been determined in an older population. The side effect profile and frequency of severe ischemic responses after 0.56 mg/kg of intravenous dipyridamole were compared in 101 patients greater than or equal to 70 years old and 236 patients less than 70 years old. There were no side effects in 64% and 62% of patients greater than or equal to 70 and less than 70 years old, respectively (p = NS). Among the 337 patients tested, there were no complications of myocardial infarction or death. The most common cardiac side effect was chest pain, which occurred in 21 (21%) of the 101 patients aged greater than or equal to 70 years and in 64 (27%) of the 236 patients less than 70 years (p = NS). Aminophylline was required to reverse cardiac or noncardiac side effects in 15 (15%) and 36 (15%) of the patients greater than or equal to 70 and less than 70 years old, respectively (p = NS). A severe ischemic response occurred in 2% and 2.5% of patients greater than or equal to 70 and less than 70 years old, respectively (p = NS). The sensitivity of intravenous dipyridamole-thallium imaging for obstructive coronary artery disease was 86% (25 of 29) and 83% (68 of 82) in older and younger patients, respectively (p = NS); the specificity was 75% (6 of 8) and 70% (16 of 23), respectively (p = NS). Thus, intravenous dipyridamole-thallium imaging is a safe noninvasive method for assessment of older patients with obstructive coronary disease; its side effect profile and diagnostic accuracy are similar to those seen in younger patients. The technique is associated with severe ischemic responses in only a small minority of patients.
This case report describes postoperative, reversible renal dysfunction and hypertension in a 5-year-old healthy boy after administration of relevant doses of ketorolac during anaesthesia. Two days postoperatively, the boy presented with polyuria, polydipsia, proteinuria, microscopic haematuria, and hypertension. He was treated with nifedipine. After six months the blood pressure and azotaemia parameters had normalised and antihypertensive treatment was discontinued.
Sulfonamide antimicrobials such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) have been associated with drug hypersensitivity reactions, particularly in patients with AIDS. A reactive oxidative metabolite, sulfamethoxazole-nitroso (SMX-NO), forms drug-tissue adducts that elicit a T-cell response. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA) and glutathione (GSH) reduce SMX-NO to the less reactive hydroxylamine metabolite (SMX-HA), which is further reduced to the non-immunogenic parent compound by cytochrome b (5) (b5) and its reductase (b5R). We hypothesized that deficiencies in AA and GSH would enhance drug-tissue adduct formation and immunogenicity toward SMX-NO and that these antioxidant deficiencies might also impair the activity of the b5/b5R pathway. We tested these hypotheses in guinea pigs fed either a normal or AA-restricted diet, followed by buthionine sulfoximine treatment (250 mg/kg SC daily, or vehicle); and SMX-NO (1 mg/kg IP 4 days per week, or vehicle), for 2 weeks. Guinea pigs did not show any biochemical or histopathologic evidence of SMX-NO-related toxicity. Combined AA and GSH deficiency in this model did not significantly increase tissue-drug adduct formation, or splenocyte proliferation in response to SMX-NO. However, combined antioxidant deficiency was associated with decreased mRNA and protein expression of cytochrome b (5), as well as significant decreases in SMX-HA reduction in SMX-NO-treated pigs. These results suggest that SMX-HA detoxification may be down-regulated in combined AA and GSH deficiency. This mechanism could contribute to the higher risk of SMX hypersensitivity in patients with AIDS with antioxidant depletion.
During lung development, the extracellular matrix undergoes dynamic remodeling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), are important enzymes that participate in regulating tissue remodeling. There is an abnormal balance of the synthesis and degradation of collagen and elastin in perinatal lung associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). This study was designed to (1) determine the expression and gelatinolytic activity patterns of MMPs 2 and 9 and TIMPs 1 and 2 in rat lungs during the perinatal period, and (2) to test the hypothesis that they are abnormal in nitrofen-induced CDH. Measurements were made using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and zymography. The mRNA expression and activity of MMP 2 did not change significantly from embryonic day 16 to postnatal day 14. The most striking feature found was the rapid increase in the expression of MMP 9 soon after birth. Measurements were repeated on lung tissue isolated from embryonic rats with nitrofen-induced CDH. The expression and activity of MMPs and TIMPs were similar to control values and thus we conclude that these proteins appear not to be responsible for the altered extracellular matrix and morphological abnormalities noted in CDH lungs at birth.
Albino rats were fed norethindrone acetate in the diet for 2 yr at dosage levels (0.3--0.4 mg/kg) of about 10 and 100 times the recommended human dose as used in a combination estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptive. The treated rats had dose-related growth retardation and alopecia, but an enhanced survival rate. Dose-related changes in the male rats included testicular and accessory gonadal atrophy, and in the females, uterine changes. In animals of both sexes at the high dose level, there was liver enlargement with increased foci of cell alterations and cystic mastopathy. Females had increased adrenal gland weights, decreased ovarian weights, and ovarian atrophy. Females at both dose levels had an increased incidence of uterine polyps, and rats of either sex in the high-dose group had an increased incidence of liver neoplastic nodules. However, there were no significant differences with respect to tumor incidence, probability of tumor development, or number of tumors developing in treated compared to untreated rats. In fact, in the females there was a delayed onset of tumor formation.
Spontaneous hemorrhage in the kidney, also known as Wunderlich Syndrome, is a rare clinical problem. The most common cause of spontaneous renal hemorrhage is tumor. Other causes are rupture of a renal cyst, vasculitis, hydronephrosis, preeclampsia, and kidney infections.
A 67-year-old man was admitted complaining left flank colic pain. A contrast CT scan showed the presence of a subcapsular hematoma of the left kidney extending from the upper to the lower pole. He had no history of trauma and immunological screening tests for vasculitis were normal. His current therapy included acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/daily) and lisinopril (20 mg/ daily). The patient was hospitalized for 4 days and his circulatory state remained stable. Nine months later an ultrasound examination showed complete resolution of the hematoma. One year later the patient was admitted again because of a spontaneous right calf hematoma and a thoroughly investigation of his coagulation pattern was carried out. Laboratory finding revealed a platelet defect, as the number of adenine nucleotides and other marker related to platelet activation were increased: ADP 1 mcM lack 2 masculine wave, ADP 2 mcM lack 2 masculine wave, Adrenalina 5 mcM lack 2 masculine wave, Adrenalina 10 mcM lack 2 masculine wave. Platelet activation markers: Gp53 in lysosomal membrane 0.48 Dpar (0 - 0.26).
Our case describes the recurrence of spontaneous hemorrhages (perirenal and intramuscular hematoma) as a result of an underlying platelet aggregation defect worsened by administration of acetylsalicylic acid. In patients on antiplatelet treatment with a history of excessive bleeding a thorough investigation of coagulation status appears beneficial.
Cholinergic agents reduce allodynia after nerve injury in animals and may be useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Intrathecally administered neostigmine and neuronal nicotinic agonists are more potent in female than in male rats against acute thermal noxious stimuli. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is also a sex difference in the antiallodynic effects of intrathecal cholinomimetic agents in two models of allodynia and to test their pharmacologic mechanisms.
Male and female rats with indwelling intrathecal catheters received injections of neostigmine, bethanechol (muscarinic agonist), RJR-2403 (neuronal nicotinic agonist) alone or with atropine (muscarinic antagonist), mecamylamine (nicotinic antagonist), phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic antagonist), or saline control. The effect of these agents was determined on mechanical allodynia produced by either intraplantar injection of capsaicin or ligation of spinal nerves.
Neostigmine and RJR-2403 but not bethanechol were more potent in female than in male rats in reducing allodynia after nerve injury, and antagonist studies were also consistent with a nicotinic component to explain this sex difference. Phentolamine did not reverse neostigmine's effect. In contrast, for capsaicin-induced allodynia, neostigmine plus mecamylamine but not neostigmine or RJR-2403 was more potent in female than in male rats.
These data demonstrate a sex difference of intrathecal neostigmine after nerve injury-induced allodynia similar to that observed in normal animals that received acute noxious thermal stimulation. However, this sex difference is not universal to all pain models because it was not present after intradermal capsaicin injection, nor is its interaction with spinal noradrenergic mechanisms consistent in all models.
