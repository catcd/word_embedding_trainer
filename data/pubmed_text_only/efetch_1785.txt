The effects of a 6-hour infusion with haloperidol on serum prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels was studied in a group of male subjects. Five hours after starting the infusions, a study of the pituitary responses to LH-releasing hormone (LH-RH) was carried out. Control patients received infusions of 0.9% NaCl solution. During the course of haloperidol infusions, significant hyperprolactinemia was found, together with an abolished pituitary response to LH-RH, as compared with responses of control subjects.
Metoclopramide is a benzamide dopamine receptor antagonist and serotonine receptor agonist widely used as an antiemetic and gastric prokinetic drug. In addition, metoclopramide is a weak and reversible inhibitor of cholinesterases. The authors have previously shown that metoclopramide has a cholinesterase protective effect against inhibition by organophosphates (OPs). The putative mode of protective action of metoclopramide is, when administered in excess, competion for the active site of the enzyme with the more potent OP. In the present paper the authors present their results using another benzamide with weak cholinesterase inhibitory properties, tiapride (TIA). The purpose of the study was to quantify in vitro the extent of TIA-conferred protection, using dichlorvos (dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate; DDVP) as an inhibitor. DDVP is a moderately toxic (LD50 in rats in the milligram range), non-neuropathic OP. The substance is responsible for a large number of accidental or suicidal exposures. Red blood cell (RBC) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in whole blood and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities in human plasma were measured photometrically in the presence of different DDVP and TIA concentrations and IC50 was calculated. Determinations were repeated in the presence of increasing TIA concentrations. The IC50 of DDVP increases with the TIA concentration in a linear manner. The protective effect of TIA on cholinesterase could be of practical relevance in the treatment of OP poisoning. The authors conclude that in vivo testing of TIA as an OP protective agent is warranted.
In the first death associated with immune hemolytic anemia due to cefotetan, the patient developed hemolytic anemia and renal failure, dying 12 days after the beginning of 1 week's cefotetan therapy. The patient's serum contained strong antibodies reacting with cefotetan-treated red cells (RBCs) and with uncoated RBCs in the presence of cefotetan; a much weaker, drug-independent antibody was also detected. Three-days before the patient's death, the antibody reacting with cefotetan-coated RBCs rose to a titer of 262,144; the titer of the antibody to uncoated RBCs, in the presence of cefotetan, rose to 2048; the titer of the drug-independent antibody remained at 4.
There is a considerable body of evidence indicating that stimuli associated with drug administration may become conditioned and evoke drug-like effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of morphine-paired stimuli to affect an expression of morphine withdrawal-facilitated aggression. Individually housed aggressive adult mice were subjected to the repeated subcutaneous administration of morphine (twice a day, 8 days, increasing doses 10-80 mg/kg). Morphine treatment cessation facilitated an aggressive behaviour of animals during the second day of withdrawal. Subcutaneous but not intraperitoneal injection of saline attenuated the aggressive behaviour in morphine-withdrawn mice. These results suggest that the site of drug injection may serve as a conditioned stimulus.
Severe acute hemolytic anemia developed in a woman following treatment with multiple antibiotics for possible postpartum uterine infection. On admission, the hemoglobin was 5 g per dL (50 g/L), the reticulocytes were 35 percent (0.350), the direct antiglobulin test was strongly positive for IgG and C3d (mixed fields), and the indirect antiglobulin test was negative. Serologic studies revealed antibody to cefotetan that reacted by both the immune complex and the drug adsorption mechanisms. Before the diagnosis of cefotetan-related immune hemolysis was made, all medications had been discontinued, and the patient received 4 units of red cells and a short course of adrenocorticosteroids. Recovery was prompt and complete.
We report 2 patients showing invasion of aspergillosis into the central nerve system (CNS). Patient 1, an 81-year-old woman, underwent surgery for sphenoidal sinusitis. She developed cerebral infarction with unconsciousness on 12th postoperative day. CSF examination demonstrated pleocytosis with increased protein and aspergillus antigen. She was diagnosed as having invasion of aspergillosis into the CNS, and was treated with voriconazole. Her clinical manifestations and CSF findings markedly improved. However, the effects of voriconazole gradually attenuated and she demonstrated recurrence of the cerebral infarction. After 2 months, she died of systemic aspergillosis and sepsis. Autopsy studies. Severe atherosclerotic changes with calcification were demonstrated in the bilateral carotid and basilar arteries, and many aspergillus were clustered in the vessel walls. Granulomatous inflammatory lesions with aspergillus were also demonstrated in the area surrounding the chiasm. There were no massive infarcts or bleeding in the brain, but multiple small infarcts were present. Patinet 2, a 64-year-old man, showing bilateral visual loss, was receiving treatment with corticosteroids under a diagnosis of optic neuritis. Two weeks later, he developed cerebral infarction. CSF examination showed pleocytosis with increased protein and aspergillus antigen. He was diagnosed as having invasive aspergillosis from the sphenoidal sinusitis into the CNS. He was treated with voriconazole, and unconsciousness and CSF findings improved transiently. However, he developed a recurrence of the brain infarction and pneumonia and finally died 6 months later. Treatment by voriconazole was definitely effective in both patients, but both patients died of recurrent cerebral infarction, possibly due to resistance for voriconazole, or developing multicellular filamentous biofilms. Voriconazole is recommended as the first choice of antifungal agents for aspergillosis. Aspergillus infection is strongly invasive into arterial vessels. It is important to consider the possible occurrence of cerebrovascular disease when treating invasion of aspergillosis into the CNS.
Loss of PTEN, which is common in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), results in activation of the mammalian target of rapapmycin (mTOR), thereby increasing mRNA translation of a number of key proteins required for cell-cycle progression. CCI-779 is an inhibitor of mTOR. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of CCI-779 in patients with recurrent GBM and to further assess the toxicity of the drug.
CCI-779 was administered weekly at a dose of 250 mg intravenously for patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs). Patients not on EIAEDs were initially treated at 250 mg; however, the dose was reduced to 170 mg because of intolerable side effects. Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity, tumor progression, or patient withdrawal. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival.
Forty-three patients were enrolled; 29 were not on EIAEDs. The expected toxicity profile of increased lipids, lymphopenia, and stomatitis was seen. There were no grade IV hematological toxicities and no toxic deaths. One patient was progression free at 6 months. Of the patients assessable for response, there were 2 partial responses and 20 with stabilization of disease. The median time to progression was 9 weeks.
CCI-779 was well tolerated at this dose schedule; however, there was no evidence of efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM. Despite initial disease stabilization in approximately 50% of patients, the durability of response was short. Because of the low toxicity profile, CCI-779 may merit exploration in combination with other modalities.
Toxicant deliveries (by machine smoking) are compiled and associated cancer risks are calculated for 13 carcinogens from 26 brands of conventional cigarettes categorized as "regular" (R), "light" (Lt), or "ultralight" (ULt), and for a reference cigarette. Eight "potentially reduced exposure product" (PREP) cigarettes are also considered. Because agency-to-agency differences exist in the cancer slope factor (CSF) values adopted for some carcinogens, two CSF sets were used in the calculations: set I [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-accepted values plus California EPA-accepted values as needed to fill data gaps] and set II (vice versa). The potential effects of human smoking patterns on cigarette deliveries are considered. Acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, and acrylonitrile are associated with the largest calculated cancer risks for all 26 brands of conventional cigarettes. The calculated risks are proportional to the smoking dose z (pack-years). Using CSF set I and z = 1 pack-year (7,300 cigarettes), the calculated brand-average incremental lifetime cancer risk ILCR(1)(acetaldehyde) values are R, 6 x 10(-5); Lt, 5 x 10(-5); and ULt, 3 x 10(-5) (cf. typical U.S. EPA risk benchmark of 10(-6)). These values are similar, especially given the tendency of smokers to "compensate" when smoking Lt and ULt cigarettes. ILCR(1)(subSigma-lung) is the brand-average per pack-year subtotal risk for the measured human lung carcinogens. Using CSF set I, the ILCR(1)(subSigma-lung) values for R, Lt, and ULt cigarettes account for <or=2% of epidemiologically observed values of the all-smoker population average per pack-year risk of lung cancer from conventional cigarettes. R(PREP) (%) is a science-based estimate of the possible reduction in lung cancer risk provided by a particular PREP as compared with conventional cigarettes. Using CSF set I, all R(PREP) values are <2%. The current inability to account for the observed health risks of smoking based on existing data indicates that current expressed/implied marketing promises of reduced harm from PREPs are unverified: there is little reason to be confident that total removal of the currently measured human lung carcinogens would reduce the incidence of lung cancer among smokers by any noticeable amount.
In order to study a possible modulatory effect of glutamatergic afferents to the nucleus accumbens (NAC) on psychostimulant-induced locomotion, L-glutamic acid diethyl ester (GDEE), a glutamate antagonist, was injected in the NAC of rats acutely treated with cocaine, amphetamine or caffeine. GDEE at the doses of 5, 10, and 20 micrograms/side significantly reduced locomotion induced by cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was also reduced by GDEE, whereas caffeine-induced hyperactivity was not significantly decreased by GDEE. This suggests that glutamatergic afferents to the NAC modulate the effects of psychostimulants and also dopamine function in the mesolimbic system.
Recent functional brain imaging studies with positron emission tomography (PET) suggest a preference of the right hemisphere, especially the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in affective processing of the clinical pain syndromes. We have investigated the central processing of cluster headache (CH) attacks provoked by sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG). In the cerebrum, provoked CH activated the ACC and the temporopolar region of the right hemisphere in addition to other regions. The regions activated in the ACC (Brodmann area (BA) 24 and 32) are involved in affective/cognitive processing of pain and willed attention. Our study discloses the preferential role of the right hemisphere in attributing emotional valence and attention to the suffering of pain. The findings support the theory of a right hemispheric specialisation in the mediation of withdrawal-related negative affect. The divergence of the distributed central processing between provoked cluster headache attack and experimentally induced acute pain indicates different central mechanisms for different types of pain.
The benzodiazepine clonazepam was approved for the treatment of epilepsy in 1976. To study its use in acute mania, the author compared clonazepam with lithium in a crossover trial. Clonazepam proved more effective than lithium in controlling the symptoms of mania and caused fewer manifestations of parkinsonism. Associated side effects included ataxia, drowsiness, and behavioral changes. No treatment-emergent depression was observed. Neither clonazepam nor any other benzodiazepine is recommended in schizoaffective or schizophrenic disorders because of the high risk of dependence in those patients, in contrast to manic-depressives. For the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, lithium is recommended as the initial agent, with L-tryptophan added if concomitant medication is needed. Clonazepam can then be added as the anticonvulsant, if necessary. In the treatment of acute mania, clonazepam is recommended for the first week of treatment, and lithium is added in the beginning of the second week, thus avoiding the use of neuroleptics.
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent commonly used in the treatment of supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This article reviews the results and clinical implications of primary and secondary prevention trials in which amiodarone was used in one of the treatment arms. Key post-myocardial infarction primary prevention trials include the European Myocardial Infarct Amiodarone Trial (EMIAT) and the Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Trial (CAMIAT), both of which demonstrated that amiodarone reduced arrhythmic but not overall mortality. In congestive heart failure patients, amiodarone was studied as a primary prevention strategy in two pivotal trials: Grupo de Estudio de la Sobrevida en la Insuficiencia Cardiac en Argentina (GESICA) and Amiodarone in Patients With Congestive Heart Failure and Asymptomatic Ventricular Arrhythmia (CHF-STAT). Amiodarone was associated with a neutral overall survival and a trend toward improved survival in nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients in CHF/STAT and improved survival in GESICA. In post-myocardial infarction patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and a depressed ejection fraction, the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) demonstrated that implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) statistically improved survival compared to the antiarrhythmic drug arm, most of whose patients were taking amiodarone. In patients with histories of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, the Cardiac Arrest Study in Seattle: Conventional Versus Amiodarone Drug Evaluation (CASCADE) trial demonstrated that empiric amiodarone lowered arrhythmic recurrence rates compared to other drugs guided by serial Holter or electrophysiologic studies. However, arrhythmic death rates were high in both treatment arms of the study. Several secondary prevention trials, including the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators Study (AVID), the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS), and the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH), have demonstrated the superiority of ICD therapy compared to empiric amiodarone in improving overall survival. Based on the above findings, amiodarone is safe to use in post-myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure patients that need antiarrhythmic therapy. Although amiodarone is effective in treating malignant arrhythmias, high-risk patients should be considered for an ICD as frontline therapy.
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of (-)epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on mitochondrial lipids, lipid peroxides, Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, calcium and adenosine triphosphate in isoproterenol (ISO) induced myocardial infarction in male Wistar rats. Rats were pretreated with EGCG (30 mg kg(-1) body weight) orally using an intragastric tube daily for a period of 21 days. After that, ISO (100 mg kg(-1) body weight) was subcutaneously injected to rats at intervals of 24 h for two days. ISO induced rats showed significant increase in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty acids with subsequent decrease in the levels of phospholipids in mitochondrial fraction of the heart. ISO induction also caused significant increase in lipid peroxidation products (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid hydroperoxides) and significant decrease in the activity of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase in mitochondrial fraction of the heart. A significant increase in the levels of calcium and significant decrease in the levels of adenosine triphosphate were observed in ISO-induced mitochondrial heart. Prior treatment with EGCG (30 mg kg(-1)) significantly protected these alterations and maintained normal mitochondrial function. Thus, this study confirmed the protective effect of EGCG on mitochondria in experimentally induced cardiotoxicity in Wistar rats.
Carriers of a germline mutation in the BRCA genes, in particular BRCA2, have an increased risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma when compared with the general population. While the addition of cisplatin to gemcitabine did not produce survival benefit compared to single-agent gemcitabine in prospective trials it is postulated that the addition of DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin to standard gemcitabine chemotherapy should be considered in known BRCA mutation carriers. We report a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising in a 60-year-old carrier of a rare BRCA2 (1153insertionT) germline mutation. The patient received gemcitabine without any response and actually progression of the disease had occurred. Therefore cisplatin was added in combination with gemcitabine. A dramatic complete response to therapy was encountered with no evidence of disease in both CT scans and markers (CA19-9). In conclusion, in patients with known BRCA mutation associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the addition of a DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin should be considered. Physicians should consider BRCA mutation testing when the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is established, especially when the patient belongs to an ethnic group where founder mutations exist, and/or there is strong personal or family history of cancer. This may be applied also to other metastatic tumors diagnosed in BRCA1/2 carriers.
Acyclovir crystals in the urine of a 28-year-old woman are described. The patient received intravenous acyclovir for herpes encephalitis. The crystalluria was accompanied by impairment of the renal tubules as evidenced by increased urinary beta-2-microglobulin excretion. Consecutive series of 60 patients on oral acyclovir and 20 patients on intravenous acyclovir were studied in order to define the frequency of acyclovir crystalluria. None of the patients studied had crystalluria, and none elevated serum creatinine levels. It is suggested that acyclovir crystalluria might be an early sign of acyclovir crystal nephropathy.
Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) exerts cell type-specific and context-dependent effects. Understanding the intrinsic effects of TGF-β on cancer cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a prerequisite for rationalized clinical implementation of TGF-β targeting therapies. Since the tumor microenvironment can affect how cancer cell respond to TGF-β, we employed a novel three-dimensional (3D) culturing system to recapitulate stromal and extracellular matrix interactions. We show here that TGF-β stimulates growth of human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines (PCCs) when embedded in a 3% collagen IV/laminin-rich gelatinous medium (Matrigel™) over a solidified layer of soft agar. Moreover, in this novel 3D model, concomitant treatment with TGF-β1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) enhanced PCC growth to a greater extent than either growth factor alone, and conferred increased chemoresistance to cytotoxic compounds. These cooperative growth-stimulatory effects were blocked by pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β type I receptor with SB431542 or the EGF receptor with erlotinib. Co-incubation with SB431542 and erlotinib enhanced the efficacy of gemcitabine and cisplatin in PCCs and in primary cell cultures established from pancreata of genetically-engineered mouse models of PDAC. These findings suggest that concomitant inhibition of TGF-β and EGF signaling may represent an effective therapeutic strategy in PDAC, and that this 3D culturing system could be utilized to test ex vivo the therapeutic response of pancreatic tumor biopsies from PDAC patients, thereby providing a functional assay to facilitate personalized targeted therapies.
The asymmetrical breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was studied in female rats. Paw preference was assessed by a food reaching test. Adrenaline-induced hypertension was used to destroy the BBB, which was evaluated using triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining of the brain slices just after giving adrenaline for 30 s. In normal rats, the whole brain sections exhibited complete staining with TTC. After adrenaline infusion for 30 s, there were large unstained areas in the left brain in right-pawed animals, and vice versa in left-pawed animals. Similar results were obtained in seizure-induced breakdown of BBB. These results were explained by an asymmetric cerebral blood flow depending upon the paw preference in rats. It was suggested that this new method and the results are consistent with contralateral motor control that may be important in determining the dominant cerebral hemisphere in animals.
This study was undertaken to evaluate whether significant alterations in serum osmolality, [Na+], and [K+] occur after the repeated dosing of mannitol and whether these imbalances increased accordingly with the progress of mannitol application. This study was conducted by performing a retrospective medical record review of brain injury patients who were admitted to the neurological intensive care units of a university hospital located in Incheon, South Korea. Data on intracranial pressure and serum [Na+], [K+], and osmolality levels were collected from the first to the seventh day of mannitol administration. Our results showed that the highest rate of hyperosmolality occurred on the first day of mannitol administration and that subsequently its rate reduced, although it still maintained high (70-77%). Regarding the serum [Na+], hypernatremia was observed in 10% of the subjects on the first day of mannitol administration and in 10-21% throughout the 7-day mannitol administration period. In this study, hyponatremia was observed in 12.2% of our subjects on the first day of mannitol administration and in 9-24% throughout the 7-day period. In addition, no statistical differences were found between changes in the rates of hypernatremia and hyponatremia throughout the 7-day administration period. The most notable finding was the high rates of hypokalemia observed during mannitol administration. Hypokalemia was observed in 22% of subjects on the first day and continuously increased to 52.3%, and this increase was significant. On the other hand, the rate of hyperkalemia was almost negligible. Our findings appear to provide clear evidence of electrolyte imbalances after repeated mannitol administration. Accordingly, careful monitoring of electrolyte status is essential when repeated doses of mannitol are given. We recommend that the practice of administering repeated dose of mannitol for prophylactic purposes be reevaluated.
An 80-year-old woman presented with progressive cognitive decline and with a 6-month history of gait ataxia. Brain MRI depicted enlarged ventricles and periventricular lesions. Clinical improvement after CSF spinal tap test suggested a normal pressure hydrocephalus syndrome. But CSF pleocytosis with activated lymphocytes and plasma cells and intrathecal Borrelia burgdorferi specific antibody production led to the diagnosis of active Lyme neuroborreliosis. Clinical symptoms of NPH resolved after a course of ceftriaxone.
Neurological examination, MMSE, brain MRI, lumbar puncture, spinal tap test.
Dementia due Borrelia burgdorferi infection with chronic meningitis was reversible after treatment with iv.2 g ceftriaxone per day for 4 weeks.
Rare but treatable dementias must be diagnosed promptly to slow down or even reverse cognitive decline.
Aldosterone seems to have deleterious effects on the kidneys. Many animal studies and a few clinical trials have shown that suppression of aldosteroneby aldosterone receptor blockers ameliorates these effects.
In a double-blind crossover study, patients with diabetic nephropathy who were already receiving either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) were given spironolactone or matching placebo with 1 month of washout in between. Blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, serum potassium, and spot urine protein/creatinine were measured at the beginning and end of each study period.
Mean systolic BP on spironolactone went down from 153.64 (+/-25.95) at the beginning to 141.60 (+/-16.54) at the end of study (P = 0.01). Diastolic BP during spironolactone therapy did not change significantly. The urine protein/creatinine increased from 1.24 (+/-1.13) to 1.57 (+/-2.13) on placebo (P = 0.35) and decreased from 1.80 (+/-1.78) to 0.79 (+/-0.99) during spironolactone therapy (P = 0.004). In other words proteinuria increased by 24% during the placebo treatment period but decreased by half (57%) during the active treatment. Serum potassium increased from 4.29 (+/-0.47) to 4.64 (+/-0.55) during spironolactone therapy (P = 0.002), no significant change with placebo. Whereas serum creatinine did not change on placebo, it increased from 1.35 (+/-0.54) to 1.56 (+/-0.62) on spironolactone (P = 0.006). Glomerular filtration rate decreased from 61.91 (+/-23.4) to 53.94 (+/-23.58) on spironolactone (P = 0.0001) but not on placebo.
Addition of a modest dose of spironolactone to a regimen of ACEI or ARB in patients with diabetic proteinuria causes further reduction in proteinuria and also lowers the systolic BP. As with ACEI or ARB, spironolactone modestly reduces the glomerular filtration rate and raises serum potassium.
Many cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia complicated by serious thromboembolism induced by heparin or other heparinoids such as pentosan polysulphate have been reported. This case is of interest for two reasons: first of all, it was induced by pentosan polysulphate and then reactivated by secondary administration of heparin; secondly, it was complicated successively by an infero-apical myocardial infarction with probable spontaneous lysis of a coronary thrombosis because coronary arteriography performed one month later was normal, and then by massive biventricular thrombosis requiring surgical thrombectomy under cardiopulmonary bypass. Tests of platelet aggregation were positive to standard heparin and to several low molecular weight fractions. The outcome was favorable when the responsible substances were withdrawn.
One hundred two premenopausal women with uterine myomas were treated with LA depot. All women experienced adverse effects during GnRH-a treatment. The majority experienced symptoms attributed to a rapid and sustained decrease in circulating estrogen concentrations beginning 2 to 7 weeks after initiation of treatment. A smaller percentage of women experienced transient adverse effects due to the initial surge and subsequent rapid decline of gonadal steroids. The mechanism of other adverse effects (e.g., arthralgias) remains unclear. Only 6% of women terminated LA treatment before 12 weeks because of the severity of adverse effects.
Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) is characterized by moderate to severe asthma that is aggravated by aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Affected patients frequently have chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis due to persistent upper and lower airway inflammation with marked eosinophilia. IL-13 plays a crucial role in the development of allergic asthma by inducing airway eosinophilia and hyper-reactivity and it has been correlated with an increased eosinophil count.
Two promoter polymorphisms of the IL-13 gene (-1510 A>C and -1055C>T) and one coding nonsynonymus Arg110Gln (110G>A) polymorphism were genotyped using primer extension methods in 162 patients with AIA, 301 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), and 430 normal healthy controls (NC).
There was no significant difference in the genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies of the three polymorphisms among the three groups. AIA patients with the AA genotype -1510A>C (P=0.012) and CC genotype -1055C>T (P<0.001) had a significantly higher frequency of rhinosinusitis, as compared to those with the minor alleles of these two single nucleotide polymorphisms. AIA patients with the GG genotype had a higher peripheral eosinophil count (P=0.025) and a higher serum eotaxin-1 level (P=0.044), as compared to patients with the AA genotype IL-13 Arg110Gln (110G>A).
These findings suggest that the IL-13 polymorphisms at -1510A>C and 1055C>T are associated with the development of rhinosinusitis in AIA patients. IL-13 Arg110Gln may be associated with an increased eosinophil count and eotaxin-1 level and could increase eosinophilic inflammation in the upper and lower airways of patients with AIA.
In the present study we evaluated the 3-month follow-up of 14 subjects with phenobarbital-induced shoulder-hand syndrome after discontinuation of their previous pharmacological treatment (group 1: gabapentin 100 mg/day; group 2: acetaminophen 3 g/day for 3 months). The aim of this study was to evaluate pain and joint function in each group after cessation of treatment and to compare the results in the two groups. The result for pain and joint function was better in the seven patients previously treated with gabapentin.
To evaluate the association between tamoxifen treatment and the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, depression, and the levels of dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) in elderly, nursing home residents.
93,031 women, at least 65 years old, whose data were part of the 1993 New York State MDS, and for whom there was documentation of treatment with at least one medication.
New York State long-term care facilities.
Cross-sectional study via secondary analysis of 1,385 matched sets of residents. Each set included one resident who received tamoxifen treatment and up to four residents who did not.
Included age, ethnicity, tamoxifen treatment, hormone replacement therapy, depression, levels of dependence in ADL and in cognitive skills for daily decision-making, and documentation of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
Women receiving tamoxifen were less likely to have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease documented on the MDS (odds ratio: 0.674; 95% confidence interval: 0.551-0.823), were significantly more independent in bed mobility, eating, toileting (in each case P < 0.0001), personal hygiene (P = 0.0155), dressing (P = 0.0015), transferring (P = 0.0006), locomotion (P = 0.0016), and they had better cognitive skills for daily decision-making (P < 0.0001). They were, however, 42% more likely to have a MDS diagnosis of depression (P < 0.0001). All tests of statistical significance are two-sided.
In this population, tamoxifen was associated with a higher level of independence in ADL and decision-making. While the MDS also suggested a relationship of tamoxifen with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, there seemed to be an increased prevalence of depression among treated women. The findings of this cross-sectional study could be evaluated in the randomized clinical trial that has just begun, and that will compare tamoxifen and raloxifene treatments.
