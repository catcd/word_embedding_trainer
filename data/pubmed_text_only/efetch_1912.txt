Glucocorticoids have been reported to aggravate ischemia-induced neuronal damage in both humans and experimental animals. Because an excess release of neurotransmitters is closely related to the outcome of ischemic neuronal damage, we evaluated the effects of dexamethasone on monoaminergic release and histological outcome. Changes in the extracellular concentrations of monoamines and their metabolites in the striatum produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 20 min were measured using a microdialysis high-performance liquid chromatography procedure, and the effects of intracerebroventricular administration of dexamethasone (10 microg) were evaluated in halothane-anesthesized rats. The histological outcome was evaluated by light microscopy 7 days after ischemia. Additionally, the effects of lesioning of the substantia nigra were estimated. The extracellular concentrations of neither dopamine nor serotonin were affected by the administration of dexamethasone in the nonischemic state. The occlusion of the middle cerebral artery produced a marked increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the striatum, the peak value being 240 times that before ischemia. The preischemic administration of dexamethasone enhanced the increase in dopamine level during ischemia, and the peak value in the dexamethasone group was 640% of that in the vehicle group. After 7 days, ischemic neuronal damage in the dexamethasone group was severe compared with that in the vehicle group. In rats receiving the substantia nigra lesion, the ischemic release of dopamine was abolished, and the aggravation of ischemic neuronal damage by dexamethasone was completely alleviated. Changes in the release of monoamines may be a contributing factor in the development of the ischemic neuronal damage induced by glucocorticoids.
A number of novel proline-linked nitrosoureas (1-4) were synthesized and examined for cytotoxicity and influence on DNA and collagen biosynthesis in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of these compounds employing a MTT assay and inhibition of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated that compound 2, the most active of the series, proved to be only slightly less potent than carmustine. It has also been found that carmustine did not inhibit MCF&-7 cells prolidase activity, while compounds 1-4 significantly increased its activity, when used at 50-250 microM concentrations. Proline-linked nitrosoureas (1-4) also had lower ability to inhibit collagen biosynthesis in MCF-7 cells, compared to carmustine. The expression of beta(1)-integrin receptor and phosphorylated MAPK, ERK(1) and ERK(2) was significantly decreased in MCF-7 cells incubated for 24 h with 60 microM of compounds 2 and 4 compared to the control, untreated cells, whereas under the same conditions carmustine did not evoke any changes in expression of all these signaling proteins, as shown by Western immunoblot analysis. These results indicate the proline-linked nitrosoureas (1-4), represent multifunctional inhibitors of breast cancer cell growth and metabolism.
Behavioural changes, muscarinic and dopaminergic receptors density and levels of monoamines were measured in striatum of rats after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Wistar rats at the age of 21 days were treated with pilocarpine (400mg/kg; subcutaneously) whilst the control group was treated with 0.9% saline (s.c.). Both groups were sacrificed 1h following the treatment. SE induced a muscarinic receptor downregulation of 64% in pilocarpine group. This effect was also observed to be 57% in D(1) and 32% in D(2). In the dissociation constant (K(d)) values in muscarinic and D(1) receptor no alterations were verified. On the other hand, the K(d) value for D(2) was observed to increase 41%. High performance liquid chromatography determinations showed 63, 35, 77 and 64% decreases in dopamine, 3-methoxy-phenylacetic acid, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid contents, respectively. The homovanilic acid level was verified to increase 119%. The noradrenaline content was unaltered. A direct evidence of monoamine levels alterations can be verified during seizure activity and receptor density changes appear to occur in an accentuated way in immature brain during the estabilishment of SE induced by pilocarpine.
Acute renal failure is a recognized manifestation of paracetamol toxicity, but comparatively little data is available concerning its onset and duration. The present study sought to characterize the time course of rising serum creatinine concentrations in paracetamol nephrotoxicity. Renal failure was defined by serum creatinine concentration >or=150 micromol/L (1.69 mg/dL) or >or=50% increase from baseline. Serum creatinine concentrations and alanine aminotransferase activity were considered with respect to the interval after paracetamol ingestion. There were 2068 patients with paracetamol overdose between March 2005 and October 2007, and paracetamol nephrotoxicity occurred in 8 (0.4%). All had significant hepatotoxicity, and peak serum alanine aminotransferase activity occurred at 2.5 days (2.2 to 2.9 days) after ingestion. Peak serum creatinine concentrations did not occur until 5.5 days (4.4 to 5.9 days) after ingestion (p = .031 by Wilcoxon test). Serum creatinine concentrations slowly restored to normal, and renal replacement was not required. In this patient series, rising serum creatinine concentrations only became detectable after more than 48 hours after paracetamol ingestion. Therefore, renal failure might easily be missed if patients are discharged home before this. Further work is required to establish the prevalence of paracetamol-induced nephrotoxicity, and its clinical significance.
Various chemicals including phenobarbital (PB) have been shown to act as promoters in hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. The effect of initiation and/or promotion of chemicals can be quantitatively measured by scoring the number and size of enzyme-altered islands (EAI). The effect of promotion is proportional to the period of treatment and is much greater when the promoter is given earlier after initiation. A unique aspect of hepatic promoters is their inhibitory action against carcinogenesis when given simultaneously with a carcinogen, reducing both the initiating and promoting activities of the carcinogen. With the aid of the promoting action of PB, carcinogenic activity of pure initiators is demonstrated. Promoting effect of PB was found at as low a dose as 5 ppm, which corresponds to 20 mg per 50 kg person per day, a dose several times less than the common therapeutic dose. In an attempt to analyze the mechanism of promotion and also to develop a model system for detecting environmental promoters in vitro, hepatic cells obtained from animals during carcinogenic treatment were transferred to a culture system. Cells comprising EAI after a certain critical stage gave rise to proliferative epithelial cell foci. Some hepatic promoters showed a growth enhancing effect on these foci while others did not, suggesting both the existence of direct action by some promoters on initiated cells and the presence of different promoter mechanisms. Chronic treatment with PB selectively induced gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in "spontaneous" hepatomas of C3H mice, suggesting that PB may enhance the expression of altered gene functions of initiated cells.
Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system caused by selective dopamine-generating cell death, and oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be responsible for the onset of Parkinson's disease. While most cases of Parkinson's disease are idiopathic, 5-10% of cases are attributed to genetic factors. DJ-1 was first identified as an activated ras-dependent oncogene and later found to be a causative gene for a familial form of Parkinson's disease, PARK7. We and others found that DJ-1 plays roles in transcriptional regulation and anti-oxidative stress function, and loss of its function is thought to affect the onset of Parkinson's disease. DJ-1 is mainly located in the cytoplasma and nucleus and partially in mitochondria. When mice or mouse cells were treated with bisphenol A, an endocrine disruptor and inducer of reactive oxygen species, DJ-1 was translocated into mitochondria to maintain mitochondrial complex I activity. We also found that DJ-1 directly bound to and was co-localized with NDUFA4 and ND1, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-encoding subunits of mitochondrial complex I, respectively, and that these associations were enhanced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, complex I activity was reduced in two types of DJ-1-knockdown NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells. These findings suggest that DJ-1 is an integral mitochondrial protein and maintains mitochondrial complex I activity to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis.
Women with epilepsy (WWE) tend to have hormonal and metabolic abnormalities, raising concerns about an increased risk of cardiovascular disorders. This study was performed to determine whether epilepsy itself and/or antiepileptic drug (AED) medication cause metabolic abnormalities.
WWE in premenopausal state aged 18 to 45 years old, currently on AED monotherapy for more than six months, were recruited for this study. The subjects checked their oral temperature each morning, and tested serum levels for lipid profiles, insulin, glucose, and leptin. A HOMA-index was used as a marker for insulin resistance.
Of the 54 total patients, 18 women were diagnosed with primary generalized epilepsy (PGE) and the other 36 were diagnosed with localization-related epilepsy (LRE). Among the subjects, 19 women were on carbamazepine (CBZ), 12 on valproate (VPA), 12 on lamotrigine (LTG), and 11 on topiramate (TPM). Body mass index increased and HDL-cholesterol decreased in patients on VPA monotherapy compared with CBZ, LTG, or TPM (p=0.046 and 0.002). Metabolic syndrome was more frequently associated with VPA-treated patients (41.7%) than CBZ (5.3%), LTG (0%), or TPM group (0%) (p=0.005). There were no differences in hormonal and metabolic indices between PGE and LRE groups.
WWE on VPA monotherapy are more obese and more frequently suffer from metabolic syndrome. LTG or TPM may be safer when prescribed to the patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease.
Clozapine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis and tremor; however, use of clozapine has been limited because of potential adverse effects and stringent monitoring criteria.
To evaluate safety and efficacy in a naturalistic setting, we conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients ever treated with clozapine at a movement disorders clinic in Rhode Island.
Clozapine was indicated for psychosis in 39 patients, for tremor in 19, and for both tremor and psychosis in an additional 6 patients. Fifty of 61 patients reported improvement in their symptoms. Clozapine use was interrupted in 26 patients, for various reasons including transition to hospice care (3), worsening of motor symptoms (4), agranulocytosis (1), intolerable adverse effects (9), symptom resolution (2), and other or unknown reasons (7).
Clozapine may be useful in the management of movement disorders and related symptoms so long as adequate supervision and monitoring can be provided.
We conducted a genome-wide association study on 969 bladder cancer cases and 957 controls from Texas. For fast-track validation, we evaluated 60 SNPs in three additional US populations and validated the top SNP in nine European populations. A missense variant (rs2294008) in the PSCA gene showed consistent association with bladder cancer in US and European populations. Combining all subjects (6,667 cases, 39,590 controls), the overall P-value was 2.14 x 10(-10) and the allelic odds ratio was 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.10-1.20). rs2294008 alters the start codon and is predicted to cause truncation of nine amino acids from the N-terminal signal sequence of the primary PSCA translation product. In vitro reporter gene assay showed that the variant allele significantly reduced promoter activity. Resequencing of the PSCA genomic region showed that rs2294008 is the only common missense SNP in PSCA. Our data identify rs2294008 as a new bladder cancer susceptibility locus.
Clozapine has been associated with a 1% incidence of agranulocytosis. The formation of an oxidized intermediate clozapine metabolite has been implicated in direct polymorphonuclear (PMN) toxicity. We utilized two separate systems to analyze the role of oxidized clozapine in inducing apoptosis in treated cells. Human PMN cells incubated with clozapine (0-10 microM) in the presence of 0.1 mM H2O2 demonstrated a progressive decrease of surface CD16 expression along with increased apoptosis. RT-PCR analysis showed decreased CD16 but increased FasL gene expression in clozapine-treated PMN cells. No change in constitutive Fas expression was observed in treated cells. In HL-60 cells induced to differentiate with retinoic acid (RA), a similar increase in FasL expression, but no associated changes in CD16 gene expression, was observed following clozapine treatments. Our results demonstrate increased FasL gene expression in oxidized clozapine-induced apoptotic neutrophils suggesting that apoptosis in granulocytes treated with clozapine involves Fas/FasL interaction that initiates a cascade of events leading to clozapine-induced agranulocytosis.
Autosomal recessive cutis laxa (ARCL) describes a group of syndromal disorders that are often associated with a progeroid appearance, lax and wrinkled skin, osteopenia and mental retardation. Homozygosity mapping in several kindreds with ARCL identified a candidate region on chromosome 17q25. By high-throughput sequencing of the entire candidate region, we detected disease-causing mutations in the gene PYCR1. We found that the gene product, an enzyme involved in proline metabolism, localizes to mitochondria. Altered mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential and increased apoptosis rate upon oxidative stress were evident in fibroblasts from affected individuals. Knockdown of the orthologous genes in Xenopus and zebrafish led to epidermal hypoplasia and blistering that was accompanied by a massive increase of apoptosis. Our findings link mutations in PYCR1 to altered mitochondrial function and progeroid changes in connective tissues.
The efficacy of lidocaine to prevent ventricular fibrillation during the prehospital phase of suspected acute myocardial infarction was assessed 3 hours after administration in a randomized controlled trial. A total of 204 patients examined within 6 hours after onset of symptoms were included, and acute myocardial infarction was later confirmed in 63% of these. Lidocaine, administered as a 100 mg intravenous bolus dose followed by a 300 mg intramuscular injection, failed to prevent ventricular fibrillation, which was observed in 2 (2.1%) of 96 patients in the lidocaine group and in 3 (3.0%) of 101 patients in the placebo group (p = 0.95; odds ratio 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.3). In addition, sudden cardiac collapse with unknown heart rhythm was observed in three patients who received lidocaine (3.1%) compared with none in the placebo group (p = 0.23; odds ratio 7.6, 95% confidence interval 2.8 to 22.1). The results of this small study suggest that lidocaine, even when given in a high dose, is ineffective in preventing ventricular fibrillation when administered before hospitalization for suspected acute myocardial infarction. Prophylactic use of lidocaine in this situation may therefore not be warranted or advisable.
The aim of this study was to determine the impact of crystallized phenol on the outpatient treatment of pilonidal disease.
A retrospective analysis was undertaken of patients seen in the outpatient surgery clinic of the University Hospital, Elazlg, Turkey. Age, gender, body mass index, characteristics of sinuses at initial presentation, and the recovery time of 41 patients were analyzed. The relationship between recovery time and the number of sinus openings, presence of abscess, and status of the sinuses (acute vs. chronic) were noted.
Crystallized phenol was applied a total of 107 times on 41 patients. Seventy percent of the patients had two to three applications. Mean recovery time was 42.7 (+/- standard deviation of 24) days with a range of 13 to 120 days. Recurrences were observed in only two patients at the fifth and eighth months following recovery. The success rate was 95.1 percent. Median follow-up was 24 (range, 6-98) months. The status of sinuses (acute vs. chronic and presence or absence of abscess) and the number of sinus opening had no effect on recovery time (P > 0.005).
Crystallized phenol treatment is a simple and inexpensive method that can be readily applied on an outpatient basis, decreasing both the recurrence rate and lost work time. We suggest that this method be considered the first-line treatment of any type of pilonidal sinus.
A 60-year-old patient with coronary artery disease and antecedent (1976) myocardial infarction developed sinus standstill with nodal bradycardia of 41/min while on antiarrhythmic treatment with lidocain (2 mg/min drip infusion). Severe hypotension (70/50 mm Hg) occurred concomitantly. Withdrawal of lidocain and intravenous injection of 0.5 mg atropine restored sinus rhythm within 4 min, followed by a very sluggish, gradual increase in blood pressure over the next 45 minutes. Fortunately this episode did no harm to the patient. He was allowed to leave hospital 6 days later as there was no evidence of a second myocardial infarction and anginal pain was successfully controlled.
Controversy has surrounded the question about whether high-dose rofecoxib increases or naproxen decreases the risk of serious coronary heart disease. We sought to establish if risk was enhanced with rofecoxib at either high or standard doses compared with remote non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use or celecoxib use, because celecoxib was the most common alternative to rofecoxib.
We used data from Kaiser Permanente in California to assemble a cohort of all patients age 18-84 years treated with a NSAID between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2001, within which we did a nested case-control study. Cases of serious coronary heart disease (acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death) were risk-set matched with four controls for age, sex, and health plan region. Current exposure to cyclo-oxygenase 2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs was compared with remote exposure to any NSAID, and rofecoxib was compared with celecoxib.
During 2302029 person-years of follow-up, 8143 cases of serious coronary heart disease occurred, of which 2210 (27.1%) were fatal. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios versus celecoxib were: for rofecoxib (all doses), 1.59 (95% CI 1.10-2.32, p=0.015); for rofecoxib 25 mg/day or less, 1.47 (0.99-2.17, p=0.054); and for rofecoxib greater than 25 mg/day, 3.58 (1.27-10.11, p=0.016). For naproxen versus remote NSAID use the adjusted odds ratio was 1.14 (1.00-1.30, p=0.05).
Rofecoxib use increases the risk of serious coronary heart disease compared with celecoxib use. Naproxen use does not protect against serious coronary heart disease.
We report a case of sudden onset of vitamin A poisoning. A 20-year-old Japanese woman had been eating pumpkin and only a very limited amount of other foods on a daily basis for 2 years. She was overly concerned about weight reduction. Aurantiasis cutis and abnormal liver function tests were noted by her family doctor in 1995 when she was 18 years old. At that time, she stopped eating pumpkin. However, she secretly continued an excessive intake of other beta-carotene-rich vegetables, liver and laver for about 2 years. Two and one-half years after being seen by her family physician, she experienced sudden onset of low-grade fever, limb edema, cheilitis, dry skin, and headache. These symptoms worsened daily. A liver needle biopsy was performed, and it showed a normal portal tract along with fat-laden Ito cells in the space of Disse. A final diagnosis of vitamin A poisoning and hepatic injury secondary to an eating disorder was made. Her symptoms and serum beta-carotene levels returned to normal with successful adjustment of her diet.
An 84-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for progressive edema and decreased urine output. She had been taking nabumetone for 6 months, but had discontinued the agent 2 weeks before admission due to progressive edema. On admission she had 2-3+ pitting edema. Her serum electrolytes were sodium 122 mEq/L, potassium 5.9 mEq/L, chloride 93 mEq/L, and carbon dioxide 19 mEq/L. A urinalysis was significant for protein 3061 mg/dl, ketones 15 mg/dl, blood 2+, leukocytes 26-50/high-power field, and a protein:creatinine ratio 24.9. The serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations were 2.7 mg/dl and 70 mg/dl, respectively. Throughout hospitalization the patient underwent aggressive diuresis. She developed congestive heart failure, and hemodialysis was initiated. A renal biopsy specimen on hospital day 9 showed tubular damage with minimal glomerular changes consistent with a diagnosis of nonsteroidal agent-induced nephropathy. On day 13, a 24-hour urine collection had a protein excretion of 3151 mg. Although the patient recovered from her renal failure (creatinine clearance 43 ml/min), the nephrotic syndrome persisted (13 g protein/day). The patient developed infectious complications and died on hospital day 32.
A 40-month-old child was sedated with a fentanyl and midazolam infusion for 7 days. After the drugs were discontinued he became unresponsive and globally aphasic, and had marked thrombocytosis. He was hospitalized for 4 weeks, during which time his motor and cognitive status slowly improved, and had almost returned to baseline at time of discharge. Severe neurologic abnormalities have been reported with midazolam and fentanyl, administered separately or together, and seem to be a consequence of a withdrawal syndrome. Of interest, this patient had a reactive thrombocytosis at the time of onset of the withdrawal syndrome, and his decreased platelet count coincided with the return to normal cognitive and motor status. Based on this experience and other reports, we believe midazolam-fentanyl combination should be administered with caution.
The successful treatment of cardiac failure by heart transplantation is severely limited by the shortage of donor organs, and alternative surgical approaches are needed. An experimental approach that holds considerable promise is the skeletal muscle ventricle (SMV), an auxiliary blood pump formed from a pedicled graft of latissimus dorsi muscle and connected to the circulation in a cardiac assist configuration. Adaptive transformation, or conditioning, by electrical stimulation enables the skeletal muscle to perform a significant proportion of cardiac work indefinitely without fatigue.
In 10 dogs, SMVs were constructed from the latissimus dorsi muscle, lined internally with pericardium, and conditioned by electrical stimulation to induce fatigue resistant properties. The SMVs were connected to the descending thoracic aorta via two 12-mm Gore-Tex conduits and the aorta was ligated between the two grafts. The SMV was stimulated to contract during the diastolic phase of alternate cardiac cycles. The animals were monitored at regular intervals.
At initial hemodynamic assessment, SMV contraction augmented mean diastolic blood pressure by 24.6% (from 61 +/- 7 to 76 +/- 9 mm Hg). Presystolic pressure was reduced by 15% (from 60 +/- 8 to 51 +/- 7 mm Hg) after an assisted beat. Four animals died early, 1 from a presumed arrhythmia, and 3 during propranolol-induced hypotension. The other 6 animals survived for 273, 596, 672, 779, 969, 1,081, and 1,510 days. Diastolic augmentation was 27.4% at 1 year (93 +/- 9 vs 73 +/- 6 mm Hg; n = 5), 34.7% at 2 years (85 +/- 6 vs 63 +/- 7 mm Hg; n = 3), 21.2% (89 +/- 10 vs 73 +/- 8 mm Hg; n = 2) at 3 years, and 34.5% (78 vs 58 mm Hg; n = 1) after 4 years in circulation. After 4 years, the isolated SMV was able to maintain a pressure of over 80 mm Hg while ejecting fluid at 20 mL/s. No animal showed evidence of SMV rupture or thromboembolism.
The SMVs in this study provided effective and stable hemodynamic assistance over an extended period of time. There was no evidence that the working pattern imposed on the muscular wall of the SMV compromised its viability. Areas of fibrofatty degeneration were suggestive of early damage that future protocols should seek to minimize.
We have associated behavioral, pharmacological, and quantitative immunohistochemical study in a rat analog of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia to understand whether alterations in dopamine receptor fate in striatal neurons may be involved in mechanisms leading to movement abnormalities. Detailed analysis at the ultrastructural level demonstrates specific alterations of dopamine D(1) receptor (D(1)R) subcellular localization in striatal medium spiny neurons in l-DOPA-treated 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats with abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). This includes exaggerated D(1)R expression at the plasma membrane. However, D(1)R retains ability of internalization, as a challenge with the potent D(1)R agonist SKF-82958 induces a strong decrease of labeling at membrane in animals with AIMs. Since a functional cross talk between D(1)R and D(3)R has been suggested, we hypothesized that their coactivation by dopamine derived from l-DOPA might anchor D(1)R at the membrane. Accordingly, cotreatment with l-DOPA and the D(3)R antagonist ST 198 restores normal level of membrane-bound D(1)R. Together, these results demonstrate that AIMs are related to abnormal D(1)R localization at the membrane and intraneuronal trafficking dysregulation, and suggest that strategies aiming at disrupting the D(1)R-D(3)R cross talk might reduce l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia by reducing D(1)R availability at the membrane.
The case history of a women with jaundice and laboratory evidence of chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis is reported. The patient had taken papaverine for 6 yr for cerebral arterial disease. Jaundice improved after the drug was discontinued but reappeared when papaverine therapy was reintroduced. Antinuclear antibody and smooth muscle antibody were present. Clinical manifestations disappeared and laboratory results again returned to normal upon withdrawal of papaverine. This case suggests that papaverine should be added to the list of drugs known to produce chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis.
We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of pancreatic cancer, a cancer with one of the lowest survival rates worldwide. We genotyped 558,542 SNPs in 1,896 individuals with pancreatic cancer and 1,939 controls drawn from 12 prospective cohorts plus one hospital-based case-control study. We conducted a combined analysis of these groups plus an additional 2,457 affected individuals and 2,654 controls from eight case-control studies, adjusting for study, sex, ancestry and five principal components. We identified an association between a locus on 9q34 and pancreatic cancer marked by the SNP rs505922 (combined P = 5.37 x 10(-8); multiplicative per-allele odds ratio 1.20; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.28). This SNP maps to the first intron of the ABO blood group gene. Our results are consistent with earlier epidemiologic evidence suggesting that people with blood group O may have a lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those with groups A or B.
