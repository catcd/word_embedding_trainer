The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether withdrawal from alprazolam can increase anxiety-like and aggressive behavior during intra species conflict in mice and, if so, whether a partial benzodiazepine agonist Ro 19-8022 is able to reverse these behavioral changes without untoward effects such as sedation. An experimental model consisting of interactions of pairs of singly-housed male mice with non-aggressive group-housed male mice was used. Alprazolam (1 mg/kg) was given orally twice daily for 8 days and once on the 9th day. When withdrawn from alprazolam (3 days after the last dose), mice reduced social investigation and increased the incidence of aggressive behavior in comparison to the pre-withdrawal level. However, the increase of aggression was moderate and occurred only in subjects with low pre-treatment levels of aggression. Ro 19-8022 (10 mg/kg) significantly antagonized the decrease of social behavior and the increase of aggression after alprazolam withdrawal without causing sedation or ataxia.
Ichthyoses comprise a heterogeneous group of genodermatoses characterized by abnormal desquamation over the whole body, for which the genetic causes of several human forms remain unknown. We used a spontaneous dog model in the golden retriever breed, which is affected by a lamellar ichthyosis resembling human autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses (ARCI), to carry out a genome-wide association study. We identified a homozygous insertion-deletion (indel) mutation in PNPLA1 that leads to a premature stop codon in all affected golden retriever dogs. We subsequently found one missense and one nonsense mutation in the catalytic domain of human PNPLA1 in six individuals with ARCI from two families. Further experiments highlighted the importance of PNPLA1 in the formation of the epidermal lipid barrier. This study identifies a new gene involved in human ichthyoses and provides insights into the localization and function of this yet uncharacterized member of the PNPLA protein family.
The purpose of this cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised in situ study was to evaluate the remineralisation of demineralised enamel specimens using a CHX/NaF mouthrinse in comparison with a CHX- and a placebo-mouthrinse.
Twenty-four volunteers received intraoral appliances with mounted demineralised enamel specimens. They rinsed their mouths twice a day (10 ml for 1 minute) with the respective preparation. After 14 days, the in situ mineral gain and fluoride uptake were determined.
Mineral gain was significantly higher after using CHX/F mouthrinse (358.4 +/- 372.1 Vol.% X microm) compared with CHX (95.6+/-192.2 Vol.% X microm) and placebo treatment (80.8 +/- 159.6 Vol.% x microm). Moreover, CHX/F treatment (2751.1+/-1494.9 microg/cm(3)) resulted in a significantly higher fluoride uptake compared with CHX- (83.8+/-94.0 microg/cm(3)) and placebo- (136.6+/-137.3 microg/cm(3)) mouthrinses.
The in situ study approves that using a CHX/F mouthrinse supports the remineralisation of initial carious lesions.
Dipyridamole-atropine echocardiography testing is used extensively for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and it is highly effective in diagnosing "organic" coronary artery disease by inducing myocardial ischemia via three different mechanisms: maximal coronary artery vasodilatation with phoenomena of flow-maldistribution caused by dipyridamole, increase in myocardial oxygen consumption and reduction of the oxygen supply to the myocardium caused by atropine. Moreover, the abrupt withdrawal of the coronary artery vasodilatation caused by aminophylline, which is routinely infused at the end of the test, may trigger coronary artery spasms in patients with variant angina, thus enhancing the diagnostic power of the test. We report two clinical cases of patients with rest angina and angiographically normal coronary arteries, in whom coronary artery spasm was induced by administering aminophylline during the stress test.
To evaluate in a group of postmenopausal women the effects of long-term raloxifene treatment on breast density using a digitized analysis of mammograms and on insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulinlike growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) plasma levels.
Seventy healthy postmenopausal women with normal body weight were enrolled in this study and were divided into two groups based on their bone status, evaluated by dual-energy x-ray at the lumbar spine (L2-4). Fifty women (chronological age 52.4 +/- 4.1 y, menopausal age 42.1 +/- 3.9 y), in whom the L2-4 T score was less than -2.5 SD, were treated with raloxifene HCl 60 mg/day orally for 2 years. The other 20 women (chronological age 53.6 +/- 3.5 y, age at menopause 43.1 +/- 3.6 y), in whom the L2-4 T score ranged between -1 and -2.5 SD, were enrolled as controls. All 70 women received calcium (1 g/d orally) and cholecalciferol (880 UI/d orally) supplementation. Moreover, all women followed a normocaloric and personalized diet. All women had mammography at baseline and after 2 years of therapy. The mammographic images on traditional support (radiography) were acquired by using a film scanner and were then elaborated by means of ad hoc software. Moreover, assessments of IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and SHBG plasma levels were obtained at baseline and after 24 months.
After 24 months of therapy, there was a significant variation in the raloxifene-treated group with respect to baseline in the distribution of gray classes of radiographic images. In particular, an attenuation of graphic trace with a reduction of the areas with the lowest and most elevated gray classes was observed. In the control group, no significant variations of graphic traces were observed. Moreover, raloxifene treatment significantly reduced IGF-1 and increased IGFBP-3 and SHBG plasma levels at 24 months. During follow-up, IGF-1, IGFPB-3, and SHBG levels did not change significantly in the control group.
Long-term treatment with raloxifene in a population of postmenopausal women is able to reduce breast density. Such an effect could perhaps explain the reduction in the incidence of mammary carcinoma observed in the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation study probably due to the direct antiestrogenic activity of raloxifene on mammalian tissue and/or its indirect activity increasing SHBG levels or modifying the IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio.
A 46-year-old female patient with metoclopramide-induced parkinsonism and depression was reported in view of the rarity of the concurrent development of these side effects. A risk of metoclopramide administration is suggested.
A 1968 Indian study compared the effect of Norlutin (17-alpha ethynl 19-nor testosterone) and Provera (6-methyl acetoxyprogesterone) suspensions on the uterine motility of virgin rats and mice to the action of natural progesterone and testosterone. The test animals were spayed and 2 weeks later, the rats were injected with 2 mcg of estradiol benzoate daily for 3 consecutive days. The mice received .2 mcg injections. On day 4 the animals were sacrificed and the uterine horns were suspended in a 40 ml organ bath containing Tyrode solution at 32 degrees centigrade and aerated with 5% carbon dioxide in oxygen. Rat uterine movement was recorded isotonically with a linear frontal writing lever while a heart lever was used for mice. The action of the compounds was also tested on oxytocin-induced spasms. Norlutin suspension (1.25-50 mcg/ml) inhibited both amplitude and tone of uterine contraction within 2-10 minutes and lasted more than 1 hour. The uterus failed to respond to oxytocin during peak Norlutin action. A progesterone concentration of 1.25 mcg also produced uterine relaxation but its effect on contractual tone was insignificant. Graded concentrations of Provera and testosterone suspension failed to effect uterine motility in rats and mice.
The high diagnostic performance of plasma-free metanephrines (metanephrine and normetanephrine) (MN) for pheochromocytoma (PHEO) results from the tumoral expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), the enzyme involved in O-methylation of catecholamines (CAT). Intriguingly, metanephrine, in contrast to epinephrine, is not remarkably secreted during a stress in hypertensive or normotensive subjects, whereas in PHEO patients CAT and MN are both raised to high levels. Because epinephrine and metanephrine are almost exclusively produced by the adrenal medulla, this suggests distinct CAT metabolism in chromaffin cells and pheochromocytes.
The objective of the study was to compare CAT metabolism between adrenal medulla and PHEO tissue regarding related enzyme expression including monoamine oxidases (MAO) and COMT.
A multicenter comparative study was conducted.
The study included 21 patients with a histologically confirmed PHEO and eight adrenal glands as control.
CAT, dihydroxyphenol-glycol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and MN were measured in adrenal medulla and PHEO tissue. Western blot, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence studies for MAOA, MAOB, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, L-amino acid decarboxylase, and COMT were applied on tissue homogenates and cell preparations.
At both the protein and mRNA levels, MAOA and COMT are detected less often in PHEO compared with adrenal medulla, conversely to tyrosine hydroxylase, L-amino acid decarboxylase, and dopamine β-hydroxylase, much more expressed in tumor tissue. MAOB protein is detected less often in tumor but not differently expressed at the mRNA level. Dihydroxyphenol-glycol is virtually absent from tumor, whereas MN, produced by COMT, rises to 4.6-fold compared with adrenal medulla tissue. MAOA down-regulation was observed in 100% of tumors studied, irrespectively of genetic alteration identified; on the other hand, MAOA was strongly expressed in all adrenal medulla collected independently of age, gender, or late sympathetic activation of the deceased donor.
High concentrations of MN in tumor do not only arise from CAT overproduction but also from low MAOA expression, resulting in higher substrate availability for COMT.
Lung cancer is currently a leading cause of death all over the world. Environmental risk factors, particularly genotoxic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), are likely to account for a much higher mortality. Xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes are potentially chief determinants in both the susceptibility to the mutagenic effects of chemical carcinogens and in the response of tumors to chemotherapy. The well-known carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) of PAH family was given orally (50 mg/kg body weight) to induce lung cancer in Swiss albino mice. B(a)P induction altered the levels of cytochromes (P450, b5), activities of phase I biotransformation enzymes (NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and epoxide hydrolase), phase II enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, UDP-glucuronyl transferase and DT-diaphorase), and the levels of serum tumor markers. Treatment with capsaicin (CAP) (10 mg/kg body weight) to the lung carcinoma mice restored back the activities of phase I and II biotransformation enzymes and the levels of tumor markers to near normalcy. The above findings were substantiated by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) in the lung tissues. Our present study unravels that CAP can effectively detoxify the carcinogens which discloses its anti-carcinogenic effect during experimental lung cancer.
The role of D(3) receptors in the antiparkinsonian actions of l-DOPA and l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) remains unclear. The D(3) receptor partial agonist BP897 attenuates LID in primates without affecting the antiparkinsonian actions of l-DOPA, suggesting that "normalization" of D(3) activity is antidyskinetic [Bezard, E., Ferry, S., Mach, U., Stark, H., Leriche, L., Boraud, T., Gross, C., and Sokoloff, P., 2003. Attenuation of levodopa-induced dyskinesia by normalizing dopamine D(3) receptor function. Nat. Med. 9, 762-767]. However, subsequent studies have questioned these findings [Hsu, A., Togasaki, D.M., Bezard, E., Sokoloff, P., Langston, J.W., Di Monte, D.A., and Quik, M., 2004. Effect of the D(3) dopamine receptor partial agonist BP897 [N-[4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl)butyl]-2-naphthamide] on l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-induced dyskinesias and parkinsonism in squirrel monkeys. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 311, 770-777]. The D(3) receptor antagonist S33084 is not antidyskinetic yet enhances the antiparkinsonian actions of l-DOPA, suggesting that stimulation of D(3) receptors is not involved in LID. Here, we address the possibility that in vivo BP897 acts via mechanisms in addition to attenuation of D(3) signaling. l-DOPA (125 mg/kg) elicits hyperkinesia in reserpine-treated rats, the vertical component of which (rearing) is attenuated by agents with antidyskinetic actions in MPTP-lesioned primates and Parkinson's disease (PD) [Johnston, T.H., Lee, J., Gomez-Ramirez, J., Fox, S.H., and Brotchie, J.M., 2005. A simple rodent assay for the in vivo identification of agents with potential to reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. Exp. Neurol. 191, 243-250]. BP897 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3 mg/kg) reduced l-DOPA-induced rearing by 0%, 44%, 86% and 57% respectively. In contrast, S33084 had no effect on l-DOPA-induced rearing (0.1 mg/kg, 115%; 0.3 mg/kg, 94%, 1 mg/kg, 134%; 3 mg/kg, 100%, of vehicle, all P > 0.05). Furthermore, S33084 failed to antagonize the effects of BP897 on l-DOPA-induced rearing. The influence of BP897 on l-DOPA-induced rearing was, however, mimicked by the selective D(2) antagonist L741,626. Finally, BP897 attenuated l-DOPA-induced horizontal activity, an action attenuated by S33084 and mimicked by L741,626. Thus, while BP897 may reduce LID, we raise the possibility that receptors other than D(3) receptors might be involved in this action.
The effects of selenium, an essential nutrient with anti-carcinogenic properties, are mediated by selenium-binding proteins. The protein expression status of human selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1) in human tumours and the exact function of this protein are not known. In this study, quantitative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) was used on 93 lung adenocarcinomas and ten uninvolved lung samples. Two likely isoforms of a 56 kD protein that showed a significantly decreased abundance in lung adenocarcinomas were observed. Tandem mass spectrometry and 2-D western blot analysis identified these two proteins as human SBP1. Tumour tissue microarrays were utilized to examine the cellular expression patterns of SBP1 using immunohistochemistry. The same tissue samples were examined for SBP1 mRNA expression using oligonucleotide microarrays. Two major SBP1 isoforms were detected, with an acidic isoform (457) being significantly down-regulated in lung adenocarcinomas compared with normal lung (p = 0.02). Two additional more acidic SBP1 isoforms were only observed in normal lung. SBP1 protein isoforms and SBP1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in poorly differentiated (versus moderately and well-differentiated), T2-T4 (versus T1), and bronchus-derived (versus bronchioloalveolar) tumours. Low levels of SBP1 protein (native form, 460) correlated significantly with poor survival (p = 0.007). The lack of SBP1 expression was not due to gene deletion. Treatment of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells with the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine did not affect expression of the SBP1 protein. Analysis of the tumour proliferation status using Ki-67 suggests that down-regulated expression of SBP1 may reflect increased cell proliferation and decreased differentiation in lung adenocarcinomas.
Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a clinically heterogeneous developmental anomaly affecting the CNS and face, in which the embryonic forebrain fails to divide into distinct halves. Numerous genetic loci and environmental factors are implicated in HPE, but mutation in the sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene is an established cause in both humans and mice. As growth arrest-specific 1 (Gas1) encodes a membrane glycoprotein previously identified as a Shh antagonist in the somite, we analyzed the craniofacial phenotype of mice harboring a targeted Gas1 deletion. Gas1(-/-) mice exhibited microform HPE, including midfacial hypoplasia, premaxillary incisor fusion, and cleft palate, in addition to severe ear defects; however, gross integrity of the forebrain remained intact. These defects were associated with partial loss of Shh signaling in cells at a distance from the source of transcription, suggesting that Gas1 can potentiate hedgehog signaling in the early face. Loss of a single Shh allele in a Gas1(-/-) background significantly exacerbated the midline craniofacial phenotype, providing genetic evidence that Shh and Gas1 interact. As human GAS1 maps to chromosome 9q21.3-q22, a region previously associated with nonsyndromic cleft palate and congenital deafness, our results establish GAS1 as a potential locus for several human craniofacial malformations.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most effective anti-cancer drugs in oncology, but may cause a cumulative dose-dependent cardiomyopathy in a number of cancer patients. The effect of DOX on the heart was studied in mice treated with i.v. injections of 2 mg/kg by measuring morphometric parameters, including nuclear index (number of non-myocytes/number of myocyte nuclei), reticulin index (reticulin area/number of myocyte transsections), nuclear transsectional area, myocyte transsectional area, capillary index (number of capillaries/number of myocyte transsections) and capillary transsectional area. The highest significant difference between control mice and DOX-treated mice was observed immediately after the 12th dose of DOX except for the two capillary parameters. The highest level of significance for these two parameters was obtained 12 weeks after the end of DOX treatment. In contrast to the observations in rats, mice did not develop a nephrotic syndrome during treatment with DOX. The morphometric analysis of myocardial changes in mice, as a quantitative and objective method, seems to be a good model for comparative studies on cardiomyopathy induced by anthracycline analogues.
To identify the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the first-in-class, oral CDK4/6 inhibitor PD 0332991 administered once daily for 21 of 28 days (3/1 schedule) in patients with retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-positive advanced solid tumors and to describe pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships relative to drug effects.
This open-label phase I study (NCT00141297) enrolled patients who received PD 0332991 orally in six dose-escalation cohorts in a standard 3 + 3 design.
Forty-one patients were enrolled. DLTs were observed in five patients (12%) overall; at the 75, 125, and 150 mg once daily dose levels. The MTD and recommended phase II dose of PD 0332991 was 125 mg once daily. Neutropenia was the only dose-limiting effect. After cycle 1, grade 3 neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia occurred in five (12%), three (7%), and one (2%) patient(s), respectively. The most common non-hematologic adverse events included fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. Thirty-seven patients were evaluable for tumor response; 10 (27%) had stable disease for ≥4 cycles of whom six derived prolonged benefit (≥10 cycles). PD 0332991 was slowly absorbed (median T(max), 5.5 hours), and slowly eliminated (mean half-life was 25.9 hours) with a large volume of distribution (mean, 2,793 L). The area under the concentration-time curve increased linearly with dose. Using an E(max) model, neutropenia was shown to be proportional to exposure.
PD 0332991 warrants phase II testing at 125 mg once daily, at which dose neutropenia was the sole significant toxicity.
Skin rashes, proteinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis and myasthenia gravis have all been recorded as complications of penicillamine therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A patient who had developed all 5 is now described. The skin lesion resembled elastosis perforans serpiginosa, which has been reported as a rare side effect in patients with Wilson's disease but not in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with penicillamine.
Previous studies have show that changes in protein kinase C (PKC) isoform expression may be related to increased susceptibility of copper-deficient rats to aberrant crypt formation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary copper would affect azoxymethane-induced intestinal tumor formation and PKC isozyme expression in normal colonic mucosa and tumor samples. Eighty weanling Fischer-344 rats were randomly assigned to diets that contained either 0.8 or 5.3 microg Cu/g diet. After 24 and 31 d of diet consumption, 30 rats/diet were administered azoxymethane (15 mg/kg i.p.) and 10 rats/diet were administered saline. Rats continued to consume their respective diets for an additional 38 wk. Rats injected with azoxymethane and fed the low copper diet had a significantly (P < 0.0001) greater small intestinal and total tumor incidence compared with rats fed adequate dietary copper. However, dietary copper did not affect colon tumor incidence. Low dietary copper significantly (P < 0.004) decreased PKC alpha protein expression in normal but not in tumor tissue. In contrast, low dietary copper did not affect PKC delta or zeta protein expression in either the normal or tumor tissue. PKC alpha and delta protein and mRNA expression were lower in tumor tissue than in normal tissue. These results along with previous observations suggest that dietary copper-mediated changes in PKC alpha, delta and zeta protein expression are not as important for colon tumor promotion/progression as they are for tumor initiation.
Chronic renin-angiotensin system inhibition protects against liver fibrosis, ameliorates age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and increases rodent lifespan. We hypothesized that life-long angiotensin-II-mediated stimulation of oxidant generation might participate in mitochondrial DNA "common deletion" formation, and the resulting impairment of bioenergetic capacity. Enalapril (10 mg/kg/d) or losartan (30 mg/kg/d) administered during 16.5 months were unable to prevent the age-dependent accumulation of rat liver mitochondrial DNA "common deletion", but attenuated the decrease of mitochondrial DNA content. This evidence - together with the enhancement of NRF-1 and PGC-1 mRNA contents - seems to explain why enalapril and losartan improved mitochondrial functioning and lowered oxidant production, since both the absolute number of mtDNA molecules and increased NRF-1 and PGC-1 transcription are positively related to mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and PGC-1 protects against increases in ROS production and damage. Oxidative stress evoked by abnormal respiratory function contributes to the pathophysiology of mitochondrial disease and human aging. If the present mitochondrial actions of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are confirmed in humans they may modify the therapeutic significance of that strategy.
The risk of skin lesions associated with arsenic exposure from drinking water in Bangladesh is considerably greater in men than in women.
Using baseline data from 11,062 cohort members in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study in Araihazar, Bangladesh, we performed a cross-sectional analysis to evaluate whether the association between arsenic exposure from drinking water and the risk of skin lesions is modified by tobacco smoking, excessive sunlight, the use of fertilizer, and the use of pesticides. A time-weighted well arsenic concentration was estimated for each participant by incorporating history of well use. Relative excess risk for interaction (RERI) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using adjusted prevalence odds ratios.
We observed a synergistic effect between the highest level of arsenic exposure (> 113 microg/L) and tobacco smoking on risk of skin lesions in men (RERI = 1.5 [95% CI = 0.3 to 2.7] overall and 1.7 [0.2 to 3.4] for the subpopulation with longer-term arsenic exposure). We also observed suggestive synergistic effects between higher levels (28.1-113.0 microg/L and 113.1-864.0 microg/L) of arsenic exposure and fertilizer use in men (RERI = 1.0 [-0.2 to 2.2] and 1.3 [-0.2 to 2.9] respectively). Furthermore, the risk of skin lesions associated with any given level of arsenic exposure was greater in men with excessive sun exposure. The patterns of effect estimates in women indicate similar-but-weaker interaction effects of arsenic exposure with tobacco smoking and fertilizer use.
These findings help explain why the risk of arsenic-related skin lesions was much greater in men than in women in Bangladesh. Because most arsenic-induced skin cancers arise from these skin lesions, treatment and remediation plans should take into consideration these etiologic cofactors.
The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced catatonia in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions. Serotonin and N-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so. This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat. In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia rather than directly on the pituitary.
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), can be aggravated by a mild Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. This study was performed to assess whether treatment with antibiotics inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis reduces the detrimental effect of infection on the course of EAE.
In vitro, release of proinflammatory pneumococcal products was studied by enzyme immunoassay and western blot. Seven days after induction of EAE (prior to the onset of symptoms) mice were infected intraperitoneally with S. pneumoniae and treated either with the inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis minocycline or rifampicin, or with the beta-lactam ceftriaxone.
During bacterial killing in vitro, minocycline and rifampicin released lower quantities of proinflammatory bacterial products from S. pneumoniae than ceftriaxone. Mice treated with minocycline developed symptoms of EAE 1 day later than mice treated with ceftriaxone. Neither minocycline nor rifampicin therapy, however, reduced the severity of EAE in comparison with ceftriaxone treatment.
Although statistically significant (P = 0.04), a delay of 1 day in the onset of symptoms of EAE after minocycline treatment is of minor clinical relevance. These data do not support the hypothesis of superiority of a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor over a beta-lactam antibiotic for the treatment of concomitant infections during the latent phase of EAE or MS.
To explore the efficacy of small dose of intratympanic gentamicin injection on intractable Meniere's disease.
Retrospectively study the efficacy of gentamicin intratympanic injection on intractable Meniere's disease. The end-point of treatment was determined based on bedside tests (Spontaneous Nystagmus test, Head shaking test and Head Thrust test), hearing tests, or the improvement of patients symptoms.
Nineteen patients with Meniere's disease were treated with intratympanic gentamicin injection. Vertigo control was achieved in 17 patients (89%). Of them, vertigo of 5 patients was successfully controlled after single injection. Eight patients need double injections and 4 patients need the third injections to control the vertigo. Endolymphatic sac shunt was performed to 1 patient because he could not tolerate the fullness of ear due to injection. The remainder 2 patients with double injections showed no improvement of vertigo and rejected further treatment. Hearing was improved in two patients after gentamicin injection. Three patients complained of hearing loss after intratympanic gentamicin injection. The hearing of the other patients did not change.
Three weeks after using small dose of gentamicin intratympanic injection to treat intractable Meniere's disease, it was determined whether more injections is required. The results showed that by using this approach, the vertigo could be effectively controlled and the risk of hearing loss following intratympanic gentamicin injection could be reduced.
Acase in which a 26 year old patient with undifferentiated schizophrenia, showing abnormal oral, lingual and jaw movements suggestive of tardive dyskinesia during a dose reduction of risperidone, is presented. A second case, relating to a 39 year old married woman diagnosed as having a DSM-IV schizophreniform disorder is also presented. These two cases are discussed in relation to the existing literature.
