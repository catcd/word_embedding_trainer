To determine cocaine's toxicity in different organs, BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected daily for 15 days with either saline or cocaine: 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or 60 mg/kg. Cardiac function, hepatic pathophysiology, heart and liver apoptosis, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) levels were analyzed. After administration of cocaine, cardiac function decreased. Inflammatory cell infiltration and eosinophilic contraction bands were visible in the hearts of mice treated with 60mg/kg cocaine. Moreover, histopathology demonstrated that cocaine caused hepatic necrosis. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining and DNA ladder analysis indicated that cocaine caused apoptosis in both the heart and liver. Moreover, immunoassay showed that TNF-alpha levels significantly increased in the heart and liver with cocaine administration. However, our RT-PCR study showed that there was no significant difference in either the heart or liver in the levels of mRNA for TNF-alpha between cocaine-treated and saline control mice. The present study demonstrated that cocaine is toxic to multiple organs, and at low dose can induce hepatic damage without gross pathological injury to the heart. The results suggest that the liver is more sensitive than the heart to cocaine toxicity, and induction of apoptosis or TNF-alpha elevation may be a common mechanism responsible for cocaines toxicity.
The aim of this study was to report a series of patients with stress cardiomyopathy precipitated by the intravenous administration of catecholamines and beta-receptor agonists.
Stress cardiomyopathy is a syndrome of transient cardiac dysfunction precipitated by intense emotional or physical stress. Excessive sympathetic stimulation is believed to be central to the pathogenesis of this disorder, but a causal link has not been convincingly demonstrated.
We observed 9 cases of stress cardiomyopathy precipitated immediately by the intravenous administration of epinephrine (n = 6) or dobutamine (n = 3). Patients were evaluated with coronary angiography and with serial echocardiography, electrocardiography, and cardiac enzymes.
The median age was 44 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 30 to 48 years), and 7 (78%) were woman. Troponin-I was mildly elevated (median 4.07 ng/ml, IQR: 0.47 to 5.63 ng/ml), but none of the patients undergoing angiography had obstructive coronary disease. All patients developed corrected QT interval (QTc interval) prolongation (median QTc interval 504 ms, IQR: 477 to 568 ms) within 24 h of receiving drug. All 3 previously described variants of left ventricular "ballooning" (apical, midventricular, and basal) were observed. The median ejection fraction on admission was 35% (IQR: 35% to 40%). During follow-up (median 7 days, IQR: 4 to 13 days) there was recovery of left ventricular systolic function in all patients (median ejection fraction 55%, IQR: 40% to 60%, p < 0.001 vs. admission).
Exposure to catecholamines and beta-receptor agonists used routinely during procedures and diagnostic tests can precipitate all the features of stress cardiomyopathy, including cardiac isoenzyme elevation, QTc interval prolongation, and rapidly reversible cardiac dysfunction. These observations strongly implicate excessive sympathetic stimulation as central to the pathogenesis of this unique syndrome.
Metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have risen to alarming proportions, and there is a need for therapeutic and preventive measures. The polyphenol resveratrol (RES) protects against CVDs, but in vivo molecular mechanisms responsible for protection are not yet understood. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) are involved in the development of atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. The identification of PBMNCs genes responding to dietary compounds might help to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of polyphenols. We determined gene expression differences between PBMNCs from pigs fed a high-fat diet manifesting a mild increase of cholesterol and pigs fed a high-fat diet containing low doses of RES. Although the consumption of RES did not modify the levels of cholesterol, microarray analyses indicated that some of the differentially expressed genes, collagens (COL1A, COL3A), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and fatty-acid binding proteins (FABPs) involved in CVDs and lipid metabolism were up-regulated by the high-fat diet and down-regulated by RES. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed that RES and RES-containing grape extract prevented the induction of FABP4 in PBMNCs in female pigs fed a high-fat diet. Low micromolar concentrations of RES and its metabolite dihydroresveratrol exerted a minor but significant reducing effect on the induction of FABP4 expression in human macrophages treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Our results show that the consumption of low doses of RES modulates the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and metabolic disorders that are affected by a high-fat diet and suggest that some of the circulating RES metabolites may contribute to these effects.
The effect of reversible blood-brain barrier modification on the delivery of Adriamycin to the brain was studied in a rodent and canine model. Pharmacokinetic and physiological studies were done in these animals after a wide range of doses of Adriamycin (0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg) were administered into the carotid artery following osmotic barrier modification with mannitol. In the absence of barrier modification, no immunoreactive Adriamycin was detected in the cerebrum; whereas, following barrier modification, up to 4.5 micrograms of drug and/or metabolites per g of brain were found. Optimum tissue levels of Adriamycin and metabolites were achieved following barrier modification when the drug was administered by either bolus or slow continuous (15-min) infusion. Immunoreactive drug was identified in brain for up to 6 hr after administration. Significant functional neurotoxicity occurred at all dose levels, even at 0.1 mg/kg, a level at which Adriamycin concentration in the brain was below the level of detectability. Neuropathological examination revealed the presence of necrosis and hemorrhagic infarcts. Thus, these pharmacological and toxicity studies suggest that Adriamycin (or its metabolites) may produce significant clinical neurotoxicity when even small amounts penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
Hyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrinology disorders. Treatment can be either pharmacological, surgical or using radioactive iodine. In Europe methimazole is the antithyroid drug of choice because it can be administered in a single daily dose and has a lower risk of adverse reactions. Around 5% of patients taking thionamides can present any of their side effects, which are usually mild. Liver toxicity due to thionamides is very rare, and severe due to propylthiouracil. We present a clinical case of a cholestatic jaundice and acute toxic hepatitis due to methimazole and a cross-reaction with propylthiouracil. Based on this case a review is presented.
Immunoprophylaxis using intravenous (IV) hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) decreases the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). However, IV HBIG is expensive, has significant side effects, and is inconvenient to administer. An alternative approach for prophylaxis using intramuscular (IM) HBIG and oral lamivudine was prospectively evaluated in this study. Ten consecutive patients with cirrhosis with HBV infection who underwent OLT were included in this study. Nine of 10 patients received lamivudine, 150 mg/d, for an average duration of 8.6 months before OLT. Two of 10 patients with detectable HBV DNA at the time of OLT received 10,000 U (45 mL) of IV HBIG daily for 7 consecutive days, followed by 5 mL of IM HBIG weekly for the next 3 weeks, then every 3 weeks. The other 8 patients were HBV DNA negative at OLT and received one dose of IV HBIG (45 mL) during surgery, followed by 5 mL of IM HBIG weekly for 4 weeks, then every 3 weeks. All patients received lamivudine, 150 mg/d, after OLT. During a mean follow-up of 15.6 months, 9 of 10 patients achieved a protective hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titer greater than 200 IU/L and had no evidence of HBV recurrence. One patient failed to develop an adequate HBsAb titer and developed histological and virological evidence of recurrence. One patient died unrelated to HBV recurrence. Our preliminary data suggest that this combination prophylaxis with IM HBIG and lamivudine is effective and potentially cost saving.
High doses of methamphetamine (METH) cause the depletion of striatal dopaminergic markers; however, little is known about the behavioral consequences of METH-induced neurotoxicity. In the present study, the authors investigated the effect of a neurotoxic dose of METH (5 mg/kg; every 3 h x3) on the subsequent response of Swiss Webster mice to (a) the psychomotor-stimulating effect of METH and (b) the acquisition and maintenance of conditioned place preference (CPP) by METH. The latter is a paradigm for the assessment of the rewarding properties of abused substances. The administration of the high dose of METH resulted in significant depletion of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites and dopamine transporter (DAT) binding sites in the striatum. The dopaminergic markers were below control levels until the 95th day after METH administration. METH-pretreated mice were sensitized to the psychomotor-stimulating effect of METH (1 mg/kg) as determined on Days 3 and 74 after the initial exposure to the neurotoxic dose of METH. However, the acquisition of CPP by METH (0.5 mg/kg) was markedly reduced in the mice pretreated with the neurotoxic dose of METH compared with the control group. The CPP was maintained for 8 weeks in the control group but not in the METH group. A priming injection of METH (0.5 mg/kg) caused marked reinstatement of place preference in the control group; this response was maintained for three additional weeks. However, the priming injection of METH resulted in diminished place preference in the METH group and the conditioned response dissipated within 3 weeks. These findings suggest that METH-induced striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity is associated with two opposing and long-lasting behavioral outcomes: (a) sensitization to the psychomotor-stimulating effect of the drug and (b) desensitization to the rewarding properties of the drug. These consequences may be relevant to the psychopathology of METH abuse.
Abnormal signal transmission in central serotonergic pathways is supposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine and major depression. We report on a patient, who was treated during an episode of depression with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline and developed frequent migraine attacks under this therapeutical regime. Single migraine attacks were treated successfully with triptanes. Although SSRIs may be beneficial for migraine prophylaxis at long term administration, this case suggests that acute administration of SSRIs in migraineurs may include the risk of worsening migraine.
Current protocols for prophylaxis against allograft reinfection after liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection include the administration of large doses of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), with considerable associated economic costs. Monotherapeutic prophylaxis with lamivudine has been complicated by the development of resistant strains of HBV. We studied the effectiveness of a posttransplantation prophylaxis protocol using combination lamivudine and low-dose HBIG in 7 consecutive patients with chronic HBV infection, 4 of whom were serum HBV DNA positive before pretransplantation lamivudine therapy. All patients were serum HBV DNA negative at transplantation and received lamivudine, 100 mg/d, posttransplantation. HBIG, 2170 IU, was administered intramuscularly intraoperatively and daily for 14 days. Maintenance HBIG therapy consisted of 2170 IU intramuscularly twice weekly, tapered to every 2 to 4 weeks by 12 months posttransplantation. Target serum HBIG (HBV surface antibody) titers were less than 500 IU/L for 6 months, then greater than 300 IU/L until 12 months posttransplantation. Induction serum HBIG titers were determined daily in 5 patients, and both serum HBIG and hepatitis B surface antigen were determined every 4 weeks in all patients. One patient died 61 days posttransplantation; the surviving patients (n = 6) were followed up for a mean of 532 days (range, 395 to 648 days). No patient has developed allograft reinfection. In the induction period, a target HBIG titer of greater than 500 IU/L was not achieved until a mean of 6.8 days (range, 5 to 10 days). In the maintenance period, all patients achieved the target HBIG titer. This suggests combination lamivudine and low-dose HBIG is effective in preventing allograft reinfection by HBV.
Recurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. Recently, antiviral therapy, such as lamivudine, has become available for prophylaxis against HBV reactivation posttransplantation and for the treatment of HBV recurrent disease. We report our initial experience with lamivudine therapy in patients with precore mutant-associated HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation (n = 29). Outcomes were compared in three patient groups: group 1, precore mutant HBV infection not receiving lamivudine (n = 10); group 2, recurrent precore mutant HBV infection posttransplantation subsequently treated with lamivudine (n = 10); and group 3, HBV precore mutant patients undergoing liver transplantation and receiving lamivudine and low-dose hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) from the time of transplantation (n = 9). In group 1, HBV recurred in 9 of 10 patients, with subsequent graft loss in all 9 patients. In group 2, all patients developed HBV recurrence at a mean of 7.3 months posttransplantation and started lamivudine therapy at a median of 16 months posttransplantation. Follow-up on lamivudine therapy was for a median of 11 months. Six of these 10 patients developed mutations in the HBV polymerase gene associated with lamivudine resistance. There were two liver failure-related deaths in this group. In group 3 patients, there was one death from graft-versus-host disease. The remaining 8 patients have been followed up for a mean of 15.6 months posttransplantation, and all remain hepatitis B surface antigen negative and HBV DNA negative. In conclusion, lamivudine therapy in association with low-dose HBIG is effective in preventing HBV reactivation posttransplantation. Rescue therapy with lamivudine in patients with HBV recurrence is only moderately effective, with a 60% lamivudine resistance rate in patients treated for longer than 6 months.
Administration of 2-methoxyethanol to pregnant rats on day 12 of gestation induced ventral duplication of the autopod, presumably via its oxidative metabolite, methoxyacetic acid. Morphological observations indicate that the limb bud periderm is severely damaged by methoxyacetic acid so that large patches of this structure are actually missing during an extended period of limb bud development. A high concentration of methoxyacetic acid (10 mM) was found in the extraembryonic fluid and we postulate that the damage to the periderm was initiated from this extraembryonic exposure. The ventral duplication of the autopod is thought to arise through an attempt by the embryo to repair the periderm lesion.
Quinones have diverse pharmacological properties including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and anticancer activity. The cytotoxic potential of 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ14) was studied against B16F1 melanoma cells grown in vitro. NQ14 treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity as indicated by MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay. Depletion in cellular glutathione levels after 1h incubation with NQ14 correlated with the corresponding increase in reactive oxygen species generation as determined by 2',7'-dicholorofluorescein diacetate assay suggests the role of oxidative stress in cell death. The frequency of micronucleated binucleate cells increased with increasing doses of NQ14 with a corresponding decrease in the cytokinesis block proliferation index indicating the drug induced genotoxicity and cell division delay. Further, a dose-dependent decrease in the clonogenic cell survival indicated the potential of NQ14 to inhibit cell proliferation contributing to cell death. The cell death after NQ14 treatment may be attributed to apoptosis as seen in DNA ladder pattern along with necrosis as indicated in flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V/PI stained cells. Results of the present study demonstrate the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of NQ14 by the induction of oxidative stress mediated mechanisms leading to tumor cell kill.
A 69-yr-old man, who was concurrently being treated with pilocarpine nitrate and timolol maleate eye drops, developed a bradycardia and became hypotensive during halothane anaesthesia. Both timolol and pilocarpine were subsequently identified in a 24-h collection of urine. Timolol (but not pilocarpine) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery; the plasma concentration of timolol (2.6 ng ml-1) was consistent with partial beta-adrenoceptor blockade. It is postulated that this action may have been enhanced during halothane anaesthesia with resultant bradycardia and hypotension. Pilocarpine may have had a contributory effect.
For palliation of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (R/M HNSCC), the major classes of commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are platinum agents (cisplatin, carboplatin), taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), and antimetabolic agents (methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil). Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, also shows modest activity against R/M HNSCC. Because the overall management of patients with R/M HNSCC often involves multidisciplinary input, this review focuses on data that help guide decision-making in scenarios in which palliative chemotherapy is planned. Avenues for ongoing research are also presented.
In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), malignant cells seem to be arrested in the G(0)/early G(1) phase of the cell cycle, and defective apoptosis might be involved in disease progression. However, increasing evidence exists that B-CLL is more than a disease consisting of slowly accumulating resting B cells: a proliferating pool of cells has been described in lymph nodes and bone marrow and might feed the accumulating pool in the blood. Rapamycin has been reported to inhibit cell cycle progression in a variety of cell types, including human B cells, and has shown activity against a broad range of human tumor cell lines. Therefore, we investigated the ability of rapamycin to block cell cycle progression in proliferating B-CLL cells. We have recently demonstrated that stimulation with CpG-oligonucleotides and interleukin-2 provides a valuable model for studying cell cycle regulation in malignant B cells. In our present study, we demonstrated that rapamycin induced cell cycle arrest in proliferating B-CLL cells and inhibited phosphorylation of p70s6 kinase (p70(s6k)). In contrast to previous reports on nonmalignant B cells, the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 was not changed in rapamycin-treated leukemic cells. Treatment with rapamycin prevented retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation in B-CLL cells without affecting the expression of cyclin D2, but cyclin D3 was no longer detectable in rapamycin-treated B-CLL cells. In addition, rapamycin treatment inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by preventing up-regulation of cyclin E and cyclin A. Interestingly, survivin, which is expressed in the proliferation centers of B-CLL patients in vivo, is not up-regulated in rapamycin-treated cells. Therefore, rapamycin interferes with the expression of many critical molecules for cell cycle regulation in cycling B-CLL cells. We conclude from our study that rapamycin might be an attractive substance for therapy for B-CLL patients by inducing a G(1) arrest in proliferating tumor cells.
We studied the effects of CGP 35348, a centrally active blocker of GABAB receptors, on scopolamine-induced amnesia for a passive avoidance response in the mouse. Both pre-training or post-training intraperitoneal administration of the GABAB antagonist (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reduces the amnesic effect of scopolamine (1.0 mg/kg i.p.). Our results are in agreement with previous observations indicating a role for the GABAB receptors in the modulation of memory function, and suggest a possible role of GABAB receptor antagonists as nootropic drugs.
Previous studies of the association between the use of appetite suppressants and valvular heart disease have not accounted for the effects of valvular structure and aortic root diameter, which are associated with obesity. We assessed whether the use of the appetite suppressants fenfluramine/dexfenfluramine, either alone or with phentermine, was associated with aortic regurgitation while adjusting for these variables.
The sample included 2524 adult participants in the population-based Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network study. Information regarding current drug use was assessed during a clinical examination. Medication use was continued at the time of echocardiographic study. Expert readers blinded to current therapy read echocardiograms centrally at Cornell Medical Center. Analyses of the associations between use of fenfluramine/dexfenfluramine (alone or with phentermine) and aortic regurgitation adjusted for potential confounders, including aortic root dilatation and valve fibrocalcification.
Nineteen participants, all of whom had hypertension, were being treated with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine (5 on these agents alone, 14 also with phentermine). Aortic regurgitation was present in 32% (n = 6) of those taking fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine versus 6% (162/2505) of remaining subjects (P = 0.001). In multivariate-adjusted analyses, treatment with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine was associated with aortic regurgitation (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7 to 14) and aortic fibrocalcification (OR = 5.2; 95% CI: 1.9 to 15).
In a population-based sample, use of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine, alone or in combination with phentermine, was associated with aortic regurgitation independent of aortic dilatation or fibrocalcification.
Male rats of the BDIX strain were about twice as sensitive to the lethal effects of intravenously infused ouabain than were their female counterparts. This sex difference in ouabain sensitivity was not exhibited by rats of the Wistar strain. In bile duct-cannulated animals, ouabain biliary excretion was much faster in female BDIX rats. This finding could partly explain the greater ouabain resistance, although certain aspects of the cardiac/plasma ouabain concentration data did suggest that there may have been a component of the sex-related resistance that was not explicable on a pharmacokinetic basis. The faster ouabain biliary excretion in female rats could also partly explain the fact that for similar rates of infusion, the plasma ouabain concentration during infusion was similar in both sexes, despite the body size of the female rats being about one-third smaller.
In a previous in situ hybridization study, we demonstrated the mRNA expression of napsin, an aspartic protease of the pepsin family, in the kidney, lung, and lymphoid organs of mice. However, findings on the cellular localization of napsin at the protein level are controversial, and no information on the subcellular localization is available. The present immunohistochemical study revealed the cellular and subcellular localization of napsin in mice and rats, and also analyzed the influences of chemical-induced proteinuria on the renal expression of this enzyme in rats. Immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody against mouse napsin showed that napsin immunoreactivity was noticeable in lysosomes of renal proximal tubule cells and in lamellar bodies of pulmonary type II alveolar cells. In the lung, immunoreactivity was also found in lysosomes of alveolar macrophages and on the surface of type I alveolar cells; the immunoreactivities in these cells may be due to the uptake and adhesion of napsin secreted from type II alveolar cells, since they did not express napsin mRNA. Conversely, immunoreactivity for napsin was undetectable in B lymphocytes with intense mRNA expression. In puromycin- or doxorubicin-induced proteinuria, napsin mRNA expression was markedly elevated in renal proximal tubules, showing characteristic distribution patterns. Immunostaining of kidneys with proteinuria showed intense immunoreactivity for napsin in congested and enlarged lysosomes, called protein absorption droplets. These results indicate that napsin functions as a lysosomal protease and is involved in protein catabolism in renal proximal tubules.
This study compares a continuous infusion technique with intermittent "top-up" doses using 0.25 per cent bupivacaine for epidural analgesia for labour and delivery in healthy primiparous patients. Sixty women were randomized into two groups, A (continuous) and B (intermittent). Twenty-eight patients in Group A and 29 in Group B completed the study. We compared the groups with regard to satisfaction with pain relief for both labour and delivery as measured by a Visual Analogue Scale on five occasions during and after parturition. There was no difference between groups at any of the five stages. The difference in pain scores before the epidural and after the epidural was significant for both groups (p less than 0.001). The incidence of missed segments, degrees of motor block, height of sensory block, length of labour and fetal outcome were similar in both groups. Plasma bupivacaine levels were measured in six patients in each group. Mothers in Group A received more drug than those in Group B (p less than 0.01) but plasma bupivacaine levels remained low in the mother and the umbilical cord samples in the sub-set from this group. More women in Group A required outlet forceps (p less than 0.05) whereas mid-forceps and Caesarean section rates were similar in the two groups. Fewer mothers in the infusion group had spontaneous vaginal delivery. We conclude that infusion techniques are as effective as intermittent top-up epidurals and are well received by mothers in labour.
Benzene and 13 potential metabolites were investigated for genotoxicity in Salmonella typhimurium and V79 Chinese hamster cells. In the presence of NADPH-fortified hepatic postmitochondrial fraction (S9 mix), benzene reverted his- S. typhimurium strains. The effect was strongest in strain TA1535. Among the potential metabolites, only the trans-1,2-dihydrodiol, in the presence of S9 mix, and the diol epoxides, in the presence and absence of S9 mix, proved mutagenic in this strain. The anti-diol epoxide was more potent than the syn-diastereomer. Both enantiomers of the anti-diastereomer showed similar activities. S9 mix did not appreciably affect the mutagenicity of the anti-diol epoxide. However, detoxification was observed when purified rat liver dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.20) was used at concentrations comparable to that present in the liver. The (1S)-anti-diol epoxide was a much better substrate than the (1R)-enantiomer, as was true also for (1S)-versus (1R)-trans-1,2-dihydrodiol. The anti-diol epoxide reverted all six strains of S. typhimurium used and induced all four genotoxic effects studied in V79 cells (sister chromatid exchange greater than acquisition of 6-thioguanine resistance, acquisition of ouabain resistance, micronuclei). However, other potential benzene metabolites showed genotoxic effects in V79 cells, as well: sister chromatid exchange was induced by the syn-diol epoxide, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, hydroquinone, catechol, and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene. Elevated frequencies of micronucleated cells were observed after treatment with hydroquinone, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, catechol, phenol, 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene, and quinone. Mutations to 6-thioguanine resistance were induced by quinone, hydroquinone, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, catechol, and the trans-1,2-dihydrodiol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
In Sjögren's syndrome (SS), oral dryness (xerostomia) is frequently the most bothersome symptom. An H2 histamine receptor antagonist is often administered to SS patients to treat associated superficial gastritis. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of nizatidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, to also relieve xerostomia in patients with primary SS. Twenty-seven patients with primary SS were randomly assigned to receive nizatidine (n=14, 300 mg a day) or another H2 blocker, famotidine (n=13, 40 mg a day; control), were followed for eight weeks, and were asked for both subjective and objective assessments of oral dryness using a visual analog scale (VAS; 1-100 mm) and the Saxon's test, respectively. Patients receiving oral nizatidine, but not famotidine, obtained significant objective relief from their xerostomia (Saxon's test; baseline, 0.57 g/2 min; after eight weeks, 0.90 g/2 min, P<0.05). VAS scores indicated that nizatidine also provides mild improvement (20% improvement over baseline) of xerostomia-related clinical conditions, including mouth dryness and difficulty in chewing, tasting and swallowing food. Both drugs were generally well tolerated, without adverse effects. The present preliminary study suggests that nizatidine may represent a new option for the treatment of xerostomia in SS.
Two heavy abusers of cocaine experienced dysphoric hypersomnolent withdrawal following abrupt cessation of use. Desipramine quickly reversed the withdrawal symptoms in both patients, although it did not prevent their future use of cocaine.
After developing subarachnoid hemorrhage, patients may deteriorate from a variety of well-known causes, including rebleeding, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Many patients now undergo empirical hyperdynamic vasospasm therapy with hypervolemia, induced hypertension, and nimodipine.
We report two cases of iatrogenic hypertensive encephalopathy occurring during hyperdynamic therapy for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a syndrome of rapidly evolving generalized or focal cerebral symptoms occurring in the setting of severe hypertension, which is reversible with antihypertensive therapy.
The syndrome can be diagnosed in the appropriate clinical setting with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging that demonstrates characteristic findings. In both cases, decreasing the blood pressure resulted in neurological improvement.
In the setting of induced hypertensive/hypervolemic therapy for vasospasm, hypertensive encephalopathy should be considered as a potentially reversible cause of delayed neurological decline.
Carcinoma of the urinary bladder appears to arise, in at least some cases, from carcinoma in situ developing in a field of atypical epithelial proliferation. There is both a spatial and temporal relationship between invasive and in situ bladder cancer, although the exact relationship between the noninvasive flat and papillary types of tumors is not known. Prenoeplastic bladder lesions are defined as irreversible, although not necessarily progressive, and an experimental animal model of the disease has been developed. The appearance of pleomorphic microvilli on the luminal surface of epithelial cells of the urinary bladders of Fischer rats is correlated with the irreversibility of hyperplastic epithelial lesions induced by feeding N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl] formamide (FANFT) to the test animals. This alteration can be visualized by scanning electron microscopy of cytologic and histologic preparations.
