1, 3-Butadiene (BD) is a high-efficiency carcinogen in rodents and was classified as a human carcinogen in 2008 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. However, its ability to induce genetic damage and the influence of metabolic polymorphisms to such damage in humans are both controversial claims. This study was conducted to investigate the relationships between exposure to BD, the polymorphisms of metabolic genes and the chromosomal damage in 45 pairs of occupationally exposed workers in a BD product workshop and matched control workers in an administrative office and circulatory water workshop in China. Exposure to BD was evaluated by personal sampling and stationary sampling. Different chromosomal damage endpoints in peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined using the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay; polymorphisms of metabolic genes [cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH)] in BD-exposed group were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The results show that the average BD measurements of the exposed group were significantly higher than those for the control group (a personal sampling and stationary sampling, respectively). The BD-exposed workers exhibited increased frequencies of micronuclei (MNi) (8.00 ± 3.78‰ versus 5.62 ± 2.41‰) and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) (2.58 ± 2.79‰ versus 1.13 ± 1.34‰) and a decreased nuclear division index (2.20 ± 0.14 versus 2.35 ± 0.27) when compared subjects in the control group. Meanwhile, BD-exposed workers carrying CYP2E1 c1c2/c2c2 or mEH intermediate (I)/high (H) group had a significantly higher NPB frequency than those carrying CYP2E1 c1c1 [frequency ratio (FR) = 2.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72-3.93; P < 0.0001) or the mEH low(S) group (FR = 2.06, 95% CI% 1.17-3.62; P < 0.05), respectively. Our study suggests that MNi and NPB frequency in CBMN cytome assay could be potential genotoxic biomarkers for BD exposure in humans. The polymorphism of CYP2E1 and mEH could also affect the chromosomal instability of BD workers.
Uterine cancer is a common cause for cancer death in women and there is no effective therapy for metastatic disease. Thus, research is urgently needed to identify new therapeutic agents. We showed previously that all female HMGA1a transgenic mice develop malignant uterine tumors, indicating that HMGA1a causes uterine cancer in vivo. We also demonstrated that HMGA1a up-regulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) during tumorigenesis in this model. Similarly, we found that HMGA1a and COX-2 are overexpressed in human leiomyosarcomas, a highly malignant uterine cancer. Although epidemiologic studies indicate that individuals who take COX inhibitors have a lower incidence of some tumors, these inhibitors have not been evaluated in uterine cancer. Here, we show that HMGA1a mice on sulindac (a COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor) have significantly smaller uterine tumors than controls. To determine if COX inhibitors are active in human uterine cancers that overexpress HMGA1a, we treated cultured cells with sulindac sulfide or celecoxib (a specific COX-2 inhibitor). Both drugs block anchorage-independent growth in high-grade human uterine cancer cells that overexpress HMGA1a (MES-SA cells). In contrast, neither inhibitor blocked transformation in cells that do not overexpress HMGA1a. Moreover, xenograft tumors from MES-SA cells were significantly inhibited in mice on sulindac. More strikingly, no tumors formed in mice on celecoxib. These preclinical studies suggest that COX inhibitors could play a role in preventing tumor onset or progression in uterine cancers with dysregulation of the HMGA1a-COX-2 pathway. Importantly, these drugs have lower toxicity than chemotherapeutic agents used to treat advanced-stage uterine cancers.
Stevens-Johnson syndrome and the related disease toxic epidermal necrolysis are life-threatening reactions of the skin to particular types of medication. Here we show that there is a strong association in Han Chinese between a genetic marker, the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by carbamazepine, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of seizures. It should be possible to exploit this association in a highly reliable test to predict severe adverse reaction, as well as for investigation of the pathogenesis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Acidosis and angiotensin II stimulate ammonia production and transport by the proximal tubule. We examined the modulatory effect of the type 1 angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan on the ability of metabolic acidosis to stimulate ammonia production and secretion by mouse S2 proximal tubule segments. Mice given NH(4)Cl for 7 days developed metabolic acidosis (low serum bicarbonate concentration) and increased urinary excretion of ammonia. S2 tubule segments from acidotic mice displayed higher rates of ammonia production and secretion compared with those from control mice. However, when losartan was coadministered in vivo with NH(4)Cl, both the acidosis-induced increase in urinary ammonia excretion and the adaptive increase in ammonia production and secretion of microperfused S2 segments were largely blocked. In renal cortical tissue, losartan blocked the acid-induced increase in brush-border membrane NHE3 expression but had no effect on the acid-induced upregulation of phosphate-dependent glutaminase or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 in cortical homogenates. Addition of angiotensin II to the microperfusion solution enhanced ammonia secretion and production rates in tubules from NH(4)Cl-treated and control mice in a losartan-inhibitable manner. These results demonstrate that a 7-day acid challenge induces an adaptive increase in ammonia production and secretion by the proximal tubule and suggest that during metabolic acidosis, angiotensin II signaling is necessary for adaptive enhancements of ammonia excretion by the kidney and ammonia production and secretion by S2 proximal tubule segments, as mediated, in part, by angiotensin receptor-dependent enhancement of NHE3 expression.
Benzene is a ubiquitous occupational and environmental toxicant. Exposures to benzene both prenatally and during adulthood are associated with the development of disorders such as aplastic anemia and leukemia. Mechanisms of benzene toxicity are unknown; however, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by benzene metabolites may play a role. Little is known regarding the effects of benzene metabolites on erythropoiesis. Therefore, to determine the effects of in utero exposure to benzene on the growth and differentiation of fetal erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E), pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed to benzene and CFU-E numbers were assessed in fetal liver (hematopoietic) tissue. In addition, to determine the effect of benzene metabolite-induced ROS generation on erythropoiesis, HD3 chicken erythroblast cells were exposed to benzene, phenol, or hydroquinone followed by stimulation of erythrocyte differentiation. Our results show that in utero exposure to benzene caused significant alterations in female offspring CFU-E numbers. In addition, exposure to hydroquinone, but not benzene or phenol, significantly reduced the percentage of differentiated HD3 cells, which was associated with an increase in ROS. Pretreatment of HD3 cells with polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) prevented hydroquinone-induced inhibition of erythropoiesis, supporting the hypothesis that ROS generation is involved in the development of benzene erythrotoxicity. In conclusion, this study provided evidence that ROS generated as a result of benzene metabolism may significantly alter erythroid differentiation, potentially leading to the development of Blood Disorders.
All major guidelines for antihypertensive therapy recommend weight loss; anti-obesity drugs might be a helpful option.
To assess the long-term effects of pharmacologically induced reduction in body weight with orlistat, sibutramine or rimonabant on:- all cause mortality - cardiovascular morbidity - adverse events
- changes in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure - body weight reduction
Studies were obtained from computerised searches of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and from hand searches in reference lists and systematic reviews.
Randomized controlled trials in adult hypertensive patients with a study duration of at least 24 weeks comparing pharmacologic interventions (orlistat, sibutramine, rimonabant) for weight loss with placebo.
Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Studies were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (p>0.1). Otherwise, we used the random effects method and investigated the cause of heterogeneity.
Eight studies comparing orlistat or sibutramine to placebo fulfilled our inclusion criteria. No relevant studies investigating rimonabant for weight loss were identified. No study included mortality and cardiovascular morbidity as a pre-defined outcome. Incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher in orlistat treated vs. placebo treated patients. Most frequent side effects with sibutramine were dry mouth, constipation and headache. Patients assigned to weight loss diets, orlistat or sibutramine reduced their body weight more effectively than patients in the usual care/placebo groups. Blood pressure reduction in patients treated with orlistat was for systolic blood pressure (SBP): weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.0 to -0.9 mm Hg and for diastolic blood pressure (DBP): WMD -1.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -3.0 to -0.9 mm Hg. Meta-analysis showed DBP increase under therapy with sibutramine: WMD +3.2 mm Hg; 95%CI +1.4 to +4.9 mm Hg.
In patients with elevated blood pressure, orlistat and sibutramine reduced body weight to a similar degree. In the same trials, orlistat reduced blood pressure and sibutramine increased blood pressure. No trials investigating rimonabant in people with elevated blood pressure could be included. Long-term trials assessing the effect of orlistat, sibutramine and rimonabant on mortality and morbidity are needed.
Angiotensin II receptors of the AT1 subtype were very highly expressed in medroxyprogesterone-induced ductal adenocarcinomas of the mammary gland in BALB/c mice. AT1 receptors are associated only to neoplastic epithelial cells. Lobular adenocarcinomas expressed very few AT1 receptors and expressed AT2 receptors only in areas corresponding to peritumoral connective tissue. Binding to angiotensin converting enzyme was present in all adenocarcinomas studied and was higher in ductal than in lobular adenocarcinomas. Normal mammary gland did not express either angiotensin II receptors or angiotensin converting enzyme. The present results are the first demonstration of angiotensin receptor subtypes and converting enzyme in mammary adenocarcinomas differentially expressed in tumors of ductal and lobular origin. Localization of receptor subtypes could be useful to study the differentiation of mammary cells during experimental mammary carcinogenesis in mice.
We compared the clinical utility of additional intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy with the clinical utility of steroid pulse therapy in patients with IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease.
We enrolled 164 patients with Kawasaki disease who were treated with a single dose of IVIG (2 g/kg) and aspirin (30 mg/kg per day). Twenty-seven of these patients (16%) were resistant to the initial IVIG treatment. We compared the effectiveness of treatment strategies for the initial IVIG-resistant 27 patients, 14 of these patients were treated with additional IVIG therapy, and the other 13 patients were treated with steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg per day for 3 days).
Three patients in the group receiving additional IVIG treatment had coronary artery aneurysms (21.4%), no patients had coronary artery aneurysm in the steroid pulse therapy group; the difference in the incidence of coronary artery aneurysm was not statistically significant. The duration of high fever after additional treatment in the steroid pulse therapy group (1 ± 1.3 days) was significantly shorter than that in the additional IVIG treatment group (3 ± 2.4 days; P < 0.05). The medical costs were significantly lower in the steroid pulse therapy group than in the additional IVIG treatment group.
Steroid pulse therapy was useful to reduce the fever duration and medical costs for patients with Kawasaki disease. Steroid pulse therapy and additional IVIG treatment were not significantly different in terms of preventing the development of coronary artery aneurysm.
Hyperoxia contributes to acute lung injury in diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1 has been shown to modulate hyperoxic lung injury. The mechanistic role(s) of CYP1A1 in hyperoxic lung injury in vivo is not known. In this investigation, we hypothesized that Cyp1a1(-/-) mice would be more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than wild-type (WT) mice, and that the protective role of CYP1A1 is in part due to CYP1A1-mediated decrease in the levels of reactive oxygen species-mediated lipid hydroperoxides, e.g., F2-isoprostanes/isofurans, leading to attenuation of oxidative damage. Eight- to ten-week-old male WT (C57BL/6J) or Cyp1a1(-/-) mice were exposed to hyperoxia (>95% O2) or room air for 24-72 h. The Cyp1a1(-/-) mice were more susceptible to oxygen-mediated lung damage and inflammation than WT mice, as evidenced by increased lung weight/body weight ratio, lung injury, neutrophil infiltration, and augmented expression of IL-6. Hyperoxia for 24-48 h induced CYP1A expression at the mRNA, protein, and enzyme levels in liver and lung of WT mice. Pulmonary F2-isoprostane and isofuran levels were elevated in WT mice after hyperoxia for 24 h. On the other hand, Cyp1a1(-/-) mice showed higher levels after 48-72 h of hyperoxia exposure compared to WT mice. Our results support the hypothesis that CYP1A1 protects against hyperoxic lung injury by decreasing oxidative stress. Future research could lead to the development of novel strategies for prevention and/or treatment of acute lung injury.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemic injury. However, its molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) by IL-6 in the reactive oxygen species defense system after transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI).
IL-6 was injected in mice before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed for analysis of an IL-6R association after tFCI. Primary mouse cerebral cortical neurons were transfected with small interfering RNA probes targeted to IL-6Rα or gp130 and were used for chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay, luciferase promoter assay, and cell viability assay. Reduction in infarct volumes by IL-6 was measured after tFCI.
IL-6R was disrupted through a disassembly between IL-6Rα and gp130 associated by protein oxidation after reperfusion after tFCI. This suppressed phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and finally induced neuronal cell death through a decrease in manganese-superoxide dismutase. However, IL-6 injections prevented disruption of IL-6R against reperfusion after tFCI, consequently restoring activity of STAT3 through recovery of the binding of STAT3 to gp130. Moreover, IL-6 injections restored the transcriptional activity of the manganese-superoxide dismutase promoter through recovery of the recruitment of STAT3 to the manganese-superoxide dismutase promoter and reduced infarct volume after tFCI.
This study demonstrates that IL-6 has a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic injury through IL-6R-mediated STAT3 activation and manganese-superoxide dismutase expression.
Computed tomography scans of 15 long-term steroid users showed varying degrees of apparent cerebral atrophy, not expected at their ages (8 to 40 years). Most were suffering from autoimmune diseases. There appeared to be some correlation between dosage and degree of apparent atrophy. There was surprisingly little clinical evidence of cerebral dysfunction associated with this apparent atrophy. In two of the cases, the appearance of the brain improved following decrease or cessation of steroid use. Speculations are made on possible causes.
Effective new markers of pancreatic carcinoma are urgently needed. In a previous analysis of gene expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), we found that the tag for the mesothelin mRNA transcript was present in seven of eight SAGE libraries derived from pancreatic carcinomas but not in the two SAGE libraries derived from normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells. In this study, we evaluate the potential utility of mesothelin as a tumor marker for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Mesothelin mRNA expression was evaluated in pancreatic adenocarcinomas using reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization, whereas mesothelin protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
Using an online SAGE database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/SAGE), we found the tag for mesothelin to be consistently present in the mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer libraries but not in normal pancreas libraries. Mesothelin mRNA expression was confirmed by in situ hybridization in 4 of 4 resected primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas and by RT-PCR in 18 of 20 pancreatic cancer cell lines, whereas mesothelin protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in all 60 resected primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas studied. The adjacent normal pancreas in these 60 cases did not label, or at most only rare benign pancreatic ducts showed weak labeling for mesothelin.
Mesothelin is a new marker for pancreatic adenocarcinoma identified by gene expression analysis. Mesothelin overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma has potential diagnostic, imaging, and therapeutic implications.
A most convenient model to study mechanisms of live organism response to chemical carcinogens is tumor induction in murine liver by aminoazodyes, in particular by ortho-aminoazotoluene (OAT). We studied both early and late stages of hepatocarcinogenesis on several lines of inbred mice differing in sensibility to OAT. By means of autoradiography, we examined proliferative activity of hepatocytes obtained from the liver of sensitive (A/He, DD, SWR) and resistant to OAT AKR, CC57Br, BALB/c lines of mice, which were injected carcinogen. The level of p53, p21Cip1, bax, mdm2, cyclin G, gadd45 genes expression in the liver of mice of different lines given OAT injection was studied by multiplex PCR method. Carcinogen caused a decrease of hepatocyte proliferative activity induced by partial hypatectomy (PHE), and an increase in p53, p21Cip, bax, mdm2, and cyclin G genes within mice of A/He, DD and SWR lines. Cell fusion experiments on hepatocytes obtained from regenerating murine liver sensitive to A/He line carcinogen and given long-time OAT administrations with resting and proliferating fibroblasts of NIH 3T3 mice revealed no obvious suppression of DNA synthesis in heterokaryons. Unlike, in fusion experiments on serum-stimulated fibroblasts with hepatocytes obtained from the liver of BALB/c line mice also given OAT suppression of DNA synthesis in stimulated fibroblasts in heterokaryons was observed 15 days following PHE. These results enable us to conclude that OAT administrations break negative endogenous mechanisms of hepatocyte proliferation control in the liver of mice sensitive to carcinogenes.
We describe four patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) who developed significant neurotoxicity after receiving short-term ciprofloxacin. Three of them had developed encephalopathy with myoclonic jerks and one patient had delirium. All patients had advanced chronic renal failure (mean estimated creatinine clearance 16 +/- 6 ml/minute), although they were not yet on renal replacement therapy. The mean received dose of ciprofloxacin was 2150 +/- 1300 mg and symptoms started to appear after the first 24 hours of drug intake. Investigations ruled out other possible causes of these neurological presentations, and withdrawal of ciprofloxacin was followed by complete resolution, after a mean of 8.5 +/- 4 days. Advanced renal failure in all patients and underlying neurologic diseases in two patients may have predisposed them to the neurotoxicity. The report of these cases should help to draw the attention of clinicians to the potential occurrence of these adverse effects in patients with CRF.
Three cases are presented. Withdrawal symptoms and ultimately psychosis developed in two cases following cessation of the hypno-sedative zolpidem. Two cases involve dependence upon and abuse of the drug; in one, a well-known alcoholic, it was abused in combination with alcohol, the other had prior well-known dependence on sedative hypnotics. One patient had chronic dysphoria and one encephalopatia toxica. Adverse effects such as withdrawal symptoms, dependence and abuse have not previously been reported in relation to zolpidem. Chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines, zolpidem is thought to have fewer adverse effects, but shares a pharmacokinetic profile with the benzodiazepine triazolam. It is advised that normal criteria for the prescription of benzodiazepines also be used when prescribing non-benzodiazepine sedatives and hypnotics, as they act upon the same receptor, namely the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride complex.
To evaluate the antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine (OLZ) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and drug-induced psychosis (DIP) and its repercussion on the motor function.
Ten patients (5 women and 5 men) diagnosed of PD and DIP, aged 67 years (range: 50-81), with PD duration of 11.1 years (range: 6-23), treated chronically with levodopa per day, received a dose of 2.5 or 5.0 mg OLZ daily. Data concerning improvement of psychosis and worsening of motor function was based on Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) and Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor.
Psychotic symptoms were improved in all patients. In most of them the improvement was almost total. Seven patients increased levodopa dose on OLZ, but significant worsening of motor function was reported just in one patient. None of the patients had agranulocytosis in the blood monitoring. Two patients presented weight gain. Seven patients improved their cognitive status.
We conclude that OLZ at the doses studied may have efficacy for DIP which appears in PD and does not induce worsening of motor function in most of the patients.
Acupuncture has been used to treat drug addiction by nicotine, alcohol, cocaine and morphine. This study was designed to investigate the effect of bee venom (BV) acupuncture on hyperactivity and hyperthermia induced by acute exposure to methamphetamine (METH, 1mg/kg, s.c.) in mice. Diluted BV (20μl of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10mg/ml in saline, s.c.) was administered bilaterally into the Zusanli acupoint (ST36) or control points (SP9 or GB39 or tail base). BV injection into ST36 dose dependently reduced METH-induced hyperactivity and hyperthermia, while BV injection (1mg/ml) into control points did not produce these suppressive effects. METH injection significantly increased Fos expression in several brain regions including nucleus accumbens (NA), caudate putamen (CPU), ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC). Interestingly, BV (1mg/ml) injection into ST36 further increased METH-induced Fos expression in NA (core and shell), SN and LC. When we performed sciatic denervation or combination treatment of BV and lidocaine (BV diluted in 5% lidocaine solution), the enhancement of Fos elevation by BV was completely blocked in the NA, SN and LC in METH-injected mice, indicating that BV-induced peripheral nerve stimulation played an important role in the BV effect. Furthermore, the effects of BV were completely blocked by the α₂-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan (3mg/kg, i.p.), but not by β-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (10mg/kg, i.p.). Taken together, these findings suggest that BV acupuncture into ST36 may modulate METH-induced hyperactivity, hyperthermia and Fos expression through activation of the peripheral nerve and the central α₂-adrenergic activation.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stereoselective pain relieving (antiallodynic) activity, antiallodynic-anticonvulsant correlation, teratogenicity and pharmacokinetic profile of two stereoisomers of valnoctamide (VCD), a CNS-active amide derivative of a chiral isomer of valproic acid (VPA). The individual stereoisomers (diastereomers), (2R,3S)-VCD and (2S,3S)-VCD were synthesized and their antiallodynic activity was evaluated in rats using the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain. The pharmacokinetic profile of the two stereoisomers was evaluated in rats following: 1) i.p. administration of racemic-VCD, 2) i.p. administration of the individual stereoisomers (2R,3S)-VCD and (2S,3S)-VCD. Teratogenicity of racemic-VCD and its two individual stereoisomers was evaluated in a SWV mouse strain known to be highly susceptible to VPA-induced teratogenicity. Racemic-VCD, (2R,3S)-VCD and (2S,3S)-VCD showed a dose-related reversal of tactile allodynia with ED(50) values of 52, 61 and 39 mg/kg, respectively. (2S,3S)-VCD was significantly more potent than (2R,3S)-VCD but the opposite is true for its anticonvulsant-effect. In the teratogenicity evaluation racemic-VCD and its two individual stereoisomers showed mild embryotoxicity at doses 7-10 times higher than their antiallodynic-ED(50) values, while (2S,3S)-VCD was significantly less embryotoxic than (2R,3S)-VCD and racemic-VCD. Following administration of the racemic-VCD there was an increase in the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of (2S,3S)-VCD but not of (2R,3S)-VCD. This study demonstrates that both racemic-VCD and its stereoisomers show high potency as antiallodynic compounds and possess a wide safety margin. (2S,3S)-VCD is more potent and less embryotoxic than (2R,3S)-VCD and thus, has a potential to become a candidate for development as a new drug for treating neuropathic pain.
Two year cancer bioassays conducted by the National Toxicology Program have shown chronic exposure to dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) to lead to the development of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in the hepatic tissue of female Sprague Dawley rats. Most, if not all, of the hepatotoxic effects induced by DLC's are believed to involve the binding and activation of the transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Toxicogenomics was implemented to identify genomic responses that may be contributing to the development of hepatotoxicity in rats.
Through comparative analysis of time-course microarray data, unique hepatic gene expression signatures were identified for the DLCs, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (100 ng/kg/day) and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) (1000 ng/kg/day) and the non-DLC 2,2',4,4',5,5',-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153) (1000 μg/kg/day). A common time independent signature of 41 AhR genomic biomarkers was identified which exhibited at least a 2-fold change in expression following subchronic (13-wk) and chronic (52-wk) p.o. exposure to TCDD and PCB126, but not the non DLC, PCB153. Real time qPCR analysis validated that 30 of these genes also exhibited at least a 2-fold change in hepatic expression at 24 hr following a single exposure to TCDD (5 μg/kg, po). Phenotypic anchoring was conducted which identified forty-six genes that were differently expressed both following chronic p.o. exposure to DLCs and in previously reported studies of cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular adenoma.
Together these analyses provide a comprehensive description of the genomic responses which occur in rat hepatic tissue with exposure to AhR ligands and will help to isolate those genomic responses which are contributing to the hepatotoxicity observed with exposure to DLCs. In addition, the time independent gene expression signature of the AhR ligands may assist in identifying other agents with the potential to elicit dioxin-like hepatotoxic responses.
The effect of hyperprolactinaemia on the prostate has still not been fully elucidated. The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of hyperprolactinaemia on expression of the androgen receptor (AR) in rat epithelial cells of the prostate lateral lobe and on the morphology of these cells. Studies were performed on sexually mature male Wistar rats. To provoke hyperprolactinaemia rats received i.p. metoclopramid (MCP). For light and electron microscopy the lateral lobes were obtained routinely. The intensity of the immunohistochemical reaction of AR (expression of AR) in the epithelial cells of the prostate lateral lobe was assessed by optical density measurements with the help of computer image analysis. Ultrastructural observations of the epithelial cells of the lateral lobe were carried out by means of transmission and scanning electron microscopes. The results showed a more than twofold increase in prolactin (PRL) concentration in the serum, but a twofold decrease in testosterone (T). The intensity of the immunohistochemical reaction of AR in the epithelial cells of the lateral lobe in the experimental group was higher than in the control group. We noted changes in the morphology of the epithelial cells of the prostate lateral lobe in the experimental group.
The authors compared the antimanic effects of clonidine with lithium carbonate in a double-blind crossover design with 24 volunteers. Lithium was observed to be more effective than clonidine. Some patients reported experiencing hypotension (N=8) and depression (N=7) while taking clonidine.
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a genetic syndrome caused by a functional deficit in complement C1 inhibitor that results in recurrent episodes of nonpruritic swelling of the hands, feet, arms, legs, trunk, face, genitalia, bowels, and larynx beginning in childhood or adolescence and continuing throughout the patient's lifetime. Delays in the diagnosis of HAE average several years owing to the rarity of the disorder and the mimicking of clinical symptoms of those of a variety of other diseases. The lives of people with HAE have been transformed in recent years by the approval of several effective new therapies for the treatment and prevention of angioedema attacks. Nonetheless, evidence from surveys shows that many patients still report suboptimal disease control accompanied by significant morbidity, psychological stress, and diminished productivity and quality of life. Further, new HAE agents are costly-the average wholesale price of a single dose of ecallantide (Kalbitor) is $9540-which will further strain an already stressed healthcare system. This article reviews the economic burdens, both direct and indirect, of HAE, and how changes in treatment practices, such as the wider adoption of home-based therapy, may improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.
A large body of compelling preclinical evidence supports the clinical use of neurokinin (NK) receptor antagonists in a plethora of CNS and non-CNS therapeutic areas. The significant investment made in this area over the past 2 decades culminated with the observation that NK(1) receptor antagonists elicited clinical efficacy in major depression disorders. In addition, aprepitant (Merck) was launched as a new drug able to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). After the discovery by GlaxoSmithKline of vestipitant, a wide drug discovery program was launched aimed at identifying additional clinical candidates. New compounds were designed to maximize affinity at the NK(1) receptor binding site while retaining suitable physicochemical characteristics to ensure excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in vivo. Herein we describe the discovery process of a new NK(1) receptor antagonist (casopitant) selected as clinical candidate and progressed into clinical studies to treat major depression disorders.
Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids administered together appear to be complementary in terms of effects on asthma control. The elements of asthma control achieved by LABAs (improved lung function) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs; protection against exacerbations) may be complementary as well.
We sought to determine whether the combination of the LTRA montelukast and the LABA salmeterol could provide an effective therapeutic strategy for asthma.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 192 subjects with moderate asthma, we compared the clinical efficacy of regular treatment over 14 weeks with the combination of montelukast and salmeterol to that with the combination of beclomethasone and salmeterol in moderate asthma. The primary efficacy outcome was time to treatment failure.
Three months after the randomization of the last subject, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board determined that the primary research question had been answered and terminated the trial. The combination of montelukast and salmeterol was inferior to the combination of beclomethasone and salmeterol as judged by protection against asthma treatment failures (p = 0.0008), lung function (26 L/min difference in a.m. peak expiratory flow rate, p = 0.011), asthma control score (0.22 difference in Asthma Control Questionnaire score, p = 0.038), and markers of inflammation and airway reactivity.
Patients with moderate asthma similar to those we studied should not substitute the combination of an LTRA and an LABA for the combination of inhaled corticosteroid and an LABA.
