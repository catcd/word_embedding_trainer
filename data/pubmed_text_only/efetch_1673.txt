To explore the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on the fluidity of hepatic plasma membrane, glutathione concentration in liver, hepatic estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors in pregnant rats with ethinylestradiol and progesterone induced intrahepatic cholestasis.
sixty clean SD pregnant rats were selected and divided into three groups at random. Since the 13th day of pregnancy after taking blood, normal group was injected subcutaneously with refined vegetable oil 2.5 ml x kg(-1) x d(-1). Control group and treatment group were injected subcutaneously with the solution of progesterone 75 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) and 17-alpha-ethynylestradio 1.25 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) till the 17th day. Since the 17th day control group, normal group were fedwish 0.9% natriichloridi solution 5 ml x kg(-1) x d(-1); Treatment group was fedwish UDCA 50 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) every day. On the 21th day, all rats were killed. Then the livers were collected for study. Membrane fluidity was measured by fluorescence polarization using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) as a probe. Glutathione concentration was measured by 5,5'-dithionbis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). Estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors were measured by flow cytometry.
(1) Hepatic plasma membrane fluidity and glutathione (GSH) concentration: significantly lower level of GSH concentration and higher fluorescence polarization (P) were detected in control group (GSH: 1.13 +/- 0.03, P: 0.149 +/- 0.008) in comparison with normal group (GSH: 2.11 +/- 0.07, P: 0.132 +/- 0.004, P < 0.05). However, Significantly higher level of GSH concentration and lower fluorescence polarization were detected in treatment group (GSH: 1.82 +/- 0.04, P: 0.141 +/- 0.006) in comparison with control group (P < 0.05). The level of GSH concentration and fluorescence polarization were no difference between treatment group and normal group. Hepatic estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR): The expression of ER and PR in control group (ER: 89.4 +/- 8.4, PR: 112.3 +/- 11.6) were higher than that of other two groups (P < 0.05). The expression of ER and PR in treatment group (ER: 56.4 +/- 7.5, PR: 70.1 +/- 9.3) were lower than that of control group (P < 0.05). But there was no difference between treatment group and normal group (ER: 39.5 +/- 7.3, PR: 59.6 +/- 7.4; P > 0.05).
Ursodeoxycholic acid may be effective drug in treatment intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
High doses of mequindox (MEQ) are associated with oxidative stress and pathological toxicity in the kidney. In this study, we demonstrated long term effects of MEQ on intra- or extra-adrenal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in vivo. RAAS plays a major role in aldosterone secretion. High doses of MEQ in the diet for 180 days in male rats led to inhibition of intra- and extra-adrenal RAAS, concident with down-regulation of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NAKA) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the downstream of aldosterone action. Significant changes of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in kidney were also observed in the high doses (110, 275mg/kg) groups. The mRNA levels of most subunits of NADPH oxidase were significantly upregulated at low doses (25-110mg/kg) but the upregulation was diminished at higher doses in both kidney and adrenal gland, indicating a complicated and contradictory effect of MEQ on NADPH. These results highlight the complex interactions of drug metabolism, RAAS, NADPH oxidase and oxidative stress in response to MEQ-induced tissue toxicity and aldosterone secretion.
Involvement of histamine H1 receptor in the brains of schizophrenic patients was investigated using 3H-mepyramine as a ligand. The specific 3H-mepyramine binding in the frontal cortex was saturable with the dissociation constant (Kd) of about 0.6 nM and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of 64 fmol/mg protein. Specific H1 antagonists, mepyramine (Ki = 1.4 nM), promethazine (Ki = 1.4 nM), diphenylpyraline (Ki = 4.1 nM), triprolidine (Ki = 5.3 nM), diphenylhydramine (Ki = 35 nM), but not the specific H2 antagonist, cimetidine (Ki greater than 10(5) nM), strongly inhibited the 3H-mepyramine binding. Regional distribution of the specific 3H-mepyramine binding was in the order of: frontal cortex greater than hippocampus greater than cerebellum greater than hypothalamus greater than thalamus, putamen, and pallidum. The specific 3H-mepyramine binding in schizophrenic brains was reduced by 56% in the frontal cortex. Representative Scatchard analyses of the specific 3H-mepyramine binding revealed changes resulting from a decrease in receptor density but not in receptor affinity. Down-regulation of the histamine H1 receptor in the frontal cortex may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
Stress is often mentioned as a factor in the development of drug abuse. Twelve cocaine dependent individuals were administered a stress hormone, cortisol, along with cocaine and saline via intravenous boluses, in a double-blind, counterbalanced fashion. Self-reports of mood states were collected prior to, during, and 20 minutes after each bolus was administered. Cortisol produced significant increases in craving while cocaine significantly elevated all subjective ratings (ie, craving, high, rush, and low). These pilot data suggest that cortisol can induce a state that is associated with drug abuse.
This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of directly observed therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a and once-daily ribavirin (RBV) for chronic hepatitis C in 49 opioid-addicted injection drug users (IDUs) participating in a drug treatment program at a specialized outpatient center. Patients also received prophylactic citalopram to minimize the risk of interferon-induced depression. Patients had daily access to and support from specialist physicians, nurses and counseling services at the center, and a 24-hour helpline. Sustained virological response was achieved by 48 of 49 patients (98%) overall, including 20 of 21 (95%) hepatitis C virus (HCV) Genotype 1/4-infected patients and 28 of 28 (100%) Genotype 2/3-infected patients. Treatment was well tolerated, and no unexpected side effects of peginterferon treatment were seen. The safety profile of once-daily RBV was not different from twice-daily dosing. Decline in hemoglobin levels was similar to those reported in clinical trials including once-daily RBV and did not lead to dose reduction or treatment withdrawal. Our data demonstrate that HCV-infected IDUs on stable L-polamidone (methadone) or buprenorphine maintenance can be successfully and safely treated with peginterferon alfa-2a and RBV in an optimal substitution setting.
Proteinuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate are assuming increased importance in defining cardiovascular risk in chronic renal insufficiency. The aim of this work was to study morphologic, molecular and hemodynamic cardiac alterations in an animal model of proteinuria and renal insufficiency induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN).
Normotensive rats (n = 14) were injected with PAN (150 mg/kg, i.p.) or with vehicle. Blood pressure was measured daily and the animals were placed in metabolic cages for evaluation of urinary excretion of sodium, protein and creatinine. Fourteen days after PAN administration left ventricular hemodynamics were evaluated through a pressure tip micromanometer and heart morphology was examined. Transmural samples of left ventricle were then taken for mRNA quantification of SERCA2a, phospholamban (PLB), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
The animals treated with PAN presented a decrease in creatinine clearance (14th day: 2.24 +/- 0.32 vs. 4.51 +/- 1.08 ml/min) and an increase in proteinuria (14th day: 51.0 +/- 9.0 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.7 mg/mg creatinine), without changes in systolic (14th day: 151 +/- 7 vs. 141 +/- 6 mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure (14th day: 85 +/- 7 vs. 86 +/- 3 mmHg), These alterations were accompanied by cardiac atrophy with decreased left ventricular contractility. A reduction in the SERCA2a/PLB mRNA ratio was observed without significant alteration in the expression of IGF-1 in the left ventricle.
PAN-induced nephropathy is accompanied by cardiac atrophy, left ventricular dysfunction and alterations in the expression of genes involved in myocardial calcium kinetics. These findings were not accompanied by increases in blood pressure and may contribute to our understanding of the increased cardiovascular risk in chronic renal insufficiency.
Maternal exposures to aminopterin and methotrexate have been associated with a pattern of malformation which includes prenatal-onset growth deficiency, severe lack of ossification of the calvarium, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, small, low-set ears, micrognathia, and limb abnormalities. We report on a patient whose mother received methotrexate during the first trimester of pregnancy and who, in addition to the structural anomalies typical of maternal methotrexate exposure, has significant developmental delay. This is the third patient exposed to folic acid antagonists with mental retardation, providing further evidence that developmental delay is one feature of fetal aminopterin-methotrexate syndrome. Therefore, it is recommended that formal developmental testing be performed in all patients prenatally exposed to methotrexate.
Propofol is a popular drug for the induction of anaesthesia and sedation in the intensive care. Previous cases of inadvertent intra-arterial injection propofol injection have had no more than a few hours of hyperaemia. However in this case, residual cutaneous hyperaemia for 12 days were found after intra-arterial injection. This report also highlights the presence of an aberrant radial artery at a site that is used commonly for intravenous cannulation. Early suspicion should be aroused if the patient complains of pain on injection that is not abolished by lignocaine and if blanching of the hand is seen on injection. A useful precaution is establishing a running intravenous line before the administration of drugs. The literature concerning prevention and treatment of inadvertent intra-arterial injection is discussed.
Acute acetaminophen hepatitis was produced in three groups of five rats given 1600 mg/kg by gavage. The protective effect of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, 200 micrograms/kg administered subcutaneously 30 min later, was compared to the protective effect of N-acetylcysteine 1 g/kg similarly administered. All animals were killed at 24 hr, and liver tissues were compared histologically to the damage found in acetaminophen-treated controls and untreated anatomic controls. Serum transaminase values at 24 hr exceeded 1000 units in the acetaminophen control group, averaged 658 units in the acetylcysteine treated group, and were near normal (75 units) in the prostaglandin treated group (P < 0.02). Liver samples (1 cm3) were removed terminally at 24 hr. Liver damage was assessed without reference to precedent history. Histopathologically, damage was most severe in the acetaminophen control group, mainly in pericentral lobular zones. The prostaglandin-treated group showed considerably less damage, which was confined to the hepatic vein area. The acetylcysteine-treated group showed an intermediate degree of damage. We conclude that dmPGE2, given 30 min after ingestion of acetaminophen was found to be more effective in limiting liver damage than NAC in this rat model.
Baclofen is widely used in the treatment of spasticity of spinal origin. It is relatively free of side effects or toxic actions on the nervous system or other organs. Agitation, personality change, and auditory and visual hallucinations have been described following its abrupt withdrawal. One patient with generalized seizures and one with complex partial seizures after baclofen withdrawal have been reported. This paper presents a patient who developed status epilepticus after baclofen withdrawal, and who sustained hypoxic cerebral injury. This observation further emphasizes the possibility of infrequent complications of baclofen therapy, and the advisability of gradual changes in baclofen dosage.
There has been no study for evaluating the associations of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II alleles with toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced asthma in an Asian population.
The aim of this study was to investigate a susceptible or protective marker of HLA class I and II alleles in TDI-induced asthma.
Fifty-five patients with TDI-induced asthma patients (group I) showing positive responses on TDI bronchoprovocation test, 47 asymptomatic exposed subjects (group II) and 95 unexposed healthy nonatopic controls (group III) were enrolled in our study. HLA class I and II genotyping was done by the direct DNA sequencing method.
The allelic frequency of C*09 (15.5%) was significantly higher in group I than in group III (6.8%, P = 0.019), but this statistical significance disappeared after correction was made for multiple comparisons. On two-locus and three-locus haplotype analysis, the allelic frequency of HLA DRB1*15-DPB1*05 in group I (10.6%) was significantly higher than that of group II (0%, P = 0.001) and group III (2.5%, P = 0.003). The allelic frequencies of HLA A*02-DRB1*15, A*02-DQB1*06, B*62-C*09 and A*02-DRB1*15-DQB1*06 were significantly higher in group I (8.5%, 10.3%, 8.2% and 6.8%, respectively) than those allelic frequencies of group III (1.3%, P = 0.002; 1.6%, P = 0.001; 0.6%, P < 0.0001; 0%, P < 0.0001, respectively). The allelic frequencies of HLA DQB1*06-DPB1*05 and DRB1*15-DQB1*06-DPB1*05 were significantly higher in group I (16.0% and 10.5%) than those in group II (2.5%, P = 0.001; 0%, P = 0.001), while the frequencies of DRB1*09-DPB1*05 and DRB1*09-DQB1*0303-DPB1*05 were significantly lower in group I (0% and 0%) than those of group II (7.4%, P = 0.004; 7.5%, P = 0.004). These differences remained statistically significant even after the correction for multiple comparisons.
The HLA haplotype DRB1*15-DPB1*05 can be a susceptibility gene marker for the development of TDI-induced asthma among the exposed workers in the Korean population.
Noradrenaline has been shown to control dopamine turnover and release in rat brain. Noradrenergic lesion with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) decreases dopamine release in the striatum and enhances catalepsy in experimental models of Parkinson's disease. However, in due course, sprouting of remaining noradrenergic axons, to compensate for the decreased noradrenaline is said to occur in specific brain regions. Though this is to some extent understood, the longstanding effects of noradrenergic lesion on dopaminergic neurons of the basal ganglia and in Parkinsonian behavior is not known. Here the question is addressed, whether locus coeruleus lesion with DSP-4 in rats alters dopamine concentration of the basal ganglia and influences Parkinsonian behavior in a long term (6 months). Parkinsonian behavior was assessed by catalepsy and activity cage after challenging with subthreshold dose of haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg), on 7, 30, 90, 120 and 180 days after DSP-4 lesion. The concentrations of noradrenaline and dopamine and its metabolites were estimated by HPLC. 6 months after DSP-4 lesion, increased concentration of noradrenaline was found in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Other regions remain unaffected. The concentration of dopamine remained unchanged. However, dopamine turnover appeared to be increased in prefrontal cortex and reduced in striatum and nucleus accumbens. Catalepsy and hypoactivity were observed in DSP-4 lesioned animals after haloperidol challenge on 7th, 30th and 60th day. Though dopamine turnover was reduced after 6 months in the striatum, haloperidol-induced catalepsy was not observed after 60 days. These results indicate a gradual functional recovery, perhaps hyperinnervation of noradrenergic neurons after DSP-4 treatment and the reversal of its effects on dopaminergic neurons and on Parkinsonian symptoms.
Mental symptoms increased in frequency among 100 patients with parkinsonism treated with levodopa. Dementia was found in about one-third of patients throughout the 6-year treatment period. Thirteen patients became demented during the study, and dementia worsened severely in seven others. Agitated confusion became increasingly frequent and was observed in 60 percent of patients taking levodopa for 6 years. Withdrawal from levodopa decreased agitation, but not dementia. Ten patients received L-tryptophan along with levodopa, but no change in mentation was observed. In view of previous studies of mentation in Parkinson's disease and reports of widespread neuronal changes in the brain of autopsied patients with parkinsonism, our results suggest that the high incidence of dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease who take levodopa reflects prolongation of the course of the illness rather than a direct effect of the medication.
A series of workers with exposure to and respiratory symptoms from toluene diisocyanate (TDI) was compared with a group of exposed, asymptomatic workers and with normal controls using immunologic and clinical evaluations. Improved understanding of TDI-induced respiratory disease may best be achieved by categorizing the symptomatic workers into at least 3 and possibly 4 groups: immunologic TDI asthma; pre-existing chronic respiratory disease exacerbated or unaffected by TDI; asthma coincidental with TDI exposure, and possibly TDI respiratory disease secondary to toxic or inflammatory mechanisms.
We made observations on two patients with asthma and one with COPD who developed steroid-induced myopathy during prolonged treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. On admission, quadriceps force was on the average reduced to 31% of predicted (range 16 to 46% of predicted, nondominant leg), and urinary excretion of creatine in 24 h averaged 687 mg (range 275 to 1,045 mg/24 hr). Respiratory muscle involvement was evidenced by reductions in PImax and PEmax, being 38% (range 36 to 39) and 48% of predicted (range 36 to 68), respectively. Tapering of treatment with corticosteroids resulted in important recovery of quadriceps force and respiratory muscle force. In all three patients, a correlation between muscle forces and steroid dose was present during reduction of the dose. After 6 months quadriceps force averaged 62% of predicted (range 31 to 85), and PImax and PEmax reached 74% (range 52 to 92) and 92% of predicted (range 80 to 106), respectively, after 3 months. Consequently, respiratory muscle force appeared to recover faster than quadriceps force. The implications of these observations for patients treated with the usual doses of corticosteroids for shorter periods require further investigation.
The paper is dealing with the synthesis and properties of new non-targeted or antibody-targeted polymer drug conjugates, bearing doxorubicin (DOX) attached via a spacer susceptible to pH-controlled hydrolysis (hydrazone conjugates), designed as anticancer drugs facilitating site-specific therapy. These conjugates are stable in a pH 7.4 buffer, modeling conditions during transport in the body, but release DOX and activate it inside target cells as a result of pH changes when going from outside to inside the cells. Conjugates containing an antibody directed against T lymphocytes bind effectively and specifically T cell lymphoma EL 4 cells. Cytotoxicity of the hydrazone conjugates is higher than that of classic conjugates, depending on the detailed structure of the polymer, the spacer between the drug and polymer carrier and method of antibody conjugation. Cytotoxicity of some of the conjugates is comparable even with that of the free drug. In both protective and therapeutic regimes of drug administration, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of the conjugates containing DOX was enhanced with long-term survivors (T-cell lymphoma EL 4, C57BL/6 mice) in comparison with much less effective free DOX or a classic P(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide)HPMA-DOX conjugate (already clinically tested).
N-Arachidonoyldopamine (NADA) was recently identified as an endogenous ligand for the vanilloid type 1 receptor (VR1). Further analysis of the bovine striatal extract from which NADA was isolated indicated the existence of substances corresponding in molecular mass to N-oleoyldopamine (OLDA), N-palmitoyldopamine (PALDA), and N-stearoyldopamine (STEARDA). Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis of bovine striatal extracts revealed the existence of OLDA, PALDA, and STEARDA as endogenous compounds in the mammalian brain. PALDA and STEARDA failed to affect calcium influx in VR1-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells or paw withdrawal latencies from a radiant heat source, and there was no evidence of spontaneous pain behavior. By contrast, OLDA induced calcium influx (EC(50) = 36 nm), reduced the latency of paw withdrawal from a radiant heat source in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) = 0.72 microg), and produced nocifensive behavior. These effects were blocked by co-administration of the VR1 antagonist iodo-resiniferatoxin (10 nm for HEK cells and 1 microg/50 micro;l for pain behavior). These findings demonstrate the existence of an endogenous compound in the brain that is similar to capsaicin and NADA in its chemical structure and activity on VR1. Unlike NADA, OLDA was only a weak ligand for rat CB1 receptors; but like NADA, it was recognized by the anandamide membrane transporter while being a poor substrate for fatty-acid amide hydrolase. Analysis of the activity of six additional synthetic and potentially endogenous N-acyldopamine indicated the requirement of a long unsaturated fatty acid chain for an optimal functional interaction with VR1 receptors.
Twenty cases of severe bradycardia, including 12 cases of cardiac asystole, following administration of a single dose of suxamethonium to 17 adult patients are presented. Treatment consisted of i.v. atropine in 16 cases, and in four cases external cardiac massage or a precordial thump was also given. Remission was complete in all cases. The mechanism is not known, but it is suggested that i.v. administration of fentanyl at induction may enhance the tendency to bradycardia following suxamethonium. Absence of preoperative atropine may also be of importance.
Anxiety has been indicated as one of the main symptoms of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome in human addicts and severe anxiety during withdrawal may potentially contribute to relapse. As alterations in noradrenergic transmission in limbic areas underlie withdrawal symptomatology for many drugs of abuse, the present study sought to determine the effect of cocaine withdrawal on beta-adrenergic receptor (beta(1) and beta(2)) expression in the amygdala.
Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days. Two days following the last cocaine injection, amygdala brain regions were micro-dissected and processed for Western blot analysis. Results showed that beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, but not beta(2)-adrenergic receptor expression was significantly increased in amygdala extracts of cocaine-withdrawn animals as compared to controls. This finding motivated further studies aimed at determining whether treatment with betaxolol, a highly selective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, could ameliorate cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety. In these studies, betaxolol (5 mg/kg via i.p. injection) was administered at 24 and then 44 h following the final chronic cocaine administration. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using the elevated plus maze test approximately 2 h following the last betaxolol injection. Following behavioral testing, betaxolol effects on beta(1)-adrenergic receptor protein expression were examined by Western blotting in amygdala extracts from rats undergoing cocaine withdrawal.
Animals treated with betaxolol during cocaine withdrawal exhibited a significant attenuation of anxiety-like behavior characterized by increased time spent in the open arms and increased entries into the open arms compared to animals treated with only saline during cocaine withdrawal. In contrast, betaxolol did not produce anxiolytic-like effects in control animals treated chronically with saline. Furthermore, treatment with betaxolol during early cocaine withdrawal significantly decreased beta(1)-adrenergic receptor protein expression in the amygdala to levels comparable to those of control animals.
The present findings suggest that the anxiolytic-like effect of betaxolol on cocaine-induced anxiety may be related to its effect on amygdalar beta(1)-adrenergic receptors that are up-regulated during early phases of drug withdrawal. These data support the efficacy of betaxolol as a potential effective pharmacotherapy in treating cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety during early phases of abstinence.
Tardive dyskinesia is a serious motor side effect of chronic anti-psychotic therapy. The pathophysiology of this disabling and commonly irreversible movement disorder continues obscure and may be caused due to GABAergic hypofunction or increased oxidative damage and free radical generation. Chronic treatment with typical antipsychotics leads to the development of abnormal hyperkinetic orofacial movements (vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and facial jerking) in rats and is widely accepted as the animal model for tardive dyskinesia. Zolpidem, a GABA-mimetic drug is structurally related to melatonin and has been reported to possess anti-oxidant and neuroprotective effects both in vivo and in vitro. The study was carried out to investigate whether zolpidem can be used in the treatment of typical anti-psychotic-induced orofacial dyskinesia. Chronic haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.p. for 21 days) and chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg, i.p. for 21 days) treatment significantly induced orofacial hyperkinetic movements and zolpidem [N, N, 6-trimethyl-2-p-tolyl-imidazo (1, 2-a) pyridine 3-acetamideL-(+)] dose dependently (1, 2, 5 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) reduced these haloperidol and chlorpromazine-induced hyperkinetic orofacial movements. Biochemical analysis revealed that haloperidol and chlorpromazine treatment significantly induced increase in lipid peroxidation and decrease in the levels of total nitric oxide levels, non-protein thiols (NPSH) and of anti-oxidant defense enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in the striatum of rat brain. Co-administration of zolpidem (1, 2, 5 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and restored the non-protein thiols and total nitric oxide levels induced by chronic haloperidol and chlorpromazine treatment. It also significantly reversed the haloperidol and chlorpromazine-induced decrease in brain SOD and catalase activity. Neurochemical analysis (Neurotransmitter and their metabolite level estimation) revealed that haloperidol and chlorpromazine significantly decreased the dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin levels in brain homogenates where as it caused a significant increase in the metabolite (VMA and HVA) levels in urine, which were significantly reversed by zolpidem at higher doses. Result of the present study support the therapeutic use of zolpidem in the treatment of typical anti-psychotic-induced orofacial dyskinesia.
Cyproterone acetate (CPA) was the first steroidal antiandrogen used for the treatment of prostatic cancer. In recent studies CPA has been linked with DNA adduct formation and increased DNA repair synthesis in vitro, suggesting an increased risk for the development of hepatic malignancies. To assess liver-toxic and carcinogenic effects, 89 patients who received CPA 50 mg/day p.o. over 4 (range 2-152 months) years for prostatic cancer treatment were retrospectively evaluated. 22 patients (28.2%) showed elevated liver enzyme concentrations. In none of the 89 patients alpha-fetoprotein serum levels were elevated. In no case hepatocellular carcinoma has been observed, and in no case CPA administration was discontinued due to side effects. Considering the life expectancy of patients with advanced prostatic cancer and the long-term and high-dose exposure to CPA necessary to possibly induce liver tumors, it appears highly unlikely that CPA treatment may account for a substantial number of liver carcinomas in such patients.
The central nervous system toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized, but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported. A 49-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After he achieved complete remission, he received high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment (2 g/m2 twice a day for 5 days; total, 20 g/m2) as consolidation therapy. The first course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of numbness in his right foot. Electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves. This neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host disease, and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone. Although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear, high-dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.
