To evaluate central and peripheral retinal function in patients treated with vigabatrin, an antiepileptic drug associated with peripheral visual field constriction (VFC).
Six patients with epilepsy treated with vigabatrin as add-on therapy for at least 3 years were included in this observational case series. All patients underwent a clinical ophthalmologic examination, color vision testing, standard perimetry, and full-field and focal foveal cone electroretinography. Four patients, 3 of whom had VFC, completed specialized computerized static light- and dark-adapted perimetry.
In 9 of 11 eyes tested, foveal cone electroretinographic amplitudes were at or below the lower limit of normal. Dark-adapted perimetry demonstrated abnormal rod-derived visual fields in the 3 patients with vigabatrin-attributed VFC, whereas rod-derived thresholds were within normal limits throughout the visual field in the patient who did not have VFC.
Our results suggest that vigabatrin not only impairs peripheral cone-derived function as manifested by VFC but also affects foveal cone electroretinographic amplitudes and rod-derived visual fields. The clinical dilemma regarding the use of vigabatrin therapy is further complicated since central as well as peripheral visual function seems to be adversely affected.
A 49-year-old male with an 8 year history of lowered Hb level, granulocytopenia and fatigue presented in 1986 with progressive fatigue, a dramatically reduced Hb level (45 g/l) and an increased lymphocyte count (6.6 x 10(9)/l). Clinical picture and laboratory studies led to the diagnosis of chronic T lymphocytosis with expansion of CD8+ T cells expressing CD16 IgG Fc receptors (Fc gamma RIII). DNA analyzed with T-cell receptor (TcR) gamma and beta probes revealed extra rearranged bands representing a clonal expansion of T lymphocytes. These T lymphocytes expressed T-cell receptor alpha beta as evaluated by staining with monoclonal antibodies. Because of the severe progressive anemia the patient was transfused with packed red cells. He was then treated with cyclophosphamide. After one month of treatment the transfusions could be discontinued and two months later cyclophosphamide treatment was stopped because of normalized Hb level and lymphocyte counts. The patient remained in a hematologically stable condition, though a minor T-cell population representing the clonal expansion, an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio and low immunoglobulin levels persisted. This is the first report of regression of proven monoclonal CD8+ T gamma-cell expansion and the associated anemia following cyclophosphamide therapy. These observations implicate the expanded monoclonal CD8+ lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of the anemia and granulocytopenia.
We evaluated the clinical effects of intravenously administered secretin in 12 children with autism (age range: 4-6 years, median age: 9 years, boy:girl=8:4). In addition, we investigated the association between improvement in symptoms and changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homovanillic acid (HVA),5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), and 6R-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH(4)) levels after administration. After administration of secretin, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) score improved in 7 of the 12 children. However, the score deteriorated in 2 of the 12 children (in the item of 'restricted and repetitive, stereotyped interests and behaviors'). The HVA and BH(4) levels in CSF were increased in all children with improvement in the ADI-R score. In contrast, no patient without the elevation of the BH(4) level showed improvement in the score. These findings suggest that secretin activated metabolic turnover of dopamine in the central nervous system via BH(4), improving symptoms.
Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe cutaneous drug reaction with a long duration of eruption and serious organ involvement. The mortality rate has been estimated at about 10%. Aromatic anticonvulsants, sulphamides, minocycline and more rarely carbamazepine are the principal responsible drugs. We report the first case of chlorambucil-induced DRESS syndrome in a 70-year-old man recently diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. He developed recurrent skin rash, fever, hypereosinophilia, and acute renal failure after rechallenge with chlorambucil. The condition improved slowly after stopping medication and systemic steroids. Prompt recognition of a chlorambucil drug reaction is essential in patients receiving chemotherapy.
A 62-year-old woman with reported allergies to procaine and lidocaine requested dental care. Consultation with the patient, the patient's physicians, and the patient's dentists did not identify the causes of the adverse reactions had occurred only when anesthetic was administered without vasoconstrictor. There were no reactions when vasoconstrictor was used. Skin testing by an allergist disclosed no evidence of true allergic reaction to any of the 'caine drugs. In addition, no evidence of reaction to preservatives was found during patch testing. The adverse reactions were determined to be caused by an idiosyncratic low threshold to toxic side effects of 'caine drugs. The use of vasoconstrictor (epinephrine) apparently promoted the retention of the anesthetic locally and prevented systemic absorption sufficient to cause the toxic reaction. Practitioners must be aware that adverse reactions to dental anesthetic may be a result of true allergy, psychogenic reaction (syncope), normal toxic overdose, or idiosyncratic toxic overdose.
Fourteen patients aged 1 to 15 years with medulloblastoma (six patients), low-grade astrocytoma (four patients), and high-grade astrocytoma (four patients) were treated with carboplatin and etoposide (JET regimen). Six patients had been treated previously, two of them with cisplatin at conventional doses. Carboplatin was administered at 500 mg/m2/day over 5 h on days 1 and 2, in association with pulsed etoposide at 100 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3. Courses were repeated at 3-week intervals. The disease-specific response rates were as follows: five of six with three complete responses and two partial responses for medulloblastoma; zero of four for low-grade astrocytoma; and two of four with two partial responses for high-grade astrocytoma. Myelosuppression was the main side effect: anemia (hemoglobin less than 8.0 g/dl), thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/microliter) and leukopenia (less than 1,000 white blood cells/microliters) were noted in 19 of 54, 10 of 54, and 7 of 54 courses, respectively. Gastrointestinal toxicity was very mild, and nephro- and neurotoxicity were not observed. No audiometric abnormalities were demonstrated in seven of seven patients who had not previously received cisplatin, and preexisting audiometric abnormalities were not worsened by the administration of carboplatin in one cisplatin-pretreated patient. The combination of carboplatin and etoposide administered in this study appears to be effective and well tolerated in children with brain tumors. Further studies on a larger number of patients are needed to ascertain its real activity in childhood brain tumors.
Thirty-six infants who had an intracranial hemorrhage (diagnosed by cranial ultrasound) within four days after delivery (mean age 2.4 +/- 0.9 (SD) days), were reexamined at three- to seven-day intervals for extension of their intracranial hemorrhage. Seventeen infants had a patent ductus arteriosus and were treated with indomethacin after the initial intracranial hemorrhage was diagnosed. The age for starting indomethacin was 3.8 +/- 1.1 days. Nineteen infants did not have a patent ductus arteriosus and did not receive indomethacin. Both the indomethacin-treated and nontreated groups were similar in birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, gender, incidence of respiratory distress, as well as the location and the degree of hemorrhage in the initial scans. Only one of 17 (6%) infants who received indomethacin v tow of 19 (11%) infants who did not receive it, had extension of their initial intracranial hemorrhage. Although indomethacin may alter platelet function, it does not appear to cause extension of a preexisting intracranial hemorrhage.
An estimated 300 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis C with a prevalence of 0.8%-1.0% of the general population in Canada. An increasing pool of evidence exists supporting the use of pegylated- interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin combination therapy for hepatitis C. We report a 49-year old male of North American aboriginal descent with chronic hepatitis C (genotype 2b). Biopsy confirmed that he had cirrhosis with a 2-wk history of left eye pain and decreased visual acuity. He developed retinal vein thrombosis after 16 of 24 wk of pegIFN-alpha 2a and ribavirin combination therapy. He was urgently referred to a retinal specialist and diagnosed with non-ischemic central retinal vein occlusion of the left eye. PegIFN and ribavirin combination therapy was discontinued and HCV RNA was undetectable after 16 wk of treatment. Hematologic investigations revealed that the patient was a factor V Leiden heterozygote with mildly decreased protein C activity. Our patient had a number of hypercoagulable risk factors, including factor V Leiden heterozygosity, cirrhosis, and hepatitis C that alone would have most likely remained clinically silent. We speculate that in the setting of pegIFN treatment, these risk factors may coalesce and cause the retinal vein thrombosis.
Fernando and Chir 1st reported an association between chorea and oral contraceptives (OCs) in 1966. Differential diagnosis of chorea, in addition to Sydenham chorea, include Wilson disease; encephalitis; Huntington chorea; drug intoxication; benign familial chorea; pregnancy; systemic lupus erythematosus; Henoch-Schonlein purpura; polycythemia vera; hypocalcemia; hyperthyroidism; carbon monoxide poisoning; cerebral infarction, and; intracranial tumor. Chorea can also occur as an untoward side-effect of OC therapy, as shown by the case report of a 20-year old white woman. Chorea associated with OC therapy occur unilateraly but has also been bilateral in 37% of reported cases. 8 of 24 reported cases (33%) had a prior history of rheumatic fever - mean age of patient was 22 years (range, 16 to 40 years). The time between initiation of OC therapy and appearance of choreiform movements can vary from 6 days to 9 months, with a mean of 3 months. Time between discontinuation of OC therapy and cessation of symptoms vary from 3 days to 3 months, with a mean of 5 weeks. Speculations by various authors on the pathogenesis of chorea are described.
The effects of repetitive pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in the hippocampal Na(+)/K(+)ATPase activity were studied in developing rat. Na(+)/K(+)ATPase is a membrane-bound enzyme responsible for the active transport of sodium and potassium ions through the membrane. It is necessary to maintain neuronal excitability. The malfunction of this enzyme has been associated with neuronal hyperexcitability. The pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in developing rats leads to neuronal hyperexcitability and brain damage. We examined the activity of the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase enzyme in hippocampus of rats submitted to 1 episode of status epilepticus on postnatal day 9 and to 3 episodes of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus on postnatal days 7, 8 and 9. Our findings showed that one status epilepticus episode does not modify the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase activity in hippocampus of rats studied 7 or 30 days later (at P16 or P39). However, an increase in the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase activity was detected in hippocampus of rats submitted to three consecutive status epilepticus during the development studied 7 (+142%) and 30 (+400%) days following the injections. In addition, a significant reduction in the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase activity was observed in control rats at P39 compared to P16. Our data suggest that multiple pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in developing rats induce long-lasting increase in the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase activity in the hippocampus, reflecting hyperexcitability.
The wide abuse of the anabolic steroid nandrolone decanoate by athletes and adolescents for enhancement of sporting performance and physical appearance may be associated with testicular toxicity and infertility. On the other hand, taurine; a free β-amino acid with remarkable antioxidant activity, is used in taurine-enriched beverages to boost the muscular power of athletes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of the possible protective effects of taurine on nandrolone decanoate-induced testicular and sperm toxicity in rats. To achieve this aim, male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into four groups and administered either vehicle, nandrolone decanoate (10mg/kg/week, I.M.), taurine (100mg/kg/day, p.o.) or combination of taurine and nandrolone decanoate, for 8 successive weeks. Results of the present study showed that taurine reversed nandrolone decanoate-induced perturbations in sperm characteristics, normalized serum testosterone level, and restored the activities of the key steroidogenic enzymes; 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD. Moreover, taurine prevented nandrolone decanoate-induced testicular toxicity and DNA damage by virtue of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. This was evidenced by taurine-induced modulation of testicular LDH-x activity, redox markers (MDA, NO, GSH contents, and SOD activity), inflammatory indices (TNF-α, ICAM-1 levels, and MMP-9 gene expression), intrinsic apoptotic pathway (cytochrome c gene expression and caspase-3 content), and oxidative DNA damage markers (8-OHdG level and comet assay). In conclusion, at the biochemical and histological levels, taurine attenuated nandrolone decanoate-induced poor sperm quality and testicular toxicity in rats.
This study verifies the effects of bovine brain phosphatidylserine (PS) on passive avoidance (PA) and contextual fear conditioning (CFC) tests in scopolamine-treated mice. Mice received daily i.p. 50 mg/kg PS or 0.2 M Tris pH 7.4 (TRIS) for 5 days. On day 6, mice received saline (TRIS-SAL and PS-SAL) or 1 mg/kg SCO (TRIS-SCO and PS-SCO) i.p. After 20 min, the animals were submitted to PA (experiment 1) or CFC (experiment 2) training sessions, and tests were performed 24 h later. Latency in entering the dark chamber of the PA apparatus presented by TRIS-SCO (but not PS-SCO) group in the test was significantly higher than those presented by controls. Except for TRIS-SCO, all the groups presented higher latencies in the test compared to the training session. In experiment 2, the TRIS-SCO (but not PS-SCO) group presented significantly lower freezing duration than that presented by the TRIS-SAL group in the test. Animals treated with PS alone presented higher freezing duration than that presented by the TRIS-SAL group. The results demonstrate that PS attenuates SCO-induced amnesia in both PA and CFC tests. In addition, PS per se improves retention in the CFC test.
Anecdotal reports suggest that metronidazole may have disease modifying activity in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. To assess possible beneficial effects a double blind, comparative trial of metronidazole and placebo was performed. Fifty patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly allocated to receive active drug (n = 24) or placebo (n = 26) and reviewed at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24. Detailed assessment of drug safety, biochemical and haematological parameters, and efficacy was made at these dates. Dose regimen was 400 mg twice daily from weeks 0 to eight, increasing to 400 mg three times a day from weeks nine to 24 provided that no adverse effects were recorded. Most patients were unable to tolerate metronidazole because of side effects or lack of efficacy, with only five (21%) continuing to take the drug at 24 weeks. For those patients attaining 12 weeks of treatment an overall improvement in articular index and morning stiffness was found. No improvement in laboratory indices of disease activity was seen, however. In this study metronidazole did not have disease modifying properties and was unacceptably toxic.
To describe a case of recurrence of congenital ocular toxoplasmosis with frosted branch angiitis.
A 24-year-old woman presented with hyperemia in her right eye. Medical history included epilepsy at age 14 and mild mental retardation. Iridocyclitis and vitreous opacity were observed in the right eye, and furthermore widespread retinal vessel sheathing due to frosted branch angiitis was seen. Acyclovir was initiated for acute retinal necrosis with frosted branch angiitis. One week later, serologic tests showed elevated toxoplasma antibody level and toxoplasma antibody IgG level, and a white retinal exudative lesion with unclear margins was noted. Therefore, acetylspiramycin and prednisolone were initiated for a recurrence of congenital ocular toxoplasmosis. After treatment, inflammation subsided, the exudative lesion shrank, and the frosted branch angiitis improved.
We encountered a case of ocular toxoplasmosis due to recurrence of congenital toxoplasmosis with frosted branch angiitis. The clinical symptoms of ocular toxoplasmosis can be varied and the diagnosis should be kept in mind.
The cytosolic protein APAF1, human homolog of C. elegans CED-4, participates in the CASPASE 9 (CASP9)-dependent activation of CASP3 in the general apoptotic pathway. We have generated by gene trap a null allele of the murine Apaf1. Homozygous mutants die at embryonic day 16.5. Their phenotype includes severe craniofacial malformations, brain overgrowth, persistence of the interdigital webs, and dramatic alterations of the lens and retina. Homozygous embryonic fibroblasts exhibit reduced response to various apoptotic stimuli. In situ immunodetection shows that the absence of Apaf1 protein prevents the activation of Casp3 in vivo. In agreement with the reported function of CED-4 in C. elegans, this phenotype can be correlated with a defect of apoptosis. Our findings suggest that Apaf1 is essential for Casp3 activation in embryonic brain and is a key regulator of developmental programmed cell death in mammals.
Apoptosis is essential for the precise regulation of cellular homeostasis and development. The role in vivo of Apaf1, a mammalian homolog of C. elegans CED-4, was investigated in gene-targeted Apaf1-/- mice. Apaf1-deficient mice exhibited reduced apoptosis in the brain and striking craniofacial abnormalities with hyperproliferation of neuronal cells. Apaf1-deficient cells were resistant to a variety of apoptotic stimuli, and the processing of Caspases 2, 3, and 8 was impaired. However, both Apaf1-/- thymocytes and activated T lymphocytes were sensitive to Fas-induced killing, showing that Fas-mediated apoptosis in these cells is independent of Apaf1. These data indicate that Apaf1 plays a central role in the common events of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in most death pathways and that this role is critical for normal development.
The case of a myasthenia-like syndrome induced by cardiovascular drugs is reported. The clinical and electrophysiological features of the case are discussed.
The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypoplasia in nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) still remains unclear. Wnt signaling pathways play a critical role in lung development. Whereas canonical Wnt signaling regulates branching morphogenesis during early lung development, the noncanonical Wnt5a controls late lung morphogenesis, including patterning of distal airway and vascular tubulogenesis (alveolarization). Overexpression of Wnt5a in transgenic mice and in the chick has been reported to result in severe pulmonary hypoplasia. We designed this study to test the hypothesis that the pulmonary Wnt5a gene expression is up-regulated in late stages of lung morphogenesis in CDH.
Pregnant rats were exposed to either olive oil or nitrofen on day 9 of gestation (D9). Fetal lungs were harvested on D15, D18, and D21 and divided into 3 groups: control; nitrofen without CDH, CDH(-); and nitrofen with CDH, CDH(+) (n = 8 at each time-point, respectively). Wnt5a pulmonary gene expression was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate Wnt5a protein expression at each time-point.
Pulmonary relative mRNA expression levels of Wnt5a were significantly increased in CDH(-) and CDH(+) at D18 (1.61 +/- 0.92 and 1.81 +/- 1.20, respectively) and D21 (2.40 +/- 0.74* and 2.65 +/- 0.35*, respectively) compared to controls at D18 and D21 (0.90 +/- 0.17* and 1.69 +/- 0.53**, respectively) (*P < .05, **P < .001 vs control ). Strong Wnt5a immunoreactivity was seen in the distal epithelium at D18 and D21 in nitrofen-induced hypoplastic lung compared to controls.
Up-regulation of pulmonary Wnt5a gene expression in the late lung morphogenesis may interfere with patterning of alveolarization, causing pulmonary hypoplasia in the nitrofen-induced CDH.
Mucus hypersecretion in the respiratory tract and goblet cell metaplasia in the airway epithelium contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with airway inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to examine the effect and mechanisms of simvastatin on airway mucus hypersecretion in rats treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Mucus hypersecretion in rat airways was induced by intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. Rats treated with or without LPS were administered intra-peritoneally simvastatin (5 and 20 mg/kg) for 4 days. Expression of Muc5ac, RhoA and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38 in lung were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were assayed by an enzyme-linked lectin assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Simvastatin attenuated LPS-induced goblet cell hyperplasia in bronchial epithelium and Muc5ac hypersecretion at both the gene and protein levels in lung (P <0.05). Moreover, simvastatin inhibited neutrophil accumulation and the increased concentration of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in BALF follows LPS stimulation (P < 0.05). The higher dose of simvastatin was associated with a more significant reduction in Muc5ac mRNA expression, neutrophil accumulation and inflammatory cytokine release. Simultaneously, the increased expression of RhoA and p38 MAPK were observed in LPS-treated lung (P <0.05). Simvastatin inhibited the expression of RhoA and p38 phosphorylation in lung following LPS stimulation (P < 0.05). However, the increased expression of p38 protein in LPS-treated lung was not affected by simvastatin administration.
Simvastatin attenuates airway mucus hypersecretion and pulmonary inflammatory damage induced by LPS. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on airway mucus hypersecretion may be through, at least in part, the suppression of neutrophil accumulation and inflammatory cytokine release via inactivation of RhoA and p38 signaling pathway.
In situ hybridization for c-fos mRNA was performed on brain sections (a) from rats after an acute cocaine-induced seizure or from saline-injected controls and (b) from rats after their first cocaine-kindled seizure, as well as from rats that had not yet developed cocaine-kindled seizures (but were exposed to the same amount of cocaine as those that did exhibit convulsions) and from saline-injected controls. Increased expression of c-fos mRNA was observed in animals demonstrating cocaine-induced seizures acutely or following pharmacological kindling. Rats that experienced acute seizures after cocaine (65 mg/kg) showed pronounced increase in expression of c-fos mRNA in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Increases were also observed in several other limbic cortical regions, as well as the striatum and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH). In rats that were injected daily with an initially subconvulsive dose of cocaine-HCl (40 mg/kg), the cocaine-kindled seizures induced elevations in c-fos mRNA in the same brain regions as with an acute cocaine-induced seizure with the single exception of the VMH. These findings not only suggest the involvement of limbic, cortical and striatal structures in the cocaine-induced seizure, but also raise the possibility that alterations in the proto-oncogene c-fos and its subsequent impact on gene expression could play a role in the changes in neural excitability associated with cocaine-induced kindling.
To determine the relation between QT duration and RR interval on the electrocardiogram, 2 studies were undertaken in 23 young healthy volunteers (mean age 24 years). In study 1, the electrocardiogram (paper speed at 50 mm/s, 800 measurements/subject) was recorded in 11 subjects (5 men, 6 women) at rest, during dynamic exercise and after rapid intravenous injections of isoproterenol (0.2 to 12.8 micrograms), before and after intravenous atropine (2 mg). In study 2, the QT-RR relation was studied at rest and during exercise in 12 subjects (6 men, 6 women) before and after oral propranolol (80 mg). The results confirmed a monoexponential individual relation of the QT and RR intervals during rest and exercise: QT = A-B.Exp (-k.RR). By pooling the RR-QT plots from the 11 subjects in study 1, we found that the measured QT interval = 425-676.Exp (-3.7.10(-3) RR. During isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, QT either did not change or increased and this may indicate an increase in temporal dispersion of ventricular repolarization. Atropine-induced tachycardia produced changes similar to those resulting from exercise testing. Propranolol did not change the QT-RR relation despite a lengthening in RR intervals. These results suggest that physiologic QT-RR adaptation is mainly under parasympathetic control.
The potential for cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2)-selective inhibitors to increase the risk for myocardial infarction is controversial. The Therapeutic Arthritis Research and Gastrointestinal Event Trial (TARGET) aimed to assess gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of the COX2 inhibitor lumiracoxib compared with two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, naproxen and ibuprofen.
18325 patients age 50 years or older with osteoarthritis were randomised to lumiracoxib 400 mg once daily (n=9156), naproxen 500 mg twice daily (4754), or ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily (4415) in two substudies of identical design. Randomisation was stratified for low-dose aspirin use and age. The primary cardiovascular endpoint was the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration endpoint of non-fatal and silent myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Analysis was by intention to treat.
81 (0.44%) patients did not start treatment and 7120 (39%) did not complete the study. At 1-year follow-up, incidence of the primary endpoint was low, both with lumiracoxib (59 events [0.65%]) and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (50 events [0.55%]; hazard ratio 1.14 [95% CI 0.78-1.66], p=0.5074). Incidence of myocardial infarction (clinical and silent) in the overall population in the individual substudies was 0.38% with lumiracoxib (18 events) versus 0.21% with naproxen (ten) and 0.11% with lumiracoxib (five) versus 0.16% with ibuprofen (seven). In the naproxen substudy, rates of myocardial infarction (clinical and silent) did not differ significantly compared with lumiracoxib in the population not taking low-dose aspirin (hazard ratio 2.37 [95% CI 0.74-7.55], p=0.1454), overall (1.77 [0.82-3.84], p=0.1471), and in patients taking aspirin (1.36 [0.47-3.93], p=0.5658). In the ibuprofen substudy, these rates did not differ between lumiracoxib and ibuprofen in the population not taking low-dose aspirin (0.75 [0.20-2.79], p=0.6669), overall (0.66 [0.21-2.09], p=0.4833), and in patients taking aspirin (0.47 [0.04-5.14], p=0.5328).
The primary endpoint, including incidence of myocardial infarction, did not differ between lumiracoxib and either ibuprofen or naproxen, irrespective of aspirin use. This finding suggests that lumiracoxib is an appropriate treatment for patients with osteoarthritis, who are often at high cardiovascular risk and taking low-dose aspirin.
We report the first case of valvular heart disease due to benfluorex. A 50-year-old woman who had been taking the anorectic agent benfluorex intermittently for one year developed severe fibrosis and regurgitation of the mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves. Clinical, echocardiographic and histopathological findings were analogous to those reported with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine. The similarity between the histopathological lesion documented in patients treated with the appetite suppressants fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine and benfluorex and the valvular lesions reported in valve disease associated with ergot alkaloid use and carcinoid heart disease suggest a common pathophysiological mechanism and a central role for serotonin in the development of the disease.
Coronary artery bypass surgery is used widely for treating myocardial ischemia. However, blood flow and flow reserve of normally perfused myocardium subtended by bypass grafts have not been evaluated late after surgery. Also, it is unknown whether pharmacologic vasodilation evokes comparable myocardial flow responses in arterial and venous conduits. Myocardial blood flow was quantified at rest and during dipyridamole hyperemia using N-13 ammonia and positron emission tomography (PET) in 15 patients 9 +/- 3 years after bypass surgery and in 10 healthy volunteers. Blood flow was analyzed in 26 territories subtended by bypass grafts with normal wall motion and normal perfusion. Myocardial blood flow at rest did not differ between patients and controls (0.65 +/- 0.14 vs 0.68 +/- 0.16 ml/ g/min) and was similar in normal myocardium subtended by saphenous vein (n = 16) and internal mammary artery grafts (n = 10; 0.64 +/- 0.13 vs 0.66 +/- 0.15 ml/g/min). However, the hyperemic response in normal myocardium supplied by bypass grafts was less than that in controls (1.61 +/- 0.33 vs 2.04 +/- 0.30 ml/g/min, p <0.005). No differences between territories supplied by venous and arterial conduits were observed (1.61 +/- 0.35 vs 1.63 +/- 0.32 ml/g/min). Normal myocardium subtended by bypass grafts exhibited a lower flow reserve than that in controls (2.54 +/- 0.51 vs 3.16 +/- 0.85, p <0.02). Myocardial flow reserve was almost identical in regions supplied by venous and arterial grafts (2.55 +/- 0.48 vs 2.52 +/- 0.58). The similar reduction in vasodilatory capacity together with the normal PET polar map findings during dipyridamole argue against flow limiting stenoses in both venous and arterial bypass conduits late after revascularization. Rather, nonobstructive proliferative fibrointimal changes of the bypass conduits or atherosclerosis of the native resistance vessels might account for this finding.
We report on two female patients, aged 22 and 50 receiving high-dose theophylline, 750-1,500 mg/day, for bronchial asthma, who were admitted to hospital with severe grand-mal seizures, in one primary focal with secondary generalisation. Extensive neurophysiological and neuroradiological diagnostic evaluation revealed no evidence of cerebral lesions, and there was no history of epilepsy. The probable pathogenesis is the high-dose theophylline, which is known to be neurotoxic, in one case enhanced by additional beta-sympathomimetics.
The use of the new anticancer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has revolutionized the treatment of certain cancers. However, the use of some of these results in cardiotoxicity. Large-scale profiling data recently made available for the binding of 7 of the 9 FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors to a panel of 317 kinases has allowed us to correlate kinase inhibitor binding selectivity scores with TKI-induced damage to neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. The tyrosine kinase selectivity scores, but not the serine-threonine kinase scores, were highly correlated with the myocyte damaging effects of the TKIs. Additionally, we showed that damage to myocytes gave a good rank order correlation with clinical cardiotoxicity. Finally, strength of TKI binding to colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) was highly correlated with myocyte damage, thus possibly implicating this kinase in contributing to TKI-induced cardiotoxicity.
In patients premedicated with scopolamine + morphine (+5 mg nitrazepam the evening before surgery), the sleep-inducing effect of midazolam 0.15 mg/kg i.v. was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone 4.67 mg/kg i.v. Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group, but, although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted longer. On the whole, the differences between midazolam and thiopentone had no apparent clinical consequences. Midazolam is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia.
In this study, the effect of melatonin on sodium arsenite (arsenite)-induced peripheral neurotoxicity was investigated using dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants. After 24-hr incubation, arsenite (30 microm) consistently elevated the expression of heat shock protein 70 and haeme oxygenase-1, two well-known stress proteins, in the treated DRG explants. Co-incubation with melatonin (4 and 20 mm) concentration-dependently attenuated arsenite-induced elevation in stress proteins. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited arsenite-induced phosphorylation of p38 and DNA fragmentation. Inhibition by melatonin of arsenite-induced apoptosis was mediated via inactivating both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial pathways. In the ER pathway, melatonin suppressed arsenite-induced elevation in activating transcription factor-6 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein in the nuclear fraction of the treated DRG explants. Moreover, melatonin attenuated arsenite-induced activation of caspase 12, an ER-specific enzyme. In the mitochondrial pathway, arsenite-induced increases in Bcl-2 levels and cytosolic cytochrome c were reduced by melatonin. At the same time, melatonin inhibited arsenite-induced activation of caspase 3 in the treated DRG explants. Compared with glutathione and N-acetyl cysteine, melatonin was more potent than either in inhibiting arsenite-induced elevation in stress proteins. Taken together, our study demonstrates that melatonin is protective against arsenite-induced neurotoxicity in DRG explants. In addition, melatonin prevented arsenite-induced apoptosis via suppression of ER and mitochondrial activation. Our data suggest that melatonin is potentially a therapy for arsenite-induced peripheral neuropathy.
Identification of biological markers that may predict response to chemotherapy would allow the individualization of treatment by enabling selection of patients most likely to benefit from chemotherapy. The aims of this study were to determine whether p53 mutation status and p53 and p33(ING1b) protein expression can predict which patients with Dukes' C colorectal cancer following curative surgical resection respond to adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
Patients with Dukes'C colorectal cancer (n = 41) were studied. DNA was extracted and analysed for p53 mutation using PCR-based direct DNA sequencing. Tumours were analysed for p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry using DO-7 monoclonal antibody and for p33(ING1b) protein expression using GN1 monoclonal antibody.
There was a significant association between p53 mutation status analysed by gene sequencing and overall and metastasis-free survival (P = 0.03 and 0.004, respectively, log-rank test). By contrast, no significant correlation was found between p53 and p33(ING1b) protein expression and overall or metastasis-free survival.
In patients with Dukes'C colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgical resection of the primary tumour, followed by 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy, p53 mutation status as assessed by gene sequencing is a significant predictor of overall and metastasis-free survival.
