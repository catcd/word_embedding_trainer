Published evidence has linked glutamate with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the up-regulation of a variety of chemokines, including monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)/chemokine ligand 2, with AD-associated pathological changes. In this study, we assessed the potential molecular basis for the role of glutamate in hippocampal inflammation by determining its effects on MCP-1 induction. We also attempted to identify the mechanism by which resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), a polyphenolic phytostilbene, modulates the expression of MCP-1 in the glutamate-stimulated hippocampus. An ex vivo study using rat hippocampal slices demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent increase in MCP-1 release from glutamate-exposed hippocampus. This increase was accompanied by enhanced MCP-1 gene expression via the activation of the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression. The inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway with SL327, which is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, nearly abolished the observed glutamate-induced effects. Furthermore, anti-IL-1beta antibodies suppressed the glutamate-induced expression of MCP-1 mRNA and protein, whereas an isotype-matched antibody exerted only minimal effects. It is worthy of note that resveratrol, to a similar degree as SL327, down-regulated glutamate-induced IL-1beta expression and reduced the expression of MCP-1 mRNA and protein release via the inactivation of ERK1/2. These results indicate that the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and the consequent IL-1beta expression are essential for glutamate-stimulated MCP-1 production in the hippocampus. Additionally, our data reveal an anti-inflammatory mechanism of resveratrol involving the inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway in the hippocampus, which is linked principally to AD-associated cognitive dysfunction.
Previous studies indicated that dacarbazine and Temozolomide could be highly effective against refractory acute leukaemia. Their activity relies mainly on the generation of methyl adducts at the O(6)-position of guanine in DNA. High levels of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) or a defective mismatch repair (MMR) system, are associated with cellular resistance to triazenes. The MGMT inhibitor, O(6)-(4-bromothenyl)guanine (Lomeguatrib), can restore in vitro sensitivity to Temozolomide in MMR-proficient blasts. In the early 1970s we discovered that, in vivo, triazene compounds induce the appearance of novel transplantation antigens in murine leukaemia ("Chemical Xenogenization", CX). Non-self peptides presented by class I MHC molecules are generated by triazene-induced somatic mutations, affecting retroviral sequences that are detectable in the mouse genome. Moreover, preliminary experiments suggested that human cancer cells can also undergo CX. Therefore, we designed a chemo-immunotherapy strategy in leukaemic patients as follows: (a) cytoreduction and a hypothetical CX phase, i.e. treatment with Lomeguatrib (to suppress MGMT activity) and Temozolomide (to kill sensitive blasts and to presumably induce CX in resistant leukaemic cells); (b) immune response recovery phase using interleukin-2 (to possibly restore an immune response and take advantage of the hypothetical, triazene-induced CX). Here we present the results of pilot study which is in progress in patients with refractory/relapsed acute leukaemia. In all tested cases, Lomeguatrib suppressed MGMT activity in vivo. Six out of eight patients showed partial or complete disappearance of blast cells in peripheral blood or in bone marrow. We observed severe and long-lasting myelosuppression, accompanied by limited non-haematological toxicity. Up to now, two patients are alive (after 9 and 10 months, respectively), four died of opportunistic infections and two of progressive disease. This investigation confirms the potential role of triazenes in leukaemia and highlights the contribution of Lomeguatrib in overcoming drug resistance. Further studies are required to establish whether Temozolomide can induce CX in human leukaemia, and thus offer a new approach to control minimal residual disease.
During a large-scale isolation campaign for the heterodimeric phloroglucinyl pyrone arzanol (1a) from Helichrysum italicum subsp. microphyllum, several new phenolics as well as an unusual class of lipids named santinols (5a-c, 6-8) have been characterized. Santinols are angeloylated glycerides characterized by the presence of branched acyl- or keto-acyl chains and represent a hitherto unreported class of plant lipids. The antibacterial activity of arzanol and of a selection of Helichrysum phenolics that includes coumarates, benzofurans, pyrones, and heterodimeric phloroglucinols was evaluated, showing that only the heterodimers showed potent antibacterial action against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. These observations validate the topical use of Helichrysum extracts to prevent wound infections, a practice firmly established in the traditional medicine of the Mediterranean area.
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease is associated with large increases in brain dopamine (DA) levels following drug dosing, but the precise significance of this phenomenon is not understood. Here we compare DA efflux and metabolism in the striatum and the substantia nigra in dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic animals following a standard dose of L-DOPA. Rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions were treated chronically with L-DOPA, monitored on the abnormal involuntary movements scale, and then subjected to intracerebral microdialysis under freely-moving conditions. Following s.c. L-DOPA injection, peak extracellular DA levels in both striatum and substantia nigra were about twice as large in dyskinetic animals compared to non-dyskinetic rats. This effect was not attributable to differences in DOPA levels or DA metabolism. The larger DA efflux in dyskinetic animals was blunted by 5-HT1A/5-HT1B receptor agonists and tetrodotoxin infusion, reflecting release from serotonin neurons. Striatal levels of serotonin and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid were indeed elevated in dyskinetic animals compared to non-dyskinetic rats, indicating a larger serotonergic innervation density in the former group. High DA release was, however, not sufficient to explain dyskinesia. The 'abnormal involuntary movements output' per unit concentration of striatal extracellular DA was indeed much larger in dyskinetic animals compared to non-dyskinetic cases at most time points examined. The present results indicate that both a high DA release post-L-DOPA administration and an increased responsiveness to DA must coexist for a full expression of dyskinesia.
It is well established that psychosis may arise in the context of the abuse of certain prescribed or illicit drugs. Two cases of paranoid psychosis are described in which proprietary preparations containing amphetamine-like drugs were abused. The role of these drugs is discussed with reference to previous case reports, and it is emphasised that initial clinical assessment and urinary screening for drugs may fail to reveal the relevant history with respect to proprietary medicines.
Cancer-related fatigue is an important clinical problem. It is common, distressing, and often difficult to treat. There is a role for drug treatment of cancer-related fatigue, but no consensus has been reached on which drugs are useful. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to review the available evidence and make recommendations for practice and research.
We searched the Cochrane register of controlled trials (through the second quarter 2007), Medline (January 1, 1966, through August 1, 2007), and EMBASE (January 1, 1980, through August 1, 2007) by use of a predetermined list of search terms. Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis review methodology was used for this study. The change in fatigue score on the instrument used in each study and other outcomes of interest (adverse events and withdrawal rates) were compared between treatment and control arms by use of the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided.
We identified 27 eligible trials of drug treatments for cancer-related fatigue (with a total of 6746 participants). The overall effect size for all drug classes was small. A meta-analysis of two studies (n = 264 patients) indicated that methylphenidate (a psychostimulant) was superior to placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD] in change in fatigue score = -0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.54 to -0.05; P = .02) for treating cancer-related fatigue. A meta-analysis of 10 studies (n = 2226 patients) evaluating erythropoietin in anemic cancer patients who were undergoing chemotherapy indicated that erythropoietin was superior to placebo (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI = -0.46 to -0.29; P = .008). Among anemic patients (four studies with n = 964 patients), improvement in fatigue was associated with darbepoetin treatment compared with placebo treatment (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI = -0.27 to 0.00; P = .05). Progestational steroids and paroxetine were no better than placebo in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue.
There is some evidence that treatment of cancer-related fatigue with methylphenidate appears to be effective. More robust evidence indicates that treatment with hematopoietic agents appears to relieve cancer-related fatigue caused by chemotherapy-induced anemia. Further confirmatory trials are required for both observations.
F344 female rats were fed 2,4-diaminoanisole sulfate (2,4-DAA) (a hair dye component) at three concentration levels up to 86 weeks. The administration of hair dye was interrupted after 10 weeks' feeding for 15 animals at the highest concentration level. Both the early effect of 2,4-DAA on the thyroid gland and the late effect on thyroid, mammary, clitoral, and pituitary glands were studied. In a few weeks, 2,4-DAA showed goitrogenic effects on the thyroid gland. However, the nodular phase of the goiter did not develop. Cystic colloid-filled follicles became lined with basophilic flattened epithelium that continued to proliferate and to form adenomatous or papillary neoplasms. Only 10 weeks of feeding at the high level of 2,4-DAA produced a 42% tumor incidence, and one-fourth of the animals had thyroid tumors. Dark pigment in the thyroid epithelium was still present 70 weeks after the feeding of 2,4-DAA had been interrupted. Feeding of high levels of 2,4-DAA for 82 weeks produced a 78% thyroid tumor incidence. Mammary tumor incidence was nearly five times higher at the 0.24% 2,4-DAA feeding level than among controls. At this same feeding level, 45% of the rats had clitoral tumors. Lesions of the pituitary gland were present in all groups, but tumors were encountered only among the 2,4-DAA-fed animals.
Anisocoria after sinus surgery can be related to serious complications such as intraorbital hematoma or increased intracranial pressure secondary to an expanding hematoma.
A 51-year-old man underwent endoscopic surgery of sinuses, and developed anisocoria; likely a result of the local spread of cocaine used to provide local anesthesia and vasoconstriction. The localized effect of this anesthetic agent produced a typical picture of nasociliary ganglion block that subsided in a few hours. In the results, the nasociliary nerve block was noticed on recovery from anesthesia with no other neurologic deficit. Ophthalmologic examination demonstrated a short-lasting anisocoria with loss of accommodation and sensory block over the tip of the nose.
The central spread of the local anesthetics should be considered as a differential diagnosis of unexplained anisocoria, especially when it is associated with loss of corneal reflex.
We sought to quantitate the course of specific cytokine mRNA expression in tissues that exhibit increasing histopathological changes in time in an animal model for the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
The development of treatment protocols for MODS requires elucidation of the mechanisms and mediators involved. To devise logical interventions, it is necessary to collect data on cytokine expression at tissue level during the development of MODS.
Ninety-four C57BL/6 mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 40 microg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by zymosan at a dose of 0.8 mg/g body weight 6 days later (day 0). Six additional animals did not receive zymosan and acted as controls. At several time points after zymosan injection, 6 randomly assigned, zymosan-treated animals were killed, and their livers, lungs, spleens, and kidneys were collected. mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, macrophage migration inhibiting factor, IL-12, interferon-gamma, and IL-10 was measured using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay.
The injection of zymosan induced an acute peritonitis, followed by an apparent recovery. From approximately day 6 onwards, animals started to display MODS-like symptoms. During the peritonitis phase, up-regulation of cytokine mRNA was limited. During the period of apparent recovery, cytokine mRNA expression strongly increased, mostly reaching its maximum at day 9 when deterioration of the clinical condition had already set in. The up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA was most pronounced, especially in the lungs and liver.
Interventions should preferentially be targeted against multiple cytokines and, at least in this model, there may be a treatment window well after the initial challenge.
Although minor and unpleasant side effects have been reported in patients taking ibuprofen, the drug is generally regarded as a safe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. A case is reported of a previously healthy woman who experienced a severe reaction to the drug on two separate occasions.
Imazethapyr, a heterocyclic aromatic amine, is a widely used crop herbicide first registered for use in the United States in 1989. We evaluated cancer incidence among imazethapyr-exposed pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). The AHS is a prospective cohort of 57,311 licensed pesticide applicators in the U.S., enrolled from 1993-1997. Among the 49,398 licensed pesticide applicators eligible for analysis, 20,646 applicators reported use of imazethapyr and 2,907 incident cancers developed through 2004. Imazethapyr exposure was classified by intensity-weighted lifetime exposure days calculated as [years of use x days per year x intensity level]. Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between imazethapyr exposure and cancer incidence. We found significant trends in risk with increasing lifetime exposure for bladder cancer (p for trend 0.01) and colon cancer (p for trend 0.02). Rate ratios (RRs) were increased by 137% for bladder cancer and 78% for colon cancer when the highest exposed were compared to the nonexposed. The excess risk for colon cancer was limited to proximal cancers, (RR = 2.73, 95% confidence intervals 1.42, 5.25, p for trend 0.001). No association was observed for prostate, lung, rectum, kidney, oral, pancreas, lymphohematopoietic cancers or melanoma. These findings provide new evidence that exposure to aromatic amine pesticides may be an overlooked exposure in the etiology of bladder and colon cancer. The use of imazethapyr and other imidazolinone compounds should continue to be evaluated for potential risk to humans.
Resveratrol (RES) is a well-known phytocompound and food component which has antioxidative and multifunctional bioactivities. However, there is limited evidence for the effects of RES on physical fatigue and exercise performance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of trans-RES on fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Male ICR mice from four groups (n = 8 per group) were orally administered RES for 21 days at 0, 25, 50, and 125 mg/kg/day, which were respectively designated the vehicle, RES-25, RES-50, and RES-125 groups. The anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were evaluated using forelimb grip strength, exhaustive swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, and creatine kinase (CK) after a 15-min swimming exercise. The exhaustive swimming time of the RES-25 group (24.72 ± 7.35 min) was significantly (p = 0.0179) longer than that of vehicle group (10.83 ± 1.15 min). A trend analysis revealed that RES treatments increased the grip strength. RES supplementation also produced dose-dependent decreases in serum lactate and ammonia levels and CK activity and also an increase in glucose levels in dose-dependent manners after the 15-min swimming test. The mechanism was related to the increased energy utilization (as blood glucose), and decreased serum levels of lactate, ammonia, and CK. Therefore, RES could be a potential agent with an anti-fatigue pharmacological effect.
Impulsivity is a core symptom of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is a strain commonly used as an animal model of ADHD. However, there is no clear evidence that psychostimulants, which are used for treatment of ADHD, reduce impulsivity in SHR. Because ADHD mainly affects children, it may be relevant to study psychostimulants on juvenile animals.
Using tolerance to delay of reward as index of impulsivity, the effects of methylphenidate were assessed in adult SHR, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar rats and in juvenile Wistar rats.
Animals were trained in a T-maze to choose between a small-but-immediate and a large-but-delayed reward. Adult SHR, WKY and Wistar rats were compared for their ability to tolerate a 15-s delay. The effect of methylphenidate on the tolerance to a 30-s delay was studied in adult rats of the three strains and in juvenile (4.5 to 6.5-week-old) Wistar rats.
In adult rats, the waiting ability was lower in SHR than in control strains. Waiting ability was improved by methylphenidate (3 and 5 mg/kg) in juveniles, but not by methylphenidate (3 mg/kg) in adults.
These data support the idea that SHR are more impulsive than control strains. However, at the dose studied, methylphenidate fails to improve tolerance to delay in adult rats whatever the strain used. The reduction of impulsivity induced by methylphenidate in juvenile Wistar rats indicates that juvenile animals may be suitable for testing the therapeutic potential of drugs intended to the treatment of ADHD in children.
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common illness associated with significant disability. Few large, placebo-controlled trials have been reported.
Outpatients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of moderate-to-severe PTSD were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either sertraline (N = 100) in flexible daily doses in the range of 50 to 200 mg or placebo (N = 108). Primary outcome measures consisted of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-2) total severity score, the patient-rated Impact of Event Scale (IES), and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) ratings.
Mixed-effects analyses found significantly steeper improvement slopes for sertraline compared with placebo on the CAPS-2 (t = 2.96, P =.003), the IES (t = 2.26, P =.02), the CGI-I score (t = 3.62, P<.001), and the CGI-S score (t = 4.40, P<.001). An intent-to-treat end-point analysis found a 60% responder rate for sertraline and a 38% responder rate for placebo (chi(2)(1) = 8.48, P =.004). Sertraline treatment was well tolerated, with a 9% discontinuation rate because of adverse events, compared with 5% for placebo. Adverse events that were significantly more common in subjects given sertraline compared with placebo consisted of insomnia (35% vs 22%), diarrhea (28% vs 11%), nausea (23% vs 11%), fatigue (13% vs 5%), and decreased appetite (12% vs 1%).
The results of the current study suggest that sertraline is a safe, well-tolerated, and significantly effective treatment for PTSD.
Neovascularization in inbred F344 rats during urinary bladder carcinogenesis induced by N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide (FANFT) was examined by scanning electron microscopic observation of vascular casts. FANFT was fed to rats at a level of 0.2% of the diet for 6, 10, or 20 weeks, and vascular casts were examined in these rats at those times and after various times on control diets. Similar foci of vascular proliferation (types I and III) were observed after the use of FANFT as previously reported during bladder carcinogenesis induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine. However, the vascular proliferations were observed to regress as the FANFT-induced epithelial proliferations regressed, similar to the observation of reversible hyperplasias induced by cyclophosphamide or ulceration. Type I vascular foci were present after 6 and 10 weeks, but no vascular lesions were seen through week 20 after these groups of rats were fed the control diet for 4 or more weeks. The epithelial lesions present after 6 and 10 weeks of FANFT feeding also regressed and the mucosa returned to normal as observed by light microscopy. Type III foci were present after 12 weeks and were observed through week 20 when epithelial tumors appeared. Rats fed FANFT for 10 weeks and then the control diet developed hyperplastic epithelial lesions and carcinomas by week 52, whereas those fed FANFT for 6 weeks had normal bladders through 52 weeks.
Hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome (DSS)) is the most common life-threatening complication of dengue. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 2,008 pediatric cases treated for DSS and 2,018 controls from Vietnam. Replication of the most significantly associated markers was carried out in an independent Vietnamese sample of 1,737 cases and 2,934 controls. SNPs at two loci showed genome-wide significant association with DSS. We identified a susceptibility locus at MICB (major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide-related sequence B), which was within the broad MHC region on chromosome 6 but outside the class I and class II HLA loci (rs3132468, P(meta) = 4.41 × 10(-11), per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 1.23-1.46)). We identified associated variants within PLCE1 (phospholipase C, epsilon 1) on chromosome 10 (rs3765524, P(meta) = 3.08 × 10(-10), per-allele OR = 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.86)). We identify two loci associated with susceptibility to DSS in people with dengue, suggesting possible mechanisms for this severe complication of dengue.
Olanzapine is a new atypical antipsychotic agent that belongs to the same chemical class as clozapine. The pharmacological efficacy of olanzapine (in contrast to that of risperidone) has been shown to be comparable to that of clozapine, but olanzapine has the advantage of producing a less pronounced bone marrow depressing effect than clozapine. The specific aims of this study were (a) to assess dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor availability in patients treated with olanzapine by means of iodine-123 iodobenzamide [(123)I]IBZM single-photon emission tomography (SPET), (b) to compare the results with findings of [(123)I]IBZM SPET in patients under treatment with risperidone and (c) to correlate the results with the occurrence of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPMS). Brain SPET scans were performed in 20 schizophrenic patients (DSM III R) at 2 h after i.v. administration of 185 MBq [(123)I]IBZM. Images were acquired using a triple-head gamma camera (Picker Prism 3000 XP). For semiquantitative evaluation of D(2)/D(3) receptor binding, transverse slices corrected for attenuation were used to calculate specific uptake values [STR-BKG]/BKG (STR=striatum; BKG=background). The mean daily dose of olanzapine ranged from 0.05 to 0.6 mg/kg body weight. The dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor binding was reduced in all patients treated with olanzapine. Specific IBZM binding [STR-BKG]/BKG ranged from 0.13 to 0.61 (normal controls >0.95). The decreased D(2)/D(3) receptor availability revealed an exponential dose-response relationship (r=-0.85, P<0.001). The slope of the curve was similar to that of risperidone and considerably higher than that of clozapine as compared with the results of a previously published study. EPMS were observed in only one patient, presenting with the lowest D(2)/D(3) availability. The frequency of EPMS induced by olanzapine (5%) was considerably lower than the frequency under risperidone treatment (40%). Our findings suggest an exponential relationship between the daily dose of olanzapine striatal and decreased D(2)/D(3) striatal binding availability. The results are consistent with the findings of in vitro experiments reporting a higher D(2)/D(3) receptor affinity and a similar 5HT(2) receptor affinity of olanzapine as compared with clozapine. Thus, the decreased tendency to induce EPMS at therapeutic doses is not due to the limited occupancy of striatal D(2)/D(3) receptors in vivo. Patients are protected from EPMS by other intrinsic effects of the drug, i.e. the combination of both D(2)/D(3) and 5HT(2) receptor antagonism.
Previous studies have shown that both a single dose of levodopa and a 1-week administration of levodopa improve visual functions in adult amblyopic patients. In the present study, we investigated the effect of increased dosage and duration of levodopa on amblyopes' visual functions.
Visual acuity and visual fields were examined before and after 3 weeks of daily administration of levodopa/carbidopa as well as 1 month and 2 months after completion of drug therapy in a double masked-design.
A significant increase in visual acuities and a decrease in fixation point scotomas were found. Changes were of comparable dimension to those found after 1 week of levodopa administration. Improvement of visual functions persisted 2 months after the levodopa/carbidopa administration was completed.
The present study confirms previous findings of improvement in visual function in amblyopia after levodopa/carbidopa administration. However, increasing the dosage and the duration of levodopa did not enhance the effect in adults.
Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic commonly used to treat respiratory, urinary tract, skin and soft-tissue infections. Levofloxacin is generally well tolerated and has fewer reported side effects than other fluoroquinolones. We present a case of levofloxacin-associated severe hepatocellular injury. The hepatitis resolved soon after discontinuation of levofloxacin.
The mechanism of action of coronary vasodilation after dipyridamole may be based on inhibition of cellular uptake of circulating endogenous adenosine. Since caffeine has been reported to be a competitive antagonist of adenosine we studied the effect of caffeine on the outcome of dipiridamole-201Tl cardiac imaging in one patient. During caffeine abstinence dipyridamole induced myocardial ischemia with down-slope ST depressions on the ECG, and reversible perfusion defects on the scintigrams. When the test was repeated 1 wk later on similar conditions, but now shortly after infusion of caffeine (4 mg/kg), the ECG showed no, and the scintigrams only slight signs of ischemia. We conclude that when caffeine abstinence is not sufficient, the widespread use of coffee and related products may be responsible for false-negative findings in dipyridamole-201Tl cardiac imaging.
Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is associated with moderale to severe postoperative pain. Although the efficacy of epidural analgesia in this population has been demonstrated, it has not been compared with conventional intravenous (i.v.) analgesia. This prospective study compared the effects of epidural and i.v. morphine regarding postoperative analgesia, side effects, and outcomes in children following SDR.
Twenty-seven children were randomized to receive either epidural or i.v. analgesia. Children in the epidural group had a catheter placed by the neurosurgeon and received preservative-free morphine (Duramorph) 30 microg/kg, followed by an infusion of 3 microg/kg/h for 3 days. Children in the i.v. group received morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg intraoperatively, followed by 0.02 mg/kg doses postoperatively administered by nurses via a patient-controlled analgesia device.
The epidural group experienced lower pain scores (P = .04) and fewer muscle spasms (P < or = .04), and tolerated activity better (P < or = .02) during the early postoperative period than the i.v. group. Side effects were similar between groups, with no respiratory depression in either group. Parents of children in both groups perceived an adequate level of comfort and were very satisfied with the analgesic technique. Additionally, parents believed that their child's postoperative pain was less than anticipated (P < or = .01).
Both techniques provided effective postoperative analgesia with a similar incidence of side effects; however, our findings suggest that continuous infusions of epidural morphine improved overall comfort with lower pain scores, fewer muscle spasms, and improved tolerance of activity during the initial postoperative period.
To evaluate attenuating properties of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on oxidative stress and liver pathology in rats with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (control, n=8) was free accessed to regular dry rat chow (RC) for 6 wk. Group 2 (NASH, n=8) was fed with 100% fat diet for 6 wk. Group 3 (NASH+NAC(20), n=9) was fed with 100% fat diet plus 20 mg/kg per day of NAC orally for 6 wk. All rats were sacrificed to collect blood and liver samples at the end of the study.
The levels of total glutathione (GSH) and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) were increased significantly in the NASH group as compared with the control group (GSH; 2066.7+/-93.2 vs 1337.5+/-31.5 micromol/L and MDA; 209.9+/-43.9 vs 3.8+/-1.7 micromol/g protein, respectively, P<0.05). Liver histopathology from group 2 showed moderate to severe macrovesicular steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and necroinflammation. NAC treatment improved the level of GSH (1394.8+/-81.2 micromol/L, P<0.05), it did not affect MDA (150.1+/-27.0 micromol/g protein), but led to a decrease in fat deposition and necroinflammation.
NAC treatment could attenuate oxidative stress and improve liver histology in rats with NASH.
138 acutely ill schizophrenic patients were treated with oral loxapine succinate for up to 4 weeks in nine studies, all of which shared an identical protocol. These nine, open-label studies were conducted primarily in outpatient settings. For most patients, loxapine, at daily dosages of 30-80 mg, was observed to provide safe, effective, and relatively immediate symptomatic relief and, in most cases, helped to keep acutely ill schizophrenic patients out of the hospital. Side effects, which occurred in 95 patients, were mostly mild and controllable and consisted mainly of extrapyramidal effects.
Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) provide effective immunosuppression after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx), but the associated nephrotoxicity can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among transplant patients. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in OLTx patients with CNI-induced renal impairment.
A chart review was undertaken of all liver transplant recipients followed at the Vancouver General Hospital. Twenty-one (12 male) patients were converted to either MMF monotherapy (n = 18) or MMF with corticosteroids (n = 3) for CNI-induced renal dysfunction. Six were excluded because of other factors contributing to renal dysfunction. Mean time from OLTx to conversion was 11.3 years and mean age was 60. Non-parametric Wilcoxon's signed rank testing was used to determine whether there was a difference between the serum creatinine (SCr) before conversion, and 3 or 6 months after conversion.
Median follow-up was 294 days, ranging from 35 to 1103 days. The median SCr was significantly reduced from 144 micromol/L before conversion to 129 micromol/L and 139 micromol/L at 3 and 6 months follow-up (p = 0.001 and 0.008, respectively). MMF was well tolerated. Only one patient (6.7%) had elevated liver enzymes and required addition of sirolimus while two (13.4%) experienced gastrointestinal intolerance.
MMF appears to be safe for stable OLTx recipients with CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. Serious side effects were uncommon as only one patient required discontinuation of the medication. However, longer follow-up and larger study populations are needed in the future to better determine its efficacy and safety.
We investigated the effects of rosiglitazone on NEFA and triglyceride metabolism in type 2 diabetes.
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of rosiglitazone in diet-treated type 2 diabetic subjects, we measured arteriovenous differences and tissue blood flow in forearm muscle and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, used stable isotope techniques, and analysed gene expression. Responses to a mixed meal containing [1,1,1-(13)C]tripalmitin were assessed.
Rosiglitazone induced insulin sensitisation without altering fasting NEFA concentrations (-6.6%, p=0.16). Postprandial NEFA concentrations were lowered by rosiglitazone compared with placebo (-21%, p=0.04). Adipose tissue NEFA release was not decreased in the fasting state by rosiglitazone treatment (+24%, p=0.17) and was associated with an increased fasting hormone-sensitive lipase rate of action (+118%, p=0.01). Postprandial triglyceride concentrations were decreased by rosiglitazone treatment (-26%, p<0.01) despite unchanged fasting concentrations. Rosiglitazone did not change concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants. Adipose tissue blood flow increased with rosiglitazone (+32%, p=0.03). Postprandial triglyceride [(13)C]palmitic acid concentrations were unchanged, whilst NEFA [(13)C]palmitic acid concentrations were decreased (p=0.04). In muscle, hexokinase II mRNA expression was increased by rosiglitazone (+166%, p=0.001) whilst the expression of genes involved in insulin signalling was unchanged. Adipose tissue expression of FABP4, LPL and FAT/CD36 was increased.
Rosiglitazone decreases postprandial NEFA and triglyceride concentrations. This may represent decreased spillover of NEFAs from adipose tissue depots. Decreased delivery of NEFAs to the liver may lead to lowered postprandial triglyceride concentrations. Upregulation of hexokinase II expression in muscle may contribute to insulin sensitisation by rosiglitazone.
Cancer of the breast is the most common form of malignant disease occurring among women of the western world and environmental substances seem to be involved in the etiology of this disease. Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides and among them parathion, the organophosphorous pesticide used in agriculture to control mosquito plagues. The association between breast cancer and prolonged exposure to estrogens suggests that this hormone also may have a role in such process. However, the causative factors for breast carcinogenesis remain an enigma. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and parathion on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. The results of this study showed that parathion alone and in combination with E2 induced malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F, and the malignant feature was confirmed by anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. Parathion alone efficiently elevated the expression of EGFR, c-Kit, Trio, Rac 3, Rho-A, and mutant p53 proteins. Analysis of gene expression using commercially available human cell cycle array revealed transcriptional alterations in 22 out of a total of 96 genes. Among them, nine genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle were altered. These included cyclins (A1, A2, C, G1, G2, and H), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and minichromosome maintenance deficient (MCM). Results suggest that parathion has the potency to cause malignant transformation of breast epithelial cells through modulation of expression of cell cycle regulated genes.
