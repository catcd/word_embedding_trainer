Antiestrogens of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) type, such as tamoxifen, have two major limitations: their mixed agonist and antagonist profile and the development of tumor resistance. We characterized two new pure antiestrogens-ZK-703 and ZK-253-that belong to the class of specific estrogen receptor destabilizers (SERDs), which includes fulvestrant, and compared their activity with that of fulvestrant and tamoxifen.
Effects of antiestrogens on the growth of estrogen-dependent breast tumors in vivo were determined using several mouse xenograft models (including the tamoxifen-sensitive tumors MCF7, T47D, and MV3366 and the tamoxifen-resistant tumors ZR75-1 and MCF7/TAM) and chemically induced (nitrosomethyl urea [NMU] and dimethylbenzanthracene [DMBA]) rat breast cancer models (groups of 10 animals). We determined the initial response and effects on hormone receptor levels and the time to relapse after treatment (i.e., time to reach a predetermined tumor size threshold). Estrogen receptor (ER) levels were determined by immunoassay.
ZK-703 (administered subcutaneously) and ZK-253 (administered orally) were more effective than tamoxifen or fulvestrant at inhibiting the growth of ER-positive breast cancer in all xenograft models. For example, MCF7 tumors relapsed (i.e., reached the size threshold) in 10 weeks in mice treated with tamoxifen but in 30 weeks in mice treated with ZK-703. ZK-703 and ZK-253 also prevented further tumor progression in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer models to a similar extent (more than 30 weeks in mice with ZR75-1 and MCF7/TAM tumors). In the chemically induced rat breast cancer models, orally administered ZK-703 and ZK-253 caused a nearly complete (>80%) inhibition of tumor growth. ER levels were dramatically reduced in MCF7 tumors after 5 weeks of ZK-703 treatment compared with ER levels in vehicle-treated tumors; by contrast, ER levels in tamoxifen-treated tumors were higher than those in control tumors.
ZK-703 and ZK-253 are potent, long-term inhibitors of growth in both tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer models.
Several studies indicate the pathophysiological importance of reactive oxygen species in rats with nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside, an experimental model of the human minimal change disease. The role of reactive oxygen species in these rats was further evaluated, examining the effect of dietary deficiency and supplementation of antioxidants (vitamin E and selenium) on biochemical and renal ultrastructural alterations induced by puromycin aminonucleoside. Male Wistar rats, weaned at 3 weeks, were placed on diets normal, deficient or supplemented in vitamin E and selenium for 4 weeks. At the end of this period, rats were divided in two groups: control (sacrificed without any further treatment) and nephrotic (injected with puromycin aminonucleoside and sacrificed 7 and 22 days later). In control rats, the dietary deficiency or supplementation of antioxidants resulted in no significative differences in renal function, proteinuria or kidney ultrastructure. However, kidney lipoperoxidation, kidney glutathione peroxidase activity and circulating levels of vitamin E changed according to the amount of antioxidants in the diet. Seven days after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside, rats fed normal, deficient or supplemented diets, developed nephrotic syndrome. However, proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, renal dysfunction and ultrastructural alterations were higher in rats fed a deficient diet. In contrast, proteinuria and kidney ultrastructural alterations were lower in rats fed a supplemented diet. Kidney lipoperoxidation and glutathione peroxidase activity increased on day 7 in rats fed a normal or a deficient diet, but not in rats fed a supplemented diet. This study shows that nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside in rats is modified by dietary antioxidants (vitamin E and selenium). Dietary supplementation ameliorates it and dietary deficiency exacerbates it.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To evaluate renal function during and after hypotensive anesthesia with sevoflurane compared with isoflurane in the clinical setting.
Randomized, prospective study.
Inpatient surgery at Rosai Hospital.
26 ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for orthopedic surgery.
Patients received isoflurane, nitrous oxide (N2O), and fentanyl (Group I = isoflurane group; n = 13) or sevoflurane, N2O, and fentanyl (Group S = sevoflurane group; n = 13). Controlled hypotension was induced with either isoflurane or sevoflurane to maintain mean arterial pressure at 60 mmHg for 120 minutes.
Measurements included serum inorganic fluoride (previously speculated to influence renal function), creatinine clearance (CCr; to assess renal glomerular function), urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG; to assess renal tubular function), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (as clinical renal function indices). Serum fluoride, CCr, and NAG were measured before hypotension, 60 minutes, and 120 minutes after the start of hypotension, 30 minutes after recovery of normotension, and on the first postoperative day. BUN and serum creatinine were measured preoperatively and on the third and seventh postoperative days. Minimum alveolar concentration times hour was 3.6 +/- 1.8 in Group I and 4.0 +/- 0.7 in Group S. In both groups, BUN and serum creatinine did not change, and CCr significantly decreased after the start of hypotension. In Group I, serum fluoride and NAG did not change. In Group S, serum fluoride significantly increased after the start of hypotension compared with prehypotension values and compared with Group I values. In addition, NAG significantly increased at 120 minutes after the start of hypotension and at 30 minutes after recovery of normotension, but returned to prehypotension values on the first postoperative day.
Two hours of hypotensive anesthesia with sevoflurane under 5 L/min total gas flow in patients having no preoperative renal dysfunction transiently increased NAG, which is consistent with a temporary, reversible disturbance of renal tubular function.
Osteopontin is a phosphorylated glycoprotein secreted to the mineralizing extracellular matrix by osteoblasts during bone development. It is believed to facilitate the attachment of osteoblasts and osteoclasts to the extracellular matrix, allowing them to perform their respective functions during osteogenesis. Several other functions have been suggested for this protein, and its up-regulation is associated with various disease states related to calcification, including arterial plaque formation and the formation of kidney stones. Although expression of this gene has been demonstrated in multiple tissues, its regulation is not well understood. Our previous studies on the roles of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and p300/CBP in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation revealed a link between osteopontin induction and the synthesis of alkaline phosphatase. In this paper, we describe results specifically linking induction of osteopontin to the enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase in the medium, which results in the generation of free phosphate. This elevation of free phosphate in the medium is sufficient to signal induction of osteopontin RNA and protein. The strong and specific induction of osteopontin in direct response to increased phosphate levels provides a mechanism to explain how expression of this product is normally regulated in bone and suggests how it may become up-regulated in damaged tissue.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor knockout (TNF-alphaRKO) mice have homozygous deletions of the genes that code for both the 55- and 75-kD receptors. The mice are protected from the fibrogenic effects of bleomycin, silica, and inhaled asbestos. The asbestos-exposed animals exhibit reduced expression of other peptide growth factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, platelet-derived growth factors, and TGF-beta. In normal animals, these and other cytokines are elaborated at high levels during the development of fibroproliferative lung disease, but there is little information available that has allowed investigators to establish the role of the individual growth factors in disease pathogenesis. Here, we show that overexpression of TGF-beta(1) by means of a replication-deficient adenovirus vector induces fibrogenesis in the lungs of the fibrogenic-resistant TNF-alphaRKO mice. The fibrogenic lesions developed in both the KO and background controls within 7 d, and both types of animals exhibited similar incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. Interestingly, airway epithelial cell proliferation appeared to be suppressed, perhaps due to the presence of the TGF-beta(1), a well-known inhibitor of epithelial mitogenesis. Before these experiments, there was no information available that would provide a basis for predicting whether or not TGF-beta(1) expression induces fibroproliferative lung disease in fibrogenic-resistant TNF-alphaRKO mice, an increasingly popular animal model.
Colchicine has been used to control gouty arthritis for long time; colchicine overdose, however, causes multiple organ dysfunction. To date, no investigation has revealed the site of kidney lesion or dysfunction. This investigation describes the case of a male with a history of gout who ingested a large amount of colchicine and developed renal, hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, muscular, electrolytic, and hepatic disorder. Glucosuria was noted during hospital days. Colchicine intoxication is shown to induce proximal tubule damage. Severe electrolytes imbalance was noted, including hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. After management, the renal function and serum electrolyte of the patient recovered on the sixth day of hospitalization.
Pemoline is a central nervous system stimulant used in treating children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Hepatotoxicity has been commonly reported in association with pemoline; however, only two reports of cases of fatal liver failure have been published.
We report on a 14-year-old boy who received concomitant pemoline and methylphenidate in whom fulminant liver failure occurred and for whom liver transplantation failed. Other causes of fulminant liver failure were ruled out, and the liver biopsy was suggestive of drug toxicity. We estimated the probability that these three cases represent an increased risk of fulminant liver failure associated with pemoline.
Based on the three known cases of fatal liver failure associated with pemoline use, we calculated that a child receiving pemoline has a relative risk of development of fulminant liver failure of 45.3 (95% confidence interval, 4.1 to 510). This highly significant association (p < 0.001) suggests causation.
Because pemoline has been widely used in recent years, further studies are needed to better quantify this risk in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.
The objective of the present study is to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of baicalein (BE) on inflammatory cytokines, which is in line with tumor invasion factors and antioxidant defensive system during benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] (50mg/kg body weight) induced pulmonary carcinogenesis in Swiss albino mice. After experimental period, increased levels of total and differential cell count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were observed. Accompanied by marked increase in immature mast cell by toluidine blue staining and mature mast cell by safranin-alcian blue staining in B(a)P-induced lung cancer bearing animals. Protein expression levels studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase were also found to be significantly increased in lung cancer bearing animals. B(a)P-exposed mice lung exhibits activated expression of nuclear transcription factor kappa-B as confirmed by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis. Administration of BE (12 mg/kg body weight) significantly counteracted all the above deleterious changes. Moreover, assessment of tumor invasion factors on protein levels by immunoblot and mRNA expression levels by RT-PCR revealed that BE treatment effectively negates B(a)P-induced upregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cyclo-oxygenase-2. Further analysis of lipid peroxidation markers such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, hydro-peroxides and antioxidants such as glutathione-S-transferase and reduced glutathione in lung tissue was carried out to substantiate the antioxidant effect of BE. The chemotherapeutic effect observed in the present study is attributed to the potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential by BE against pulmonary carcinogenesis.
The ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate mancozeb is a widely used fungicide with low reported toxicity in mammals. In mice, mancozeb induces embryo apoptosis, affects oocyte meiotic spindle morphology and impairs fertilization rate even when used at very low concentrations. We evaluated the toxic effects of mancozeb on the mouse and human ovarian somatic granulosa cells. We examined parameters such as cell morphology, induction of apoptosis, and p53 expression levels. Mouse granulosa cells exposed to mancozeb underwent a time- and dose-dependent modification of their morphology, and acquired the ability to migrate but not to proliferate. The expression level of p53, in terms of mRNA and protein content, decreased significantly in comparison with unexposed cells, but no change in apoptosis was recorded. Toxic effects could be attributed, at least in part, to the presence of ethylenthiourea (ETU), the main mancozeb catabolite, which was found in culture medium. Human granulosa cells also showed dose-dependent morphological changes and reduced p53 expression levels after exposure to mancozeb. Altogether, these results indicate that mancozeb affects the somatic cells of the mammalian ovarian follicles by inducing a premalignant-like status, and that such damage occurs to the same extent in both mouse and human GC. These results further substantiate the concept that mancozeb should be regarded as a reproductive toxicant.
To estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected birth defects.
Population-based, multisite, case-control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major birth defects identified via birth defect surveillance programs in 10 states (n = 13 155) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions (n = 4941).
Reported maternal use of antibacterials (1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester).
Odds ratios (ORs) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders.
The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy, peaking during the third month. Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly (adjusted OR [AOR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.8), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6), coarctation of the aorta (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6), choanal atresia (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.5), transverse limb deficiency (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-5.9), and diaphragmatic hernia (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4). Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1), atrial septal defects (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), and cleft lip with cleft palate (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9). Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included erythromycins (2 defects), penicillins (1 defect), cephalosporins (1 defect), and quinolones (1 defect).
Reassuringly, penicillins, erythromycins, and cephalosporins, although used commonly by pregnant women, were not associated with many birth defects. Sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins were associated with several birth defects, indicating a need for additional scrutiny.
We report a case of pleuro-pericarditis related to administration of isoniazid. Drug-induced lupus is well known; we recall the principle clinical, biological and immunological characteristics.
Defects in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production may be implicated in the high incidence of bacterial infections in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). In the present study, oxygen radical production in patients with ALF due to paracetamol overdose was compared with that of healthy volunteers. Neutrophils from 14 ALF patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with ALF or control serum. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by ALF neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with ALF serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects (P < 0.01). This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used (P < 0.05). Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) from a further 18 ALF patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils. Serum C3 complement levels were significantly reduced in ALF patients compared with control subjects (P < 0.0005). These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in ALF due to paracetamol overdose, that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement, possibly connected to the complement receptor.
The effects of vinorelbine (VRL) on the circadian rhythms in body temperature and locomotor activity were investigated in unrestrained B6D2F1 mice implanted with radio-telemetry transmitters. A single intravenous VRL dose (24 or 12 mg/kg) was given at 7 h after light onset (HALO), a time of high VRL toxicity, and resulted in transient suppression of temperature and activity circadian rhythms in mice kept in light-dark (LD) 12h: 12h. Such suppression was dose-dependent. It occurred within 1-5 d after VRL dosing. Recovery of both rhythms was partially complete within 5 d following the high dose and within 2 or 3 d after the low dose and was not influenced by suppression of photoperiodic synchronization by housing in continuous darkness. Moreover, VRL induced a dose-dependent relative decrease in amplitude and phase shift of the temperature circadian rhythm. The mesor and amplitude of the activity rhythm were markedly reduced following the VRL administration. The relevance of VRL dosing time was studied in mice housed in LD 12h:12h. Vinorelbine was injected weekly (20 mg/kg/injection) for 3 wk at 6 or 18 HALO. Vinorelbine treatment ablated the rest-activity and temperature rhythms 3-6d after each dose, with fewer alterations after VRL dosing at 18 HALO compared to 6 HALO, especially for the body temperature rhythm. There was at least partial recovery 1 wk after dosing, suggesting the weekly schedule of drug treatment is acceptable for therapeutic purposes. Our findings demonstrate that VRL can transiently, yet profoundly, alter circadian clock function. Vinorelbine-induced circadian dysfunction may contribute to the toxicokinetics of this and possibly other anticancer drugs.
Excitotoxic and related inflammatory injury are implicated in the spiral ganglion degeneration seen with Meniere's disease and endolymphatic hydrops (ELH). Excitotoxicity is initiated with glutamate elevation and associated with downstream increases in reactive oxygen species resulting in inflammation-mediated neuronal degeneration. This study tests the hypothesis that interruption of the initial and/or downstream aspects of excitotoxicity should provide hearing protection in ELH-associated hearing loss.
This study tests whether riluzole, a glutamate release inhibitor, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant solvent with favorable properties at the level of glutamate receptors, can protect against early-stage hearing loss in a mouse model of ELH.
The Phex(Hyp-Duk) mouse spontaneously develops ELH and postnatal hearing loss. Starting at postnatal day 6 (P6), daily injections of riluzole + DMSO or just DMSO were administered. Untreated mutants served as controls. At P21, P25, and P30, hearing function was assessed by recording auditory brainstem responses. A cochlear function index was developed to assess global cochlear function at each time point.
Compared to no treatment, DMSO provided significant hearing protection (P < .05). The riluzole + DMSO also showed protection, but it was statistically indistinguishable from DMSO alone; a synergistic increase in protection with riluzole was not observed.
This study demonstrates pharmacological hearing protection in an animal model of ELH. The results support the assertion that inflammatory (reactive oxygen species) injury, which is part of the excitotoxic pathway, contributes to the development of ELH-associated hearing loss.
In this study we evaluated the delayed effects of a calcium entry blocker on blood pressure and on vascular structural and functional alterations in mesenteric resistance arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The calcium entry blocker nitrendipine was administered (30 mg/kg per day) according to three different schedules: in one group of SHR from 4 to 8 weeks of age (n = 12), in a second group from 8 to 12 weeks of age (n = 12), and in a third group from 4 to 12 weeks of age (n = 12). Twelve untreated SHR and 12 untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. Half the animals of each group were killed at 13 weeks, and the remaining were killed at 38 weeks. After death, relative left ventricular mass was calculated. Vascular morphology and function (responses to norepinephrine and acetylcholine) in mesenteric small arteries were then assessed using a micromyographic technique. Nitrendipine treatment delayed the development of hypertension and determined the regression of structural alterations of mesenteric resistance arteries in SHR. These favorable effects were maintained for several weeks after treatment withdrawal, provided that treatment was started at 4 weeks of age. Considering the functional alterations of mesenteric arteries in SHR (responses to norepinephrine and acetylcholine), nitrendipine treatment determined an improvement of both these dysfunctions as long as reductions of the media-to-lumen ratio and blood pressure, respectively, were maintained.
To determine if curcumin has an antiproliferative effect on leiomyoma cells via apoptosis induction and whether curcumin impacts extracellular matrix (ECM) production by assessing the fibronectin expression in leiomyoma cells treated with curcumin.
Tissue culture study of immortalized human leiomyoma and patient-matched myometrial cells treated with curcumin.
University hospital.
Immortalized leiomyoma and myometrial cells from patients with symptomatic leiomyomata.
Tissue culture, followed by proliferation studies, RNA, and protein analysis.
Cell proliferation, alteration in apoptotic signaling pathways.
Curcumin demonstrated an antiproliferative effect on leiomyoma cell lines (IC50 = 20 muM). Importantly, no statistically significant inhibition of growth was observed when patient-matched myometrial cells were exposed to equivalent concentrations of curcumin. Curcumin stimulated caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression while inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK 1), ERK 2, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), suggesting regulation of leiomyocyte apoptosis. Finally, curcumin inhibited expression of fibronectin in leiomyoma cells.
Our findings demonstrate that curcumin inhibited uterine leiomyoma cell proliferation via regulation of the apoptotic pathway, and inhibited production of the ECM component fibronectin. Curcumin provides a novel direction for leiomyoma therapies.
We report a case of anorexigen-associated moderate to severe aortic and mitral regurgitation in which the regression of lesions was marked and well documented over more than 2 years. The stability of our patient, as well as the degree of regression of regurgitation documented in our patient, and others, suggests it is prudent both to observe such patients and to avoid operation until such observation has been carried out.
A 53-year-old postmenopausal woman, who had a family history of cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, was diagnosed with osteoporosis, and started on the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene 60 mg/day orally. She developed marked liver dysfunction. Her body mass index (BMI) was 26.5. Her blood chemistry indicated AST 342 IU/L, ALT 356 IU/L, and hyaluronic acid 255 ng/mL. An oral glucose tolerance test showed impaired glucose tolerance with marked insulin resistance. Histologically, we diagnosed this case as having pre-cirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This is the first histologically confirmed case of NASH that was aggravated by raloxifene.
In rats subcutaneous injection of colchicine resulted in sub-cellular necrosis within the rapidly proliferating cells in the duodenal mucosa. Similar lesions resulted from the administration of cytosine arabinoside hydrochloride and the effects of both drugs were ameliorated by treatment with cycloheximide. It is suggested that these lesions are a form of shrinkage necrosis involved in the deletion of growing stem-cells which, in the absence of mitotic division, results in mucosal atrophy.
Hyperlipidemia and increased serum lipoprotein (Lp)(a) are independent risk factors for atherosclerosis and its complications. Serum Lp(a) concentration is not influenced by most lipid-lowering therapies other than niacin. Recently aspirin also has been reported to decrease its levels. In the current study, we evaluated the serum levels of Lp(a) and lipids in 25 patients with first-ever diagnosed ischemic stroke, aged 21 to 60 years, and compared their levels with an equal number of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. In addition, the effect of aspirin on Lp(a) levels was studied by estimating its levels after 4 weeks of daily treatment with 150 mg of aspirin. Both groups were comparable regarding their anthropometric measurements and routine laboratory parameters except that erythrocyte sedimentation rate was higher in the patients. Serum lipids were not significantly different between the two groups, although Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in the patients (27.40 +/- 22.30 mg/dL) as compared with the control subjects (14.68 +/- 11.75 mg/dL) (P = .005). Twenty of 25 patients (80%) had serum Lp(a) levels of more than 10 mg/dL, whereas only 11 of 25 control subjects (44%) had serum Lp(a) levels of more than 10 mg/dL (P = .009). After 4 weeks of treatment with aspirin, Lp(a) levels declined significantly (46.24%) from baseline 27.40 +/- 22.30 mg/dL to 14.73 +/- 10.47 mg/dL (P < .001). Patients with baseline levels greater than 25 mg/dL showed greater decline (55.63%) compared with those with levels less than 25 mg/dL (26.63%) (P = .008). Results of our study confirm that aspirin lowers the increased Lp(a) levels in patients with ischemic stroke.
Between January 1973 and December 1979, 290 patients with Kawasaki disease were evaluated with coronary angiography after the acute stage of illness. Of these patients, 43 (15 percent) were diagnosed as having coronary aneurysms. Forty-two patients have been followed up for an average of 4 years (range 15 months to 8 years). One 8 month old girl died of myocardial infarction after 4 months of illness. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed in 42 patients 5 to 18 months after the acute illness. Four groups can be distinguished. Group I: In 21 (50 percent) of 42 patients angiography showed that the coronary aneurysms had regressed, so that no observable lesions were seen. During convalescence, electrocardiography, exercise stress testing and thallium scintigraphy were within normal limits. In the other 21 patients abnormal findings persisted on follow-up angiography. Group II: Ten patients showed persistent coronary aneurysms, although reduced in size. Group III: In seven patients the aneurysms had disappeared, but complete obstruction or marked stenosis of coronary arteries was found. Group IV: In four patients, irregularities of the coronary arterial wall without stenosis were seen. Among patients with abnormal angiographic findings myocardial infarction and mitral regurgitation were also seen. Early initiation of aspirin therapy aneurysms show regression on angiography in 1 or 2 years in about half of patients. The remaining patients are at risk for ischemic heart disease. Thus, Kawasaki disease should be considered an important cause of ischemic heart disease in children and a possible risk factor of premature coronary atherosclerosis.
Concurrent abuse of cocaine and heroin is a common problem. Methadone is effective for opioid dependence. The question arises as to whether combining agonist-like or antagonist-like medication for cocaine with methadone for opioid dependence might be efficacious. Two parallel studies were conducted. One examined sustained release d-amphetamine and the other risperidone for cocaine dependence, each in combination with methadone. In total, 240 subjects (120/study) were recruited, who were both cocaine and heroin dependent and not currently receiving medication. All provided consent. Both studies were carried out for 26 weeks, randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled. Study I compared sustained release d-amphetamine (escalating 15-30 or 30-60 mg) and placebo. Study II examined risperidone (2 or 4 mg) and placebo. All subjects underwent methadone induction and were stabilized at 1.1 mg/kg. Subjects attended clinic twice/week, provided urine samples, obtained medication take-home doses for intervening days, and completed self-report measures. Each had one behavioral therapy session/week. In Study I, reduction in cocaine use was significant for the 30/60 mg dose compared to the 15/30 mg and placebo. Opioid use was reduced in all groups with a trend toward greater reduction in the 30/60 mg d-amphetamine group. In Study II, methadone reduced illicit opioid use but cocaine use did not change in the risperidone or placebo groups. There were no adverse medication interactions in either study. The results provide support for the agonist-like (d-amphetamine) model in cocaine dependence treatment but not for antagonist-like (risperidone) treatment. They coincide with our previous reports of amphetamine or risperidone administered singly in cocaine-dependent individuals.
We performed a cross-sectional study in myelomeningocele children.
To investigate plasma total homocysteine, folate, lipid profile, 5,10- metylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotype (MTHFR) and disability.
Sixty patients aged between 2 and 14 years with myelomeningocele (18 ambulatory and 42 non-ambulatory) and 150 healthy children of same age, are investigated for lipid profile, homocysteine concentration and for the determination of MTHFR genotype.
Plasma homocysteine concentrations were significantly higher in myelomeningocele children than in the control group. In myelomeningocele female group, there were higher levels of total cholesterol and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with respect to the control group. Myelomeningocele children walking with tutorial aid showed triglyceride levels significantly lower than those observed in myelomeningocele non-walking children.
Disability, insulin uptake, lipid, homocysteine, hormones plasma levels, and genetic factors such as allelic variants of MTHFR are possible for cardiovascular disease in myelomeningocele children. This study highlights the importance of a continuous surveillance of any changes in the lipid profile that should be corrected as soon as possible. Constant physical activity necessary to increase HDL levels should be planned in all susceptible children. Nonetheless, further investigations are necessary to identify new homocysteine susceptible genes for prevention of early atherosclerosis and consequent cardiovascular disease.
SLO (Smith-Lemli-Opitz) syndrome is an autosomal recessive multiple congenital malformations syndrome, including mental retardation, failure to thrive, craniofacial abnormalities, incomplete development of male genitalia, limb anomalies and various internal organ abnormalities. This syndrome is caused by a deficiency of cholesterol biosynthesis at the distal step of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (7DHCR).
We have reviewed 45 cases of SLO syndrome and showed the large clinical spectrum of this syndrome.
The prenatal diagnosis should be considered when dealing with antenatal growth retardation and visceral malformations. At birth, a normal weight does not systematically exclude the diagnosis. Diagnosis was more difficult for older children especially for girls and should be suspected on the association of mental retardation, autism, short stature and microcephaly. We found a correlation between low plasmatic cholesterol measurement and clinical severity. Phenotype-genotype correlation was difficult to establish. However, homozygosity for IVS8-1G > C splice site mutation was associated with severe phenotype.
Better understanding of the 7DHCR gene regulation factors and of the compensatory mechanism of foeto-maternal cholesterol transfer are necessary to explain the wide clinical spectrum of the SLO syndrome.
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates the beta-amyloid peptide, postulated to participate in the neurotoxicity of Alzheimer's disease. We report that APP and APLP bind to heme oxygenase (HO), an enzyme whose product, bilirubin, is antioxidant and neuroprotective. The binding of APP inhibits HO activity, and APP with mutations linked to the familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) provides substantially greater inhibition of HO activity than wild-type APP. Cortical cultures from transgenic mice expressing Swedish mutant APP have greatly reduced bilirubin levels, establishing that mutant APP inhibits HO activity in vivo. Oxidative neurotoxicity is markedly greater in cerebral cortical cultures from APP Swedish mutant transgenic mice than wild-type cultures. These findings indicate that augmented neurotoxicity caused by APP-HO interactions may contribute to neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease.
