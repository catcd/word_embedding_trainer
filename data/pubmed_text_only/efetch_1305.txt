Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 plays a pivotal role in cell-cycle and cell-fate determination, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) also contributes tumor growth. Recently, interferon (IFN) α has been reported to be effective for prevention of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) recurrence, but the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. In vitro, cobalt chloride-treated VEGF induction and hypoxia responsive element (HRE) promoter activity were inhibited by IFNs and this abrogation was cancelled by introduction of small interfering RNA for STAT1. Immunoprecipitation/chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed STAT1 bound to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and dissociated HIF-complex from HRE promoter lesion. In a xenograft model using Balb/c nude mice, tumor growth was suppressed by IFNα through inhibition of VEGF expression and it was oppositely enhanced when STAT1-deleted cells were injected. This augmentation was due to upregulation of VEGF and hyaluronan synthase 2. In human samples, 29 HCCs were resected, divided into two groups based on STAT1 activation in tumor and the clinical features were investigated. Patients with suppressed STAT1 activity had a shorter recurrence-free survival. Histological and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses showed portal vein microinvasion and increased VEGF levels in tumors from suppressed STAT1 group. These human samples also showed a reverse correlation between VEGF and STAT1-regulated genes expression. These results in vitro and in vivo suggested that IFNα are potential candidates for prevention of vessel invasion acting through inhibition of VEGF expression and need to be properly used when STAT1 expression is suppressed.
To evaluate the efficacy of alcohol in combination with tetracycline for the treatment of symptomatic renal cysts.
Twenty-four patients age 45 to 77 years (mean 66 years) with a large (5-13-cm; mean 7.5-cm) symptomatic renal cyst associated with flank pain were treated by aspiration under ultrasound guidance and injection of alcohol and tetracycline. Patients were followed with ultrasonography at 1, 6, and 12 months and once a year thereafter.
The aspirated volume ranged from 65 to 1500 mL (mean 360.5 mL). Two patients experienced mild pain during alcohol injection, but the procedure was completed successfully. One patient reported severe pain after tetracycline injection. The tetracycline was immediately aspirated, and the procedure was then aborted. The remaining patients were relieved of their symptoms after treatment, and they remained symptom free during a mean follow-up of 20 months (range 7-36 months).
The combination of alcohol and tetracycline is safe and effective and offers a very favorable minimally invasive therapeutic alternative for the treatment of symptomatic renal cysts.
The polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, commonly referred to as dioxin or TCDD, has been shown to cause cleft palate in mice. TCDD displays an interesting interaction with another cleft palate teratogen, retinoic acid (RA): when mice are treated with TCDD and RA simultaneously, palatal clefts can be observed in 100% of offspring of mothers at dose levels far below those required for either agent to produce clefting if given singly. This synergy strongly suggests that the pathways controlled by these agents converge at one or more points in cells of the developing palate. In this study, we examined the effects of TCDD on induction of the type II cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP-II) and the retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR beta) by RA in murine embryonic palate mesenchyme (MEPM) cells. While TCDD alone had no effect on basal levels of expression of either gene, the induction of both genes by RA was strongly inhibited by TCDD. These results represent the first evidence for a direct molecular interaction between the RA and TCDD-mediated signaling pathways.
Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder of early childhood. Genetic factors play an important role in the aetiology of the disorder. In this study, we considered the NRCAM gene as a candidate gene of autism. This gene is expressed in the central nervous system and located in the 7q region, a susceptibility locus of autism. We conducted a case-control study of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the NRCAM gene for possible association with autism in 170 autistic patients and 214 normal controls in a Japanese population. Seven SNPs in the NRCAM gene were significantly associated with autism, among which rs2300045 indicated the most prominent result (p=0.0009 uncorrected, p=0.017 corrected). In haplotype analyses, several individual haplotypes, including a common NRCAM haplotype C-T-T-C-T-T-G-C for rs3763463, rs1859767, rs1034825, rs2300045, rs2300043, rs2300039, rs722519, and rs2216259, showed a significant association after Bonferroni correction (p=0.0035 uncorrected, p=0.028 corrected). These haplotypes were located in the 5' intron-2 region of the gene. In addition, we also assessed the above mentioned SNPs and haplotypes using the transmission disequilibrium test with 148 trios of autistic families. Haplotype G-T-T-T-T-C-G-C in the same eight SNPs was also associated with autism. In summary, our findings provide evidence for a significant association of NRCAM with autism. Considering the important role of the NRCAM gene in brain development, our results therefore indicated that the NRCAM gene is one of the strong candidate genes for autism.
An elderly patient with evidence of atherosclerosis and uremic bleeding diathesis developed two foci of cerebral thrombosis immediately after an infusion of desmopressin (DDAVP). Because large molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) have been demonstrated to cause platelet aggregation under conditions of elevated fluid shear stress as occurs in atherosclerotic vessels, we investigated his plasma vWF at the time of the event and compared it to baseline values obtained 2 weeks later. Unusually large vWF multimers induced by the DDAVP infusion were present and likely contributed to the thrombotic process. Consequently, we believe DDAVP should be given with greater caution to patients with atherosclerosis.
Losartan is a safe, effective long-term treatment for hypertension or posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE) in renal transplant recipients. There were only a few studies in patients without PTE and their results were different. Starting from week 6 and continuing to the week 12 we observed a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels in patients without PTE. Anemia developed in 42.8% of the patients, and Hb levels increased after the withdrawal of losartan treatment. There was a significant decrease in Hct levels beginning from week 3 when compared with the control group. Our study suggests that losartan therapy can decrease Hb beyond its antihypertensive efficacy. Based on the capacity of losartan to decrease Hb and Hct, this drug should be carefully used in patients with preexistent anemia or low Hb levels.
The discovery and structure-activity relationship of a series of hA(2A) receptor antagonists is described. Compound 28 was selected from the series as a potent and selective compound and was shown to be efficacious in an in vivo model of Parkinson's disease. It had acceptable ADME properties; however, the low intrinsic solubility of this compound was limiting for its developability, because the oral bioavailability from dosing in suspension was significantly lower than the oral bioavailability from solution dosage. As a consequence, prodrugs of 28 were prepared with dramatically increased aqueous solubility. The prodrugs efficiently delivered 28 into systemic circulation, with no detectable levels of prodrug in plasma samples. From this investigation, we selected 32 (Lu AA47070), a phosphonooxymethylene prodrug of 28, as a drug candidate.
We have compared two groups (n = 22) of unpremedicated patients to determine if the pain caused by injection of propofol could be modified by alfentanil. In group I, alfentanil 1 mg was given as a bolus i.v. injection 15 s before administration of propofol i.v., while group II received saline. Propofol was given in 20-mg increments every 4 s. All injections were given through the same i.v. cannula on the dorsum of one hand. We found that alfentanil pretreatment reduced pain on injection of propofol (P = 0.001).
Parabenzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) (PBQ) is a bioactve quinone present in cigarette smoke and diesel smoke, which causes severe genotoxic effects both in vitro and in vivo. In the previous study, we showed that the microtubules are one of the major targets of cigarette smoke-induced damage of lung epithelium cells. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of PBQ on cellular microtubules using human type II lung epithelial cells (A549) and also on purified tubulin. Cell viability experiments using A549 cells indicated a very low IC(50) value (approximately 7.5 microM) for PBQ. PBQ inhibited cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis of A549 cells. PBQ also induced the contraction and shrinkage of the A549 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, which is proved to be a direct effect of the damage of the microtubule cytoskeleton network, and that was demonstrated by a immunofluorescence study. PBQ also inhibited the assembly of tubulin in lung cells and a in cell free system (IC(50) approximately 5 microM). Treatment with PBQ resulted in the degradation of tubulin in lung cells without affecting the actin network, and this was confirmed by a Western blot experiment. Upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53 and Bax and downregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 were observed in PBQ-treated A549 cells. Simultaneously, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 were also observed in the PBQ treated lung epithelium cells. Fluorescence and circular dichroism studies demonstrated that the denaturation of tubulin in a cell free system was caused by PBQ. However, in the presence of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), damage of the microtubule network in A549 cells by PBQ was prevented, which led to a significant increase in the viability of A549 cells. These results suggest that microtubule damage is one of the key mechanisms of PBQ induced cytotoxity in lung cells.
We examined whether cardiac sympathetic imaging with iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) would predict improvement of left ventricular (LV) function and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure after treatment with carvedilol.
Eighteen patients with heart failure and 5 control subjects underwent I-123 MIBG imaging. Heart-to-mediastinum ratios at 20 minutes and 3 hours and myocardial washout rates (WR) were measured. Of the 18 patients, 11 were randomized to receive carvedilol medication, whereas the remaining 7 received a placebo. Only the carvedilol group demonstrated a significant improvement in both heart failure functional class and LV ejection fraction (EF) 1 year after the start of medication. Within the carvedilol group, MIBG WR showed a significant inverse correlation with improvement in LVEF (rho = -0.74, P =.02). The diagnostic accuracy of WR for predicting EF response to carvedilol was 91%. WR also appeared to be inversely related to the peak oxygen consumption rate (rho = -0.65, P =.08), although this did not reach statistical significance.
I-123 MIBG imaging appears useful in predicting which patients with heart failure are likely to show the most improvement in LV function and exercise capacity after carvedilol treatment. Further studies in this area appear to be warranted.
We have measured electromyographic (EMG) and systemic arterial pressure (SAP) signals during fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats anaesthetized initially with ketamine 120 mg kg-1 i.p. during controlled ventilation. Fentanyl 100 micrograms kg-1 i.v. induced significant increase in EMG activity, recorded from the sacrococcygeus dorsi lateralis muscle. Power spectral analysis revealed that this was produced by an increase in the root mean square and a decrease in the mean power frequency values of the signals, signifying recruitment and synchronous activation of motor units. Together with transient hypotension and bradycardia, power spectral analysis of the SAP signals demonstrated a reduced but maintained power density of the frequency components that represent respiratory, baroreceptor and vasomotor activities. All these effects were only demonstrated unequivocally in rats maintained by i.v. infusion of ketamine until 10 min before the administration of fentanyl. We conclude that analysis of the temporal alterations in the spectral components of the EMG and SAP signals in rats during mechanical ventilation provides a sensitive method of measuring fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity and the accompanying alterations in haemodynamic variables.
Potassium bromate (KBrO(3)) is a rat renal carcinogen and a major drinking water disinfection by-product in water disinfected with ozone. Clear cell renal tumors, the most common form of human renal epithelial neoplasm, are rare in animals but are inducible by KBrO(3) in F344 rats. Detection of cytoplasmic periodic acid-Schiff-positive granules in clear cell tumors, indicative of glycogen accumulation, provides evidence of their biochemical similarity to human counterparts. Mutation in the coding region of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is frequently detected in human clear cell renal carcinomas. Detection of VHL mutations in KBrO(3)-induced rat renal tumors could enhance the relevancy of these rat renal tumors for human health risk assessment. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded control tissues and renal tumors from male F344 rats exposed to KBrO(3) in the drinking water for 2 years were examined microscopically and were microdissected for DNA extraction. The coding sequence and a promoter region of the VHL gene were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and/or DNA sequencing. Two of nine clear cell renal tumors carried the same C to T mutation at the core region of the Sp1 transcription factor binding motif in the VHL promoter and one of four untreated animals had C to T mutation outside the highly conserved core region. Mutation in the VHL coding sequence was only detected in one tumor. No VHL mutations were observed in three chromophilic tumors. KBrO(3)-induced rat renal tumors are morphologically similar to their human counterpart but the genetic basis of tumorigenesis is different.
A locus segregating with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been mapped to chromosome 21, close to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. Recombinants between the APP gene and the AD locus have been reported which seemed to exclude it as the site of the mutation causing familial AD. But recent genetic analysis of a large number of AD families has demonstrated that the disease is heterogeneous. Families with late-onset AD do not show linkage to chromosome 21 markers. Some families with early-onset AD show linkage to chromosome 21 markers, but some do not. This has led to the suggestion that there is non-allelic genetic heterogeneity even within early onset familial AD. To avoid the problems that heterogeneity poses for genetic analysis, we have examined the cosegregation of AD and markers along the long arm of chromosome 21 in a single family with AD confirmed by autopsy. Here we demonstrate that in this kindred, which shows linkage to chromosome 21 markers, there is a point mutation in the APP gene. This mutation causes an amino-acid substitution (Val----Ile) close to the carboxy terminus of the beta-amyloid peptide. Screening other cases of familial AD revealed a second unrelated family in which this variant occurs. This suggests that some cases of AD could be caused by mutations in the APP gene.
In a preliminary, prospective study, the intensity of extrapyramidal symptoms was rated in four patients receiving intravenous haloperidol and six patients receiving oral haloperidol. The raters were blind to the route of administration. In this pilot study, the first systematic evaluation of intravenous haloperidol and extrapyramidal symptoms, the patients receiving intravenous haloperidol experienced significantly (p less than .01) less intense extrapyramidal symptoms than did the patients receiving oral haloperidol. The literature on intravenous haloperidol is briefly reviewed, and possible explanations of the lower intensity of extrapyramidal symptoms with intravenous haloperidol in the patients studied are discussed.
Working memory is a theoretical concept referring to a set of cognitive processes that provide temporary maintenance and manipulation of the information necessary for complex cognitive tasks. The preponderance of working memory tasks emphasizes the maintenance of information, and, is spatially oriented. Working memory tasks which are not spatially oriented and which require not only the maintenance but also the manipulation of information are needed in order to further our understanding of working memory in animals. The present studies describe a non-spatial, stimulus-comparison procedure for evaluating working memory in rats which may also tap into the central executive component of working memory. The present procedure requires the animals to compare two stimuli (a light and a tone) and, after a delay, respond on one of two levers if the stimuli are the same and on the other lever if the stimuli are different. Thus, the rats must not only remember the stimuli, but must also operate on, i.e. compare, them in order to respond correctly. The rats relatively rapidly acquired the behavior in approximately 30 sessions and did not exhibit a response bias for response location or stimulus type. Moreover, the percent correct responding was dependent on the duration of the retention interval. The muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine, but not by its quaternary analog N-methyl scopolamine, decreased the percentage of correct responding as well as the discriminability of the stimuli as measured by log d while having no effect on bias as measured by log b. The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the present non-spatial, stimulus-comparison procedure may be useful for evaluating working memory in a manner which may involve the central executive component.
The sympathetic-adrenal and kallikrein-kinin systems were studied in 225 patients with various coronary heart diseases before and after therapy with lipoic acid (150 mg/day), tocopherol (100 mg/day), anaprilin (40 mg/day), prodectin (750 mg/day) or their combination. Myocardial and adrenal catecholamine levels were measured in experiments on animals exposed to emotional pain stress. Their levels were found to be affected by lipoic acid, tocopherol, obsidan or their combinations in the same doses, taking into account species specificity. Lipoic acid therapy for patients with coronary heart disease decreased epinephrine excretion, enhanced the elimination of vanillylmandelic acid and norepinephrine. Tocopherol lowered daily urinary epinephrine levels and increased the release of vanillylmandelic acid, without changing epinephrine excretion. Emotional pain stress resulted in myocardial epinephrine accumulation and adrenal norepinephrine in the animals. Lipoic acid prevented this accumulation, whereas tocopherol did not possess this effect.
Phenylazo-naphthol (PAN) allergy induces visibly well-defined and late-appearing hyperpigmentation of brownish yellow guinea pig skin in clear contrast to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) allergy, which has very low incidence of hyperpigmentation. Skin extract from PAN allergy at 20-29 d post-challenge exhibited marked melanogenic stimulatory effects (3H2O release and 14C-thiouracil incorporation) when added to cultured guinea pig melanocytes. The time course in the appearance of melanogenic factor was definitely consistent with the induction pattern of visible pigmentation. By contrast, the addition of DNCB-challenged skin extract demonstrated no significant stimulating effect on melanogenesis in either assay system on any of the post-challenge days tested. Assay of intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formed through incubation with the melanocytes demonstrated that the PAN-allergy skin extract at day 28, which contains definite melanogenic factors, stimulated the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that occurs around 50 seconds in contrast to no or little increase with extracts obtained at days 0 and 1 post-challenge. Gel chromatographic analysis revealed that the PAN-allergy skin extract at day 28 contained a newly generated melanogenic fraction with a molecular weight of approximately 9000 Da which was also capable of stimulating DNA synthesis and activating the signal-transduction process (inositol trisphosphate formation) when added to guinea pig melanocytes. Both stimulations of melanogenesis and DNA synthesis by the 9000 Da fraction were completely abolished by the prior and simultaneous addition of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (H-7) or its down-regulatory agent, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu). Taken together, these results suggest that PAN allergy provides a new mechanism of hypermelanization in which endogenous factors synthesized within skin induce the activation of signal-transduction pathways such as phosphoinositide turnover through ligands-receptor binding, resulting in the stimulation of melanocytes possibly through the activation of PKC.
A rare but well-documented serious adverse reaction to the administration of the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients is the development of medication-induced thrombotic microangiopathy. The recently introduced immunosuppressive medication sirolimus has a very similar molecular structure to tacrolimus and also binds to the same intracellular proteins. Despite these similarities with tacrolimus, sirolimus has a different side-effect profile and reportedly lacks documented specific renal toxicity. This is a case report of the isolated administration of sirolimus without a concomitant calcineurin inhibitor being associated with the development of renal transplant biopsy-proven thrombotic microangiopathy. The patient is a 47-year-old African-American woman whose primary cause of renal failure was not thrombotic micrangiopathy, and she received a 5-antigen mismatched cadaveric renal transplant. Because of preexisting nephrosclerosis in the renal transplant, this patient was never administered a calcineurin inhibitor but was always maintained on sirolimus. With recent animal data showing that sirolmus can be nephrotoxic in a renal ischemic-reperfusion model (similar to what happens with a renal transplant), the authors speculate on a mechanism for this adverse reaction.
In adult patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma, do combination chemotherapy regimens containing ifosfamide have an advantage in terms of response rate, time to progression, or survival, as compared with similar regimens without ifosfamide when used as first-line therapy? What are the adverse effects and effects on quality of life of ifosfamide-containing combination chemotherapy as compared with similar regimens without ifosfamide?
The prognosis for patients with inoperable or meta-static soft-tissue sarcoma (sts) remains grim. Although the surgical resection of pulmonary metastases may be curative in 15%-30% of patients with isolated slow-growing metastases, most patients receive chemotherapy for palliative purposes. Ifosfamide has documented activity in patients who have received prior treatment with, or who have progressed on, doxorubicin. A number of studies have suggested a schedule and a dose-response relationship for ifosfamide in metastatic sts. Ifosfamide has also been assessed in combination with other drugs such as doxorubicin and dacarbazine (dtic); results of such studies have led some authors to suggest that polychemotherapy using "appropriate doses" of ifosfamide and doxorubicin may represent the "most effective systemic treatment" in this population. Given the limited effective therapeutic options available for patients with metastatic sts, the Sarcoma Disease Site Group (dsg) felt that a need existed to more specifically evaluate the potential benefits of ifosfamide-containing combination chemotherapy in that setting. The Sarcoma dsg developed an evidence-based series report through systematic review, evidence synthesis, and input from practitioners across Ontario.
Outcomes of interest included survival, response rate, adverse events, and quality of life.
A systematic review and meta-analysis served as the evidentiary base for this clinical practice guideline. The report was reviewed and approved by the Sarcoma dsg, which comprises medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, methodologists, and patient representatives. The results of an external review by Ontario practitioners, obtained through a mailed survey, were incorporated into this report. Final approval of the evidence-based series report was obtained from the Report Approval Panel of Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence-Based Care (pebc).
The current practice guideline reflects a combination of the draft recommendations (based on the evidence identified in a systematic review and meta-analysis) and the external feedback from Ontario practitioners and the pebc's Report Approval Panel.
In patients with metastatic sts, the addition of ifosfamide to standard first-line doxorubicin-containing regimens is not recommended over single-agent doxorubicin. However, in patients with symptomatic, locally advanced, or inoperable sts, in whom tumour response might potentially result in reduced symptomatology or render a tumour resectable, use of ifosfamide in combination with doxorubicin is reasonable. QUALIFYING STATEMENT: In combination with a doxorubicin-containing regimen, the dose of ifosfamide should not exceed 7.5 g/m(2), given as either a split bolus or a continuous infusion.
To test directly whether fibrin(ogen) is a key binding site for apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] in vessel walls, apo(a) transgenic mice and fibrinogen knockout mice were crossed to generate fibrin(ogen)-deficient apo(a) transgenic mice and control mice. In the vessel wall of apo(a) transgenic mice, fibrin(ogen) deposition was found to be essentially colocalized with focal apo(a) deposition and fatty-streak type atherosclerotic lesions. Fibrinogen deficiency in apo(a) transgenic mice decreased the average accumulation of apo(a) in vessel walls by 78% and the average lesion (fatty streak type) development by 81%. Fibrinogen deficiency in wild-type mice did not significantly reduce lesion development. Our results suggest that fibrin(ogen) provides one of the major sites to which apo(a) binds to the vessel wall and participates in the generation of atherosclerosis.
Autonomic dysfunction occurs in the adult population with irritable bowel syndrome, but this association is not recognized in children. A mother and son with functional abdominal pain unresponsive to conventional treatment had complete resolution of symptoms with treatment directed at the autonomic dysfunction identified by testing. The authors recommend autonomic testing in patients with functional abdominal pain and suggest that autonomic dysfunction plays a direct and intrinsic role in the mechanism of these disorders and their symptoms.
To study the clinical characteristics of ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis in children with renal diseases.
Three children with renal diseases developed biliary pseudolithiasis when they were treated with ceftriaxone. Their clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively analyzed.
Case one was an 11-year-old boy. The initial diagnosis was primary nephrotic syndrome. Ceftriaxone was administered intravenously at a dose of 2 g/d [50 mg/(kg * d)] for gastroenteritis. After that the boy complained of nausea and loss of appetite. Abdominal sonogram obtained on day 3 of ceftriaxone therapy revealed gallbladder sludge. After cessation of ceftriaxone treatment, symptoms and ultrasound abnormalities gradually disappeared, with complete sonographic resolution after 16 days. Case two was a 10-year-old boy. The primary diagnosis was post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis with acute renal failure. The child was treated with 1.5 g/d [30 mg/(kg * d)] intravenous ceftriaxone for gastroenteritis. After that, the boy complained of nausea and abdominal pain with positive Murphy's sign. Gallstone was detected by ultrasonographic examination on day 6 of ceftriaxone therapy. After cessation of ceftriaxone treatment, symptoms and sonographic abnormalities gradually disappeared, with complete sonographic resolution after 18 days. Case three was a 12-year-old boy. The primary diagnosis was nephrotic syndrome. He was treated with 2 g/d [40 mg/(kg.d)] ceftriaxone for gastroenteritis. Gallbladder lithiasis was detected 17 days after the initiation of ceftriaxone therapy (3 days after cessation of ceftriaxone treatment). Gallbladder sonogram was found to be normal two months after the discontinuation of the therapy.
Biliary pseudolithiasis occurred in 3 cases with renal diseases receiving low doses of ceftriaxone. The risk of developing ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis might increase in patients with renal diseases who are treated with ceftriaxone.
Prenatal cocaine exposure has been associated with behavior problems at school age. However, the correspondence between use of cocaine and alcohol during pregnancy is often high, making appropriate allocation of variance and control for other exposures and their interactions difficult. Additionally, gender-specific effects are not typically reported. The purpose of the current study was to determine the degree to which gender-specific effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on teacher-reported child externalizing behavior problems were evident when evaluated in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were singleton infants of mothers who were prospectively evaluated during pregnancy. At age seven, 499 children (214 exposed prenatally to cocaine) were evaluated in our laboratory and teacher reports were solicited. Analyses stratified by gender and prenatal alcohol exposure status, and controlled for significant pre- and postnatal confounders, revealed that among boys with prenatal alcohol exposure, those with persistent cocaine exposure throughout pregnancy had significantly higher levels of Delinquent Behavior compared to boys with no cocaine exposure. Boys with any prenatal cocaine exposure were twice as likely as unexposed boys to have clinically significant Externalizing Behavior scores. However, no association was found between prenatal cocaine exposure and scores on Externalizing Behavior and specific syndromes for boys with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Among girls with no prenatal alcohol exposure, those with persistent cocaine exposure had significantly higher levels of Externalizing Behaviors and Aggressive Behaviors compared to girls with no prenatal cocaine exposure after control for confounding, and were almost five times as likely to have clinically significant Externalizing Behavior scores. However, for girls with prenatal alcohol exposure, no association between prenatal cocaine exposure and scores on Externalizing Behavior and specific syndromes was found after control for confounding. The current findings support gender- and alcohol-moderated effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on school-age teacher-reported child behavior problems. These findings are similar to what we have reported for independent parent-reported behavioral evaluation.
To test the hypothesis that intravascular acid infusion promotes intrapulmonary nitric oxide formation by promoting inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and inhibiting endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in rats.
Prospective, placebo controlled, randomized laboratory study.
University laboratory.
Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 317 +/- 30 g served as study subjects. All animals were anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated throughout the experiment.
The animals were randomized to receive either 0.1 N hydrochloric acid or 0.9% saline intravenously. The infusions were initially given at a rate of 11 mL/kg/hr for 15 mins and then at a rate of 0.95 mL/kg/hr for the remainder of the experiment. Exhaled nitric oxide concentrations and hemodynamic measurements were monitored throughout the experiment. Lung tissues were harvested for Western blot analysis and immunostaining 4 hrs after starting the intravascular infusion.
At the end of the experiment, we found more than a four-fold higher concentration of exhaled nitric oxide in the acid-treated animals than in the saline-treated animals (p <.001). Western blot analysis revealed that the acid infusion increased intrapulmonary iNOS concentrations (p <.001), yet it decreased intrapulmonary eNOS concentrations (p =.009). Acid-related lung injury manifested as a decrease in blood oxygen tensions (p =.045) and as an increase in lung homogenate interleukin-6 concentrations (p =.003).
Our results reveal that hydrochloric acid infusion stimulates intrapulmonary nitric oxide formation at least in part by promoting the expression of iNOS. Our findings suggest that correcting acidosis should attenuate iNOS formation. Our data also support the idea that metabolic acidosis itself can lead to impaired intrapulmonary gas exchange and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6. Whether the induction of intrapulmonary nitric oxide formation mediates or simply indicates lung injury warrants further investigation.
