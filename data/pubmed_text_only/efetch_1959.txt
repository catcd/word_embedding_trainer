The intravenous administration of dimethylethanolamine in the rat promotes a selective enrichment of liver membranes with polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines. The effect of dimethylethanolamine pretreatment on cholestasis induced by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide, a potent cholestatic agent, was assessed in this study. Dimethylethanolamine, dissolved in sodium-taurocholate was infused intravenously (0.3 mg/kg/min) for 15 hr. One group of control rats (estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls) received the bile salt only. An estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide bolus was then injected intravenously (10.4 mg/kg) into dimethylethanolamine-pretreated and estradiol 17 beta-D-control rats, and its effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was compared for 3 hr. The estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide inhibitory effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was significantly antagonized by dimethylethanolamine pretreatment. The maximum inhibition of bile flow was found 30 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration, when it decreased from 3.5 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/100 gm (basal) to 0.9 +/- 0.3 microliters/min/100 gm in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls, whereas in dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats this decreased only from 3.2 +/- 0.4 (basal) to 2.3 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/100 gm. Bile flow and the biliary secretion of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and bile salts were significantly higher in the dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats than in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls (p less than 0.02) during the cholestatic phase. The inhibitory effect of estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide on bile flow was associated with a marked decrease of membrane fluidity (p less than 0.001) assessed by 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy and with a cholesterol enrichment of microsomes, sinusoidal and canalicular liver plasma membranes and inhibition of sinusoidal Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity (p less than 0.05). These membrane alterations persisted 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration despite complete normalization of bile flow. Dimethylethanolamine pretreatment significantly counteracted the reduction of membrane fluidity (p less than 0.001), the cholesterol enrichment and the inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase (p less than 0.05) promoted by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration in all membrane subfractions 30 and 180 min after administration. In addition, dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats had more polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane phosphatidylcholine with respect to the control groups. Dilatation of canaliculi and loss of microvilli were evident in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Unilateral pallidotomy has been effectively used to treat parkinsonism and reduce levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID). We sought to determine the long-term effects of pallidotomy on LID in 10 patients who had initial benefit from pallidotomy but went on to require DBS surgery for symptom progression. The Dyskinesia Rating Scale (DRS) was used to rate and quantify LID in a blinded fashion. Though sample size was small, there was a trend towards a reduction in LID lasting up to 12 years suggesting that posteroventral pallidotomy may provide sustained benefit in reducing LID.
Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) constitute a large, functionally diverse branch of enzymes within the class of NAD(P)(H) dependent oxidoreductases. In humans, over 80 genes have been identified with distinct metabolic roles in carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, retinoid and steroid hormone metabolism, frequently associated with inherited genetic defects. Besides metabolic functions, a subset of atypical SDR proteins appears to play critical roles in adapting to redox status or RNA processing, and thereby controlling metabolic pathways. Here we present an update on the human SDR superfamily and a ligand identification strategy using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) with a focused library of oxidoreductase and metabolic ligands to identify substrate classes and inhibitor chemotypes. This method is applicable to investigate structure-activity relationships of oxidoreductases and ultimately to better understand their physiological roles.
Glucocorticoid-induced hypertension is associated with imbalance between nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide. One of the pathways that causes this imbalance is endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling. In the present study, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)- and dexamethasone-treated rats were further treated with sepiapterin, a precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin, or N-nitro-L-arginine (NOLA), an inhibitor of NOS, to investigate the role of eNOS uncoupling in glucocorticoid-induced hypertension.
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 7-13/group) were treated with either sepiapterin (5 mg/kg/day, IP) or saline (sham) 4 days before and during ACTH (0.2 mg/kg/day, SC), dexamethasone (0.03 mg/kg/day, SC), or saline treatment. NOLA (0.4 mg/ml in drinking water) was given to rats 4 days before and during dexamethasone treatment. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by the tail-cuff method.
Both ACTH (116 +/- 2 to 135 +/- 3 mm Hg (mean +/- s.e.m.), P < 0.001) and dexamethasone (114 +/- 4 to 133 +/- 3 mm Hg, P < 0.0005) increased SBP. Sepiapterin alone did not alter SBP. Sepiapterin did not prevent ACTH- (129 +/- 4 mm Hg, NS) or dexamethasone-induced hypertension (135 +/- 3 mm Hg, NS), although plasma total biopterin concentrations were increased. NOLA increased SBP in rats prior to dexamethasone or saline treatment. NOLA further increased SBP in both saline- (133 +/- 4 to 157 +/- 3 mm Hg, P < 0.05) and dexamethasone-treated rats (135 +/- 5 to 170 +/- 6 mm Hg, P < 0.05). ACTH and dexamethasone increased plasma F(2)-isoprostane concentrations. Neither sepiapterin nor NOLA significantly affected this marker of oxidative stress.
Sepiapterin did not prevent ACTH- or dexamethasone-induced hypertension. NOLA exacerbated dexamethasone-induced hypertension. These data suggest that eNOS uncoupling does not play a major role in the genesis of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in the rat.
The concurrence of prenatal alcohol exposure with other drug exposure, low socioeconomic status and environmental risk factors may obscure associations, if any, between prenatal cocaine exposure and child outcomes. This study evaluates the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on child behavior in analyses stratified by gender and prenatal alcohol exposure status.
Maternal alcohol, cigarette, and illicit drug use were prospectively assessed by interview during pregnancy and postnatally. Maternal and neonatal urine were tested for drug exposure as clinically indicated. Caregiver report of child behavior was assessed with the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Dichotomous cocaine exposure was characterized as no (negative history and biologic markers), and any (positive history and/or biologic markers during pregnancy and/or positive urine screen at delivery from either mother or infant).
Prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with adverse effects on offspring behavior that were moderated by the gender of the offspring as well as prenatal alcohol exposure. For girls without prenatal alcohol exposure, 6.5% of the unique variance in behavior was related to prenatal cocaine exposure. For these girls, the odds of scoring in the abnormal range for Aggression was 17 times control levels (95% confidence limits 1.4 to 203). These findings, though significant, have wide confidence intervals and need to be replicated in larger cohorts and on longitudinal follow-up.
Familial tumoral calcinosis is characterized by ectopic calcifications and hyperphosphatemia due to inactivating mutations in FGF23 or UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3). Herein we report a homozygous missense mutation (H193R) in the KLOTHO (KL) gene of a 13-year-old girl who presented with severe tumoral calcinosis with dural and carotid artery calcifications. This patient exhibited defects in mineral ion homeostasis with marked hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia as well as elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone and FGF23. Mapping of H193R mutation onto the crystal structure of myrosinase, a plant homolog of KL, revealed that this histidine residue was at the base of the deep catalytic cleft and mutation of this histidine to arginine should destabilize the putative glycosidase domain (KL1) of KL, thereby attenuating production of membrane-bound and secreted KL. Indeed, compared with wild-type KL, expression and secretion of H193R KL were markedly reduced in vitro, resulting in diminished ability of FGF23 to signal via its cognate FGF receptors. Taken together, our findings provide what we believe to be the first evidence that loss-of-function mutations in human KL impair FGF23 bioactivity, underscoring the essential role of KL in FGF23-mediated phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis in humans.
In a previous screening work, Foeniculum vulgare essential oil emerged from a pool of 24 essential oils for its antiplatelet properties and its ability to destabilize the retraction of the coagulum. In the present work the main component of the oil, anethole, tested in guinea pig plasma was as potent as fennel oil in inhibiting arachidonic acid-, collagen-, ADP- and U46619-induced aggregation (IC(50) from 4 to 147 microg ml(-1)). It also prevented thrombin-induced clot retraction at concentrations similar to fennel oil. The essential oil and anethole, tested in rat aorta with or without endothelium, displayed comparable NO-independent vasorelaxant activity at antiplatelet concentrations which have been proved to be free from cytotoxic effects in vitro. In vivo, both F. vulgare essential oil and anethole orally administered in a subacute treatment to mice (30 mg kg(-1)day(-1) for 5 days) showed significant antithrombotic activity preventing the paralysis induced by collagen-epinephrine intravenous injection (70% and 83% protection, respectively). At the antithrombotic dosage they were free from prohemorrhagic side effect at variance with acetylsalicylic acid used as reference drug. Furthermore, both F. vulgare essential oil and anethole (100 mg kg(-1) oral administration) provided significant protection toward ethanol induced gastric lesions in rats. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for F. vulgare essential oil, and its main component anethole, a safe antithrombotic activity that seems due to their broad spectrum antiplatelet activity, clot destabilizing effect and vasorelaxant action.
Corticosterone, the main glucorticoid hormone in rodents, facilitates behavioral responses to cocaine. Corticosterone is proposed to modulate cocaine intravenous self-administration (SA) and cocaine-induced locomotion through distinct receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), respectively. However, this remains debatable. On one hand, modulation of both responses by the GR was tested in different experimental conditions, i.e. light versus dark nycthemeral phase and naïve versus cocaine-experienced animals. On the other hand, modulation of both responses by the MR was never tested directly but only inferred based on the ability of low plasma corticosterone levels (those for which corticosterone almost exclusively binds the MR) to compensate the effects of adrenalectomy. Our goal here was to test the involvement of the GR and the MR in cocaine-induced locomotor and reinforcing effects in the same experimental conditions. C57Bl/6J mice were trained for cocaine (1 mg/kg/infusion) intravenous SA over 40 SA sessions. The animals were then administered with mifepristone (30 mg/kg i.p.), a GR antagonist, or with spironolactone (20 mg/kg/i.p.), an MR antagonist, 2 hours before either cocaine intravenous SA or cocaine-induced locomotion. In a comparable nycthemeral period and in similarly cocaine-experienced animals, a blockade of the GR decreased cocaine-induced reinforcing effects but not cocaine-induced locomotion. A blockade of the MR decreased both cocaine-induced reinforcing (but to a much lesser extent than the GR blockade) and locomotor effects. Altogether, our results comforted the hypothesis that the GR modulates cocaine-related operant conditioning, while the MR would modulate cocaine-related unconditioned effects. The present data also reveal mifepristone as an interesting tool for manipulating the impact of corticosterone on cocaine-induced reinforcing effects in mice.
Prospective clinical and electrophysiological follow-up was performed on nine patients under thalidomide treatment in order to detect the very beginning of possible drug-induced peripheral neuropathy. For neurophysiological assessment, nerve conduction measurements of the median, peroneal and sural nerves (7 conduction parameters) and needle EMG examination of the anterior tibial muscle were performed. The results of a first control after about 3 months of treatment were compared with the starting point examination, and the patients were then classified as "affected" or "not affected" according to clinical and neurophysiological criteria. At this point, three patients showed clinical and electrophysiological, and another two only electrophysiological alterations suggesting early neuropathy. This classification did not change after further clinical and electrophysiological controls. Without starting-point values, the early detection of neuropathy would not have been possible in all patients. No single reliable neurophysiological parameter for detection of thalidomide-induced neuropathy could be found. Pharmacogenetic classification with regard to hydroxylation and acetylation phenotypes was then performed in some patients and interpreted with relation to thalidomide neurotoxicity. A possible relationship between slow acetylators and development of thalidomide-induced neuropathy was found.
Although lead and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), both important environmental pollutants, activate cells through different receptors and participate in distinct upstream signaling pathways, Pb increases the amount of LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We examined the cells responsible for the excess production of Pb-increased LPS-induced TNF-alpha and liver injury, and the roles of protein kinase C (PKC) and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the induction of TNF-alpha. Peritoneal injection of Pb alone (100 micromol/kg) or a low dose of LPS (5 mg/kg) did not affect serum TNF-alpha or liver functions in A/J mice. In contrast, coexposure to these noneffective doses of Pb plus LPS (Pb+LPS) strongly induced TNF-alpha expression and resulted in profound liver injury. Direct inhibition of TNF-alpha or functional inactivation of monocytes/macrophages significantly decreased the level of Pb+LPS-induced serum TNF-alpha and concurrently ameliorated liver injury. Pb+LPS coexposure stimulated the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK and the expression of TNF-alpha in CD14+ cells of cultured mouse whole blood, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, blocking PKC or MAPK effectively reduced Pb+LPS-induced TNF-alpha expression and liver injury. In summary, monocytes/macrophages were the cells primarily responsible for producing, through the PKC/MAPK pathway, the excess Pb-increased/LPS-induced TNF-alpha that caused liver injury. alpha.
Abrupt withdrawal in a healthy man of oxymetazoline nasal spray precipitated a prolonged panic disorder that required hospitalization with extensive evaluations. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is discussed in light of locus ceruleus neuropharmacology. This may be the first report of such a withdrawal syndrome.
Six benzodiazepine tranquilizers were tested in limited in vivo bioassays for their ability to initiate or promote the development of preneoplastic and neoplastic rat liver lesions. The benzodiazepine produced no liver altered hepatocellular foci during a 14-week period of administration whereas a large number were produced by the liver carcinogen, N-2-fluorenylacetamide. To assay for promoting activity and confirm the lack of initiating activity, N-2-fluorenylacetamide was used to produce altered foci and early neoplastic nodules in rat liver by 8 weeks of dietary administration and the benzodiazepines were then administered for 12 weeks. The liver neoplasm promoter phenobarbital had a substantial enhancing effect upon the persistence of early lesions but none of the benzodiazepines showed a similar effect. Thus in these limited bioassays monitored by histopathology, the benzodiazepine tranquilizers failed to exhibit either an initiating or a promoting action. In these studies, the liver and plasma enzymes, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glutamate-oxalacetic transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatases, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase were monitored to determine if any alterations correlated with liver pathological changes. gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase activity in both liver and plasma was markedly increased during initiation by N-2-fluorenylacetamide. Following cessation of carcinogen exposure, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase remained elevated, providing an indication of past initiation. Administration of phenobarbital after N-2-fluorenylacetamide resulted in an elevation of liver and plasma gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, but none of the benzodiazepines produced this effect and thus no biochemical evidence of a promoting effect on the liver was observed. Correlations between liver and plasma gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and the occurrence of foci were excellent, indicating that determination of plasma activity can be used as an index of the process of hepatocarcinogenesis.
The present study was undertaken to clarify the epileptogenic activity induced by intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) antibiotics in mice. Teicoplanin (200 microg, i.c.v.) caused dose-related behavioral seizures such as head twitch and forelimb clonus. At the same time, the drug caused electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures characterized by spike-and-wave complex and a continuous spike with high amplitude. At a high dose (500 microg, i.c.v.), the drug caused a severe clonic convulsion followed by continuous spike and spike-and-wave complex on EEG. On the other hand, vancomycin caused no or almost no epileptogenic activity in both behavior and on EEG. Diazepam and sodium valproate dose-dependently antagonized epileptic seizures in behavior and on EEG induced by teicoplanin (500 microg, i.c.v.). In contrast, carbamazepine and ethosuximide caused no significant changes in both behavioral and EEG seizures induced by teicoplanin. From these findings, it can be concluded that teicoplanin may cause potent epileptogenic activity different from vancomycin when used clinically at extremely high doses. In addition, it may be that teicoplanin-induced seizure is closely related with the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic mechanism.
There is some evidence linking air pollution to cardiovascular morbidity. Our aim was to examine whether there is a correlation between air pollution and cardiovascular morbidity in the city of Trondheim, Norway.
We compared the mean daily number of admissions for cardiovascular disease to the St. Olav University hospital on days with relatively low and high levels of PM10 (1993-2001), PM2,5, NO, NO2, SO2, O3, toluene and paraxylene (1998-2001). A time series analysis was carried out to see how day-to-day variations in concentrations of air pollutants correlated with the number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease.
In the bivariate analysis, the mean daily number of hospitalizations was found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) on days with NO and NO2 levels above the 80 th percentile (57.6 microg/m3 and 43.1 microg/m3, respectively) than on days with pollutant levels below the 20th percentile (11.3 microg/m3 and 16.9 microg/m3, respectively). Time series analysis did not show any statistically significant correlation between day-to-day variations in air pollution and hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease.
The findings regarding NO2 and NO indicate that exposure to gases and/or ultra-small particles from diesel exhaust may influence cardiovascular morbidity.
Among 42 patients converted from clonidine to another antihypertensive medication, few sympathomimetic side effects were observed if the clonidine dosage had been less than 1.2 mg daily. Among a majority of 14 patients who had been taking larger doses, the previously reported syndrome of sympathetic hyperactivity was observed. It is particularly important to follow up patients who discontinue clonidine when this drug has been taken in excess of 1.2 mg daily.
Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is a bifunctional enzyme acting in de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide recycling. ADSL deficiency is a selectively neuronopathic disorder with psychomotor retardation and epilepsy as leading traits. Both dephosphorylated enzyme substrates, succinylaminoimidazole-carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado), accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of affected individuals with S-Ado/SAICAr concentration ratios proportional to the phenotype severity. We studied the disorder at various levels in a group of six patients with ADSL deficiency. We identified the complete ADSL cDNA and its alternatively spliced isoform resulting from exon 12 skipping. Both mRNA isoforms were expressed in all the tissues studied with the non-spliced form 10-fold more abundant. Both cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli and functionally characterized at the protein level. The results showed only the unspliced ADSL to be active. The gene consists of 13 exons spanning 23 kb. The promotor region shows typical features of the housekeeping gene. Eight mutations were identified in a group of six patients. The expression studies of the mutant proteins carried out in an attempt to study genotype-phenotype correlation showed that the level of residual enzyme activity correlates with the severity of the clinical phenotype. All the mutant enzymes studied in vitro displayed a proportional decrease in activity against both of their substrates. However, this was not concordant with strikingly different concentration ratios in the CSF of individual patients. This suggests either different in vivo enzyme activities against each of the substrates and/or their different turnover across the CSF-blood barrier, which may be decisive in determining disease severity.
Alizapride is a potent antiemetic, acting as a dopamine receptor antagonist on the chemoreceptor trigger zone with few gastrokinetic properties. Little is known of its activity on the human sphincter of Oddi (SO). The aim of this study was to assess the effect of alizapride on SO motor function and to evaluate a possible use of alizapride in premedication for endoscopy of the upper digestive tract. We selected ten patients who underwent retrograde cholangiopancreaticography, but had no evidence of biliary or pancreatic disease. Endoscopic manometry was applied before and for 10 min after administration of alizapride 100 mg i.v. No significant modification of basal pressure or phasic activity was observed. Alizapride can be proposed as an antiemetic in patients with biliary disorders.
Sixty patients with moderate or severe postsurgical pain were randomly divided into three equal groups for a double-blind comparison of the analgesic effectiveness of intramuscular butorphanol (2 and 4 mg) and pentazocine (60 mg). The groups were demographically similar. Pain intensity and pain relief were scored at 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after administration of the drug. All treatments provided significant analgesic activity (P less than .05) within ten minutes. However, both doses of butorphanol reached their peak effect at 30 minutes, in contrast to 60 minutes for pentazocine. The duration of effect appeared somewhat longer for butorphanol, though this did not achieve statistical significance. Butorphanol (4 mg) had a significantly greater (P less than .05) analgesic effect at ten minutes than pentazocine (60 mg), and both butorphanol treatments (2 and 4 mg) were significantly better than pentazocine, according to many parameters at 20 and 30 minutes. Side effects, chiefly sleepiness and dizziness, were seen in 15% of the patients, with no significant difference between the treatment groups.
Glyoxalase I [lactoylglutathione lyase (EC 4.4.1.5) encoded by GLO1] is a ubiquitous cellular defense enzyme involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic byproduct of glycolysis. Accumulative evidence suggests an important role of GLO1 expression in protection against methylglyoxal-dependent protein adduction and cellular damage associated with diabetes, cancer, and chronological aging. On the basis of the hypothesis that GLO1 upregulation may play a functional role in glycolytic adaptations of cancer cells, we examined GLO1 expression status in human melanoma tissue. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of a cDNA tissue array containing 40 human melanoma tissues (stages III and IV) and 13 healthy controls revealed pronounced upregulation of GLO1 expression at the mRNA level. Immunohistochemical analysis of a melanoma tissue microarray confirmed upregulation of glyoxalase I protein levels in malignant melanoma tissue versus healthy human skin. Consistent with an essential role of GLO1 in melanoma cell defense against methylglyoxal cytotoxicity, siRNA interference targeting GLO1-expression (siGLO1) sensitized A375 and G361 human metastatic melanoma cells towards the antiproliferative, apoptogenic, and oxidative stress-inducing activity of exogenous methylglyoxal. Protein adduction by methylglyoxal was increased in siGLO1-transfected cells as revealed by immunodetection using a monoclonal antibody directed against the major methylglyoxal-derived epitope argpyrimidine that detected a single band of methylglyoxal-adducted protein in human LOX, G361, and A375 total cell lysates. Using two-dimensional proteomics followed by mass spectrometry the methylglyoxal-adducted protein was identified as heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27; HSPB1). Taken together, our data suggest a function of GLO1 in the regulation of detoxification and target adduction by the glycolytic byproduct methylglyoxal in malignant melanoma.
Cutaneous vasculitis is an uncommon complication of propylthiouracil therapy. Its pathogenesis has been related to the presence of circulating immune complexes. The lesions may be purpuric or bullous hemorrhagic, possibly evolving into necrotic ulcerations. Usually, lesions develop on the extremities and earlobe. The vasculitis has been related to the duration of the treatment and disappears with the withdrawal of the drug, although a fatal case has been reported. Corticosteroid therapy is often prescribed, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated. We describe a patient in whom treatment with propylthiouracil for a year was associated with vasculitic lesions on the lower extremities and earlobe. Discontinuation of the drug was correlated with disappearance of the lesions.
The effects of daily bilateral microinjections of GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin (2 mcg) into rostral neostriatum of the rats in chronic experiments were investigated. The picrotoxin was injected in volume of 1 mcl of saline or in 1 mcl of 1.0 M or 1.5 M MgCl2 solution; 1 mcl of saline or 1.0 M MgCl2 solution were injected in control groups of animals. The impairment of the avoidance conditioning in shuttle box, changes in free locomotor activity and the stereotypic choreo-myoclonic limb jerks were registered in rats with picrotoxin with the saline microinjections. The motor deviation registered are similar with Huntington chorea hyperkinesis in humans. The addition of magnesium ions into injected solution prevented both the lyperkinesis and condition behaviour realization impairment. As the magnesium is a universal calcium channel blocker, the calcium homeostasis of striatal neurons impairment as one of principal elements of hyperkinesis pathogenesis is proposed.
In a 78-year-old woman receiving perhexiline maleate for intractable angina pectoris, a syndrome of parkinsonism and peripheral neuropathy developed. The neuropathy was confirmed by electromyographic and nerve conduction studies. The parkinsonism and peripheral neuropathy disappeared when perhexiline maleate was discontinued.
Previous epidemiological and toxicological studies have reported the associations between ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure and changes in heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. However, both the responsible components in PM and their mechanisms affecting HRV remain uncertain. We propose that carbon black (CB), one of the main components in PM, may affect HRV through mechanisms independent of cardio-pulmonary and systemic inflammation and/or injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed by intra-tracheal instillation to ultrafine CB (once every two days for three times) at doses of 0, 0.05, 0.15 and 0.6 mg/kg. HRV indices, standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and the square root of mean of sum of squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (RMSSD), showed significant decreases in 0.15 and 0.6 mg/kg CB exposed groups. Slight pulmonary inflammation and myocardial injury were only observed in 0.6 mg/kg CB exposed group. We conclude that CB can disturb cardiac ANS function in mice, indicated by the withdrawal of parasympathetic modulation, through mechanisms independent of apparent myocardial and pulmonary injury.
The effect of the intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of omega-conotoxin GVIA on penile erection and yawning induced by oxytocin or by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine was studied in male rats. The peptide toxin, 1-10 ng given ICV 5 min before oxytocin (30 ng ICV) or apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg SC), but not its carboxymethylated (CM) derivative, prevented the above behavioral responses in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, omega-conotoxin (5 ng) unilaterally injected in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) prevented penile erection and yawning induced by the microinjection of oxytocin (10 ng) or apomorphine (50 ng) in the PVN. omega-Conotoxin injected in the PVN, but not in the preoptic area, prevented also penile erection and yawning induced by systemic apomorphine (80 micrograms/kg SC). ICV omega-conotoxin was unable to prevent stereotypy induced by apomorphine (500 micrograms/kg SC). The present results provide further evidence that calcium plays a major role in the expression of penile erection and yawning and that apomorphine and oxytocin induce these behavioral responses by mobilizing calcium through omega-conotoxin-sensitive (N-type) calcium channels.
Corticosterone inhibits male rodent sexual behavior while the mechanism remains obscured. Recent studies have disclosed that neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) can be increased by pheromone exposure from the opposite sex, and neurogenesis is essential for normal mating behavior of female mice. Together with the neurogenesis-inhibiting effect of corticosterone, we hypothesize that cell proliferation in the olfactory system is essential for male rodent sexual functioning.
The current study explored the relationship between cell proliferation in the olfactory system and male sexual behavior.
Sexual behavior performance, proliferative cell counts, and c-fos-expressing cell counts.
Adult male rats were treated with corticosterone and/or paroxetine, an antidepressant, for 2 weeks. These two drugs were shown to suppress and enhance hippocampus and SVZ cell proliferation, respectively. Mating behavior was assessed after the treatment, and proliferation of new cells and c-fos-expressing cells, activated neurons in the mating-related regions in the brain, were analyzed. To further confirm the necessity of cell proliferation in mating, inhibition of cell proliferation was performed by intracerebroventricular infusion of cytostatic cytosine arabinose (Ara-c).
Corticosterone treatment, which inhibited cell proliferation in both the SVZ and olfactory epithelium, led to inhibited male sexual performance. In contrast, paroxetine increased cell proliferation and improved the performance in corticosterone-treated animals. When cell proliferation in the brain was inhibited by Ara-c, a suppressed sexual performance was found. However, cell proliferation in olfactory epithelium was not inhibited by Ara-c and thus the sexual inhibition is unlikely to be linked to this region. Furthermore, a decrease in c-fos expression in the mating-related regions upon female pheromone stimulation was found.
These results suggest that cell proliferation in the SVZ and hippocampus may be involved in the reproduction of the male rodents, and pharmacological treatments may affect sexual functioning through alteration of neurogenesis.
