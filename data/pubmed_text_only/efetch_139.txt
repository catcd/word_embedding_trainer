Animal models of liver failure are widely used for research of morphological and functional changes and pathogenetic mechanisms of hepatic encephalopathy. Changes in learning process and emotional state of rats, which were administered intraperitoneally (Phenobarbiton 40 mg/kg/day) for five days and then subcutaneously (Acetaminophen 1000 mg/kg) are described. Behaviour of rats was studied in the "open field". Experimental animals in comparison with the control group had decreased position-finding-exploring activity although the motor activity and the fear feeling level weren't changed. The testing in the multi branch maze showed that the experimental animal's learning ability was greatly decreased--from the start platform of the maze to the nest they made more mistakes and spent more time than the control group animals, and even at the end of the maze session successful completion of task (to reach the nest) wasn't exceeding 60%.
Research was initiated to develop an in vitro system to identify disinfection by-products with a potential to transform normal human colonocytes into malignant cells. Tribromomethane and bromochloroacetic acid, rodent colon carcinogens, dibromonitromethane and tribromonitromethane, recently identified in drinking water, and azoxymethane, a classic colon carcinogen, were tested for the ability to transform NCM460 cells. The chronic toxicity was determined for the series of trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids and halonitromethanes as well as NCM460 cell enzymatic capabilities. The order of cytotoxicity was halonitromethanes > haloacetic acids > trihalomethanes. Cytotoxicity within a series increased with the degree of bromination and decreased with the molecular weight. The genotoxicity profile was similar to that for cytotoxicity. Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that NCM460 cells possess glutathione-S transerase-1-1 and CYP450 activity similar to that measured in the large intestine. NCM460 cells were exposed to 10(-6) M of the test chemicals for three days. While NCM460 cells from all treatments had the ability to grow in soft agar to some extent, only cells exposed to azoxymethane or tribromomethane were able to grow in media lacking serum and growth factors. When sub cultured, NCM460 cells exposed to 10(-9) M azoxymethane for three weeks formed colonies with morphology distinct from untreated cells.
Although serum leptin concentrations are reported by several studies to increase in patients with liver cirrhosis, the mechanisms underpinning this increase remain unclear. Circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations are also recognized to increase in liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, TNF-alpha administration to rodents results in increased expression and secretion of leptin from adipose tissue in a manner dependent on type 1 TNF-alpha receptor (TNF-RI). The present study was undertaken to examine adipose leptin expression and to explore potential relationships between leptin expression and TNF-alpha in subjects with liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) administration or by common bile duct ligation (BDL). Ad libitum and pair-fed animals constituted controls. Serum leptin and TNF-alpha concentrations were determined by immunoassay. Gene expression was determined by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and protein levels were measured by Western blotting. Serum leptin values after adjustment of body fat mass in DMN-treated rats were significantly higher than in pair-fed or ad libitum groups. Leptin mRNA and protein levels in epididymal fat in DMN rats increased by 1.8-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively, as compared with ad libitum controls, and by 4-fold and 6-fold, respectively, as compared with the pair-fed group. Epididymal TNF-alpha and membranous TNF-RI (mTNF-RI) concentrations were both 2.3 times higher in DMN rats than in ad libitum controls but did not differ between ad libitum and pair-fed groups. Adipose leptin protein levels correlated directly with TNF-alpha and mTNF-RI concentrations in combined DMN, ad libitum, and pair-fed rats (r=0.64 and r=0.49, respectively; P<.05). In BDL-treated rats, however, serum and adipose leptin concentrations were identical to those in ad libitum controls despite 2.1-fold and 2.4-fold increase in epididymal TNF-alpha and mTNF-RI, respectively. TNF-alpha administration to fasting control animals increased serum and adipose leptin concentrations significantly. The observed TNF-alpha-associated leptin up-regulation in DMN-induced, but not in BDL-induced, cirrhotic rats is consistent with distinctly different roles for TNF-alpha in rats with nonbiliary, as opposed to biliary, cirrhosis.
Treatment of male Sprague-Dawley rats with kainic acid (10 mg/kg, i.p.) triggered limbic seizures in 60% of the animals starting within 30 min and lasting for about 6 h. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA was strongly induced in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, in the amygdala and the piriform cortex after 8 h, as shown by in situ hybridization, and returned to control levels after 72 h. At this time marked cell loss occurred in the CA1-CA3 areas of the hippocampus. We hypothesize that rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, might abbreviate the late neurotoxicity, possibly associated with COX-2 induction. Animals which developed seizures were treated for 3 days with rofecoxib (10 mg/kg, i.p., n = 12) starting 6 or 8 h after kainic acid injection. Histological staining of viable cells confirmed that rofecoxib treatment selectively diminished cell loss in the hippocampus. The TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) technique was used to estimate delayed cell death. Abundant TUNEL-positive cells were detected in seizure rats 72 h after kainic acid injection in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (CA1-CA3), in cells of the thalamus, the amygdala and the piriform cortex. Treatment with rofecoxib selectively and significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus, whereas the cells of the thalamus, amygdala and piriform cortex were not protected. Therefore we conclude that COX-2 might contribute to cell death of pyramidal cells of the hippocampus as a consequence of limbic seizures.
Oculogyric crisis (OGC) is an underrecognized oculodystonic reaction associated with several medications including carbamazepine. The authors present a patient who had presented to the emergency department on multiple occasions with a questionable ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt dysfunction. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, altered level of consciousness, ataxia, and vertical eye deviation. The patient underwent multiple revisions of the VP shunt with transient and questionable improvement. During her visit to the neurology clinic, OGC from carbamazepine was suspected, and the dose was reduced. The patient has been completely asymptomatic for the past 18 months. The authors report this case to increase the awareness of carbamazepine-induced OGC as one of the differential diagnoses for VP shunt dysfunction.
This study investigated whether the nitric oxide pathway was involved in the central effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), the major psychoactive constituent of cannabis sativa. Body temperature, nociception and locomotion were measured in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) knock-out (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) controls after intraperitoneal application of Delta(9)-THC. These Delta(9)-THC-induced effects are known to be mediated through the brain-type cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). Therefore, in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments were performed in the adult murine brain to determine possible changes in CB1 mRNA levels in nNOS-KO, compared with WT mice, and to reveal brain areas where CB1 and nNOS were coexpressed in the same neurons. We found that an intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg Delta(9)-THC led to the same increase in the hot plate latencies in both genotypes, suggesting that Delta(9)-THC-mediated antinociception does not involve nNOS. In contrast, a significant Delta(9)-THC-induced decrease of body temperature and locomotor activity was only observed in WT, but not in nNOS-KO mice. ISH revealed significantly lower levels of CB1 mRNA in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the caudate putamen (Cpu) of the nNOS-KO animals, compared with WT mice. Both areas are known to be among the regions involved in cannabinoid-induced thermoregulation and decrease of locomotion. A numerical evaluation of nNOS/CB1 coexpression showed that approximately half of the nNOS-positive cells in the dorsolateral Cpu also express low levels of CB1. ISH of adjacent serial sections with CB1 and nNOS, revealed expression of both transcripts in VMH, suggesting that numerous nNOS-positive cells of VMH coexpress CB1. Our findings indicate that the nitric oxide pathway is involved in some, but not all of the central effects of Delta(9)-THC.
The anticonvulsant effects of felbamate (10-300 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, IP), and those of two representative antagonists of the excitatory amino acid receptors, 5-7 dichlorokynurenic acid (5-7DCKA; 0.6-30 nmol/mouse, intracerebroventricularly, ICV), and 2, 3-dihydroxy-6 nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo (F) quinoxoline (NBQX; 1.1-33.6 mg/kg, IP) were studied in the DBA/2 mice. All drugs protected the animals from sound-induced seizures. The drugs were also effective against seizures induced by stimulation of the excitatory amino acid receptor complex using the agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5 methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). In separate studies, felbamate protected mice from seizures induced by ICV administration of the activator of dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels, methyl-1, 4-dihydro-2, 6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl) pyridine-5-carboxylate (Bay k 8644), with ED50 values of 26 and 46.9 mg/kg for tonus and clonus, respectively. Using Bay k 8644, NBQX (1-40 mg/kg IP) was uneffective, while 5,7DCKA (5-90 nmol/mouse, ICV) protected mice against tonus. Moreover, felbamate prevented seizures induced by blocking voltage-dependent K+ channels using alpha-dendrotoxin, with ED50 values of 22.6 mg/kg for tonus and of 34.8 mg/kg for clonus. Conversely, 5,7DCKA or NBQX did not significantly antagonize seizures induced by alpha-dendrotoxin. The present data indicate that felbamate is an effective anticonvulsant drug in DBA/2 mice with a broader anticonvulsant spectrum than 5,7DCKA and NBQX.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and degeneration of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Although L-DOPA treatment provides the most effective symptomatic relief for PD it does not prevent the progression of the disease, and its long-term use is associated with the onset of dyskinesia. In rodent and primate studies, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) may prevent 6-OHDA- or MPTP-induced nigral degeneration and so may be beneficial in the treatment of PD. In this study, we investigate the effects of GDNF on the expression of dyskinesia in L-DOPA-primed MPTP-treated common marmosets, exhibiting dyskinesia. GDNF or saline was administered by two intraventricular injections, 4 weeks apart, to MPTP-treated, L-DOPA-treated common marmosets primed to exhibit dyskinesia. Prior to GDNF or saline administration, all animals displayed marked dyskinesia when treated with L-DOPA. GDNF administration produced a significant improvement in motor disability and, following the second injection of GDNF, a significant improvement in the locomotor activity was observed. Following the administration of L-DOPA there was a greater reversal of disability and a reduction in the intensity of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in GDNF-treated animals compared to saline-treated controls. However, there was no significant difference in L-DOPA's ability to increase locomotor activity between GDNF-treated and saline-treated animals. GDNF treatment caused a significant increase in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, but no change in [(3)H]mazindol binding to dopamine terminals was found in the striatum of GDNF-treated animals compared to saline-treated controls. In GDNF-treated animals a small but significant reduction in enkephalin mRNA was observed in the caudate nucleus but not in the putamen or the nucleus accumbens. Substance P mRNA expression was equally reduced in the caudate nucleus and the putamen of the GDNF-treated animals but not in the nucleus accumbens. Intraventricular administration of GDNF improved MPTP-induced disability and reversed dopamine cell loss in the substantia nigra. GDNF also diminished L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, which may relate to its ability to partly restore nigral dopaminergic transmission or to modify the activity of striatal output pathways.
Ocular malformations are commonly observed in embryos of aquatic species after exposure to toxicants. Using zebrafish embryos as the model organism, we showed that cadmium exposure from sphere stage (4 hpf) to end of segmentation stage (24 hpf) induced microphthalmia in cadmium-treated embryos. Embryos with eye defects were then assessed for visual abilities. Cadmium-exposed embryos were behaviorally blind, showing hyperpigmentation and loss of camouflage response to light. We investigated the cellular basis of the formation of the small eyes phenotype and the induction of blindness by studying retina development and retinotectal projections. Retinal progenitors were found in cadmium-treated embryos albeit in smaller numbers. The number of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), the first class of retinal cells to differentiate during retinogenesis, was reduced, while photoreceptor cells, the last batch of retinal neurons to differentiate, were absent. Cadmium also affected the propagation of neurons in neurogenic waves. The neurons remained in the ventronasal area and failed to spread across the retina. Drastically reduced RGC axons and disrupted optic stalk showed that the optic nerves did not extend from the retina beyond the chiasm into the tectum. Our data suggested that impairment in neuronal differentiation of the retina, disruption in RGC axon formation and absence of cone photoreceptors were the causes of microphthalmia and visual impairment in cadmium-treated embryos.
Recently, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) published recommendations on the management of patients with primary systemic vasculitides. The use of the given definitions for different activities and stages of the diseases is encouraged not only in clinical trails but also for the purpose of harmonisation in daily routine. Concerning the diagnostic work-up an interdisciplinary approach in co-operation with expert-centre is recommended. Therapy consists of remission induction and maintenance. For induction therapy in small vessel vasculitis cyclophosphamide or medium potent immunosuppressants such as methotrexate plus glucocorticoids should be used according to disease stage and activity. Glucocorticoids also represent the mainstay of remission induction in large vessel vasculitis. Additional immunosuppressants should be considered, if the disease can not be controlled by glucocorticoids or for the purpose of sparing glucocorticoids. Refractory disease should be treated within clinical trails. Further recommendations deal with monitoring of diseases activity and therapy as well as with measures to avoid complications and late sequelae.
Recently, neuroligins (NLs)3 and 4X have received much attention as autism-related genes. Here, we identified syntrophin-gamma2 (SNTG2) as a de novo binding partner of NL3. SNTG2 also bound to NL4X and NL4Y. Interestingly, the binding was influenced by autism-related mutations, implying that the impaired interaction between NLs and SNTG2 contributes to the etiology of autism.
Ten patients presenting agitation and anger outbursts at various stages following a severe closed head injury, were treated in a prospective open trial with carbamazepine, with doses ranging from 400 to 800 mg per day, during 8 weeks. Group analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of a score made up from six target items from the neurobehavioural rating scale. Improvement mainly concerned irritability and disinhibition. A statistically significant improvement was also found with the Agitated Behaviour Scale. Social functioning, as assessed by family or staff ratings of the Katz Adjustment Scale, also significantly improved. No modification of global cognitive functioning was found with the Mini Mental Status Examination. Individual analysis demonstrated that the beneficial effect was important in five cases, moderate in three patients and negligible in two cases. It is concluded that carbamazepine might help to reduce agitated behaviour in brain-injured patients. However, response to treatment demonstrated an important inter-individual variability.
Individuals deficient in hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) activity (MAT I/III deficiency) have been demonstrated to contain mutations in the gene (MATA1) that encodes the major hepatic forms, MAT I and III. MAT I/III deficiency is characterized by isolated persistent hypermethioninemia and, in some cases, unusual breath odor. Most individuals with isolated hypermethioninemia have been free of major clinical difficulties. Therefore a definitive diagnosis of MAT I/III deficiency, which requires hepatic biopsy, is not routinely made. However, two individuals with isolated hypermethioninemia have developed abnormal neurological problems, including brain demyelination, suggesting that MAT I/III deficiency can be deleterious. In the present study we have examined the MATA1 gene of eight hypermethioninemic individuals, including the two with demyelination of the brain. Mutations that abolish or reduce the MAT activity were detected in the MATA1 gene of all eight individuals. Both patients with demyelination are homozygous for mutations that alter the reading frame of the encoded protein such that the predicted MATalpha1 subunits are truncated and enzymatically inactive. The product of MAT, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), is the major methyl donor for a large number of biologically important compounds including the two major myelin phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Both are synthesized primarily in the liver. Our findings demonstrate that isolated persistent hypermethioninemia is a marker of MAT I/III deficiency, and that complete lack of MAT I/III activity can lead to neurological abnormalities. Therefore, a DNA-based diagnosis should be performed for individuals with isolated hypermethioninemia to assess if therapy aimed at the prevention of neurological manifestations is warranted.
To test the effects of chlorothiazide on vitamin-D2-induced hypercalciuria, we carried out 17 metabolic studies lasting 12 days each in adult Sprague-Dawley male rats. Three groups were studied: (A) control rats receiving only the vitamin-D2 vehicle; (B) vitamin-D2-treated rats receiving 50 IU/day; and (C) rats treated in the same manner as group B with the addition of chlorothiazide 20 mg/day for the last 6 days of the study. Urine was collected during the last 3 days, and a blood sample was obtained at the end of each study period. Analysis of the data showed that there were no significant differences between the groups in changes of serum calcium concentration (A, 6.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl; B, 6.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl; C, 6.0 +/- 0.2 mg/dl), serum creatinine concentration (A, 0.5 +/- 0.07 mg/dl; B, 0.52 +/- 0.08 mg/dl; C, 0.48 +/- 0.04 mg/dl), and creatinine clearance (A, 4.8 +/- 0.7 ml/min/kg; B, 5.2 +/- 1.2 ml/min/kg; C, 4.9 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg). The administration of vitamin-D2 significantly increased the urinary calcium excretion from 6.7 +/- 1.0 mg/kg/day to 19.5 +/- 9.7 mg/kg/day (p less than 0.02), but the calciuria was inhibited in group C rats by the addition of chlorothiazide, which restored urinary calcium excretion to 6.8 +/- 2.5 mg/kg/day (p less than 0.02). Evaluation of the ratio of calcium/creatinine excretion (A, 0.19 +/- 0.03; B, 0.53 +/- 0.25; C, 0.20 +/- 0.07) and calcium/sodium excretion (A, 0.22 +/- 0.05; B, 0.48 +/- 0.25; C, 0.19 +/- 0.04) further confirmed these effects of vitamin-D2 and chlorothiazide on urine calcium excretion. We conclude that in rats conventional doses of vitamin-D2 consistently induce marked hypercalciuria, even without hypercalcemia, and that this hypercalciuria can be effectively prevented by chlorothiazide.
Four materials viz. zinc oxide-eugenol, iodoform paste, Kri paste, Maisto's paste and Vitapex (Calcium hydroxide + iodoform) were tested for their antibacterial effect against the aerobic and anerobic bacteria, viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and mixed bacterial culture; obtained from infected non-vital deciduous anterior teeth. The antimicrobial sensitivity was checked on BHI-agar plates using well method. The results showed that all the 4 materials were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. Maisto's paste was invariably the superior most in its antibacterial efficacy (in comparison to all the 5 micro-organism strains). Iodoformized zincoxide eugenol appeared to be the second best followed by Kri paste. Vitapex showed the least antibacterial activity.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was expressed widely in NPC. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference of expression of EGFR and Ki67 in primary and recurrence of NPC to supply a micro-evidence of anti-EGFR targeted maintenance therapy for NPC. A retrospective review of 40 patients with clinical stages I-IV b was performed. Chemoradiation was included chemotherapy with fluorouracil plus cisplatin and irradiation for primary and lymph draining regions. All patients were verified tumor locoregional relapse with/or without distant metastasis by CT or MRI after combined CRT by primary and recurrence biopsies. The correlation between EGFR and Ki67 expression inspected by immunohistochemistry was analyzed. The difference of time to recurrence grouped by different expressions of EGFR and Ki67 was compared by log-rank test. The median follow-up time was 20.0 months ± 2.70 (range 23-71). EGFR and Ki67 expression in primary was not significantly different with recurrent focus. A strong significant correlation between EGFR and Ki67 molecules expression was obtained in primary (r = 0.573; P = 0.001) and in recurrent focus (r = 0.698; P = 0.000). A significantly shorter time to locoregional relapse in patients with positive expression of EGFR than patients with negative EGFR expression in primary (P = 0.010) and in relapse (P = 0.022). There was no significant difference of EGFR and Ki67 expression in primary and recurrence tumor expression. The time to relapse was significantly shorter in high expression of EGFR, which might supply micro-evidence to anti-EGFR targeted maintenance therapy for those patients with EGFR overexpression in primary tumor.
High blood pressure results in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, increased thickness and stiffness of large artery walls, and decreased renal function. The objective of our study was to assess the role of endothelin, angiotensin II, and high blood pressure in the end-organ damage observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). For this purpose, SHR were treated for 10 weeks with either a mixed endothelin-A and endothelin-B receptor antagonist, bosentan (100 mg/kg per day), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg/kg per day), or a long-acting calcium antagonist, mibefradil (20 mg/kg per day). A group of SHR was left untreated, and a group of normotensive Wistar rats was used as control. At the end of treatment, maximal coronary blood flow was measured in isolated perfused hearts. Cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, aortic medial thickness, and extracellular matrix content were evaluated by quantitative morphometry. Proteinuria and urea and creatinine clearances were measured, and renal histopathology was assessed. SHR exhibited cardiac hypertrophy, perivascular fibrosis, and decreased maximal coronary blood flow. Aortic medial thickness was increased, whereas elastin density was decreased. Finally, SHR showed decreased urinary excretion and decreased urea and creatinine clearances. No renal histological lesions were observed. Although bosentan did not affect blood pressure, it normalized renal function and slightly decreased left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis. Enalapril and mibefradil were both effective in significantly decreasing blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and aortic medial thickness and improving coronary blood flow, but in contrast to bosentan, they did not improve creatinine clearance. We conclude that in SHR, high blood pressure plays a major role in end-organ damage and that endothelin may partly mediate renal dysfunction and cardiac remodeling independently of a direct hemodynamic effect.
Intravenous injection of NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, elevated mean blood pressure by 29.0 +/- 4.9 mm Hg and decreased heart rate by 40.7 +/- 5.6 beats per minute in anesthetized Japanese monkeys (n = 6), whereas NG-nitro-D-arginine was without effect. After pretreatment with pentolinium, the magnitude of the pressure elevation by L-NA was significantly less than that after pretreatment with phentol-amine. The reduced blood pressure by either of the pretreatment drugs was compensated to control levels by a continuous infusion of angiotensin II before L-NA administration. Isolated monkey distal mesenteric arteries (150 to 200 microns OD) without endothelium responded to nerve stimulation by nicotine with a contraction, which was abolished by prazosin alone or in combination with alpha, beta-methylene ATP. In the strips thus treated and contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, nicotine caused a relaxation that L-NA abolished. L-NA but not NG-nitro-D-arginine reversed the inhibition. Histochemical staining of NADPH diaphorase, considered to be identical to nitric oxide synthase in neuronal tissues, demonstrated that positively stained nerve fibers were consistently present in the adventitia of monkey distal mesenteric arteries and arterioles. These results strongly suggest that nitroxidergic vasodilator nerves innervate peripheral small arteries and arterioles in the monkey and that these nerves participate in the regulation of systemic blood pressure. High blood pressure caused by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors is associated with an elimination of nitroxidergic nerve function together with an impairment of the basal release of nitric oxide from the endothelium.
Eleven days after administration of multiple penicillin analogs, a 55-year-old female developed a Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia. The patient's erythrocytes were coated with IgG, complement components (C4/C3) and her serum contained elevated 125I-Clq binding activity (a measure of the presence of immune complexes). Her serum, in the presence of fresh complement and penicillin, induced complement sensitization of normal erythrocytes. Immune complex-mediated complement activation and the haptene type of erythrocyte sensitization accounted for accelerated red blood cell destruction in this patient.
Human health effects of inhaled mycotoxins remain poorly documented, despite the large amounts present in bioaerosols. Among these mycotoxins, sterigmatocystin is one of the most prevalent. Our aim was to study the metabolism and cellular consequences of sterigmatocystin once it is in contact with the airway epithelium. Metabolites were analyzed first in vitro, using recombinant P450 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2A13, and 3A4 enzymes, and subsequently in porcine tracheal epithelial cell (PTEC) primary cultures at an air-liquid interface. Expressed enzymes and PTECs were exposed to sterigmatocystin, uniformly enriched with (13)C to confirm the relationship between sterigmatocystin and metabolites. Induction of the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes upon sterigmatocystin exposure was examined by real-time quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Incubation of 50 μM sterigmatocystin with recombinant P450 1A1 led to the formation of three metabolites: monohydroxy-sterigmatocystin (M1), dihydroxy-sterigmatocystin (M2), and one glutathione adduct (M3), the latter after the formation of a transient epoxide. Recombinant P450 1A2 also led to M1 and M3. P450 3A4 led to only M3. In PTEC, 1 μM sterigmatocystin metabolism resulted in a glucuro conjugate (M4) mainly excreted at the basal side of cells. If PTEC were treated with β-naphthoflavone prior to sterigmatocystin incubation, two other products were detected, i.e., a sulfo conjugate (M5) and a glucoro conjugate (M6) of hydroxy-sterigmatocystin. Exposure of PTEC for 24 h to 1 μM sterigmatocystin induced an 18-fold increase in the mRNA levels of P450 1A1, without significantly induced 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation activity. These data suggest that sterigmatocystin is mainly detoxified and is unable to produce significant amounts of reactive epoxide metabolites in respiratory cells. However, sterigmatocystin increases the P450 1A1 mRNA levels with unknown long-term consequences. These in vitro results obtained in the porcine pulmonary tract need to be confirmed in human epithelial cells.
We studied the effect of plasmin inhibitor on ethanol and ammonia-induced gastric mucosal lesions in rats using an ex vivo chamber. Tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid significantly inhibited macroscopic gastric hemorrhagic necrosis and attenuated the decrease of gastric transmucosal potential difference induced by 50% ethanol and 1% ammonia. The protection of gastric mucosa afforded by tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid was not affected by pretreatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg). These results suggest that plasmin inhibitor plays an important role in the prevention of gastric deep necrosis following exposure of the stomach to a damaging agent.
To determine the safety of intramuscular ketamine when administered by emergency physicians for pediatric procedures in accordance with a defined protocol.
We assembled a consecutive case series of children aged 15 years or younger who were given ketamine in the emergency departments of a university medical center and an affiliated county hospital over a 9-year period. A protocol for ketamine use (4 mg/kg, intramuscularly) was followed. Treating physicians were instructed to complete data forms recording complications and adequacy of sedation concurrent with patient care. Subsequent chart review was used to determine indications, adjunctive drugs, time to discharge, and adverse reactions for all patients.
Intramuscular ketamine was administered 1,022 times, mainly for laceration repair and fracture reduction. Physicians completed data forms for 431 of treated children (42%). Transient airway complications occurred in 1.4%: airway malalignment (n = 7), laryngospasm (n = 4), apnea (n = 2), and respiratory depression (n = 1). All were quickly identified and treated without intubation or sequelae. Emesis occurred in 6.7%, without evidence of aspiration. Mild recovery agitation occurred in 17.6%, moderate to severe agitation in 1.6%. No child required hospitalization for complications caused by ketamine. Ketamine produced acceptable sedation in 98% of patients. The median time from injection to emergency department discharge was 110 minutes for children given a single dose of ketamine.
Intramuscular ketamine may be administered safely by emergency physicians to facilitate pediatric procedures in accordance with a defined protocol and with appropriate monitoring. Ketamine is highly effective, has a wide margin of safety, does not require intravenous access, and uniquely preserves protective airway reflexes.
Nearly half the rats gavage-fed with aspirin and aspirin-containing mixtures developed papillary necrosis in 20 weeks. This incidence is similar to that found in rats on A.P.C. mixtures with high and low concentrations of p-chloracetanilide, an impurity of phenacetin. Aspirin alone produced necrosis in 7 out of 19 rats (36.8%) whereas phenacetin in the same dose had failed to cause any renal damage over six to nine months. If these results also apply to man they suggest that aspirin and not phenacetin may be the major factor in analgesic nephropathy in patients taking A.P.C. mixtures. An augmented clearance of aspirin appeared to afford some protection to the medulla, and it is suggested that this observation may have important clinical and epidemiological applications.
