We investigated the effect of niacin (nicotinic acid prolonged release) on forearm vasodilatory function and arterial compliance in statin-treated type 2 diabetic patients with endothelial dysfunction. In a parallel group study, we randomised 15 subjects, with LDL-cholesterol ≤2.5 mmol/L, to niacin (dose titrated to 1500 mg/day over 8 weeks, then maintained for a further 12 weeks) or no additional treatment. Niacin increased maximal post-ischaemic forearm blood flow (mean ± SEM 6.4±2.4 vs. -2.3±1.2 ml/100 ml/min, p = 0.001) and small artery compliance (1.3±0.8 vs. -2.3±1.1 ml/mmHg, p = 0.01) compared with no additional treatment, but did not alter large artery compliance, blood pressure nor heart rate. Niacin decreased serum triglycerides by 47% (p = 0.04), with no change in LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) B-100 nor ApoA-I (p > 0.05). Adding niacin to statin therapy improves small artery vasodilatory function and compliance in type 2 diabetes. This may relate to a decrease in serum triglycerides and/or a direct benefit of niacin on vascular biology.
The nephrotic syndrome is a rare, idiosyncratic adverse renal effect of lithium that can occur with therapeutic plasma lithium levels. The syndrome is usually reversed by discontinuation of lithium treatment but may require corticosteroids. Renal biopsies reveal fusion of the foot processes of renal epithelial cells, referred to as "minimal change disease." No particular variable identifies individuals at risk for developing the nephrotic syndrome while taking lithium. The authors review the eight published cases in the English-language literature and present the case of an adolescent who developed lithium-induced nephrotic syndrome.
Malaria is no doubt a disease of public health significance in the tropics. Plasmodium falciparum resistant to majority of the first-line antimalarial drugs now causes most of the infections treated in sub-Saharan Africa. Although there is increasing use of artemisinin-based combination therapy in many African nations, quinine still remains a commonly used drug for severe and chloroquine-resistant malaria. Cardiotoxicity associated with quinine has been largely reported. However, this was often more common with toxic doses. This case report is on a 5-year-old African Nigerian who was on treatment for uncomplicated malaria with quinine dihydrochloride infusion. All the laboratory investigations done were within normal limits except for positive blood films for malarial parasites. However, pre-treatment electrocardiographic evaluation of the patient was not carried out. She developed ventricular fibrillation and died less than one and a half hour into the quinine infusion.
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is believed to play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. Five alpha reductase type II (SRD5A2) and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (HSD3B2) are responsible for the biosynthesis and degradation of DHT in the prostate. Two polymorphisms, a valine (V) for leucine (L) substitution at the 89 codon of the SRD5A2 gene and a (TG)n,(TA)n,(CA)n repeat polymorphism within the third intron of the HSD3B2 gene were evaluated with regard to prostate cancer risk.
Blood samples were collected for 637 prostate cancer cases and 244 age and race frequency matched controls. In analysis, the SRD5A2 VL and LL genotypes were combined into one group and the HSD3B2 repeat polymorphism was dichotomized into short (<283) and long (> or =283) alleles.
The SRD5A2 V89L polymorphism was not independently associated with prostate cancer risk. Carriage of at least one HSD3B2 intron 3 intron 3 short allele was associated with a significant increased risk for prostate cancer among all subjects (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.08-3.95, P = 0.03) and Caucasians (OR = 2.80, CI = 2.80-7.43, P = 0.04), but not in African Americans (OR = 1.50, CI = 0.62-3.60, P = 0.37). Stratified analyses revealed that most of the prostate cancer risk associated with the intron 3 HSD3B2 short allele was confined to the SRD5A2 89L variant subgroup and indicated that in combination these polymorphisms may be associated with increased risk of aggressive (Gleason >7) disease (Gleason >7).
In Caucasians, the HSD3B2 (TG)n,(TA)n,(CA)n intron 3 length polymorphism is associated with both prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness and the SRD5A2 V89L polymorphism may modify the risk conferred by this polymorphism.
Delta-aminolevulinic acid (delta-ALA) is a heme precursor implicated in neurological complications associated with porphyria and tyrosinemia type I. Delta-ALA is also elevated in the urine of animals and patients treated with the investigational drug dichloroacetate (DCA). We postulated that delta-ALA may be responsible, in part, for the peripheral neuropathy observed in subjects receiving DCA. To test this hypothesis, myelinating cocultures of Schwann cells and sensory neurons were exposed to delta-ALA (0.1-1 mM) and analyzed for the expression of neural proteins and lipids and markers of oxidative stress. Exposure of myelinating samples to delta-ALA is associated with a pronounced reduction in the levels of myelin-associated lipids and proteins, including myelin protein zero and peripheral myelin protein 22. We also observed an increase in protein carbonylation and the formation of hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde after treatment with delta-ALA. Studies of isolated Schwann cells and neurons indicate that glial cells are more vulnerable to this pro-oxidant than neurons, based on a selective decrease in the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins in glial, but not in neuronal, cells. These results suggest that the neuropathic effects of delta-ALA are attributable, at least in part, to its pro-oxidant properties which damage myelinating Schwann cells.
Three patients treated with bromocriptine for chronic hepatic encephalopathy showed audiometric evidence of bilateral sensori-neural hearing-loss. Audiometrically, the hearing improved in all three patients when the bromocriptine dosage was reduced, thus suggesting that this drug may produce a reversible ototoxicity.
This paper describes research relating to the major recall of pet food that occurred in Spring 2007 in North America. Clinical observations of acute renal failure in cats and dogs were associated with consumption of wet pet food produced by a contract manufacturer producing for a large number of companies. The affected lots of food had been formulated with wheat gluten originating from China. Pet food and gluten were analyzed for contaminants using several configurations of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS), which revealed a number of simple triazine compounds, principally melamine and cyanuric acid, with lower concentrations of ammeline, ammelide, ureidomelamine, and N-methylmelamine. Melamine and cyanuric acid, have been tested and do not produce acute renal toxicity. Some of the triazines have poor solubility, as does the compound melamine cyanurate. Pathological evaluation of cats and dogs that had died from the acute renal failure indicated the presence of crystals in kidney tubules. We hypothesized that these crystals were composed of the poorly soluble triazines, a melamine-cyanuric acid complex, or a combination. Sprague dawley rats were given up to 100 mg/kg ammeline or ammelide alone, a mixture of melamine and cyanuric acid (400/400 mg/kg/day), or a mixture of all four compounds (400 mg/kg/day melamine, 40 mg/kg/day of the others). Neither ammeline nor ammelide alone produced any renal effects, but the mixtures produced significant renal damage and crystals in nephrons. HPLC-MS/MS confirmed the presence of melamine and cyanuric acid in the kidney. Infrared microspectroscopy on individual crystals from rat or cat (donated material from a veterinary clinic) kidneys confirmed that they were melamine-cyanuric acid cocrystals. Crystals from contaminated gluten produced comparable spectra. These results establish the causal link between the contaminated gluten and the adverse effects and provide a mechanistic explanation for how two apparently innocuous compounds could have adverse effects in combination, that is, by forming an insoluble precipitate in renal tubules leading to progressive tubular blockage and degeneration.
Since hypertension may compromise the ability to withstand hypernatremic dehydration, we investigated the impact of two experimental models of hypertension and pharmacologic normalization of blood pressure on the tolerance to chronic hypernatremic dehydration. In DOCA-salt hypertensive animals and the spontaneously-hypertensive rat (SHR), there was increased mortality and cerebral cell shrinkage during hypernatremic dehydration, compared to control Sprague-Dawley or Wistar-Kyoto rats. These findings were paralleled by significant differences in the brain intracellular water compartment size (ml/100 g dry weight), i.e. 233 +/- 6, Sprague-Dawley vs 189 +/- 8, DOCA-salt, P less than 0.01; 246 +/- 3, Wistar-Kyoto vs 194 +/- 6, SHR, P less than 0.01. Normalization of the blood pressure in the SHR with captopril restored 48% of the cerebral cell volume regulatory capacity observed in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. We conclude that sustained hypertension increases the risk of hypernatremic dehydration in select circumstances. Correction of the elevated blood pressure promotes partial recovery of normal cerebral cell volume regulation.
Previously, we found that the H1 histamine receptor antagonist diphenhydramine induces apoptosis in human acute T-lymphocytic leukemia cells. Since histamine has been shown to act as a growth factor in malignant melanoma cells, we decided to evaluate the in vitro effect of diphenhydramine and other H1 histamine receptor antagonists, such as terfenadine, astemizol and triprolidine on four malignant human melanoma cell lines. These antagonists were found to induce apoptotic cell death in all four melanoma cell lines. Apoptosis was determined by assessment of phosphatidylserine exposure on the surface of the cells and nuclear fragmentation. Importantly, H1 antagonist treatments did not adversely affect the viability of human melanocytes and murine fibroblasts at the same doses and duration of exposure. Treatment of melanoma cells with terfenadine induced DNA damage and caspases 2, 3, 6, 8 and 9 activation. Furthermore, the general caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-FMK) and a selective inhibitor of caspase-2 (z-VDVAD-FMK) protected melanoma cells from terfenadine-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-FMK) was ineffective. In addition, we found that mitochondria are involved in TEF-induced apoptosis, characterized by the dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the release of cytochrome c into the cytosolic compartment and caspase-9 activation. On the basis of these results we conclude that H1 histamine receptor antagonists induce apoptosis in human melanoma cells but not in normal melanocytes and embryonic murine fibroblasts; this apoptosis appears to be caspase-2-dependent and involves the mitochondrial pathway. The present results may contribute to the elaboration of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of malignant human melanoma.
The carcinogenicity of benzyl chloride (BYC), benzal chloride (BAC), benzotrichloride (BTC) and benzoyl chloride (BOC), which were suspected as causative agents of lung cancer and maxillary malignant lymphoma of workers employed in factories producing BOC, was examined by skin applications in female ICR mice. After rather high dose exposure, BTC exhibited leukemogenic and pulmonary tumorigenic activities as well as potent dermal carcinogenic activity. After administration of the chemicals at the dose of 2.3 microliter/animal, twice a week for 50 weeks, BTC induced 68% incidence of skin cancers and 58% incidence of pulmonary tumors (including 10% of lung carcinomas) within 399 days. Incidence of skin cancers was 58% for BAC, 15% for BYC and 10% for BOC within 560 days. Considering the extent of possible exposure of the workers to these chemicals in the working environment and the carcinogenic potency of the chemicals tested, it can be concluded that BTC was very probably responsible for causing the cancers seen int he workers employed in manufacturing BOC.
The antifibrotic substance pirfenidone and the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist candesartan cilexetil, given alone and in combination, were tested in rats with chronic anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM GN).
Male Wistar rats with anti-GBM GN were treated for 8 weeks with candesartan (4 mg/kg body weight/day), pirfenidone (500 mg/kg body weight/day) or a combination of both drugs. One GN group received no treatment and untreated non-GN-rats were used as controls. Blood pressure and urinary protein excretion were measured after 3 and 7 weeks. Kidney histology was complemented by ultrastructural investigation and by quantification of collagen Ialpha mRNA.
The percentage of glomeruli with adsorption droplets in podocytes correlated well with the amount of proteinuria (r = 0.873, P<0.01) and was significantly lowered in rats treated with candesartan (8.3 vs GN 24.6%), pirfenidone (9.8%) and combined treatment (2.6%, P<0.05 vs candesartan alone). A comparable lowering was seen for segmental sclerosis (GN 11%, candesartan 0.7%, P<0.05 vs GN, pirfenidone 1.8%, P = 0.09 vs GN, candesartan/pirfenidone 0.1%, P>0.5 vs candesartan alone). Cortical collagen Ialpha mRNA expression was significantly decreased in all treatment groups. Ultrastructural investigation showed an amelioration of basement membrane alterations and podocyte damage in the treatment groups. Candesartan caused significant blood pressure reduction and the effect was significantly enhanced by combination therapy after 3 weeks. Rats treated with pirfenidone showed blood pressure values similar to control rats.
Pirfenidone has a beneficial effect on morphological changes in anti-GBM GN comparable with candesartan although with a trend to slightly better results with candesartan treatment. Moreover, our results suggest an additive effect of combination treatment.
In nonsmall cell lung cancer, tumor parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) expression predicts longer survival in women but not in men. To explain the sex-dependent survival effect, the authors proposed that hormonal influences decrease PTHrP in men versus women, that PTHrP inhibits tumor growth, and that the effect is greater in women than in men. The objectives of this study were to compare lung carcinoma PTHrP expression and carcinoma growth in male and female mice and to determine whether gonadal steroids regulate PTHrP in lung cancer cells.
Tumor PTHrP content was measured by immunoassay, and tumor burden was assessed with multiple measures in BEN squamous cell orthotopic lung carcinomas in athymic mice. In addition, lung adenocarcinoma PTHrP messenger RNA (mRNA) values determined by microarray analyses were compared between men and women. Cultured lung cancer cells were assayed for PTHrP after treatment with estradiol or R1881, a synthetic androgen.
Lung carcinomas contained approximately 3 times more PTHrP in female mice than in male mice. Similarly, levels of PTHrP mRNA were significantly greater in adenocarcinomas from patients who were women than from patients who were men. Male mice had greater tumor burden than female mice. Androgen treatment reduced PTHrP in 3 lung cancer lines. Estradiol had no effect. Testosterone treatment also reduced lung carcinoma PTHrP in female mice.
Lung carcinomas in females expressed more PTHrP than in males possibly because of negative regulation by androgens in males. Female mice with higher tumor PTHrP content had significantly less tumor burden than male mice, supporting the hypothesis that PTHrP inhibits tumor growth.
1. The recovery of the clonidine-induced hypotension, bradycardia and sympatho-inhibition produced by several putative alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists was investigated in pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats. The activity of four substances containing an imidazoline structure: idazoxan, methoxy-idazoxan, BRL44408 and atipamezole was compared with the effect of fluparoxan, yohimbine and L-657,743; in addition the effect of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, was also studied. 2. Prazosin (0.03-1 mg kg-1, i.v.) failed to alter the sympatho-inhibitory and hypotensive effects of clonidine (10 micrograms kg-1, i.v.). L-657,743 (0.01-1 mg kg-1, i.v.) induced a recovery of blood pressure, heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity. Yohimbine (0.03-3 mg kg-1, i.v.) completely reversed the sympatho-inhibitory effect of clonidine but did not alter its hypotensive effect. 3. The four imidazoline drugs: idazoxan (10-300 micrograms kg-1, i.v.), methoxy-idazoxan (1-100 micrograms kg-1, i.v.), BRL44408 (0.1-3 mg kg-1, i.v.) and atipamezole (0.03-1 mg kg-1, i.v.) and fluparoxan (10-300 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) reversed the clonidine-induced hypotension but produced only a partial recovery of the renal sympathetic nerve activity and of the heart rate. After pretreatment with prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v.), the recovery of the sympathetic nerve activity elicited by these compounds was significantly higher. In hexamethonium (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) pretreated rats, these five drugs induced dose-related hypertension which was reduced by pretreatment with prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v.). 4. Our results indicate that the putative alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists idazoxan, methoxy-idazoxan, BRL44408, atipamezole and fluparoxan also have a peripheral hypertensive effect which is mediated through activation of vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors; this property of the compounds may be partly responsible for the reversal of the hypotensive action of clonidine. Considering the structure and the affinities of the drugs tested, our data indirectly suggest that alpha 2A-adrenoceptors may be implicated in the central sympatho-inhibitory effects of clonidine.
Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) induces autoimmunity in Brown Norway (BN) rats, with necrotizing vasculitis in the gut. Circumstantial evidence implicates the Th2 subset of CD4+ T lymphocytes, which produces IL-4. We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to quantify IL-4 gene expression. A phagemid containing rat IL-4 cDNA was modified to act as the template for a synthetic RNA construct; a known amount of synthetic RNA was added to total RNA from spleen and caecum of BN rats at various times after HgCl2, followed by reverse transcriptase PCR. IL-4 gene expression increased markedly in spleen and caecum after HgCl2. Splenic levels peaked by 10 days at approximately five-times baseline, then returned towards normal as the autoimmune response was spontaneously regulated. Caecal IL-4 expression peaked at 48 h, at which time we observed a previously unreported early phase of tissue injury, with necrotizing vasculitis qualitatively similar to that reported previously in the later phases of the model. These data support a key role for IL-4 in this experimental model of autoimmunity. The quantitative PCR technique can be modified for analysis of other cytokines, allowing further investigation of the role of T cell subsets in this model.
Case reports have prompted concern that the use of bromocriptine mesylate to prevent lactation in the puerperium increases the risk of postpartum seizure. We conducted a record-based case-control study of postpartum seizures in three data bases to evaluate this relation. We identified 43 women who had a postpartum seizure, and we matched 319 controls individually by hospital of delivery, quinquenium of age, and time of delivery. Overall, women taking bromocriptine had a 22% lower risk for seizures, that is, the relative risk estimate was 0.78, with a 90% confidence interval of 0.29 to 1.87. A reduction in seizure risk is consistent with reports of antiseizure activity for bromocriptine in various species, including humans. We found a small positive association between bromocriptine use and seizures occurring more than 72 hours after delivery, with a relative risk estimate of 1.6 after controlling for seizure history. This association was offset by a strong negative association between bromocriptine use and early-occurring seizures. The pattern of an initial reduced risk followed by an increase to normal or above-normal levels of risk could result from an antiseizure activity of bromocriptine, with a rebound in risk when bromocriptine is withdrawn.
We report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) whose sample size (1,053 Swedish subjects) is sufficiently powered to detect genome-wide significance (p<1.5 x 10(-7)) for polymorphisms that modestly alter therapeutic warfarin dose. The anticoagulant drug warfarin is widely prescribed for reducing the risk of stroke, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and coronary malfunction. However, Caucasians vary widely (20-fold) in the dose needed for therapeutic anticoagulation, and hence prescribed doses may be too low (risking serious illness) or too high (risking severe bleeding). Prior work established that approximately 30% of the dose variance is explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the warfarin drug target VKORC1 and another approximately 12% by two non-synonymous SNPs (*2, *3) in the cytochrome P450 warfarin-metabolizing gene CYP2C9. We initially tested each of 325,997 GWAS SNPs for association with warfarin dose by univariate regression and found the strongest statistical signals (p<10(-78)) at SNPs clustering near VKORC1 and the second lowest p-values (p<10(-31)) emanating from CYP2C9. No other SNPs approached genome-wide significance. To enhance detection of weaker effects, we conducted multiple regression adjusting for known influences on warfarin dose (VKORC1, CYP2C9, age, gender) and identified a single SNP (rs2108622) with genome-wide significance (p = 8.3 x 10(-10)) that alters protein coding of the CYP4F2 gene. We confirmed this result in 588 additional Swedish patients (p<0.0029) and, during our investigation, a second group provided independent confirmation from a scan of warfarin-metabolizing genes. We also thoroughly investigated copy number variations, haplotypes, and imputed SNPs, but found no additional highly significant warfarin associations. We present power analysis of our GWAS that is generalizable to other studies, and conclude we had 80% power to detect genome-wide significance for common causative variants or markers explaining at least 1.5% of dose variance. These GWAS results provide further impetus for conducting large-scale trials assessing patient benefit from genotype-based forecasting of warfarin dose.
Clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease have shown that transplants of fetal mesencephalic dopamine neurons can form a new functional innervation of the host striatum, but the clinical benefits have been highly variable: some patients have shown substantial recovery in motor function, whereas others have shown no improvement and even a worsening in the 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinetic side effects. Differences in the composition of the grafted cell preparation may contribute to these discrepancies. In particular, the number of serotonin neurons contained in the graft can vary greatly depending on the dissection of the fetal tissue. Importantly, serotonin neurons have the ability to store and release dopamine, formed from exogenously administered L-DOPA. Here, we have evaluated the effect of transplants containing serotonin neurons, or a mixture of dopamine and serotonin neurons, on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals. As expected, dopamine neuron-rich grafts induced functional recovery, accompanied by a 60% reduction in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia that developed gradually over the first 10 weeks. Rats with serotonin-rich grafts with few dopamine neurons, in contrast, showed a progressive worsening of their L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias over time, and no functional improvement. The antidyskinetic effect of dopamine-rich grafts was independent of the number of serotonin neurons present. We conclude that serotonin neurons in the grafts are likely to have a detrimental effect on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in cases in which the grafts contain no or few dopamine neurons.
Forty patients presenting with watery rhinorrhoea as their main complaint were entered in an open trial of long-term intranasal ipratropium bromide. Fourteen of these (35 per cent) found it to be beneficial and completed one year of treatment. Side-effects were seen in 28 patients (70 per cent) but these were local and mild in nature. All resolved during the trial as patients adjusted the dosage to individual severity and frequency of symptoms. No significant systemic effects were noted during the course of therapy. Ipratropium is a useful drug in the treatment of watery rhinorrhoea and appears safe for long-term use.
Studies of bimonthly 48-hour regimens of high-dose leucovorin (LV) (FOLinic acid), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by continuous infusion combined with OXaliplatin (FOLFOX) in pretreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer suggest that oxaliplatin dose intensity is an important prognostic factor for response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). To help define the optimal dose schedule for oxaliplatin in pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer, we retrospectively analyzed data from three phase II studies using different FOLFOX regimens (FOLFOX2, 3 and 6).
Data on 126/161 patients were analyzed. FOLFOX2 included oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2; FOLFOX3, 85 mg/m2; and FOLFOX6, 100 mg/m2 (added to a simplified LV-5-FU regimen), all as two-hour infusions. A total of 47 patients received low dose intensity oxaliplatin (LDI: < or = 85 mg/m2/2 weeks) and 79 patients high dose intensity oxaliplatin (HDI: > 85 mg/m2/2 weeks).
Objective responses occurred in 31 (39%) HDI patients and 9 (19%) LDI patients (P = 0.03). Median PFS was 28 weeks, with 52% of HDI patients progression free at 6 months, and 26 weeks with 36% of LDI patients progression free at six months (P = 0.02). Increased oxaliplatin dose intensity was not associated with increased neurotoxicity or other toxicities. FOLFOX are among the most effective regimens for treating LV-5-FU-resistant metastatic colorectal cancer.
This study shows that oxaliplatin dose intensification significantly improves response rate and PFS in pretreated metastatic disease without increasing severe toxicity.
Severe and often fatal cardiac complications have been reported in cocaine users with narrowed coronary arteries caused by atherosclerosis as well as in young adults with normal coronaries. We have found that in normal dogs cocaine induces severe temporary hypoperfusion of the left ventricle as indicated by a significantly lower 201Tl concentration compared to the baseline state. The most significant decrease in uptake occurred 5 min after injection and was more pronounced in the septal and apical segments. Following intravenous administration of cocaine, instead of gradual disappearance of 201Tl from the left ventricle, there was continuous increase in 201Tl concentration in the left ventricle. These imaging experiments indicate that the deleterious effects of cocaine on the heart are probably due to spasm of the coronaries and decreased myocardial perfusion. Since spasm of the large subpericardial vessels does not seem to explain the magnitude of the increased coronary resistance and decreased coronary flow after cocaine as described in the literature, it is suggested that microvascular spasm of smaller vessels plays a major role in the temporary decrease in perfusion. The data may also suggest that severe temporary myocardial ischemia is probably the initiating factor for the cardiac complications induced by cocaine.
An exploratory trial was conducted to evaluate toxicity and potential therapeutic role of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) given long-term together with chemotherapy and G-CSF to adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
ATRA was administered orally at 45 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-14 and 25 mg/m(2)/day on days 15-28 of two standard cycles (idarubicin, etoposide, cytarabine, G-CSF) and of up to three high-dose courses (cytarabine, G-CSF). The results obtained in 19 patients enrolled in the ATRA trial were compared with those from 29 comparable cases treated with the same schedule without ATRA, according to patient risk class and an in vitro study.
ATRA was administered for a median of 52 days to the patients selected for study who achieved a remission. ATRA-related toxicity was mostly non-severe apart from high incidence of headache in conjunction with high-dose cytarabine. Complete remission (CR) rate after cycle 1 (54%), kinetics of hematological recovery, postremission treatment realization, disease-free survival (DFS 37.5% at three years) and overall survival (30% at three years) were not different between ATRA-treated and untreated patients. The only significant prognostic factor was the patient risk class, as defined by cytogenetics and other clinical criteria: DFS rate was 57% at three years in standard-risk cases compared to only 19% in the high-risk group, with no influx by ATRA in either category. The in vitro study, in patients with a definite clinical response, failed to document any inhibitory or pro-apoptotic effect of ATRA on AML blast cells.
As a consequence to these results, the pilot ATRA phase was closed. This study does not suggest a significant role for the present ATRA schedule as an adjunct to standard antileukemic therapy in adult AML.
We report a case of aortic valve endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecalis highly resistant to gentamicin, which failed to respond to conventional antibiotic combination therapy. Extensive in vitro testing was required to determine an appropriate antimicrobial regimen. Despite bacteriological resolution and cardiac surgery the patient died from complications of infective endocarditis.
Human plasma protein complement factor H (FH) is an inhibitor of the spontaneously activated alternative complement pathway. An allotypic variant of FH, 402His, has been associated with age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Crystals of FH domains 6-8 (FH678) containing 402His have been grown in the presence of a polyanionic sucrose octasulfate ligand (an analogue of the natural glycosaminoglycan ligands of FH) using both native and selenomethionine-derivatized protein. Native data sets diffracting to 2.3 A and SeMet data sets of up to 2.8 A resolution have been collected. An anomalous difference Patterson map reveals self- and cross-peaks from two incorporated Se atoms. The corresponding selenium substructure has been solved.
Increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas, as well as the growth-inhibitory effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in vitro, suggests that NSAIDs may be an effective treatment for pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine is currently the most effective chemotherapeutic drug available for patients with pancreatic cancer, but is only minimally effective against this aggressive disease. Clearly, other treatment options must be identified. To design successful therapeutic strategies involving compounds either alone or in combination with others, it is necessary to understand their mechanism of action. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of three NSAIDs (sulindac, indomethacin, and NS-398) or gemcitabine in two human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, BxPC-3 (COX-2-positive) and PaCa-2 (COX-2-negative), previously shown to be growth-inhibited by these NSAIDs. Effects on cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry or Western blotting. Treatment with NSAIDs or gemcitabine altered the cell cycle phase distribution as well as the expression of multiple cell cycle regulatory proteins in both cell lines, but did not induce substantial levels of apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the combination of the NSAID sulindac or NS-398 with gemcitabine inhibited cell growth to a greater degree than either compound alone. These results indicate that the antiproliferative effects of NSAIDs and gemcitabine in pancreatic tumor cells are primarily due to inhibition of cell cycle progression rather than direct induction of apoptotic cell death, regardless of COX-2 expression. In addition, NSAIDs in combination with gemcitabine may hold promise in the clinic for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Male Fischer-344 rats (n = 38) at 5 months old were tested in a Morris water maze to determine if treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor, phenserine (PHEN), would overcome a learning impairment induced by scopolamine (SCOP), a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist. Each rat was randomly assigned to one of five groups to receive two intraperitoneal injections 60 and 30 min, prior to testing, respectively, as follows: (1) saline-saline (SAL); (2) saline-1.0 mg/kg (SCOP); (3) 2 mg/kg PHEN- SCOP (PHEN2); (4) 4 mg/kg PHEN-SCOP (PHEN4); and (5) 1 mg/kg PHEN-SAL (PHEN1). Maze testing occurred across 5 days with 4 days of acquisition trials (4 trials per day) and a fifth day consisting of a single 120 sec probe trial. PHEN1 and SAL were combined into one control (CON) group for purposes of statistical analysis for both acquisition and probe trials as comparison of the two groups revealed that they did not significantly differ on any measure. SCOP-treated rats were significantly impaired compared to CON in learning the location of the submerged platform as measured by latency to locate the platform and the distance traversed to find the platform across days of testing. The PHEN4 group had significantly lower latencies and traveled a shorter distance to reach the submerged platform when compared to SCOP on the fourth day of trials while the PHEN2 group traveled more directly to the submerged platform but did not have shorter latencies than the SCOP group. For probe trials, CON rats swam closer to the target area (a measure of proximity to the removed platform) than did all other groups, and the PHEN4 group swam in an area more proximate to the target area than did the SCOP-treated group. These findings demonstrate the ability of this drug to improve learning when cholinergic function has been impaired in a spatial memory task.
