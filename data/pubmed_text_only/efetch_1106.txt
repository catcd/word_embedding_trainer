After the Chernobyl accident in 1986, children of the contaminated Narodichesky region of Ukraine were obliged to participate in a yearly medical screening. They have been exposed to 137cesium (137Cs; half-life = 30 years) in contaminated soils, air, and food.
Using a "natural experiment" approach and a longitudinal prospective cohort study design, we investigated the association of soil 137Cs and spirometry measures for 415 children using 1,888 repeated measurements from 1993 to 1998.
Mean baseline village soil 137Cs measurements, which varied from 29.0 to 879 kBq/m2, were used as exposure indicators. A standardized spirometry protocol and prediction equations specific to Ukrainian children were used by the same pulmonologist in all screenings.
Children living in villages with the highest quintile of soil 137Cs were 2.60 times more likely to have forced vital capacity (FVC) < 80% of predicted [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-6.34] and 5.08 times more likely to have a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) to FVC% < 80% (95% CI, 1.02-25.19). We found statistically significant evidence of both airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC%, peak expiratory flow, and maximum expiratory flow at 25%, 50%, and 75% of FVC) and restriction (FVC) with increasing soil 137Cs.
These findings are unique and suggest significant airway obstruction and restriction consequences for children chronically exposed to low-dose radioactive contaminants such as those found downwind of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.
Cholestatic jaundice is the major complication of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in infancy. We have previously shown that the TPN solution is directly toxic to the liver, and that this toxicity appears to be mediated by one or more amino acids. Elevated serum methionine levels, without corresponding increases in its metabolites, suggest that accumulation of this toxic amino acid may cause TPN cholestasis. Nine-week-old rabbits (n = 28) were divided into three groups. The FED group was fed standard rabbit chow ad libitum. The TPN group was not fed and received only i.v. TPN (including methionine 121 mg.kg-1.d-1), and lipids. The EXP group was fed chow ad libitum and received i.v. methionine (121 mg.kg-1.d-1). After 14 d, we evaluated bile flow, bromosulfophthalein excretion, serum liver enzymes, liver histology, and serum amino acid levels. Bile flow was significantly depressed in the TPN and EXP groups compared with FED controls (32.9 +/- 9.4 and 45.7 +/- 14.4 versus 82.9 +/- 13.8). Excretion of the bilirubin analog bromosulfophthalein tended to be delayed by methionine infusion (p = 0.15). Serum liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and alkaline phosphatase) were normal in all groups. Histologic liver injury in the EXP group was similar to that caused by TPN. Balloon degeneration, and portal inflammation were seen in both groups. Homocysteine, an early metabolite of methionine, was elevated in the TPN and EXP groups compared with FED controls. Intravenous methionine is hepatotoxic. Despite full oral feeding, it produces a depression of bile flow and histologic liver injury similar to that seen with TPN. Elevated homocysteine levels suggests an enzymatic block early in the pathway of methionine metabolism. We believe that methionine may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of TPN cholestasis.
Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for which marketing approval has been obtained recently in Germany. The results of several double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that sertraline has a clear antidepressive effect. However these studies have been conducted in outpatient populations. In the context of this multicenter study, a total of 160 inpatients were treated with sertraline 50-150 mg or amitriptyline 75-225 mg over a period of 6 weeks in a double-blind fashion. Sixty-two patients in the sertraline and 59 patients in the amitriptyline group were evaluated for efficacy in the according-to-protocol (ATP) population; 80 sertraline and 75 amitriptyline patients were evaluated for safety in the Intention-to-treat population (ITT). No statistically significant differences were detected between the two groups in the efficacy analysis performed on the basis of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) total score and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Due to its sedating properties, amitriptyline was found to be significantly more effective with regard to the HAM-D factor "sleep disturbance". The safety analysis, which was based on the CGI, the global assessment at the end of study and a score for somatic adverse events (FSUCL) revealed statistically significant advantages of sertraline over amitriptyline. Amitriptyline was associated with more autonomic and circulatory side effects, while epigastric complaints occurred more often with sertraline. The incidence of nausea - a typical SSRI side effect - was the same in both groups.
Rhinitis is common, but the risk factors are not well described. To investigate the association between current rhinitis and pesticide use, we used data from 2245 Iowa commercial pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study.
Using logistic regression models adjusted for age, education and growing up on a farm, we evaluated the association between current rhinitis and 34 pesticides used in the past year.
74% of commercial pesticide applicators reported at least one episode of rhinitis in the past year (current rhinitis). Five pesticides used in the past year were significantly positively associated with current rhinitis: the herbicides 2,4-D, glyphosate and petroleum oil, the insecticide diazinon and the fungicide benomyl. The association for 2,4-D and glyphosate was limited to individuals who used both in the past year (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.77). Both petroleum oil and diazinon showed consistent evidence of an association with rhinitis, based on both current use and exposure-response models. We saw no evidence of confounding by common agricultural rhinitis triggers such as handling grain or hay.
Exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of rhinitis.
Colon cancer is one of the serious health problems in most developed countries and its incidence rate is increasing in India. Hesperetin (HN) (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavonone) and hesperetin analogue (HA) were tested for their apoptosis inducing ability. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay revealed a dose as well as duration-dependent reduction of HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma) cellular growth in response to HN and HA treatment. At 24 h 70 μM of HN and 32 μM of HA showed 50% reduction of HT-29 cellular growth. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining showed apoptotic features of cell death induced by HN and HA. Rhodamine 123 staining showed significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by HN and HA. HN and HA induced DNA damage was confirmed by comet tail formation. Lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS) and protein oxidation marker (PCC) were significantly elevated in HN and HA treated groups. Enzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were slightly decreased in their activities compared to control (untreated HT-29 cells). Results of Western blot analysis of apoptosis associated genes revealed an increase in cytochrome C, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression. These findings indicate that HN and HA induce apoptosis on HT-29 via Bax dependent mitochondrial pathway involving oxidant/antioxidant imbalance.
Premature uterine contractions were treated by intravenous beta-mimetics in 190 patients during a 2-year period. History and physical examination were directed toward identification of patients with cardiac problems. Unexpected cardiac pathology was discovered in 14 patients, all of whom exhibited severe and continuous nausea, retrosternal pain, or dyspnea during beta-mimetic administration. Treatment was immediately discontinued in the presence of S-T depression, supraventricular tachycardia, nonspecific T wave changes, and sinus tachycardia with right axis deviation. Further investigation revealed obstructive cardiac myopathy in one case and atrial septal defect in another. Such changes might be identified earlier by more extensive screening procedures (such as electrocardiogram) before drug administration. Administration of beta-mimetic agents may uncover previously unexpected cardiac pathology. Continuation of ritodrine in such cases is contraindicated and potentially hazardous.
Twenty-one patients (15 women, 6 men) with definite multiple sclerosis (MS) were treated with 1000 mg intravenous methylprednisolone-succinate (MP) daily for 10 days. Before MP treatment there was a negative correlation (r = 0.59, P = 0.0084) between serum vitamin B12 and progression rate, defined as the ratio of the score on Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale and disease duration. A significant decrease was demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of folate and in the CSF level of vitamin B12 after MP treatment. The decrease in serum B12 was not statistically significant. After MP treatment all median levels of vitamin B12 and folate were below the reference medians. We hypothesize that low or reduced vitamin B12/folate levels found in MS patients may be related to previous corticosteroid treatments. Otherwise a more causal relationship between low vitamin B12/folate and MS cannot be excluded. Further studies may be required to clarify the vitamin B12 and folate metabolism in patients with MS.
Ten patients with typical angina pectoris and without hypertension, congestive heart failure or other disease were treated with alternating four-week courses of metoprolol (alpha beta1 cardioselective beta-blocking agent), propranolol and placebo. Midway through each four-week period, drug dosage was doubled; thus, regimes were metoprolol, 150 and 300 mg/day, propranolol, 120 and 240 mg per day and placebo, 3 and 6 tablets per day. Serum concentrations of metoprolol increased with increasing dosage in a proportion very similar to that seen with propranolol. Statistically significant reductions in angina frequency/nitroglycerin consumption, and statistically significant increases in total work performed on a bicycle ergometer, were found with both active compounds when compared with placebo. No significant differences were noted between the two active compounds. Though most patients showed greatest improvement on the higher of the two drug dosages, three patients with metoprolol and two with propranolol responded best on the lower dose regime. Both compounds reduced heart rate at rest and during exercise. Neither reduced arterial pressure at rest, but both reduced arterial pressure during exercise. It is concluded that metoprolol is as effective as propranolol in the reduction of angina attacks and improvement in exercise tolerance during chronic therapy in patients with uncomplicated angina pectoris. It is now appropriate to study the effects of metoprolol in patients with coronary artery disease in whom the harmful effects of non-selective beta-blockade heretofore have precluded optimal therapy with beta-blocking drugs.
Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenic patients whose symptoms do not respond to traditional antipsychotic drugs. The emergence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment of clozapine has been reported in some case studies. We report on the case of a 31-year old man with chronic schizophrenia who had shown obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment with clozapine.
A 31-year old patient with treatment refractory schizophrenia was treated with clozapine. During clozapine treatment, positive symptomatology decreased, but after 4 months after starting clozapine the patient showed obsessive and compulsive symptoms. This symptomatology had previously not been a feature of this patient's illness.
Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were observed during treatment of clozapine in a schizophrenic patient. This may be explained either by the serotonin-receptor antagonism of clozapine or its atypical dopaminergic receptor effects.
The therapeutic benefit of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in treating cholestatic liver disease is globally recognized. It is generally accepted that the mechanism of action of UDCA can be attributed to several diverse processes that appear to be uniformly targeted towards minimizing the deleterious actions of accumulated hydrophobic bile acids in the cholestatic liver. Since hydrophobic bile acids are prooxidants, emerging in vitro evidence suggests that UDCA may have an antioxidant mechanism of action. We hypothesize that UDCA suppresses the extent of lipid peroxidation in the cholestatic liver. This hypothesis was tested by assessing the extent of lipid peroxidation in livers harvested from chronic bile duct ligated (CBDL) rats dosed daily for 24 days with 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg UDCA. The extent of lipid peroxidation was evaluated by determining the hepatic content of conjugated dienes, lipid peroxides, and malondialdehyde. The data were compared with identical data collected from unoperated control and 24-day bile duct manipulated (SO) rats. In the two groups of control rats, UDCA has no effect on the serum indices of liver function. In CBDL rats, UDCA suppressed the increased extent of lipid peroxidation in the liver in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of improvement of laboratory parameters of liver function and hepatic architecture. In conclusion, UDCA suppresses the augmented extent of lipid peroxidation in the diseased liver of CBDL rats.
1. Perindopril's effectiveness in mild to moderate hypertension was evaluated in three studies. 2. Perindopril was more effective than sodium restriction in reducing blood pressure, and the effects were additive. 3. Perindopril was as effective as atenolol in reducing blood pressure, and was well tolerated. 4. Perindopril lowered blood pressure to the same extent as enalapril at peak drug levels but had a greater effect at the trough level of the drugs. 5. Perindopril is an effective antihypertensive agent with an acceptable side-effect profile in people with hypertension.
We treated a patient who intentionally overdosed with theophylline complicated by metabolic disturbances. Management of the patient's hypokalemia with moderate doses of potassium chloride resulted in hyperkalemia with associated electrocardiographic changes. The rapid clearance of theophylline due to the administration of oral activated charcoal was believed to be a contributing factor. It is likely that theophylline-induced hypokalemia is due to intracellular sequestration of potassium and that as the theophylline level decreases potassium will reequilibrate out of the cell. The case provides support for the conservative management of metabolite abnormalities associated with theophylline overdose.
Muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the M5 subtype are expressed by dopamine-containing neurons of the ventral tegmentum. These M5 receptors modulate the activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which play an important role in mediating reinforcing properties of abused psychostimulants like cocaine. The potential role of M5 receptors in the reinforcing effects of cocaine was investigated using M5 receptor-deficient mice in a model of acute cocaine self-administration. The M5-deficient mice self-administered cocaine at a significantly lower rate than wild-type controls. In the conditioned place preference procedure, a classic test for evaluating the rewarding properties of drugs, M5-deficient mice spent significantly less time in the cocaine-paired compartment than control mice. Moreover, the severity of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome (withdrawal-associated anxiety measured in the elevated plus-maze) was significantly attenuated in mice lacking the M5 receptor. These results demonstrate that M5 receptors play an important role in mediating both cocaine-associated reinforcement and withdrawal.
The pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of an oral loading dose of carbamazepine administered in tablet or suspension form were studied. Patients on a hospital epilepsy unit who were to receive carbamazepine as a discharge medication were randomly assigned to receive either an oral 8-mg/kg loading dose of the tablet formulation or the same dose of the suspension on an empty stomach. Blood samples were drawn before and at intervals up to 12 hours after the loading dose. Adverse effects were evaluated subjectively and objectively. Total and free serum carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide (CBZE) concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Six adult patients were enrolled in and completed the study. All the patients achieved therapeutic total carbamazepine levels; the suspension group did so within two hours and the tablet group within five hours. Maximum serum carbamazepine concentrations ranged from 7.10 to 9.92 mg/L, area under the concentration-versus-time curve from 54.85 to 82.23 micrograms.hr/L, and terminal elimination half-life from 14.05 to 15.71 hours. Adverse effects were mild, few, and short-lived; none of the patients developed gastrointestinal toxicity. Adverse effects were not associated with total or free carbamazepine and CBZE concentrations or with total or free CBZE:carbamazepine ratios. An oral loading dose of carbamazepine 8 mg/kg achieved therapeutic levels within two hours when given as a suspension and within five hours when given as tablets and was well tolerated in all patients.
Intermittent and concomitant acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy was superimposed onto a 21-day regimen with diflunisal 250 mg b.i.d. Low doses of ASA (600 mg single dose or 300 mg q.i.d.) did not influence signficantly diflunisal blood levels whereas a 600 mg q.i.d. dosing caused a small significant drop, especially at trough level. This drop is not expected to be clinically significant. No ototoxicity could be demonstrated with any treatment of diflunisal though four of fourteen subjects reported mild tinnitus during concomitant therapy at the higher doses of ASA. Diflunisal at 375 mg b.i.d. failed to alter the metabolism of a single dose of labelled ASA (600 mg) as judged by plasma levels, urinary excretion and plasma binding. Daily urinary excretion of prostaglandins E1 and E2 major metabolite was decreased by about 70% by diflunisal.
The authors report three cases of Raynaud phenomenon that developed during doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vincristine (ABV) therapy for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi sarcoma. Although Raynaud phenomenon is well documented as a side effect of bleomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin chemotherapy for germ cell neoplasms, it has not been widely documented in patients with AIDS.
To study the mechanism of Corydyceps polysaccharide (CP) actions against liver fibrosis.
SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, DMN-induced liver fibrosis model group and CP treated group. Model group and CP group were injected intraperitonealy with 0. 5% dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) at dose of 2 mL x kg(-1) for 4 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. Then the later group was orally taken CP for 4 weeks. Liver tissue hydroxyproline (Hyp) content was determined by Jamall's method. The liver serum of ALT and AST activities, level of albumin and total bilirubin were analyzed The liver collagen deposition and were observed with Masson' collagen stains. In addition,the tissue inhibitor of metallprteinase-2 (TIMMP-2) level, metalloproteinade-2 (MMP-2) activity, type IV collagen content were observed. Liver samples were also analyzed malondiadehyde (MDA)level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity.
Compare with model group, CP improved the hepatic function (ALT, AST, Alb and Tbil). There were significant decreased of MDA content in CP group, SOD of CP group were markedly increased. Compared to those of normal control group, Hyp content, IV collagen content, TIMMP-2 level in liver tissue of model group increase significantly, and MMP-2 activity decreased, while CP decrees these pathological increase at different degrees.
CP exerts rather good action against liver fibrosis, and with the mechanism relating to improve degradation of the deposited collagens and anti-lipid peroxiation.
Phenelzine associated sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy is reported in two patients. Symptoms were predominantly sensory, and improvement occurred after withdrawal of phenelzine. Electrophysiologic findings were consistent with an axonal process.
Cardiovascular toxicity represents one of the major reasons for the termination of the development of drugs, even in late development phases. This growing issue is often not restricted to specific therapeutic areas, and it is gaining critical importance, in particular for chronically administered drugs, highlighting the limitations in terms of sensitivity of the current investigational paradigms. Furthermore, drug-related changes may become evident after long-term administration for different reasons, including accumulation of the drug in the heart. This article describes how the integrated use of investigational tools represents a powerful approach for the early identification and characterization of cardiotoxicity in preclinical development. Cardiac changes were observed in the dog after long-term oral administration of casopitant, a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, developed for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Different approaches and sensitive biomarkers were used in a time-course study to investigate the onset, progression, and reversibility of the lesion. The integrated evaluation of cardiovascular parameters, electron microscopy, troponin I, and natriuretic peptide results highlighted any minimal early changes, allowing the full and deep characterization of the lesion. The outcome of this study was the driver for drug development decision making on casopitant and backup drugs.
Acute decompensating cardiomyopathy induced by cyclophosphamide is usually irreversible. To investigate the clinical course and the outcome of therapy, 13 patients (1.7%) with grade III acute cardiomyopathy and hypotension who were treated with ablative transplant regimens between January 1980 and September 1995 were analyzed. Eight of nine patients died of acute fatal restrictive cardiomyopathy with unresponsive hypotension (ARCH), whereas three of four patients who survived the initial episode died of subacute congestive heart failure (SCHF). Acute fatal restrictive cardiomyopathy was characterized with extreme sensitivity to volume overload, myocardial edema and a rapidly fatal course. It was associated with progressive, unresponsive hypotension, reduced left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI: 29.29 +/- 9.74 g-m/beat/m2) and markedly reduced systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance indices (SVRI: 429.72 +/- 168.84, PVRI: 58.63 +/- 45.08 dyne.sec/cm5.m2). Subacute CHF was identified by myocardial edema, dilated chambers and biventricular pump failure represented by decreases in fractional shortening (FS: 19.5 +/- 4.9%). Of 10 patients who received conventional therapy, nine died and one sustained chronic CHF. One of three patients with ARCH on antioxidant therapy of ascorbic acid and theophylline survived the episode. The data suggests peripheral vascular collapse may also be responsible for fatal ARCH.
New medications have lessened the need for narcotic medications in the acute treatment of migraine. Some of these new medications include parenteral dihydroergotamine (DHE), sumatriptan, and ketorolac. Treatment failures still occur, though, and some cases necessitate adding a second agent to one that has been ineffective. We report a case of a 46-year-old man who suffered renal papillary necrosis 12 days after receiving parenteral DHE, sumatriptan, and ketorolac for treatment of a severe migraine headache. There were no signs of an adverse drug reaction at the time of his emergency department visit. The case illustrates a potential hazard of this combination in the acute treatment of migraine.
Following subcutaneous therapy with heparin, the patient developed signs and symptoms of vascular occlusion in both legs. This was accompanied by thrombocytopenia and platelet aggregation when the patient's platelets were incubated with heparin. The clinical features and implications of this syndrome are discussed.
The rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis around the world, including in industrialized nations, poses a great threat to human health and defines a need to develop new, effective and inexpensive anti-tubercular agents. Previously we developed a chemical systems biology approach to identify off-targets of major pharmaceuticals on a proteome-wide scale. In this paper we further demonstrate the value of this approach through the discovery that existing commercially available drugs, prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, have the potential to treat MDR and XDR tuberculosis. These drugs, entacapone and tolcapone, are predicted to bind to the enzyme InhA and directly inhibit substrate binding. The prediction is validated by in vitro and InhA kinetic assays using tablets of Comtan, whose active component is entacapone. The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC(99)) of entacapone for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) is approximately 260.0 microM, well below the toxicity concentration determined by an in vitro cytotoxicity model using a human neuroblastoma cell line. Moreover, kinetic assays indicate that Comtan inhibits InhA activity by 47.0% at an entacapone concentration of approximately 80 microM. Thus the active component in Comtan represents a promising lead compound for developing a new class of anti-tubercular therapeutics with excellent safety profiles. More generally, the protocol described in this paper can be included in a drug discovery pipeline in an effort to discover novel drug leads with desired safety profiles, and therefore accelerate the development of new drugs.
Raloxifene (RAL) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator presenting tissue-specific agonist activity. The aim of this study was to examine whether RAL has an estrogenic effect on carrageenan-induced acute inflammation. Adult female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) 7 wk before edema or pleurisy to deplete circulating estrogens. Edema formation and selected inflammatory markers in inflamed paw tissue were measured in intact (sham-operated) and OVX rats. Groups of OVX rats were treated with RAL (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) or 17beta-estradiol (E2, 25 microg/kg), and these treatments began 2 d after surgery and continued until carrageenan paw edema or pleurisy. Ovariectomy amplifies the inflammation, and we found that RAL, as well as E2, attenuates inflammation and tissue damage associated with paw edema and pleurisy. In treated rats, there is a decrease in edema development and formation, and in polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and migration, as shown by myeloperoxidase measurement and cell counting. RAL and E2 treatments decrease cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in inflamed areas and counteract the inhibition of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma expression caused by ovariectomy, restoring this receptor protein expression to sham-operated levels and identifying a possible peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-dependent antiinflammatory effect of these drugs. Moreover, RAL and E2 increase cytoprotective heat shock protein 72 expression, which seems to be closely associated with the remission of the inflammatory reaction. In addition, we confirm the antiinflammatory effect of RAL in male rats, using a single administration of RAL or E2.
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is upregulated by hypoxia and oncogenic signalling in many solid tumours. Its regulation and function in thyroid carcinomas are unknown. We evaluated the regulation of HIF-1 alpha and target gene expression in primary thyroid carcinomas and thyroid carcinoma cell lines (BcPAP, WRO, FTC-133 and 8505c). HIF-1 alpha was not detectable in normal tissue but was expressed in thyroid carcinomas. Dedifferentiated anaplastic tumours (ATCs) exhibited high levels of nuclear HIF-1 alpha staining. The HIF-1 target glucose transporter 1 was expressed to a similar level in all tumour types, whereas carbonic anhydrase-9 was significantly elevated in ATCs. In vitro studies revealed a functionally active HIF-1 alpha pathway in thyroid cells with transcriptional activation observed after graded hypoxia (1% O(2), anoxia) or treatment with a hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride. High basal and hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1 alpha in FTC-133 cells that harbour a phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) mutation was reduced by introduction of wild-type PTEN. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway using LY294002 inhibited HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 alpha targets in all cell lines, including those with B-RAF mutations (BcPAP and 8505c). In contrast, the effects of inhibition of the RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway were restricted by environmental condition and B-RAF mutation status. HIF-1 is functionally expressed in thyroid carcinomas and is regulated not only by hypoxia but also via growth factor signalling pathways and, in particular, the PI3K pathway. Given the strong association of HIF-1 alpha with an aggressive disease phenotype and therapeutic resistance, this pathway may be an attractive target for improved therapy in thyroid carcinomas.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the deadliest tumors afflicting humans, and the mechanisms of its onset and progression remain largely undefined. Our attempts to elucidate its molecular pathogenesis through DNA copy-number analysis by genome-wide digital karyotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays identified a dramatic focal amplification on chromosome 1q32 in 4 of 57 GBM tumors. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements revealed that HDMX is the most commonly amplified and overexpressed gene in the 1q32 locus. Further genetic screening of 284 low- and high-grade gliomas revealed that HDMX amplifications occur solely in pediatric and adult GBMs and that they are mutually exclusive of TP53 mutations and MDM2 amplifications. Here, we demonstrate that HDMX regulates p53 to promote GBM growth and attenuates tumor response to chemotherapy. In GBM cells, HDMX overexpression inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional activation of p21, releases cells from G0 to G1 phase, and enhances cellular proliferation. HDMX overexpression does not affect the expression of PUMA and BAX proapoptotic genes. While in GBM cells treated with the chemotherapeutic agent 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), HDMX appears to stabilize p53 and promote phosphorylation of the DNA double-stranded break repair protein H2AX, up-regulate the DNA repair gene VPX, stimulate DNA repair, and confer resistance to BCNU. In summary, HDMX exhibits bona fide oncogenic properties and offers a promising molecular target for GBM therapeutic intervention.
In postmyocardial infarction patients longterm aspirin treatment with 1.5 g/day led to a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 6 months. This could not be found in the placebo- and the phenprocoumon-treated patients. After one year the blood pressure behaviour was the same in all three treatment groups. As nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs can produce hypertension in animals, probably due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, blood pressure control in longterm aspirin treatment is advisable.
