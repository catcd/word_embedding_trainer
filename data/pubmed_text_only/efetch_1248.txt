Exposure to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) during pregnancy causes severe defects in mammary gland development and function; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Alterations in epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during pregnancy-related mammary development can lead to failed lactogenesis. To determine which of these processes are affected and at what time periods, we examined proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in mammary glands following exposure to TCDD during early, mid or throughout pregnancy. Although AhR activation throughout pregnancy did not cause early involution, there was a 50% decrease in cell proliferation, which was observed as early as the sixth day of pregnancy (DP). TCDD treatment on the day of impregnation only reduced development and proliferation in early and mid-pregnancy, followed by partial recovery by DP17. However, when AhR activation was delayed to DP7, developmental impairment was not observed in mid-pregnancy, but became evident by DP17, whereas proliferation was reduced at all times. Thus, early exposure to TCDD was neither necessary nor sufficient to cause persistent defects in lactogenesis. These varying outcomes in mammary development due to exposure at different times in pregnancy suggest there are critical windows during which AhR activation impairs mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.
Achieving recommended cholesterol and triglyceride targets for the prevention of cardiovascular events is difficult and frequently requires the use of >1 lipid-lowering medication. This study evaluated the tolerability and effectiveness of combination regimens in high-risk dyslipidemic patients resistant to monotherapy. A retrospective chart review of all patients referred to a cardiovascular risk reduction clinic over a 7.5-year period identified 136 patients who received combination therapy with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) plus fibrate (n = 106) or a statin plus niacin (n = 30) regimen. During follow-up (mean 18.5 months), 28 patients (20.6%) discontinued combination therapy: 11 (8.1%) experienced myalgia with or without elevated creatine kinase, 3 had gastrointestinal upset, and 1 had asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. No patient had combination therapy discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Medications were stopped in 8 patients for reasons other than reported adverse effects or biochemical abnormalities, and 5 patients were switched to alternate monotherapy. Mean percent change from baseline to treatment with combination therapy for total cholesterol (-35%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-37%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+23%), triglycerides (-62%), and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (-41%) were all statistically significant (p <0.01). These results demonstrate that combination statin-fibrate and statin-niacin regimens are safe and effective in managing dyslipidemias in most patients at risk for cardiovascular events who are inadequately treated with one of these agents alone.
Fifty-two patients (51 males, one female) of alcohol dependence/abuse diagnosed according to DSM 111 R1 were registered for disulfiram treatment and were admitted for a 4-week period. No alcohol challenge test was given during their hospital stay. Disulfiram tablets were administered 250 mg twice daily after food. After one week's hospital stay with disulfiram therapy they were sent home to be followed up initially after 15 days and later on once a month. Six male patients developed psychotic symptoms. All of them had shown a mood disorder but no thought disorder was observed. Psychotic symptoms remitted completely after withdrawing disulfiram and then a short course of antipsychotic therapy was given, except in one patient who had to be given lithium for remission of symptoms.
Cocaine-related myocardial infarction is a well-known phenomenon. Concurrent heroin use can mask signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction. We discuss an unusual presentation of myocardial infarction, associated with both cocaine and heroin ("speedball") self-injection, that initially went undiagnosed.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of glycyrrhizin (200 mg/kg/day) on renal function in association with the regulation of aquaporin 2 water channel in rats with gentamicin (100 mg/kg/day)-induced acute renal failure. Polyuria in rats with gentamicin-induced acute renal failure was associated with down-regulation of renal aquaporin 2 in the inner and outer renal medulla, and cortex. Glycyrrhizin administration restored the expression of aquaporin 2 with paralleled changes in urine output. Changes in renal functional parameters, such as creatinine clearance, urinary osmolality, and solute-free reabsorption, accompanying acute renal failure were also partially restored after administration of glycyrrhizin. Histological changes in rats with gentamicin-induced acute renal failure were also abrogated by glycyrrhizin treatment. The above results suggest that glycyrrhizin treatment could ameliorate renal defects in rats with acute renal failure induced by gentamicin.
Combination of low-dose aspirin and modified-release dipyridamole (ASA+MR-DP) provides a significantly increased benefit in stroke prevention over aspirin alone. However, headaches were reported in more patients receiving dipyridamole-containing agents than in those receiving placebo. We undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate which dosing regimens of ASA+MR-DP have better tolerance.
This trial randomized 146 patients with a history of ischemic cerebrovascular disease into three groups: placebo (days 1-28), reduced dose (placebo on days 1-4, ASA+MR-DP once daily before bed during days 5-14, and b.i.d. on days 15-28), and regular dose (placebo on days 1-4, and ASA+MR-DP b.i.d. on days 5-28). Using Chinese diary card, headache was assessed as mean cumulated headache (Sigma frequency x intensity/occurrence days x study days) over the study period, and was graded 0-4 according to Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0.
Intent-to-treat patients after randomization was 46 in placebo group, 45, reduced dose, and 49, regular dose. Among commonly reported adverse effects, headache of any grade occurred significantly more in the regular dose group (38.8%), as compared to the other two groups (p < 0.05). Mean cumulated headache was higher (p < 0.05) in the regular dose group than in the reduced group during days 5-14. Of 27 patients who dropped out, 15 (55.6%) were due to headache, which was substantially more in regular dose (8, 53.3%), though the difference was statistically insignificant.
Initial reduced dose treatment with ASA+MR-DP may cause fewer headaches than regular dosing, and seems better tolerated by those susceptible to phosphodiesterase inhibitor-induced headache.
Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is a potent and broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent prescribed for the treatment of a variety of cancers, including both solid tumours and leukaemias. Unfortunately, despite its broad effectiveness, long-term therapy with doxorubicin is associated with a high incidence of a cumulative and irreversible dilated cardiomyopathy. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to account for this toxicity. Although there is general consensus that doxorubicin undergoes redox cycling to generate free radicals that are responsible for mediating the various cytopathologies associated with drug exposure, the source and subcellular targets continue to be debated. This short review provides a synopsis of the evidence implicating cardiac mitochondria as key intracellular targets, both as sites of generation of highly reactive free radical intermediates as well as targets for the interference with cell calcium regulation and bioenergetic failure that are hallmarks of doxorubicin-induced cardiac failure.
Prostate cancer is associated with defective DNA strand break repair after DNA damage leading to genetic instability and prostate cancer progression. The ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) gene product is known to play an important role in cell cycle regulation and maintenance of genomic integrity. We investigated whether the prevalence of the ATM missense substitution P1054R is increased in a hospital-based series of prostate cancer patients and whether carriers are at increased risk for treatment-related side effects.
A consecutive series of 261 patients treated for early-stage prostate cancer with I-125 brachytherapy (permanent seed implantation) between 10/2000 and 04/2006 at our institution and a comparison group of 460 male control individuals were screened for the presence of the P1054R variant. Outcome of therapy regarding morbidity was assessed prospectively and compared between carriers vs. non-carriers with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), a Quality-of-Life-index (QoL) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) with its subgroups (IIEF-5 and EF).
The proportion of carriers of the P1054R variant was significantly higher among prostate cancer patients than in the general population (25 out of 261 vs. 22 out of 460; OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.8, p<0.01). A subgroup of the carriers additionally harboured the ATM missense variant F858L that was associated with a similar risk (OR=2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.6; p=0.03). After a mean follow-up of 18 months there were no statistically significant differences regarding IPSS (p=0.48), QoL (p=0.61), IIEF-15 score (p=0.78), IIEF-5 score (p=0.83), and EF score (p=0.80), respectively.
The ATM missense variant P1054R confers an about twofold increased risk for prostate cancer in our series. The subgroup of patients with the second-site variant F858L is not at significantly higher risk. After 18 months, there was no evidence for an increased adverse radiotherapy response in P1054R carriers.
The combination of tenofovir and didanosine results in an increase in the didanosine plasma exposure and might augment the risk for didanosine toxicity. Although pharmacokinetic studies support a didanosine dose reduction to 250 mg when used concurrently with tenofovir in patients weighing at least 60 kg, no data are available in lower-weight patients. We describe a case of lactic acidosis and acute liver failure in a low-weight patient receiving tenofovir and a reduced dose of didanosine (200 mg/day). To our knowledge, this is the first case of severe toxicity associated with a reduced dose schedule of didanosine. Previous cases of severe toxicity associated with the combination of tenofovir and didanosine are reviewed.
To evaluate the effect of acetaminophen pretreatment and growth factors on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in cultured rat hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes in primary culture were exposed to acetaminophen 8 mM after pretreatment with either acetaminophen 1 mM, treatment with growth factors (EGF and HGF), or no treatment. Growth response was measured by changes in DNA, [3H]thymidine incorporation and mRNA of growth related proteins, cell damage by leakage of LDH to the medium and changes in ATP, and protection against toxicity by changes in glutathione, cytochrome p450 and the expression of glutathione-S-transferase and Cyp1A2. Pretreatment with acetaminophen induced growth response, weaker than that of growth factors, but pretreatment and growth factors reduced cell damage equally effectively. Glutathione and glutathione-S-transferase increased more by growth factors than by pretreatment, but both conditions reduced Cyp1A2 to near zero. Pretreatment and growth factors protect against acetaminophen toxicity by suppressing the expression of Cyp1A2, thereby reducing the production of the intermediate N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Suppression of Cyp1A2 expression by pretreatment is assumed to be due to a growth-stimulating effect of low concentrations of acetaminophen.
2-Methoxyoestradiol (2-MeOE2) is an endogenous oestrogen metabolite that inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro, and it is also antiangiogenic. In vivo 2-MeOE2, when administered at relatively high doses, inhibits the growth of tumours derived from breast cancer cells, sarcomas and melanomas. Sulphamoylated derivatives of 2-MeOE2 are more potent inhibitors of in vitro breast cancer cell growth than 2-MeOE2. In the present study, we have compared the pharmacokinetic profiles and metabolism of 2-MeOE2 and its sulphamoylated derivative, 2-methoxyoestradiol-bis-sulphamate (2-MeOE2bisMATE), in adult female rats. Their ability to inhibit tumour growth was compared in nude mice bearing xenografts derived from MDA-MB-435 (oestrogen receptor negative) melanoma cancer cells. After a single oral 10 mg kg(-1) dose of 2-MeOE2bisMATE, significant concentrations of this compound were still detectable at 24 h. In contrast, no 2-MeOE2 or metabolites were detected in plasma at any time after a 10 mg kg(-1) oral dose. Thus, the bioavailability of 2-MeOE2 is very low, whereas for 2-MeOE2bisMATE it was 85%. No significant metabolites of 2-MeOE2bisMATE were detected in plasma after oral or intravenous dosing, showing that this drug is resistant to metabolism. In the tumour efficacy model, oral administration of 2-MeOE2bisMATE, at 20 mg kg(-1) day(-1) daily for 28 days, almost completely inhibited tumour growth. Inhibition of tumour growth was maintained for a further 28 days after the cessation of dosing. At this dose level, 2-MeOE2 did not inhibit tumour growth. The resistance to metabolism shown by 2-MeOE2bisMATE and its ability to inhibit tumour growth in vivo suggest that this compound should have considerable potential for development as a novel anticancer drug.
A 27-year-old man developed acute myocardial infarction after intravenous amphetamine use. A coronary angiogram showed plaques in the mid-portion of the left anterior descending artery which developed coronary artery spasm after administration of intracoronary ergonovine. The findings in this case suggest that these coronary artery plaques played a role in the endothelial dysfunction resulting from amphetamine use, and that induction of coronary arterial spasm was the likely mechanism of amphetamine-related acute myocardial infarction.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the discovery of several susceptibility loci for leprosy with robust evidence, providing biological insight into the role of host genetic factors in mycobacterial infection. However, the identified loci only partially explain disease heritability, and additional genetic risk factors remain to be discovered. We performed a 3-stage GWAS of leprosy in the Chinese population using 8,313 cases and 16,017 controls. Besides confirming all previously published loci, we discovered six new susceptibility loci, and further gene prioritization analysis of these loci implicated BATF3, CCDC88B and CIITA-SOCS1 as new susceptibility genes for leprosy. A systematic evaluation of pleiotropic effects demonstrated a high tendency for leprosy susceptibility loci to show association with autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. Further analysis suggests that molecular sensing of infection might have a similar pathogenic role across these diseases, whereas immune responses have discordant roles in infectious and inflammatory diseases.
CNS-involvement in Coxiella burnetii infection is rare. Severe cerebellar symptoms with incomplete restitution were observed in 3 patients who developed Q-fever pneumonia associated with a long-term prophylaxis with lithium for manic-depressive disorder. Several pathophysiological mechanisms for these complications are discussed and a specific toxic-infectious interaction is suggested.
We report a case of a 33 years old female with a history of paroxystic hemidystonia treated by acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI), and who developed two years after the initiation of this treatment bilateral radio-opaque stones. Laboratory tests revealed a hyperchloremic acidosis, an elevated urinary pH, a hypercalciuria, a severe hypocitraturia and numerous granulations of amorphous carbonated calcium phosphates and brushite crystals on urinary microscopic examination, the whole suggests a diagnosis of acetazolamide-induced nephrolithiasis. We discuss in this article the lithogenetic process and the usual composition of the stones induced by CAI, and specific risk factors for developing drug-induced lithiasis which should be taken into consideration when prescribing long-term drug regimens.
A total of 216 aortofemoral angiograms were performed on 72 patients being triple-injected with different contrast media. The characteristics of the contrast media being studied with relation to injection pain included the anionic component, the cationic component, and osmolality. A double-blind study was carried out with neither the examiner nor the patient being aware of the specific contrast medium being injected. The patients were then questioned as to which contrast agent was most painful. There was a significantly lower incidence of severe injection pain with pure meglumines and contrast media with low osmolality. Variation of the anionic component did not improve injection pain.
The oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CPT) produces beneficial hemodynamic and clinical responses in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Cardiac output and stroke volume increase, along with a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, indicating improved left ventricular function. During maintenance CPT therapy, the beneficial hemodynamic and clinical effects appear to be sustained. Improved left ventricular pump function with CPT is associated with decreased metabolic cost, as myocardial oxygen consumption consistently decreases in proportion to the decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. Myocardial ischemia occurs infrequently, as is evident from the abnormal myocardial lactate metabolism. Hypotension appears to be the major adverse effect, particularly after the first dose. However, with dose titration and the use of a smaller initial dose, a marked precipitous fall in blood pressure can be avoided in the majority of patients. Thus, CPT may prove to be a useful agent in the vasodilator therapy of chronic CHF.
A 55-year-old Japanese man was hospitalized for palpitations and severe chest oppression one hour after he ingested about 1500 ml of beer and sildenafil (Viagra) 50 mg. At 43 years of age, he had been diagnosed with intermittent WPW syndrome following a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) attack. He took a 1 mg tablet of doxazosin daily for mild hypertension. On admission, his blood pressure was 90/54 mmHg and his heart beat was weak and irregular with a rate of about 220/min. Since atrial fibrillation (Af) was diagnosed on an electrocardiogram (minimum RR interval; 0.22 seconds), direct current shock was performed with 100 joules and 150 joules but conversion to sinus rhythm failed. Sinus rhythm returned spontaneously from Af four hours after taking sildenafil. Since blood pressure was 50/17 mmHg despite the return to sinus rhythm, blood pressure was maintained by dopamine for twelve hours after sinus rhythm returned. The patient underwent catheter ablation for curative therapy and thereafter has not had any further episodes of tachycardia.
The ability of clozapine to induce weight gain in female rats was investigated in three studies with progressively lowered doses of clozapine. In an initial preliminary high dose study, clozapine at 6 and 12 mg/kg (i.p., b.i.d.) was found to induce weight loss. In a subsequent intermediate dose study, we obtained no evidence for clozapine-induced weight gain despite using identical procedures and doses of clozapine (1-4 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) with which we have observed olanzapine-induced weight gain, hyperphagia, enhanced adiposity and metabolic changes [Cooper G, Pickavance L, Wilding J, Halford J, Goudie A (2005). A parametric analysis of olanzapine-induced weight gain in female rats. Psychopharmacology; 181: 80-89.]. Instead, clozapine induced weight loss without alteration in food intake and muscle mass or changes in levels of glucose, insulin, leptin and prolactin. However, these intermediate doses of clozapine enhanced visceral adiposity and elevated levels of adiponectin. In a final study, low doses of clozapine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg, i.p, b.i.d.) induced weight loss. These data demonstrate that clozapine-induced weight gain can be much more difficult to observe in female rats than olanzapine-induced weight gain. Moreover, these findings contrast with clinical findings with clozapine, which induces substantial weight gain in humans. Clozapine-induced enhanced adiposity appears to be easier to observe in rats than weight gain. These findings, along with other preclinical studies, suggest that enhanced adiposity can be observed in the absence of antipsychotic-induced weight gain and hyperphagia, possibly reflecting a direct drug effect on adipocyte function independent of drug-induced hyperphagia [e.g. Minet-Ringuet J, Even P, Valet P, Carpene C, Visentin V, Prevot D, Daviaud D, Quignard-Boulange A, Tome D, de Beaurepaire R (2007). Alterations of lipid metabolism and gene expression in rat adipocytes during chronic olanzapine treatment. Molecular Psychiatry; 12: 562-571.]. These and other findings which show that the results of studies of antipsychotic treatment in animals do not always mimic clinical findings have important implications for the use of animal models of antipsychotic-induced weight gain. With regard to weight gain the results obtained appear to depend critically on the experimental procedures used and the specific drugs studied. Thus such models are not without limitations. However, they do consistently demonstrate the ability of various antipsychotics to enhance adiposity.
During the cooking of meat, mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines are formed, the most abundant of which, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4-5-b]pyridine (PhIP), induces tumors of the prostate, colon, and mammary gland in rats. Humans consuming cooked meat are exposed to PhIP on a daily basis, yet few studies have assessed the effects of PhIP at dietary relevant concentrations. In addition to its genotoxic properties, recent studies have shown that PhIP can activate estrogen receptor-mediated signaling pathways at doses that are similar to those that may be present in the body following consumption of a cooked meat meal. In the present study, we examined whether such doses of PhIP can affect estrogen receptor-independent signal transduction via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway to influence proliferation and migration in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A and the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. At doses shown to have a proliferative effect on MCF10A cells (10(-11)-10(-7) mol/L), PhIP induced a rapid, transient increase in phosphorylation of both MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 and ERKs. Inhibition of this pathway significantly reduced the PhIP-induced proliferation of MCF10A cells and the migration of PC-3 cells. The data presented here show that levels of PhIP that approximate to human dietary exposure stimulate cellular signaling pathways and result in increased growth and migration, processes linked to the promotion and progression of neoplastic disease. These findings provide strong evidence that PhIP acts as a tumor initiator and promoter and that dietary exposure to this compound could contribute to carcinogenesis in humans.
The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study conclusively demonstrated that ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and death in patients at risk for cardiovascular events but without heart failure. The Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound Changes in Patients Treated with Ramipril and Vitamin E (SECURE) substudy demonstrated that ramipril also reduced atherosclerosis. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a more important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis than previously believed, and they indicate the need for further clinical studies to define the range of benefits available from modifying the RAS. Achieving maximum benefit may require treatment with both an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker (ARB). The Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction (RESOLVD) study indicated that combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB decreased blood pressure and improved the ejection fraction more than treatment with either drug alone in patients with congestive heart failure. The Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) showed that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB reduced hospitalization for heart failure in patients with congestive heart failure by 27.5%, although no decrease in all-cause mortality was observed. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) is a large, long-term study (23,400 patients, 5.5 years). It will compare the benefits of ACE inhibitor treatment, ARB treatment, and treatment with an ACE inhibitor and ARB together, in a study population with established coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes with end-organ damage. Patients with congestive heart failure will be excluded. In a parallel study, patients unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor will be randomized to receive telmisartan or placebo (the Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-I Intolerant Patients with Cardiovascular Disease [TRANSCEND]). The primary endpoint for both trials is a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary endpoints will investigate reductions in the development of diabetes mellitus, nephropathy, dementia, and atrial fibrillation. These 2 trials are expected to provide new insights into the optimal treatment of patients at high risk of complications from atherosclerosis.
An activation of cardiac sympathetic nerves increases coronary vascular resistance distal to severe stenoses and induces ischemia of the dependent myocardium. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine and the calcium antagonist nifedipine prevent both poststenotic vasoconstriction and ischemia. To exclude the possibility that the beneficial action of nifedipine is based on unspecific coronary dilation rather than a functional antagonism against alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated poststenotic vasoconstriction we now tested coronary dilatory drugs with a different underlying mechanism. The left ventrolateral cervical cardiac sympathetic nerve was stimulated in 12 anesthetized, vagotomized dogs. A severe stenosis of left circumflex coronary artery was defined by the absence of a postocclusive reactive hyperemia. Sympathetic stimulation increased end-diastolic poststenotic resistance from 0.45 +/- 0.10 to 0.83 +/- 0.18 mmHg X min X 100 g/ml and induced a net lactate production of the poststenotic myocardium. Adenosine (50 micrograms/kg X min i.c., n = 5), dipyridamole (0.2 mg/kg i.v., n = 3) and isosorbide-dinitrate (1 mg i.c., n = 4) did not prevent the increase in resistance and the net lactate production. Thus the effectiveness to prevent alpha 2-adrenergic poststenotic coronary constriction appears to be specific for alpha 2-antagonists and calcium antagonists.
Clotrimazole (CLT) is an antifungal and antimalarial agent also effective as a Gardos channel inhibitor. In addition, CLT possesses antitumor properties. Recent data provide evidence that CLT forms a complex with heme (hemin), which produces a more potent lytic effect than heme alone. This study addressed the effect of CLT on the lysis of normal human erythrocytes induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). For the first time, it was shown that 10 microM CLT significantly enhanced the lytic effect of t-BHP on erythrocytes in both Ca(2+)-containing and Ca(2+)-free media, suggesting that the effect is not related to Gardos channels. CLT did not affect the rate of free radical generation, the kinetics of GSH degradation, methemoglobin formation and TBARS generation; therefore, we concluded that CLT does not cause additional oxidative damage to erythrocytes treated with t-BHP. It is tempted to speculate that CLT enhances t-BHP-induced changes in erythrocyte volume and lysis largely by forming a complex with hemin released during hemoglobin oxidation in erythrocytes: the CLT-hemin complex destabilizes the cell membrane more potently than hemin alone. If so, the effect of CLT on cell membrane damage during free-radical oxidation may be used to increase the efficacy of antitumor therapy.
The protective and adverse effect potentials of levetiracetam ((S)-alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidine acetamide) in rodent models of seizures and epilepsy were compared with the profile of several currently prescribed and newly developed antiepileptic drugs. Levetiracetam was devoid of anticonvulsant activity in the acute maximal electroshock seizure test and in the maximal pentylenetetrazol seizure test in mice (up to 540 mg/kg, i.p.) but exhibited potent protection against generalised epileptic seizures in electrically and pentylenetetrazol-kindled mice (ED50 values = 7 and 36 mg/kg, respectively, i.p.). This differs markedly from established and most new antiepileptic drugs which induce significant protection in both the acute seizure tests and the kindling models. Furthermore, levetiracetam was devoid of anticonvulsant activity in several maximal chemoconvulsive seizure tests although an interesting exception was the potent protection observed against secondarily generalised activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine in mice (ED50 value = 7 mg/kg, i.p.), pilocarpine and kainic acid in rats (minimum active dose = 17 and 54 mg/kg, respectively, i.p.). The protection afforded by levetiracetam on the threshold for methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM)-induced seizures persisted after chronic administration (17-170 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily/14 days) and levetiracetam did not lower the seizure threshold for the proconvulsant action of the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142). The main metabolite of levetiracetam (ucb L057; (S)-alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetic acid) was found to be inactive in sound-sensitive mice after acute administration of doses up to 548 mg/kg, i.p. Levetiracetam induced only minor behavioural alterations in both normal and amygdala-kindled rats (54-1700 mg/kg, i.p.) resulting in an unusually high safety margin between rotarod impairment and seizure suppression of 148 in corneally kindled mice and 235 in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg. In comparison, existing antiepileptic drugs have ratios between 2 and 17 in the corneally kindled mouse model. These studies reveal a unique profile of levetiracetam in rodent models. Characteristics are a general lack of anticonvulsant activity against maximal, acute seizures and selective protection with a very high safety margin in genetic and kindled animals and against chemoconvulsants producing partial epileptic seizures. This activity differs markedly from that of the established and newly introduced antiepileptic drugs and appears to derive from the parent compound since its major metabolite was inactive in all models studied. Together these results therefore suggest that levetiracetam may offer an effective, broad-spectrum treatment of epileptic seizures in patients, with a minimum of adverse effects.
To study the effects of intranigral injection of different doses of CuSO4.5H2O on dopaminergic neuron in the nigrostriatal system of rats.
Wistar rats were divided into four groups, including control group, 10 nmol, 50 nmol and 200 nmol copper injected into left substantia nigra (SN) groups. Seven days after the intranigral injection of copper, dopamine (DA) contents in the striatum (Str) were measured by high performance lipid chromotophotography (HPLC); the density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive axons in the Str was measured by TH staining method; TH and Caspase-3 mRNA expression in the SN were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We detected the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the lesioned midbrain of rats using biochemical methods.
DA and its metabolites contents had no significant difference between control group and low dose (10 nmol) copper group. But from 50 nmol copper group, DA contents in the lesioned sides were reduced with the increase in the copper doses injected, showing a significant linear correlation (F = 34.16, P < 0.01). In the 50 nmol copper group, TH positive axons in the Str decreased compared with those of the control and unlesioned sides (F = 121.9, P < 0.01). In the 50 nmol copper group, TH mRNA expression decreased (t = 3.12, P < 0.01) while Caspase-3 mRNA expression increased (t = 8.96, P < 0.01) in the SN compared with the control. SOD activity decreased in the midbrain of rats treated with 50 nmol copper compared with that of the control (t = 2.33, P < 0.01).
Copper could induce damage of dopaminergic neurons in the SN of rats through destroying antioxidant defenses and promoting apoptosis.
A case of recurrent hypercalcaemia due to chronic continuous ingestion of a calcium-containing antacid is described in whom the diagnosis was delayed because of an insufficiently detailed drug history. Specific named enquiry must be made of all the various calcium-containing drugs when seeking a history of excessive calcium intake if the diagnosis of the milk-alkali syndrome is not to be missed.
Recent trials in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes reveal important differences in the risk for major cardiovascular events when individual agents are compared. In the Fosinopril Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Trial (FACET), 380 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes were randomized to fosinopril or amlodipine and followed for up to 3.5 years to assess effects on serum lipids. Although both agents effectively controlled blood pressure, amlodipine caused a significantly greater decrease in systolic pressure. At the end of the trial, serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, serum glucose, plasma insulin, serum creatinine, and microalbuminuria were similar in both groups. The patients randomized to fosinopril were significantly less likely to experience the prospectively defined combined outcome of acute myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalized angina, or stroke compared to those randomized to amlodipine (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.26-0.95). In the Appropriate Blood pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial, 470 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes who were randomized to long-acting nisoldipine had an adjusted sevenfold increased risk for acute MI compared to those randomized to enalapril (RR 7.0; 95% CI 2.3-21.4). In the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS) trial, the patients with hypertension and above the median of HbA1c (> or =6.7%) randomized to isradipine had a threefold increased risk for major cardiovascular events compared to those randomized to hydrochlorothiazide (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.09-7.26). These findings are supported by several observational studies. Therefore, evidence is emerging that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and low-dose diuretics may be more effective than calcium antagonists for prevention of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with diabetes or impaired glucose control.
