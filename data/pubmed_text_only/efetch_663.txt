Overexpression of ERBB2 and its neighboring genes on chromosome 17 occurs in approximately 25% of breast tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. While amplification of the 17q12-21 chromosomal region often correlates with an increase in the transcriptional rates of the locus, the molecular mechanisms and the factors involved in the coordinated expression of genes residing within the ERBB2 amplicon remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα, NR3B1) and its coregulator PGC-1β are key effectors in this process. Using a mouse model of ERBB2-initiated mammary tumorigenesis, we first show that ablation of ERRα significantly delays ERBB2-induced tumor development and lowers the levels of amplicon transcripts. Chromosome 17q-wide binding site location analyses in human breast cancer cells show preferential recruitment of ERRα to DNA segments associated with the ERBB2 amplicon. Furthermore, ERRα directs the co-recruitment of the coactivator PGC-1β to segments in the 17q12 region and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoters of the ERBB2 and coamplified genes. ERRα and PGC-1β also participate in the de-repression of ERBB2 expression through competitive genomic cross-talk with estrogen receptor α (ERα) and, as a consequence, influence tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ERRα and PGC-1β are key players in the etiology of malignant breast cancer by coordinating the transcriptional regulation of genes located in the 17q12 region, a process that also involves interference with the repressive function of ERα on ERBB2 expression.
The effect of ICRF 159 on adriamycin (ADR) cardiotoxicity and on total myocardial calcium content was examined in rats. ICRF 159 did not increase the survival time of ADR-treated animals; however the histological findings showed a significant prevention of ADR-induced cardiomyopathy (CMP) by ICRF. The total myocardial calcium content of animals treated with ADR was significantly higher, while no significant difference was seen in animals pretreated with ICRF 159 as compared with controls. As these findings suggested a role of calcium in ADR CMP and in the pharmacological action of ICRF in this disease, we also tested a closely related chelating agent, EDTA. This molecule decreased myocardial calcium levels in ADR-treated animals almost to normal values; however the histological cardiac alterations were not prevented.
Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is involved in neural development and is the target for neurodegeneration induced by selected organophosphorus pesticides and chemical warfare agents. We generated mice with disruptions in Nte, the gene encoding NTE. Nte(-/-) mice die after embryonic day 8, and Nte(+/-) mice have lower activity of Nte in the brain and higher mortality when exposed to the Nte-inhibiting compound ethyl octylphosphonofluoridate (EOPF) than do wild-type mice. Nte(+/-) and wild-type mice treated with 1 mg per kg of body weight of EOPF have elevated motor activity, showing that even minor reduction of Nte activity leads to hyperactivity. These studies show that genetic or chemical reduction of Nte activity results in a neurological phenotype of hyperactivity in mammals and indicate that EOPF toxicity occurs directly through inhibition of Nte without the requirement for Nte gain of function or aging.
The antinociceptive profile of St. John's Wort (SJW) was investigated in mice in a condition of acute thermal and chemical pain, together with the mechanism that might underlie this effect. A dried extract of SJW induced a prolonged antinociception that persisted for 120 minutes after administration. The thermal antinociception was prevented by naloxone and by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator PMA, whereas the chemical antinociception was prevented by PMA, remaining naloxone insensitive. A chloroform (CHL) and a methanol (MET) fraction, obtained to investigate the involvement of the SJW main components, hyperforin and hypericin/flavonoid, respectively, increased pain threshold with a time course comparable to the dried extract. The CHL antinociception was prevented by naloxone, whereas the MET antinociception was antagonized by PMA. Purified hyperforin and hypericin showed an antinociceptive efficacy comparable to CHL and MET, respectively. Conversely, flavonoids were devoid of any effect. The administration of yohimbine and atropine did not modify SJW, CHL and MET antinociception. These results indicate that both CHL and MET fractions mediate the SJW-induced antinociception. In particular, the presence of hypericin was fundamental to induce both thermal and chemical antinociception through the inhibition of the PKC activity, whereas hyperforin selectively produced a thermal opioid antinociception.
This article presents evidence of a persistent thermal and chemical antinociception of SJW that is mainly mediated by PKC-inhibiting mechanisms. These findings identify important targets for a longer-acting activation of endogenous pain systems and should potentially help clinicians who seek safe, tolerable, and prolonged treatments for pain relief.
Podocyte loss contributes to the development of glomerulosclerosis. Although podocyte detachment has been recognized as a new mechanism of podocyte loss in glomerular diseases, its time course and relationship to disease activity are not known. Urinary excretion of viable podocytes was quantified in two models of transient glomerular injury, i.e., rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis (PAN) and mesangioproliferative nephropathy (anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis model), as well as in a model of continuous glomerular injury, i.e., hypertensive nephropathy (5/6-nephrectomy model), and in aging rats. The number of glomerular Wilm's tumor (WT)-1-positive podocytes and the glomerular expression of cell-cycle proteins in vivo were assessed. Urinary podocyte loss occurred in both primary (PAN) and secondary (anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis) in parallel to the onset of proteinuria. However, subsequently proteinuria persisted despite remission of podocyturia. In continuous glomerular injury, i.e., after 5/6-nephrectomy, podocyturia paralleled the course of proteinuria and of systemic hypertension, whereas no podocyturia became detectable during normal aging (up to 12 mo). Despite podocyte detachment of varying degrees, no decrease in glomerular podocyte counts (i.e., WT-1 positive nuclei) was noted in either disease model. Podocyturia in the PAN and anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis model was preceded by entry of glomerular podocytes into the cell cycle, i.e., cyclin D1, cdc2, and/or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. Podocyturia is a widespread phenomenon in glomerular disease and not simply a reflection of proteinuria because it is limited to phases of ongoing glomerular injury. The data suggest that podocyturia may become a more sensitive means to assess the activity of glomerular damage than proteinuria.
Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS or Ondine's curse; OMIM 209880) is a life-threatening disorder involving an impaired ventilatory response to hypercarbia and hypoxemia. This core phenotype is associated with lower-penetrance anomalies of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) including Hirschsprung disease and tumors of neural-crest derivatives such as ganglioneuromas and neuroblastomas. In mice, the development of ANS reflex circuits is dependent on the paired-like homeobox gene Phox2b. Thus, we regarded its human ortholog, PHOX2B, as a candidate gene in CCHS. We found heterozygous de novo mutations in PHOX2B in 18 of 29 individuals with CCHS. Most mutations consisted of 5-9 alanine expansions within a 20-residue polyalanine tract probably resulting from non-homologous recombination. We show that PHOX2B is expressed in both the central and the peripheral ANS during human embryonic development. Our data support an essential role of PHOX2B in the normal patterning of the autonomous ventilation system and, more generally, of the ANS in humans.
We report a case of tongue cancer presenting with SSD type brain embolism induced by chemotherapy with CBDCA and 5-FU (CF Therapy) A 35-year-old woman underwent CF therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Immediately after CF therapy, aphasia and serious exercise paralysis appeared. However, symptoms disappeared 2 days later and no abnormality was found by brain CT. We report that SSD type brain embolism is one of the noteworthy side effects of CF therapy.
Prolidase (peptidase D) catalyzes hydrolysis of the di- and tripeptide with carboxyl-terminal proline and plays an important role in recycling proline in various cells and tissues. By using human prolidase cDNA as a probe, a chromosomal gene related to prolidase was isolated from human gene libraries. The human prolidase gene is over 130 kilobases long and is split into 15 exons. All of the splice donor and acceptor sites conform to the GT/AG rule. The transcription initiation site was determined by nuclease S1 mapping and primer extension and was located 131 bases upstream from the initiation codon. A "CAAT" box-like sequence was present 67 bases upstream from the cap site, but there was no "TATA" box-like sequence. There were seven sets of sequences resembling the transcription factor Sp1 binding sites. Four were upstream from the cap site, and three were downstream. We also analyzed findings in patients with prolidase deficiency with respect to major gene re-arrangement. Several hundred base deletions, including the 14th exon, were identified. Knowledge of the gene structure of human prolidase will facilitate further studies on the expression and regulation of this gene and provide necessary information for analyses of mutations in patients with this deficiency.
To investigate the mechanism of relief of angina pectoris by diltiazem administration, 14 patients with effort angina were studied using a protocol to control heart rate. Coronary, systemic and left ventricular (LV) hemodynamic function was assessed at rest and during tachycardia stress (atrial pacing)-induced angina before and during diltiazem infusion. Angina occurred in all patients during tachycardia stress before diltiazem administration. During tachycardia stress at the heart rate that produced angina after diltiazem infusion, pressure-rate product, coronary sinus flow and resistance and ST-segment depression were all similar to findings before diltiazem. Although at the onset of angina, systolic pressure was usually slightly lower after diltiazem infusion (138 +/- 11 vs 128 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), the pacing rate at onset of angina was higher in only 3 patients and the pressure-rate product was higher in only 1 patient. After diltiazem, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased less frequently after interruption of pacing. The results suggest that diltiazem favorably alters the relation between myocardial oxygen demand and supply at rest, but during tachycardia, anginal threshold and coronary reserve do not change. Diltiazem's potent antianginal action, shown in previous investigations using exercise-induced angina, is not prominent when heart rate is controlled. The major benefit of diltiazem in patients with stress-induced angina is related to reduction of myocardial oxygen demand rather than improved myocardial oxygen delivery.
We describe longitudinal diffusion-weighted MRI findings of sub-acute leukoencephalopathy following methotrexate therapy in a 24-year-old man diagnosed with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), presenting with right-sided paralysis and aphasia after second consolidation with intrathecal triple-drug therapy given intrathecally. This case demonstrates the value of DWI in evaluation and diagnosis of sub-acute toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients being treated with methotrexate. The longitudinal follow up DWI findings suggest reversible metabolic derangement rather than ischemia as the cause of these findings.
Many laboratory-based studies indicate that benzodiazepines impair explicit memory performance, increase sedation, and impair attention.
The present study was designed to extend prior lab-based findings to an applied setting in which the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines may be beneficial for users. In addition, the study extended the previous adult-focused research by examining the cognitive effects of benzodiazepines in children.
The present study examined the use of a specific benzodiazepine (midazolam) as a premedicant among 40 children aged 4-6 years old having ear tube (myringotomy) surgery, who were randomly assigned to receive midazolam or placebo.
Consistent with previous studies, the results indicated that midazolam causes significant amnesia on a cued recall task. In addition, free recall for post-drug events were also impaired by midazolam relative to placebo, indicating that benzodiazepine-induced amnesia occurs even for highly salient information.
Overall, it appears that benzodiazepines do impair memory in a pediatric population. This amnesia was not secondary to the inattention and sedation also caused by midazolam administration. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed, as are potential future studies.
The authors report two cases of benign intracranial hypertension associated to Aspirin therapy promptly regressed after withdrawal of the drug. This side effect did never described and its pathogenetic mechanism is unknown.
Adhesion molecules have been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, which is highly prevalent in people with diabetes. Adhesion molecules can mediate adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. Furthermore, P-selectin expressed on platelets is able to mediate the adhesion of leukocytes to platelets. In this study, we examine the in-vivo and in-vitro effects of rosiglitazone with particular emphasis on three important adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and P-selectin). In the aorta of STZ-diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE KO) mice, rosiglitazone significantly reduced both total and arch plaque area. The mechanism for this appeared to be reduced macrophage infiltration into the atherosclerotic plaque which was also associated with reduced mRNA levels for VCAM-1, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and P-selectin in the aorta. In-vitro studies revealed reduced cell adhesion of monocytic cells (THP-1) to fibrinogen and endothelial cells (HUVEC) after incubation with rosiglitazone. Furthermore, the reduction in leukocyte adhesion also correlated with significant reductions in mRNA levels for VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and P-selectin indicating that reduced macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques may occur as a result of a direct effect of rosiglitazone on adhesion molecules in both monocytes and endothelial cells. Thus, we have shown that rosiglitazone appears to have direct anti-atherosclerotic effects in an animal model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis which are at least partly due to effects on VCAM-1, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and P-selectin expression which leads to decreased leukocyte adhesion and macrophage infiltration.
Cholinergic receptor blockade produces memory deficits in animal models. These deficits can be prevented by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, which increases acetylcholine release. We investigated the effects on cognitive performance of combined treatments of ondansetron with either flumazenil, a GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site antagonist, or tacrine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, which are also able to prevent scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment.
Spatial learning and memory was assessed by studying the effects of single and combined treatments on acquisition and retention of the Morris water maze task in rats.
Scopolamine (0.6 mg/kg) induced significant learning and retention deficits. Both ondansetron (0.1 microg/kg) and tacrine (3 mg/kg) partially prevented the scopolamine-induced learning deficit. A full reversal was only found after the combined treatment of ondansetron with flumazenil (10 mg/kg) and also after tacrine in combination with ondansetron. Likewise, scopolamine-induced retention deficit was fully counteracted by the combined treatment of ondansetron with either flumazenil or tacrine, and only partially by any of the single treatments tested.
The scopolamine-induced impairment of learning and retention in the water maze is fully prevented by ondansetron when given in combination with either flumazenil or tacrine, suggesting that both combined treatments result in a potentiated cholinergic function and may constitute the basis of a new therapy for cognitive disorders.
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) are compounds used as additive flame retardants in plastics, electronic equipment, and textiles. The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro effects of the pentabrominated diphenyl ether mixture, DE-71, and HBCD on cerebellar granule cells (CGC). Both DE-71 and HBCD induced death of CGC in low micromolar concentrations. The NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (3 microM), and the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol (50 microM) significantly reduced the cell death. Incubation of the compounds together with the rat liver post-mitochondrial (S9) fraction reduced cell death by 58 and 64% for DE-71 and HBCD, respectively. No ROS formation and no elevation in intracellular calcium were observed. We further demonstrated apoptotic morphology (Hoechst straining) after exposure to low levels of the two brominated flame retardants and signs of DNA laddering were found after DE-71 exposure. However, other hallmarks of apoptosis, like caspase activity, were absent indicating an atypical form of apoptosis induced by DE-71. After intraperitoneal injection of the two compounds both DE-71 and HBCD were found in significant amounts in brain (559 +/- 194 and 49 +/- 13 microg/kg, respectively) and liver (4,010 +/- 2,437 and 1,248 +/- 505 microg/kg, respectively) 72 h after injection. Our results indicate that the lower brominated PBDEs have a higher potency of bioaccumulation than HBCD, and that both compounds have a neurotoxic potential in vitro.
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, side effects and continuation rates of the implant system in Thai women. A five-year clinical study of 308 women receiving Norplant-6 implants in Bangkok was conducted. Acceptors' mean age was 29 years, and mean number of children was about two. More than half of the users (63%) finished primary school. The cumulative continuation rates for Norplant implants at first, second, third, fourth and fifth years were, respectively, 98%, 91%, 83%, 78% and 71%. Eight out of a total of eleven pregnancies occurred in the fourth and fifth year of use. The cumulative pregnancy rate was 1.1% for the third year, 2.0% for the fourth year and 4.2% for the fifth year. Desire for future pregnancy was the leading cause for termination of Norplant implants use. The five-year cumulative termination rate for planned pregnancy was 9.2%. Disruption of menstrual rhythm, particularly increased bleeding, was the other main reason for termination; however, the prevalence of menstrual irregularities appeared to diminish with time. The cumulative termination rate for menstrual irregularities in the fifth year of the study was 4.4%. The complaints of "other medical reasons" for removal of Norplant implants were acne, severe headache, and chloasma. The five-year cumulative termination rate for other personal reasons was 7.9%. These personal reasons were husband having vasectomy, husband objection and divorce. It can be seen from this five-year study that Norplant implants are well accepted by Thai women. However, the efficacy in preventing pregnancy was not acceptable during the fourth and fifth year of use in this study, which was different from results of other international studies.
Between June 1986 and December 1988, staff at a family planning clinic in greater Bangkok, Thailand, recruited 308 healthy women aged 18-45 for a clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, side effects, and continuation rates of the contraceptive implant system Norplant. Their average parity was 1.9 live births. The cumulative first-, second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-year continuation rates stood at 97.6%, 90.7%, 82.9%, 77.9%, and 71%, respectively. During the first two years, no Norplant acceptor became pregnant. In the third year, however, the cumulative accidental pregnancy rate was 1.1% and increased to 2% in the fourth year and 4.2% in the fifth year. All accidental pregnancies were intrauterine. The major reason for Norplant removal was desire for pregnancy (5-year cumulative termination rate = 9.2%) followed by changes in menstruation patterns, particularly increased menstrual bleeding (4.4%). The prevalence of menstruation disorders decreased with time, however. For example, 64.8% of all users experienced an irregular menstrual cycle during the first 1-3 months of Norplant use. By 22-24 months of use, it had fallen to 54.9%, and to 39.5% by 58-60 months of use. The five-year cumulative termination rate for other personal reasons was 7.9%. These reasons included husband undergoing vasectomy, husband's objection to Norplant, and divorce. The relatively high continuation rates at the first and fifth year of use suggest that Thai women accepted Norplant well. The higher accidental pregnancy rates at four and five years of use than those of other international studies are troublesome, however.
Hypertension and osteoporosis are two major age-related disorders; however, the underlying molecular mechanism for this comorbidity is not known. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the control of blood pressure and has been an important target of antihypertensive drugs. Using a chimeric RAS model of transgenic THM (Tsukuba hypertensive mouse) expressing both the human renin and human angiotensinogen genes, we showed in this study that activation of RAS induces high turnover osteoporosis with accelerated bone resorption. Transgenic mice that express only the human renin gene were normotensive and yet exhibited a low bone mass, suggesting that osteoporosis occurs independently of the development of hypertension per se. Ex vivo cultures showed that angiotensin II (AngII) acted on osteoblasts and not directly on osteoclast precursor cells and increased osteoclastogenesis-supporting cytokines, RANKL and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby stimulating the formation of osteoclasts. Knockdown of AT2 receptor inhibited the AngII activity, whereas silencing of the AT1 receptor paradoxically enhanced it, suggesting a functional interaction between the two AngII receptors on the osteoblastic cell surface. Finally, treatment of THM mice with an ACE inhibitor, enalapril, improved osteoporosis and hypertension, whereas treatment with losartan, an angiotensin receptor blockers specific for AT1, resulted in exacerbation of the low bone mass phenotype. Thus, blocking the synthesis of AngII may be an effective treatment of osteoporosis and hypertension, especially for those afflicted with both conditions.
The presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) increases the risk for thromboembolic events in ventricular assist device (VAD) patients undergoing transplantation. However, cardiopulmonary bypass with alternative anticoagulants is often complicated by bleeding. Owing to this concern, we compared outcomes of HIT-positive versus control bridge-to-transplantation VAD patients; both groups were reexposed to heparin for cardiopulmonary bypass during transplant.
From February 2000 to January 2006, data were reviewed on 92 consecutive adult patients who underwent VAD placement as a bridge to transplantation. Patients in whom thrombocytopenia developed after heparin exposure were tested for HIT with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antiheparin/platelet factor-4 (HPF4) antibody (GTI Diagnostics, Waukesha, Wisconsin). During VAD support, heparin was avoided in HIT-positive patients, but all patients were reexposed to heparin during transplantation. Comparisons between HIT-positive and control patients for survival and freedom from thromboembolic events were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Student t test.
Twenty-four of the 92 patients (26.1%) were determined to be HIT positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Survival to transplant was not different between the two groups. When compared with control patients, HIT-positive patients who were reexposed to heparin had a greater decrease in platelet counts immediately after transplant (postoperative days 1 to 4, p < 0.05). Despite this transient thrombocytopenia, there was no difference in posttransplant mortality or thromboembolism.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-positive VAD patients did not experience increased thromboembolism or mortality after heparin reexposure. In light of the risks of using heparin alternatives, heparin reexposure is a safe management strategy for HIT-positive VAD patients.
Little is known about the role that Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, plays in solid tumor biology and susceptibility to anticancer therapy. We observed that the Mcl-1 protein is widely expressed in human sarcoma cell lines of different histological origin (n = 7). Because the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins can significantly contribute to the chemoresistance of human malignancies, we used an antisense strategy to address this issue in sarcoma.
SCID mice (n = 6/group) received s.c. injections of SW872 liposarcoma cells. After development of palpable tumors, mice were treated by s.c.-implanted miniosmotic pumps prefilled with saline or antisense or universal control oligonucleotides (20 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks). On days 2, 6, and 10, mice were treated with low-dose cyclophosphamide (35 mg/kg i.p) or saline control. During the experiments, tumor weight was assessed twice weekly by caliper measurements. On day 14, animals were sacrificed. Tumors were weighed and fixed in formalin for immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling analysis.
Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides specifically reduced Mcl-1 protein expression but produced no reduction in tumor weight compared with saline-treated control animals. Cyclophosphamide monotreatment caused only modest tumor weight reduction compared with saline control. However, use of Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides combined with cyclophosphamide clearly enhanced tumor cell apoptosis and significantly reduced tumor weight by more than two-thirds compared with respective control treatments.
A combination of Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides with low-dose cyclophosphamide provides a synergistic antitumor effect and might qualify as a promising strategy to overcome chemoresistance in human sarcoma.
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by distressing sensations deep inside the limbs, typically occurring at bedtime or rest. These paresthesias involve an irresistible urge to move the limb, which provides temporary relief but at the expense of sleep and quality of life. The pathophysiology of RLS has been related to dopaminergic pathway dysfunction, thereby aligning it closely with depression from both pathophysiologic and treatment perspectives. Certain antidepressant drugs, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), may induce or exacerbate RLS. We describe the case of a 34-year-old woman with no history of RLS who came to the emergency department with acute decompensated heart failure. After 7 days of hospitalization, she was waitlisted to receive a heart transplant. Her mood became depressed, and she requested a psychiatric consultation; escitalopram 10 mg at bedtime was started. Within 2 days of starting therapy, she developed very severe (determined by a score based on an RLS symptom rating scale) RLS symptoms, warranting the discontinuation of escitalopram. Within 2 days of stopping therapy, her RLS symptoms improved considerably (rated as mild). One week later, the patient was rechallenged with a lower dose of escitalopram, and her very severe RLS symptoms reappeared. Within 2 days of stopping escitalopram, her RLS symptoms again improved, with complete resolution 1 week later. Using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, which assesses the probability of a drug causing an adverse event, the patient's score was 9, indicating a definite adverse drug reaction. Although published case reports have linked fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine, and mirtazapine to RLS, this is the first report, to our knowledge, of escitalopram as a cause of RLS. Based on this case and additional data published with other SSRIs and SNRIs, we believe that escitalopram should be added to the list of agents that can induce RLS.
A case history of a patient who developed severe anxiety and agitation on two occasions after discontinuation of a midazolam infusion is presented. The withdrawal symptoms interfered with effective mechanical ventilation and the patient required the reintroduction of a long-acting benzodiazepine to treat the withdrawal state and to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation.
Clinical reports have suggested that antidepressant medication may contribute to the sexual dysfunction experienced by some depressed patients. A double-blind trial in a non-psychiatric male population compared amitriptyline (tricyclic), mianserin (tetracyclic) and placebo for their effects on nocturnal sexual arousal. In a three-way crossover design active drug or placebo were taken for two weeks preceding measurement of the frequency, amplitude and duration of nocturnal penile tumescence and synchronous sleep indices. Both active compounds significantly decreased the amplitude and the total duration of nocturnal erections. The effects on sleep indices were as previously reported. Few differences were found between the tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs. Some implications of these findings are considered.
Determine the frequency and nature of interruptions in HIV-1 protease inhibitor treatment in HIV-infected patients.
A longitudinal study included patients treated with antiretroviral protocols including at least one antiprotease and followed from 1 March 1996 through 1 March 1998.
Among the 309 patients followed for the duration of the study, 137 (44.3%) interrupted their antiprotease treatment at least once. Withdrawal was warranted by therapeutic failure in 49.6% of the cases and by drug intolerance in 45.4%. Drug intolerance concerned 37%, 36.7%, 5.7% and 2.9% of the patients taking ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir respectively (p < 106). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that saquinavir was significantly associated with better tolerance and with efficacy at least as good as ritonavir or indinavir. The most frequent cause for interrupting treatment were digestive disorders for ritonavir (20% of the treated patients) and lithiasic manifestations for indinavir (9.4%). The ritonavir-hepatitis C association appeared to predispose to drug-induced perturbed liver tests.
Drug intolerance is a frequent cause of treatment interruption. Therapeutic success in HIV infection requires improved efficacy but also better tolerated antiretorviral drugs, particularly antiretroviral drugs.
O(2)-vinyl 1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (V-PYRRO/NO) is a liver-selective nitric oxide donor that has been shown to protect against hepatotoxic effects of endotoxin, acetaminophen and cadmium. This study examined the effects of V-PYRRO/NO on alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Mice were given V-PYRRO/NO via osmotic pumps (5.4mg/ml; 0.5 microl/h) starting 24h before receiving a hepatotoxic dose of ANIT (150mg/kg in olive oil, i.g.), and continuing for additional 48h (3-day pumps). V-PYRRO/NO administration partially ameliorated ANIT-induced hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by reduced serum alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, markers of liver cell death, and by improved liver pathology. However, V-PYRRO/NO had no effect on ANIT-induced cholestasis, as ANIT-increased serum bilirubin levels and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity were not ameliorated. Microarray and real time RT-PCR analysis revealed that ANIT intoxication altered expression of various genes, including genes encoding metabolic enzymes, transporter proteins, acute phase proteins, inflammation- and, apoptosis-related genes, as well as other genes related to liver injury. V-PYRRO/NO treatment attenuated ANIT-induced elevations in certain inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes, but had no effect on ANIT-induced disturbance on the expression of genes related to metabolism, transport, and acute phase proteins. Thus, the liver-selective NO donor, V-PYRRO/NO, was partially protective against ANIT-induced liver injury, without affecting ANIT-induced cholestasis and cholestasis-related gene expression.
