We report results of a nonsynonymous SNP scan for ulcerative colitis and identify a previously unknown susceptibility locus at ECM1. We also show that several risk loci are common to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (IL23R, IL12B, HLA, NKX2-3 and MST1), whereas autophagy genes ATG16L1 and IRGM, along with NOD2 (also known as CARD15), are specific for Crohn's disease. These data provide the first detailed illustration of the genetic relationship between these common inflammatory bowel diseases.
A 57-year-old man with mild neuropathy who was positive for hepatitis B and C viruses was treated with lamivudine 300 mg.day(-1). After 3 months he presented with dysphonia and progressive muscle weakness. Subsequently, he developed tetraparesis followed by acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, which was complicated by sudden cardiac arrest. After lamivudine was stopped, the neuropathy improved and respiratory capacity improved. Unfortunately, the patient died suddenly in spite of haemodynamic, ventilatory and metabolic support. Electrophysiological studies showed evidence of a sensory-motor axonal neuropathy. Nerve biopsy, muscle biopsy, biochemistry and mitochondrial DNA molecular genetics suggested possible widespread iatrogenic mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial DNA dysfunction could be a potential cause of the sudden cardiac arrest. Stopping lamivudine treatment sooner after the onset of peripheral neuropathy or its exacerbation is important as continued therapy could lead to acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission.
To study the cardiac toxicity of arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)).
To investigate and analyze the probable mechanisms of cardiac toxicity of As(2)O(3) by dynamic monitoring of clinical manifestations, basal cardiac rate and electrocardiographic data of acute promyelocyte leukemia (APL) patients during As(2)O(3) therapy. The instant change of the action potential, the I(Ca-L) and I(k) of single cardiac myocyte of guinea pig was also observed with patch clamp dynamically.
Approximately 71.4% of the 28 cases of APL showed cardiac toxic reaction in different degree in the first week after As(2)O(3) intravenous infusion in general dose, mainly expressing rapid heart rate or prolonged QT interval. As(2)O(3) could prolong the action potential duration from (563.0 +/- 55.8) ms to (737.7 +/- 131.7) ms (P < 0.05) and increased the I(Ca-L) and I(k) of single cardiac myocyte of guinea pig in vitro.
As(2)O(3) intravenous infusion in general therapeutic dose can cause tachycardia and prolong QT interval in some of the APL patients. The probable mechanism of these side-effects may be due to instant involvement of ionic channel of cardiac myocyte.
To reevaluate the risk associated with in utero exposure to lithium.
Data were obtained from all published studies, in multiple languages, referenced in MEDLINE, Toxline, and the Lithium Information Center databases. Unpublished studies were not included. The search terms were lithium, pregnancy, teratogen, abnormalities (drug induced), Ebstein's anomaly, and adverse effects.
In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring. The relative risk for Ebstein's anomaly among such children was estimated to be 400 on the basis of data collected from a registry of voluntarily submitted cases. More recent controlled epidemiologic studies have consistently shown a lower risk. No women who took lithium during pregnancy were found among four case-control studies of Ebstein's anomaly involving 25, 34, 59, and 89 affected children, respectively. In two cohort studies, risk ratios of 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 7.7) and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.4 to 6.8) for all congenital anomalies have been observed. The risk ratios for cardiac malformations in these studies were 7.7 (95% CI, 1.5 to 41.2) and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.1 to 18.3), respectively.
While initial information regarding the teratogenic risk of lithium treatment was derived from biased retrospective reports, more recent epidemiologic data indicate that the teratogenic risk of first-trimester lithium exposure is lower than previously suggested. The clinical management of women with bipolar disorder who have childbearing potential should be modified with this revised risk estimate.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role for a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design was employed. Half log incremental doses of intravenous methoxamine or placebo (saline) were administered to a group of women with genuine stress incontinence while measuring maximum urethral pressure (MUP), blood pressure, heart rate, and symptomatic side effects. Methoxamine evoked non-significant increases in MUP and diastolic blood pressure but caused a significant rise in systolic blood pressure and significant fall in heart rate at maximum dosage. Systemic side effects including piloerection, headache, and cold extremities were experienced in all subjects. The results indicate that the clinical usefulness of direct, peripherally acting sub-type-selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists in the medical treatment of stress incontinence may be limited by associated piloerection and cardiovascular side effects.
We report an autopsy case of methamphetamine-related intracranial hemorrhage and vasculitis. The possible relationship between drug usage and the occurrence of intracranial bleeding and cerebral vasculitis in such patients is discussed. A 22-year-old woman died after an intravenous injection of unknown dose of methamphetamine. A computed tomography head scan demonstrated massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hematoma in corpus callosum. Cerebral angiography revealed nonfilling of bilateral intracranial carotid arteries and extravasation of contrast medium from right pericallosal artery which was visualized retrogradely via vertebral artery. Postmortem studies showed cerebral edema, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracranial vasculitis in the absence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation or chronic hypertension. Histological findings of necrosis of blood vessel walls with destruction of the elastica and smooth muscle layer, and without leukocytotic infiltration of the blood vessel walls were observed in order of anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, vertebral, posterior cerebral and basilar arteries. These angiographic and histological evidence suggests that such hemorrhage results from the development of fibrinonecrosis in the large intracerebral vessels, in addition to a sudden rise in blood pressure.
The possible interference of tamoxifen with anti-tumor vaccines was studied in a translational view of combined preventive approaches. Tamoxifen treatment of HER-2/neu transgenic mice combined to anti-HER-2/neu cell vaccine did not hamper the efficacy of cancer immunoprevention, and caused a significantly increased production of interferon-gamma. These data suggest that tamoxifen could even have a positive impact on the efficacy of cancer immunoprevention.
Enone prodrugs of dopaminergic catecholamines represent a new type of prodrug in the research area of dopamine agonists. Here, we demonstrate the first benzo[g]quinoline-derived enone that induces potent dopamine agonist effects similar to aminotetralin-derived enones. Significant effects of (-)-4 were observed in microdialysis studies after administration of 1 nmol kg(-1) sc and 3 nmol kg(-1) po. With a potency comparable to that of the most potent apomorphines, (-)-4 could potentially compete with L-DOPA and apomorphine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway is frequently disrupted in cancer and implicated in multiple aspects of tumor growth and survival. In addition, increased activity of this pathway in cancer is associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that PI3K inhibitors could help to overcome resistance to chemotherapies. We used preclinical cancer models to determine the effects of combining the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin with GDC-0941, a class I PI3K inhibitor that is currently being tested in early-stage clinical trials. We found that PI3K inhibition significantly increased apoptosis and enhanced the antitumor effects of doxorubicin in a defined set of breast and ovarian cancer models. Doxorubicin treatment caused an increase in the amount of nuclear phospho-Akt(Ser473) in cancer cells that rely on the PI3K pathway for survival. This increased phospho-Akt(Ser473) response to doxorubicin correlates with the strength of GDC-0941's effect to augment doxorubicin action. These studies predict that clinical use of combination therapies with GDC-0941 in addition to DNA-damaging agents will be effective in tumors that rely on the PI3K pathway for survival.
The SCNNIA gene, which is located on human chromosome 12p13.3, encodes the alpha subunit of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel, and mutations in SCNNIA can result in pseudohypoaldosteronism type I. It was postulated that genetic variations in SCNN1A could lead to an increased risk of hypertension. Sequence variations in SCNN1A were identified, and the association between these polymorphisms and BP was examined in a large cohort (n = 3898) representing the general population in Japan. Four polymorphisms in the promoter region, three polymorphisms in the exonic region, and one polymorphism in the first intron were identified. Because association studies with one-half of the study population indicated that the A(2139)G polymorphism, among others, significantly affected BP, this polymorphism was studied in the entire study population. Multiple logistic analyses indicated that the odds ratio for hypertension with the GA+GG genotype was 1.31 (P = 0.0154) in the total population and 1.77 (P = 0.0035) among subjects <60 yr of age. A significantly higher frequency of proteinuria was also observed among subjects with the GA+GG genotype. A transient transfection assay using MDCK cells indicated that the promoter activity of the G(2139) allele was higher than that of the A(2139) allele. Therefore, possession of the SCNN1A G(2139) allele significantly increased the risk of hypertension. A lower level of SCNN1A subunit expression among subjects with the AA genotype might lead to lower levels of sodium reabsorption in the kidney and might provide protection against the development of hypertension.
The effect of naloxone on the hypotensive and bradycardiac action of clonidine was studied in 27 hospitalized patients with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. In a double-blind, crossover study, clonidine, 0.3 mg/day orally for 3 days, significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, whereas placebo was ineffective. Naloxone, 0.4 mg given intravenously on the third day of clonidine treatment, caused a rapid increase in blood pressure and heart rate in 14 patients (reacting group), but was ineffective in the remaining 13 patients (nonreacting group). Naloxone given during the placebo period was ineffective in all patients. Both the clonidine-induced hypotension and the rebound increase in blood pressure after cessation of clonidine were significantly greater in the reacting than in the nonreacting group. These observations suggest that release of an endogenous opioid contributes to the antihypertensive action of clonidine; this mechanism may be also involved in the discontinuation syndrome after cessation of clonidine.
Following up on recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Crohn's disease, we investigated 50 previously reported susceptibility loci in a German sample of individuals with Crohn's disease (n = 1,850) or ulcerative colitis (n = 1,103) and healthy controls (n = 1,817). Among these loci, we identified variants in 3p21.31, NKX2-3 and CCNY as susceptibility factors for both diseases, whereas variants in PTPN2, HERC2 and STAT3 were associated only with ulcerative colitis in our sample collection.
A case of tocainide-induced nodal bradycardia in standard recommended dose is reported. There was no recurrence when the drug was subsequently reintroduced in a reduced dosage. It is suggested that in the elderly, tocainide should be used in a lower dosage than normally recommended.
We report a new case of chronic interstitial nephritis in a patient with ulcerative colitis diagnosed in 2002 who was originally treated with 5-ASA. Three years later deterioration of renal function was apparent with an increase in serum creatinine, which was normal before treatment. Withdrawal of 5-ASA led to partial improvement of renal function. In patients with a delayed diagnosis of kidney damage, recovery of renal function is incomplete and, in some cases, the patient even requires some form of renal replacement therapy. We stress the importance of monitoring renal function in patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease treated with this drug.
We report an 84-year-old woman who suffered from acute fentanyl intoxication followed by delayed encephalopathy. She used fentanyl patch at her ached knee joint and stayed in the covered table with a heat source underneath. Serum concentration of fentanyl suddenly elevated and she developed coma due to acute fentanyl intoxication. She gradually recovered, however, she showed consciousness disturbance again at 15th day and developed neurological symptoms including mutism, pyramidal tract signs, frontal lobe signs and parkinsonism. These symptoms also steadily improved without specific treatment, and became able to talk with colleagues and walk with assistance at 90th day. We considered that delayed encephalopathy due to periodic anoxia caused by fentanyl intoxication occurred in the present patient; however, the neurological sequelae were relatively mild as compared with reported cases of carbon monoxide intoxication. Neuroprotective effect of fentanyl may have contributed to the better prognosis in the present patient.
The AP-1 transcription factor plays a major role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and developmental processes. AP-1 proteins are primarily considered to be oncogenic. Gene disruption studies placed c-Jun as an oncogene at the early stage of a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Mice lacking c-Jun display reduced number and size of hepatic tumors attributed to elevated p53 expression and increased apoptosis. This suggests that c-Jun inhibition may serve as a therapeutic target for liver cancer. The c-Jun dimerization protein 2, JDP2 is an AP-1 repressor protein that potently inhibits AP-1 transcription. On the other hand, the JDP2 locus was found at a recurring viral integration site in T-cell lymphoma. We sought to examine the potential of JDP2 to inhibit c-Jun/AP-1 oncogenic activity in mice. Towards this end, we generated a tetracycline inducible transgenic mouse expressing JDP2 specifically in the liver. We used diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection to initiate liver cancer in mice and assessed the extent of liver cancer in JDP2-transgenic and wild type control mice by biochemical and molecular biology techniques.
JDP2-transgenic mice display normal liver function. JDP2-transgenic mice displayed potentiation of liver cancer, higher mortality and increased number and size of tumors. The expression of JDP2 at the promotion stage was found to be the most critical for enhancing liver cancer severity.
This study suggests that JDP2 expression may play a critical role in liver cancer development by potentiating the compensatory proliferative response and increased inflammation in the DEN liver cancer model.
Cloxacillin was not listed as one of the drugs causing the acute interstitial nephritis, yet. A case of a 50-year female patient treated with cloxacillin is presented. Therapy was followed by nausea, vomiting, myalgia and arthralgia, and the symptoms of the acute renal failure which completely diminished after prednisone therapy despite of co-existing peptic ulcer. Low doses of corticosteroids seem helpful in the treatment of the acute interstitial nephritis following therapy with cloxacillin even after a long time of the onset.
Conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of malignant melanoma has been disappointingly ineffective. Although the most active single agent is dacarbazine, numerous trials support the activity of platinum analogs against melanoma. Several recent trials also demonstrate the single-agent activity of paclitaxel, and support the administration of these agents together in the treatment of a number of solid tumors. We conducted a phase II study treating patients with metastatic melanoma with paclitaxel as a 3-hour infusion of 175 mg/m2, and carboplatin dosed to yield an area under the curve of 7.5 administered during 30 minutes. Patients were previously untreated or treated once with a regimen not including a platinum or taxane agent and had a performance status of 0 or 1. Seventeen patients (8 males; 9 females; average age 51) were enrolled. Thirty-three percent of patients had disease involving the skin, 40% lungs, 33% lymph nodes, 26% liver, and 13% other visceral organs. Anaphylactic reactions developed in two patients associated with paclitaxel infusion, and the patients were subsequently taken off the study. Of the 15 remaining patients, 3 (20%) had partial responses, 7 (47%) had stable disease, and 5 (33%) showed evidence of progressive disease. Eleven patients experienced grade III or IV hematologic toxicity. All treatment-related toxicities were reversible. There were no treatment-related deaths. The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin has moderate activity against malignant melanoma, with expected reversible hematologic toxicities. Although not prospectively compared with single agents, the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin may be a treatment option for some patients. Comparisons with other treatment regimens and the search for additional active compounds against melanoma are needed.
To explore that the arsenic trioxide injection (ATI) has the effect in antagonizing adhesion and invasion of human hepatocarcinoma cells (HCC), and its relevant mechanism.
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 and the high metastatic nude mice human HCC in situ transplantation model was taken as the objects of study, the effects of ATI on the SMMC-7721 cell movement and migration, its adhesion with fibronectin (FN) and endothelial cell (EC), as well as the CD44 and MMP-2 gene protein expression in transplanted tumor of the model mice were observed by means of cell movement and migration test, cell adhesion test and immunohistochemical method.
ATI could significantly inhibit SMMC-7721 cell movement and migration on FN, adhesion with FN and EC, also could lower CD44 and MMP-2 in cancer cells.
ATI has the effects of antagonizing hepatocarcinoma cell adhesion and invasion, the mechanism may be related with the action of ATI in lowering CD44 and MMP-2 expression in cancer cells.
In rats with experimental thiopental coma rectal temperature decreased by 9.4 degrees C, oxygen consumption 5-fold, and arteriovenous Po(2)gradient decreased 2-fold within 3 h; CO(2)accumulated in the blood and mixed type acidosis developed. Administration of sodium succinate under these conditions increased arteriovenous Po(2)gradient and reduced manifestations of metabolic acidosis. Maintenance of normal body temperature (warming) corrected primarily manifestations of respiratory acidosis. Each therapeutic agent reduced inhibition of O(2)consumption by 1/4; animal survival tended to increase from 42 to 50%. Combined use of these treatments potentiated the antiacidotic effect and increased survival to 92%. The authors conclude that hypothermia inhibits the therapeutic effect of succinate in barbiturate coma.
Patients developing neuroleptic-induced akathisia have been reported to show higher levels of psychopathology. We sought to replicate this finding and determine its symptom specificity. We confirmed a significant relationship between ratings of akathisia and total score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) during both acute and maintenance neuroleptic treatment. Using stepwise regression models, BPRS anxious-depressive subscale scores were the strongest predictors of akathisia during both treatment conditions. Paranoid subscale scores predicted akathisia only during maintenance treatment. These results suggest that neuroleptic-induced dysphoria largely explains the relationship between akathisia and residual psychopathology during both acute and maintenance neuroleptic treatment.
Bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of osteoporosis. Although evidence supports a good safety profile for these agents, numerous tolerability issues have been associated with their use. This review provides an overview of the safety issues associated with the nitrogen-containing class of bisphosphonates and discusses the potential effect of these issues on adherence. The review specifically considers upper gastrointestinal (UGI) adverse events (AEs), renal toxicity, influenza-like illness, osteonecrosis of the jaw and evidence on how to treat or prevent these events. In clinical trials, UGI AEs, including severe events such as oesophageal ulcer, oesophagitis and erosive oesophagitis, have been reported at similar frequencies in placebo- and active-treatment arms. However, postmarketing studies have highlighted UGI AEs as a concern. These studies show that a significant portion of patients are less compliant with administration instructions outside strict clinical trial supervision, and when oral bisphosphonates are not administered as directed, patients are more likely to experience UGI AEs. Some clinical trials with oral bisphosphonates have suggested that a decrease in the frequency of administration may lead to improvement in gastrointestinal tolerability. In the authors' experience, the issue of UGI tolerability can be minimised by explaining to the patient and/or caregiver the importance of following administration instructions. Intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates have been recently approved for use in osteoporosis, offering an alternative regimen for patients with osteoporosis. Earlier generation IV bisphosphonates (e.g. etidronate) have been associated with acute renal failure. Alternatively, late-generation IV bisphosphonates (i.e. ibandronate) have shown a better safety profile in relation to renal toxicity. Influenza-like illness, often referred to as an acute-phase reaction, covers symptoms such as fatigue, fever, chills, myalgia and arthralgia. These symptoms are transitory and self-limiting and usually do not recur after subsequent drug administration. Symptoms of influenza-like illness have been associated with both IV and oral bisphosphonates. Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been associated with IV bisphosphonate treatment, particularly in patients treated with high doses. A small number of patients with cancer and osteoporosis using oral bisphosphonates have also reported this AE. As osteonecrosis of the jaw is difficult to treat and is often associated with dental procedures and poor oral hygiene, preventive measures seem to be the best management option for patients taking bisphosphonates.Overall, the safety and tolerability profile of the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates is good, and long-term treatment does not appear to carry a risk of serious AEs. By encouraging adherence to administration instructions physicians can minimise certain complications, such as UGI intolerability. By being aware of other potential safety issues, such as renal impairment, influenza-like illness and osteonecrosis of the jaw, physicians can detect these AEs early in the course of treatment.
Recent advances in schizophrenia (SZ) research indicate that the telencephalic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission deficit associated with this psychiatric disorder probably is mediated by the hypermethylation of the glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD(67)), reelin and other GABAergic promoters. A pharmacological strategy to reduce the hypermethylation of GABAergic promoters is to induce a DNA-cytosine demethylation by altering the chromatin remodeling with valproate (VPA). When co-administered with VPA, the clinical efficacy of atypical antipsychotics is enhanced. This prompted us to investigate whether this increase in drug efficacy is related to a modification of GABAergic-promoter methylation via chromatin remodeling. Our previous and present results strongly indicate that VPA facilitates chromatin remodeling when it is associated with clozapine or sulpiride but not with haloperidol or olanzapine. This remodeling might contribute to reelin- and GAD(67)-promoter demethylation and might reverse the GABAergic-gene-expression downregulation associated with SZ morbidity.
Chronic cocaine users can have as much as a 69% increase in left ventricular muscle mass without associated increases in arterial blood pressure, heart rate, renin, aldosterone, or cortisol. We determined whether cocaine directly increases cardiomyocyte protein content and whether protein kinase C is important in this process.
Adult rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and grown in cultures. In Series I experiments, cocaine, 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, or vehicle, in the absence or presence of phentolamine or metoprolol, was added to each culture and the cells were subsequently harvested. In Series II, cocaine, 10(-6) M, cocaine, 10(-6) M, plus bisindolylmaleimide, 10(-6) M, a protein kinase C inhibitor, or vehicle were added to each culture and the cells subsequently harvested. We determined the total protein content, the content of alpha-myosin and fetal beta-myosin heavy-chain protein, and the presence of protein kinase C isoforms in the cardiomyocyte soluble and particulate fractions. Protein kinase C translocation from the soluble to particulate fraction is indicative of activation. In Series III, we determined the cocaine effects on ERK, SAPK/JNK, and p38. In Series I, cocaine, 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, dose-dependently increased myocyte protein content by as much as 28%+/-2% (P<.001) and fetal beta-myosin heavy-chain protein content by 80%+/-2% (P<.001). Neither phentolamine nor metoprolol inhibited this process. In Series II, we determined that ventricular myocytes contain alpha (alpha), beta (beta), delta (delta), epsilon (epsilon), and zeta (zeta) protein kinase C isoforms. Cocaine, 10(-6) M, caused a 45+/-5% increase (P<.001) in protein kinase Calpha in the particulate fraction. The addition of a protein kinase C inhibitor to the myocyte cultures prevented the cocaine-induced translocation of protein kinase Calpha and limited the increase in beta-myosin heavy-chain protein content by >75% (P<.001). However, cocaine did not increase the phosphorylation of ERK, SAPK/JNK or p38 in Series III.
Cocaine increases adult cardiomyocyte protein content by protein kinase Calpha-dependent mechanisms, and this process can contribute to the cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy that results from chronic cocaine use.
A 14-year-old boy with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) developed, under fluvoxamine treatment, acute symptoms of Tourette's syndrome (TS) with aggravation of the OCD. The TS symptoms did not respond to dopamine blockers and disappeared only after withdrawal of fluvoxamine. Readministration of fluvoxamine caused a re-emergence of the same symptoms.
Peripheral opioid analgesia is well documented. But the clinical usefulness of intra-articular morphine after surgery is uncertain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the analgesic effects of intra-articular morphine after knee arthroscopy.
In this parallel-group, double-blind study, 90 patients were randomised to receive either morphine 1 mg, morphine 2 mg or placebo in 5 ml saline intra-articularly at the end of arthroscopic knee surgery. Anaesthetic technique was local infiltration and intra-articular injection of lidocaine. Analgesic efficacy was evaluated by a global pain score, pain intensity (visual analogue scale), and analgesic requirements (paracetamol) during the first 48 h postoperatively.
No significant differences between the groups were found for any of the efficacy variables. A majority of the patients had mild pain throughout the study, thus possibly compromising study sensitivity. In a subgroup with more intense pain early after arthroscopy, intra-articular morphine 2 mg reduced pain intensity (P < 0.05) and analgesic requirements (P < 0.05) compared with placebo.
Postoperative analgesic effect of intra-articular morphine was found only in a subgroup of patients with higher pain intensity in the immediate postanaesthetic period. Possible reasons for our overall negative findings include low study sensitivity due to weak pain stimulus, lack of inflammation that may be a prerequisite for peripheral opioid analgesia, and the local anaesthetic, which impedes local inflammatory reaction and expression of peripheral opioid receptors. These factors may also explain the conflicting results in other studies.
N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists reverse hyperalgesia during morphine infusion in male mice only. Because the melanocortin-1 receptor can act as a female-specific counterpart to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in kappa-opioid analgesic mechanisms, the authors assessed the contribution of melanocortin-1 receptors to the sex-specific mechanisms underlying morphine hyperalgesia.
The tail-withdrawal test was used to compare the nociceptive responses of male and female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with those of C57BL/6J-Mc(1r(e/e)) mice, spontaneous mutants of the B6 background lacking functional melanocortin-1 receptors, during continuous morphine infusion (1.6 and 40.0 mgkg(-1) . 24 h(-1)). Separate groups of hyperalgesic B6 and outbred CD-1 mice were injected with MK-801 or MSG606, selective N-methyl-D-aspartate and melanocortin-1 receptor antagonists, respectively.
Morphine infusion (40.0 mg . kg(-1) . 24 h(-1)) reduced baseline withdrawal latencies by 45-55% in B6 mice of both sexes, indicating hyperalgesia; this increased nociception was manifest in male e/e mice only. Although MK-801 reversed hyperalgesia in male mice only, increasing latencies by 72%, MSG606 increased latencies by approximately 60% exclusively in females. A lower morphine infusion dose (1.6 mg . kg(-1) . 24 h(-1)) reduced baseline withdrawal latencies by 45-52% in B6 and e/e mice of both sexes, which was reversed by MK-801, but not MSG606, in both male and female B6 mice.
The data indicate the sex-specific mediation of high-dose morphine-induced hyperalgesia by N-methyl-d-aspartate and melanocortin-1 receptors in male and female mice, respectively, suggesting a broader relevance of this known sexual dimorphism. The data further indicate that the neural substrates contributing to hyperalgesia are morphine dose-dependent.
