It has been suggested that pilocarpine-induced seizures is mediated by increases in oxidative stress. Current researches have suggested that antioxidant compounds may afford some level of neuroprotection against the neurotoxicity of seizures in cellular level. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of lipoic acid (LA) in rats, against the observed oxidative stress during seizures induced by pilocarpine. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group), LA (10 mg/kg, i.p., LA group), pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p., pilocarpine group), and the association of LA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) plus pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before of administration of LA (LA plus pilocarpine group). After the treatments all groups were observed for 6h. The enzyme activities as well as the lipid peroxidation and nitrite concentrations were measured using spectrophotometric methods and the results compared to values obtained from saline and pilocarpine-treated animals. Protective effects of LA were also evaluated on the same parameters. In pilocarpine group there was a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and nitrite level. However, no alteration was observed in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Antioxidant treatment significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation level and nitrite content as well as increased the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in hippocampus of rats after seizures induced by pilocarpine. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that oxidative stress in hippocampus occurs during seizures induced by pilocarpine, proving that brain damage induced by the oxidative process plays a crucial role in seizures pathogenic consequences, and also imply that strong protective effect could be achieved using lipoic acid as an antioxidant.
A method has been developed to measure the concentration of chloroquine in lysosomes isolated from the liver of rats. It employs 3H2O and [U-14C]sucrose to determine the intralysosomal water volume of purified lysosomes obtained by free flow electrophoresis. Twelve h after a single dose, the concentration of chloroquine in lysosomes was 6.3 mM and at 24 h it rose to 16.5 mM. With continued treatment, lysosomal chloroquine concentrations were 61 and 74 mM at 48 and 72 h. The lysosomal concentrations of chloroquine attained were sufficient to block intralysosomal phospholipase A1 activity. The lysosomal content of phospholipid rises 1.7-fold and 2.6-fold over that of control at 12 and 24 h, respectively. At 72 h, lysosomal phospholipid was 3.7-fold greater than that of control. Lysosomes show an increased negative surface charge with chloroquine administration which is due in part to an increased ratio of acidic to neutral phospholipids in the lysosomal membrane. The phosphatidylinositol content of lysosomes rose rapidly with chloroquine treatment and accounted for the early increase in the ratio. Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, an acidic phospholipid synthesized only in lysosomes, increased later in the course of chloroquine treatment and accounted for the continued increase in acidic phospholipids.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate behavioral responses and biochemical changes induced by the extensively used pesticide cypermethrin (CYP) in liver, gills, brain and muscle tissues of mahseer (Tor putitora) fry. Behavioral changes in fish after exposure to an acute concentration of CYP involved jumping, abrupt swimming, loss of balance and equilibrium, increased surface activity and air gulping. These changes were more prominent with the passage of time. After a longer period of exposure, the fish became sluggish and before dying occasionally became motionless and sometimes showed a vertical position. Internal hemorrhage was also obvious. CYP exposure resulted in a significant decrease in total protein content in different tissues while antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and glutathione reductase (GR) showed a time-dependent increasing trend in their activities in liver, brain, gills and muscle tissues. Similarly, lipid peroxidation (LPO) level also increased with time in different tissues of CYP-exposed fish. The results of the present study revealed that CYP is toxic to the mahseer Tor putitora. Therefore, its indiscriminate use can contribute in decreasing the population of mahseer in natural water bodies.
Most reports assessing the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone have involved patients previously treated with typical antipsychotics. Such patients are more likely to have a greater resistance or intolerance to treatment, thus restricting our interpretation of the impact a new treatment might have on the course of schizophrenia and possibly biasing the results. The present study examines the relative effectiveness of risperidone and typical antipsychotics in patients being treated for their first episode of schizophrenia.
From a cohort of 126 patients, 2 groups of 19 first-episode DSM-III-R/DSM-IV schizophrenia patients matched for age, gender, length of illness, and length of treatment and treated with either a typical antipsychotic or risperidone for a minimum of 1 year were compared on a number of outcome dimensions during their course of treatment and at follow-up. Treatment allocation was not random, and patients were judged to be compliant with medication. Patients treated with typical antipsychotics were followed up for a statistically nonsignificantly longer time (mean = 2.7 vs. 1.9 years).
Six patients (31.6%) from the typical antipsychotic group were admitted to the hospital within the first year following the index admission compared with 1 patient (5.3%) in the risperidone group (admitted at month 14). Patients in the risperidone group showed a statistically significantly lower length of first hospitalization (p < .01), utilization of inpatient beds during the course of treatment (p < .001), and use of anticholinergic medication (p < .05). There were no statistically significant differences in symptom levels, either during the course of treatment or at follow-up; in the use of antidepressant, antianxiety, or mood-stabilizing drugs; or in changes in living circumstances or employment.
These findings confirm at least equal long-term efficacy of typical antipsychotics and risperidone, but a possible advantage for risperidone in decreased service utilization and decreased use of anticholinergic drugs.
The present report was designed to determine the antigenotoxic capacity of beta-caryophyllene (BC) on the damage induced by benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) in mouse. We found no genotoxic potential of BC, and a significant inhibitory effect on the number of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations induced by BaP. The three tested doses of the agent (20, 200, and 2,000 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease of the two evaluated cytogenetic parameters. In comparison with the effect induced by BaP, the best inhibitory effect (about 80%) was obtained with the high tested dose of BC considering the two evaluated parameters. Other aim of the study was to explore whether in this effect participated the BC antioxidant capacity and/or its effect as inducer of GST activity. We found a dose-dependent decrease induced by BC in regard to both the oxidation of lipids and proteins produced by BaP.In the case of GST, when BC was administered alone we found a mean increase of 64% of the enzyme activity, respect to the control level, and when BC was administered in mice treated with BaP the increase obtained with the high dose of BC reached 27%. Therefore, our data established no in vivo genotoxicity by BC, and a significant antigenotoxic potential of the compound, which may be related with its capacity to block the molecular oxidation and to stimulate the GST activity.
To investigate the effect of propofol and isoflurane on surgical stress response and postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients.
Sixty elderly patients scheduled for elective upper abdominal surgery with general anesthesia were randomized equally into propofol group and isoflurane group. The surgical stress response, postoperative Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and the rate of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) were compared between the two groups.
The surgical stress response in propofol group was relatively stable. Compared with isoflurane group, the patients in propofol group showed significantly faster recovery of the MMSE scores with also lower rate of POCD.
Compared with isoflurane, propofol intravenous anesthesia is associated with rapid recovery of the cognitive function, stable surgical stress response and reduced adverse effects in elderly patients.
Recent studies have shown that epigenetic alterations correlate with carcinogenesis in various tissues. Identification of these alterations might help characterize the early stages of carcinogenesis. We comprehensively analyzed DNA methylation and gene expression in livers obtained from rats exposed to nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) followed by a promoter of hepatic carcinogenesis, phenobarbital (PB). The combination of DEN and PB induced marked increases in number and area of glutathione S-transferase-placental form (GST-P)-positive foci in the liver. In the liver of rats that received 30 mg/kg of DEN, pathway analysis revealed alterations of common genes in terms of gene expression and DNA methylation, and that these alterations were related to immune responses. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the expression of common genes from public data obtained through the Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation system (TG-GATEs) showed that carcinogenic compounds clustered together. MBD-seq and GeneChip analysis indicated that major histocompatibility complex class Ib gene RT1-CE5, which has an important role in antigen presentation, was hypomethylated around the promoter region and specifically induced in the livers of DEN-treated rats. Further, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the co-localization of GST-P and protein homologous to RT1-CE5 was present at the foci of some regions. These results suggest that common genes were altered in terms of both DNA methylation and expression in livers, with preneoplastic foci indicating carcinogenic potential, and that immune responses are involved in early carcinogenesis. In conclusion, the present study identified a specific profile of DNA methylation and gene expression in livers with preneoplastic foci. Early epigenetic perturbations of immune responses might correlate with the early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis.
Molecular factors involved in apoptosis may affect breast cancer response to chemotherapy. Herein, we studied the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)/bcl-2 pathway to determine whether or not activation of this antiapoptotic pathway was associated with a poor response of human breast cancer to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
We studied 82 human breast cancer samples from patients treated with neoadjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy and studied whether or not nuclear location of the transcription factor NF-kappaB was associated with expression of bcl-2 and bax and whether or not expression of these proteins correlated with chemotherapy response. Protein expression was measured with immunohistochemical staining. A dedicated breast cancer pathologist who was unaware of the clinical outcome data dichotomized the slides as positive or negative based on the presence or absence of cytoplasmic staining for bcl-2 and bax or nuclear staining for NF-kappaB.
Sixty-one percent of the tumors were positive for bcl-2, 85% were positive for bax, and 16% were positive for NF-kappaB. All bcl-2-positive tumors were also bax positive (P < 0.0001) and all NF-kappaB-positive tumors were both bcl-2 positive (P = 0.001) and bax positive (P = 0.113). Eleven of the 82 patients (13%) had a pathologic complete response (pCR) to chemotherapy. Patients with positive staining tumors for any of the markers less commonly achieved a pCR to chemotherapy than those with negative tumor staining. The pCR rates were NF-kappaB positive 0% (0 of 13) versus NF-kappaB negative 13% (11 of 69; P = 0.130); bcl-2 positive 4% (2 of 49) versus bcl-2 negative 27% (9 of 33; P = 0.004); and bax positive 6% (4 of 69) versus bax negative 58% (7 of 12; P < 0.001).
We conclude that nuclear localization of NF-kappaB correlates with bcl-2 and bax expression and that the NF-kappaB/bcl-2 pathway may be associated with a poor response to neoadjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy.
Following our long-standing interest in the mechanisms involved in selenium toxicity, the aim of this work was to extend our previous studies to gain a better understanding of mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) + diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)₂ toxicity. Mice received one daily dose of HgCl₂ (4.6 mg kg(-1) , subcutaneously) for three consecutive days. Thirty minutes after the last injection of HgCl₂, mice received a single dose of (PhSe)₂ (31.2 mg kg(-1) , subcutaneously). Five hours after (PhSe)₂ administration, mice were euthanized and δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase, catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and Na(+) , K(+) -ATPase activities as well as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), ascorbic acid and mercury levels were determined in kidney and liver. Parameters in plasma (urea, creatinine, protein and erythropoietin), whole blood (hematocrit and hemoglobin) and urine (protein) were also investigated. HgCl₂ + (PhSe)₂ exposure caused a decrease in renal GST and Na(+) , K(+) -ATPase activities and an increase in renal ascorbic acid and TBARS concentrations when compared with the HgCl₂ group. (PhSe)₂ potentiated the increase in plasma urea caused by HgCl₂. HgCl₂ + (PhSe)₂ exposure caused a reduction in plasma protein levels and an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit contents when compared with the HgCl₂ group. There was a significant reduction in hepatic CAT activity and an increase in TBARS levels in mice exposed to HgCl₂ + (PhSe)₂ when compared with the HgCl₂ group. The results demonstrated that (PhSe)₂ did not modify mercury levels in mice. In conclusion, (PhSe)₂ potentiated damage caused by HgCl₂ affecting mainly the renal tissue.
A bioassay of 5-nitroacenaphthene for possible carcinogenicity was conducted using Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. 5-Nitroacenaphthene was administered in the feed, at either of two concentrations, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals of each species. For male and female rats, the high and low dietary concentrations of 5-nitroacenaphthene were 0.24 and 0.12 percent, respectively. The high and low time-weighted average concentrations for mice were 0.12 and 0.06 percent, respectively, for males and 0.12 and 0.05 percent, respectively, for females. After a 78-week dosing period, observation of surviving rats continued for up to 22 weeks and observation of the mice continued for 18 weeks. For the chronic rat bioassay, 49 male and 50 female rats were placed on test as high dose controls, and 50 rats of each sex served as low dose controls. For the mice, 50 males and 50 females were placed on test as controls. Accelerated mortality was observed in all dosed groups except the low dose female mice. There was a positive association between mortality and dietary concentration of 5-nitroacenaphthene for both sexes of both species. Early deaths were most apparent among high dose male mice; half of the animals in this group were dead by week 20 and insufficient male mice survived to be at risk from late-developing tumors. Among rats, the incidence of malignant tumors of the ear canal (incidences of ceruminous carcinomas and squamous-cell carcinomas were combined) was significant at each dose level in each sex. Among both dosed groups of female rats, the incidence of clitoral gland carcinoma and the incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma were significant. A significant incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinoma was observed in low dose rat groups of each sex. Among female mice, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was significant at each dose level. The combined incidence of granulosa-cell tumors, luteomas, and tubular-cell adenomas of the ovary was significant in the high dose female mouse group. Under the conditions of this bioassay, 5-nitroacenaphthene was carcinogenic to Fischer 344 rats, causing increased incidences of malignant tumors of the ear canal and lung in both sexes, and of the clitoral gland and mammary gland in females. 5-Nitroacenaphthene was also carcinogenic to female but not male B6C3F1, mice, causing carcinomas of the liver and ovarian tumors.
Hexachloro-1:3-butadiene (HCBD) causes kidney injury specific to the pars recta of the proximal tubule. In the present studies, injury to the nephron was characterized at 24 h following a single dose of HCBD, using a range of quantitative urinary measurements, renal histopathology and gene expression. Multiplexed renal biomarker measurements were performed using both the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) and Rules Based Medicine platforms. In a second study, rats were treated with a single nephrotoxic dose of HCBD and the time course release of a range of traditional and newer urinary biomarkers was followed over a 25 day period. Urinary albumin (a marker of both proximal tubular function and glomerular integrity) and α-glutathione S-transferase (α-GST, a proximal tubular cell marker of cytoplasmic leakage) showed the largest fold change at 24 h (day 1) after dosing. Most other markers measured on either the MSD or RBM platforms peaked on day 1 or 2 post-dosing, whereas levels of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), a marker of tubular regeneration, peaked on day 3/4. Therefore, in rat proximal tubular nephrotoxicity, the measurement of urinary albumin, α-GST and KIM-1 is recommended as they potentially provide useful information about the function, degree of damage and repair of the proximal tubule. Gene expression data provided useful confirmatory information regarding exposure of the kidney and liver to HCBD, and the response of these tissues to HCBD in terms of metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and regeneration and repair.
This study compared the haemodynamic effects of subarachnoid block with plain bupivacaine 0.5% (dextrose-free), heavy bupivacaine 0.5% (in dextrose 8%) and a mixture of these two solutions, i.e. bupivacaine 0.5% in dextrose 4%. Thirty-six male patients, aged 55-89 years, undergoing transurethral surgery were recruited. Invasive systolic arterial and central venous pressures were recorded at 5-s intervals after the block was initiated using a computerised data-collection system. The height of sensory blockade was recorded at 5-min intervals. No preload was given and episodes of hypotension were treated with colloid (8 ml x kg(-1)) and, if this was ineffective, a metaraminol infusion. Systolic arterial and central venous pressures decreased in all three groups following block (p < 0.05). These decreases were more rapid in onset in the heavy bupivacaine group compared with plain bupivacaine group (p < 0.005). Patients in the heavy bupivacaine group also had a greater requirement for early treatment of hypotension (< 10 min) and treatment with metaraminol (p < 0.05). The onset of sensory blockade was more rapid in the heavy group compared with the mixed group, although final sensory levels were similar. The onset of haemodynamic and sensory changes are more rapid when using heavy bupivacaine intrathecally. This leads to a higher and earlier incidence of hypotension and requirement for treatment.
We describe a patient with early post-surgical infective endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, who was unsuitable for surgical reintervention and who failed standard antistaphylococcal therapy, but was successfully cured with a sequential regimen including quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid.
Epidemiological studies have established the role of cigarette smoking as a risk factor in the progression of chronic kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy. We have previously reported that nicotine promotes mesangial cell proliferation and hypertrophy via activation of nonneuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and that nicotine worsens renal injury in a model of acute glomerulonephritis (Jaimes E, Tian RX, Raij L. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 292: H76-H82, 2007; Jaimes EA, Tian RX, Joshi M, Raij L. Am J Nephrol 29: 319-326, 2009). These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that nicotine worsens renal injury in db/db mice, a well-established model of diabetic nephropathy, and that reactive oxygen species play an important as mediators of these effects. For these studies, nicotine (100 μg/ml) was administered in the drinking water to control and db/db mice for 10 wk. Blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method, and urine was collected for proteinuria. At death, kidneys were collected for histology and molecular biology. The administration of nicotine did not result in significant changes in blood pressure or blood glucose and resulted in cotinine levels similar to those found in the plasma of smokers. In diabetic mice, the administration of nicotine significantly increased urinary protein excretion (1-fold), glomerular hypertrophy, and mesangial area (∼20%). These changes were accompanied by significant increases in NADPH oxidase 4 (∼30%) and increased nitrotyrosine and Akt expression. In vitro, we determined that nicotine has additive effects to high glucose on reactive oxygen species generation and Akt phosphorylation in human mesangial cells. These findings unveil novel mechanisms that may result in the development of novel strategies in the treatment and prevention of diabetic nephropathy in smokers.
AWD 12-281 (N-(3,5-dichloro-4-pyridinyl)-2-[1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl]-2-oxoacetamide), a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, which is optimized for topical administration, was tested in a model of allergic dermatitis in mice. To obtain an allergic dermatitis, BALB/c mice were sensitized to toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI). The allergic reaction was challenged by topical administration of TDI onto the mice ears. AWD 12-281 was tested for its anti-inflammatory potential by oral, intraperitoneal and topical administration. The phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, cilomilast (SB 207499), and/or the corticosteroid, diflorasone diacetate, were used as reference compounds. Given orally and intraperitoneally 2 h before as well as 5 and 24 h after TDI challenge, AWD 12-281 showed no, or only a transient inhibition of the allergen-induced ear swelling, whereas cilomilast significantly inhibited this ear swelling. Applied topically onto the ears before TDI challenge, AWD 12-281, cilomilast and diflorasone diacetate caused total inhibition of ear swelling 24 h after challenge, confirmed by a decrease of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4, interleukin-6 and macrophage inhibitory protein-2. Administered topically after TDI challenge as therapeutic intervention, AWD 12-281 and diflorasone diacetate caused significant inhibition of ear swelling; cilomilast failed to do so. These results indicate that topically administered AWD 12-281 may be potent in the prevention and treatment of allergic/inflammatory skin diseases.
The effects of four antitussives, including codeine phosphate (CP), moguisteine, levodropropizine (LVDP) and naringin, on airway neurogenic inflammation and enhanced cough were investigated in guinea pig model of chronic cough.
Guinea pigs were exposed to CS for 8 weeks. At the 7th and 8th week, the animals were treated with vehicle, CP (4.8 mg/kg), moguisteine (24 mg/kg), LVDP (14 mg/kg) and naringin (18.4 mg/kg) respectively. Then the cough and the time-enhanced pause area under the curve (Penh-AUC) during capsaicin challenge were recorded. The substance P (SP) content, NK-1 receptor expression and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity in lung were determined.
Chronic CS exposure induced a bi-phase time course of cough responsiveness to capsaicin. Eight weeks of CS exposure significantly enhanced the airway neurogenic inflammation and cough response in guinea pigs. Two weeks of treatment with CP, moguisteine, LVDP or naringin effectively attenuated the chronic CS-exposure enhanced cough. Only naringin exerted significant effect on inhibiting Penh-AUC, SP content and NK-1 receptor expression, as well as preventing the declining of NEP activity in lung.
Chronic CS-exposed guinea pig is suitable for studying chronic pathological cough, in which naringin is effective on inhibiting both airway neurogenic inflammation and enhanced cough.
Both the biochemical modulation and the continuous administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have achieved promising results in patients with gastric carcinoma. Conversely, several studies on gastric carcinoma have demonstrated that the combination of etoposide (VP-16), leucovorin (LV), and 5-FU (ELF) is efficacious and moderately toxic. UFT is a combination of uracil and tegafur (ftorafur) in a 4:1 molar ratio. It can be administered orally for several weeks, thus stimulating the effects of a continuous infusion of 5-FU. Its combination with LV increased the efficacy of UFT. We conducted a Phase II study on patients with gastric carcinoma using the combination VP-16-LV-UFT. This combination is administered mainly orally (p.o) and could yield a good response rate and low toxicity.
Forty-six patients with bidimensionally measurable disease were entered into the study. Patients received VP-16 100 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 and 200 mg/ m2 p.o. on Days 2 and 3; LV 500 mg/m2 administered intravenously (i.v.) on Day 1, followed by p.o. LV 15 mg every twelve hours on Days 2 to 14. Patients also received UFT p.o. 390 mg/m2/day on Days 1 to 14. Treatment was repeated every 28 days for a minimum of 3 courses per patient. All courses were given on an outpatient basis.
Four patients (9%) had a complete response, and 12 a partial response (26%) for an overall response rate of 35% (95% confidence interval: 22-51%). The median duration of response was 10 months. The median overall survival was 9 months. The main side effects were gastrointestinal. Grade 3 to 4 toxicity was encountered as follows: diarrhea in 17% of the patients, nausea/vomiting in 11%, anemia in 13%, mucositis and leukopenia in 4% each, and thrombocytopenia in 2%. One patient died of sepsis and neutropenia.
VP-16-LV-UFT has an activity comparable to that of other schemes and a low incidence of side effects. Furthermore, since it is administered mainly orally, hospitalization is avoided, which makes this scheme suitable for patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.
The aim of this study was to examine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) may be used to study regional myocardial blood flow distribution during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia. MCE was performed before and after dipyridamole infusion in 11 patients with a proximal, significant left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis. The relation between contrast-derived parameters and the degree of coronary narrowing and the occurrence of transient regional wall motion abnormalities was also investigated. In the territory supplied by left circumflex coronary artery, mean peak contrast intensity increased after dipyridamole from 50 +/- 18 to 76 +/- 27 IU (p < 0.001). In contrast, a significant reduction in mean peak intensity was observed after dipyridamole in the LAD territory (from 41 +/- 27 to 13 +/- 13 IU, p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained with the use of the area under the time-intensity curve. An increase in peak intensity > or = 10 IU after dipyridamole administration separated normal regions from those supplied by a significant coronary artery lesion with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 91%. Perfusion abnormalities were always detected by contrast echocardiography when septal motion abnormalities developed and, in five patients they were detected in the absence of clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic signs of ischemia. A weak correlation was found between both peak intensity and area under the curve and percent coronary diameter stenosis and cross-sectional area. In conclusion, dipyridamole MCE can be used during routine coronary angiography to assess myocardial blood flow distribution in patients with coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
A total of 20 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) received the anti-retroviral drug 2',3',dideoxycytidine in a phase I study at doses ranging from 0.03 mg/kg every 8 hours to 0.25 mg/kg every 8 hours. Of the 11 patients who participated in the study for more than 5 weeks, 9 developed symptoms and signs of a mainly sensory painful neuropathy that was confirmed by electromyography to be mixed sensory and motor neuropathy of axonal type. The neuropathy which developed on dideoxycytidine occurred between 9 and 12 weeks of treatment. One patient, who had the drug stopped at 3 weeks owing to thrombocytopenia, developed a similar clinical picture of a sensory peripheral neuropathy after 2 weeks off dideoxycytidine. However, he did not have electromyographic evidence of a neuropathy, and he subsequently returned to normal clinically while taking a lower dose of dideoxycytidine in an alternating regimen. Five patients were withdrawn from the study because of the neuropathy. The pattern of this neuropathy was different from that of the slowly progressive painful neuropathy of AIDS, in that there was (1) a sudden onset of intense burning discomfort in both feet sparing the hands at about the tenth week (mean 10.4 weeks) of treatment, (2) there was motor involvement in some patients without progression, and (3) onset of the neuropathy was temporally related to the administration of dideoxycytidine and began to resolve 3-5 weeks after its discontinuation. We believe that dideoxycytidine can be an axonal toxin, especially when given in high dose continuous regimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The anti-seizure effect of oleamide, an endogenous sleep-inducing fatty acid amide, was studied in mice. Oleamide, in the dose range 43.7-700.0 mg kg(-1), significantly and dose-dependently inhibited the seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole. However, oleamide showed no inhibitory action on the seizures induced by picrotoxin, strychnine, caffeine or semicarbazide. These results provide the first evidence for the anti-seizure effect of oleamide, and suggest that this effect may be selective to the seizure model induced by pentylenetetrazole.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that play an important role in the regulation of genes involved in lipid utilization and storage, lipoprotein metabolism, adipocyte differentiation, and insulin action. The three isoforms of the PPAR family, i.e. alpha, delta, and gamma, have distinct tissue distribution patterns. PPAR-alpha is predominantly present in the liver, and PPAR-gamma in adipose tissue, whereas PPAR-delta is ubiquitously expressed. A recent study reported increased PPAR-gamma messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the liver in ob/ob mice; however, it is not known whether increased PPAR-gamma expression in the liver has any functional consequences. The expression of PPAR-alpha and -delta in the liver in obesity has not been determined. We have now examined the mRNA levels of PPAR-alpha, -delta, and -gamma in three murine models of obesity, namely, ob/ob (leptin-deficient), db/db (leptin-receptor deficient), and serotonin 5-HT2c receptor (5-HT2cR) mutant mice. 5-HT2cR mutant mice develop a late-onset obesity that is associated with higher plasma leptin levels. Our results show that PPAR-alpha mRNA levels in the liver are increased by 2- to 3-fold in all three obese models, whereas hepatic PPAR-gamma mRNA levels are increased by 7- to 9-fold in ob/ob and db/db mice and by 2-fold in obese 5-HT2cR mutant mice. PPAR-delta mRNA expression is not altered in ob/ob or db/db mice. To determine whether increased PPAR-gamma expression in the liver has any functional consequences, we examined the effect of troglitazone treatment on the hepatic mRNA levels of several PPAR-gamma-responsive adipose tissue-specific genes that have either no detectable or very low basal expression in the liver. The treatment of lean control mice with troglitazone significantly increased the expression of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) and fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) in the liver. This troglitazone-induced increase in the expression of aP2 and FAT/CD36 was markedly enhanced in the liver in ob/ob mice. Troglitazone also induced a pronounced increase in the expression of uncoupling protein-2 in the liver in ob/ob mice. In contrast to the liver, troglitazone did not increase the expression of aP2, FAT/CD36, and uncoupling protein-2 in adipose tissue in lean or ob/ob mice. Taken together, our results suggest that the effects of PPAR-gamma activators on lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in obesity and type 2 diabetes may be partly mediated through their effects on PPAR-gamma in the liver.
alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein of pregnancy associated with a decrease in lifetime risk of breast cancer in parous women. A synthetic, cyclic nonapeptide has been developed that mimics the antioncogenic active site of AFP. To test the hypothesis that the AFP-derived peptide (AFPep) can prevent breast cancer, the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced breast cancer model was used in rats.
AFPep was given daily by injection beginning 10 days after N-methyl-N-nitrosourea treatment and continued for 23 days (a time designed to mimic pregnancy) or for other times to assess efficacy as a function of drug duration. Tumor incidence, multiplicity, and latency were noted as end points. At necropsy, pathology analysis of tumors and major organs were obtained.
AFPep prevented cancer in a dose-dependent fashion. Significantly longer mean tumor-free days (P < 0.02), lower tumor incidence (P = 0.004), and lower tumor multiplicity were observed for AFPep-treated groups. No evidence of host toxicity as measured by body weight, cage activity, fur texture, and organ weights (liver, uterus, heart, kidney, and spleen) were found in animals treated with AFPep. Mechanistic studies using transplantable human breast cancer xenografts showed that the peptide interfered with estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth inhibited the phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor and activated phosphorylation of p53.
AFPep is a well-tolerated, mechanistically novel, chemopreventive agent in models of breast cancer and warrants further development for the prevention and treatment of this disease in humans.
It has been suggested that the increase in serotonin transmission induced by indirect agonists such as fenfluramine and fluoxetine attenuates cue-elicited reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in rats through a 5-HT2C receptor-dependent mechanism.
We investigated whether Ro 60-0175, a nonselective 5-HT2B-2C agonist, influences cue-elicited reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. We evaluated the 5-HT2C receptor's role in Ro 60-0175 by studying its interaction with SB-242,084, a selective 5-HT2C antagonist. The study also explored whether Ro 60-0175 influences cue-elicited seeking behavior associated with sucrose, a highly palatable nutritive reinforcer.
Different groups of free-feeding rats were trained to associate discriminative stimuli (SDs) with the availability of cocaine or a sucrose pellet or no-reward in two-lever operant cages. Cocaine and sucrose pellets were available under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement, and each reinforcer was followed by a 20-s timeout signaled by a cue light coming above the active lever. After extinction of reinforced responding in the absence of cue, the reinforcer-associated stimuli were reintroduced in reinstatement sessions in which reinforcers were withheld.
Ro 60-0175, at IP doses from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg, dose-dependently reduced cocaine-seeking behavior, while 1 mg/kg had no such effect for the sucrose pellet. Pretreatment with 1 mg/kg SC SB-242,084 completely prevented the effect on cocaine-seeking behavior.
These findings, provided they can be extrapolated to abstinent human addicts, suggest therapeutic potential for the selective 5-HT2C agonist in preventing cue-controlled cocaine-seeking and relapse.
Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) is characterized by severe asthmatic attack after ingestion of aspirin and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Prostaglandin E2 receptor (PTGER) gene family polymorphisms and AIA in 243 AIA patients and 919 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) controls of Korean ethnicity in two separate study cohorts. After genotyping 120 SNPs of the PTGER gene family for the 1(st) cohort study, four SNPs in PTGER1, ten in PTGER3, six in PTGER3, and a haplotype of PTGER2 showed association signals with decreased or increased risk of AIA. Among the positively associated SNPs, one in PTGER1 and four in PTGER3 were analyzed in the 2(nd) cohort study. The results show that rs7543182 and rs959 in PTGER3 retained their effect, although no statistical significance was retained in the 2(nd) cohort study. Our findings provide further evidence that polymorphisms in PTGER3 might play a significant role in aspirin hypersensitivity among Korean asthmatics.
Total blindness with a transient tonic pupillary response, denervation supersensitivity, and abnormal visual-evoked potentials developed in a 54-year-old man after the use of quinine sulfate for leg cramps. He later recovered normal visual acuity. A transient tonic pupillary response, denervation supersensitivity, and abnormal visual-evoked potentials in quinine toxicity, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported.
Intravitreal administration of ganciclovir has been used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who are unable to tolerate systemic antiviral therapy. Although retinal toxicity from intravitreal ganciclovir has been observed in animal experiments, to our knowledge, retinal toxicity from intravitreal ganciclovir has not been reported in humans.
A case of inadvertent intravitreous injection of a high dose of ganciclovir (40 mg/0.1 ml) for CMV retinitis in a patient with AIDS is presented.
Despite immediate intervention with vitreous surgery, permanent retinal damage and visual loss developed. Clinical observations and photographic documentation are provided.
Retinal toxicity can occur from a high-dose intravitreal ganciclovir injection. This toxicity may result from the high alkaline nature of this preparation, from osmotic damage, or from a direct effect of the concentrated ganciclovir.
The Notch signaling pathway is a critical embryonic developmental regulatory pathway that has been implicated in oncogenesis. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), recent evidence suggests that Notch signaling may contribute to maintenance of a cancer stem or progenitor cell compartment required for tumorigenesis. We explored whether intact Notch signaling is required for NSCLC clonogenic and tumorigenic potential in vitro and in vivo using a series of genetically modified model systems. In keeping with previous observations, we find that Notch3 in particular is upregulated in human lung cancer lines and that downregulation of Notch signaling using a selective γ-secretase inhibitor (MRK-003) is associated with decreased proliferation and clonogenic capacity in vitro. We show that this phenotype is rescued with the expression of NICD3, a constitutively active cleaved form of Notch3 not affected by γ-secretase inhibition. Using an inducible LSL-KRAS(G12D) model of lung cancer in vivo, we show a transient upregulation of Notch pathway activity in early tumor precursor lesions. However, a more rigorous test of the requirement for Notch signaling in lung oncogenesis, crossing the LSL-KRAS(G12D) mouse model with a transgenic with a similarly inducible global dominant-negative suppressor of Notch activity, LSL-DNMAML (dominant-negative mastermind-like), reveals no evidence of Notch pathway requirement for lung tumor initiation or growth in vivo. Distinct Notch family members may have different and potentially opposing activities in oncogenesis, and targeted inhibition of individual Notch family members may be a more effective anticancer strategy than global pathway suppression.
