Prolonged administration of diphenylhydantoin (DPH) has been implicated as a possible etiologic factor in immunological aberrations and lymphoproliferative disorders. Diphenylhydantoin may account for the increase in susceptibility to lymphoproliferative diseases, as a result of its immunosuppressive effect. We report a case of amyloidosis with monoclonal gammopathy which developed during DPH treatment, without multiple myeloma or lymphoproliferative disorders. The association between DPH and monoclonal gammopathy is very rare, and such a case of amyloidosis associated with DPH has not been reported previously. DPH, however, may have played a role in the development of monoclonal gammopathy, which was the precursor of amyloid protein.
A 14-year-old girl is reported with recurrent, azithromycin-induced, acute interstitial nephritis. The second episode was more severe than the first; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy, renal function remained impaired. Although most cases of antibiotic induced acute interstitial nephritis are benign and self-limited, some patients are at risk for permanent renal injury.
Panic disorder (PD) symptomatology has been reported to be altered by hormonal events or treatments which affect estrogen levels. Coryell et al. [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 39 (1982) 701-703; Am. J. Psychiatry, 143 (1986) 508-510] have suggested that the increased cardiovascular risk associated with PD is significantly greater in males, alluding to a potential cardioprotective effect of female hormones in the context of panic attacks. In the present study, we were, therefore, interested in elucidating the role of estrogen in modulating the behavioural and cardiovascular responses induced by the panicogenic agent pentagastrin, a cholecystokinin-B (CCK(B)) receptor agonist.
A double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled design with randomization of the order of a 3-day pretreatment of ethinyl estradiol (EE) (50 microg/day) or placebo was used to assess the effect of a 30-microg i.v. bolus injection of pentagastrin on panic symptom intensity and on increases in heart rate (DeltaHR), systolic (DeltaSBP) and diastolic (DeltaDBP) blood pressure following each pretreatment. Subjects were 9 male healthy controls and 11 male PD patients.
EE pretreatment did not significantly reduce the pentagastrin-induced panic symptom scale (PSS) scores and had no effect on DeltaDBP or DeltaSBP. EE did, however, attenuate the pentagastrin-induced increase in HR in both PD patients and healthy controls.
Only male subjects were included in the present study; however, we are currently investigating the influence of female gonadal hormones on the panic response to pentagastrin in female PD patients and healthy controls.
Our results suggest that estrogens may display cardioprotective effects in the context of panic attacks.
Sleep-deprived individuals appear to have decreased psychological and physical capabilities. Studies have shown how major psychological aspects, such as alertness, complex mental performance, and memory, are strongly affected by sleep deprivation. Military use of psychostimulants dates back many years, especially in units that operate over long hours and deprive soldiers of sleep. During prolonged military operations, pilots are regularly kept awake for hours and days without fulfilling their biological sleep requirements. This consequently affects their natural circadian rhythm. This article deals with both the benefits and the side effects of two kinds of psychostimulants, namely, dextroamphetamine, which is more popular and is most widely used, and modafinil, which is a relatively newer type. There is growing evidence that modafinil has fewer side effects, in comparison with its predecessor dextroamphetamine, while still maintaining all of the latter's beneficial characteristics.
Inorganic arsenic is a human carcinogen that can target the liver, but its carcinogenic mechanisms are still unknown. Global DNA hypomethylation occurs during arsenic-induced malignant transformation in rodent liver cells. DNA hypomethylation can increase gene expression, particularly when occurring in the promoter region CpG sites, and may be a non-genotoxic mechanism of carcinogenesis. Thus, in the present study liver samples of male mice exposed to 0 (control) or 45 p.p.m. arsenic (as NaAsO(2)) in the drinking water for 48 weeks were analyzed for gene expression and DNA methylation. Chronic arsenic exposure caused hepatic steatosis, a lesion also linked to consumption of methyl-deficient diets. Microarray analysis of liver samples showed arsenic induced aberrant gene expression including steroid-related genes, cytokines, apoptosis-related genes and cell cycle-related genes. In particular, the expression of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), and cyclin D1 genes were markedly increased. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed arsenic-induced increases in hepatic ER-alpha and cyclin D1 transcription and translation products, respectively. Arsenic induced hepatic global DNA hypomethylation, as evidenced by 5-methylcytosine content of DNA and by the methyl acceptance assay. Arsenic also markedly reduced the methylation within the ER-alpha gene promoter region, as assessed by methylation-specific PCR, and this reduction was statistically significant in 8 of 13 CpG sites within the promoter region. Overall, in controls 28.3% of the ER-alpha promoter region CpG sites were methylated, but only 2.9% were methylated after chronic arsenic exposure. Thus, long-term exposure of mice to arsenic in the drinking water can induce aberrant gene expression, global DNA hypomethylation, and the hypomethylation of the ER-alpha gene promoter, all of which could potentially contribute to arsenic hepatocarcinogenesis.
Ten patients with neuroblastoma were treated with a standard pulsed administration schedule of cis-platinum and etoposide (VP16-213). Two patients are experiencing good partial responses lasting over 8 months. One other patient had a partial response. Toxicity was mild and limited to high frequency hearing loss, temporary increase in blood urea nitrogen, and myelosuppression. These data may be useful to compare with data from other more aggressive or different administration schedules of the drug combination.
Administration of mercuric chloride into susceptible rats and mice induces a systemic autoimmune disease, which is characterized by a T-cell-dependent polyclonal B-cell activation, an increase in serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 and IgE, production of antibodies of different specificities and development of renal IgG deposits. A peculiar feature of mercury-induced autoimmunity is that the polyclonal B-cell activation spontaneously disappears in spite of continuous injection of mercury. The exact mechanism(s) for autoregulation of mercury-induced autoimmunity is not well understood. In the present study, we analysed the regulation of mercury-induced immune/autoimmune responses in mice and tested whether spontaneous downregulation of these responses is owing to a general immunosuppression. Mercury-susceptible [SJL (H-2s)] and -resistant [DBA/2 (H-2d)] mice were injected with mercury for 4, 10, 15 and 17 weeks. Immune/autoimmune responses were monitored in these mice. Thereafter, mercury-injected mice for 17 weeks were further immunized with horse red blood cells (HRBC) to study whether the subsequent humoral immune response to a foreign antigen is suppressed. We found that except for IgG1 anti-nucleolar antibody production and renal IgG1 deposition, other characteristics of mercury-induced autoimmunity were downregulated in SJL (H-2s) mice after chronic treatment with mercury. However, these mice did not show any reduction in the number of splenic antibody-secreting cells and/or in serum titres of specific IgM, IgG1 and IgG2a anti-HRBC antibodies in response to HRBC as compared with na√Øve mice. Similarly, in mercury-resistant DBA/2 (H-2d) mice, chronic treatment with mercury did not either suppress specific antibody responses against HRBC. Our findings show that the autoregulation of mercury-induced immune/autoimmune responses observed after chronic treatment with mercury is not owing to a general immunosuppression.
The cell viability of human cancer cell lines treated with [5,10-bis(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-15,20-diphenyl]porphinatoiron(III) (cis-FeMPy(2)P(2)P) has been estimated. The cis-FeMPy(2)P(2)P is a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic in vitro that exhibited a significant toxicity in cancer cell lines. This toxicity is rather due to pro-oxidant properties of the iron-porphyrin in vivo. We have demonstrated that there was the relationship between the LD(50) values calculated from the viability of cancer cell lines treated with cis-FeMPy(2)P(2)P and the SOD activities of the cell lines. Furthermore, the inhibition of SOD by antisense S-oligonucleotide increased the cytotoxic effect of cis-FeMPy(2)P(2)P against cancer cells. These results suggest that SOD is a target enzyme for the cell death induced by cis-FeMPy(2)P(2)P as a new class of anticancer agents.
The effect of mangiferin, a naturally occurring xanthone glucoside on cyclophosphamide-induced immunotoxicity and its mode of action in the immune system were investigated. To induce immunotoxicity, adult male Wistar rats were injected weekly with cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally at 100 mg/kg bodyweight. Mangiferin was injected intraperitoneally at 10 and 20 mg/kg daily for 14 days. Levamisole (3 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 14 days), a known immunostimulant that acts in immunosuppressive conditions was used as a standard drug. The effect of mangiferin on the primary immune response to ovalbumin (200 microg/rat, s.c.) was assessed at weekly intervals by measuring the serum ovalbumin-specific IgM levels. The organ weights and cellularity of spleen, thymus and bone marrow, haematology, T and B cell-dependent mitogen stimulation of splenocytes were assessed for the cellular response. Oxidative changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages were measured at the end of the study. As well, the in vitro effect of mangiferin on cytotoxicity caused by H2O2 in primary lymphocytes was studied. The decrease in the lymphoid organ weights, cellular responses and antigen-specific IgM levels by cyclophosphamide treatment were significantly increased by repeated intraperitoneal administration of mangiferin. The enhanced lipid peroxidation and decreased catalase and superoxide dismutase activities found in lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and macrophages from cyclophosphamide treated rats were significantly ameliorated in mangiferin treated groups. The tissue injury caused by cyclophosphamide treatment was significantly suppressed by mangiferin as shown by the decrease in serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity. In vitro experiments showed that pretreatment of lymphocytes with mangiferin protected from the toxicity induced by H2O2, further confirming the in vivo findings. From this study, it is evident that mangiferin exhibits an immunoprotective role mediated through the inhibition of reactive intermediate-induced oxidative stress in lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages.
To study the effectiveness of single-dose norfloxacin and ofloxacin in the treatment of gonococcal urethritis in men, and to monitor in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to these antibiotics over time.
Centre M√©dico-Social de Bilyogo, Kigali, Rwanda. The only clinic in Rwanda using quinolones for the treatment of gonorrhoea.
As part of a monitoring programme, men with gonococcal urethritis were evaluated after treatment with norfloxacin (800 mg) in 1986 and 1987, and after treatment with ofloxacin (400 mg) in 1989.
Neisseria gonorrhoeae was eradicated from the urethra from 96.0% (189/197) and from 97.1% (166/171) men treated with norfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. Overall 38.2% of the pretreatment isolates produced penicillinase (PPNG isolates) and 20.4% (44/216) of the tested non-PPNG isolates were chromosomally resistant to penicillin (MIC > or = 2.0 mg/l). Resistance to tetracycline and thiamphenicol was common in both PPNG and non-PPNG and increased considerably in 1989. All isolates were susceptible to kanamycin, spectinomycin, ceftiaxone, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. However, a higher number of isolates recovered in 1989 showed decreased susceptibility to the quinolones. Treatment failure occurred more often in subjects with isolates having MIC values > or = 0.06 mg/L of norfloxacin (p = 0.006). Seven out of 13 patients who did not respond to therapy had no signs nor symptoms of urethritis.
Quinolone antibiotics are now indicated as a first line treatment of gonorrhoea in countries with a problem of antimicrobial multiresistance. However, antimicrobial susceptibility to the quinolones may decrease rapidly, and close monitoring of the in vitro susceptibility of N gonorrhoeae and the clinical effectiveness of the antibiotics is imperative.
This study examined the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure, environmental risk, and maternal verbal intelligence on children's cognitive ability. Gender and age were examined as moderators of potential cocaine exposure effects. The Stanford-Binet IV intelligence test was administered to 231 children (91 cocaine exposed, 140 unexposed) at ages 4, 6, and 9 years. Neonatal medical risk and other prenatal exposures (alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana) were also examined for their unique effects on child IQ. Mixed models analysis indicated that prenatal cocaine exposure interacted with gender, as cocaine-exposed boys had lower composite IQ scores. Age at assessment did not moderate this relation, indicating that cocaine-exposed boys had lower IQs across this age period. A stimulating home environment and high maternal verbal IQ also predicted higher composite IQ scores. Cocaine-exposed boys had lower scores on the Abstract/Visual Reasoning subscale, with trends for lower scores on the Short-Term Memory and Verbal Reasoning subscales, as exposure effects were observed across domains. The findings indicate that cocaine exposure continues to place children at risk for mild cognitive deficits into preadolescence. Possible mechanisms for the Exposure x Gender interaction are discussed.
Depressive symptoms in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) may improve under successful ED treatment. Self-reported depressive symptoms were compared in men with ED after sildenafil treatment to a group of untreated patients.
In an open study, self-reported depressive symptoms of 54 men after successful treatment with sildenafil (>4 weeks) and 51 men awaiting ED treatment were investigated with the Center of Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). CES-D items were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis and group differences in CES-D items and factors were analyzed.
Groups were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics and illness duration. CES-D total scores were lower in the group treated with sildenafil. Substantial differences were found in favor of the group treated with sildenafil, particularly in scores on a "positive affect" factor.
The findings emphasize the relevance of depression associated with ED and the importance of effective ED treatment. Although depression was generally low in this sample, hedonistic aspects were substantially enhanced in the group of ED patients after sildenafil treatment.
The open and cross-sectional study design does not permit causal inference. Selection bias and motivational aspects to participate in the study can not completely be ruled out.
Although the liver and pulmonary toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been extensively characterized, limited data concerning the nephrotoxic potential of these chemicals are available. The present studies were conducted to define the kidney cell-specific toxic responses to anthracene (ANTH), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and chrysene (CHRY). Given that exposure to environmental chemicals from a specific source is rarely limited to a single compound, a second goal was to evaluate the nephrotoxic potential of binary and ternary mixtures of these chemicals. Cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (rGMCs) and porcine cortico-tubular epithelial kidney cells (LLCPK-1) were challenged with hydrocarbon concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 30 microM for up to 24 h and were processed for measurements of mitochondrial membrane permeability, trypan blue dye exclusion, cytoplasmic enzyme leakage, and protein synthesis. BaP induced a threefold increase in mitochondrial fragility, a modest increase in cellular death, and 40% decrease in the rate of protein synthesis in rGMCs. Anthracene was also cytotoxic to rGMCs, inducing a twofold increase in mitochondrial fragility and a 40% decrease in the rate of protein synthesis, but no changes in cellular viability. Although CHRY was devoid of toxicity to rGMCs, a 40% decrease in the rate of protein synthesis was observed in LLCPK-1 cells treated with this hydrocarbon. BaP and ANTH were not overtly cytotoxic to LLCPK-1 cells at any of the concentrations tested. Binary and ternary mixtures of BaP with ANTH and CHRY in rGMCs, and mixtures of CHRY with ANTH and BaP in LLCPK-1 cells, yielded antagonistic interactions. Based on these data, it is concluded that PAHs exhibit chemical- and cell-specific nephrotoxicity, but that toxicological outcomes are influenced by the presence of multiple hydrocarbons in complex mixtures.
The 2'3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), a nonazylated dideoxynucleoside analog used for the treatment of AIDS, causes a dose-dependent, painful, sensorimotor axonal peripheral neuropathy in up to 30% of the patients. To investigate the cause of the neuropathy, we performed morphological and molecular studies on nerve biopsy specimens from well-selected patients with ddC-neuropathy and from control subjects with disease, including patients with AIDS-related neuropathy never treated with ddC. Because ddC, in vitro, inhibits the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we counted the number of normal and abnormal mitochondria in a 0.04 mm(2) cross-sectional area of the nerves and quantified the copy numbers of mtDNA by competitive PCR in all specimens. A varying degree of axonal degeneration was present in all nerves. Abnormal mitochondria with enlarged size, excessive vacuolization, electron-dense concentric inclusions and degenerative myelin structures were prominent in the ddC-neuropathy and accounted for 55% +/- 2.5% of all counted mitochondria in the axon and Schwann cells, compared with 9% +/- 0.7% of the controls (p < 0.001). Significantly (p < 0.005) reduced copy numbers, with as high as 80% depletion, of the mtDNA was demonstrated in the nerves of the ddC-treated patients compared with the controls. We conclude that ddC induces a mitochondrial neuropathy with depletion of the nerve's mtDNA. The findings are consistent with the ability of ddC to selectively inhibit the gamma-DNA polymerase in neuronal cell lines. Toxicity to mitochondria of the peripheral nerve is a new cause of acquired neuropathy induced by exogenous toxins and may be the cause of neuropathy associated with the other neurotoxic antiretroviral drugs or toxic-metabolic conditions.
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is implicated in cardiomyopathy (CM) and in elevated plasma lactate (LA) in AIDS through mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction. To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice (NL4-3Delta gag/pol; TG) and wild-type FVB/n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days. At termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of CM (ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] and sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase [SERCA2]), and determination of plasma LA. Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort, left ventricular mass increased 160% by echocardiography. Molecularly, ANF mRNA increased 250% and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57%. Biochemically, LA was elevated (8.5 +/- 2.0 mM). Pathologically, granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes, indicating enlarged, damaged mitochondria. Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally. No changes were found in other cohorts. After 10 days, only ANF was elevated, and only in the TG + HAART cohort. Results show that cumulative HAART caused mitochondrial CM with elevated LA in AIDS transgenic mice.
Acute angioneurotic edema due to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors usually develops shortly after therapy has been started. In this case, hypopharyngeal edema occurred with a delay of nine days. It required endotracheal intubation and could only be differentiated from an inflammatory process by examination under general anesthesia. The mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors, the pathogenesis of angioneurotic edema, its therapy outside as well as in the hospital, and the case described are being discussed. It is concluded that severe reactions induced by ACE inhibitors must be expected even after considerable time of therapy.
Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is a challenging management problem, since patients treated with amiodarone invariably have underlying heart disease. Consequently, thyrotoxicosis can significantly contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and hormone profiles of patients with AIT (n = 60) with those with Graves' thyrotoxicosis (n = 49) and toxic multinodular goitre (MNG, n = 40).
A retrospective study of patients with AIT in a single institution was conducted.
Data from patients with AIT over 12 years were collected.
Mean TSH levels were significantly suppressed in all three groups. However, there was no intergroup significant difference. Free thyroxine (T4) levels were significantly higher in AIT (45.6 +/- 3.5 pmol/l) and Graves' disease (44.6 +/- 4.0 pmol/l) compared with toxic MNG (31.5 +/- 5.1 pmol/l, P < 0.05). In contrast, free triiodothyronine (T3) levels were only significantly higher in Graves' disease (14.7 +/- 1.5 pmol/l, P = 0.002) compared with AIT (8.6 +/- 0.7 pmol/l) and toxic MNG (7.4 +/- 0.5 pmol/l). Six deaths occurred in the patients with AIT (10.0%, P < 0.01) and no deaths occurred in the other groups. Amiodarone treatment (P = 0.002) was the most significant predictor of death, whereas free T4, free T3 and age did not affect outcome. Within the amiodarone-treated group severe left ventricular dysfunction (P = 0.0001) was significantly associated with death.
(i) AIT differs from other forms of thyrotoxicosis, and (ii) severe left ventricular dysfunction is associated with increased mortality in AIT.
Fifteen patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract were treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy. Eleven patients were treated to metastatic lesions after surgical resection of primary cancers. One out of 15 patients died of chemotherapy. Of the remaining 14 patients, CR was achieved in one and PR was achieved in seven, clinically. The response rate was 57.1% and the median response duration was 12.6 months. In the patients who had been resected their primary lesions, the response rate was 70% and the duration was 14.1 months. Six patients, including five PRs and one NC, underwent surgical resection and re-staging of the residual tumors after chemotherapy. Clinical response coincided with pathological one in all 6 cases. Three patients were observed the decrease of the lung metastasis, which rate was more than 90%. Two out of 3 who did not show any invasion into the lymph channels in the resected residual tumors, have been free of a recurrence through-out the course of at 47 or at 42 months. However, another patient with lymph channel invasion died of metastasis of the mediastinal and paraaortic lymph nodes. Regarding the frequency of side effects, it seemed to be no significant difference between full and 80% doses administration. In the effectual cases, the residual tumors should be resected surgically and re-staged pathologically.
Tear production, evaluated every 2 hours from 8 AM to 8 PM by use of the Schirmer tear test over a 3-day period, was not significantly different between left and right eyes in 12 dogs. However, a significant diurnal pattern was evident. Tear production was lowest at midday and highest in the late afternoon/early evening. After pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution (0.25, 1.0, or 2.0%; 1 drop) was administered topically to the left eye of each dog at 7 AM on days 4, 6, and 8, respectively, tear production was determined for both eyes every 2 hours from 8 AM to 8 PM on the day of treatment. Analysis of tear values between eyes and between each eye's treatment and pretreatment values did not reveal significant change for the treated eye, but tear production was significantly less in the untreated eye, compared with its pretreatment values and with values in the treated eye. On day 10 (48 hours after the last treatment), tear production values were not significantly different between left and right eyes, and for both eyes, were not significantly different from the mean pretreatment tear production values. Topical application of 0.25, 1.0, or 2.0% pilocarpine HCl consistently caused blepharospasm, conjunctival hyperemia, and miosis of the treated eye, without significant increase in tear production. We concluded that topical application of pilocarpine, at the concentrations used, may have little value in treating disorders involving reduced tear production.
