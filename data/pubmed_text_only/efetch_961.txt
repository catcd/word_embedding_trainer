The aim of the present study was to assess the role of de novo protein synthesis in the acquisition and extinction of cocaine self-administration. In a first experiment, rats were trained to respond for intravenous cocaine infusions (0.3 mg/kg) and a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX; 3 mg/kg, s.c.) was injected immediately after each self-administration session. In a second experiment, rats were allowed to acquire cocaine self-administration and CHX was injected immediately after subsequent extinction sessions. CHX impaired the acquisition, but not extinction, of cocaine self-administration. In control experiments, CHX (3 mg/kg) blocked c-Fos protein expression after foot-shock stress and impaired the acquisition of conditioned freezing but did not inhibit spontaneous locomotor activity and sucrose drinking. Our results suggest that: i) the acquisition and extinction of cocaine-reinforced behaviour have a different molecular basis; and ii) only the former process requires de novo protein synthesis.
A new method is described for the assessment of the early cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin and related drugs on rat electrocardiographic parameters. Evidence is presented that during repeated treatment with adriamycin, no changes occur concerning the PR and RR intervals, QTc, or R- and S-wave voltages, whereas significant changes in the QRS complex, R alpha T and alpha TP intervals, and T-wave voltage are detectable. However, the earliest and most consistent electrocardiogram alteration observed during adriamycin treatment is a progressive, irreversible widening of the S alpha T segment. The S alpha T enlargement becomes significant during the first week of treatment and may be detected in all the tracings at all the times examined. The electrocardiogram changes are accompanied by cardiac histological lesions that gradually increase in severity during the study. These results indicate that the measurement of the S alpha T segment provides a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for the evaluation of electrocardiogram toxicity induced by adriamycin and related anthracyclines in the rat.
N-butyldeoxynojyrimicin (NB-DNJ, miglustat [Zavesca]) an approved drug for treating Gaucher disease, was reported to be able to correct the defective trafficking of the F508del-CFTR protein.
To evaluate the efficacy of in vivo airway delivery of miglustat for restoring ion transport in cystic fibrosis (CF).
We used nasal transepithelial potential difference (PD) as a measure of sodium and chloride transport. The effect of nasal instillation of a single dose of miglustat was investigated in F508del, cftr knockout and normal homozygous mice. The galactose iminosugar analog N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) was used as a placebo.
In F508del mice, sodium conductance (evaluated by basal hyperpolarization) and chloride conductance (evaluated by perfusing the nasal mucosa with chloride-free solution in the presence of amiloride and forskolin) were normalized 1 hour after an intranasal dose of 50 picomoles of miglustat. Chloride conductance in the presence of 200 microM 4-4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS), an inhibitor of alternative chloride channels, was much higher after miglustat than after placebo. In cftr knockout mice, a normalizing effect was observed on sodium but not on chloride conductance.
Our results provide clear evidence that nasal delivery of miglustat, at picomolar doses, normalizes sodium and Cftr-dependent chloride transport in F508del transgenic mice; they highlight the potential of topical miglustat as a therapy for CF.
Cocaine-responsive gene expression changes have been described after either no drug abstinence or short periods of abstinence. Little data exist on the persistence of these changes after long-term abstinence. Previously, we reported that after discrete-trial cocaine self-administration and 10 days of forced abstinence, incubation of cocaine reinforcement was observable by a progressive ratio schedule. The present study used rat discrete-trial cocaine self-administration and long-term forced abstinence to examine extinction responding, mRNA abundance of known cocaine-responsive genes, and chromatin remodeling. At 30 and 100 days of abstinence, extinction responding increased compared to 3-day abstinent rats. Decreases in both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens c-fos, Nr4a1, Arc, and EGR1 mRNA were observed, and in most cases persisted, for 100 days of abstinence. The signaling peptides CART and neuropeptide Y (NPY) transiently increased in the mPFC, but returned to baseline levels following 10 days of abstinence. To investigate a potential regulatory mechanism for these persistent mRNA changes, levels of histone H3 acetylation at promoters for genes with altered mRNA expression were examined. In the mPFC, histone H3 acetylation decreased after 1 and 10 days of abstinence at the promoter for EGR1. H3 acetylation increased for NPY after 1 day of abstinence and returned to control levels by 10 days of abstinence. Behaviorally, these results demonstrate incubation after discrete-trial cocaine self-administration and prolonged forced abstinence. This incubation is accompanied by changes in gene expression that persist long after cessation of drug administration and may be regulated by chromatin remodeling.
To compare the pharmacokinetics of two dosing regimens of cisapride and their effects on QT(c) interval.
Thirty-one pre-term infants were enrolled in two neonatal intensive care units. In 16 infants, cisapride was started at 0.2 mg/kg orally every 6 h (group A) and in 15 infants at 0.1 mg/kg orally every 3 h (group B). Electrocardiograms were performed before and after 72 h of treatment to calculate the QT(c) interval according to the Bazett formula. After 72 h of treatment, cisapride and norcisapride trough concentrations, and concentrations 1 h after the next cisapride administration were quantified in serum. A linear regression analysis was performed to analyse the effect of postnatal and postconception age.
At the start of cisapride treatment, mean postnatal age was 22.9+/-13.9 days (mean+/-SD) for group A and 23.3+/-15.0 days for group B, and mean postconception age was 34.0+/-1.8 weeks for group A and 33.3+/-0.8 weeks for group B. The QT(c) interval increased equally in both groups (group A: +37+/-20 ms, and group B: + 38+/-25 ms; P=0.9). Mean concentration of cisapride 1 h after administration was, as expected from the dosing regimen, significantly higher in group A than in group B (123.7+/-43.2 ng/ml versus 86.7+/-27.8 ng/ml; P=0.03).The difference in trough concentration was not significant (107.4+/-44.3 ng/ml versus 78.2+/-35.4 ng/ml; P=0.09). There was a positive correlation between QT(c) prolongation and cisapride serum concentration (peak: R(2)=0.20, P=0.015; trough: R(2)=0.24, P=0.008) and an inverse correlation between postnatal age and concentration 1 h after administration concentration of cisapride (R(2)=0.19, P=0.02). No correlation was found for postconception age.
Postnatal age has an inverse relationship with cisapride serum concentration in premature infants, whereas postconception age is not correlated. The maturation process of the biotransformation system of cisapride during the first weeks of life, triggered by birth, but independent of gestational age at birth can explain this observation. The effect of cisapride on cardiac repolarisation is positively related with the cisapride serum concentration. Administering cisapride every 3 h instead of every 6 h could be advantageous, as it is associated with lower peak cisapride serum concentrations. Further investigations are required to confirm this and its potential clinical benefit on QT(c )and arrhythmia risk.
A girl, born in 1975, developed severe aplastic anemia in November 1982 while on ethosuximide monotherapy for petit mal epilepsy, about 3 months after starting the ethosuximide medication. She was treated with bolus-methylprednisolone as described by Bacigalupo et al. (13), transfusions and antibiotics. During the third week on this regimen slight improvements in granulocyte and reticulocyte counts were demonstrated, and after approximately 6 weeks she was in stable condition without further need of transfusions. Blood status should be checked regularly during ethosuximide therapy, particularly during the first 6 months.
We had previously reported that aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) are overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), an AhR agonist, increased FGF-9 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Similarly, several AhR agonists increased FGF-9 mRNA levels, and BaP-induced FGF-9 expression was prevented by cotreatment with AhR antagonist in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, AhR agonists increased transcriptional activity of FGF-9 promoter. Modulation of AhR expression via RNA interference or transient overexpression respectively reduced or increased both constitutive and BaP-induced FGF-9 expression in human lung cells. These results suggested that AhR activation and overexpression increased FGF-9 expression in lung cells. FGF-9 increased growth of lung fibroblasts but not that of lung adenocarcinoma cells. However, conditioned media collected from FGF-9-treated fibroblasts increased cell growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, lung adenocarcinoma cells expressed FGF receptor 2 and cotreatment with anti-FGF receptor 2 prevented the interaction between fibroblasts and tumor cells. It is likely that FGF-9-stimulated fibroblasts secreted unknown factors, which activated FGF receptor 2 and subsequently promoted growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells. We further compared AhR and FGF-9 expression in 146 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases by immunohistochemistry. FGF-9 expression was more common in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas. Furthermore, FGF-9 and AhR expression were well correlated in lung adenocarcinomas. These results suggest that AhR expression correlated positively with FGF-9 expression in lung adenocarcinomas, which might promote tumor growth by modulating communication between tumor cells and fibroblasts. Preventing AhR overexpression or disturbing FGF-9 function may reduce the development of lung adenocarcinomas. (c) 2009 UICC.
Interindividual variability in dosage requirements of the calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressive agents cyclosporine and tacrolimus after liver transplantation may result from differences in the CYP3A activity of the liver graft. Early postoperative erythromycin breath test (ERMBT) is an in vivo measure of graft CYP3A activity. This study evaluates the usefulness of an early postoperative ERMBT in predicting early morbidity in liver transplant recipients.
In 26 liver transplant recipients, ERMBT was performed within 2 hr after transplantation. Main end points were the occurrence of cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity, episodes of early graft rejection, early graft function, and graft survival.
Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity were associated with low postoperative ERMBT values (mean 0.63%+/-0.25% 14C/hr vs. 1.35%+/-0.84% 14C/hr, P=0.02). No significant association between early graft rejection and ERMBT values was demonstrated. There was a significant inverse correlation between postoperative ERMBT values and the time to normalization of international normalized ratio as a measure of early graft function (r=-0.78, P<0.001). Graft loss was associated with low postoperative ERMBT values (0.21%+/-0.15% 14C/hr vs. 1.09%+/-0.72% 14C/hr, P=0.002).
An early postoperative ERMBT may be useful in predicting the development of cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity, severe graft dysfunction, or even graft loss in liver transplant recipients when calcineurin inhibitors are administered according to protocols. Whether ERMBT results may be used to individualize dosage of calcineurin inhibitors needs to be explored.
It is known that lactoferrin is one of the functional proteins contained in mammalian milk and that it plays an important role in the immune system. In this study, we prepared multi-lamellar liposomal bovine lactoferrin composed of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and phytosterol for oral delivery, and examined any resulting anti-inflammatory effects. Oral pretreatment of liposomal lactoferrin exhibited more suppressive effects than did non-liposomal lactoferrin on CCl4-induced hepatic injury in rats as well as on lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production from mouse peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. Further investigation revealed that the liposomalization did not exert influence on the absorbability of lactoferrin to the venous blood or lymph following an intraduodenal administration in rats. Furthermore, there was no significant difference exhibited between the antigenicity of liposomal and non-liposomal lactoferrin, which was measured using the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction following oral sensitization to them in guinea pigs. These results suggest that liposomal lactoferrin might act more effectively than conventional lactoferrin in the intestinal site, which is regarded as an active site of orally administered lactoferrin, although the biological mechanism is not fully understood yet. Consequently we propose that liposomal lactoferrin could be a novel active constituent useful for preventive and therapeutic treatment of inflammatory diseases.
An on-line enzymatic assay of dialysis fluid has been used to monitor the extracellular glutamate concentration in the rat hippocampus. Perfusion with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing a glutamate uptake inhibitor (either dihydrokainate or 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid) produced a marked stable increase in glutamate concentration; 10 min perfusion with 100 mM K+ produced a transient increase. Sustained epileptiform EEG discharges were induced in the hippocampus by focal injection of bicuculline into the piriform cortex or by systemic injection of picrotoxin. Extracellular glutamate did not change significantly during seizure activity, either in the absence or in the presence of glutamate uptake inhibitors. It is concluded that seizure activity is not necessarily accompanied by an overall increase in extracellular glutamate concentration.
Until now there have been no good therapeutic options in children with biopsy-proven transplant nephropathy (TN) and loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) while receiving cyclosporine A (CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisolone (Pred). In 13 kidney transplanted children (mean age 13 yr, SD 4) with CsA/MMF/Pred immunosuppression, renal biopsy revealed significant TN. MMF was discontinued, CsA dose was reduced to 50% and Everolimus was started (1.6 mg/m(2)/day). Pred was stopped in 10 of 13 patients. The mean GFR was 55 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (SD 24) one yr before switch, 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (SD 16, p < 0.05) at the time of switch and 47 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (SD 18, p < 0.05) 12 months later. There were no severe side-effects or acute rejections. Lactate dehydrogenase, cholesterol, creatine kinase, and U-albumin/creatinine ratio did not increase significantly. After six months, the mean certican-C0 level was 4.0 microg/L (SD 1.5) and mean CsA-C0 level was 52 ng/mL (SD 23). The GFR of transplanted kidneys in children with TN improved by changing immunosuppression from CsA/MMF/Pred to everolimus and low-dose CsA.
The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been suggested to play an important role in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). An oral adsorbent, AST-120, removes uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate (IS) and delays the progression of CKD, but the effect on ROS production is unknown. The present study aimed to determine whether AST-120 reduces oxidative stress in uremic rat kidneys using markers of ROS production such as acrolein and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG).
Daily administration of AST-120 was started 6 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy and continued for 18 weeks. The changes in metabolic data, serum and urine IS levels, urinary excretion of markers of oxidative stress, and renal histological findings were investigated in uremic rats with or without AST-120 treatment.
In parallel with the increase in serum and urine IS, the serum creatinine, urinary protein and acrolein levels started to increase at 6 weeks, but urinary 8-OHdG remained unchanged and significantly increased at 18 weeks in uremic rats. AST-120 markedly and significantly attenuated increases in uremic toxins and oxidative stress levels as well as the histological changes in glomerular sclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and the tubular staining of 8-OHdG.
AST-120 suppressed the progression of CKD, at least in part, via attenuation of oxidative stress induced by uremic toxin.
The results of the studies showed that the gonadotoxicity and embryotoxicity were found in rodents exposed to concentration of DCE at 24.8 mg/m3; DCE could reach the fetus through the placenta. The investigation of workers exposed to DCE indicated that prematurities among exposed female workers and wives of exposed male workers were higher than that of control groups. Therefore the MAC of DCE (25 mg/m3) is not safe enough.
High-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) causes hyperkalemia, thought to result from TMP-induced blockade of amiloride-sensitive Na(+)-channels in the distal nephron. The present study was performed in anesthetized dogs to determine if increasing distal sodium delivery affects this antikaliuretic effect. In Group 1, intrarenal infusion of vehicle did not alter renal function. In Group 2, i.v. infusion of amiloride led to diuresis, natriuresis and antikaliuresis associated with a reduction of the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) in both kidneys. Intrarenal infusion of TMP (0.2 mg/kg/min) into the left kidney did not further alter these parameters. In groups 3 and 4, intrarenal infusion of TMP caused an ipsilateral diuresis, natriuresis, antikaliuresis and a reduction in (TTKG) without affecting the contralateral kidney. The TMP infusion was followed by furosemide (20 mg i.v.) in group 3 and acute saline loading in group 4. Despite continuous TMP infusion, both furosemide and saline loading reversed the antikaliuretic effect of TMP in the ipsilateral kidney and was associated with a similar kaliuresis, diuresis, natriuresis and decrease in urine osmolality in both kidneys. The TTKG following furosemide or saline loading increased in the ipsilateral kidney and decreased in the contralateral kidney. In all groups the systemic and renal hemodynamics remained unchanged. These results suggest that acute administration of TMP inhibits the amiloride-sensitive Na(+)-channel and K+ secretion in the distal nephron. Maneuvers that increase distal Na+ delivery can abrogate TMP's antikaliuretic effect due, in part, to an increase of the low TTKG observed with TMP.
Venlafaxine is an antidepressant which acts through the inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Venlafaxine is active against neuropathic and chronic pain. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman who presented a paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. She presented paresthesias, pin pricks in both hands with functional impairment. Venlafaxine hydrochloride was introduced at 37.5 mg twice daily. The patient noticed a dramatic recovery of her symptoms within 2 days, with both reduction of the paresthesias and functional improvement. This is the first report of efficacious use of venlafaxine for the treatment of paclitaxel cumulative neurosensory toxicity.
In the present work, synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SRFTIR) micro-spectroscopy and imaging were used for topographic and semi-quantitative biochemical analysis of rat brain tissue in cases of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. The tissue samples were analyzed with a beam defined by small apertures and spatial resolution steps of 10 microm which allowed us to probe the selected cellular layers of hippocampal formation. Raster scanning of the samples has generated 2D chemical cartographies revealing the distribution of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Spectral analysis has shown changes in the saturation level of phospholipids and relative secondary structure of proteins. Special interest was put in the analysis of two areas of the hippocampal formation (sector 3 of the Ammon's horn, CA3 and dentate gyrus, DG) in which elemental abnormalities were observed during our previous studies. Statistically significant increase in the saturation level of phospholipids (increased ratio of the absorption intensities at around 2921 and 2958 cm(-1)) as well as conformational changes of proteins (beta-type structure discrepancies as shown by the increased ratio of the absorbance intensities at around 1631 and 1657 cm(-1) as well as the ratio of the absorbance at 1548 and 1657 cm(-1)) were detected in pyramidal cells of CA3 area as well as in the multiform and molecular layers of DG. The findings presented here suggest that abnormalities in the protein secondary structure and increases in the level of phospholipid saturation could be involved in mechanisms of neurodegenerative changes following the oxidative stress evoked in brain areas affected by pilocarpine-induced seizures.
Mangiferin, a natural polyphenol, has been shown to have hypolipidemic effect in rat and mouse. However, the mechanism of action is not well understood. This study was conducted to determine the effect and mechanism of action of mangiferin on hyperlipidemia induced in hamsters by a high-fat diet.
Forty male hamsters were randomly assigned to normal control, high-fat control, and high fat with mangiferin (50 and 150 mg/kg BW) groups. Mangiferin treatment significantly decreased final body weight, liver weight and visceral fat-pad weight, serum triglyceride (TG) and total free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations, hepatic TG levels and hepatic and muscle total FFA contents. Mangiferin upregulated mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), fatty acid translocase (CD36) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), but downregulated mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT-2) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in liver. Mangiferin also stimulated mRNA expression of PPAR-α, CD36, CPT-1 and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in muscle.
The results suggest that mangiferin may ameliorate hypertriglyceridemia partly by modulating the expression levels of genes involved in lipid oxidation and lipogenesis.
Aristolochic acid (AA) causes aristolochic acid nephropathy, Balkan endemic nephropathy, and their urothelial malignancies. To identify enzymes involved in the metabolism of aristolochic acid I (AAI), the major toxic component of AA we used HRN (hepatic cytochrome P450 [Cyp] reductase null) mice, in which NADPH:Cyp oxidoreductase (Por) is deleted in hepatocytes. AAI was demethylated by hepatic Cyps in vitro to 8-hydroxy-aristolochic acid I (AAIa), indicating that less AAI is distributed to extrahepatic organs in wild-type (WT) mice. Indeed, AAI-DNA-adduct levels were significantly higher in organs of HRN mice, having low hepatic AAI demethylation capacity, than in WT mice. Absence of AAI demethylation in HRN mouse liver was confirmed in vitro; hepatic microsomes from WT, but not from HRN mice, oxidized AAI to AAIa. To define the role of hepatic Cyps in AAI demethylation, modulation of AAIa formation by CYP inducers was investigated. We conclude that AAI demethylation is attributable mainly to Cyp1a1/2. The higher AAI-DNA adduct levels in HRN than WT mice were the result of the lack of hepatic AAI demethylation concomitant with a higher activity of cytosolic NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (Nqo1), which activates AAI. Mouse hepatic Cyp1a1/2 also activated AAI to DNA adducts under hypoxic conditions in vitro, but in renal microsomes, Por and Cyp3a are more important than Cyp1a for AAI-DNA adduct formation. We propose that AAI activation and detoxication in mice are dictated mainly by AAI binding affinity to Cyp1a1/2 or Nqo1, by their turnover, and by the balance between oxidation and reduction of AAI by Cyp1a.
A course of the adaptogen extractum Rhodiola rosea (3.5 ml/kg given per os daily for 8 days). produces am antiarrhythmic effect on models of epinephrine-induced arrhythmia. Blockade of mu-opiate receptors (OR) by naloxone (0.2 mg/kg) and delta-OR by ICI 174.864 (2.5 mg/kg) had no effect on the resistance of the heart of rats adapted to epinephrine. Higher doses of naloxone reduced significantly the antiarrhythmic effect of extr. Rhodiola. The antiarrhythmic effect of the extract is assumed to be related to activation of the opioid system and stimulation of kappa-OR.
The cardiovascular effects of the opioid mixed agonist-antagonist, meptazinol, and the opioid antagonist, naloxone, have been evaluated in conscious rats, anaesthetized rats and anaesthetized cats following the induction of haemorrhagic shock. The mean arterial pressure of conscious rats decreased by 17-29 mmHg following a haemorrhage of 20% of blood volume. Meptazinol (17 mg kg-1, i.m.) administered after haemorrhage evoked a rapid and sustained increase in mean arterial pressure to pre-haemorrhage levels. Naloxone (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) also increased mean arterial pressure to a level significantly higher than post-haemorrhage values. Neither haemorrhage nor subsequent drug treatments evoked significant changes in the heart rates of conscious rats. In anaesthetized rats, 20% haemorrhage evoked decreases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. Blood flow to the heart, skin, skeletal muscle, kidneys, spleen and liver (arterial) was decreased. Meptazinol and naloxone increased blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, but did not significantly alter heart rate or cardiac output. Hepatic arterial flow decreased further in both drug and vehicle treated groups. In addition meptazinol slightly reduced skeletal muscle flow. In anaesthetized cats 40% haemorrhage decreased mean arterial pressure by 46 +/- 3 mmHg. An intravenous infusion of either meptazinol or naloxone (cumulative 2 mg kg-1, i.v.) partially restored blood pressure. In experimental animal models of haemorrhagic shock, meptazinol has a similar cardiovascular profile to naloxone. The established analgesic activity of meptazinol may confer an advantage in some shock states.
A single 30 mg intravenous dose of labetalol given 20 minutes prior to cesarean delivery at 35 weeks of gestation for severe pregnancy-induced hypertension was associated with symptoms of beta-adrenergic blockade (hypoglycemia, bradycardia, hypotension) in preterm twins. The infants were subsequently found to have therapeutic labetalol concentrations (180 and 150 ng/mL) in umbilical cord blood. The pharmacology of transplacental labetalol is reviewed and potential mechanisms for neonatal beta-adrenergic blockade are discussed.
To observe the apoptosis and oncosis of pancreatic acinar cells and secondary inflammatory reaction in pancreatic tissue from rats with acute pancreatitis (AP), and the influences of artemisinin on them.
AP was induced by 4 intraperitoneal injections of caerulein at 1 h intervals. To induce apoptosis, solution of artemisinin (50 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally 1, 12, 24 and 36 h after the last caerulein injection. Histological examination of impairment of pancreatic tissue and detection of serum amylase were performed to evaluate the severity of acute pancreatitis. Apoptosis and oncosis were detected with acridine orange (AO) and ethylene dibromide (EB) staining. Caspase-3 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured by colorimetric assay. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was detected by flow cytometry. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) protein was measured by Western blot. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) mRNA was detected by RT-PCR.
Addition of artemisinin increased the number of apoptotic cells (11.7% +/- 1.4% vs 6.3% +/- 0.7%, P < 0.05), while reduced the number of oncotic cells (13.0% +/- 2.4% vs 17.5% +/- 2.2%, P < 0.05). The activity of caspase-3 speeded up (1.52 +/- 0.21 vs 1.03 +/- 0.08, P < 0.05), the pancreas pathological impairment was relieved (3.0 +/- 0.5 vs 4.0 +/- 0.5, P < 0.05) and the level of serum amylase decreased (5642 +/- 721 U/dL vs 7821 +/- 653 U/dL, P < 0.05). The activation of NF-kB (29% +/- 4.1% vs 42% +/- 5.8%), MIP-1alpha protein (3.7 +/- 0.5 vs 5.8 +/- 0.7), MPO (0.52 +/- 0.06 U/g vs 0.68 +/- 0.09 U/g), IL-1beta mRNA (1.7 +/- 0.3 vs 2.4 +/- 0.4) in the apoptosis inducing group was obviously decreased (P < 0.05).
Inducing apoptosis can relieve pathological impairment and inflammatory reaction in AP rats.
Inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE, neurotoxic esterase) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities was compared in brain and spinal cords of adult While Leghorn hens and adult male Long Evan rats 4-48 hr after administration of triortho-tolyl phosphate (TOTP po, 50-500 mg/kg to hens; 300-1000 mg/kg to rats), phenyl saligenin phosphate (PSP im 0.1-2.5 mg/kg to hens; 5-24 mg/kg to rats), mipafox (3-30 mg/kg ip to hens and rats), diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP sc, 0.25-1.0 mg/kg to hens; 1-3 mg/kg to rats), dichlorvos (5-60 mg/kg ip to hens; 600-2000 mg/kg to rats), and carbaryl (300-560 mg/kg ip to hens; 30-170 mg/kg to rats). Inhibitions of NTE and AChE were dose-related after administration of all compounds to both species. Hens and rats given TOTP, PSP, mipafox, and DFP demonstrated delayed neuropathy 3 weeks later, with spinal cord lesions and clinical signs more notable in hens. Ratios of NTE/AChE inhibition in hen spinal cord, averaged over the doses used, were 2.6 after TOTP, 5.2 after PSP, 1.3 after mipafox, and 0.9 after DFP, which contrast with 0.53 after dichlorvos, 1.0 after malathion, and 0.46 after carbaryl. Rat NTE/AChE inhibition ratios were 0.9 after TOTP, 2.6 after PSP, 1.0 after mipafox, 0.62 after DFP, 1.3 after dichlorvos, 2.2 after malathion, and 1.1 after carbaryl. The lower NTE/AChE ratios in rats given dosages of the four organophosphorus compounds that caused delayed neuropathy interferred with survival, an effect that was not a problem in hens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBA), 5-methylchyrsene (5MC), and cyclopenta[cd]pyrene (CPP) were examined for their lung tumorigenic activities in strain A/J mice, their ability to form PAH-DNA adducts in lung tissues, and their ability to mutate the Ki-ras oncogene in PAH-induced tumors. PAHs dissolved in tricapyrlin were administered by single intraperitoneal injection to male strain A/J mice (20 mice/dose) at doses up to 200 mg/kg depending on the PAH. Animals were sacrificed 8 months later and the lungs removed, fixed, and surface adenomas enumerated. DBA produced maximal tumor multiplicity at the highest dose, 10 mg/kg, giving 32.2 lung adenomas per mouse. At 100 mg/kg, B[a]P, B[b]F, 5MC, and CPP gave 12.8, 5.3, 93.1, and 32.2 lung adenomas per mouse, respectively. The dose response data for each PAH was fit to y = 0.6 + bx1.6, where y is the observed mean lung adenomas per mouse at dose x (in mg/kg), 0.6 is the observed background of lung adenomas per mouse, and b is the fitted constant representing the potency of each PAH. Statistical analysis indicated that the fit of the data to the equation was extremely high with adjusted R2 values > 0.985 and small fit standard errors. Based on this equation, the relative potencies of B[b]F, DBA, 5MC, and CPP compared to B[a]P were PAH (relative activity): DBA (118); 5MC (8.8); CPP (2.9); B[a]P (1.0); B[b]F (0.43). DNA adducts were measured by 32P-postlabeling techniques on DNA from lungs of mice treated with these PAHs. Adducts identified by cochromatography with standards were: from B[a]P, 7R,8S,9S-trihydroxy-10R-(N2-2'-deoxyguanosyl)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro- B[a]P, and two adducts resulting from the metabolic activation of 9-hydroxy-B[a]P and trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydro-B[a]P; from B[b]F, 5-hydroxy-B[b]F-9,10-diol-11,12-oxide-2'-deoxyguanosine; from DBA, three adducts from the metabolic activation of trans,trans-3,4,10,11-tetrahydroxy-3,4,10,11-tetrahydro-DBA and two anti-DBA-3,4-diol-1,2-oxide-N2-[2'-deoxyguanosine] adducts; from 5MC, 1R,2S,3S-trihydroxy-4-(N2-2'-deoxyguanosyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro- 5MC; from CPP, four CPP-3,4-oxide-2'-deoxyguanosine adducts. Ki-ras codon 12 mutation analysis of PAH-induced tumors was performed using PCR and dideoxy sequencing methods. Mutations from lung tumors from tricaprylin-treated mice were GGT-->GAT, GGT-->CGT, and GGT-->GTT. DBA produced no mutations in Ki-ras codon 12 above spontaneous levels. High proportions (> or = 50%) of GGT-->TGT mutations from B[a]P, B[b]F and 5MC induced tumors and GGT-->CGT mutations from CPP tumors were observed and were statistically significant compared to mutations in tricaprylin control tumors. We conclude from the DNA adduct and Ki-ras mutation studies that bay region diol-epoxide-2'-deoxyguanosine PAH-DNA adducts are associated with the GGT-->TGT mutations, and cyclopenta-ring oxide-2'-deoxyguanosine adducts associated with the GGT-->CGT mutations.
Exposure to environmental pollution is rarely limited to a single compound or even a single class of compounds. The Superfund site located in Massena, NY, is contaminated by both halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Since representatives of both HAHs and PAHs are capable of binding to the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), two well-documented AhR-mediated effects, immunosuppression and induction of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, were used to evaluate the individual and interactive toxicity of these compounds. Fifteen PAHs were first screened for their ability to suppress the antibody response in C57BL/6 (Ah+/+) mice immunized 12 h after a single oral dose of 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg. Acenaphthene, anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene had little or no effect. Seven PAHs caused > 50% suppression at 100 mg/kg. Listed in order of decreasing potency they were benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, indeno[1,2,3,c,d]pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, and benz[a]anthracene. Chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), were further evaluated to determine the dependence of these effects on the Ah phenotype by comparing responses of C57BL/6 and congenic B6.D2 (Ah-/-) mouse strains. Chrysene immunosuppression was maximal at 0.1 mg/kg and was Ah phenotype-independent whereas chrysene AHH induction was Ah phenotype-dependent, but a 100-fold less sensitive indicator of exposure. In contrast, B[a]P immunosuppression and AHH induction were coincident in B6 mice and Ah phenotype-dependent. In the final phase, a new approach was used to evaluate toxic interactions. This approach considers the mechanism of action of each compound and accounts for the fact that the extent of increase in toxic response caused by an incremental change of dose is determined by its position on the dose-response curve rather than on the absolute amount of dose administered. Thus, the immunotoxic effects of combined exposure to B[a]P and the AhR ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a representative HAH, were evaluated by combining the ED20 of B[a]P with the difference between the ED20 and ED40 of TCDD, and vice versa, to produce 40% suppression. The results of the combination were consistent with additivity regardless of the composite arrangement or phenotype although some antagonism could not be excluded with certainty.
The complement system is an essential element in our innate defense against infections with Neisseria meningitidis. We describe 2 cases of meningococcal septic shock, 1 of them fatal, in 2 children of a Turkish family. In the surviving patient, alternative pathway activation was absent and factor D plasma concentrations were undetectable. Concentrations of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), C1q, C4 and C3, factor B, properdin, factor H, and factor I were normal. Mutation analysis of the factor D gene revealed a T638 > G (Val213 > Gly) and a T640 > C (Cys214 > Arg) mutation in the genomic DNA from the patient, both in homozygous form. The consanguineous parents and an unaffected sister had these mutations in heterozygous form. In vitro incubation of factor-D-deficient plasma of the boy with serogroup B N meningitidis showed normal MBL-mediated complement activation but no formation of the alternative pathway C3-convertase C3bBbP, and severely decreased C3bc formation and terminal complement activation. The defect was restored after supplementation with factor D. In conclusion, this is the second report of a factor D gene mutation leading to factor D deficiency in a family with meningococcal disease. This deficiency abolishes alternative-pathway dependent complement activation by N meningitidis, and leads to an increased susceptibility to invasive meningococcal disease.
