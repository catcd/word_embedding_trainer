5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. On the basis of recent findings, low-dose Cisplatin (CDDP) and continuous venous infusion of 5-FU have shown additive or synergistic antitumor effects in experimental models. We evaluated clinical effects of low-dose CDDP and 5-FU (low-dose FP therapy) in patients with advanced gastric cancers.
In December 1993 and June 1998, 52 patients with advanced gastric cancer were entered in this study. Patients were considered eligible if they had a bidimensionally measurable tumor. 5-FU (160 mg/m2/day) was continuously infused over 24 hours using an implantable port, and CDDP (3 mg/m2/day) was infused for half an hour. The administration schedule consisted of 5-FU for 7 consecutive days and CDDP for 5 days followed by a 2-day rest every four weeks according to response and tolerance.
Low-dose FP therapy was given 44 patients (85%). The response rate was 65.9% and median survival time was 249 days. The responder group showed good survival compared with the non-responder group. The regimen was tolerable, and the most common toxicity was anorexia (40.3%). Three patients suffered from grade 3 anorexia, leukopenia and mucositis. On the other hand, renal dysfunction occurred in 50% (two of four patients administered over 1,000 mg CDDP). These results raise the possibility that the dose-limiting factor of low-dose FP therapy may account for the total dosage of CDDP.
Low-dose FP therapy promises to be effective in the clinical management of advanced gastric cancer.
The effects of the combined use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazepril and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1RA) valsartan on apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Fas and FasL in the kidney of rats with adriamycin-induced nephritic glomerulosclerosis was investigated. Uninephrectomy and the injection of adriamycin induced the rat model of glomerulosclerosis. Benazepril (6 mg/kg), valsantan (20 mg/kg), or benazepril (3 mg/kg) plus valsantan (20 mg/kg) was respectively delivered daily by gavage to the rats in three treatment groups for 12 weeks. Apoptosis was examined by means of terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Immunohistochemistry was adopted to detect the expression of Fas and FasL. Software of pathological analysis quantitated the levels of Fas and FasL. The results showed that as compared with those in the control group, the kidneys in the model group had more severe glomerulosclerosis, much more apoptotic cells and higher levels of expression of Fas and FasL. The degree of glomerulosclerosis, the number of apoptotic cells and the levels of expression of Fas and FasL were reduced by benazepril and valsartan. The combined use of benazepril and valsartan had the best therapeutic effect. It was concluded that benazepril and valsartan could suppress the excessive apoptosis of kidney cells by lowering the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins Fas and FasL, so as to postpone the process of glomerulosclerosis. The combined use of benazepril and valsartan has better therapeutic effect.
Alcohol consumption is customary in many cultures and it is a common human behavior worldwide. Binge ethanol and chronic alcohol consumption, two usual drinking patterns of human beings, produce a state of oxidative stress in liver and disturb the liver function. However, a safe and effective therapy for alcoholic liver disease in humans is still elusive. This study identified the natural product berberine as a potential agent for treating or preventing ethanol-induced liver injury. We demonstrated that berberine attenuated oxidative stress resulted from binge drinking in liver by reducing hepatic lipid peroxidation, glutathione exhaust and mitochondrial oxidative damage. Furthermore, berberine also prevented the oxidative stress and macrosteatosis in response to chronic ethanol exposure in mice. Either the total cytochrome P450 2E1 or the mitochondria-located cytochrome P450 2E1, which is implicated in ethanol-mediated oxidative stress, was suppressed by berberine. On the other hand, berberine significantly blunted the lipid accumulation in liver due to chronic alcohol consumption, at least partially, through restoring peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma Co-activator-1α and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α/microsomal triglyceride transfer protein pathways. These findings suggested that berberine could serve as a potential agent for preventing or treating human alcoholic liver disease.
The effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris (control group). Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms/min up to 50 micrograms. In all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 +/- 13 micrograms (mean +/- SD). In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred. The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery. The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery. These results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.
Three patients with niacin-induced visual symptoms had cystoid maculopathy without leakage on fluorescein angiography, and a fourth patient with no fundus abnormality experienced cessation of visual symptoms upon discontinuation of niacin. All four patients had been taking high doses of niacin (3.0-4.5 g daily) before the onset of symptoms. An additional 15 asymptomatic patients who were receiving high doses of oral niacin (1.0-6.0 g daily) for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia were evaluated for evidence of subclinical macular disease. None of these patients had cystic or other significant macular changes. Niacin causes a reversible toxic cystoid maculopathy that occurs in approximately 0.67% of patients taking high doses of the drug. The authors conclude that among patients taking high doses of oral niacin only those who experience visual symptoms need to be ophthalmologically evaluated.
Prolonged administration of peroxisome proliferators to rodents typically leads to hepatocarcinogenesis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is required to mediate alterations in PPARalpha target gene expression, repress apoptosis, enhance replicative DNA synthesis, oxidative stress to DNA and hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the relatively specific PPARalpha agonist, Wy-14,643. Interestingly, administration of the less specific PPARalpha agonist, bezafibrate, leads to a modest induction of PPARalpha target genes in the absence of PPARalpha expression. In these studies, the role of PPARalpha in modulating hepatocarcinogenesis induced by long-term feeding of 0.5% bezafibrate was examined in wild-type (+/+) and PPARalpha-null (-/-) mice. The average liver weight was significantly higher in (+/+) and (-/-) mice fed bezafibrate than controls, but this effect was considerably less in (-/-) mice as compared with similarly treated (+/+) mice. Increased levels of mRNA encoding cell cycle regulatory proteins and DNA repair enzymes were found in (+/+) mice fed bezafibrate, and this effect was not found in (-/-) mice. In mice fed bezafibrate for 1 year, preneoplastic foci, adenomas and a hepatocellular carcinoma were found in (+/+) mice, while only a single microscopic adenoma was found in one (-/-) mouse. This effect was observed in both Sv/129 and C57BL/6N strains of mice, although only preneoplastic foci were observed in the latter strain. Interestingly, hepatic cholestasis was observed in 100% of the bezafibrate-fed (-/-) mice, and this was accompanied by significantly elevated hepatic expression of mRNA encoding bile salt export pump and lower expression of mRNA encoding cytochrome P450 7A1, consistent with enhanced activation of the bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor. Results from these studies demonstrate that the PPARalpha is required to mediate hepatocarcinogenesis induced by bezafibrate, and that PPARalpha protects against potential cholestasis.
Inositol-1-phosphate (Ins1P), an index of phosphoinositide (PI) turnover, was measured in frontal and piriform cortices, caudate, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum in saline or LiCl (5 m Eq./kg) pretreated rats 60 min. after graded doses of DFP, paraoxon, or soman. DFP only produced bursts of convulsive activity whereas both paraoxon and soman produced prolonged tonic-clonic convulsions. All three organophosphates (OP) produced convulsions at a lower dose in LiCl than in saline pretreated rats. Regional Ins1P correlated better with the presence or absence of convulsions than with the dose of paraoxon or soman. This was true both in saline and LiCl pretreated rats. In saline pretreated non-convulsing rats, there was a cholinergic increase (1.5-2.0 X) in Ins1P in all brain regions except cerebellum after OP injection. In saline pretreated convulsing rats, there was a marked seizurogenic further increase in Ins1P; highest in caudate (8 X) and cortex (6 X). In LiCl pretreated nonconvulsing rats, the OP-induced cholinergic increase in Ins1P was significant only in caudate, thalamus and hippocampus. In LiCl pretreated convulsing rats, the further seizurogenic increase in Ins1P was less than in saline pretreated rats except in thalamus and hippocampus. Thus, OP produce both a cholinergic and a seizurogenic increase in PI turnover. These data suggest that increased PI turnover in the hippocampus may indicate a lithium-induced lowering of the seizure threshold for OP in limbic regions.
1. Digoxin toxicity can result from overdose or iatrogenic causes, especially if renal function is impaired. 2. We present a case of digoxin toxicity presenting with severe bradycardia and hypotension in a 66 year old man with chronic renal failure. Regular haemodialysis had, as predicted, failed to reduce his plasma digoxin concentration. Digoxin specific antibody fragments (Fab) were not readily available and their use was probably inappropriate as they are normally renally eliminated. 3. The patient was successfully treated by two prolonged courses of intestinal dialysis with repeated doses of activated charcoal over 48 and 72 h and totaling 400 g and 600 g, respectively. However, the patient found the activated charcoal extremely unpalatable. 4. Multiple dose activated charcoal intestinal dialysis (MDACID) has been recently advocated for use in a wide range of poisonings. The technique takes advantage of the large surface area of the small intestine to eliminate drugs and metabolites, over several days if necessary. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin toxicity in chronic renal failure make intestinal dialysis an appropriate method of treatment but the realisation of the true potential of this technique awaits a more palatable absorbent or formulation.
Patients with hereditary neuropathies are more susceptible to vincristine (VIN)-induced neuropathy than patients without this comorbidity. The heterozygous P0(+/-) mouse is an animal model of a distinct form of inherited neuropathies. These mice produce only 50% of the major myelin protein protein zero (P0) and display signs of demyelination in motor nerves at 4 months of age. Here we investigated the development of neuropathic signs in P0(+/-) and wild-type (wt) mice after VIN treatment. Neuropathy was induced by daily intraperitoneal injections of VIN (0.5 mg/kg body weight) over 10 days. Behavioral and electrophysiological tests were performed at regular time points. Wt mice developed significant hypersensitivity to heat and mechanical stimuli between days 7 and 38 after the first VIN injection. Surprisingly, P0(+/-) mice did not show sensory or motor signs of neuropathy over the whole testing period. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an increase in macrophage numbers in sciatic nerve sections of wt mice after VIN, whereas P0(+/-) mice had higher baseline levels of macrophages without changes after VIN treatment. Semithin sections revealed a decrease in the number of small-diameter myelinated fibers in the sciatic nerves of wt mice after VIN application, whereas P0(+/-) mice had higher baseline values of this fiber subtype that did not change under treatment. Dorsal root ganglion neurons of both genotypes showed an up-regulation of voltage-gated sodium channel immunoreactivity after VIN application without differences between the genotypes. Thus, the P0(+/-) phenotype seems to be protected against VIN-induced neuropathy. The mechanism of this neuroprotection remains elusive.
Although oral contraceptives (OCs) are yet to be legalized in Japan, it is estimated that at least 500,000 women were on pills in 1975. Intrahepatic cholestasis has been associated with OC in the Western countries, but only a few cases have been reported in Japan. A case of pill-related intrahepatic cholestasis in a 25-year old housewife will be presented in terms of clinical/pathological findings, changes in plasma and bile acid levels, and the effect of phenobarbital on bile stagnation. The patient had been taking 1 pill (Anovlar)/day, 25 days a month, for 5 months, and had experienced exhaustion, nausea, and constipation after 3 months of use; body itch and jaundice symptoms after 4 months. Cholangiography showed neither enlargement of the bile duct nor obstruction of the bile duct outside the liver. The condition was diagnosed as pill-related intrahepatic cholestasis. Total bilirubin was considerably raised; serum transaminase was moderately raised. Electromicroscopy showed the enlargement of bile canaliculi, which had electron dense bile content. Hepatic cellular peroxisome significantly increased. Plasma bile acid level, which was slightly raised initially, came down to the normal range when total bilirubin was back to normal with daily administration of phenobarbital 2 mg/kg. Studies which included experiments with rats as well as clinical-pathological results mentioned above suggested that bile stagnation was caused by ethinyl estradiol. By lowering bile canaliculi Na-K ATPase activity, ethinyl estradiol decreased bile acid independent of bile flow. Phenobarbital was effective for cholestasis by increasing bile canaliculi Na-K ATPase activity.
In rats, cyclo-L-glycyl-L-2-allylproline (NNZ-2591), a diketopiperazine, is neuroprotective after ischemic brain injury and also improves motor function in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Given nootropic actions of diketopiperazines, we investigated the effects of and potential role for acetylcholine neurotransmission in NNZ-2591 on spatial memory after scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups: saline/water; saline/NNZ-2591; scopolamine/water and scopolamine/NNZ-2591. Morris Water Maze (MWM) tasks were used to determine spatial learning and memory. Thirty minutes prior to each of four daily acquisition trials, rats were intraperitoneally injected with either scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline. Either NNZ-2591 (30 mg/kg) or water was administered orally (gavages) 10 min after the injection. Immediately after completion of the day 4 acquisition trial a spatial probe trial was performed. The brains were then collected for immunohistochemical analysis. Scopolamine impaired spatial learning and memory compared to saline treated group, particularly in the day 1 acquisition trial. NNZ-2591 did not reverse this deficit, however it significantly improved memory retention by showing more time spent in the correct quadrant. NNZ-2591 also counteracted the scopolamine-induced up-regulation of choline-acetyltransferase positive neurons in the striatum and similarly counteracted the increased synaptophysin density in the hippocampus. Furthermore, a scopolamine-independent antagonistic effect on muscarinic M2 acetylcholine receptors was found after NNZ-2591 treatment, supporting its modulation of acetylcholine neurotransmission. The data suggest that NNZ-2591 prevents scopolamine-induced acute impairment in memory and modulation of acetylcholine neurotransmission may be the mode of action underlying the memory improvement.
1. Nitrofurantoin is an antimicrobial agent which produces pulmonary toxicity via the redox cycling of the nitro group and its radical anion. This futile cycling triggers a complex series of events known collectively as oxidative stress. 2. In the isolated perfused rat lung, nitrofurantoin induced a decrease in tissue levels of glutathione but not protein thiols by the end of the 180 min experiment. There was no decline in tissue levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (a marker of cell disruption). However, edema was extensive as monitored in real time by weight gain (2.71 +/- 0.56 g vs 0.63 +/- 0.53 g in control, P < 0.05, n = 4) and lung mechanical functioning. The edema was matched by an increase in lavage proteins (85 +/- 15 mg vs 16 +/- 9 mg in controls, P < 0.05, n = 4). Electron microscopic examination of tissue indicated that the endothelial cells were detached from the basement membrane which would account for the edema. 3. Co-infusion of penicillamine, N-acetylcysteine or N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine which can protect tissue from oxidative stress failed to mitigate NFT-induced edema. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase and a metal chelator, significantly decreased weight gain but did not prevent the loss of glutathione. These results suggested that allopurinol was not blocking metabolic activation of NFT by xanthine oxidase but scavenging metal cations which can initiate and/or propagate the oxidative stress cascade. 4. We concluded that, in the isolated perfused rat lung, the classic pathway of oxidative stress induced by NFT is interrupted at the stage of GSH loss. These experiments demonstrated that organ function was compromised more than the individual cells. They also suggested that allopurinol may prove beneficial in modulating NFT pulmonary toxicity.
A case of transient, severe sensorineural hearing loss with iopamidol following angiography is reported. The 26-year-old woman had previously been diagnosed with Arnold-Chiari malformation, and underwent vertebral angiography by a retrograde transfemoral catheterization. Immediately following the second injection of iopamidol she did not react on the nurse's call. An ABR revealed no response in either ear even when the click intensity was 105 dB. The patient was immediately treated with steroid and OHP. Fortunately, 24 h after the angiography she was able to communicate at a normal conversation level. Transient severe sensorineural hearing loss is thought to result from bilateral anoxia of the cochlea due to hypoplasia of the basilo-vertebral artery systems. Cochlea anoxia lasts 10-20 min after which the hearing loss is recovered.
To characterize the effect of hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase intrinsic genetic heterogeneity on the inhibitory activity of nucleoside and non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitors.
The sensitivity of genotype (GT) 1 HCV NS5B clinical isolates from treatment-naive patients to nucleoside and non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors was assessed. The genetic diversity at the population level, as well as that of their quasispecies, was correlated with the observed reduced sensitivity to inhibitors.
R1479 and NM107 (nucleoside analogues that have entered Phase 2 clinical trials as prodrugs R1626 and NM283, respectively) were similarly active across the tested clinical isolates. Resistance mutations to nucleoside analogues were not observed in any of the isolates. However, the activity of the non-nucleoside thumb II inhibitor NNI-1, palm I inhibitors NNI-2 and NNI-3, and palm II inhibitor HCV-796 was reduced across different isolates. This reduction in inhibitory activity for non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) was, in most cases, correlated with the existence of known NNI resistance mutations in the NS5B polymerase population of the clinical isolates, as detected by population sequencing. Resistance mutations to NNIs were also observed at a low frequency within the clinical isolates' viral quasispecies that allowed for their rapid selection upon drug selective pressure.
The higher frequency of known NNI resistance mutations or polymorphisms known to affect their antiviral potency when compared with the lack of detection of resistance mutations to the nucleoside analogues suggests a potential for primary reduced responsiveness as well as faster development of clinically significant resistance.
We examined the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in chronic (pathological) pain in humans by using the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine as a probe. Thirty patients with neuropathic pain in the trigeminal area were given an i.m. injection of ketamine 0.4 mg/kg combined with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg. Pethidine 1.0 mg/kg served as a control. Three different response patterns were observed. Ketamine caused a long-term (6-24 h) analgesic effect partly dissociated from the mental side effects in 8 of the 26 patients who completed the study; these patients also had a slight analgesic effect of pethidine. In nine patients, ketamine caused a short-lasting (<2 h) analgesic effect closely associated with the mental side effects, whereas pethidine caused little or no analgesia. The remaining nine patients did not experience any reduction of pain after either drug in spite of characteristic side effects. One week after the i.m. challenge the patients received either 4.0 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride or placebo capsules to be taken orally as a nightly dose for three consecutive nights. Five of the eight patients who had a long-term analgesic effect of the i.m. challenge reported decreased pain on days after ketamine. None of the others reported an analgesic effect. The phenomenon of long-term depression of pain in a subgroup of patients was thus confirmed when ketamine was given p.o. These findings indicate that NMDA receptors are involved in the perception and maintenance of pathological pain in some patients. In others, pain appears to be mediated by NMDA receptor-independent mechanisms. We suggest that NMDA receptor-independent transmission in central pain pathways may contribute to the reduced efficiency of analgesic drugs often seen in chronic pain states.
Curcumin has been shown to inhibit the growth of various types of cancer cells; however, at concentrations much above the clinically achievable levels in humans. The concentration of curcumin achieved in the plasma after oral administration in humans was estimated to be around 1.8 microM. Here, we report that treatment of BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells with a low and single exposure of 2.5 microM curcumin for 24 h causes significant arrest of cells in the G2/M phase and induces significant apoptosis. Immunoblot studies revealed increased phosphorylation of H2A.X at Ser-139 and Chk1 at Ser-280 and a decrease in DNA polymerase-beta level in curcumin-treated cells. Phosphorylation of H2A.X and Chk1 proteins are an indicator of DNA damage whereas DNA polymerase-beta plays a role in the repair of DNA strand breaks. Normal immortalised human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE-6) cells remained unaffected by curcumin treatment. In addition, we also observed a significant increase in the phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser-345, Cdc25C at Ser-216 and a subtle increase in ATM phosphorylation at Ser-1981. Concomitant decrease in the expressions of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 were seen in curcumin-treated cells. Further, curcumin treatment caused significant cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in BxPC-3 but not in HPDE-6 cells. Silencing ATM/Chk1 expression by transfecting BxPC-3 cells with ATM or Chk1-specific SiRNA blocked the phosphorylation of ATM, Chk1 and Cdc25C and protected the cells from curcumin-mediated G2/M arrest and apoptosis. This study reflects the critical role of ATM/Chk1 in curcumin-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.
Felbamate is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and complex partial seizures that are refractory to other medications. Its unique clinical profile is thought to be due to an interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, resulting in decreased excitatory amino acid neurotransmission. To further characterize the interaction between felbamate and NMDA receptors, recombinant receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes were used to investigate the subtype specificity and mechanism of action. Felbamate reduced NMDA- and glycine-induced currents most effectively at NMDA receptors composed of NR1 and NR2B subunits (IC50 = 0.93 mM), followed by NR1-2C (2.02 mM) and NR1-2A (8.56 mM) receptors. The NR1-2B-selective interaction was noncompetitive with respect to the coagonists NMDA and glycine and was not dependent on voltage. Felbamate enhanced the affinity of the NR1-2B receptor for the agonist NMDA by 3.5-fold, suggesting a similarity in mechanism to other noncompetitive antagonists such as ifenprodil. However, a point mutation at position 201 (E201R) of the epsilon2 (mouse NR2B) subunit that affects receptor sensitivity to ifenprodil, haloperidol, and protons reduced the affinity of NR1-epsilon2 receptors for felbamate by only 2-fold. Furthermore, pH had no effect on the affinity of NR1-2B receptors for felbamate. We suggest that felbamate interacts with a unique site on the NR2B subunit (or one formed by NR1 plus NR2B) that interacts allosterically with the NMDA/glutamate binding site. These results suggest that the unique clinical profile of felbamate is due in part to an interaction with the NR1-2B subtype of NMDA receptor.
Several growth factors have been found to play an important role in the recovery from acute renal failure (ARF). The effect of the continuous subcutaneous infusion of human recombinant insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 (125 micrograms daily by osmotic minipumps) in a rat model of mercuric chloride (HgCl2)-induced ARF was examined. HgCl2 (4 mg/kg) induced ARF with a mortality that was unaffected by IGF-1. However, IGF-1 significantly enhanced functional and histologic recovery in the survivors, as measured by serum creatinine and creatinine clearance and by histologic scoring. Solution hybridization RNAase protection assays showed that renal IGF-1 mRNA, IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mRNA, and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) mRNA were unaffected by exogenous IGF-1, but this treatment significantly increased renal IGF-1 in ARF rats compared with normal rats and ARF rats not receiving IGF-1. After ARF renal mRNA for IGF-1 was decreased, IGF-1R was unchanged and IGFBP-1 was increased. Similar changes occurred in IGF-1-infused ARF rats. Thus, (1) IGF-1 enhances recovery from nephrotoxic ARF both functionally and histologically; (2) in nephrotoxic ARF, there is (a) a reduction in IGF-1 mRNA expression that is not prevented by IGF-1 infusion, and (b) an increase in renal IGFBP-1 mRNA. This may allow a significant increase in renal IGF-1 levels in IGF-1-infused ARF rats, despite the decrease in renal IGF-1 mRNA. A local increase in renal IGFBP-1 and IGF-1 may explain the accelerated recovery from ATN in this model. It was concluded that HgCl2-induced ARF is amenable to improvement by IGF-1 infusion and that the increase in renal IGFBP-1 mRNA may be an important modulator in the recovery of the kidney.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ganciclovir therapy in neonates with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease.
Neonates with symptomatic CMV disease involving the central nervous system were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir versus no treatment. The primary end point was improved brainstem-evoked response (BSER) between baseline and 6-month follow-up (or, for patients with normal baseline hearing, normal BSER at both time points).
From 1991 to 1999, 100 patients were enrolled. Of these, 42 patients had both a baseline and 6-month follow-up BSER audiometric examination and thus were evaluable for the primary end point. Twenty-one (84%) of 25 ganciclovir recipients had improved hearing or maintained normal hearing between baseline and 6 months versus 10 (59%) of 17 control patients (P=.06). None (0%) of 25 ganciclovir recipients had worsening in hearing between baseline and 6 months versus 7 (41%) of 17 control patients (P<.01). A total of 43 patients had a BSER at both baseline and at 1 year or beyond. Five (21%) of 24 ganciclovir recipients had worsening of hearing between baseline and > or =1 year versus 13 (68%) of 19 control patients (P<.01). A total of 89 patients had absolute neutrophil counts determined during the course of the study; 29 (63%) of 46 ganciclovir-treated patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia during treatment versus 9 (21%) of 43 control patients (P<.01).
Ganciclovir therapy begun in the neonatal period in symptomatically infected infants with CMV infection involving the central nervous system prevents hearing deterioration at 6 months and may prevent hearing deterioration at > or =1 year. Almost two thirds of treated infants have significant neutropenia during therapy.
The effect of a newly developed ophthalmic solution containing both 0.5% timolol and 2% resp. 4% pilocarpine was compared with that of timolol 0.5% eye drops alone in 93 patients with manifest simple or capsular glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The medications were administered twice daily. The absolute additive effect of pilocarpine was small, although the combined solutions caused a statistically significantly greater reduction of the intraocular pressure than that achieved by timolol alone. This additional effect appeared to last at least 12 h. The effect of the test solutions containing 2% resp. 4% pilocarpine was very similar. Apart from the well-known effects of the pilocarpine-induced miosis, the combined test medications were generally well tolerated.
The association between colonic cleansing and hypokalaemia was studied prospectively by monitoring the serum potassium levels in four groups of patients: groups 1 (55 patients), 2 (72 patients), and 3 (97 patients) received the same 2-day preparation of 15 g magnesium sulphate and 10 mg bisacodyl twice daily; group 4 (96 patients) received a 1-day preparation of 2.4 mg sennoside per kg of bodyweight. Groups 1 and 2 were on diuretics, but only group 2 received potassium supplementation. Serum potassium levels were measured before and after bowel preparation. Hypokalaemia was present prior to cleansing in six (11%), and after cleansing in 20 (36%) of the 55 patients in the group 1 patients on diuretics but without potassium supplements. There was, after cleansing, no significant fall in serum potassium in the group 2 patients on diuretics who received potassium supplements. No hyperkalaemia resulted from supplementation. A significant fall of the mean level of serum potassium occurred in patients in both group 3 (2-day-preparation) and group 4 (1-day-preparation). We conclude that both 1 day and 2 days of cleansing with cathartics may result in a significant fall in serum potassium, which can be prevented by oral potassium supplements. Potassium supplements (three times a day 15 ml of potassium chloride with 0.9 mmol K per ml during the preparation) in patients on diuretics may be prudent to avoid the risk of cardiac arrhythmia.
To study the calcium-dependent mechanisms contributing to altered contractile function in isoproterenol-induced ventricular hypertrophy of the rat heart.
The force-interval relationship, systemic evaluation of changed contractile force and calcium sensitivity of the myofilaments were investigated using small trabecular muscle from hearts with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by daily subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol for 12 days. The calcium sensitivity of myofilaments was studied using non-ionic detergent (Triton-X-100)-skinned trabeculae. The contractile force was evaluated at various concentrations of extracellular calcium and muscle lengths. The force-interval relationship was used to reflect altered intracellular calcium handling.
The isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy was associated with significantly enhanced contractile force at various concentrations of extracellular calcium and muscle lengths. Also, an amplified force-interval relationship in hypertrophied muscle at long rest intervals was found. However, this study revealed no change in calcium sensitivity of myofilaments.
Altered intracellullar calcium handling contributes to enhanced contractile force in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
A patient with acute myeloblastic leukaemia developed jaundice revealing peliosis hepatis after receiving 6-thioguanine for two months. Peliosis hepatis was severe and was associated with mild lesions of centrilobular veins. Withdrawal of 6-thioguanine was followed by a progressive improvement of liver dysfunction. This report shows that 6-thioguanine, a thiopurine already reported to be responsible for veno-occlusive disease of the liver, can induce peliosis hepatis. This suggests that some liver vascular disorders caused by thiopurines (6-thioguanine, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine), particularly peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive disease, sinusoidal dilatation and perisinusoidal fibrosis, might be related syndromes caused by similar lesions at different sites.
Although inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been shown to protect against cisplatin-induced hearing loss, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. In the present study, we aim to investigate the protective effect of trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of HDACs, on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and to determine the differentially expressed genes involved in this process.
The basilar membrane of the cochlea was isolated from 3-day newborn Wistar rats. Organotypic cultures were treated with 150 μM cisplatin or 200 nM TSA. For combination treatment, cells were pre-incubated with TSA for 1h, followed by TSA plus cisplatin treatment. Rhodamine-phalloidin staining was used to label hair cells, and immunocytochemistry with an anti-neurofilament-200 antibody was applied to label spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Global expression profile microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Molecular function and signal pathway analysis were performed using a protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER) classification system. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out for data validation.
Severe loss of hair cells and SGNs occurred after 48 h of cisplatin incubation, while TSA significantly increased the number of hair cells and SGNs in the combination treatment group (P<0.05). Compared with control, expression of 71 genes were up-regulated and 383 genes were down-regulated upon cisplatin treatment. Addition of TSA induced the up-regulation of 1387 genes and down-regulation of 1226 genes as compared with cisplatin administration alone. After cisplatin treatment, we observed significant down-regulation of mRNA for several genes related to synaptic function genes, including Camk2a, Camk2b, Vglut1, Snap25 and Rab3b, whereas pretreatment with TSA elevated mRNA levels of these genes. TSA greatly decreased expression of genes related to the calcium signaling pathway (Capn1 and Capn2) and apoptosis signaling pathway (Tnfrsf1a and Tp53), while addition of TSA significantly reduced levels of Tnfrsf1a and Tp53 compared with cisplatin alone (P<0.01).
Our results suggested that TSA might protect against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity via mediating expression of genes responsible for regulating apoptosis, intracellular calcium homeostasis, neurotransmitter synthesis and release, and synaptic plasticity.
