To review the literature regarding the dosage of amphotericin B in Candida infections. The correlation or rationale of current dosing practices is assessed in light of the literature.
A MEDLINE search encompassing the years 1968-1995 was used to identify pertinent literature. Additional references were obtained from the articles retrieved from MEDLINE.
Studies that directly assessed amphotericin B dosage and/or duration, pharmacokinetic literature dealing with plasma concentrations and amphotericin B disposition, and literature dealing with dose and/or concentration as well as clinical outcome were selected for inclusion. Additional relevant citations were used in the introductory material and discussion.
Although there was a large number of articles related to amphotericin B, surprisingly few large studies were designed to address the issues in question. The description of the methods and results of these heterogeneous articles are the basis of this review. Although additional controlled studies with more subjects need to be performed, the results to date provide a foundation from which to make some inferences regarding optimal use of this therapeutic modality until more definitive data become available.
Despite numerous articles addressing the pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B, little is known about its tissue distribution, the rate of transfer of the drug from vascular to peripheral sites, or its terminal disposition. Less information is available regarding the relevance of pharmacokinetic parameters or serum concentrations to clinical outcome. Most of the articles mentioning dosing provide little or no justification for the doses employed. The variety of the dosages used and the heterogeneity of the populations studied make determination of dose-outcome relationships difficult.
From the available clinical data, it appears that early initiation of amphotericin B therapy is crucial to a favorable outcome. Daily dosing initially followed by every-other-day administration of twice the daily dose is better tolerated by the patient than daily dosing and produces a similar therapeutic outcome. The drug should be continued until therapeutic endpoints have been achieved, rather than until a specific total dosage has been administered. The nephrotoxicity that occurs with amphotericin B administration is apparently reversible and should not be used as an endpoint for therapy if total dosages do not exceed 4 g. Additional well-designed, controlled trials evaluating standardized dosing methods of amphotericin B with predetermined dosing regimens and/or definitive therapeutic endpoints are needed to determine the optimal dosing approach for this agent.
Renin and catecholamine levels were determined in patients with mild to moderate hypertension before and after treatment with sustained release diltiazem or captopril and were correlated with the blood pressure response to these antihypertensives. Eight weeks of treatment with either agent led to equal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma norepinephrine did not predict the blood pressure response to either agent. Diltiazem significantly increased both PRA and supine norepinephrine levels. However, in the diltiazem treated patients, there was no correlation between the change in plasma norepinephrine and the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, there was a negative correlation (P less than .05) between the reactive rise in PRA and the decrease in systolic blood pressure. Thus, the antihypertensive response to a calcium channel blocker may be determined, in part, by the reactive response of pressor systems.
The present study explored the involvement of cyclooxygenase (COX) in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Further, the protective effect of COX-inhibitors against perphenazine-induced catatonia and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tertahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced striatal lesions in rats was evaluated. Administration of perphenazine (5 mg/kg., i.p.) produced severe catatonia (rigid behavior) in rats; the maximum score reached at 4 h (estimated as 100% AUC) and declined within 24 h. An intrastriatal injection of MPTP produced hypolocomotor activity in rats. Both perphenazine and MPTP produced oxidative stress as demonstrated by increased levels of lipid peroxides, nitrite and decreased antioxidant defense system in the whole brain and striatal region, in particular. Pretreatment with various COX-inhibitors viz. rofecoxib, celecoxib, nimesulide or naproxen offered protection against perphenazine-induced catatonia, the effect was more pronounced with rofecoxib. Rofecoxib and celecoxib (both selective COX-2 inhibitors) also reversed the perphenazine-induced oxidative stress. Further, prior treatment with rofecoxib (8 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed both the behavioral and biochemical changes induced by MPTP. These results suggest that COX-inhibitors particularly, rofecoxib offers protection against drug-induced catatonia and MPTP-induced striatal lesions possibly by modulating dopaminergic neurotransmission and/or oxidative stress.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DM/Q (capsules containing dextromethorphan [DM] and quinidine [Q]) compared with placebo, taken twice daily, for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect over a 12-week period in multiple sclerosis patients.
A total of 150 patients were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess pseudobulbar affect with the validated Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale. Each patient also recorded the number of episodes experienced between visits, estimated quality of life and quality of relationships on visual analog scales, and completed a pain rating scale.
Patients receiving DM/Q had greater reductions in Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale scores than those receiving placebo (p < 0.0001) at all clinic visits (days 15, 29, 57, and 85). All secondary end points also favored DM/Q, including the number of crying or laughing episodes (p <or= 0.0077), quality of life (p < 0.0001), quality of relationships (p = 0.0001), and pain intensity score (p = 0.0271). DM/Q was well tolerated; only dizziness occurred with greater frequency than with placebo.
Results in multiple sclerosis patients were similar to those of a previous study in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, demonstrating that DM/Q may be beneficial in treating potentially disabling pseudobulbar affect in a variety of neurological disorders.
In a prospective, randomised double blind study of 47 phlebographies, diatrizoate and ioxaglate were compared with regard to possible postphlebographic thrombosis proved by 125I-Fibrinogen uptake test. A significantly lower rate of postphlebographic thrombosis was registered when the low-osmolar ioxaglate was used.
A case is presented of a young man aged 25 years who had an episode of jaundice and renal failure after using a small amount of ecstasy and cocaine. There is a discussion of the issues raised by the case as well as some points of interest for research and health education.
A double-blind cross-over study was performed on 22 asthmatic patients receiving maintenance treatment with theophylline who, in a previous study, had reported sleep problems. In one of two three-week periods the theophylline medication was replaced by an equipotent dose of slow-release enprofylline. Analysis of sleep questionnaires answered after each treatment period, and sleep diaries filled in throughout the study, showed no significant differences in the quality of sleep between the treatments. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the morning did not differ between the treatment periods, but mean PEF in the evening was slightly higher (20 l/min) during theophylline treatment. It was concluded that replacement of theophylline by enprofylline did not improve the quality of sleep subjectively in this group of theophylline treated asthmatics. The results suggest that adenosine receptor antagonism may not be a significant cause of sleep disturbances in asthmatic patients who are receiving theophylline as maintenance treatment.
Resveratrol, a natural antioxidant and polyphenol found in grapes and wine, has been found to pharmacologically precondition the heart through the upregulation of nitric oxide (NO). To gain further insight of the role of NO in resveratrol preconditioning, mouse hearts devoid of any copies of inhibitory NO synthase (iNOS) (iNOS knockout) and corresponding wild-type hearts were perfused with 10 microM resveratrol for 15 min followed by 25 min of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion. Control experiments were performed with wild-type and iNOS knockout hearts that were not treated with resveratrol. Resveratrol-treated wild-type mouse hearts displayed significant improvement in postischemic ventricular functional recovery compared with those of nontreated hearts. Both resveratrol-treated and nontreated iNOS knockout mouse hearts resulted in relatively poor recovery in ventricular function compared with wild-type resveratrol-treated hearts. Myocardial infarct size was lower in the resveratrol-treated wild-type mouse hearts compared with other group of hearts. In concert, a number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes was lower in the wild-type mouse hearts treated with resveratrol. Cardioprotective effects of resveratrol was abolished when the wild-type mouse hearts were simultaneously perfused with aminoguanidine, an iNOS inhibitor. Resveratrol induced the expression of iNOS in the wild-type mouse hearts, but not in the iNOS knockout hearts, after only 30 min of reperfusion. Expression of iNOS remained high even after 2 h of reperfusion. Resveratrol-treated wild-type mouse hearts were subjected to a lower amount of oxidative stress as evidenced by reduced amount of malonaldehyde content in these hearts compared with iNOS knockout and untreated hearts. The results of this study demonstrated that resveratrol was unable to precondition iNOS knockout mouse hearts, whereas it could successfully precondition the wild-type mouse hearts, indicating an essential role of iNOS in resveratrol preconditioning of the heart.
A case of oestrogen toxicity in the dog is described. The bone marrow was primarily affected with resultant non-regenerative anaemia, leukocytosis followed by leukopaenia, and thrombocytopaenia. Endometritis, toxaemia and disseminate intravascular coagulation were complicating factors. The case terminated fatally intensive therapy.
Severe aplastic anemia developed in a patient after administration of quinacrine for treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus. Marrow transplantation was performed from an HLA genotypically identical sister after conditioning with cyclophosphamide. Quinacrine which was accumulated in the patient tissues did not interfere with engraftment, suggesting that the drug has no direct cytotoxic effect on hematopoietic stem cells. This study extends our previous observation that severe aplastic anemia acquired after exposure to drugs or toxins can be cured by marrow transplantation.
Transient focal neurologic deficits have been observed in patients emerging from brain tumor or carotid surgery, and a pharmacologic effect of anesthetic agents has been proposed as the cause of such neurologic dysfunction. Therefore, the effect of sedation with midazolam or fentanyl on motor neurologic function was studied prospectively and preoperatively in patients with carotid disease or mass lesions of the brain.
Fifty-four unpremedicated adult patients with carotid disease or a brain tumor were given small intravenous doses of either 2.8 +/- 1.3 mg midazolam or 170 +/- 60 micrograms fentanyl in the preoperative period. A thorough motor examination was performed at baseline and after sedation by an individual who was unaware of the details of the patient's disease or symptoms. A mental status examination also was performed to control for the effects of inattentiveness or lack of cooperation during the neurologic examination.
Patients were sedated mildly but were fully cooperative. Focal motor deterioration occurred after sedation in 30% of patients, and the incidence was similar in patients in the fentanyl and midazolam groups. Among patients with a focal motor abnormality on baseline examination or a resolved prior motor deficit, 73% had exacerbation or unmasking of these signs by sedation, whereas no patient without a prior history of motor dysfunction had a sedative-induced change. Sedative-induced changes in neurologic function ranged from unilateral mild weakness to complete plegia, but appeared to be transient in nature.
Sedation with midazolam or fentanyl can transiently exacerbate or unmask focal motor deficits in patients with prior motor dysfunction.
Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a stable fluorosurfactant and global pollutant, can be bioaccumulated. Recently, the possible adverse effects of PFOS on human health have raised concern. In this study, we examined the effects of PFOS on the expression of three important receptors related to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, six inflammatory-related genes, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of cell adhesion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results demonstrated that the expression of PPARγ and ERα were up-regulated after exposure to PFOS. After a high dose exposure (100 mg/L) for 48 h, the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, NOS3, ICAM-1 and P-Selectin were all notably up-regulated, whereas all of them did not show any significant changes after a low dose exposure (50 mg/L) for 24 h. Moreover, the expression of IL-1β, COX-2 and NOS3 were significantly up-regulated, when cells were exposed to 100 mg/L PFOS for 24 h. Meanwhile, the amount of ROS induced by the exposure to high-dose PFOS was significantly increased with increasing incubation times. Furthermore, the adhesion of THP-1 cells onto HUVECs was significantly increased after exposure to 100 mg/L PFOS for 48 h, as observed for the expression of ICAM-1 and P-Selectin. In conclusion, our data suggest that PFOS exposure may play an important role in the vascular inflammatory disorders and endothelial dysfunctions.
Accumulating evidence has suggested the importance of hypoxia in the initiation and development of atherosclerotic lesion, and hypoxia has a profound impact on endothelial cell properties during cardiovascular disease processes. Paeoniflorin, isolated from the root of Paeonia lactiflora pall, can protect endothelial cells from hypoxic damage in a variety of ways, such as by enhancing the production of nitric oxide (NO) and decreasing the expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). This study evaluated the protective effects of paeoniflorin against cobalt chloride (CoCl2, a hypoxia-mimicking agent)-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells (CRL-1730) and the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Endothelial cells were exposed to CoCl2 with or without pre-treatment with different concentrations of paeoniflorin. After treated with 0.6mM CoCl2 for 24 h, endothelial cells showed significant decrease in cell viability and increased apoptosis rate, which could be reversed by pre-treatment with paeoniflorin. Similarly, pre-treatment with paeoniflorin could prevent CoCl2-induced hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α) accumulation and down-regulate the expressions of p53 and Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3). These findings indicate that paeoniflorin had effective protection against hypoxia-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells and that HIF-1α, p53 and BNIP3 might be involved in this process.
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a phenomenon in which cells become resistant to cytostatic drugs and other substances with diverse chemical structures and cytotoxicity mechanisms. The most often observed molecular mechanism for MDR includes high levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)--an ABCB1 member of the ABC drug transporter family. Overexpression of P-gp in neoplastic tissue is an obstacle to chemotherapeutic treatment. Herein, we were focused on differences in apoptosis induced by cisplatin (no substrate for P-gp) between P-gp-positive and P-gp-negative L1210 cells. P-gp-positive cells were obtained by either L1210 cell adaptation to vincristine (R) or L1210 cell transfection with the human gene for P-gp (T) and compared with parental L1210 cells (S). R and T cells were more resistant to CisPt than S cells. R and T cell resistance to CisPt-induced apoptosis could not be reversed by verapamil (a well-known P-gp inhibitor), which excludes P-gp transport activity as a cause of CisPt resistance. CisPt induced a more pronounced entry into apoptosis in S than R and T cells, which was measured using the annexin-V/propidium iodide apoptosis kit. CisPt induced more pronounced caspase-3 activation in S than R and T cells. CisPt did not induce changes in the P-gp protein level for R and T cells. While similar levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were observed in P-gp-negative and P-gp-positive cells, CisPt induced a more significant decrease in Bcl-2 levels for S cells than P-gp-positive cells. Expression of p53 and its molecular chaperone Hsp90 were more pronounced in R and T than S cells. Moreover, CisPt enhanced the upregulation of p53 and Hsp90 in R and T cells to a higher degree than S cells. Apoptosis was shown to be the prevalent mode of cell death in S, R and T cells by the typical DNA fragmentation and cell ultrastructure changes. All of the above findings indicate that P-gp, independent of its drug efflux activity, induced changes in cell regulatory pathways that confer a partial loss of cisplatin sensitivity.
A 77-year-old woman who had undergone surgery of a non-malignant extracerebral retro-orbital tumor suffered postoperatively from respiratory failure due to impaired respiratory drive and unconsciousness of unknown origin and required artificial ventilation for 14 days. After cerebral and endocrinological causes had been excluded, the residual effects of diazepam were taken into consideration, since the patient had received this substance for premedication and during 3 days postoperatively (total 165 mg). After the application of flumazenil (Anexate), a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, she awoke immediately and was extubated with sufficient spontaneous breathing. The hypothesis that diazepam was the causative agent for the respiratory failure and impaired consciousness was supported by the detection of high serum concentrations of diazepam and its active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. During the following 3 days repetitive injections of flumazenil were necessary to counteract recurring depression of respiration and vigilance. Thereafter further application of flumazenil was not necessary.
In this prospective study the early cognitive development of children born to women with epilepsy (n = 198) was assessed and compared to a group of children representative of the general population (n = 230).
The children were assessed when younger than the age of 2 years using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales, either in their local participating hospital or in their home. The assessments were completed by an assessor who was blinded to whether the child's mother had epilepsy and to antiepileptic drug type.
Children exposed to sodium valproate had a statistically significant increased risk of delayed early development in comparison to the control children. Linear regression analysis showed a statistically significant effect of sodium valproate exposure on the child's overall developmental level that was not accounted for by confounding variables. Delayed early development is also noted for children within an ad hoc group of less commonly utilized antiepileptic drugs, although conclusions cannot be drawn due to the size of this group (n = 13). Children exposed to either carbamazepine or lamotrigine in utero did not differ significantly in their overall developmental ability. Differences noted in specific developmental areas for these two groups were not statistically significant after the control for confounders such as socioeconomic status and maternal IQ.
Women with epilepsy should be informed of the risks posed to their potential offspring prior to pregnancy to allow for informed decisions regarding treatment. Children exposed in utero to antiepileptic drugs should be monitored throughout childhood to allow for early intervention when necessary.
1. Morphine pretreatment (8.0 mg/kg s.c.) induced no overt tolerance to its antinociceptive effect in mice 4 h later, but enhanced the antagonistic potency of naloxone. 2. A molecular sieve morphine pellet implanted for 24 h induced measurable tolerance, but the relative potency of naloxone was not significantly different from that observed after single-dose morphine pretreatment. The development of tolerance and increased naloxone potency do not, therefore, run parallel. 3. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms were observed after single-dose morphine and after pellet implantation. However, molecular sieve morphine pellet implantation induced a higher degree of dependence as compared with single dose morphine pretreatment. 4. These results indicate that the rate of development of increased naloxone potency and of morphine tolerance and dependence do not run parallel. This implies that caution must be exercised in regarding increased naloxone potency as a sensitive indicator of the initiation and development of tolerance and dependence to morphine.
A new type of glomerulonephritis following a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection has been reported. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the clinicopathological features and the responsiveness to treatment of the disease.
We studied the treatment of 8 patients with glomerulonephritis related to MRSA infection. We observed the eight cases and analyzed clinical features, laboratory findings and histopathological data.
On admission, all patients had no renal abnormalities. One to four months after suffering from MRSA infection, severe proteinuria and hematuria developed. Renal biopsy specimens revealed moderate to severe mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with various degrees of crescent formation. Immunofluorescence studies showed IgA and C3. Antibiotic therapy was performed in six cases, resulting in successfully reducing the proteinuria in parallel with the decreased activity of MRSA infection in five cases. The other 2 cases received corticosteroid treatment after complete cessation of MRSA infection, but they had a relapse of MRSA infection and later died from sepsis.
These results suggested that MRSA-associated glomerulonephritis might respond to antibiotic treatment in most cases. This also indicated that special care must be taken in the application of steroid therapy for the glomerulonephritis with crescents, even though the MRSA infection has gone into an inactive state.
The aim of the study was to assess the possible association, in hypertensive patients, between left ventricular myocardial diastolic dysfunction and coronary flow reserve (CFR) in relation to the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
Twenty-eight untreated hypertensives (22 males, 6 females, mean age 53.1 years), free of coronary artery disease, were enrolled in the study. Standard Doppler echocardiography, color Doppler tissue imaging of the posterior septum during dobutamine stress and second harmonic Doppler of the distal left anterior descending coronary vessel, at baseline and after maximal hyperemia induced by dipyridamole, were performed. CFR was estimated as the ratio between hyperemic and baseline diastolic velocities. Hypertensives were divided into two groups according to the left ventricular mass index: 15 without LVH (left ventricular mass index < 51 g/m2.7) and 13 with LVH (left ventricular mass index > 51 g/m2.7). The two groups were comparable for sex prevalence, age, body mass index, baseline heart rate and blood pressure.
Color Doppler tissue imaging did not show any significant difference of both the baseline and high-dobutamine septal systolic peak velocities between the two groups. The ratio between myocardial early and atrial peak velocities (Em/Am ratio) was lower in patients with LVH, either at baseline (p < 0.01) or at high-dose dobutamine (p < 0.0001). Also, CFR was lower in the presence of LVH (p < 0.01). After adjusting for age, body mass index, left ventricular mass index, diastolic blood pressure and high-dose dobutamine heart rate by a multiple linear regression analysis, the high-dose dobutamine Em/Am ratio was an independent contributor of CFR in the overall hypertensive population (beta = 0.65, p < 0.0001) (cumulative r2 = 0.38, p < 0.0001).
The combined use of second harmonic Doppler and color Doppler tissue imaging identifies, in arterial hypertension, an association between myocardial diastolic properties and CFR, independent of the presence of LVH. In hypertensive patients free of coronary artery stenosis, left ventricular myocardial diastolic dysfunction may be a determinant in the impairment of the coronary microvessel vasodilation capacity or a marker of silent ischemia involving the microvascular circulation.
Between 1980 and 1985, 2,012 patients treated with acenocoumarol were followed up. 31 of them had intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), representing an incidence of 1.54%. Its mortality rate was as high as 45%. The most common indication of anticoagulant therapy was cardiac valvular disease. No precipitating factors or concomitant hemorrhages in other sites were detected. Most patients with ICH were, at the time of the accident, within the therapeutic anticoagulant range. The most common localization of ICH was intraparenchymal; most of them developed after one year of anticoagulant therapy. In 32% of instances there was previous hypertension and previous stroke in 26%. ICH had a three times greater incidence in patients over 65 years. The patients who died showed larger hematomas than survivors in computed tomography.
A patient with primary biliary cirrhosis is reported in whom the administration of clofibrate in a dose of 1 g per day for 2 months resulted in a marked increase in hypercholesterolemia, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed multiple intrahepatic gallstones. The stones disappeared 3 months after stopping clofibrate and starting chenodeoxycholic acid in a dose of 125 mg daily. These observations are discussed in relation to the known effects of clofibrate on bile composition.
Prenatal insults can program the developing fetus to develop diseases that manifest in later life. Dexamethasone is often administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether prenatal dexamethasone adversely affects renal development and predisposes rats to develop renal disease and hypertension in later life.
Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or two daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on gestational days: 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, 19 and 20, or 20 and 21. Tail cuff blood pressure, glomerular number, and inulin clearance were measured in control and prenatal dexamethasone-treated rats when the rats were 60 to 90 days of age.
Prenatal dexamethasone did not affect the length of gestation, the number of animals per litter, or the total body weight or kidney weight measured at one day of age. Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 30% reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 60 to 70 days of age (24,236 +/- 441 vs. 30,453 +/- 579, P < 0.01). Rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 had an approximate 20% reduction in glomeruli compared with control (P < 0.01). Offspring of rats receiving dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had systolic blood pressures at 60 to 90 days of age that were higher than any other group (P < 0.05). The glomerular filtration rate was comparable in all of the groups.
This study shows that two daily doses of prenatal dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg body weight) in rats do not produce intrauterine growth retardation. Adult offspring of rats that received prenatal dexamethasone during specific times of gestation have a reduced number of nephrons and hypertension.
