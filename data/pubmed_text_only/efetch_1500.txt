The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania in children and adolescents.
This was an 8-week, open-label, prospective study of olanzapine monotherapy (dose range 2.5-20 mg/day) involving 23 bipolar youths (manic, mixed, or hypomanic; 5-14 years old). Weekly assessments were made using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Children's Depression Rating Scale. Adverse events were assessed through self-reports, vital sign and weight monitoring, laboratory analytes, and extrapyramidal symptom rating scales (Barnes Akathisia Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale, and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale).
Twenty-two of the 23 youths (96%) completed the study. Olanzapine treatment was associated with significant improvement in mean YMRS score (-19.0 +/- 9.2, p < 0.001). Using predefined criteria for improvement of > or = 30% decline in the YMRS and a CGI-S Mania score of < or = 3 at endpoint, the overall response rate was 61%. Overall, olanzapine was well tolerated, and extrapyramidal symptom measures were not significantly different from baseline. Body weight increased significantly over the study (5.0 +/- 2.3 kg, p < 0.001).
Open-label olanzapine treatment was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of acute mania in youths with bipolar disorder. Future placebo-controlled, double-blind studies are warranted.
Methamphetamine [METH ("speed")] is an abused psychostimulant that can cause psychotic, cognitive, and psychomotor impairment in humans. These signs and symptoms are thought to be related to dysfunctions in basal ganglionic structures of the brain. To identify possible molecular bases for these clinical manifestations, we first used cDNA microarray technology to measure METH-induced transcriptional responses in the striatum of rats treated with an apoptosis-inducing dose of the drug. METH injection resulted in increased expression of members of the Jun, Egr, and Nur77 subfamilies of transcription factors (TFs), changes that were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Because pathways linked to these factors are involved in the up-regulation of Fas ligand (FasL), FasL mRNA was quantified and found to be increased. Immunohistochemical studies also revealed METH-induced increased FasL protein expression in striatal GABAergic neurons that express enkephalin. Moreover, there were METH-mediated increases in calcineurin, as well as shuttling of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)c3 and NFATc4 from the cytosol to the nucleus of METH-treated rats, mechanisms also known to be involved in FasL regulation. Furthermore, METH induced cleavage of caspase-3 in FasL- and Fas-containing neurons. Finally, the METH-induced changes in the FasL-Fas death pathway were attenuated by pretreatment with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, which also caused attenuation of METH-induced apoptosis. These observations indicate that METH causes some of its neurodegenerative effects, in part, via stimulation of the Fas-mediated cell death pathway consequent to FasL up-regulation mediated by activation of multiple TFs.
Acute lung injury caused by gastric aspiration is a frequent occurrence in unconscious patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome in association with gastric aspiration carries a mortality of up to 30% and accounts for up to 20% of deaths associated with anesthesia. Although the clinical condition is well known, knowledge about the exact inflammatory mechanisms is still incomplete. This study was performed to define the role of alveolar macrophages in this inflammatory response. In addition, potentially modifying effects of intratracheally applied nuclear factor kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate were investigated.
Rat alveolar macrophages were depleted by intratracheal administration of clodronate liposomes, and lung injury was evaluated 6 h after instillation of 0.1N hydrochloric acid. In a second set of experiments, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was intratracheally instilled 3 h after hydrochloric acid application, and injury parameters were determined.
Depletion of alveolar macrophages resulted in decreased production of inflammatory mediators in acid aspiration (23-80% reduction of messenger RNA or protein of inflammatory mediators; P < 0.05) and consequently also in diminished neutrophil recruitment (36% fewer neutrophils; P < 0.01). Treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was highly effective in decreasing neutrophil recruitment (66%; P < 0.01) and vascular permeability (80%; P < 0.001).
These data suggest that alveolar macrophages play an essential role in the inflammatory response of acid-induced lung injury. For the first time, attenuation of acid-induced lung injury with an inhibitor, applied after the onset of injury, is shown.
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 5-HT(2A) receptors have been shown to modulate dopamine (DA) function and a more thorough appreciation of this modulatory interaction between 5-HT2A receptors and DA systems may yield insight into novel approaches to treatment of cocaine dependence. The present study examined the effects of two ligands with varying selectivity for 5-HT2A receptors on the locomotor stimulant and discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine in male rats. Locomotor activity was measured following intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (1 ml/kg), the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 [R-(+)-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidine-methanol] (0.02-2.0 mg/kg), or the 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.04-4 mg/kg) 45 min before administration of saline (1 ml/kg) or cocaine (10 mg/kg); monitoring of activity in photobeam chambers began at once and proceeded for 1 h. Neither M100907 nor ketanserin significantly altered basal locomotor activity, but both drugs attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity (p < 0.05). In drug discrimination studies, rats were trained to discriminate cocaine (10 mg/kg) from saline (1 ml/kg) in a two-lever, water-reinforced operant task. M100907 (0.05-1.6 mg/kg) and ketanserin (0.05-4 mg/kg) evoked a dose-related attenuation of the stimulus effects of cocaine (5 mg/kg, p < 0.05). These results suggest that 5-HT2A receptors play an important role in the behavioral effects of cocaine and that 5-HT2A receptors should be considered a viable target for analysis in the search for pharmacotherapies useful in the treatment of cocaine dependence.
A 20 years old female patient with epileptic seizures (bilateral myoclonus and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (bilateral myoclonus and generalized tonic-clonic seizures) since the age of 13 was treated with valproic acid. Eight hours after 2 of 3 prophylactic antimalarial treatments with mefloquine generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred. A causal relationship is suggested.
A unique chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), provisionally called "mustard lung", which occurs as a late complication of sulfur mustard (SM) exposure among SM-exposed Iranians, is presently poorly characterized. This investigation evaluates p53 immunoreactivity in bronchial epithelium of individuals with histories of tobacco use and/or SM exposure, as a tool to help define mustard lung. In this study, 68 COPD patients were segregated into two groups, 35 mustard-exposed patients (including 8 smokers) and 33 unexposed patients (including 16 smokers). Disease severity was assessed with pulmonary function tests. p53 protein in bronchial tissue obtained as biopsies was quantitated by immunostaining. Among nonsmokers, 41.2% of unexposed subjects and 14.8% of exposed subjects expressed p53. Among smokers, 25% of the unexposed group and 50% of the exposed group expressed the protein. Initial data trends suggest an additive contribution of SM exposure and smoking to p53 immunoreactivity. These results illustrate the use of p53 immunoreactivity in the characterization of COPD, including mustard lung.
Fourteen patients with cirrhosis and bleeding esophageal varices were treated with propranolol. The dose of propranolol was determined by decreasing the resting heart rate by 25% 12 hr after an oral dose of propranolol which was given twice a day. Significant decreases in the hepatic venous pressure gradient and cardiac output after 1 month of propranolol administration was observed. To assess beta-adrenergic blockade, the isoproterenol test and plasma propranolol levels were evaluated. Increasing doses of isoproterenol were injected to increase the resting heart rate 25 beats per minute (chronotropic dose 25 or CD25 ). Plasma propranolol concentrations were measured in blood samples drawn 4 hr after the last oral dose. The mean CD25 was 5 +/- 2 micrograms before and 146 +/- 84 micrograms after 1 month of propranolol administration. The plasma propranolol level after 1 month of drug administration was 0.69 +/- 0.47 microM per liter i.e. 2.33 +/- 1.59 micrograms per ml. A significant correlation was found between the CD25 measured after continuous propranolol administration and plasma propranolol level. In conclusion, the efficacy of beta-adrenergic blockade was estimated by the isoproterenol test which correlates with the plasma propranolol level in patients with cirrhosis. This study suggests that the isoproterenol test is useful in assessing beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol in patients with cirrhosis.
A new case of acute cholestatic hepatitis in a 70-years-old woman treated with ticlopidine following stroke occurred 2 months previously is presented. The patient also presented anemia which became more severe during admission, but which was resolved following withdrawal of the drug with no involvement of the other 2 series. This is the first case reported with isolated anemia related to ticlopidine.
We report a severe case of drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) after allogeneic BMT successfully treated with levodopa. BMT patients typically receive numerous medications which can cause DIP, and mild cases of DIP may remain unrecognized or be misdiagnosed. Physicians should be aware of DIP as a potential neurological complication after BMT to avoid further administration of drugs that could aggravate symptoms.
Recent reports have shown that acute or chronic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) causes unpleasant side effects in patients. In the present study, through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), we found that chronic treatment with the SSRI paroxetine or the SNRI milnacipran significantly induced sleep disturbance, which was characterized by an increase in the total wake time and decreased total nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that chronic treatment with paroxetine or milnacipran significantly increased the mRNA levels of orexin 1 receptor and orexin 2 receptor in the hypothalamus and of histamine 1 receptor and histidine decarboxylase in the frontal cortex of mice. The present findings suggest that chronic treatment with either paroxetine or milnacipran causes sleep disturbance associated with an increase in orexinergic transmission in the hypothalamus and histaminergic transmission in the frontal cortex. Although further studies are needed, these imbalances in the orexinergic and histaminergic systems may be, at least in part, responsible for the pathogenesis of sleep disturbance induced by chronic treatment with SSRI or SNRI in rodents.
We found mutations in the gene PQBP1 in 5 of 29 families with nonsyndromic (MRX) and syndromic (MRXS) forms of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Clinical features in affected males include mental retardation, microcephaly, short stature, spastic paraplegia and midline defects. PQBP1 has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine expansion diseases. Our findings link this gene to XLMR and shed more light on the pathogenesis of this common disorder.
The angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist irbesartan is used for the treatment of hypertension, but its anti-ischaemic effect is not yet known. Our aim was to assess the effect of irbesartan administration on the diagnostic yield of 99mTc sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after dipyridamole stress.
Our study group consisted of 13 patients (11 men and two women; mean age, 53.3 +/- 10.6 years; body mass index, 26.9 +/- 3.3 kg x m(-2)) with angiographically documented CAD. All patients underwent SmTc sestamibi SPECT studies at rest, before (STRESS-1) and 2 weeks after irbesartan (150 mg daily) administration (STRESS-2) at dipyridamole stress. The extent and severity of defects were analysed by using visual and quantitative 99mTc sestamibi SPECT.
The mean summed stress score was significantly higher during the STRESS-1 study than the STRESS-2 study (13.2 +/- 7.4 vs. 11 +/- 7.4, P=0.003). The mean size of perfusion defects at stress was significantly larger for the STRESS-1 group than the STRESS-2 group (17.8% +/- 2.85% vs. 15.3% +/- 2.95%, P=0.01).
Our study showed that the AT1 receptor blocker irbesartan reduces the extent and severity of 99mTc sestamibi perfusion defects after dipyridamole stress in patients with CAD. Irbesartan may alter coronary blood flow reserve. The continued use of irbesartan before stress myocardial perfusion SPECT has a masking effect on stress induced myocardial perfusion defects. For this reason AT1 receptor blockers must be stopped before stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphic examinations.
Nicotine and ethanol are frequently co-abused in men and women, but few studies compare common stimulus effects produced by these substances between males and females.
This study compared the anxiety-like behavior induced by nicotine prior to and during ethanol withdrawal in intact male, sham-operated female, and ovariectomized (OVX) rats.
Using an animal model of anxiety, the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) drug-discrimination assay, rats were trained to discriminate PTZ (16 mg/kg, i.p.) from saline and were subjected to the following tests: (1) PTZ-lever selection at 12 h after termination of ethanol diet (4.5% for 10 days); (2) dose-response tests for nicotine (0.08-1.3 mg/kg) prior to ethanol and 1.5, 6, and 7 days after ethanol withdrawal.
(1) During acute ethanol withdrawal (12 h), more male rats (43.4%) responded on the PTZ lever than OVX (29%) or sham female (15.3%) rats. (2) For nicotine dose-response tests, more male rats (70%) selected the PTZ lever than OVX (37.5%) or sham female (50%) rats prior to ethanol. At 1.5 days, nicotine fully generalized to the PTZ stimulus in male (100%) and OVX (90%), but only partially in sham female (50%) rats. At 6 days and 7 days after ethanol withdrawal, the PTZ-lever selection decreased, but more male rats (78%) tended to respond on a PTZ lever than OVX (63.6%) or sham female rats (62.5%).
Acute nicotine produces anxiety-like behavior similar to that of PTZ in male and female rats, and this effect of nicotine is intensified during ethanol withdrawal in male and OVX rats, but not in sham female rats.
Exposures to two commercial nanofilm spray products (NFPs), a floor sealant (NFP 1) and a coating product for tiles (NFP 2), were investigated for airway irritation, airway inflammation, and lung damage in a mouse inhalation model. The particle exposure was characterized by particle number, particle size distribution, and gravimetric analysis. BALB/cJ mice were exposed for 60 min to the aerosolized products at 3.3-60 mg/m(3) (10(5)-10(6) fine particles/cm(3)) measured in the breathing zone of the mice. Lung inflammation and lung damage were assessed by study of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology, protein in BALF, and histology. Mass spectral analysis showed that NFP 1 and NFP 2 contained hydrolysates and condensates of a perfluorosilane and alkylsilane, respectively. NFP 1 induced a concentration-dependent decrease of the tidal volume lasting for at least 1 day. Exposure concentrations above 16.1 mg/m(3) (2.1 x 10(6) fine particles/cm(3)) gave rise to significant increases of protein level in BALF and reduced body weight, and histological examination showed atelectasis, emphysema, and hemorrhages. A narrow interval between the no-effect level (16.1 mg/m(3)) and the lethal concentrations (18.4 mg/m(3)) was observed. The alkylsilane-based product (NFP 2) had no effect at the concentrations studied. Experiments with different types of perfluorinated silanes and alkylsiloxanes showed that the toxic effects did not arise solely from the perfluorination. The number of free hydroxyl groups in the silanes/alkylsiloxanes was also critical for the toxicity.
Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine derived from macrophages, is considered to be an important endogenous mediator of endotoxic shock. Patients with fulminant hepatic failure are particularly susceptible to infection and the development of multi-organ failure and similarities to endotoxic shock suggest a possible pathogenetic role for TNF in fulminant hepatic failure. In vitro TNF production was therefore investigated serially in 21 consecutive patients with fulminant hepatic failure and in 21 healthy controls. Spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF production were elevated in viral-induced fulminant hepatic failure, compared with healthy controls (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). By contrast, patients with paracetamol-induced fulminant hepatic failure had normal spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF production, while those who died had significantly reduced spontaneous TNF production compared with survivors (P less than 0.02); this difference was present throughout admission. In this group elevations in TNF production above baseline were associated with Gram-positive bacterial or fungal infection but not Gram-negative bacterial infection. There was no correlation between any of the clinical complications of fulminant microbial stimuli in fulminant hepatic failure, but do not support a direct role for TNF in the evolution of the clinical complications of fulminant hepatic failure.
This article presents a young patient affected with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who developed acute myocardial infarction 7 days after treatment with epirubicin (90 mg/m2, day 1), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2, day 1), vincristine (2 mg, day 1), prednisolone (100 mg, days 1-5), and ondansetron (3 x 4 mg/day, days 1-2). Six months after the myocardial infarction the patient had no further cardiac complications after treatment with cylcophosphamide, vincristine, and ondansetron chemotherapy regimen. Epirubicin was considered to play an important role in the production of infarction, and the probable mechanisms of epirubicin-induced myocardial infarction are discussed.
Permethrin, the most popular insecticide among the synthetic pyrethroids, has been used worldwide to control a wide range of insects in agriculture, forestry, public health, and homes. Humans may have suffered potential exposure to this compound. The commercial formulation of permethrin contains trans and cis isomers. Here, at the same dosage, we made a comparison of the reproductive effects between these two isomers. Male adult ICR mice were orally administered trans- or cis-permethrin daily for 6 weeks at a dose of 0 or 70 mg/(kg day). In the cis-permethrin exposure group, the caudal epididymal sperm count and sperm motility were significantly reduced, and testosterone levels in testes and plasma also fell. Moreover, cis-permethrin induced abnormal seminiferous tubules in testes and suppressed testicular mRNA expression levels of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme. Although such adverse effects were not observed in the trans-permethrin exposure group, testicular and urinary metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid levels in trans-permethrin-exposed mice were about three- and sevenfold higher than those in cis-permethrin-exposed mice, respectively. Furthermore, in vitro, hepatic microsomal hydrolase activity for trans-permethrin was nearly 62-fold higher than that for cis-permethrin. Taken together, the difference in metabolic activity between cis- and trans-permethrin might contribute to the difference in the reproductive toxicity between both isomers.
Angiotensin (Ang) II promotes renal infiltration by immunocompetent cells in double-transgenic rats (dTGRs) harboring both human renin and angiotensinogen genes. To elucidate disease mechanisms, we investigated whether or not dexamethasone (DEXA) immunosuppression ameliorates renal damage. Untreated dTGRs developed hypertension, renal damage, and 50% mortality at 7 weeks. DEXA reduced albuminuria, renal fibrosis, vascular reactive oxygen stress, and prevented mortality, independent of blood pressure. In dTGR kidneys, p22phox immunostaining co-localized with macrophages and partially with T cells. dTGR dendritic cells expressed major histocompatibility complex II and CD86, indicating maturation. DEXA suppressed major histocompatibility complex II+, CD86+, dendritic, and T-cell infiltration. In additional experiments, we treated dTGRs with mycophenolate mofetil to inhibit T- and B-cell proliferation. Reno-protective actions of mycophenolate mofetil and its effect on dendritic and T cells were similar to those obtained with DEXA. We next investigated whether or not Ang II directly promotes dendritic cell maturation in vitro. Ang II did not alter CD80, CD83, and MHC II expression, but increased CCR7 expression and cell migration. To explore the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on dendritic cell maturation in vivo, we treated dTGRs with the soluble TNF-alpha receptor etanercept. This treatment had no effect on blood pressure, but decreased albuminuria, nuclear factor-kappaB activation, and infiltration of all immunocompetent cells. These data suggest that immunosuppression prevents dendritic cell maturation and T-cell infiltration in a nonimmune model of Ang II-induced renal damage. Ang II induces dendritic migration directly, whereas in vivo TNF-alpha is involved in dendritic cell infiltration and maturation. Thus, Ang II may initiate events leading to innate and acquired immune response.
Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Glivec; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has become the gold-standard treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Several tyrosine kinases inhibited by imatinib are expressed in the kidney, and although the drug is usually well tolerated, several cases of acute renal failure were reported. We describe for the first time a case of a patient treated by imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia who developed partial Fanconi syndrome with mild renal failure, which leads to a discussion of the pathophysiological characteristics of imatinib-induced renal toxicity. Patients on long-term imatinib treatment should be monitored for renal failure, as well as proximal tubule dysfunction, including hypophosphatemia.
Low-level environmental cadmium exposure in children may be associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Our aim was to evaluate associations between urinary cadmium concentration and reported learning disability (LD), special education utilization, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in U.S. children using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data.
We analyzed data from a subset of participants in NHANES (1999-2004) who were 6-15 years of age and had spot urine samples analyzed for cadmium. Outcomes were assessed by parent or proxy-respondent report. We fit multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models to estimate associations between urinary cadmium and the outcomes.
When we compared children in the highest quartile of urinary cadmium with those in the lowest quartile, odds ratios adjusted for several potential confounders were 3.21 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43, 7.17] for LD, 3.00 (95% CI: 1.12, 8.01) for special education, and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.61) for ADHD. There were no significant interactions with sex, but associations with LD and special education were somewhat stronger in males, and the trend in the ADHD analysis was only evident among those with blood lead levels above the median.
These findings suggest that children who have higher urinary cadmium concentrations may have increased risk of both LD and special education. Importantly, we observed these associations at exposure levels that were previously considered to be without adverse effects, and these levels are common among U.S. children.
Elevated total plasma homocysteine concentrations (tHcy), both fasting and post-methionine load, have been established as risk factors for vascular disease. Recently, we described the association of a 31 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene with both CBS enzyme activity and tHcy concentrations. In the present study, we determined the 31 bp VNTR genotypes in 2598 individuals of the Framingham Offspring Study and studied the association between this genotype and fasting, 2-h post-methionine load and delta (ie increase upon methionine loading) tHcy concentrations in 1416 subjects. We observed a positive association between the number of repeat units of the CBS 31 bp VNTR and both postload and delta tHcy concentrations. Adjustment for possible effect modifying factors like age, sex and vitamin (B6, B12 and folate) status did not change this observation. We hereby confirm the results of our earlier study, in which we found that this 31 bp VNTR is a genetic determinant of post-methionine load tHcy concentrations. Since also post-methionine load tHcy concentrations are found to be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), this 31 bp VNTR may be considered a risk factor for CVD.
A case of Hepatitis A is reported in a patient prescribed tamoxifen after surgery for breast cancer and taking tamoxifen 20 mg/day for two and a half years. Documented is the indirect development of Hepatitis A and tamoxifen-induced hepatic damage.
