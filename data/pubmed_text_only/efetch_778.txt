The aim of the present work was to study the characteristics of motor complications in a group of familial Parkinson's disease (fPD) patients in comparison with matched sporadic PD (sPD) patients. Fifty-one fPD and 51 sPD patients matched for age and disease duration, used as controls, were included in the study. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale was completed during clinical examination and all patients were questioned about the characteristics of motor complications. The mean time from start of L-dopa therapy to the onset of motor fluctuations (MF) and L-dopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) as well as the mean time from symptom onset to the development of MF and LID was significantly shorter in the fPD group of patients. An analysis revealed a higher occurrence of MF and LID in fPD patients in the group with disease duration of 5 years or less. FPD may be associated with a higher prevalence and earlier onset of motor complications during the initial stages of the disease. Genetic factors may contribute to the specific characteristics of motor complications in fPD.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether central beta-adrenoceptors are involved in stress-induced cardiovascular responses in rats. Using a biotelemetry system, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest and during stress induced by immersion in 1 cm-deep water. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, DL-propranolol (5 or 50 microg), significantly and dose dependently attenuated the tachycardia induced by water immersion stress (drug-induced reduction of tachycardia at 5 min after the start of stress: 61.4 +/- 13.2% for 5 microg, 72.5 +/- 8.2% for 50 microg). The same doses of DL-propranolol had no effect on the resting heart rate. Injection (i.c.v.) of a lower dose (5 microg) of D-propranolol--which has a lower potency as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist than DL-propranolol, but a similar local anesthetic, membrane-stabilizing activity--did not attenuate the stress-induced tachycardia, although a higher dose (50 microg) did. Intravenous administration of DL-propranolol (5 or 50 microg) significantly attenuated the stress-induced tachycardia (drug-induced reduction of tachycardia at 5 min after the start of stress: 20.0 +/- 7.5% for 5 microg, 42.4 +/- 3.4% for 50 microg). However, the attenuation was much smaller than in the i.c.v. DL-propranolol-injected group. The i.c.v. injection of the 50 microg dose of DL-propranolol significantly augmented both the resting blood pressure and the pressor response to water immersion stress, whereas the lower dose (5 microg) had no effect. The i.c.v. injection of 50 microg D-propranolol also augmented, although not significantly, the resting blood pressure and the pressor response to stress. These results suggest that central beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the tachycardia induced by water immersion stress in rats.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of trabectedin in clear cell carcinoma (CCC) of the ovary, which is regarded as an aggressive, chemoresistant, histologic subtype.
Using 6 human ovarian cancer cell lines (3 CCC and 3 serous adenocarcinomas), the antitumor effects of trabectedin were examined in vitro, and we compared its activity according to histology. We next examined the antitumor activity of trabectedin in both cisplatin-resistant and paclitaxel-resistant CCC cells in vitro. Then, the in vivo effects of trabectedin were evaluated using mice inoculated with CCC cell lines. Using 2 pairs of trabectedin-sensitive parental and trabectedin-resistant CCC sublines, we investigated the role of mTOR in the mechanism of acquired resistance to trabectedin. Finally, we determined the effect of mTOR inhibition by everolimus on the antitumor efficacy of trabectedin in vitro and in vivo.
Trabectedin showed significant antitumor activity toward chemosensitive and chemoresistant CCC cells in vitro. Mouse xenografts of CCC cells revealed that trabectedin significantly inhibits tumor growth. Greater activation of mTOR was observed in trabectedin-resistant CCC cells than in their respective parental cells. The continuous inhibition of mTOR significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of trabectedin and prevented CCC cells from acquiring resistance to trabectedin.
Trabectedin is a promising agent for CCC as a first-line chemotherapy and as a second-line treatment of recurrent CCC that had previously been treated with cisplatin or paclitaxel. Moreover, trabectedin combined with everolimus may be more efficacious for the management of CCC.
The frequency of postoperative infections in oncologic head and neck surgery can be reduced by the prophylactic use of antibiotics. In order to assess such preventive treatments as to their advantages and disadvantages, a controlled clinical trial was undertaken. The prophylactic use of antibiotics was used in 107 patients, operated for tumors of the upper airway-digestive tract. According to a previous randomisation, the patients received either carbenicillin either ticarcillin. The efficiency of carbenicillin and ticarcillin proved similar. The results obtained with these antibiotics turned out to be superior to those previously obtained with combined ampicillin and cloxacillin; the number of wound infections, primary and secondary, was lessened. The most frequent complications were thrombophlebitis at the site of intravenous perfusion of the antibiotics and hypokaliemia.
Elucidating genetic causes of cholestasis has proved to be important in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of the liver. Here we show that protein-truncating mutations in the tight junction protein 2 gene (TJP2) cause failure of protein localization and disruption of tight-junction structure, leading to severe cholestatic liver disease. These findings contrast with those in the embryonic-lethal knockout mouse, highlighting differences in redundancy in junctional complexes between organs and species.
We provide evidence that arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) targets the BCR-ABL oncoprotein via a novel mechanism involving p62/SQSTM1-mediated localization of the oncoprotein to the autolysosomes and subsequent degradation mediated by the protease cathepsin B. Our studies demonstrate that inhibitors of autophagy or cathepsin B activity and/or molecular targeting of p62/SQSTM1, Atg7, or cathepsin B result in partial reversal of the suppressive effects of AS(2)O(3) on BCR-ABL expressing leukemic progenitors, including primitive leukemic precursors from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. Altogether, these findings indicate that autophagic degradation of BCR-ABL is critical for the induction of the antileukemic effects of As(2)O(3) and raise the potential for future therapeutic approaches to target BCR-ABL expressing cells by modulating elements of the autophagic machinery to promote BCR-ABL degradation.
We recently identified a missense variant (Glu298Asp) that lies within exon 7 of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene, and that is associated with severe preeclampsia (proteinuric hypertension that develops as a consequence of pregnancy). Maternal hypertension is the most consistently identified factor predisposing to placental abruption. Our objective, therefore, was to analyze the association between the Glu298Asp eNOS gene variant and placental abruption. The study participants included 35 patients with histories of placental abruption and 170 control subjects. Screening for the Glu298Asp eNOS gene variant was carried out by analysis of polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. The analyses revealed that the frequency of the Glu298Asp variant (Glu298Asp homozygotes and heterozygotes) was significantly (P<0.001) higher in the placental abruption group (n=14; 40%) than in the control group (n=24; 14%). We conclude that the presence of the Glu298Asp eNOS gene variant could be a marker of increased risk of developing placental abruption.
Overgrowth disorders are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by increased growth parameters and other variable clinical features such as intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism. To identify new causes of human overgrowth, we performed exome sequencing in ten proband-parent trios and detected two de novo DNMT3A mutations. We identified 11 additional de novo mutations by sequencing DNMT3A in a further 142 individuals with overgrowth. The mutations alter residues in functional DNMT3A domains, and protein modeling suggests that they interfere with domain-domain interactions and histone binding. Similar mutations were not present in 1,000 UK population controls (13/152 cases versus 0/1,000 controls; P < 0.0001). Mutation carriers had a distinctive facial appearance, intellectual disability and greater height. DNMT3A encodes a DNA methyltransferase essential for establishing methylation during embryogenesis and is commonly somatically mutated in acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, DNMT3A joins an emerging group of epigenetic DNA- and histone-modifying genes associated with both developmental growth disorders and hematological malignancies.
Formaldehyde (FA) is an environmental and occupational pollutant, and its toxic effects on the immune system have been shown. Nevertheless, no data are available regarding the programming mechanisms after FA exposure and its repercussions for the immune systems of offspring. In this study, our objective was to investigate the effects of low-dose exposure of FA on pregnant rats and its repercussion for the development of allergic lung inflammation in offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned in 3 groups: P (rats exposed to FA (0.75 ppm, 1 h/day, 5 days/week, for 21 days)), C (rats exposed to vehicle of FA (distillated water)) and B (rats non-manipulated). After 30 days of age, the offspring was sensitised with ovalbumin (OVA)-alum and challenged with aerosolized OVA (1%, 15 min, 3 days). After 24 h the OVA challenge the parameters were evaluated. Our data showed that low-dose exposure to FA during pregnancy induced low birth weight and suppressed the development of allergic lung inflammation and tracheal hyperresponsiveness in offspring by mechanisms mediated by reduced anaphylactic antibodies synthesis, IL-6 and TNF-alpha secretion. Elevated levels of IL-10 were found. Any systemic alteration was detected in the exposed pregnant rats, although oxidative stress in the uterine environment was evident at the moment of the delivery based on elevated COX-1 expression and reduced cNOS and SOD-2 in the uterus. Therefore, we show the putative programming mechanisms induced by FA on the immune system for the first time and the mechanisms involved may be related to oxidative stress in the foetal microenvironment.
Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant widely prescribed because of its broad spectrum of activity. While acute toxicity from high doses is well recognized, there have been few animal studies of its chronic toxicity at therapeutic dose levels. Sodium valproate given continuously in drinking fluid (600 mg/l) throughout pregnancy and lactation to breeding gerbils caused developmental delay of the self-righting reflex in their pups. Dams ingested 97 mg/kg daily during gestation and 151 mg/kg on average during lactation, a dose in the lower range of anticonvulsant effectiveness. Reproductive performance, birth weights and subsequent growth of the pups remained normal, as did brain weights in adulthood. Drug-treated offspring, continuing to receive valproate as drinking fluid after weaning (600 mg/l; 82 to 111 mg/kg) showed negligible behavioural alteration at 6 weeks of age as assessed by ethological procedures, although behavioural change did occur at 20 weeks in the female animals. These females were characterised by significant enhancement of exploration and scanning during dyadic encounters in an unfamiliar cage, and showed a concomitant reduction of other nonsocial activities. Short-term administration of this dose of the drug did not affect behaviour. These results suggest an increased reactivity to the environment which becomes evident only after long-term treatment with valproate and to which female animals are more susceptible than males. These findings of developmental delay and of modifications to behaviour later in life points to the need for more detailed clinical assessments of the effects of valproate in human patients.
Severe cocaine toxicity causes acidemia and cardiac dysfunction. These manifestations are described in 4 patients who presented with seizures, psychomotor agitation, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Their initial laboratory values demonstrated acidemia and electrocardiographic findings that included a prolonged QRS complex and QTc duration and a rightward T40 ms axis deviation. Treatment of the patients with hyperventilation, sedation, active cooling, and sodium bicarbonate infusion led to the normalization of their blood pHs and reversal of their cardiac conduction disorders. Acidemia can contribute to cocaine cardiac disorders by promoting conduction delays, dysrhythmias, and depressed myocardial contractility. Good supportive care corrects the blood pH and cardiac conduction disorders and remains the major focus in the management of patients with cocaine toxicity.
Atherosclerosis preferentially occurs in areas of turbulent flow and low fluid shear stress, while laminar flow and high shear stress are atheroprotective. Well characterized atheroprotective mechanisms include inhibition of thrombosis (increased tissue-type plasminogen activator and decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis, limitation of permeability (uptake of low-density lipoprotein), prevention of white blood cell binding and transmigration (no expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1] and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1] and no release of monocyte chemotactic protein-1) and increased bioavailability of nitric oxide (because of increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and manganese superoxide dismutase). Our lab has investigated flow-mediated inhibition of inflammatory cytokine action. In particular, we have shown that flow prevents tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mediated signal transduction. TNF regulates inflammatory gene expression (e.g., ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) in endothelial cells, in part, by stimulating mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases that phosphorylate transcription factors. We hypothesized that fluid shear stress inhibits TNF inflammatory effects on endothelial cells by inhibiting TNF mediated activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of steady laminar flow on TNF-stimulated activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The results show that flow inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation through multiple mechanisms, including stimulation of counter-regulatory MAP kinases (extracellular signal regulated kinases [ERK]1/2 and ERK5) and inhibition of apoptosis signal-regulated kinase. In summary, the atheroprotective effects of steady laminar flow on the endothelium involve multiple synergistic mechanisms. These multiple mechanisms offer attractive targets for new drug therapies aimed at limiting atherosclerosis development and progression. (c) 2002 Prous Science. All rights reserved.
Successful chemotherapy for patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) has been limited by a lack of active drugs. The most effective single agents are doxorubicin, dacarbazine, and, more recently, ifosfamide. Previously the most widely used combination has been CYVADIC (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine). In one randomized trial, ifosfamide was superior to cyclophosphamide; two nonrandomized studies also reported favorable results. Etoposide monotherapy was successful in 8%; the effectiveness of cisplatin was 5-23%. In view of these findings, the authors treated STS patients with an etoposide, cisplatin, and ifosfamide (VIP) combination.
The eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed, inoperable, metastatic or locally recurrent STS; a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0-2; a maximum age of 75 years; and progressive, measurable disease. A total of 104 patients were treated from January 1990 to June 1997. The median age of the patients was 42.4 years. The patients were treated with a combination of etoposide (100mg/m(2) for 5 days), ifosfamide (2000 mg/m(2) for 2 days), and cisplatin (20mg/m(2) for 5 days) once a month via a peripheral vein. The treatment response and the toxicity were assessed according to WHO criteria.
Of 104 evaluable patients, 47 responded. The overall response rate was 46% (complete response: 10%; partial response: 36%). In 43 patients the disease remained stable (41%). Remission duration was 4.6 months. Toxicity was moderate. The main adverse events were alopecia (100%), nausea and vomiting (73%), and leukopenia (29%).
This new combination is promising for the treatment of patients with advanced STS.
In December 2001, the FDA required a "black box warning" suggesting that unexpected cardiovascular deaths could occur at normal therapeutic doses of droperidol. We reviewed data from 270 MedWatch reports, including 99 reports of death, submitted between November 1, 1997, and January 10, 2002. We further reviewed primary reports of deaths and cardiovascular adverse events associated with < or = 10 mg of droperidol. There were 99 death reports representing 89 patients, with a specified dose in 66 cases. Among 74 (83%) foreign fatality reports, 57 included a known dose (> or = 50 mg in 29 cases [49%] and < or = 2.5 mg in only 3 cases [5%]). Of the 15 (17%) U.S. cases, 9 included a specified dose (< or = 2.5 mg in 5 cases and 5-10 mg in 4 cases). Cardiovascular deaths after therapeutic doses (< or = 2.5 mg) of droperidol are rare. Mandatory electrocardiographic screening appears unnecessary.
Headache is the most prominent side effect of nitrate therapy. Lack of compliance is usually associated with headache which has a detrimental effect on quality of life. In spite of the high frequency of this adverse effect, the headache characteristics, timing and risk factors are less known. On the other hand, intravenously administered nitroglycerin-induced migraine attack is a common human research model in migraine. AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY: to evaluate the headaches occurring after administration of therapeutic dose of sublingual nitroglycerin, in migraineurs and controls.
Twenty-eight female migraine patients without aura and 14 healthy controls received 0.5 mg nitroglycerin. Headache intensity and characteristics have been investigated for 24 hours.
two types of headache developed after the nitroglycerin administration: (1) an immediate headache that does not fulfil the criteria for migraine, mild and disappears spontaneously within 1 hour; (2) a typical migraine attack without aura develops several hours after the nitroglycerin administration (mean latency: 250 min), moderate or severe, and warrants antimigraine therapy. The two types of headache developed independently. The nitroglycerin-induced headaches have not been determined solely by the previous migraine diagnosis, although both immediate (p = 0.0045) and typical migraine headache (p = 0.00047) were significantly more frequent among migraineurs compared to controls. Moreover, those control subjects who experienced migraine attacks had predispositions to migraine. Previous results of the authors supported that lower platelet serotonin concentration and higher plasma CGRP concentration, during the headache free period, are risk factors that express greater susceptibility to develop both spontaneous and nitroglycerin-induced migraine attack.
Authors suggest an accurate exploration of the headache case-history before nitroglycerin treatment. This makes it possible to give proper information to migraine patients and possible migraine patients, and thus suitable treatment can be offered if needed.
Styrene is one of the most important industrial intermediates consumed in the world and is mainly used as a monomer for reinforced plastics and rubber. Styrene has been found to be hepatotoxic and pneumotoxic in humans and experimental animals. The toxicity of styrene is suggested to be metabolism-dependent. Styrene-7,8-oxide has been considered as the major metabolite responsible for styrene-induced cytotoxicity. The objective of the study was to investigate the correlation between cytotoxicity of styrene and chemical and biochemical properties of the vinyl group of styrene by development of structure activity relationships (SAR). 4-Fluorostyrene, 4-chlorostyrene and 4-bromostyrene were selected for the SAR study. Cytotoxicity of styrene and the halogenated styrene derivatives with an order of 4-bromostyrene>4-chlorostyrene>4-fluorostyrene≈styrene was observed in CYP2E1 transgenic cells. Similar orders in the efficiency of the metabolism of styrene and the halogenated styrene analogues to their oxides and in the electrophilicity of the corresponding oxides were observed. Additionally, the order of the potency of cellular glutathione depletion and the degree of protein adduction induced by styrene and the halogenated styrenes were consistent with that of their cytotoxicities. The wild-type cells were less susceptible to the toxicity of the corresponding model compounds than CYP2E1 cells. The present study provided insight into the roles of the biochemical and chemical properties of styrene in its cytotoxicity.
Cancer patients treated with antimitotic drugs in the taxane and vinca alkaloid classes sometimes develop a chronic painful peripheral neuropathy whose cause is not understood. In animal models of painful peripheral neuropathy due to nerve trauma or diabetes there is obvious axonal degeneration accompanied by an abnormal incidence of spontaneous discharge in A-fiber and C-fiber nociceptors. But animals with paclitaxel- and vincristine-evoked neuropathic pain do not have axonal degeneration at the level of the peripheral nerve. However, recent data show that they do have a partial degeneration of the primary afferent neurons' terminal arbors in the epidermis. It is not clear as to whether this relatively minor degeneration is accompanied by abnormal spontaneous discharge. We surveyed primary afferent axonal activity in the sural nerve of rats with the paclitaxel- and vincristine-evoked pain syndromes at the time of peak pain severity. Compared to vehicle-injected controls, we find a significant increase in spontaneously discharging A-fibers and C-fibers. Moreover, we show that prophylactic treatment with acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC), which blocks the development of the paclitaxel-evoked pain, causes a significant decrease (ca. 50%) in the incidence of A-fibers and C-fibers with spontaneous discharge. These results suggest that abnormal spontaneous afferent discharge is likely to be a factor in the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy, and that the therapeutic effects of ALC may be due to the suppression of this discharge.
We previously showed that the anti-inflammatory drug, sulfasalazine (salicylazosulfapyridine, SASP), can arrest proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells by inhibiting uptake of cystine via the x(c-) cystine/glutamate antiporter. Here we examined SASP with regard to reduction of cellular glutathione (GSH) levels and drug efficacy-enhancing ability.
GSH levels were measured spectrophotometrically. Cellular drug retention was determined with 3H-labeled methotrexate, and drug efficacy with a colony formation assay.
Incubation of the mammary cancer cells with SASP (0.3-0.5 mM) led to reduction of their GSH content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Similar to MK-571, a multidrug resistance-associated protein inhibitor, SASP increased intracellular accumulation of methotrexate. Preincubation of cells with SASP (0.3 mM) significantly enhanced the potency of the anticancer agent doxorubicin (2.5 nM).
SASP-induced reduction of cellular GSH levels can lead to growth arrest of mammary cancer cells and enhancement of anticancer drug efficacy.
We performed a population-based study of over 100,000 users of diclofenac, naproxen, or piroxicam to identify cases of important blood, skin, central nervous system, kidney, pancreas, or pulmonary disorders caused by these drugs. In three cases a causal relation seemed likely; one of hemolytic anemia attributed to diclofenac, one of neutropenia attributed to naproxen, and one of pancreatitis attributed to piroxicam. In 13 additional cases a causal connection seemed unlikely but could not be fully ruled out. We conclude that such illnesses are uncommonly caused by the three agents studied.
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of the end-stage failure of kidney, but the efficacy of currently available strategies for the prevention of DN remains poor. An activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), has been suggested to be a key step in the pathogenesis of DN. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), an aqueous extract from the Astragalus membranaceus roots, on gene expressions of NF-kappaB and an inhibitory protein of nuclear factor-kappaB (IkappaB) in experimental DN induced by streptozotocin in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
Rats with DN were treated with APS (1g/kg p.o.) or benazepril (1.5mg/kg p.o.), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, using as positive control. The biochemical parameters such as blood glucose, plasma lipid and microalbuminuria were measured. Also, the mRNA level of NF-kappaB or IkappaB in renal cortex was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
Eight weeks after the treatment, symptoms including shineless, bristly hair, polyuria, polydipsia, lethargy, physical inactivity, loss of body weight, kyphosis and decubitus position were ameliorated by APS. The levels of blood glucose, plasma lipid and microalbuminuria were lowered in APS-treated rats compared with control rats. The ratio of kidney weight over body weight was reduced and the renal function was improved after APS treatment. The mRNA level of NF-kappaB in renal cortex was decreased and IkappaB mRNA expression was raised by APS. These results suggest that APS has prophylactic and therapeutic effects on the progress of DN;
therefore, APS is helpful for the prevention and/or treatment of DN at early stage.
Theophylline not only dilates the bronchi, but also modulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibits inflammation. Theophylline exerts an antiinflammatory effect on allergic inflammation through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation in mast cells. However, the action of theophylline on monocytes/macrophages and T cells is unknown.
We examined whether or not theophylline inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB, a factor that is essential for the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, in human monocytic U-937 cells, a T cell line (Jurkat) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The inhibitory effect of theophylline on TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation was evaluated by Western blotting, flow cytometry and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assaying. Expression of the IkappaBalpha protein was evaluated by Western blotting.
Western blotting demonstrated that theophylline inhibits NF-kappaB activation in U-937 and Jurkat cells and PBMC. Flow cytometry demonstrated that theophylline inhibits NF-kappaB activation in U-937 and Jurkat cells in a dose-related manner. CAT assaying indicated that NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression is inhibited in U-937 cells pretreated with theophylline. Western blotting of cytoplasmic extracts of U-937 cells revealed that this inhibition was linked to theophylline-induced preservation of expression of the IkappaBalpha protein.
These findings are consistent with the idea that theophylline suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines via inhibition of NF-kappaB activation through preservation of the IkappaBalpha protein in monocytes/macrophages and T cells.
N-Acetylcysteine, theophylline, and other agents have shown inconsistent results in reducing contrast-induced nephropathy.
To determine the effect of these agents on preventing nephropathy.
Relevant randomized, controlled trials were identified by computerized searches in MEDLINE (from 1966 through 3 November 2006), EMBASE (1980 through November 2006), PubMed, Web of Knowledge (Current Contents Connect, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, and ISI Proceedings for the latest 5 years), and the Cochrane Library databases (up to November 2006). Databases were searched for studies in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.
Randomized, controlled trials that administered N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, fenoldopam, dopamine, iloprost, statin, furosemide, or mannitol to a treatment group; used intravenous iodinated contrast; defined contrast-induced nephropathy explicitly; and reported sufficient data to construct a 2 x 2 table of the primary effect measure.
Abstracted information included patient characteristics, type of contrast media and dose, periprocedural hydration, definition of contrast-induced nephropathy, and prophylactic agent dose and route.
In the 41 studies included, N-acetylcysteine (relative risk, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.88]) and theophylline (relative risk, 0.49 [CI, 0.23 to 1.06]) reduced the risk for contrast-induced nephropathy more than saline alone, whereas furosemide increased it (relative risk, 3.27 [CI, 1.48 to 7.26]). The remaining agents did not significantly affect risk. Significant subgroup heterogeneity was present only for N-acetylcysteine. No publication bias was discerned.
All trials evaluated the surrogate end point of contrast-induced nephropathy as the primary outcome. The lack of a statistically significant renoprotective effect of theophylline may result from insufficient data or study heterogeneity. True study quality remains uncertain.
N-acetylcysteine is more renoprotective than hydration alone. Theophylline may also reduce risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, although the detected association was not significant. Our data support the administration of N-acetylcysteine prophylaxis, particularly in high-risk patients, given its low cost, availability, and few side effects.
Sural nerve changes are described in 2 cases of amiodarone neuropathy. Clinically, 1 patient developed a sensorimotor neuropathy, whereas in the other it was predominantly motor. Examination of sural nerves showed demyelination with only mild axonal loss. Cytoplasmic changes developed in Schwann cells of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, and involved loss of most recognizable organelles. These changes were associated with, and possibly preceded, myelin sheath breakdown. Inclusions, mainly of a lamellated type, were found in all cell types in the nerves. These inclusions, known to be lysosomal in origin, are a characteristic finding in amiodarone-induced neuropathy. The pathogenesis of the neuropathy is discussed, with particular reference to the findings in a parallel experimental study.
