Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a fatal neoplasm with no acceptable curative approaches. We used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to compare the gene expression pattern of a surgically resected MPM to the autologous normal mesothelium. Intelectin gene overexpression (>139-fold) was found in the tumor. Online SAGE datasets revealed intelectin to be consistently present in mesothelioma(s), ovarian cancer, and colon cancer. Intelectin mRNA expression was found by RT-PCR in 4 of 5 resected MPM tumors, and Intelectin protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in 28 of 53 MPM tumors, and in 4 of 4 mesothelioma cell lines studied by Western blot. A marked induction in intelectin gene expression was observed among human primary mesothelial cells as a consequence of crocidolite asbestos exposure and simian virus 40 infection. Intelectin overexpression in mesothelioma could have potential screening, and therapeutic implications.
The aim of the study was to examine antidotal potency of trimedoxime in mice poisoned with three direct dimethoxy-substituted organophosphorus inhibitors. In order to assess the protective efficacy of trimedoxime against dichlorvos, heptenophos or monocrotophos, median effective doses and efficacy half-times were calculated. Trimedoxime (24 mg/kg intravenously) was injected 5 min. before 1.3 LD50 intravenously of poisons. Activities of brain, diaphragmal and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase, as well as of plasma carboxylesterases were determined at different time intervals (10, 40 and 60 min.) after administration of the antidotes. Protective effect of trimedoxime decreased according to the following order: monocrotophos > heptenophos > dichlorvos. Administration of the oxime produced a significant reactivation of central and peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibited with dichlorvos and heptenophos, with the exception of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase inhibited by heptenophos. Surprisingly, trimedoxime did not induce reactivation of monocrotophos-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in any of the tissues tested. These organophosphorus compounds produced a significant inhibition of plasma carboxylesterase activity, while administration of trimedoxime led to regeneration of the enzyme activity. The same dose of trimedoxime assured survival of experimental animals poisoned by all three organophosphorus compounds, although the biochemical findings were quite different.
Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) is a metabolite of morphine and a micro-opioid agonist. To quantify the potency and speed of onset-offset of M6G and explore putative sex dependency, the authors studied the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M6G in volunteers using a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study design.
Ten men and 10 women received 0.3 mg/kg intravenous M6G and placebo (two thirds of the dose as bolus, one third as a continuous infusion over 1 h) on separate occasions. For 7 h, pain tolerance was measured using gradually increasing transcutaneous electrical stimulation, and blood samples were obtained. A population pharmacokinetic (inhibitory sigmoid Emax)-pharmacodynamic analysis was used to analyze M6G-induced changes in tolerated stimulus intensity. The improvement in model fits by inclusion of covariate sex was tested for significance. P values less than 0.01 were considered significant. Taking into account previous morphine data, a predictive pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was constructed to determine the contribution of M6G to morphine analgesia.
M6G concentrations did not differ between men and women. M6G caused analgesia significantly greater than that observed with placebo (P < 0.01). The M6G analgesia data were well described by the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. The M6G effect site concentration causing a 25% increase in current (C25) was 275 +/- 135 nm (population estimate +/- SE), the blood effect site equilibration half-life was 6.2 +/- 3.3 h, and the steepness parameter was 0.71 +/- 0.18. Intersubject variability was 167% for C25 and 218% for the effect half-life. None of the model parameters showed sex dependency.
A cumulative dose of 0.3 mg/kg M6G, given over 1 h, produces long-term analgesia greater than that observed with placebo, with equal dynamics (potency and speed of onset-offset) in men and women. Possible causes for the great intersubject response variability, such as genetic polymorphism of the micro-opioid receptor and placebo-related phenomena, are discussed. The predictive pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was applied successfully and was used to estimate M6G analgesia after morphine in patients with normal and impaired renal function.
A 59-year-old male in a state of confusion following cerebral angiography with iopamidol was reported. He was admitted to our hospital for right upper monoparesis. MRI demonstrated multiple cerebral infarction. The patient had undergone angiographies with iopamidol, of which a total of 100 ml had been used. After the examination, the patient showed perseveration, continuing to say the same sentence and 30 minutes later he entered a state of confusion. He recovered completely from this consciousness disturbance after 30 hours. No lesion except for the old infarction was demonstrated on CT and MRI. Confusion in this case was assumed to be a toxic reaction caused by the contrast agent.
Cholestasis is associated with vascular changes and in previous studies decreased response of visceral vessels of cholestatic animals to phenylephrine and acetylcholine has been shown. In the present study, the response of mesenteric vascular bed of cholestatic rats to clonidine (an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist) was investigated and we also examined the role of endogenous opioids and nitric oxide (NO). Seven-day ligation of bile duct was used as the model to study cholestasis. Six groups of rats, each of which divided into two subgroups (bile duct-ligated and sham-operated), were examined. Three groups of animals were chronically treated with either normal saline, naltrexone (an opioid receptor antagonist, 20 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or aminoguanidine (a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 150 mg/kg/day, s.c.) for 7 days. After 7 days the response of the mesenteric vascular bed to subsequent doses of clonidine was studied. In other two groups, 7 days after the operation, the response of the mesenteric vascular bed to clonidine in the presence of either yuhimbine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, or N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, was studied. In the last group, vasodilation response to sodium nitroprusside (an endothelium-independent vasorelaxant) was evaluated. Clonidine caused vasodilation in a dose-dependent manner by acting on endothelial alpha2-adrenoceptors since its effect was antagonized by yohimbine, and this vasodilation was through the L-arginine pathway since there was no response in the presence of L-NAME in the perfusate. Compared to sham-operated rats, there was a significant right shift in the clonidine concentration curves of cholestatic animals. Maximum response in cholestatic rats was significantly lower comparing to the sham group (P<0.01) and the dose of clonidine that causes 50% of maximum response (ED50) was significantly higher in cholestatic rats (P<0.05). Vasodilation response to sodium nitroprusside was the same in cholestatic and sham-operated rats. Seven-day treatment with aminoguanidine recovered the effect of cholestasis. Seven-day treatment with naltrexone caused an increase in maximum response (P<0.01) and a decrease in ED50 (P<0.05) in cholestatic rats, while this treatment in sham-operated rats caused a decrease in the maximum response (P<0.01) and an increase in ED50 (P<0.05). This study showed that cholestasis is associated with decreased responsiveness of mesenteric vascular bed to clonidine and the cholestasis-associated NO overproduction and increased level of endogenous opioids may contribute to this process.
Nitric oxide-donating acetylsalicylic acid (NO-ASA) has been shown to possess an antineoplastic effect in Wnt-/β-catenin-active cancers. As chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells exhibit aberrantly active Wnt signaling, we investigated the effect of the para-isomer of NO-ASA on CLL cell survival in vitro and in a CLL-like xenograft mouse model.
Apoptosis in primary CLL cells was determined by flow cytometric annexin V-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)/PI (propidium iodide) staining and immunoblotting of caspases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and antiapoptotic proteins. Interference of NO-ASA with Wnt/β-catenin signaling was analyzed through immunoblots of different pathway members. Influence of caspase activation was investigated by pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor. CLL-like JVM3 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into irradiated nude mice that were treated with 100 mg of para-NO-ASA/kg of body weight p.o. (by mouth) for 21 days.
para-NO-ASA induced apoptosis in CLL cells with an LC(50) (lethal concentration) of 8.72 + 0.04 μmol/L, whereas healthy blood cells were not affected. Furthermore, the compound induced caspase 9, caspase 3, and PARP cleavage. In addition, cleavage of β-catenin and downregulation of β-catenin/lymphoid enhancer factor (Lef)-1 targets was observed. para-NO-ASA demonstrated strong antitumor efficacy in the xenograft mouse model with a tumor inhibtion rate of 83.4%. During therapy, no gross toxicity could be observed.
para-NO-ASA selectively induces apoptosis in primary CLL cells and efficiently reduces tumor growth in a CLL-like xenograft model. As NO-ASA is orally available and is generally well tolerated, para-NO-ASA might be a promising new compound for CLL therapy.
We present a patient with sotalol-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that was seen only with programmed ventricular stimulation. Electrophysiologic studies performed prior to initiation of sotalol therapy revealed inducible monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Possible underlying electrophysiologic mechanisms are discussed.
Bortezomib is a novel proteasome inhibitor with significant antimyeloma activity. Its toxicity is manageable, and the most frequent adverse effects mainly consist of gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, neuropatic pain, and thrombocytopenia. Severe liver toxicity has not been previously recognized. A patient with relapsed multiple myeloma who developed bortezomib-induced severe recurrent hepatitis is described. The importance of recognizing this rare potential toxicity is highlighted in order to discontinue this agent if liver adverse reaction is suspected.
Four cases are reported in which respiratory arrest occured coincident with the intravenous administration of large doses of trimethaphan camsylate (Arfonad) to control hypertension. The mechanism of the respiratory depression is unknown, but it may have been related to a direct effect of trimethaphan on the respiratory center or to a curare-like effect of the drug. Close monitoring of ventilatory capacity should be maintained in all patients treated with trimethaphan.
The toxicity of Riddell groundsel (Senecio riddellii) gavaged to calves at a known lethal rate was compared with the toxicity of riddelliine and riddelliine N-oxide, the pyrrolizidine alkaloids isolated from the plant, which were fed by intraruminal infusion. Doses of the alkaloids were adjusted to the amount determined to be in the plant and fed individually and in combination. The relative toxicosis in the calves was measured by clinical signs, serum enzyme changes, survival time to morbidity, and histologic changes. Calves fed Senecio riddellii by gavage for 20 consecutive days to provide 45 mg of total pyrrolizidine alkaloids/kg of body weight/d developed clinical signs and serum enzyme changes typical of seneciosis, with 100% morbidity. However, calves receiving riddelliine at 4.5 mg/kg/d for 20 days had neither serum enzyme changes nor clinical signs of pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis. Calves treated with riddelliine N-oxide (40.5 mg/kg/d), and with riddelliine (4.5 mg/kg/d) and riddelliine N-oxide (40.5 mg/kg/d) in combination, had 100% morbidity, although the latter group had fewer liver lesions. These results establish that the N-oxide form of the alkaloid alone is capable of inducing typical Senecio toxicosis in cattle and that the free base level of the plant cannot be considered to be the sole factor in assessing the toxicity of S riddellii.
To address the multiplicity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with particular interest in its local, synergistic regulation, we investigate dynamic changes of the RAS and associated systems in response to external stimuli in the rat. We tested influences of the RAS blockade (candesartan and enalapril), diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), high lipid diet, and salt loading on tissue mRNA level of 12 principal genes. Under the hemodynamic conditions appropriately predetermined, we quantitatively evaluated mRNA level changes with and without each intervention in five organs-the brain, heart, kidney, liver, and adipose tissues-of male rats (n = 5 each). A total of 250 tissues were examined by real-time PCR. Significant changes in mRNA level (P < 0.05) were found in a drug-, diet- and tissue-specific manner. For instance, 29% of genes (14 out of 48 tissues showing detectable mRNA levels) were differentially regulated by candesartan and enalapril, although both drugs reduced blood pressure to similar extents. When the overall interactions among 12 genes were compared between interventions, the RAS and associated systems appeared to change in the opposite direction between candesartan and high lipid diet in the adipose tissue and between candesartan and salt loading in the heart. Enalapril, however, induced unique patterns of perturbation in the local RAS under the corresponding conditions. Thus, this study provides a fundamental picture of gene expression profile in vivo in the RAS and associated systems. In particular, our data highlight differential regulation between candesartan and enalapril, which may reflect the individual pharmacological properties regarding clinical implications.
Tamoxifen is one of the most commonly used anticancer medications. Hepatic damage secondary to tamoxifen treatment is rare. Tamoxifen-induced multifocal hepatic fatty infiltration has not been reported previously. This report describes one case of steatohepatitis caused by tamoxifen in an elderly woman with a history of breast cancer. The patient had multifocal hepatic fatty infiltration secondary to tamoxifen therapy. After tamoxifen was discontinued, the features of multifocal hepatic fatty infiltration on CT improved dramatically, and hepatic transaminases normalized.
Several therapeutic substances can cause torsades de pointes, especially if they prolong the QT interval and/or if there is an associated hypokalaemia. Certain second generation H1 antihistamines have been incriminated in the occurrence of such ventricular arrhythmias, such as terfenadine and astezimole, which have been withdrawn. Cetirizine, widely used in the treatment of allergic reactions, is a second generation H1 antihistamine with as yet no precautions of use regarding rhythm disturbances. No documented case of arrhythmia attributable to this drug has been reported. We report the case of a dialysed patient with chronic renal failure who had symptomatic episodes of torsades de pointes in the context of hypokalaemia and cetirizine overdose. In the light of this observation it would appear that the prescription of cetirizine is contra-indicated under such conditions.
The antiplatelet drug cilostazol is efficacious for prevention of stroke recurrence compared with placebo. We designed the second Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study (CSPS 2) to establish non-inferiority of cilostazol versus aspirin for prevention of stroke, and to compare the efficacy and safety of cilostazol and aspirin in patients with non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke.
Patients aged 20-79 years who had had a cerebral infarction within the previous 26 weeks were enrolled at 278 sites in Japan and allocated to receive 100 mg cilostazol twice daily or 81 mg aspirin once daily for 1-5 years. Patients were allocated according to a computer-generated randomisation sequence by means of a dynamic balancing method using patient information obtained at registration. All patients, study personnel, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of stroke (cerebral infarction, cerebral haemorrhage, or subarachnoid haemorrhage). The predefined margin of non-inferiority was an upper 95% CI limit for the hazard ratio of 1·33. Analyses were by full-analysis set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00234065.
Between December, 2003, and October, 2006, 2757 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive cilostazol (n=1379) or aspirin (n=1378), of whom 1337 on cilostazol and 1335 on aspirin were included in analyses; mean follow-up was 29 months (SD 16). The primary endpoint occurred at yearly rates of 2·76% (n=82) in the cilostazol group and 3·71% (n=119) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio 0·743, 95% CI 0·564-0·981; p=0·0357). Haemorrhagic events (cerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or haemorrhage requiring hospital admission) occurred in fewer patients on cilostazol (0·77%, n=23) than on aspirin (1·78%, n=57; 0·458, 0·296-0·711; p=0·0004), but headache, diarrhoea, palpitation, dizziness, and tachycardia were more frequent in the cilostazol group than in the aspirin group.
Cilostazol seems to be non-inferior, and might be superior, to aspirin for prevention of stroke after an ischaemic stroke, and was associated with fewer haemorrhagic events. Therefore, cilostazol could be used for prevention of stroke in patients with non-cardioembolic stroke.

Cardiac disease is a significant complication of childhood oncologic therapy. We report the case of a 14-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia who developed symptomatic cardiomyopathy only 4 months into treatment with a combination of daunomycin and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Despite cessation of daunomycin, she demonstrated fluctuating systolic function in relation to ATRA administration. Improvement and deterioration in systolic function on echocardiogram and serum B-natriuretic peptide levels were seen while receiving ATRA 1 week on and 1 week off, respectively, during the maintenance phase of therapy.
To compare the effect of bimatoprost and the fixed combination of latanoprost and timolol (LTFC) on 24-hour mean intraocular pressure (IOP) after patients are switched from a nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol.
Randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial.
Two hundred patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
Included were patients who were controlled (IOP < 21 mmHg) on the nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol for at least 3 months before the baseline visit or patients on monotherapy with either latanoprost or timolol who were eligible for dual therapy not being fully controlled on monotherapy. The latter group of patients underwent a 6-week wash-in phase with the nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol before baseline IOP determination and study inclusion. Supine and sitting position IOPs were recorded at 8 pm, midnight, 5 am, 8 am, noon, and 4 pm at baseline, week 6, and week 12 visits.
An analysis of covariance model was used for a noninferiority test of the primary efficacy variable, with mean area under the 24-hour IOP curve after 12 weeks of treatment as response variable and treatment, center, and baseline IOP as factors. A secondary analysis was performed on the within-treatment change from baseline.
Mean baseline IOPs were 16.3+/-3.3 mmHg and 15.5+/-2.9.mmHg in the bimatoprost and LTFC groups, respectively. At week 12, mean IOPs were 16.1+/-2.5 mmHg for the bimatoprost group and 16.3+/-3.7 mmHg for the LTFC group, and no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups could be found. As compared with baseline, mean IOP increased by 0.3+/-3.6 mmHg during the day and decreased by 0.8+/-3.8 mmHg during the night in the bimatoprost group, whereas there were increases of 1.43+/-2.6 mmHg and 0.14+/-3.2 mmHg in the LTFC group, respectively.
Bimatoprost is not inferior to the LTFC in maintaining IOP at a controlled level during a 24-hour period in patients switched from the nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol.
Effects of d-limonene on alpha 2u-globulin in the kidneys, urine and serum were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting analysis. Treatment of male rats with d-limonene by gavage for 14 consecutive days (300 mg/kg/day) caused accumulation of hyaline droplets in renal proximal tubule cells, and a marked intensification of a protein band corresponding to the kidney-type alpha 2u-globulin, with a molecular weight calculated to be approximately 16 kDa. However, no significant changes in the serum alpha 2u-globulin (native-type) band, of approximately 19 kDa, were observed between treated rats and controls, suggesting that circulating alpha 2u-globulin levels were not affected by the d-limonene administration. While the molecular weight of the major alpha 2u-globulin in the urine from control rats was the same as that in the serum (native-type), marked increase in the protein band corresponding to kidney-type-alpha 2u-globulin was observed in the urine from treated rats. The results were indicative of elimination of alpha 2u-globulin from the kidney to urine, the appearance of kidney-type-alpha 2u-globulin in urine implying disruption or exfoliation of proximal tubule cells. Therefore, it is suggested that the presence of the alpha 2u-globulin (kidney-type) in the urine might be used as an indicator of chemically induced alpha 2u-globulin nephropathy.
Neurologic deficits after apparent intrathecal injection of 3% Nesacaine-CE intended for epidural administration created concern about the potential toxicity of chloroprocaine and the preservative sodium bisulfite. Although bisulfite-free formulations of chloroprocaine were subsequently introduced into clinical practice, the relative toxicities of this anesthetic and preservative were never clearly established. The current studies used a relevant functional and histologic model to investigate the intrathecal neurotoxicity of these two compounds.
In the first experiment, rats implanted with intrathecal catheters were given one of two commercially available solutions of chloroprocaine, one of which contained sodium bisulfite; control animals received saline. Animals were assessed for sensory impairment 7 days after administration using the tail-flick test and were killed to obtain histologic specimens to quantify nerve injury. In the second experiment, identical methodology was used to investigate the effects of freshly prepared solutions of chloroprocaine, chloroprocaine with sodium bisulfite, sodium bisulfite, and saline.
The two experiments yielded similar results. In experiment 1, tail-flick latencies and nerve injury scores after administration of plain chloroprocaine were significantly greater than those of chloroprocaine containing bisulfite. Injury scores for animals receiving chloroprocaine with bisulfite were elevated compared with those for animals given saline. In experiment 2, animals receiving plain chloroprocaine developed elevations in tail-flick latencies and nerve injury scores that were significantly greater than those for all other groups. Nerve injury scores with chloroprocaine containing bisulfite were greater than with saline or bisulfite alone. Tail-flick latencies and nerve injury scores with bisulfite alone were similar to those with saline.
Clinical deficits associated with unintentional intrathecal injection of chloroprocaine likely resulted from a direct effect of the anesthetic, not the preservative. The data also suggest that bisulfite can reduce neurotoxic damage induced by intrathecal local anesthetic.
We previously reported eight patients who developed Churg-Strauss syndrome in association with zafirlukast treatment for asthma and postulated that the syndrome resulted from unmasking of a previously existing condition due to corticosteroid withdrawal and not from a direct drug effect. The availability of montelukast, a new leukotriene receptor antagonist with a different molecular structure, permitted us to test this hypothesis. Our goals were to ascertain whether the Churg-Strauss syndrome developed in patients taking montelukast and other novel asthma medications, and to describe potential mechanisms for the syndrome.
Case series.
Outpatient and hospital practices of pulmonologists in the United States and Belgium.
Four adults (one man, three women) who received montelukast as treatment for asthma; two women who received salmeterol/fluticasone therapy, but not montelukast.
Churg-Strauss syndrome developed in the four asthmatic patients who received montelukast. In each case, there was a long history of difficult-to-control asthma characterized by multiple exacerbations that had required frequent courses of oral systemic corticosteroids or high doses of inhaled corticosteroids for control. Two other asthmatics who received fluticasone and salmeterol but not montelukast therapy developed the same syndrome with tapering doses of oral or high doses of inhaled corticosteroids.
The occurrence of Churg-Strauss syndrome in asthmatic patients receiving leukotriene modifiers appears to be related to unmasking of an underlying vasculitic syndrome that is initially clinically recognized as moderate to severe asthma and treated with corticosteroids. Montelukast does not appear to directly cause the syndrome in these patients.
Cyproconazole, a triazole fungicide, causes hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in CD-1 mice at dose levels of 100 and 200 ppm. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) has been shown to play a significant role in the overall mode of action for several nongenotoxic rodent carcinogens such as phenobarbital. The liver effects of dietary cyproconazole or phenobarbital were investigated after 2, 7, or 14 days in male CD-1, C57BL/6J, and C3H/HeNClrBR mice. Cyproconazole produced similar, dose-responsive effects in all three strains of mice, and the response was similar to that of phenobarbital. Subsequently, Car-null and wild-type male mice on a C3H/HeNClrBR background were administered 200 or 450 ppm cyproconazole, or 850 ppm phenobarbital for up to 7 days. In wild-type mice, 200 ppm cyproconazole caused liver hypertrophy, increased liver weight and cell proliferation, single-cell necrosis and fat vacuolation, effects generally similar to those caused by 850 ppm phenobarbital. Plasma cholesterol was decreased by both compounds, but cyproconazole had a greater effect. The higher dose (450 ppm) of cyproconazole caused similar changes, but greater evidence of liver damage was observed, including a large increase in plasma transaminases. Induction of CAR target genes Cyp2b10 and Gadd45beta was observed with both compounds, whereas the cell cycle regulatory gene Mdm2 was unaffected. In Car-null mice, the effects noted with either cyproconazole or phenobarbital were absent or greatly diminished. These experiments demonstrate that short-term liver effects of cyproconazole in mice are CAR-dependent and similar to those of phenobarbital, a known nongenotoxic rodent liver carcinogen.
This case report is about reversible cardiomyopathy associated with intrathecal baclofen withdrawal. Previous literature has reported that enteral baclofen does not adequately control intrathecal baclofen withdrawal. In our case, coronary atherosclerosis did not play a role in the development of the cardiomyopathy. However, reinstitution of intrathecal baclofen promptly resulted in improvement. One could hypothesize that myocardial stunning from sympathetic hyperactivity led to a similar cardiomyopathy reported with catecholamine excess or acute sympathomimetic poisoning.
The effect of bezafibrate, at doses of 200 mg three times weekly throughout a period of 10 weeks, on lipoprotein (a) and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins including intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) has been studied in 12 patients with chronic renal failure receiving haemodialysis. No side-effects were observed, and serum creatine phosphate kinase values remained within normal limits throughout the duration of the study. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides and apoprotein (apo) B significantly decreased after bezafibrate, whereas apo A-I increased significantly. Serum lipoprotein (a) decreased after bezafibrate, although differences reached no statistical significance. The very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) cholesterol and the VLDL triglycerides decreased from 0.93 +/- 0.45 mmol/l (Mean +/- SD) to 0.54 +/- 0.27 mmol/l (P less than 0.05) and from 1.50 +/- 0.58 mmol/l to 0.91 +/- 0.35 mmol/l (P less than 0.01) respectively. The IDL cholesterol and IDL triglycerides decreased from 0.44 +/- 0.35 mmol/l to 0.20 +/- 0.18 mmol/l (P = NS) and from 0.46 +/- 0.35 mmol/l to 0.17 +/- 0.12 mmol/l (P less than 0.05) respectively. These data, with a substantial improvement of the lipoprotein profile in patients with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis after treatment with bezafibrate, suggest a decrease in the coronary heart disease risk.
Although it is commonly stated that the use of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists is contraindicated in patients with cocaine toxicity, actual clinical evidence of harm is lacking. This case helps to highlight the risks of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists in patients with chest pain associated with cocaine use.
A 54-year-old man was brought to the emergency department (ED) complaining of chest pain after using approximately 1 gram of intranasal cocaine. Aspirin and nitroglycerin spray relieved his pain. Although he remained pain free, tachycardia persisted despite 15 mg of diazepam intravenously. Nearly two hours after presentation, a total of 5 mg of metoprolol was given for persistent tachycardia (115/minute) and an elevated troponin. Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of crushing substernal chest pain, developed pulseless electrical activity, and could not be resuscitated.
The administration of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbates cocaine-induced lethality in animals. In humans given smaller doses of cocaine, beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbate coronary vasoconstriction. Both effects are presumed to occur through unopposed alpha adrenergic receptor agonism. Despite these data, actual cases describing adverse effects in cocaine users given beta adrenergic receptor antagonists are uncommon. This case supports the potential lethality of a cocaine-beta adrenergic receptor antagonist interaction.
The possible ototoxic effect of kanamycin, streptomycin and a standard anti-TB drug combination, used in the treatment of 92 TB patients (7-71 years old), was examined by measuring the highest audible electric bone conduction frequency before and after treatment, using an Audimax 500 audiometer. At the so-called "safe" levels of drug administration it was found that kanamycin was markedly ototoxic, streptomycin very slightly ototoxic and the standard anti-TB drug combination had practically no ototoxic effect. Furthermore, it was found that none of these drugs were gender specific. Lastly, the possible effects of ageing on highest audible bone conduction frequency is discussed.
