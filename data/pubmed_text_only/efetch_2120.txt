In a 61-year-old man with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and poorly controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, an episode of acute haemolysis occurred after the administration of glyburide (glibenclamide). Erythrocyte fragmentation, with haemoglobin condensation zones next to clear zones, was observed on peripheral blood smears. Since autoimmune haemolysis was excluded on the basis of laboratory data, acute haemolysis was ascribed to G6PD deficiency.
This study was designed to test the utility of a latent variable structural equation covariance model for cocaine misuser treatment outcome research. Three structural models were tested for goodness-of-fit of data obtained from a sample of subjects (N = 206) receiving drug misuser treatment in four treatment settings in a treatment program in Nevada. Fourteen variables were entered into the structural equations. An adequately fitting model was found (CFK = .956), [chi 2(6, N = 205) = 15.77, p > .01]. The subjects' discharge rates did not differ significantly by the severity of cocaine misuse at admission.
Naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione (NFD), a bioactive component of Avicennia marina, has been demonstrated to display anti-cancer activity. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced signaling pathway has been correlated with cancer metastasis in various tumors, including breast carcinoma. We use EGF as a metastatic inducer of MDA-MB-231 cells to investigate the effect of NFD on cell migration and invasion. NFD suppressed EGF-mediated protein levels of c-Jun and c-Fos, and reduced MMP-9 expression and activity, concomitantly with a marked inhibition on cell migration and invasion without obvious cellular cytotoxicity. NFD abrogated EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. The specific PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked significantly EGF-induced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 inhibited EGF-induced MMP-9 expression, cell migration and invasion, as well as the activation of PI3K/Akt, suggesting that PI3K/Akt activation occur downstream of EGFR activation. These findings suggest that NFD inhibited the EGF-induced invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells via EGFR-dependent PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to the down-regulation of MMP-9 expression. These results provide a novel mechanism to explain the role of NFD as a potent anti-metastatic agent in MDA-MB-231 cells.
The orexin/hypocretin system has recently been implicated in reward-processing and addiction. We examined the involvement of the orexin system in cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking by administering the orexin 1 receptor antagonist SB-334867 (SB) or the orexin 2 receptor antagonist 4-pyridylmethyl (S)-tert-leucyl 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (4PT) prior to reinstatement testing. Male Sprague Dawley rats self-administered cocaine in 2-h sessions for 10 days, followed by extinction training. Reinstatement of cocaine-seeking was elicited by presentation of tone + light cues previously paired with cocaine infusions. SB (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking without significantly affecting responding during late extinction. 4PT (10 and 30 mg/kg) did not significantly alter cue-induced reinstatement. In separate experiments, the highest doses of SB and 4PT had no significant effect on established cocaine self-administration, and 4PT reduced spontaneous activity in a locomotor test to a greater extent than SB. Finally, SB (30 mg/kg) had no effect on the acquisition of cocaine-paired cues during a Pavlovian cocaine-stimulus conditioning session in the operant chamber. Pretreatment with SB prior to the Pavlovian acquisition session had no effect on subsequent cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking elicited by those cues. However, pretreatment with SB prior to a second reinstatement session in the same animals significantly attenuated the expression of cue-induced reinstatement. These results show that orexin transmission at the orexin 1 receptor, but not the orexin 2 receptor, is necessary for the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking elicited by drug-paired cues and that orexin signaling is not critical for cocaine reinforcement or cocaine-stimulus conditioning.
Fluindione is a vitamin K antagonist that is commonly prescribed for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism in France. Bleeding is the most common side effect of fluindione, whereas hypersensitivity reactions are rare. We describe here a patient with acute immuno-allergic interstitial nephritis caused by fluindione. Initial symptoms included fever, eosinophilia, low albuminuria, microscopic hematuria, eosinophiluria and acute renal failure. Kidney biopsy showed severe interstitial nephritis with interstitial edema, inflammatory infiltrates and tubulorrhexis. Fluindione withdrawal and corticosteroid treatment resulted in rapid recovery of renal function. A review of the literature revealed a very low incidence of fluindione-induced interstitial nephritis, with variable renal and extra-renal signs. Early recognition of this rare complication may prevent the development of severe chronic renal injury.
Mefloquine represents a promising antimalarial drug against Plasmodium falciparum. It has been related to an increase in seizure frequency in epileptic patients and should not be administered to patients with a history of convulsions, epilepsy in first degree relatives, or serious psychiatric disorders. We report a case of a man from the Ivory Coast complaining of fever, headache and anemia treated with chloroquine and subsequently with mefloquine in the suspicion of malaria, even in the absence of laboratory confirmation. When the patient came to our division, malaria was excluded, but the patient developed two convulsive episodes, respectively 4 and 7 days after the ingestion of the second therapeutic dose of mefloquine. Further investigation was performed; particularly an EEG showed abnormalities compatible with tendency for seizures, diffuse waves and spikes. CSF culture was positive for M. tuberculosis as well as urine, sputum and blood cultures. Anti-HIV antibodies were positive, so the final diagnosis was tuberculosis in HIV infection. As seizures are common signs of cerebral tuberculomas, but not of meningitis it is possible that tubercular meningitis might have enhanced severe neuropsychiatric side effects of mefloquine. Physicians should be aware that treatment with mefloquine with concomitant meningitis could have a risk of development of grand mal seizure.
The Pro129THr, C385A, polymorphism of FAAH gene (rs324420C>A) has been associated with overweight and obesity. We investigate the role of this polymorphism on anthropometric and metabolic responses to a weight loss program. Obese individuals (n = 122) were assessed at baseline and after 3 months of a hypocaloric diet. There were 76.2% (n = 93) homozygotes for the C allele, 23.8% (n = 27) AC heterozygotes, and 1.6% (n = 2) homozygotes for the A allele. After the dietary intervention, all individuals decreased their body weight (in kilograms), body mass index (in kilograms per square meter), fat mass (in kilograms), waist circumference (in centimeters), and systolic blood pressure (in millimeters of mercury). In mutant-type group, the decrease in weight was 3.5 ± 3.6 kg (decrease in wild-type group, 2.4 ± 3.8 kg); and the decrease in waist circumference was 5.4 ± 6.4 cm (decrease in wild-type group, 2.6 ± 4.8 cm). Individuals with the A/C or AA genotype had a significant reduction (P < .05) in glucose (96.5 ± 12.5 vs 92.3 ± 10.5 mg/dL; difference, 2.68 ± 1.81 mg/dL), total cholesterol (215.3 ± 49 vs 193.3 ± 27.6 mg/dL; difference, 14.31 ± 7.21 mg/dL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (133.6 ± 53 vs 106.7 ± 39.2 mg/dL; difference, 15.87 ± 9.61 mg/dL) levels. The A allele at rs324420 in the FAAH gene was associated with larger improvements in glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass, and waist circumference after a dietary intervention.
To explore further a recent finding that long-term users of diclofenac are at increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) similar to users of rofecoxib and celecoxib.
Using the General Practice Research Database, we conducted three separate nested case-control studies of three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) where use started after 1 January 1993--diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen. Cases of AMI were identified between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2000. Relative risk (RR) estimates for AMI in patients with no major clinical risk factors were determined for each NSAID according to number of prescriptions received compared with one prescription. Results were adjusted for variables possibly related to risk of AMI.
There was no material elevation of AMI risk according to the number of prescriptions for ibuprofen [RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.0 (0.6, 1.6) and 1.7 (0.9, 3.1) for use of 10-19 and 20+ prescriptions, respectively, compared with one prescription] or naproxen [RRs 1.0 (0.5, 2.2) and 2.0 (0.9, 4.5) for use of 10-19 and 20+ prescriptions, respectively]. However, a substantial increased risk similar to that obtained in our prior study was found in patients who received >or=10 prescriptions for diclofenac [RRs 1.9 (1.3, 2.7) and 2.0 (1.3, 3.0) for use of 10-19 and 20+ prescriptions, respectively].
Extensive use of diclofenac substantially increases the risk of AMI. There is little suggestion of such an effect in users of ibuprofen and naproxen.
The present study was performed to evaluate convulsions after food intake in fasted rats pretreated with scopolamine or atropine and to determine whether these convulsions respond to drugs found effective in fasted mice. Scopolamine (2.4 mg/kg) and atropine (2.4 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally (i.p.) to rats fasted for 52h. Both drugs induced convulsions after animals were allowed to eat ad lib. Another group of fasted rats pretreated with saline, MK-801 (0.1mg/kg), clonidine (0.1mg/kg), chlorpromazine (2 and 4 mg/kg), valproate (200mg/kg), diazepam (1.5 and 2mg/kg) or gabapentin (50mg/kg) were treated i.p. with saline or scopolamine (2.4 mg/kg) and were allowed to eat ad lib. Clonidine, MK-801, chlorpromazine (4 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of scopolamine-induced convulsions in fasted rats. Gabapentin could only prolong the onset of convulsions. Neither treatment was effective against myoclonus of hindlimbs. Present results showed that fasted rats also develop antimuscarinic-induced convulsions which do not completely respond to treatments found effective in convulsions of fasted mice.
Focal, limbic seizures were produced by systemically administered pilocarpine (200 mg/kg, i.p.); as previously described this dose produces limbic stereotypies but neither convulsions nor seizure-related brain damage. The pretreatment, 5 minutes prior pilocarpine, with the D-1 agonist SKF 38393 (-ED50 = 1 mg/kg; i.p.) induced convulsions similar to those produced by a higher, convulsant dose of pilocarpine. On the other hand, the pretreatment with the D-2 agonist LY 171555 failed to induce convulsions. The D-1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 prevented the convulsions induced by SKF 38393 plus pilocarpine (200 mg/kg). This study indicates that D-1, but not D-2, receptor stimulation converts subconvulsant doses of pilocarpine into convulsant ones.
The authors present the case of a child aged 7 years who suffered from relapsing acute lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment consisting mainly of oral and intrathecal methotrexate and x-ray therapy produced remission of the hematologic symptoms. Three years after the onset of the leukemia, mental deterioration gradually appeared. Radiography of the skull revealed diffuse bilateral calcium deposits in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. Four years after the onset of the disease, a hematologic relapse occurred. Behavioral disorders became more severe and the child died after a period of seizures and unconsciousness. The main pathologic data obtained by the study of a brain biopsy and after a complete postmortem examination consisted of calcifications located bilaterally in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. No signs of leukemia were present. Cerebral calcification is an extremely rare complication in the course of the therapy of lymphocytic leukemia. Its possible causes are discussed.
The genotoxicity of methapyrilne (MP) has been evaluated in a number of assays since it was found to be a rat hepatocarcinogen with subsequent withdrawal as an over-the-counter antihistamine. Whilst it has not been classified as a genotoxin, there are reports of positive findings from mammalian cell gene mutation and transformation assays. To investigate further the genotoxic potential of MP, the alkaline Comet assay was used to evaluate DNA damage both in primary hepatocytes in culture and in vivo in the rat. To confirm bioactivation was required to induce the hepatotoxic mechanism, aminobenzotriazole, a broad spectrum cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor was used as a pre-treatment. The levels of glutathione and glutathione disulfide were determined in both hepatocytes in culture and in the liver following in vivo exposure. MP showed significant increases in DNA damage in freshly isolated male rat hepatocyte suspensions that could be significantly reduced by pre-incubation of aminobenzotriazole (ABT). DNA damage showed a marked sex difference, with male hepatocytes being more susceptible, and showing a concurrent depletion of glutathione (GSH) compared with female hepatocytes. Modulation of the GSH levels by diethylmaleate and γ-glutamylcysteinylethyl ester, elevated and reduced the levels of DNA damage, respectively. In the in vivo Comet assay, there was no evidence of DNA damage following MP (150mg/kg p.o) treatment for three consecutive days, although histological and liver enzyme changes were seen. Total protein GSH content was elevated in MP-treated animals and superoxide dismutase levels were increased specifically in periportal regions. Taken together, these data support the potential for MP to induce oxidative stress. The differences in DNA damage detected by the Comet assay in vitro, and in rat liver in vivo, could be attributed to differences in metabolism and response to oxidant insult or the inability of the assay to discriminate damage in a small number of individual cells in the whole liver.
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (HRIs) were found incidentally to reduce new cases of colon cancer in 2 large clinical trials evaluating coronary events, although most patients in both treatment and control group were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are associated with reduced colon cancer incidence, predominantly by increasing apoptosis. We showed previously that lovastatin induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells. In the present study we evaluated the potential of combining lovastatin with sulindac for colon cancer chemoprevention.
Lovastatin, 10-30 micromol/L, augmented sulindac-induced apoptosis up to 5-fold in 3 colon cancer cell lines. This was prevented by mevalonate (100 micromol/L) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (10 micromol/L) but not farnesylpyrophosphate (100 micromol/L), suggesting inhibition of geranylgeranylation of target protein(s) as the predominant mechanism. In an azoxymethane rat model of chemical-induced carcinogenesis, the total number of colonic aberrant crypt foci per animal (control, 161 +/- 11) and the number of foci with 4+ crypts (control, 40 +/- 4.5) decreased to 142 +/- 14 (NS) and 43 +/- 2.9 (NS), respectively, with 50 ppm lovastatin alone; to 137 +/- 5.4 (P = 0.053) and 36 +/- 2.1 (NS) with 80 ppm sulindac alone; and to 116 +/- 8.1 (P = 0.004) and 28 +/- 3.4 (P = 0.02) when 50 ppm lovastatin and 80 ppm sulindac were combined.
Addition of an HRI such as lovastatin may augment chemopreventive effects of NSAIDs or/and may allow lower, less toxic doses of these drugs to be used.
Eight patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum, previously untreated with chemotherapy, were treated with a new anthracycline 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (pirarubicin). Pirarubicin was given intravenously at the rate of 5 mg per minute, at doses ranging from 35 to 70 mg/m2 once every 21 days. On clinical evaluation, one patient had complete response lasting 4 months. On second-look laparotomy residual tumor was found and she was labelled a partial responder and changed to alternate chemotherapy. Another patient had a partial response of recurrent chest wall tumors lasting 11 months. A third patient had a partial response lasting 4+ months of a pleural-based tumor and resolution of pleural effusion. After the fifth course of chemotherapy, he developed severe granulocytopenia, pseudomonas sepsis, shock, and renal failure. Despite recovery of blood counts to normal within 3 days, renal failure proved fatal. Autopsy revealed only fibrosis and no gross or microscopic evidence of malignant mesothelioma. A fourth patient had improvement in evaluable disease lasting about 4 months; and the remaining four had stable disease for at least 2 months each. The authors conclude that, whenever feasible, noninvasive clinical assessment of tumor response should be supplemented by surgical-pathologic evaluation. Pirarubicin is active in malignant mesothelioma. This is the first report documenting complete tumor eradication after chemotherapy in an adult with malignant mesothelioma.
The efficacy of lamotrigine and felbamate against maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures was assessed under conditions mimicking the pharmacoresistance associated with an increased excitatory neurotransmission. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), but not kainate applied at subconvulsive dose, reduced the activity of lamotrigine against MES-induced seizures increasing its ED50 value from 4.3 (3.2-5.6) to 6.1 (5.2-7.2) mg/kg (p < 0.001). This effect was reversed by co-application of an NMDAreceptor antagonist D-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (CGP 40116) at 0.1 mg/kg [4.5 (3.7-5.6) vs. 6.1 (5.2-7.2) mg/kg; p < 0.001]. The anticonvulsive action of felbamate was altered by neither NMDAnor kainate. In conclusion, the data presented here indicate that felbamate, but not lamotrigine, effectively prevents generalized tonic-clonic seizures, also when NMDA-mediated neurotransmission is enhanced. The impaired antiepileptic potential of lamotrigine might be restored in such scenario by the co-administration of a very low dose of NMDA receptor antagonist.
The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) induces DNA demethylation and re-expression of epigenetically silenced genes, and increases carboplatin sensitivity of tumor xenograft models. We designed a clinical study to determine the feasibility of delivering a dose of decitabine, combined with carboplatin, that would be capable of producing equivalent biologic effects in patients with solid tumors.
In a two-stage design, 33 patients received escalating doses of decitabine administered as a 6-hour infusion on day 1 followed by carboplatin, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 5 (cohort 1) and AUC 6 (cohort 2), on day 8 of a 28-day cycle. Pharmacodynamic analyses included 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine levels, MAGE1A CpG island methylation, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression.
The major toxicity was myelosuppression. Dose limiting toxicities, prolonged grade 4 neutropenia (one patient), and sepsis and grade 3 anorexia/fatigue (one patient), were seen in two of four patients treated with decitabine 135 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 5. Dose limiting toxicity comprising neutropenic sepsis (one patient) and grade 3 fatigue (one patient) was seen in two of 10 patients treated at decitabine 90 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6. Decitabine induced dose-dependent, reversible demethylation in peripheral-blood cells (PBCs) maximally at day 10. Furthermore, decitabine 90 mg/m2 induced demethylation of the MAGE1A CpG island in PBCs, buccal cells, and tumor biopsies, as well as elevation of HbF expression.
Decitabine can be combined safely with carboplatin at a dose and schedule that causes epigenetic changes equivalent to or greater than that observed in mice with carboplatin-sensitized xenografts. The recommended dose/schedule for phase II trials is decitabine 90 mg/m2 (day 1) followed by carboplatin AUC 6 (day 8) every 28 days.
A 14-year-old boy with mental retardation presented with severe thrombocytopenia, macrocytic anaemia and allergic dermatitis. He had been treated with valproate for seizures since the age of 2 years. Clinical examination showed severe purpura, mucous bleeding and extensive dermatitis. Tests to detect serum direct antiplatelet antibodies were positive and bone marrow examination revealed myelodysplastic abnormalities. Valproate was discontinued and both dermatitis and general condition of the child improved with normalization of the full blood count. This report suggests that valproate may produce both peripheral immune thrombocytopenia and severe bone marrow depression several years after the initiation of the therapy.
Previous research has determined that rats reared in an enriched condition (EC) are more sensitive to the effects of acute systemic amphetamine than rats raised in an impoverished condition (IC).
The present experiments examined the effect of environmental enrichment on locomotor activity following repeated injections of nicotine. Experiment 1 assessed differences in locomotor activity in EC and IC rats and experiment 2 assessed differences between EC rats and rats housed in pairs without novel objects or daily handling (social condition; SC) to determine whether enrichment causes changes beyond that of social contact alone.
In experiment 1, EC and IC rats were treated with saline, 0.2 mg/kg or 0.8 mg/kg nicotine, and locomotor activity was assessed for 60 min. Nicotine-induced activity was measured every 48 h for a total of eight sessions. All rats were challenged with 0.8 mg/kg nicotine on session 9. In experiment 2, EC and SC rats were treated with saline or 0.2 mg/kg nicotine, and locomotor activity was assessed using the same regimen as in experiment 1.
In experiment 1, EC rats exhibited less sensitivity than IC rats to the psychostimulant effect of nicotine upon both acute and repeated administration. On the nicotine challenge session (session 9), EC rats were again less sensitive to the hyperactive effects of nicotine. In experiment 2, EC rats were also less sensitive than SC rats to nicotine-induced hyperactivity across repeated injections.
These results suggest that environmental enrichment during development reduces the stimulant effect of nicotine.
The role played by insulin and the adrenergic system in the development of hypokalemia due to intravenous ritodrine has been evaluated. Fifteen women presenting with premature labor (group 1) were treated with ritodrine infusion, whereas seven pregnant women not in labor (group 2) were given 100 g glucose per os to induce hyperinsulinemia without participation of ritodrine. Serum glucose, insulin, potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium were measured hourly. Whereas insulin levels were higher in group 2, potassium decreased markedly and significantly only in group 1. It is concluded that ritodrine-induced hypokalemia, that results partially from hyperinsulinemia, is mostly determined by other factors and is possibly a consequence of direct beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Significant hypocalcemia of unexplained origin was observed with ritodrine.
Fifty-nine nursing home patients (average age, 79.9 +/- .9 years) receiving chlorpropamide were screened with a serum sodium determination. Nine patients (15.3 percent) had a serum sodium concentration less than 135 mEq/L; six of these patients (10.2 percent) had a serum sodium equal to or less than 130 mEq/L; none of the patients had a serum sodium less than 125 mEq/L. Five hyponatremic patients (Na less than or equal to 130 mEq/L) and nine normonatremic patients (Na greater than or equal to 135 mEq/L) were screened with a standardized mental status examination and additional laboratory studies. The hyponatremic patients were switched to tolazamide after a one-week wash-out period, and the mental status examination and laboratory studies were repeated in both groups four weeks later. One patient in the hyponatremic group died during the course of the study; the other four became normonatremic on tolazamide. Mental status scores increased significantly in the hyponatremic group, 16.0 +/- 3.6 to 20 +/- 4.6 (a 37.3 +/- 21.5 percent increase), compared with the normonatremic group, 14.5 +/- 2.6 to 15.8 +/- 2.9 (a 7.8 +/- 3.2 percent increase). There were no significant differences in serum glucose, creatinine, chlorpropamide, or antidiuretic hormone concentrations between the two groups. It is recommended that periodic serum sodium determinations be obtained in geriatric patients receiving chlorpropamide.
To explore the relationship between DNA polymerase β (pol β) overexpression and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) carcinogenesis.
Firstly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts that express wild-type level of DNA polymerase β (pol β cell) and high level of pol β (pol β oe cell) were treated by various concentrations of BaP to determine genetic instability induced by BaP under differential expression levels of pol β. Secondly, malignant transformation of pol β cells by low concentration of BaP (20 μM) was determined by soft agar colony formation assay and transformation focus assay. Thirdly, the mRNA and protein levels of BaP-transformed pol β cells (named pol β-T cells) was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot, and the genetic instability of these cells were examined by HPRT gene mutation assay and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay.
Pol β cells were successfully transformed into malignant pol β-T cells by an exposure to low concentration of BaP for 6 months. Pol β-T cells exhibited increased levels of pol β gene expression, HPRT gene mutation frequency and polymorphisms of RAPD products that were comparable to those of pol β oe cells.
Pol β overexpression and its-associated genetic instability may play a key role in BaP carcinogenesis.
Psoriasis is associated with abnormal plasma lipid metabolism and a high frequency of cardiovascular events. Increased lipid levels are also seen in patients with psoriasis treated with acitretin. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) variants have been linked to hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia in normal individuals. Two coding single nucleotide polymorphisms at +3937 and +4075 define the three common ApoE alleles e2, e3 and e4.
To test the hypothesis that particular ApoE polymorphism(s) are associated with psoriasis and that specific ApoE allelic variant(s) may be a marker for predicting disease response to acitretin.
DNA was genotyped for ApoE polymorphisms using a radioactive hybridization technique in cohorts of patients with psoriasis, including patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP, n = 212), guttate psoriasis (GP, n = 94), palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP, n = 101), controls (n = 137), acitretin responders (n =106) and acitretin nonresponders (n = 84).
The frequency of the e4 allele (+3937C/+4075C) was significantly higher in patients with CPP and GP than in controls (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02, respectively). There was no significant difference in allele frequencies between patients with PPP and controls. Allelic distribution was similar in acitretin responders and nonresponders.
These data demonstrate an association between the Apo e4 allele and CPP and GP, suggesting a possible pathogenic role for ApoE in psoriasis. Our results do not support a link between disease response to acitretin and the e2, e3 or e4 allelic variants of ApoE.
Mizoribine (MZR), a purine nucleoside antibiotic, is an effective immunosuppressive agent that prevents rejection reactions after kidney transplantation in humans. The present study was performed to examine the effect of MZR on nephrosis produced in rats given puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). Urinary protein excretion in rats injected with PAN and MZR (PAN + MZR rats) was shown to be reduced significantly in comparison with rats given only PAN (PAN rats). Although mild hypoproteinemia persisted during the experimental period in PAN + MZR rats, no loss of body weight or state of malnutrition was observed. The reduction of serum IgG and C3 was reversed by administration of MZR. Polyethyleinamine (PEI) staining of renal sections showed increased numbers of anionic sites in PAN + MZR rats in comparison with PAN rats, suggesting that MZR improved the permselectivity of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Moreover, the production of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) was significantly inhibited in PAN + MZR rats compared with PAN rats. No serious adverse effects of MZR were observed after a large dose of the agent. It is possible that restoration of the charge barrier of the GBM damaged by PAN, or reduction of TxB2 production by the glomeruli may underlie the reduction of protein excretion induced by administration of MZR.
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have several properties which may have beneficial effects on the development of atherosclerosis. These include inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration; inhibition of calcium influx into the vascular wall; reduction of extracellular matrix synthesis; promotion of uptake and breakdown of low-density lipoproteins; protection of lipoproteins from oxidative modification; maintenance of endothelial cell function; inhibition of platelet activation; and reduction of blood pressure. Although some of these effects are only seen at high drug concentrations, the great majority of reports indicate that CCBs can attenuate atherogenesis in animal models, notably the cholesterol-fed rabbit. Several clinical trials have now attempted to determine the efficacy of these drugs in human atheromatous disease. The outcome of these studies, including the International Nifedipine Trial of Antiatherosclerotic Therapy (INTACT), the Montreal Nicardipine Trial, and the Multicenter Isradipine/Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), are summarized in this review, in the context of trials currently in progress. The emerging evidence suggests that an antiatherosclerotic action can be demonstrated in patients but the extent and clinical importance of this effect have yet to be fully established.
The problem of organ preservation in the management of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) comes about especially in patients of reproductive age. Two hundred and fifty-four women with a diagnosis of AEH were hospitalized in our clinic from the period 1991 to 2000. Of those, atypical endometrial hyperplasia with normal uter and appendages was found in 192 women. The remaining 62 patients had diseases of the cervix, corpus uteri, ovaries and oviducts and were subjected to radical hysterectomy. To define the possible sparing tactics of management, 192 women with AEH were divided into two groups. The patients in Group were administered hormonal therapy during a three month period (17alpha OPC - 12.5 g, Depo-Provera - 6 g). If a clinical effect and histological pathomorphism were achieved the patients were subjected to an additional three months of hormonotherapy. Of a total of 96 patients in the first group, 36 (37.5%) who were prescribed hormonotherapy were found to also have mastopathy and endocrine pathology dysfunction of the thyroid gland, and were additionally administered iodine-containing preparations. After completion of the effective hormonotherapy three patients had a normal pregnancy and delivery. Conservative management proved to be effective in 96.4% and ineffective in seven (3.6%) cases. These seven patients were subjected to surgical treatment. All patients in Group 2 were subjected to radical hysterectomy.
