Since its introduction in 1985, the new fluoroquinolone antibiotic ofloxacin has gained widespread use, and much information has accumulated about its possible adverse effects. Skin reactions have been uncommon, and there have been very few reports about hypersensitivity vasculitis directly related to ofloxacin. The authors report such a case, in which the patient needed plastic surgery because of severe vasculitis in both legs.
While many studies of adults with solvent exposure have shown increased risks of anxiety and depressive disorders, there is little information on the impact of prenatal and early childhood exposure on the subsequent risk of mental illness. This retrospective cohort study examined whether early life exposure to tetrachloroethylene (PCE)-contaminated drinking water influenced the occurrence of depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia among adults from Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
A total of 1,512 subjects born between 1969 and 1983 were studied, including 831 subjects with both prenatal and early childhood PCE exposure and 547 unexposed subjects. Participants completed questionnaires to gather information on mental illnesses, demographic and medical characteristics, other sources of solvent exposure, and residences from birth through 1990. PCE exposure originating from the vinyl-liner of water distribution pipes was assessed using water distribution system modeling software that incorporated a leaching and transport algorithm.
No meaningful increases in risk ratios (RR) for depression were observed among subjects with prenatal and early childhood exposure (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.9-1.4). However, subjects with prenatal and early childhood exposure had a 1.8-fold increased risk of bipolar disorder (N = 36 exposed cases, 95% CI: 0.9-1.4), a 1.5-fold increased risk post-traumatic stress disorder (N = 47 exposed cases, 95% CI: 0.9-2.5), and a 2.1-fold increased risk of schizophrenia (N = 3 exposed cases, 95% CI: 0.2-20.0). Further increases in the risk ratio were observed for bipolar disorder (N = 18 exposed cases, RR; 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.6) and post-traumatic stress disorder (N = 18 exposed cases, RR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.9-3.2) among subjects with the highest exposure levels.
The results of this study provide evidence against an impact of early life exposure to PCE on the risk of depression. In contrast, the results provide support for an impact of early life exposure on the risk of bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The number of schizophrenia cases was too small to draw reliable conclusions. These findings should be confirmed in investigations of other similarly exposed populations.
A case of repeated tonic-chlonic seizures and opisthotonus which developed after anesthesia with propofol (Deprivan) in a woman aged 43 years is described. The seizures continued for seven days despite antiepileptic therapy. On the basis of this case and other case reports, it is recommended that propofol should only be employed with reservation in patients with known epilepsy or predisposition to epilepsy.
We describe a case of a 15-year-old boy with vincristine-induced simultaneous isolated bilateral facial palsy. The boy presented with superior vena caval syndrome (SVC syndrome), right-sided pleural effusion and anterior mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Histopathological examination of left axillary lymph node was suggestive of lymphoblastic lymphoma. We started chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone. SVC syndrome disappeared completely after the 1st cycle, and he achieved remission after the 3rd cycle of chemotherapy. He noticed that he could not close his eyes. Neurological examination revealed bilateral lower motor neuron facial palsy. Findings from examination of other cranial nerves and peripheral nerves were normal. Results of MRI of brain and cerebrospinal fluid examination were normal. He received 6 mg vincristine before developing toxicity.
This report describes unique contrast enhancement of the white matter on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of two patients with disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, which developed from acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with high-dose methotrexate. In both patients, the enhancement was more pronounced near the base of the brain than at the vertex. Necropsy of the first case revealed loss of myelination and necrosis of the white matter. Possible mechanisms causing such a leukoencephalopathy are discussed.
A woman treated with cyclophosphamide for rheumatoid arthritis developed carcinoma of the urinary bladder at the age of 51 years. Several similar cases reported in the literature suggests an increased risk of bladder cancer in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. There is need for a continuous follow-up with urinalysis in patients previously treated with this drug.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent chemotherapy drug with a narrow therapeutic window. Nilotinib, a small-molecule Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was reported to reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transmembrane transporters. The present study aimed to investigate nilotinib's affection on the steady-state pharmacokinetics, disposition and cardiotoxicity of DOX. A total of 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups (6 in each) and received the following regimens: saline, intravenous DOX (5mg/kg) alone, and DOX co-administrated with either 20 or 40mg/kg nilotinib. Blood was withdrawn at 12 time points till 72h after DOX injection and the concentrations of DOX and its metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol) in serum and cardiac tissue were assayed by LC-MS-MS method. To determine the cardiotoxicity, the following parameters were investigated: creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase. Histopathological examination of heart section was carried out to evaluate the extent of cardiotoxicity after treatments. The results showed that pretreatment of 40mg/kg nilotinib increased the AUC0-t and Cmax of DOX and DOXol. However, their accumulation in cardiac tissue was significantly decreased when compared with the group that received DOX alone. In addition, biochemical and histopathological results showed that 40mg/kg nilotinib reduced the cardiotoxicity induced by DOX administration. In conclusion, co-administration of nilotinib increased serum exposure, but significantly decreased the accumulation of DOX in cardiac tissue. Consistent with in vitro profile, oral dose of 40mg/kg nilotinib significantly decreased the cardiotoxicity of DOX in rat by enhancing P-gp activity in the heart.
Notch and TLR pathways were found to act cooperatively to activate Notch target genes and to increase the production of TLR-induced cytokines in macrophages. However, the mechanism of LPS-induced Notch activation and its role in sepsis still remains unclear.
We analyzed the expression patterns of Notch components in a LPS-stimulated murine macrophage cell line using real-time PCR and western blotting. The role of DAPT, a gamma-secretase inhibitor that is known to be a potent Notch inhibitor, in LPS-induced cytokine release and experimental sepsis in mice was also explored. Student's t-test was used to analyze the difference between the two groups.
We found that Notch signaling was activated after LPS stimulation. The expression of Jagged 1, a Notch ligand, induced by LPS occurred in a JNK-dependent manner. In addition, Notch target genes were upregulated by early Notch-independent activation followed by delayed Notch-dependent activation after LPS stimulation. Disruption of Notch signaling by DAPT attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory responses, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and high-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1), both in vitro and in vivo and partially improved experimental sepsis survival.
These findings support the existence of a synergistic effect of Notch signaling and the LPS pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, in the future Notch inhibitors may be utilized as adjunctive agents for the treatment of sepsis syndrome.
Although heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is thought to produce hypertrophy in isolated cardiomyocytes via an autocrine mechanism, the pathophysiological role of HB-EGF, in myocardial hypertrophy in vivo, is not yet known. To investigate the involvement of HB-EGF in cardiac remodeling associated with hypertension in vivo, we assayed the expression of HB-EGF mRNA and protein in the left ventricle (LV) during the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).
Prior to sacrifice and assay of HB-EGF and EGF-receptor (EGF-R) mRNA, morphologic and hemodynamic variables were measured in SHR and in age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). At 5, 9 and 12 weeks of age, rats were killed, their hearts were removed, and the expression of HB-EGF and EGF-R mRNA and protein were measured. In addition, SHR and WKY were treated with enalapril, atenolol, or both for 4 weeks.
In untreated SHR, double products (i.e. systolic blood pressure (sBP) multiplied by heart rate (HR), an index of mechanical load, peaked at 9 weeks. Expression of HB-EGF mRNA was also observed to peak in these animals at 9 weeks, while expression of EGF-R mRNA increased from 5 to 9 weeks, but remained constant thereafter. In untreated WKY, double products and EGF-R mRNA expression did not change over time, whereas the level of HB-EGF message increased gradually. Antibody to HB-EGF reacted primarily with myocyte membranes in SHR, whereas antibody to EGF-R reacted mainly with interstitial cells in these animals. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, markedly decreased sBP in SHR, whereas the beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, atenolol, significantly decreased HR. While neither alone affected the expression of HB-EGF mRNA, their combination significantly reduced the expression of HB-EGF mRNA, as well as double products, in these rats, but had no effect on expression of EGF-R mRNA.
The enhanced expression of HB-EGF mRNA and protein in LV of SHR suggest that this growth factor may play an important role during the early development of LV hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in SHR. The association between double products and HB-EGF expression suggest that the latter may be induced by increased mechanical load and may contribute, in turn, to cardiac remodeling.
Resveratrol (3,4',5-tri-hydroxy-trans-stilbene) is an antioxidant constituent of a wide variety of plant species including grapes. It has gained considerable attention because of its anticancer properties, as shown in solid and hematologic malignancies. Whether resveratrol could inhibit proliferation or induce cytotoxicity in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) was investigated.
We studied resveratrol-induced inhibition of proliferation and induction of cytotoxicity in WM cell lines, WM primary tumor cells, IgM-secreting cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The mechanisms of action and different signaling pathways involved were studied using Western blot and gene expression profile analysis. Resveratrol activity was also evaluated in the bone marrow microenvironment. We finally investigated whether or not resveratrol could have any synergistic effect if used in combination with other drugs widely used in the treatment of WM.
A schematic image illustrating the location and expression of the aurora kinases A, B, and C during mitosis. Resveratrol inhibited proliferation and induced cytotoxicity against WM cells, IgM-secreting cells, as well as primary WM cells, without affecting peripheral blood mononuclear cells; down-regulated Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases, and Wnt signaling pathways, as well as Akt activity; induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; and triggered c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal-kinase activation, followed by the activation of intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways. Lastly, adherence to bone marrow stromal cells did not confer protection to WM cells against resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, resveratrol showed synergistic cytotoxicity when combined with dexamethasone, fludarabine, and bortezomib.
Our data show that resveratrol has significant antitumor activity in WM, providing the framework for clinical trials in this disease.
A case of refractory hypotension following propranolol overdose is reported. Management included isoprenaline, glucagon and extracorporeal circulatory support using femoral vein-femoral artery bypass. The unreliability of neurological observations, especially unreactive pupils, in the presence of drug overdose is reiterated.
Methylphenidate (MPD) is widely prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit disorders in children and has generally been thought to be free of significant side effects when administered at recommended therapeutic doses. However, recent behavioral research with laboratory rodents has indicated that, like other psychostimulants with which it shares neurotransmitter-modulating properties, chronically administered MPD can bring about lasting and potentially detrimental alterations in brain function. Some of these may involve changes in the neuromodulatory input from noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems that project to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, regions with significant roles in several cognitive functions, including those critical to memory formation. To investigate the possibility of cognitive impairment, the effects of a regimen of chronic MPD on the performance of an object recognition task known to rely on the integrity of systems involved in rodent memory was assessed. The drug, at doses of 2, 3 or 5mg/kg, was delivered twice daily to periadolescent rats via an oral administration technique on either 11 or 21 treatment days. Subsequent to this period, the animals were subjected to an object recognition test at 14, 28, and 42 days after their last MPD treatment. In each of these tests, exploration time for two objects, one novel and one previously encountered (3h earlier), was assessed. Longer exploration of the novel object was considered evidence of retained memory for the familiar object. It was found that rats exposed to 3 or 5mg/kg (b.i.d.) on 21 occasions exhibited no significant preference for exploration of the novel object at any of the three post-treatment intervals. This finding was interpreted as evidence of a persisting MPD-induced impairment of recognition memory in these animals.
Digoxin is clinically useful as a cardiac antiarrhythmic and inotropic agent. Its antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through the cholinergic nervous system. The cholinergic system, when activated, can depress ventricular function. We have sought to further increase the cardiovascular effects of digoxin by blocking its cholinergic effects with atropine. Atropine, 1 mg intravenously, was given to 10 postoperative cardiac patients. The cardiovascular time course was monitored by an ECG, radial arterial line, and pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter for 8 hours. A significant increase (p less than 0.05) in the cardiac output (CO), from 5.98 +/- 0.24 L/min to 6.60 +/- 0.34 L/min, was evident within 2 hours after atropine administration. The CO returned to control levels by 6 hours. There were no significant changes in heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, or systemic blood pressure. The results indicate that the cholinergic blockade of digoxin with atropine will acutely increase the cardiac output in postoperative cardiac patients.
The case of a girl with cloverleaf skull (CLS) and multiple congenital anomalies is reported. Both parents have a history of drug use. Maternal cocaine abuse during the first trimester of pregnancy was obvious, and other drugs, such as marihuana and alcohol, were also taken by the mother. Many central nervous system malformations have been reported in association with cocaine abuse, the most severe being midline defects and neural tube defects. To our knowledge this is the first case reported of CLS anomaly associated with drug exposure. We also describe other anomalies not previously reported in association with CLS.
Radiographic contrast media used for angiographic procedures are hyperosmolar and induce sickling in vitro of erythrocytes from patients with sickle cell disorders. We treated a 51-year-old black woman with hemoglobin SC disease, but without a history of painful crises, who developed severe intravascular hemolysis and pulmonary infiltrates following administration of a contrast agent for coronary angiography and ventriculography. This case emphasizes the potential for severe complications following administration of the currently available contrast agents to patients with sickle cell disease. We suggest that newer contrast agents with lower osmolality than the commonly used ones need to be carefully evaluated for radiologic studies in patients with sickle cell disease.
Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of foot pain and may be disabling. Although localized injection is painful, anesthetics or corticosteroids can relieve symptoms well. Bone scintigraphy can confirm the diagnosis. We hypothesized that blood-pool abnormalities could provide prognostic information on the response to such injections.
We devised scintigraphic criteria that graded the blood-pool abnormalities as being localized to the plantar enthesis, being localized to half the length of the aponeurosis, or involving the whole aponeurosis. We evaluated 24 patients with an established diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, 8 of whom had bilateral disease, leading to a total of 32 feet injected.
After injection, pain was relieved either completely or nearly completely in 20 feet. The other 12 feet had short-term or no improvement, with persistent pain and loss of function at 4-5 wk after injection. Of the 20 feet responding to injection, 14 had focal hyperemia on blood-pool images and 6 had minimal extension into the proximal third of the plantar soft tissues. No patient with diffuse hyperemia in the plantar fascia had a response (5/12 feet). On the delayed images of the 20 responders, mild inferior calcaneal uptake was seen in 8 feet, moderate uptake in 6, and severe uptake in 6. These groups did not significantly differ (P > 0.05). The blood-pool studies had good reproducibility, with a kappa-value of 0.64.
Critical evaluation of plantar blood-pool images provides prognostic information on the response to localized injection into the enthesis. Reporting such studies is simple and reproducible.
The neuromuscular block produced by neomycin is unique. Despite nearly complete blockade of the twitch the tetanus is not blocked and does not fade. The pathognomonic post-tetanic exhaustion has not been reported previously. Anticholinesterases and calcium antagonize the block, but the antagonism may not be complete. Germine antagonizes the block in the cat, but its clinical value has not been tested. These characteristics of neuromuscular block by neomycin strongly suggest respiratory support and sedation to decrease the respiratory drive, rather than attempts at antagonism, as the rational management of patients suffering from toxic paralysis due to neomycin.
1-Methylpyrene (1-MP), an abundant alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is activated by side-chain hydroxylation to 1-hydroxymethylpyrene (1-HMP) and subsequent sulfo-conjugation to electrophilic 1-sulfooxymethylpyrene (1-SMP). In rats, this activation mainly occurs in liver. 1-SMP may react with hepatic DNA or be exported into the blood circulation to reach other tissues, in particular kidneys. Findings with recombinant cell lines suggest that renal 1-SMP uptake proceeds via organic anion transporters (OATs). Here, we tested the hypothesis that probenecid, a characteristic OAT inhibitor, interferes with kidney damage brought about by 1-SMP formed in rats. 1-HMP was administered intraperitoneally to 30 rats, half of which were co-treated with probenecid. The tissue distribution of DNA adducts was analyzed using (32)P-postlabeling and isotope dilution LC-MS/MS for the detection of the adducts N(2)-(1-methylpyrenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine and N(6)-(1-methylpyrenyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine. In rats treated solely with 1-HMP, adduct levels in kidney tissue were about 3-fold and 8-fold higher than those in liver and lung, respectively. After co-treatment with probenecid, hepatic and pulmonary adduct levels were 12-fold and 4-fold elevated, respectively, whereas renal adduct levels were slightly lower compared to those of rats receiving 1-HMP alone. Moreover, serum levels of 1-SMP were increased 23-fold in animals pre-treated with probenecid. The differential effects on hepatic and pulmonary adduct levels suggest that not only renal OATs, but also additional anion transporters, e.g. those mediating the hepatic export of 1-SMP into the bile, were inhibited. Thus, transmembrane transport proteins play a crucial role in the distribution of reactive phase II metabolites, and thereby in tissue allocation of DNA adducts.
Stable prostaglandin analogs are known to induce lymphopenia and neutrophilia in a dose-dependent fashion after subcutaneous injection in rats. The purpose of the present investigation is to determine whether the prostaglandin-induced changes in circulating leukocytes might be secondary to hypotension with the ensuing release of adrenal hormones. The adrenal medullary catecholamine epinephrine was found to induce neutrophilia in both intact and adrenalectomized rats, and the glucocorticosteroid analog dexamethasone induced a profound lymphopenia in rats as reported by previous investigators. A stable analog of PGF2 alpha (15-S-15-methyl PGF2 alpha; M-PGF2 alpha) at the dose of 1 mg/kg induced marked systemic hypotension 1 h after injection, with lymphopenia and neutrophilia 6 h after injection. The non-prostanoid hypotensive agent captopril, at a dose of 63 mg/kg, induced a hypotension of similar magnitude and kinetics to that induced by prostaglandin. Captopril also induced lymphopenia and neutrophilia at 6 h, although the neutrophilia was of lesser magnitude than that induced by prostaglandins. The prostaglandin-induced lymphopenia was found to be mediated, at least in part, by the hypotension-induced release of adrenal hormones, as evidenced by the abrogation of lymphopenia in prostaglandin-treated adrenalectomized rats. Captopril-treated adrenalectomized rats, however, did develop a significant lymphopenia, suggesting that hypotension can result in lymphopenia even in adrenalectomized rats. The M-PGF2 alpha-induced neutrophilia in adrenalectomized rats, by comparison to captopril-induced neutrophilia in adrenalectomized rats, was greater than the neutrophilia expected as the result of hypotension alone. Indeed, the M-PGF2 alpha-induced neutrophilia in adrenalectomized rats was greater than the captopril-induced neutrophilia in sham-adrenalectomized rats. Thus, a portion of the neutrophilia induced by M-PGF2 alpha in intact rats may be mediated through adrenal-independent, hemodynamic-independent mechanisms. The possibility that M-PGF2 alpha might be inducing neutrophilia via an endotoxin-like stress reaction was investigated by examining changes in circulating white blood cells in intact and adrenalectomized C3H/HeN (endotoxin-sensitive) and C3H/HeJ (endotoxin-resistant) mice after prostaglandin administration. No quantitative differences in the prostaglandin-induced neutrophilia were noted in C3H/HeJ mice as compared to the C3H/HeN mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Microcystin-LR (MCLR) produced by freshwater cyanobacteria is a potent hepatotoxin and inhibits protein serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A). Okadaic acid (OA) is a similar phosphatase inhibitor, which has less affinity to PP1 than PP2A. MCLR and OA behave similarly with primary culture hepatocytes with the induction of phosphorylation of the cytokeratins, morphological changes, and apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo relationship between the protein phosphatase inhibitory activities and the acute hepatotoxicity of MCLR compared to OA. MCLR and OA were intraperitoneally administrated to mice at approximately 220 microg/kg. After 30 min, the liver of only the MCLR-treated mouse was dark-colored and heavier than that of the control mouse. Subsequently, the phosphoproteins of the mouse liver were chemically modified with reversible biotinylation reagent and selectively analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Consequently, the phosphorylated Ser 354 of formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, which is an abundant enzyme in the liver cytoplasm, was observed in the MCLR- and the OA-treated mice 9.5 and 5.3 times more intensely than in the control mouse respectively, suggesting that MCLR and OA inhibited PP2A and induced the resulting phosphorylation. These results supported the hypothesis that the acute hepatotoxicity is possibly caused by the PP1 inhibition, and not by the PP2A inhibition.
A total of 1840 children and adolescents treated with cyproterone acetate (CPA) to block gonadal function, as a treatment for precocious puberty, short stature and other disorders, were registered to survey for the risk of developing hepatic tumors. Patients responding to follow-up numbered 1552 (85%). The cumulative dose and duration of CPA therapy for boys and girls were 110.4g and 2.6 years, and 122.9 g and 2.8 years, respectively. Among the 1552 patients, five hepatoma cases were found. Four underwent successful surgery and remain alive and well to date. Two of the 5 cases had been given more than 500g, the other 3 more than 1000 g, of CPA. Three had also been given androgens before CPA administration. Although further follow-up is necessary to monitor for the development of adenoma and hepatoma, the risk of developing these tumors among patients to whom limited doses of CPA were administered appears to be negligible.
Fifty current or past amphetamine dependent clients attending a Community Drug and Alcohol Team service took part in structured interviews about their previous attempts to stop using amphetamine. Thirty three had made a total of 47 attempts at self detoxication; 15 had undergone enforced withdrawal and ten had previously sought medical treatment. A total of 86% of subjects described significant withdrawal symptoms on stopping use of amphetamines. Increased use of other drugs was commonly reported as a means of coping with withdrawal, psycho-social techniques being used less systematically. The implications for the provision of attractive, effective treatments are discussed.
Low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia is associated with increasing circuit concentrations of compound A, which is nephrotoxic in rats, but the effect of compound A and low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia on renal function in humans is unclear. The authors compared the effects of high- and low-flow sevoflurane and isoflurane anesthesia on renal function and on several possible markers of nephrotoxicity in humans.
Forty-two patients without preexisting renal disease underwent either low-flow isoflurane (1 l/min, n = 14), low-flow sevoflurane (1 l/min, n 14), or high-flow sevoflurane (6 l/min, n = 14) anesthesia for body-surface-area surgery scheduled to last at least 4 h. Twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), beta2-microglobulin, protein, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine concentrations were measured before and after anesthesia.
There were no differences in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and creatinine clearance among the three groups after anesthesia. Increased urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase excretions were seen in the low-flow and high-flow sevoflurane groups, but not in the low-flow isoflurane group (P < 0.01). Ten patients in the low-flow sevoflurane group had 24-h urinary excretion of protein that exceeded the normal ranges after anesthesia, but only one patient in the isoflurane and none in the high-flow sevoflurane groups had this.
Low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia was associated with mild and transient proteinuria. However, the observed proteinuria was not associated with any changes in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and creatinine clearance in these patients with no preexisting renal disease.
