To elucidate the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) after zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice.
Prospective controlled laboratory study on zymosan-induced generalized inflammation in mice. Over < or =28 days, a single intraperitoneal administration of zymosan induced a three-phase illness in C57BL mice, rendering them very ill with MODS-like symptoms from day 7 onward. Additionally, the same experiment was performed on C57BL/6 TNF-Rc-p55 knockout mice to elucidate the role of TNF and its receptor p55.
Animal research laboratory.
Inbred C57BL mice and C57BL p55-/- mice received a single sterile intraperitoneal injection of zymosan suspended in paraffin oil (0.75 mg/g of body weight).
The animals were monitored for survival, condition, and body weight for < or =28 days. At 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after zymosan administration, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and lungs and livers were extracted for isolation of RNA and histopathologic evaluation. Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) in the respective organs. Both animal strains went through initial shock with a high mortality rate during the first 3 days. The C57BL mice developed MODS with typical symptoms and histopathologic results correlating with excessive TNF-alpha mRNA expression from day 7 onward. In contrast, no disease, histopathologic changes, nor TNF-alpha mRNA expression in liver or lung was found within the TNF-Rc-p55-/- mice.
Organ-derived TNF-alpha plays a crucial role in the development of MODS in this murine model.
Propranolol (240 mg daily) and verapamil (360 mg daily) were objectively compared for their respective efficacy in the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. Twenty-two patients were studied in a randomized placebo controlled, double-blind crossover trial with 4 weeks on each active drug treatment. Multistage treadmill exercise with computer-assisted ECG analysis was performed after 2 weeks on placebo and at the end of each 4-week active drug treatment. The mean exercise time to produce angina was 5.5 minutes (SEM +/- 0.4 minutes) on placebo and this increased to 7.8 (+/- 0.5) minutes on propranolol and 9.1 (+/- 0.5) minutes on verapamil. The improvement in exercise time of verapamil over propranolol was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Ten patients became free of angina with verapamil and four with propranolol. Resting and maximal exercise heart rates were significantly reduced by propranolol; verapamil did not reduce the maximal heart rate but reduced the resting heart rate slightly. However, the heart rate increase per minute of exercise was significantly diminished (p less than 0.001). ST segment changes showed improvement with both drugs despite marked differences in heart rate profile. The overall efficacy of the slow calcium channel blocker, verapamil, compares favorably with that of a standard beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug (propranolol), thus providing a new perspective in the management of angina pectoris. These two classes of drugs seem to act by different mechanisms and it is suggested that if patients are resistant or intolerant to one of these drugs, the other can be used to yield a beneficial response.
It has been shown in experiments on mice that repeated administration of haloperidol (20 days) in doses of 0.1 and 5.0 mg/kg provoked an increase in the tolerance to the drug cataleptic effect. When administered in a higher dose (5.0 mg/kg), the drug increased 3H-spiroperidol binding with the striatal membranes 72 hours after withdrawal. Repeated administration of apomorphine in doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg combined with haloperidol antagonized the development of the tolerance and reduced the hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors, observed after withdrawal of haloperidol in a dose of 5.0 mg/kg. The low apomorphine dose also potentiated the haloperidol-induced catalepsy.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adult patients is often resistant to current therapy, making the development of novel therapeutic agents paramount. We investigated whether mTOR inhibitors (MTIs), a class of signal transduction inhibitors, would be effective in primary human ALL. Lymphoblasts from adult patients with precursor B ALL were cultured on bone marrow stroma and were treated with CCI-779, a second generation MTI. Treated cells showed a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptotic cells, compared to untreated cells. We also assessed the effect of CCI-779 in a NOD/SCID xenograft model. We treated a total of 68 mice generated from the same patient samples with CCI-779 after establishment of disease. Animals treated with CCI-779 showed a decrease in peripheral-blood blasts and in splenomegaly. In dramatic contrast, untreated animals continued to show expansion of human ALL. We performed immunoblots to validate the inhibition of the mTOR signaling intermediate phospho-S6 in human ALL, finding down-regulation of this target in xenografted human ALL exposed to CCI-779. We conclude that MTIs can inhibit the growth of adult human ALL and deserve close examination as therapeutic agents against a disease that is often not curable with current therapy.
Different dose regimens of medetomidine (a potent alpha 2-adrenergic agonist), adding up to a combined dose of 80 micrograms/kg, were administered to laboratory beagles to determine physiologic responses including neurologic. The study was intended to determine EEG responses where sufficient sedative and analgesic effects are reached with medetomidine and in contrast its effects when used with ketamine or halothane. Cardiopulmonary responses were very similar in each dose regimen, showing the characteristic properties of single doses of 80 micrograms/kg of medetomidine. Effective sedative and analgesic duration seemed to be a function of when the largest dose was administered. Adequate additional sedative and analgesic could be gained from injections at doses of half of the initial one. The potent sedative and analgesic effects of medetomidine confirmed by neurologic evaluation supports its potential use as a premedication to general anesthesia in dogs. In this study, 2 different doses of medetomidine were also tested as premedication to both ketamine HCI and halothane anesthesia. Neorologic responses were determined at the same time cardiopulmonary parameters, anesthetic quality, and dose requirements were recorded. Medetomidine was found to have favorable qualities in conjunction with these anesthetics. Cardiopulmonary parameters remained satisfactory in both groups as preanesthetic medication prior to halothane, but no additional benefits could be seen from doses of 40 micrograms/kg medetomidine compared to 20 micrograms/kg, except a significant 30% reduction in halothane requirement. The positive chronotropic and inotropic properties of ketamine restored the medetomidine-induced bradycardia and produced a short anesthetic period of 15 to 30 min depending on the dose of medetomidine. The quality of anesthesia was better when 40 micrograms/kg medetomidine was used, but recovery was quicker with 20 micrograms/kg medetomidine. Medetomidine significantly reduced cerebral activity as demonstrated by recordings of total amplitude and frequency evaluation of the EEG with compressed spectral analysis. This analytical method was effective in confirming clinical signs of sedation, analgesia, and anesthesia in canine subjects.
To date, there is no medication specifically approved for cocaine addiction. Agonist medications are used clinically in the treatment of other addictions, which suggests that this method of drug therapy could potentially be successful in treating cocaine addiction as well.
The objective of this study was to determine the effect of extended D-amphetamine treatment on responding on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule reinforced by cocaine.
Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.19, 0.38, 0.75, or 1.5 mg/kg/injection) or food on a PR schedule. After stable baseline breakpoints (the number of reinforcers earned in one session) were established over 3 days, animals were implanted with osmotic mini-pumps that continuously delivered D-amphetamine (5 mg/kg/day) for a duration of either 7 or 14 days. Breakpoints were then determined during and/or after this treatment period.
Rats demonstrated dose-dependent decreases in cocaine-reinforced responding over the D-amphetamine treatment period. Breakpoints for doses of 0.75 mg/kg/injection and below decreased significantly when compared to baseline and remained decreased for up to 14 days after mini-pump removal, whereas those for the highest dose of cocaine remained unchanged. Additionally, D-amphetamine treatment during a 14-day abstinence period from cocaine self-administration had no effect on breakpoints when tested the day after mini-pump removal.
These data suggest that the reduction in cocaine-reinforced responding after continuous D-amphetamine treatment cannot be accounted for by tolerance alone. Instead, the roles of learning and the interaction between cocaine and D-amphetamine must be considered and examined in future studies.
A simple and accurate device for recording tremor intensity in unanaesthetized and unrestrained rats is described. The physical measures of tremor are shown to have several advantages over previous devices. First, the new apparatus, unlike some earlier ones, does not restrict the animal's movements to an unusually small cage, with weighty mechanical devices or with electrical leads. Second, most earlier methods for measuring tremor use a subjective rating scale. However, the present method uses objective and reliable measures. In a double-blind, illustrative experiment involving complete crossover, Wistar rats were randomly injected IP with physostigmine in doses of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mg/kg or the corresponding amount of 0.9% NaCl solution as control. The recorded tremor intensity showed a clear dose-response relationship for physostigmine. Moreover, linear regression of the dose-response relationship showed that tremor intensity increased linearly with increasing doses of physostigmine. The cholinergic antagonist atropine (0.3 mg/kg SC) antagonized physostigmine-induced tremor, whereas methylatropine (0.3 mg/kg SC) tended to potentiate it. These results show that the technique described is suitable for quantification of tremor intensity in rats and for testing drug interactions on physostigmine-induced tremor.
Chronic treatment with the mu-opioid receptor agonist, buprenorphine, reduces cocaine-induced behaviors in rats with a history of cocaine self-administration. The mechanisms underlying these actions of buprenorphine remain unclear.
The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of chronic buprenorphine treatment on cocaine-induced activity and levels of glutamate and dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in rats that were preexposed to cocaine or drug-naïve.
In experiment 1, basal levels of NAc glutamate were assessed using in vivo microdialysis in cocaine-naïve rats that were treated chronically with buprenorphine (3.0 mg/kg per day) via osmotic minipumps or that underwent sham surgery. In experiment 2, rats were preexposed to seven daily injections of cocaine or saline. After a 12-16-day drug-free period, extracellular levels of NAc glutamate and DA and locomotor activity were assessed simultaneously, before and after an acute injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), in rats under sham and chronic buprenorphine (3.0 mg/kg per day) treatment.
Chronic buprenorphine treatment increased basal levels of glutamate in drug-naïve and cocaine-preexposed rats, blocked the expression of locomotor sensitization to cocaine, and potentiated the NAc DA response to acute cocaine in cocaine-preexposed rats.
These findings suggest that buprenorphine may block the expression of cocaine sensitization and other cocaine-related behaviors by increasing basal levels of glutamate in the NAc, which would serve to decrease the effectiveness of cocaine or cocaine-associated cues.
We examined the direct effect of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) on levodopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesia in 45 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) without reducing the levodopa dosage during the early period after surgery. In 8 patients (18%), the dyskinesia was quickly attenuated by bipolar stimulation in an experimental trial (5 min) with the contacts placed within the area above the STN. In contrast, bipolar stimulation using contacts placed within the STN itself tended to provoke or exacerbate the dyskinesia, indicating that dyskinesia could be inhibited by stimulation of the areas above the STN rather than the STN itself. In an attempt to control the cardinal symptoms of PD and dyskinesia at the same time, we employed bipolar stimulation with a longer interpolar distance as a therapeutic procedure (2 weeks), using contacts within the STN as a cathode and contacts within the area above the STN as an anode. Bilateral STN-DBS significantly attenuated the dyskinesia as evaluated by the dyskinesia severity rating scale (p < 0.05). In 24 patients (53%), almost complete control of the dyskinesia was observed. The contacts used as an anode in these patients were located more dorsally compared to those of the remaining patients, suggesting again that the dyskinesia was inhibited by stimulation of the areas above the STN rather than the STN itself. In the area above the STN, pallidothalamic, pallidosubthalamic and subthalamopallidal fibers are densely distributed. It appears that stimulation of these fibers may cause effects similar to thalamic or pallidal DBS and therefore inhibit peak-dose dyskinesia. Bipolar STN-DBS with contacts placed within the area above the STN as an anode appears to represent a useful option for controlling both the cardinal symptoms of PD and peak-dose dyskinesia at the same time.
Two cases are presented which illustrate the dangers inherent in utilizing a polypharmacy approach in treating children with psychotropic medication. In each case, severe adverse effects, including cognitive and mood deterioration, were experienced by the child when treated with a combination of methylphenidate and imipramine. Possible mechanisms at the neurotransmitter level are described as postulated determinants for this pharmacological interaction.
The ability of 1,6-dinitropyrene and 1,8-dinitropyrene to induce chromosome aberrations has been examined in a rat epithelial cell line (RL4). Both compounds were found to be potent clastogenic agents in these cells, inducing predominantly chromatid type abberations. The number of aberrant metaphases was dose-related up to 1.25 micrograms/ml, after which the response showed a plateau at a frequency of around 60%. The number of chromatid gaps per 100 cells also increased linearly with concentration from 3.5 in the control cultures up to 117 with 1,6-DNP (1.25 micrograms/ml) and 98 with 1,8-DNP (2.5 micrograms/ml), indicating that the induction of chromatid gaps was a valid and sensitive measure of chromosome damage in this cell line. The fact that a positive result as obtained in RL4 cells implies that these cells contain enzyme systems which are capable of converting dinitropyrenes to a mutagenic form.
The more effective bioactive peptides which can be efficiently prepared with low cost and high yield are in great demand for the development of therapeutic peptides. In this study, Pro-Pro-[Arg(11)]hPTH(1-34)-Pro-Pro-Asp (hPTH'), an analog of human parathyroid hormone (1-34) [hPTH(1-34)], was prepared by an efficiently cost-effective preparation strategy. It was repeated eight times on the gene level and expressed in the form of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Following some primary purifications, the inclusion bodies of octapeptide repeats were hydrolyzed into hPTH' monomers by hydrochloric acid. After further purified by a CM52 chromatographic column, hPTH' reached a yield of 16.9% and output of 61 mg/l medium. Furthermore, we compared anabolic effects between hPTH' and hPTH(1-34) on ovariectomized rats. The results indicated that hPTH' led to more significant increments in bone material density (BMD), trabecular width and bone formation marker as well as less loss in marrow space area than what hPTH(1-34) did. In addition, the active form of hPTH' was introduced by the excision with dipeptidyl peptidase IV in vivo. These results suggest that hPTH' is more effective than hPTH(1-34) in stimulating bone formation and improving skeletal microarchitecture. We can conclude that hPTH' is potentially a more effective therapeutical agent on osteoporosis.
Generalized lymphedema is an extremely rare effect of sirolimus therapy in renal transplant recipients. We describe the development of this complication in a 56-yr-old woman, who was given an experimental protocol with cyclosporine, sirolimus, steroids, and basiliximab. Following the protocol, after one month, the patient was randomized to the "sirolimus only" group, while cyclosporine was completely suspended and the oral steroids were continued. Three months later, the patient was admitted for severe lymphedema of the lower limbs, with significant weight increase, massive ascites and dyspnea, but excellent renal function. A chest radiography and an ultrasound study of the heart showed a moderate pleural and pericardial effusion. An abdominal ultrasound scan showed two small lymphoceles next to the transplanted kidney, confirmed with a CT scan. After sirolimus discontinuation the generalized lymphedema started to improve and three months later all the symptoms had disappeared.
The utilization of dual maintenance therapy with tacrolimus and sirolimus (the Edmonton protocol) has been widely adopted as standard immunosuppression for islet cell transplantation. This immunosuppression regimen has numerous toxicities including renal dysfunction, anemia, and recurrent aphthous ulcers. We present a case of a 63-yr-old Caucasian female who received an isolated islet transplant. Over the first six months post-transplant, the patient developed severe anemia, intractable aphthous ulcers, and renal dysfunction. Islet transplant function was excellent and the patient is insulin-independent since the end of the second month post-transplant. However, because of the above toxicities, a decision was made to change her immunosuppression regimen eight months post-transplant to low dose tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and a monthly maintenance infusion of daclizumab. Since then, her aphthous ulcers have disappeared, renal function has improved, and islet cell function remains stable.
Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a member of hedgehog (hh) family of signaling molecules, is necessary for normal axial patterning and cellular differentiation in the developing central nervous system. Shh also promotes the survival of fetal dopaminergic neurons and protects cultures of fetal midbrain dopaminergic neurons from the toxic effects of N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), a neurotoxin that selectively injures nigral dopaminergic neurons. The mRNA expression of Shh and its putative receptor in the adult brain indicates an important role of Shh in the mature nervous system in addition to its roles during embryogenesis. In this study we examined the behavioral and anatomical effects of intrastriatal injection of singly myristoylated wild-type human Sonic hedgehog N-terminal fragment (Shh-M) in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Five groups of rats received a series of four intrastriatal injections of Shh-M (180 ng, 540 ng, or 4.275 microg per injection), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (1 microg/injection), or vehicle on days 1, 3, 5, and 8. On day 4, the animals received an intrastriatal injection of 15 microg 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) free base. Intrastriatal administration of Shh (180 ng/injection) twice before and after a single intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA reduced apomorphine- and amphetamine-induced rotation and forelimb akinesia and partially preserved dopaminergic axons in the striatum. This is the first demonstration in vivo that Shh reduces behavioral deficits induced by intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesion and suggests that Shh may be useful in the treatment of disorders that affect the nigrostriatal system, such as PD.
Paliperidone extended-release tablet (paliperidone ER) is a centrally active dopamine D(2)- and serotonergic 5-HT(2A)-receptor antagonist that is registered for the treatment of schizophrenia. The controlled rate of release of paliperidone from the ER formulation is designed to have a slower absorption rate, which results in gradual ascending plasma concentrations with observed maximum plasma concentrations occurring at 24 hours after dosing on the first dosing day. On subsequent treatment days, the ER formulation provides minimal fluctuations in plasma concentrations. Paliperidone is eliminated with a terminal half-life of approximately 24 hours. Steady state is achieved after 4 daily doses. Paliperidone ER exhibits time-invariant pharmacokinetics. It shows a 3.5-fold accumulation upon steady state, mainly caused by the controlled release characteristics of the formulation. Paliperidone ER displays dose proportionality over the dose range of 3 to 15 mg; the 90% confidence intervals of the pairwise dose comparisons are all included in the 80% to 125% bioequivalence limits.
A prior report described the presentation of cocaine-induced trichotillomania, which resolved with the cessation of cocaine use. Here the authors describe the case of stimulant-induced trichotillomania that resolved with the discontinuation of stimulants and initiation of olanzapine. To the authors' knowledge this is the first reported adult case of stimulant-induced trichotillomania. The case is of a patient with a previous diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder whose symptoms of trichotillomania coincide with abuse of amphetamine and with the resolution of symptoms in the absence of amphetamine use. Given the increase in exposure of prescription amphetamines among adults, further study into the association between stimulants and adverse events such as trichotillomania is needed.
A case-control study was designed to investigate a chemical accident that occurred in a swimming-pool in the summer of 2005. The aim was to describe the environmental factors involved in the accident, to assess the effect of chlorine gas on the respiratory system, and to perform a clinical and spirometric follow-up. The following interventions were carried out: environmental inspection, epidemiologic survey (including sociodemographic variables), location at the time of the accident, perception of an abnormal smell, and clinical and spirometric outcomes to assess respiratory function. Sixty-five cases and 48 controls were identified and interviewed. The accident was produced by accidental admixture of hydrochloric acid with sodium hypochlorite resulting in chlorine gas release. The main clinical symptoms were dyspnea and cough. The risk of becoming ill was 10-fold higher in children with a previous lung disease and was 4-fold higher when the distance from the chlorine source was less than 40 m. All cases recovered completely, except one who had a history of asthma.
Pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators have been involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Tigecycline (Tig), a glycylcycline antibiotic and an analog of Minocycline, is shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects that are distinct from its anti-microbial activity. Its neuroprotective mechanism is unknown. In this study, we investigated the direct protective mechanisms of tigecycline against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The results showed that tigecycline significantly attenuated the expression and the release of nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), as well as nitric oxide (NO) levels in LPS-induced PC12 cells. In addition, tigecycline dose-dependently decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity. This later finding corroborated the results of decreased pro-apoptotic Bad, and increased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression thus, confirming a neuroprotective effect of the drug in differentiated PC12 cells induced with LPS. The findings of our study suggest new targets for tigecycline and support the potential for tigecycline to be investigated as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders.
We treated with nifedipine or lisinopril 38 essential hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. The study had a single-blind crossover design; nifedipine or lisinopril was given for the first 24 weeks, and then patients were crossed over to the other antihypertensive agent for another 24 weeks. Both nifedipine and lisinopril significantly decreased mean arterial pressure to the same extent. Although lisinopril decreased left ventricular mass index more rapidly than nifedipine, 48 weeks of antihypertensive treatment with nifedipine or lisinopril reduced the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy to the same level. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy may be mainly due to a reduction in mean arterial pressure during the 24-week nifedipine treatment and due to an improvement of aortic compliance during the lisinopril treatment. Both nifedipine and lisinopril are effective in the reversal of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy; however, the agents have disparate actions on hemodynamic factors.
One component of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) facial phenotype is a frontonasal anomaly characterized by a thin upper lip and a smooth philtrum. The expression of this anomaly can diminish with age and occurs infrequently in prenatal alcohol-exposed individuals. This study sought to explain these observations. Standardized craniofacial cephalograms of 18 nonhuman primates exposed weekly to ethanol or sucrose solution in utero were measured at ages 1, 6, 12, and 24 months to assess skeletal changes in craniofacial form with age, cognition, and timing of ethanol exposure. The data suggest that there may be a critical period for induction of alcohol-induced craniofacial alterations that occurs very early in gestation and is very short in duration (gestational days 19 or 20). The alterations were scarcely detectable at age 1 month, were most prominent at 6 months, and diminished progressively at 12 and 24 months in the macaque. The appearance and disappearance of the thin upper lip and smooth philtrum may be explained by underlying changes in skeletal structure with age. The infrequent occurrence of the FAS frontonasal anomaly may be explained, in part, by its short critical period of induction.
This is a case report of immediate acute pulmonary edema following the intravenous administration of Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (glycyrrhizin) and Chlor-Trimeton (chlorpheniramine maleate). The patient was a 15-year-old Japanese boy who had a previous history of surgery for right testicular tumor and adverse reactions to contrast media. The patient complained of severe headache, nausea, and vomiting just before the end of intravenous administration of these drugs, which were being given to prevent an adverse reaction to contrast enhanced CT. The symptoms disappeared within a few minutes, but chest CT examination performed immediately after the onset of the adverse reaction showed ill-defined consolidations with air bronchogram, especially in the anterior portion of both lungs. One day later, the abnormalities coalesced and poorly marginated patchy opacities developed. A week later, the abnormal densities disappeared. CT findings suggested acute pulmonary edema, especially in the anterior portion of both lungs. Thus CT examination was useful to detect focal pulmonary edema even in a patient with no particular respiratory symptom.
The healing activity of malabaricone B and malabaricone C, the major antioxidant constituents of the spice Myristica malabarica against the indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration in mice has been studied. The histological indices revealed maximum ulceration on the 3rd day after indomethacin administration, which was effectively healed by malabaricone B, malabaricone C (each 10 mg/kg body weight/day) and omeprazole (3 mg/kg body weight/day) for 3 days. Compared to the untreated ulcerated mice, treatment with malabaricone B, malabaricone C and omeprazole reduced the ulcer indices by 60.3% (P<0.01), 88.4% and 86.1% respectively (P<0.001). All the test samples accelerated ulcer healing than observed in natural recovery even after 7 days. Stomach ulceration reduced the total antioxidant status of plasma by 41% (P<0.05), which was significantly increased by malabaricone B (36%, P<0.01), malabaricone C (61%, P<0.001) and omeprazole (53%, P<0.001). Compared to the ulcerated untreated mice, those treated with malabaricone B reduced the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and protein carbonyls by 17% and approximately 34% respectively (P<0.05), while malabaricone C and omeprazole reduced the parameters almost equally (approximately 30%, P<0.01, and approximately 40%, P<0.01 respectively). Likewise, all the test samples reduced the oxidation of protein and non-protein thiols significantly (P<0.05). The antioxidant activity of the test samples could partly account their healing capacities. However, the differential potency of them was explainable by considering their relative abilities to modulate mucin secretion, PGE(2) synthesis and expression of EGF receptor and COX isoforms, malabaricone C being most effective in controlling all these factors.
Antioxidant therapy protects against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity in animal models. A clinically suitable antioxidant must not affect the therapeutic efficacy of aminoglycosides or exhibit any side effects of its own. In addition, the treatment should be inexpensive and convenient in order to be implemented in developing countries where the use of aminoglycosides is most common. Standardized Salviae miltiorrhizae extracts (Danshen) are used clinically in China and contain diterpene quinones and phenolic acids with antioxidant properties. We combined in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the effect of a clinically approved injectable Danshen solution on aminoglycoside-induced free radical generation and ototoxicity. In vitro, Danshen inhibited gentamicin-dependent lipid peroxidation (formation of conjugated dienes from arachidonic acid), as well as the gentamicin-catalyzed formation of superoxide (in a lucigenin-based chemiluminescence assay) and hydroxyl radicals (oxidation of N,N-dimethyl-p-nitrosoaniline). Danshen extracts were then administered to adult CBA mice receiving concurrent treatment with kanamycin (700 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for 15 days). Auditory threshold shifts induced by kanamycin (approximately 50 dB) were significantly attenuated. Danshen did not reduce the levels in serum or antibacterial efficacy of kanamycin. These results suggest that herbal medications may be a significantly underexplored source of antidotes for aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Such traditional medicines are widely used in many developing countries and could become an easily accepted and inexpensive protective therapy.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, is essential for adipogenesis. PPARgamma is recognized as a major target for the insulin-sensitizing effects of the thiazolidinediones. Previous studies have demonstrated that heterozygous PPARgamma-deficient mice are protected from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced adipocyte hypertrophy, obesity and insulin resistance, which suggests that PPARgamma may have a pivotal role in adipocyte hypertrophy, obesity and insulin resistance. In this study, we generated transgenic mice with the gain-of-function PPARgamma Ser112Ala mutation (S112A mice) using the aP2 promoter, to elucidate the impact of increased PPARgamma activity in mature adipocytes. Despite a 2-3-fold increase in the adipocyte PPARgamma2 gene expression and PPARgamma activity, the S112A mice showed comparable adiposity and insulin sensitivity to wild-type mice under both normal and HFD conditions. Although the expression levels of the PPARgamma target genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as aP2 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, were upregulated in the white adipose tissue of the S112A mice, the serum levels of free fatty acid, triglyceride, adiponectin and leptin, as well as the oxygen consumption, were comparable between the wild-type and S112A mice under the HFD condition. Moreover, treatment with rosiglitazone ameliorated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance to a similar degree in the two genotypes under the HFD condition. In conclusion, whereas the 50% decrease in PPAR gamma activity showed protection from HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance, in the present study, the 2-3-fold increase in PPARgamma2 expression and PPARgamma activity failed to show obesity and insulin resistance even under the HFD condition.
