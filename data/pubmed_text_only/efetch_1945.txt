The mycotoxin ochratoxin A is a contaminant of human and animal food products. It is a potent nephrotoxin known to damage the proximal tubule. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of ochratoxin A on a porcine renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1), and to identify sensitive endpoints revealing damage at the epithelial barrier level and at the molecular level. Cells exposed for 24 h to 5-10 microM ochratoxin indicated a clear damage to the intactness of the epithelial barrier, as shown by measurements of trans-epithelial resistance and zonula occludens-1 protein expression. At the mitochondrial level we observed alterations of the normal functions, such as an increase of the membrane potential, the formation of straight extensions, and the formation of giant mitochondria. At higher ochratoxin concentrations (50 microM), at which cytotoxicity assays revealed a significant toxicity, alterations of the cytoskeleton organization and induction of apoptosis were evident. In addition, we analyzed the expression of genes by using a cDNA macroarray. Our data indicate that ochratoxin-induced nephrotoxicity can be detected at the barrier and at the mitochondrial level at rather low concentrations, at which conventional cytotoxicity assays are unable to reveal toxic effects.
Minocycline hydrochloride is a tetracycline derivative that has been advocated as the drug of choice in the treatment of meningococcal carriers. Recently, we studied a group of 30 patients who experienced a large number of side-effects after receiving minocycline for treatment of meningococcal meningitis. Twenty-seven of 30 (90%) suffered from dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, weakness, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms appeared within the first 72 hours of taking minocycline, and disappeared within 48 hours of stopping the medication.
Tobacco smoking and occupational exposure are major risk factors of bladder cancer via exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aromatic amines, which lead to oxidative stress and DNA damage. Several enzymes, which play key roles in oxidative stress are polymorphic in humans. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) produces a strong oxidant for microbicidal activity, and activates carcinogens in tobacco smoke. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyzes the methylation of endo- and xenobiotics and prevents redox cycling. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinoid compounds, which also protects cells from redox cycling. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protects cells from free radical injury. To test the hypothesis that the risk of bladder cancer can be influenced by polymorphisms in the genes that modulate oxidative stress, in particular by interacting with environmental carcinogens, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study among men in Brescia, Northern Italy. We recruited and interviewed 201 incident cases and 214 controls from 1997 to 2000. Occupational exposures to PAHs and aromatic amines were coded blindly by occupational physicians. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression was applied to model the association between genetic polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk and the effect of modifications of smoking and occupational exposures were evaluated. MPO G-463A homozygous variant was associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer with an OR of 0.31 (95% CI = 0.12-0.80). MnSOD Val/Val genotype increased the risk of bladder cancer with OR of 1.91 (95% CI = 1.20-3.04), and there was a combined effect with smoking (OR = 7.20, 95% CI = 3.23-16.1) and PAH (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.35-6.74). We did not observe an effect of COMT Val108Met polymorphism. These findings suggest that individual susceptibility of bladder cancer may be modulated by MPO and MnSOD polymorphisms, and that the combination of genetic factors involved in oxidative stress response with environmental carcinogens may play an important role in bladder carcinogenesis.
In the present study, the effects of 1-(beta-naphthylmethyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (YS 51), a positional isomer of 1-(alpha-naphthylmethyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (YS 49), on nitric oxide production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression were investigated in RAW 264.7 cells, mouse monocyte macrophage, exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon (IFN)-gamma. In addition, the effects of YS 51 on vascular reactivity in vitro and ex vivo, iNOS protein expression (rat lung) and survival rate (mice), were also investigated in LPS-treated rodents. Treatment with YS 51 reduced not only nitric oxide production (IC(50), 23.5 microM), but also expression of iNOS mRNA in RAW 264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation of rat endothelium-denuded thoracic aorta with LPS (300 ng/ml) for 8 h in vitro resulted in suppression of vasoconstrictor effects to phenylephrine, which was restored by coincubation with YS 51. Treatment with YS 51 before (30 min) injection of LPS resulted in significant reduction of the expression of iNOS protein in rat lung tissue and restored the vascular contractility to 9,11-dideoxy-11alpha,9alpha-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F(2alpha) (U46619), ex vivo. The plasma concentration of nitrite/nitrate (NOx) level was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced by YS 51 (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p) in LPS-treated (10 mg/kg, i.p) rats. Furthermore, YS 51 significantly increased the survival rate in LPS-injected mice. In RAW 264.7 cells, YS 51 inhibited the formation of nuclear factor-kappaB-DNA complex and iNOS promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that iNOS gene expression was modified transcriptionally by YS 51. These data strongly suggest that YS 51, a positional isomer of YS 49, might be beneficial in septic shock and/or endotoxin-induced inflammatory disorders.
To test the efficacy of sublingual nitroglycerin as a bronchodilator, we studied ten patients with acute asthma. After a baseline spirogram, each patient was given 1.2 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin, and subsequent spirograms were obtained a five-minute intervals for 15 minutes. Each patient was then given three subsequent doses of epinephrine (0.5 mg) subcutaneously at 15-minute intervals. Spirograms were obtained 15 minutes after each epinephrine dose. Forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) did not change significantly following sublingual nitroglycerin, but both FEV1 and FVC improved significantly after epinephrine administration. Three patients experienced transient but severe hypotension after receiving sublingual nitroglycerin. The results suggest that sublingual nitroglycerin is not adequate initial therapy for asthmatic attacks and that the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin in acute asthma may be dangerous.
In confirmation of an earlier study, it was found that in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni hepatocellular carcinomas are induced by hycanthone, an antischistosomal drug and potent frameshift mutagen. In addition, a high incidence 1) of micronodular hepatocellular whirling lesions with increased basophilia, 2) of other proliferative areas of altered cellularity and 3) of precancerous nodules was found in the livers of schistosome-infected mice treated with hycanthone. A dosage schedule of hycanthone which was too small to have any significant chemotherapeutic effect in mice (3 X 3 mg/kg) was sufficient to induce a statistically highly significant incidence of micronodular lesions and of precancerous nodules. Hence, the hepatic tissue proved more susceptible to low doses of this drug than the parasite. No significant hepatocarcinogenic effects or other hepatocellular changes were induced by chemotherapeutically effective doses of two related equipotent antischistosomal compounds, a chloroindazole analog of hycanthone, IA-4, and the tetrahydroquinoline derivative, oxamniquine.
The hypotensive and negative chronotropic effects of 5 calcium entry blockers (verapamil 200 micrograms/kg IV; diltiazem 300 micrograms/kg IV; nifedipine 5 micrograms/kg IV; nicardipine 50 micrograms/kg IV; and bepridil 5 mg/kg IV) were compared in control normotensive and acute neurogenic hypertensive anaesthetized dogs. Acute neurogenic hypertension was induced by sino-aortic denervation (SAD). In control normotensive dogs, all drugs (except bepridil) induced a slight and transient decrease in blood pressure. Nifedipine and nicardipine increased heart rate whereas the three other drugs remained ineffective. SAD caused a 2-2.5-fold increase in the hypotensive properties of the 5 drugs in dogs. Moreover, the duration of this induced hypotension was longer than in control normotensive animals. In SAD dogs, all calcium entry blockers significantly decreased heart rate. This study indicates that the direct cardiac inhibitory action of calcium channel blockers is modulated by baroreceptor activity in intact animals. The mechanism of the selective action of calcium entry blockers in hypertensive SAD in contrast to normotensive dogs is discussed.
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare but severe complication of neoplastic disease as well as some of its treatments. The pathophysiology of HUS is poorly understood, but it affects multiple organ systems and carries a high mortality rate. The diagnosis of HUS is based on a clinical triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, for which no proven therapies exist. This report describes a case of HUS developing in a patient with stage IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix following treatment with cisplatin/bleomycin/vincristine neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radiation therapy.
Two childhood acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients receiving intrathecal (IT) and intravenous (IV) cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) developed progressive ascending paralysis, resulting in death in one patient. Necropsy findings on this patient included spinal cord demyelination characteristic of Ara-C neurotoxicity. An unusual aspect of these two cases was the delay between cessation of IT therapy and the onset of neurologic symptoms. These patients received relatively low total doses of IT Ara-C and standard doses of IV Ara-C. Previous studies have shown that Ara-C equilibrates readily between serum and cerebrospinal fluid; this implies that total IV and IT doses of Ara-C may be additive in relation to development of neurotoxicity. For these reasons, use of IV and IT Ara-C in childhood AML must be approached with greater caution, especially if neurologic abnormalities develop during or after therapy.
Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) has become the first choice in the management of deleterious spasticity that does not respond to oral and intramuscular medications following spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and cerebral palsy. The usefulness of ITB in severe spastic hemiparesis following stroke is studied.
A total of 8 patients underwent clinical and video assessment following ITB bolus application (n=5) and during continuous infusion via a temporary catheter system (n=3).
The mean daily dosage alleviating spasticity on the hemiparetic side-without affecting the nonparetic side-was 119 microg/day (range 50 to 360 microg/day). However, 6 patients experienced functional deterioration as ITB weakened their paretic side such that the antigravity pattern they used for ambulation was suppressed. In 2 patients, spasticity-associated pain and spasms subsided and they underwent implantation of a long-term drug delivery system.
ITB may reduce spasticity in a dose-dependent manner irrespective of its origin. Although not primarily antinociceptive in humans, ITB may alleviate pain if arising from increased muscle tone. A functional benefit may result if ITB can uncover "subclinical" motor control that had been suppressed by spasticity. However, when a patient uses antigravity patterns for ambulation in the absence of more complex motor control, ITB may cause the loss of residual walking ability, which becomes a major limitation for patients with hemiplegic stroke.
A patient with an osteolytic L2-L3 pagetic block and pagetic lesions of L1 and the sacrum seen only as increased radionuclide activity became resistant to etidronate after the fifth course (5 mg/kg/d six months per year) and developed severe cauda equina syndrome (reduction in walking distance to 30 m and sphincter dysfunction) due primarily to vertebral hypertrophy. Five months after a ten-day course of intravenous pamidronate (22.5 mg/d), the clinical symptoms were unchanged, although the alkaline phosphatase level was down 50%. Oral clodronate (1,600 mg/day for six months per year) in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplementation dramatically improved the walking distance and sphincter disorders. Resolution of the neurological manifestations was complete after the second clodronate course. At last follow-up nine months after the fourth clodronate course, there was no evidence of a relapse and the alkaline phosphatase level was normal. The time course of events in this patient does not allow to affirm that pamidronate was ineffective and suggests that calcium and vitamin D supplementation improved mineralization of the pagetic block and enhanced the effect of bisphosphonate therapy.
Exposure to organophosphorus compounds, either pesticides or chemical warfare agents such as soman or sarin, represents a major health problem. Organophosphorus poisoning may induce seizures, status epilepticus and even brain lesions if untreated. Ketamine, an antagonist of glutamatergic receptors, was recently proved to be effective in combination with atropine sulfate as an anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant in mice and guinea pigs exposed to soman. Organophosphorus exposure may also occur in conditions of contemporary heat exposure. Since both MK-801, a more potent glutamatergic antagonist than ketamine, and atropine sulfate are detrimental for thermoregulation, we evaluated the pathophysiological consequences of ketamine/atropine combinations in a hot environment. Male wistar rats were exposed to 38°C ambient temperature and treated with atropine sulfate and/or ketamine (anesthetic and subanesthetic doses). The abdominal temperature and spontaneous locomotor activity were continuously monitored using telemetry. At the end of heat exposure, blood chemistry and the mRNA expression of some specific genes in the brain were assessed. Unlike MK-801, ketamine did not induce any deleterious effect on thermoregulation in rats. Conversely, atropine sulfate led to heatstroke and depressed the heat-induced blood corticosterone increase. Furthermore, it induced a dramatic increase in Hsp70 and c-Fos mRNA levels and a decrease in IκBα mRNA expression, both suggesting brain aggression. When combined with the anesthetic dose of ketamine, some of the atropine-induced metabolic disturbances were modified. In conclusion, ketamine can be used in hot environment and may even limit some of the biological alterations induced by atropine sulfate in these conditions.
The transmembrane glycoprotein osteoactivin is expressed in osteoblasts, dendritic cells and tumor cells. It is suggested to influence osteoblast maturation, cell adhesion and migration. We studied osteoactivin expression within the liver.
Expression of osteoactivin was analysed by RT-PCR, Northern blotting, in situ hybridisation (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) comparing normal and acutely injured rat liver [induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) administration], liver cell populations, and normal or diseased human liver.
By ISH osteoactivin expression was detected in sinusoid-lining cells found by IHC to be positive for the common mononuclear phagocyte marker antibody anti-CD68. While total liver contained only traces, isolated Kupffer cells expressed abundant amounts of osteoactivin mRNA further increasing during culture. In acutely injured rat liver osteoactivin expression was strongly increased reaching maximum of expression 48h after CCl(4). By ISH osteoactivin expression was localised in pericentral inflammatory cells and sinusoid-lining cells again anti-CD68 positive. Dexamethasone and lipopolysaccharide decreased osteoactivin expression in cultured mononuclear phagocytes of normal as well as of acutely injured liver. In human liver osteoactivin was increased in fulminant hepatitis and paracetamol intoxication.
Osteoactivin is expressed at high levels in normal and inflammatory liver macrophages suggesting a significant role in acute liver injury.
The observation that fatalities from tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose are associated with heart block and/or arrhythmias has led to concern about the cardiovascular effects of TCAs. Contrary to expectations, studies have shown TCAs to be relatively safe in patients without heart disease. However, it is unclear whether these drugs are also safe in patients with heart disease. This prospective study compared the risk of cardiovascular complication at therapeutic plasma concentrations of TCAs in 196 depressed patients, 155 with normal electrocardiograms and 41 with either prolonged PR interval and/or bundle-branch block. The prevalence of second-degree atrioventricular block was significantly greater in patients with preexisting bundle-branch block (9%) than in patients with normal electrocardiograms (0.7%). Orthostatic hypotension occurred significantly more frequently with imipramine than with nortriptyline, and in patients with heart disease.
Vigabatrin is known to induce visual field defects in approximately one third of patients treated with the drug. It is apparent from electrophysiological studies that the cause of this defect is at retinal level probably as a result of the build up of GABA. Studies of electrophysiological retinal parameters such as the EOG and photopic, scotopic and 30-Hz flicker ERG have revealed changes in Arden Index, photopic a and b wave latency and amplitude, changes in oscillatory potentials, and changes in latency and amplitude of the 30Hz response. However, many of these changes such as the Arden Index, oscillatory potentials, latency and amplitude of photopic b wave appear to be related to current anti-epileptic drug treatment rather than visual field defects. Certain parameters, particularly the amplitude of the 30-Hz flicker response, do appear to correlate with the severity of the field defect. Paediatric patients treated with the drug at age 9 years or below cannot reliably perform visual field perimetry. To identify these patients a special VEP H-Stimulus has been developed to produce separate responses from central and peripheral field stimulation by alternating at slightly separate rates. Forty-five healthy children between ages 3 and 10 years have been used to develop a normal database. This technique has a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 87.5% in identifying the field defect and may be used in children with epilepsy from age 3 upwards.
Interleukin-6 stimulates liver regeneration and promotes hepatoprotection following experimental liver injury, but underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized. Because studies suggest matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) may promote liver injury, we examined whether IL-6 exerted its protective effects via regulation of MMP-2.
MMP-2 was analyzed in livers of IL-6-/- and IL-6+/+ mice following CCl(4) administration. IL-6-/- mice were pretreated with IL-6 and liver histology and MMP-2 expression were examined after liver injury. IL-6-/- mice were treated with an MMP-2 inhibitor and assessment of injury (histology and serum ALT levels), apoptosis by TUNEL assay, and hepatocyte proliferation by BRDU-labeling was performed. These studies were complemented by analysis of cultured stellate cells.
MMP-2 mRNA, protein, and activity was increased in IL-6-/- livers. Restoration of IL-6 signaling in IL-6-/- mice rescued injury and restored MMP-2 expression to wild-type levels. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of MMP-2 decreased hepatocellular injury and apoptosis in IL-6-/- mice. In cultured stellate cells, recombinant IL-6 suppressed endogenous MMP-2 mRNA and protein expression.
IL-6 may be hepatoprotective in acute injury through down-regulation of MMP-2. These findings suggest a role for MMP-2 in amplifying liver injury in vivo.
Advanced liver cirrhosis is associated with hyperdynamic circulation consisting of systemic hypotension, decreased peripheral resistance, and cardiac dysfunction, termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Previous studies have revealed the role of endocannabinoids and vascular CB(1) receptors in the development of generalized hypotension and mesenteric vasodilation in animal models of liver cirrhosis, and CB(1) receptors have also been implicated in the decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness of isolated heart tissue from cirrhotic rats. Here we document the cardiac contractile dysfunction in vivo in liver cirrhosis and explore the role of the endocannabinoid system in its development. Rats with CCl(4)-induced cirrhosis developed decreased cardiac contractility, as documented through the use of the Millar pressure-volume microcatheter system, low blood pressure, and tachycardia. Bolus intravenous injection of the CB(1) antagonist AM251 (3 mg/kg) acutely increased mean blood pressure, as well as both load-dependent and -independent indexes of systolic function, whereas no such changes were elicited by AM251 in control rats. Furthermore, tissue levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide increased 2.7-fold in the heart of cirrhotic compared with control rats, without any change in 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels, whereas, in the cirrhotic liver, both 2-arachidonoylglycerol (6-fold) and anandamide (3.5-fold) were markedly increased. CB(1)-receptor expression in the heart was unaffected by cirrhosis, as verified by Western blotting. Activation of cardiac CB(1) receptors by endogenous anandamide contributes to the reduced cardiac contractility in liver cirrhosis, and CB(1)-receptor antagonists may be used to improve contractile function in cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and, possibly, in other forms of heart failure.
Members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family of kinases (FGFR1-4) are dysregulated in multiple cancers. Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor being explored in a pivotal phase II trial in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia due to its potent activity against BCR-ABL. Ponatinib has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of all four FGFRs, prompting us to examine its potential as an FGFR inhibitor. In Ba/F3 cells engineered to express activated FGFR1-4, ponatinib potently inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling and viability with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L, with substantial selectivity over parental Ba/F3 cells. In a panel of 14 cell lines representing multiple tumor types (endometrial, bladder, gastric, breast, lung, and colon) and containing FGFRs dysregulated by a variety of mechanisms, ponatinib inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L and inhibited cell growth with GI(50) (concentration needed to reduce the growth of treated cells to half that of untreated cells) values of 7 to 181 nmol/L. Daily oral dosing of ponatinib (10-30 mg/kg) to mice reduced tumor growth and inhibited signaling in all three tumor models examined. Importantly, the potency of ponatinib in these models is similar to that previously observed in BCR-ABL-driven models and plasma levels of ponatinib that exceed the IC(50) values for FGFR1-4 inhibition can be sustained in patients. These results show that ponatinib is a potent pan-FGFR inhibitor and provide strong rationale for its evaluation in patients with FGFR-driven cancers.
Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is considered a safe drug for treatment of infectious bacterial diseases in children. Side-effects are rare and generally take the form of a hypersensitivity reaction to the sulphamethoxazole component of the drug. Hepatic injury usually presents as a transient elevation of liver enzymes, which is of little clinical relevance. Fulminant liver failure due to TMP-SMZ has been reported in only six adults and never in children. We here report a 5-year-old girl who developed fulminant liver failure 3 weeks after her third exposure to TMP-SMZ. After a biphasic clinical course she underwent successful liver transplantation.
Trimethoprim-Sulphamethoxazole may cause fulminant liver failure in children. The disease can run a biphasic clinical course and liver transplantation must be considered as the therapeutic option for these patients.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The evaluation of coronary artery disease by exercise stress testing is frequently limited by the patient's inability to exercise. Although pharmacologic stress testing with dobutamine is an alternative, the safety of dobutamine myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in the elderly has not been previously studied.
We studied the safety and feasibility of dobutamine (up to 40 microg/kg/min)-atropine (up to 1 mg) stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy using technetium single-photon emission CT imaging in 227 patients > or = 70 years old (mean +/- SD age, 75 +/- 4 years). A control group of 227 patients < 70 years old (mean age, 55 +/- 11 years; matched for gender, prevalence of previous infarction, beta-blocker therapy, and severity of resting perfusion abnormalities) was studied to assess age-related differences in the safety and the hemodynamic response. A feasible test was defined as the achievement of the target heart rate and/or an ischemic end point (angina, ST-segment depression, or reversible perfusion abnormalities).
No myocardial infarction or death occurred during the test. The target heart rate was achieved more frequently in the elderly patients (87% vs 79%; p < 0.05). The elderly patients had a higher prevalence of supraventricular tachycardia (7% vs 1%; p < 0.005) and premature ventricular contraction (74% vs 32%; p < 0.005) during the test, as compared to the younger patients. There was a trend to a higher prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (5% vs 2%) and atrial fibrillation (3% vs 0.4%) in the elderly patients. Arrhythmias were terminated spontaneously by termination of dobutamine infusion or by administration of metoprolol. Independent predictors of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia were older age (p < 0.001; chi(2), 9.8) and myocardial perfusion defect score at rest (p < 0.01; chi(2), 6.8) respectively, by using a multivariate analysis of clinical and stress test variables. Elderly patients had a higher prevalence of systolic BP drop > 20 mm Hg during the test (37% vs 12%; p < 0.05). The test was terminated due to hypotension in 2% of the elderly patients and in 1% of the control group. Age was the most powerful predictor of hypotension (p < 0.005; chi(2), 10.3). The test was considered feasible in 216 elderly patients (95%) and in 209 patients of the control group (92%).
Dobutamine-atropine stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is a highly feasible method for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in the elderly. Elderly patients have a higher risk for developing hypotension and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias during a dobutamine stress test. However, dobutamine-induced hypotension is often asymptomatic and rarely necessitates the termination of the test.
Clofibric acid (CLO) is a nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogen in rodents that causes altered hepatocellular foci and/or neoplasms. Initiation by DNA-damaging agents such as diethylnitrosamine (DEN) accelerates focus and tumor appearance and could therefore significantly contribute to shortening of the regulatory 2-year rodent carcinogenicity bioassays. However, it is crucial to evaluate the histological and molecular impact of initiation with DEN on hepatocarcinogenesis promoted by CLO. Male F344 rats were given a single nonnecrogenic injection of DEN (0 or 30 mg/kg) followed by Control diet or CLO (5000 ppm) in diet for up to 20 months. Histopathology and gene expression profiling were performed in liver tumors and surrounding nontumoral liver tissues. The molecular signature of DEN was characterized and its histopathological and immunohistopathological effects on focus and tumor types were also determined. Although foci and tumors appeared earlier in the DEN+CLO-treated group compared to the group treated with CLO alone, DEN had little impact on gene expression in nontumoral tissues since the gene expression profiles were highly similar between Control and DEN-treated rats, and DEN+CLO- and CLO-treated rats. Finally, tumors obtained from DEN+CLO and CLO-treated groups displayed highly correlated gene expression profiles (r>0.83, independently of the time-point). The pathways involved in tumor development revealed by Gene Ontology functional analysis are similar when driven either by spontaneous initiation or by a chemically induced initiation step. Our work described here may contribute to the design optimization of shorter preclinical tests for the evaluation of the nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogenic potential of drugs under development.
To clarify if programmed cell death mechanisms induced by seizures take part in the necrotic process of neurons.
Seizure was induced by pilocarpine (P) in Sprague-Dawley adult rats which were allowed to recover for 24 or 72 hours before perfusion-fixation. Neuronal death was assessed by light microscopy with the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and with in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression were examined by histochemistry.
Twenty-four and 72 hours after seizures, neuronal death in hippocampus CA1 region was morphologically necrotic. TUNEL-positive and morphologically necrotic cells increased in the hippocampal CA1 region at 72 hours after seizures, there was significant difference compared with controls (P < 0.001). Bax expression was also increased in the hippocampal CA1 region at 72 hours after seizures (P < 0.001), but Bcl-2 expression did not increase, while Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased.
Seizures induced late-onset neuronal necrosis was accompanied by programmed cell death mechanisms.
The antihypertensive and biochemical effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared with those of the thiazide diuretic bendrofluazide. Patients with untreated mild to moderate essential hypertension were entered into a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. Blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) with either drug therapy: from 172/103 to 147/87 mm Hg (n = 18) with enalapril and from 179/104 to 165/95 mm Hg (n = 22) with bendrofluazide; thus, enalapril produced a greater reduction (p less than 0.05) than bendrofluazide. The median dose of enalapril was 20 mg/day (range 10 to 40) and that of bendrofluazide was 5 mg/day (range 2.5 to 10). Both drugs reduced serum sodium levels by small amounts. This was significant only for enalapril (decrease of 1.3 mmol/liter, p less than 0.05). Hyponatremia was not seen in any patient. Three patients were withdrawn from each treatment group due to adverse effects, although both drugs were generally well tolerated.
A 27-year-old female was admitted to a hospital because of severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.9 g/dl) after taking PL (a drug for common cold consisted of Salicylamide, Acetaminophen, Caffeine and Promethazine methylene di-salicylate) and Cefadroxil (an oral antibiotic) for ten days. History and laboratory data leaded to a diagnosis of drug induced hemolytic anemia. 6 units of concentrated red blood cells were transfused and the suspected drugs were discontinued immediately. Though resolution of anemia and no further hemolysis were observed, progressive leukocytopenia developed since four days after the admission. Bone marrow aspiration revealed marked decrease of granulocytic series. The patient was transferred to our hospital and was isolated under laminar air-flow to prevent her from bacterial and fungal infections. She was treated with prednisolone and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. She recovered from leukocytopenia in two weeks without suffering from any life-threatening infection. We extensively analyzed the suspected drugs and mechanism of hemolysis and granulocytopenia. Cefadroxil is turned out to be contributed to hemolysis by an immune complex mechanism. Cefadroxil and Salicylamide were suggested to be involved in granulocytopenia by the induction of antibodies against the leukocytes to which these drugs were bound. Thus Cefadroxil was regarded as a causative drug of both hemolysis and granulocytopenia. This case is of interest for analyzing drug-induced blood abnormality because it is very rare that two lineage of blood were injured by one drug at the same time as far as we know.
Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are chemicals that negatively impact endocrine system function, with effluent from paper mills one example of this class of chemicals. In Florida, female Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) have been observed with male secondary sexual characteristics at three paper mill-impacted sites, indicative of EDC exposure, and are still found at one site on the Fenholloway River. The potential impacts that paper mill effluent exposure has on the G. holbrooki endocrine system and the stream ecosystem are unknown. The objective of this study was to use gene expression analysis to determine if exposure to an androgen receptor agonist was occurring and to couple this analysis with in vitro assays to evaluate the presence of androgen and progesterone receptor active chemicals in the Fenholloway River. Focused gene expression analyses of masculinized G. holbrooki from downstream of the Fenholloway River paper mill were indicative of androgen exposure, while genes related to reproduction indicated potential progesterone exposure. Hepatic microarray analysis revealed an increase in the expression of metabolic genes in Fenholloway River fish, with similarities in genes and biological processes compared to G. holbrooki exposed to androgens. Water samples collected downstream of the paper mill and at a reference site indicated that progesterone and androgen receptor active chemicals were present at both sites, which corroborates previous chemical analyses. Results indicate that G. holbrooki downstream of the Fenholloway River paper mill are impacted by a mixture of both androgens and progesterones. This research provides data on the mechanisms of how paper mill effluents in Florida are acting as endocrine disruptors.
A patient manifesting an acute psychosis after receiving an injection of procaine penicillin is reported. The psychosis began immediately after drug administration and gradually abated over a forty-eight-hour period. The clinical presentation was dominated by paranoid delusions and a Capgras-like syndrome. Sixty-six previously reported cases were identified and reviewed. Patients manifested combinations of fear, auditory hallucinations, somatic hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid or religious delusions. The syndrome may occur with inadvertent intravenous injection of procaine and most likely reflects the action of procaine on limbic system structures.
