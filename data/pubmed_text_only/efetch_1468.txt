A case of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis associated with Evans' syndrome of immune haemolytic anaemia is reported. The neurological symptoms and signs were headaches, right quadrant hemianopia, dyslexia without agraphia, motor aphasia, numbness in and weakness of the right upper extremity, papilloedema and coma. The cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, involving cerebral veins, superior sagittal sinus and straight sinus, was diagnosed by cerebral angiography. It is noteworthy that the superior sagittal sinus thrombosis occurred during a haematological recovery period, with rapid responses to treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and high doses of adrenocorticosteroids. Following a reduction in the doses of these drugs, the symptoms and signs related to the superior sagittal sinus thrombosis gradually subsided, and the haematological pictures remained in remission.
We compared the effect of intracavernous administration of sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor and, therefore, stimulator of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, with the activity of prostaglandin E1, which is a stimulator of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway. To date 105 patients with erectile dysfunction have entered the study. As part of the diagnostic evaluation every patient received an intracavernous injection of 20 micrograms prostaglandin E1 and a second injection of sodium nitroprusside at different concentrations (100 micrograms in 10 patients, 300 micrograms in 60 and 400 micrograms in 35). Sodium nitroprusside at a dose of 100 micrograms was not effective for inducing erections. Prostaglandin E1 induced better responses overall than sodium nitroprusside at 300 and 400 micrograms (p < 0.001). The overall duration of erections was also significantly longer with prostaglandin E1 (mean 88.5 minutes) than with 300 micrograms sodium nitroprusside (mean 50.8 minutes, p < 0.001) but did not reach statistical significance compared to 400 micrograms sodium nitroprusside (mean 42.2 minutes). Side effects were minimal with both drugs. Although sodium nitroprusside has several benefits over prostaglandin E1 for intracavernous use (such as lower cost, absence of local pain and shorter action, allowing detumescence after orgasm and decreasing the risk of priapism), prostaglandin E1 still remains the agent of choice for intracavernous use.
Anthelmintic imidazoles induced delayed encephalopathy (AIIDE) is frequently encountered and has usually been misdiagnosed as sporadic encephalitis of unknown cause (SEU). This study was carried out to facilitate differentiation of the two diseases. The records of 202 cases of AIIDE were reviewed and the clinical features analyzed. As a results, 7 diagnostic criteria for AIIDE were proposed as follows: (1) history of exposure to anthelmintic before the onset; (2) presence of a latent period of of 2 to 5 weeks; (3) onset of the disease acute or subacute; (4) presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs resulted from multifocal cerebral damage; (5) Fulfillment of two of the following conditions; (a) subinflammatory change in CSF with elevation of IgG; (b) diffuse slow waves in EEG during early stage; (c) characteristics of acute demyelinating encephalopathy in brain biopsy; (6) good therapeutic effect of adrenal corticosteroids; (7) exclusion of other neuropsychiatric disorders in a fallow-up period of one year. AIIDE is a new disease entity and its diagnosis is mainly based on the clinical features. EEG, CT or MRI are important diagnostic measures, but history of exposure to anthelmintic is the most important criterion. Multifocal hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy is its main pathologic feature.
We report three cases of pathological gambling induced by aripiprazole, in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All three patients had no history of pathological gambling, and they started gambling after initiation of treatment with Aripiprazole. The fact that pathological behaviour disappears quickly as medication was ended suggests that an elaborate behavioral manifestation could be related to dopaminergic tone in patients with schizophrenia. We recommend consideration with increased attention for the appearance of pathological gambling symptoms among patients on Aripiprazole.
This case highlights the possibility of late-onset severe cardiotoxicity resulting in sudden cardiac death from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy. Late-onset cardiotoxicity of 5-FU, after initial tolerance, has not been reported before.
A patient with a dilated cardiomyopathy experienced a cardiac arrest when taking tocainide for asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. After successful resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation and exclusion of a myocardial infarction, an electrophysiological evaluation was performed. Drug-free study #1 revealed no induction of ventricular tachycardia. A tocainide study revealed induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Drug-free study #2 revealed induction of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. This report illustrates a possible proarrhythmic effect of tocainide.
The authors' goal was to compare serum anticholinergicity of 61 elderly depressed patients randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with paroxetine (N=31) or nortriptyline (N=30).
Both antidepressants were titrated in a standardized manner, and plasma was sampled weekly for measurement of paroxetine and nortriptyline and its hydroxy metabolite concentrations. Serum anticholinergicity was measured at baseline and after 1, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment. Side effects were assessed by using a validated scale.
After correcting for pretreatment anticholinergicity, the authors found that mean serum anticholinergicity for the nortriptyline-treated patients was significantly greater than that for the paroxetine group at all weeks assessed. Serum anticholinergicity was significantly correlated with nortriptyline but not with paroxetine plasma levels. Complaints of dry mouth and tachycardia were significantly more frequent and severe in the nortriptyline group.
These findings suggest that, at therapeutic plasma concentrations, paroxetine has approximately one-fifth the anticholinergic potential of nortriptyline in older patients.
Zafirlukast is a leukotriene inhibitor that has recently been approved for the prophylaxis of asthma. Although this new product has been well accepted because of its convenient dosing and relatively few side effects, several cases of Churg-Strauss syndrome have been reported to be associated with its use. In this paper we describe the case of a 54-year-old white man with no history of corticosteroid therapy in whom leukocytoclastic vasculitis, hepatitis and eosinophilia developed while he was on zafirlukast therapy for mild asthma.
Lidocaine has been reported to cause neural tube closure defects in vitro in mice at clinically relevant concentrations. However, no studies have been conducted to further investigate this potentially hazardous effect of lidocaine. This study was aimed to reassess teratogenic effects of lidocaine in vitro in rats.
Sprague-Dawley rat embryos were explanted at 8:00 AM on gestational day 9 and were cultured in medium containing various concentrations of lidocaine. (Embryos in the control group were cultured without lidocaine). After 50 h of culture, they were evaluated for growth size and morphology, including the neural tube closure.
In the presence of 250 microM of lidocaine, embryos showed a increased incidence of situs inversus compared with control group but were otherwise normal. At 375 microM, embryos showed slight growth retardation but no significant morphologic abnormalities. At 500 microM, all viable embryos showed severe morphologic abnormalities. However, morphologic abnormalities were so-called nonspecific types and neural tube closure defects were not observed.
Results from the current study indicate that lidocaine causes teratogenic effects in vitro in rats only at concentrations much higher than clinically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, lidocaine did not cause neural tube closure defects at any concentrations evaluated.
This prospective, longitudinal project was designed to determine the effects of prenatal cocaine use on the pregnancy outcomes of women from a historically understudied rural public health population.
We interviewed over 2500 women prenatally, identified 154 cocaine users, and matched 154 controls on race, parity, socioeconomic status, and location of prenatal care (that related to level of pregnancy risk). Drug testing was required at enrollment and at delivery; detailed demographic, psychosocial, and drug histories were taken at each available trimester and follow-up visit. After birth, neonatal nurse practitioners, blinded to maternal history of drug use, examined infants to assess gestational age and take growth measurements. Medical charts were reviewed and the Hobel Risk Scale was completed.
Compared with controls, the cocaine users had significantly higher Hobel Prenatal and Total Risk Scores and more preterm infants (28 vs 14), but not a significantly greater number of fetal deaths (3 vs 1). After controlling for the effects of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco use, the following results remained. There was no difference in gestational age, Ponderal Index, birth weight, or length between infants born to cocaine users and controls. There was a significant interaction effect such that infant head and chest circumference were smaller in cocaine users who also smoked tobacco. Significant correlation coefficients demonstrated the effects of the amount of drug usage on fetal growth during each trimester of pregnancy. The average cocaine use per day for trimesters one and three and for the entire pregnancy was negatively related to birth length. The mean amounts used in trimesters two and three were negatively related to head circumference. Amounts of tobacco and alcohol use in pregnancy were also inversely related to fetal growth measures. When the effects of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco were partialed out, there continued to be a negative relationship between the amount of cocaine used in the third trimester and infant length and head circumference.
The observed decrement in fetal growth, especially head circumference, among cocaine-exposed neonates raises concerns about later growth and development. Follow-up of these infants will reveal if these disadvantages continue. These early results also emphasize the importance of considering amount and time of drug exposure as well as the interactive effects of drug exposure and other risk variables.
This prospective, longitudinal project was designed to determine the effects of prenatal cocaine use on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants from a historically understudied rural public health population.
We interviewed > 2500 women prenatally, identified 154 cocaine users, and matched 154 controls on race, parity, socioeconomic status, and location of prenatal care (that related to level of pregnancy risk). Drug testing was required at enrollment and at delivery; detailed demographic, psychosocial, and drug histories were taken at each available trimester and follow-up visit. After birth, certified evaluators, blinded to maternal history of drug use, administered the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS) under controlled conditions. Evaluation time for preterm infants was adjusted for gestational age.
After controlling for the effects of marijuana (users of other illicit drugs were excluded), alcohol, and tobacco use, the following results remained. There were significant drug group interactions on the BNBAS Qualifier Score of Alert Responsiveness that demonstrated lower scores among infants who were exposed to both cocaine and tobacco and among those exposed to both marijuana and tobacco. There were also significant correlations between the amount of cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine exposure and several BNBAS scores. The reported amount of cocaine use in the third trimester was negatively related to scores of Orientation, Cost of Attention, and Alert Responsiveness (that was also related to amount of cocaine used over the entire pregnancy). When the effects of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco were partialled out, the amount of cocaine use in the third trimester was negatively related to Regulation of State, a precursor of alertness, and the infant's ability to orient to the environment.
The observed decrement in state regulation, attention, and responsiveness among cocaine-exposed neonates raises concerns about later developmental abilities as well as the effect these infants may have on caregivers (who themselves may be compromised in their parenting abilities by their drug use). Follow-up of these infants will reveal if these disadvantages continue. These early results also emphasize the importance of considering amount and time of drug exposure as well as the interactive effects of drug exposure and other risk variables.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, is generally treated with high doses of co-trimoxazole. However, treatment is often limited by adverse effects. Here, we report two cases of severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients who developed severe intrahepatic cholestasis, and in one patient lesions mimicking liver abscess formation on radiologic exams, during co-trimoxazole treatment for PCP. Whereas patient 1 showed lesions of up to 1 cm readily detectable on magnetic resonance imaging under prolonged co-trimoxazole treatment, therapy of patient 2 was switched early.
Although 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain malignant cells, its hypercalcemic effect has prevented clinical application. We have recently developed a novel vitamin D3 analog, 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 (OCT), that is capable of promoting differentiation and inhibiting proliferation without inducing hypercalcemia. The present study was undertaken to determine whether OCT could be applied for the treatment of breast cancer with or without estrogen receptor (ER). OCT inhibited the proliferation of both ER-positive (MCF-7, T-47D, and ZR-75-1) and ER-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT-20) in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as determined by cell number and [3H]thymidine uptake. The antiproliferative effect was observed with a concentration as low as 10(-11) M OCT, and treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10(-8) M OCT for 8 days caused more than a 50% reduction in cell number compared with that of vehicle-treated cells. OCT was approximately 1 order of magnitude more potent than 1,25-(OH)2D3 in inhibiting the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The in vivo effect of OCT was examined in athymic mice implanted with ER-negative MX-1 tumor, which was established as the xenograft derived from human breast carcinoma. Intratumor administration of OCT three times a week remarkably delayed the growth of MX-1 tumor in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The antitumor effect of 1 microgram/kg BW OCT was greater than that of 500 microgram/kg BW adriamycin, and the relative tumor weights in each group on day 26 were 29.7% and 50.5% of that in the vehicle-treated group, respectively. The effects of OCT and adriamycin were additive, and the relative tumor weight after 26 days of combined treatment was 21.7% of that in the vehicle-treated group. Oral administration of OCT was also effective, and the relative tumor weight in the OCT-treated group (1 microgram/kg BW) was 54.6 +/- 0.1% (mean +/- SEM) of that in the vehicle-treated group. Neither intratumor nor oral administration of OCT raised the serum calcium level in these animals. These results demonstrate that OCT is a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of breast cancer cells with or without ER and that OCT inhibits the growth of breast cancer in vivo without inducing hypercalcemia. We suggest that OCT may provide a new strategy for the treatment of breast carcinoma regardless of ER status.
Mutations in the gene encoding parkin, a neuroprotective protein with dual functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional repressor of p53, are linked to familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesized that oxidative posttranslational modification of parkin by environmental toxins may contribute to sporadic PD.
We first demonstrated that S-nitrosylation of parkin decreased its activity as a repressor of p53 gene expression, leading to upregulation of p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation as well as gel-shift assays showed that parkin bound to the p53 promoter, and this binding was inhibited by S-nitrosylation of parkin. Additionally, nitrosative stress induced apoptosis in cells expressing parkin, and this death was, at least in part, dependent upon p53. In primary mesencephalic cultures, pesticide-induced apoptosis was prevented by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In a mouse model of pesticide-induced PD, both S-nitrosylated (SNO-)parkin and p53 protein levels were increased, while administration of a NOS inhibitor mitigated neuronal death in these mice. Moreover, the levels of SNO-parkin and p53 were simultaneously elevated in postmortem human PD brain compared to controls.
Taken together, our data indicate that S-nitrosylation of parkin, leading to p53-mediated neuronal cell death, contributes to the pathophysiology of sporadic PD.
The subjective response to antipsychotic medication was systematically evaluated in two samples of schizophrenic patients, one treated with haloperidol, the other with thiothixene. For both groups, a dysphoric response to the first dose was found to be a powerful predictor of noncompliance. A persisting dysphoric response was associated with a poor clinical outcome. Dysphoric responses were powerfully associated with akathisia. Patients' subjective responses were consistent throughout therapy, and there was moderate agreement between the patients' evaluation of the medication and the staff's ratings of improvement. The authors suggest that the subjective response to antipsychotic medication should not be dismissed and that dysphoric responses should be acknowledged.
Faciogenital dysplasia or Aarskog-Scott syndrome (AAS) is a genetically heterogeneous developmental disorder. The X-linked form of AAS has been ascribed to mutations in the FGD1 gene. However, although AAS may be considered as a relatively frequent clinical diagnosis, mutations have been established in few patients. Genetic heterogeneity and the clinical overlap with a number of other syndromes might explain this discrepancy. In this study, we have conducted a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the entire coding region of FGD1 in 46 AAS patients and identified eight novel mutations, including one insertion, four deletions and three missense mutations (19.56% detection rate). One mutation (528insC) was found in two independent families. The mutations are scattered all along the coding sequence. Phenotypically, all affected males present with the characteristic AAS phenotype. FGD1 mutations were not associated with severe mental retardation. However, neuropsychiatric disorders, mainly behavioural and learning problems in childhood, were observed in five out of 12 mutated individuals. The current study provides further evidence that mutations of FGD1 may cause AAS and expands the spectrum of disease-causing mutations. The importance of considering the neuropsychological phenotype of AAS patients is discussed.
An emerging literature suggests that bisphenol A (BPA), a widespread endocrine disrupting chemical, when exposure occurs in early life, may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that perinatal exposure to BPA predisposed offspring to fatty liver disease: the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and its possible mechanism. Pregnant Wistar rats were administered with BPA (40μg/kg/day) or vehicle during gestation and lactation. Liver histology, biochemical analysis, transcriptome, and mitochondrial function were examined in male offspring at postnatal 3, 15 and 26 weeks. At 3 weeks of age, abnormal liver morphology and function were not observed in the BPA-exposed offspring, but a decrease in mitochondrial respiratory complex (MRC) activity (I and III) and significant changes in gene expression involved in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism were observed compared with controls. At 15 weeks, micro-vesicular steatosis in liver, up-regulated genes involved in lipogenesis pathways, increased ROS generation and Cytc release were observed in the BPA-exposed offspring. Then, extensive fatty accumulation in liver and elevated serum ALT were observed in BPA-exposed offspring at 26 weeks. In the longitudinal observation, hepatic mitochondrial function including MRC activity, ATP production, ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential were progressively worsened in the BPA-exposed offspring. Perinatal BPA exposure contributes to the development of hepatic steatosis in the offspring of rats, which may be mediated through impaired hepatic mitochondrial function and up-regulated hepatic lipid metabolism.
microRNAs aberrant behavior in heptocellular carcinoma (HCC) plays a major role in HCC pathogenesis. miR-615-5p expression has never been evaluated in HCC. We showed that miR-615-5p was preferentially expressed in HCC, cirrhotic liver tissues and HCC cell lines, but undetected in normal livers. Forced miR-615-5p expression in HCC cell lines led to significant decrease in cell growth and migration. In-silico predication revealed insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) as a potential downstream target for miR-615-5p. Forcing the expression of miR-615-5p showed downregulation of IGF-II mRNA, as well as inhibition of the luciferase activity in a luciferase reporter vector harboring the IGF-II-3'UTR target sequence. miR-615-5p acts as tumor-suppressor in HCC through targeting IGF-II.
Here, we examined the impact of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and monomethyl mercury (MeHg) on the redox milieu and survival of hepatocytes from Hoplias malabaricus (traíra). After isolation and attachment of cells, we established one control and four treatments: DDT (50nM of DDT), MeHg I (0.25microM of MeHg), MeHg II (2.5microM of MeHg) and DDT * MeHg I (combination of 50nM of DDT and 0.25microM of MeHg). After four days the exposed hepatocytes presented significantly increased damage in lipids (all treatments), proteins (DDT * MeHg I and MeHg II) and reduced cell viability (all treatments). Also the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase were affected. The current data showed that despite of some protective responses, the increased disturbs on membrane lipids and proteins, increased hydrogen peroxide levels, and decreased glutathione concentration and cell viability strongly indicate oxidative stress as the reason of hepatotoxicity due to DDT and MeHg exposure. In addition, DDT and MeHg together had greater effect than alone when G6PDH and glutathione-S-transferase activities and lipids damage were considered. These findings are indicative of hepatotoxicity occurring at realistic concentrations of DDT and MeHg found in Amazonian fish tissues.
The potential pathogenicity of free radicals may have a pivotal role in ulcerative colitis. Fish oil omega-3 fatty acids exert anti-inflammatory effects on patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but the precise mechanism of the action of fish oil on oxidative stress is still controversial. The aim of the present work was to verify the blood oxidative stress in patients with UC and determine whether the association of sulfasalazine to fish oil omega-3 fatty acids is more effective than isolated use of sulfasalazine to reduce the oxidative stress.
Nine patients (seven female and two male; mean age = 40 +/- 11 y) with mild or moderate active UC were studied in a randomized crossover design. In addition to their usual medication (2 g/d of sulfasalazine), they received fish oil omega-3 fatty acids (4.5 g/d) or placebo for 2-mo treatment periods that were separated by 2 mo, when they only received sulfasalazine. Nine healthy individuals served as control subjects to study the oxidative stress status. Disease activity was assessed by laboratory indicators (C-reactive protein, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, alpha1-antitrypsin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, hemoglobin, and platelet count), sigmoidoscopy, and histology scores. Analysis of oxidative stress was assessed by plasma chemiluminescence and erythrocyte lipid peroxidation, both induced by tert butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) and by plasma malondialdehyde. Antioxidant status was assayed by total plasma antioxidant capacity (TRAP) and microsomal lipid peroxidation inhibition (LPI). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase erythrocyte enzymatic activities were also determined.
No significant changes were observed in any laboratory indicator or in the sigmoidoscopy or histology scores, with the exception of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which decreased with both treatments. Oxidative stress was demonstrated by significant decreases in TRAP and LPI levels, increased chemiluminescence induced by t-BuOOH, and higher SOD activity in patients with UC. Treatment with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids reverted the chemiluminescence induced by t-BuOOH and LPI to baseline levels but that did not occur when patients received only sulfasalazine. Levels of plasma malondialdehyde, erythrocyte lipid peroxidation, and catalase were not different from those in the control group.
The results indicated that plasma oxidative stress occurs in patients with UC, and there was a significant decrease when the patients used sulfasalazine plus fish oil omega-3 fatty acids. However, there was no improvement in most laboratory indicators, sigmoidoscopy, and histology scores. The results suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may act as free radical scavengers protecting the patients against the overall effect of oxidative stress.
Non-selective classical transient receptor potential (TRPC) cation channels share important roles in processes of neuronal development and function. To test the influence of TRPC6 activity on behavior, we developed a TRPC6-deficient (TRPC6(-/-)) mouse model in a BALB/c genetic background. Both, TRPC6(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice were analyzed first for their general health and reflex status (modified SHIRPA protocol) and then in three different behavioral tests (marble-burying test, square open field and elevated star maze). No abnormalities were detected in the SHIRPA protocol. Most interestingly, TRPC6(-/-) mice showed no significant differences in anxiety in a marble-burying test, but demonstrated reduced exploration in the square open field and the elevated star maze. Therefore, TRPC6 channel activity may play a yet unknown role for exploration behavior.
Experimental, epidemiological and clinical evidence indicates that salt plays a major role in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension. Endocrine and membrane ion transport studies suggest a genetic disposition with regard to salt susceptibility. In the industrialized countries sodium intake in children probably exceeds the physiological needs. However, a reduction of salt consumption in the general paediatric population cannot be recommended as the longterm risk benefit ratio is currently unknown. In children with manifest arterial hypertension sodium intake should be reduced below 2 mval/kg/day. Diuretic therapy is an important part of antihypertensive treatment. Thiazides and in renal insufficiency furosemide are the drugs of choice. The side effects of diuretic therapy, such as hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia, in children require further investigation.
Octyl Methoxycinnamate (OMC) is a frequently used UV-filter in sunscreens and other cosmetics. The aim of the present study was to address the potential endocrine disrupting properties of OMC, and to investigate how OMC induced changes in thyroid hormone levels would be related to the neurological development of treated offspring. Groups of 14-18 pregnant Wistar rats were dosed with 0, 500, 750 or 1000 mg OMC/kg bw/day during gestation and lactation. Serum thyroxine (T(4)), testosterone, estradiol and progesterone levels were measured in dams and offspring. Anogenital distance, nipple retention, postnatal growth and timing of sexual maturation were assessed. On postnatal day 16, gene expression in prostate and testes, and weight and histopathology of the thyroid gland, liver, adrenals, prostate, testes, epididymis and ovaries were measured. After weaning, offspring were evaluated in a battery of behavioral and neurophysiological tests, including tests of activity, startle response, cognitive and auditory function. In adult animals, reproductive organ weights and semen quality were investigated. Thyroxine (T(4)) levels showed a very marked decrease during the dosing period in all dosed dams, but were less severely affected in the offspring. On postnatal day 16, high dose male offspring showed reduced relative prostate and testis weights, and a dose-dependent decrease in testosterone levels. In OMC exposed female offspring, motor activity levels were decreased, while low and high dose males showed improved spatial learning abilities. The observed behavioral changes were probably not mediated solely by early T(4) deficiencies, as the observed effects differed from those seen in other studies of developmental hypothyroxinemia. At eight months of age, sperm counts were reduced in all three OMC-dosed groups, and prostate weights were reduced in the highest dose group. Taken together, these results indicate that perinatal OMC-exposure can affect both the reproductive and neurological development of rat offspring, which may be a cause of concern, as humans are systematically exposed to the compound through usage of sunscreens and other cosmetics.
We reported earlier that the activation of free-radical-mediated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) cascade is the major pathway in the inflammatory lung disease induced by 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), a mustard gas analog. TNF-alpha induces activating protein 1 (AP-1) activation via phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The present study examines the relationship between CEES induced lung injury and MAPKs signaling pathway. Adult guinea pigs received single intratracheal injection of different doses of CEES and were sacrificed at different time points. CEES exposure caused lung injury with evidence of fibrosis. The optimum activation of all members of the MAPKs family (ERK1/2, p38 and JNK1/2) was achieved at 0.5 mg/kg dose and at 1h. No significant change was observed beyond that time point. This led to an activation of AP-1 transcription factors associated with an increase in the protein levels of Fos, activating transcription factor (ATF) and Jun family members. To explore the involvement of AP-1 in cell proliferation, we determined the protein levels of cell cycle protein cyclin D1 and cell differentiation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). An up regulation of these proteins was observed. Hence it is suggested that CEES exposure causes accumulation of TNF-alpha, which is associated with an activation of MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway and cell proliferation. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the observed effects are the adaptive responses of the lung or they contribute to the lung injury.
Air pollutants have been associated with increased diabetes in humans. We hypothesized that ozone would impair glucose homeostasis by altering insulin signaling and/or endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress in young and aged rats. One, 4, 12, and 24 month old Brown Norway (BN) rats were exposed to air or ozone, 0.25 or 1.0 ppm, 6 h/day for 2 days (acute) or 2 d/week for 13 weeks (subchronic). Additionally, 4 month old rats were exposed to air or 1.0 ppm ozone, 6 h/day for 1 or 2 days (time-course). Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were performed immediately after exposure. Serum and tissue biomarkers were analyzed 18 h after final ozone for acute and subchronic studies, and immediately after each day of exposure in the time-course study. Age-related glucose intolerance and increases in metabolic biomarkers were apparent at baseline. Acute ozone caused hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in rats of all ages. Ozone-induced glucose intolerance was reduced in rats exposed for 13 weeks. Acute, but not subchronic ozone increased α2-macroglobulin, adiponectin and osteopontin. Time-course analysis indicated glucose intolerance at days 1 and 2 (2>1), and a recovery 18 h post ozone. Leptin increased day 1 and epinephrine at all times after ozone. Ozone tended to decrease phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 in liver and adipose tissues. ER stress appeared to be the consequence of ozone induced acute metabolic impairment since transcriptional markers of ER stress increased only after 2 days of ozone. In conclusion, acute ozone exposure induces marked systemic metabolic impairments in BN rats of all ages, likely through sympathetic stimulation.
