There is evidence of increasing use of the synthetic cathinone mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone), particularly amongst clubbers. However, there have only two single case reports of mephedrone toxicity. The aim of this study is to report the pattern of clinical toxicity seen with mephedrone use.
We describe 15 patients who presented to our Emergency Department following self-reported mephedrone use. Significant clinical features seen included agitation in 53.3%, tachycardia in 40%, systolic hypertension in 20% and seizures in 20%. Twenty per cent required treatment with benzodiazepines, predominantly for management of agitation. All patients were discharged with no sequelae. Previous user reports have suggested that mephedrone use is associated with cool/blue peripheries; this was not seen in any of the patients in our series.
The pattern of toxicity seen with mephedrone in this series is similar to that seen with 1-benzylpiperazine which has recently been classified under UK and EU misuse of drugs legislation. On the basis of this, together with a recent confirmed mephedrone related death in Sweden, we feel that appropriate assessments should be undertaken to determine the legal status of mephedrone.
Acute rhabdomyolysis has rarely been reported after cytotoxic chemotherapy, including cytarabine and 5-azacytidine. We observed a case of acute rhabdomyolysis and renal failure after treatment with mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. No other cause of muscle injury could be identified, although biochemical analysis of a muscle biopsy specimen revealed a deficiency of muscle phosphorylase activity. Retreatment with doxorubicin and paclitaxel was not associated with recurrent rhabdomyolysis.
A few studies compared the additional effects of oral controller medicines on pulmonary function in asthmatic patients on a moderate dose of inhaled steroids. The aim of this study was to compare the additional effects of two oral asthma controllers, a leukotriene receptor antagonist and a sustained released theophylline (Theo), with a moderate dose of inhaled steroid on peak expiratory flow (PEF) and asthma-related symptoms. A total of 67 adult asthmatic patients with PEF < 80% predicted during a 2-week run-in period with 800 microg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate were randomized to receive either pranlukast, 450 mg/day (n = 33), or sustained released Theo, 200 mg/day (n = 34), for 4 weeks. Pranlukast and Theo did not significantly alter the symptom scores, use of rescue beta2-agonist, and daily PEF variability. However, both agents significantly increased both morning and evening PEF compared with the run-in periods. The effects of both medications were comparable. For asthmatic patients even on a moderate dose of inhaled steroids, the addition of either leukotriene receptor antagonist or sustained released Theo does not improve asthma-related symptoms but significantly and equally increases PEF.
The tetracycline class of antibiotics is infrequently used in clinical pediatrics due to its side effects: they include anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Hypersensitivity, a photosensibility reaction and a brownish discoloration of teeth is less frequently, a pseudotumor cerebri is rarely seen. Once therapeutic plasma levels are exceeded however, either by overdosage or decreased renal or hepatic clearance of the drug, serious complications like a secondary Fanconi-Syndrom or a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can occur. The increased toxicity of tetracyclines in pregnant women is well known. We would like to report a fatal case, where serious complications like a secondary Fanconi-Syndrom, toxic degeneration of the liver, a clinically undected pancreatitis and a protein loosing enteropathy are though to be either direct consequences of tetracycline overdosage or the indirect effect of a shocklike syndrom by means of a nonoliguric renal failure induced by tetracycline.
We previously reported that prenatal cocaine exposure increased susceptibility to cocaine-induced seizures later in life. Here we examine whether this enhanced susceptibility to seizures generalizes to other chemoconvulsants, and whether postnatal cocaine treatment similarly increases susceptibility. Following prenatal cocaine treatment (40 mg/kg; E10-20), both male and female rats were more likely to seize to a dose of 30 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) at 2 months of age, although the severity of the seizures observed was increased only in females. Daily cocaine injections (10-20 mg/kg SC) during the first 10 days after birth also produced effects that were dependent on the sex of the animal. Postnatally cocaine-treated female rats showed no greater incidence of seizures in response to an acute high dose of cocaine, but did exhibit an increased susceptibility to cocaine-kindled seizures. Male, but not female, postnatally cocaine-treated rats were more susceptible to PTZ-induced seizures. The increased susceptibility to seizures induced by two different chemoconvulsants after prenatal cocaine treatment suggests that developmental cocaine exposure, particularly during the second trimester equivalent, alters the balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain.
Reboxetine (REB) is a member of a new class of antidepressant drugs, which selectively inhibit the neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline. It is devoid of any affinity for neurotransmitter receptors nor does it inhibit monoamine oxidases A or B. Since our earlier studies have shown that antidepressant drugs administered repeatedly increase the responsiveness of alpha1-adrenergic receptors and induce the up-regulation of postsynaptic dopamine D2/D3 receptors in the rat brain, we designed the present experiments to determine whether repeated administration of REB evokes similar effects. The experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats. REB was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg (or 30 mg/kg in some cases) once or repeatedly (twice daily for 14 days). The obtained results show that REB administered repeatedly increased exploratory behavior induced by phenylephrine and potentiated the hyperlocomotion induced by D-amphetamine. These behavioral effects indicate the hyperresponsiveness of alpha1-adrenergic receptors. Biochemical studies did not show any changes in the binding parameters of [3H]prazosin (Bmax, or Kd), but the ability of the alpha1-adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine, to compete for these sites was significantly increased upon repeated administration of REB. Locomotor activity induced by quinpirole was not changed, although there was a potentiation of 7-OH-DPAT-induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats receiving repeated administration of REB. At the same time no significant changes in the binding of [3H]quinpirole and [3H]7-OH-DPAT, or at the level of mRNA coding for dopamine D2 receptors in the rat brain were observed. Enhanced responsiveness to 7-OH-DPAT observed in the behavioral studies might, therefore, result from alterations at the postreceptor level. The above results indicate that repeated administration of REB induces the adaptive changes in the alpha1-adrenergic receptors, especially it enhances their functional responsiveness. However, the question whether this functional responsiveness is important for the clinical antidepressant efficacy, remains to be elucidated.
Nine cases of symptomatic bradycardia are presented in which treatment with intravenous glucagon was administered when atropine failed to improve the patient's condition significantly. Although the cause often was not obvious at presentation, all nine subjects took oral medications that could have contributed to the development of symptomatic bradycardia. Eight of nine patients demonstrated clinical improvement 5 to 10 min after glucagon administration, which was consistent with its peak clinical action. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin were ultimately thought to have contributed to the majority of these presentations. This report suggests that glucagon may have a role in the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade and perhaps calcium channel blockade. Furthermore, the results in these cases suggest that future clinical trials should not be limited to drug-induced symptomatic bradycardia.
This study was undertaken to examine the dose-response relationship of zafirlukast (5 to 40 mg BID) and to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the 10-mg BID dose in school-aged children with mild to moderate asthma.
The efficacy and tolerability of zafirlukast, an oral leukotriene-receptor antagonist, has been demonstrated in adolescents and adults aged > or = 12 years.
Data from 2 placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials (trial 1, 4-week double-blind; trial 2, 6-week double-blind) were integrated. Children aged 5 to 11 years were randomly assigned to receive zafirlukast 5 mg BID (n = 99), 10 mg BID (n = 205), 20 mg BID (n = 105), 40 mg BID (n = 99), or placebo (n = 206). The primary outcome was change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) expressed as percent of predicted normal. Secondary outcomes were FEV1 (L), morning and evening peak expiratory flow, peak flow variability, short-acting beta2-agonist use, asthma episode score, and nights awakened by asthma.
Mean baseline FEV1 was 76.5% of predicted. The greatest improvements were generally seen with zafirlukast 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID, with no additional clinically significant benefits seen at higher doses. The pooled data analysis showed that 10 mg BID compared with placebo significantly improved (P < 0.045) all efficacy outcomes except asthma-episode score and nights awakened with asthma. However, in the subset of children who had > or = 1 night awakened per week at baseline (zafirlukast 10 mg BID = 78; placebo = 86), 10 mg BID significantly reduced nights awakened (P = 0.009) (mean difference from placebo at end point = -0.81 night/wk). All zafirlukast doses were well tolerated and had tolerability profiles that were clinically indistinguishable from placebo.
These results support the effectiveness and tolerability of the 10-mg BID dose of zafirlukast for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma in children.
A 37-year-old man with symptomatic acute atrial fibrillation and a low-voltage electrocardiogram was treated with flecainide intravenously. Instead of conversion to sinus rhythm, he developed a wide-complex tachycardia suggestive of ventricular tachycardia. The patient recovered following electric cardioversion. First-choice therapy for symptomatic atrial fibrillation of recent onset (duration < 48 hours) is chemical conversion with a class IC antiarrhythmic drug (e.g. flecainide, propafenone). However, in patients with structural heart disorders, these drugs may induce ventricular tachycardia. A low-voltage electrocardiogram is suggestive of left ventricular damage. For these patients, electric cardioversion is a better alternative.
Effect of ondansetron (5-HT3-receptor antagonist) was studied on the working memory deficits induced by scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist in rats using a three-panel runway apparatus. Varying doses of scopolamine (0.1-0.56mg/kg, ip) were administered alone or in combination with ondansetron (0.01-1.0 mg/kg, ip) and memory errors and latency period of the session were recorded on a three-panel runway apparatus. Treatment with scopolamine (0.56 mg/kg) produced working memory deficits in rats. Treatment with ondansetron (1.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the scopolamine-induced working memory deficits.
Mouth opening and the resistance to opening developed by the muscles of mastication were measured in 63 children anesthetized with halothane and relaxed with succinylcholine, pancuronium, or vecuronium. Measurement of mouth opening, induced by a constant test force, was made when each patient was deeply anesthetized, as judged by clinical parameters. Succinylcholine, vecuronium, or pancuronium was then administered. The mouth opening measurement was repeated immediately after the loss of limb muscle twitch response and 45 s following the loss of twitch response. For the 24 patients receiving succinylcholine, there was a significant reduction in mean mouth opening (P less than 0.0001) and a significant increase in jaw stiffness (P less than 0.0001) immediately after limb relaxation. Forty-five seconds after full limb relaxation was attained, the mean mouth opening was still reduced (P less than 0.0001) and the mean jaw stiffness was still increased (P less than 0.0003) in the succinylcholine group. Patients receiving either vecuronium or pancuronium did not show a significant change of mouth opening or jaw stiffness following limb relaxation. Three patients, who received succinylcholine, required several attempts at tracheal intubation due to increased resistance to mouth opening. Anesthesia and surgery proceeded in all patients. None of the patients developed malignant hyperthermia. In view of the fact that a reduction in mouth opening was a constant finding when succinylcholine was administered during halothane anesthesia, the assumption that isolated "masseter spasm" or jaw stiffness heralds malignant hyperthermia should be reconsidered.
Epidemiologic evidence suggests that chronic stress may alter susceptibility to air pollution. However, persistent spatial confounding between these exposures may limit the utility of epidemiologic methods to disentangle these effects and cannot identify physiologic mechanisms for potential differential susceptibilities.
Using a rat model of social stress, we compared respiratory responses to fine concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) and examined biological markers of inflammation.
Twenty-four 12-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups [stress/CAPs, stress/filtered air (FA), nonstress/CAPs, nonstress/FA]. Stress-group animals were individually introduced into the home cage of a dominant male twice weekly. Blood drawn at sacrifice was analyzed for immune and inflammatory markers. CAPs were generated using the Harvard ambient particle concentrator, which draws real-time urban ambient fine particles, enriching concentrations approximately 30 times. CAPs/FA exposures were delivered in single-animal plethysmographs, 5 hr/day for 10 days, and respiratory function was continuously monitored using a Buxco system.
Stressed animals displayed higher average C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and white blood cell counts than did nonstressed animals. Only among stressed animals were CAPs exposures associated with increased respiratory frequency, lower flows, and lower volumes, suggesting a rapid, shallow breathing pattern. Conversely, in animals with elevated CAPs exposures alone, we observed increased inspiratory flows and greater minute volumes (volume of air inhaled or exhaled per minute).
CAPs effects on respiratory measures differed significantly, and substantively, by stress group. Higher CAPs exposures were associated with a rapid, shallow breathing pattern only under chronic stress. Blood measures provided evidence of inflammatory responses. Results support epidemiologic findings that chronic stress may alter respiratory response to air pollution and may help elucidate pathways for differential susceptibility.
To elucidate the effects of steady-state methadone exposure on responding to cocaine conditioned stimuli and on cocaine-induced alterations in central opioid, hypocretin/orexin, and D2 receptor systems, male Sprague-Dawley rats received intravenous infusions of 1 mg/kg/inf cocaine paired with an audiovisual stimulus over three days of conditioning. Then, mini pumps releasing vehicle or 30 mg/kg/day methadone were implanted (SC), and lever pressing for the stimulus was assessed in the absence of cocaine and after a cocaine prime (20 mg/kg, IP). It was found that rats treated with vehicle, but not methadone, responded for the cocaine conditioned stimulus and displayed elevated mu-opioid receptor mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens core and basolateral amygdala, reduced hypocretin/orexin mRNA in the lateral hypothalamus, and reduced D2 receptor mRNA in the caudate-putamen. This is the first demonstration that steady-state methadone administered after cocaine exposure blocks cocaine-induced behavioral and neural adaptations.
To provide toxicokinetic and clinical evidence of the hydrolytic effect of paraoxonase-1 (PON1) on acute organophosphate poisoning in rats.
40 male Wistar rats were randomised into four equal groups. Dichlorvos administration group (A group) underwent dichlorvos injection (dissolved in corn oil) using intraperitoneal (ip) dose of 10 mg/kg. PON1 pretreatment group (B group) was injected with PON1 in the tail vein (intravenous), dose 9600 U/kg, 30 min prior to dichlorvos administration. In the treatment group (C group), atropine 0.05 mg/kg and pyraloxime chloride (PAM-CI) 120 mg/kg were injected intravenously within 2 min after dichlorvos administration. Finally, in the co-treatment group (D group), PON1 was injected intravenously with a dose of 9000 U/kg 30 min prior to dichlorvos administration; atropine 0.05 mg/kg and PAM-CI 120 mg/kg were injected intravenously within 2 min after dichlorvos administration. Blood was collected after administration. Plasma dichlorvos concentration was detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectra (LC-MS) method and clinical signs were observed. Toxicokinetic parameters were calculated in a statistical moment model.
AUC (0→∞) in group B was statistically different from that in groups A and C (p<0.05), while it was not different from group D (p>0.05); there was no statistical difference between group A and group C (p>0.05). The statistical results of Cmax were the same as those of AUC (0→∞). There were no differences of MRT between four groups (p>0.05). Clinical signs can be improved by PON1 and atropine + PAM-CI, and co-treatment can relieve signs more effectively.
PON1 can decrease the amount of dichlorvos that entered the blood, lowered the peak concentration and relieved clinical signs.
Among 329 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with D-penicillamine (DP), we found 4 cases of polymyositis. This incidence was significantly higher than the expected coincidence of rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis/dermatomyositis or than the presumed frequency of this complication among patients treated with DP. In the present report, we summarize and discuss the clinical findings in DP-induced polymyositis/dermatomyositis in our patients and others described in the literature.
Fifteen well-documented Parkinson patients treated with Madopar were switched to Sinemet for 3 months. The results were measured with an objective test procedure and compared. The effects of Madopar and Sinemet were equal provided th amount of levodopa was the same. There was one drop-out, because of ventricular extrasystoles. Attention is paid to the occurrence of involuntary hyperkinesias and the on-off-effect.
Mercury (Hg) is toxic to both the reproductive and nervous systems. In addition, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which conjugate glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, are involved in the detoxification of Hg.
In this study we examined the association between prenatal exposure to Hg and birth weight as well as the influence of GST polymorphisms.
The total Hg concentration in maternal and cord blood was measured from 417 Korean women and newborns in the Mothers and Children's Environmental Health study from 2006 to 2008. Information on birth weight was collected from the patients' medical records. The genotyping of glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) polymorphisms was carried out using polymerase chain reaction. Regression analysis was performed to determine the association between the blood Hg concentration and birth weight in mothers with GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms.
The geometric mean levels of Hg in the maternal blood during late pregnancy and in cord blood were 3.30 microg/L and 5.53 microg/L, respectively. For mothers with the GSTT1 null genotype, elevated Hg levels in maternal blood during late pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of lower birth weight. For mothers with both GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotype, both maternal and cord blood Hg levels were associated with lower birth weight.
This study suggests that the interactions of Hg with GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms play a role in reducing birth weight.
Estrogen binding sites were demonstrated by autoradiography in one transplantable and five primary diethylstilbesterol induced renal carcinomas in three hamsters. Radiolabelling, following the in vivo injection of 3H-17 beta estradiol, was increased only over the nuclei of tumor cells; stereologic analysis revealed a 4.5- to 6.7-times higher concentration of reduced silver grains over nuclei than cytoplasm of these cells. Despite rapid tubular excretion of estradiol which peaked in less than 1 h, the normal cells did not appear to bind the ligand. This is the first published report documenting the preferential in vivo binding of estrogen to nuclei of cells in estrogen induced hamster renal carcinomas.
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a major n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is reported to have various protective effects for cardiovascular disease. However, few studies have focused on the influence of EPA on vascular calcification.
Arterial medial calcification (AMC) was induced by administering warfarin (3 mg/g food) and vitamin K1 (1.5 mg/g food) for 2 weeks in Sprague-Dawley rats (control group), and EPA (1 g/kg/day) was administered for 2 weeks simultaneously with warfarin and vitamin K1 (EPA group) or after initiation of AMC (late EPA group). EPA showed a marked reduction of medial calcification in the EPA group, and showed a similar effect in the late EPA group. Immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses showed that EPA lowered the expression of osteogenetic markers, such as osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase and core binding factor-α1 in the aorta. Significant migration of macrophages with expression of matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 or MMP-9 was observed in the aortic adventitia around calcification. EPA also reduced macrophage infiltration, MMP-9 expression as well as gene expression of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1.
These observations indicate that EPA attenuates arterial medial calcification through an effect associated with the suppression of MMP-9 activity and inhibition of macrophage infiltration as well as osteogenic protein expression in warfarin-induced rat models.
Chlorophenoxy herbicides are widely used in the United States and Western Europe for broadleaf weed control in grain farming and park maintenance. Most of the spring and durum wheat produced in the United States is grown in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with more than 85% of the acreage treated with chlorophenoxy herbicides such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA). Rates of adverse birth outcomes in rural, agricultural counties of these states during 1995-1997 were studied by comparing counties with a high proportion of wheat acreage and those with a lower proportion. Information routinely collected and made available by federal agencies was used for this ecologic study. Significant increases in birth malformations were observed for the circulatory/respiratory category for combined sexes [odds ratio (OR) = 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-2.55]. A stronger effect was observed for the subcategory, which excluded heart malformations (OR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.14-3.59). In addition, infants conceived during April-June--the time of herbicide application--had an increased chance of being diagnosed with circulatory/respiratory (excluding heart) malformations compared with births conceived during other months of the year (OR = 1.75; 95% CI, 1.09-2.80). Musculoskeletal/integumental anomalies increased for combined sexes in the high-wheat counties (OR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.06-2.12). Infant death from congenital anomalies significantly increased in high-wheat counties for males (OR = 2.66; 95% CI, 1.52-4.65) but not for females (OR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.20-1.15). These results are especially of concern because of widespread use of chlorophenoxy herbicides.
Ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) is known to induce a striking hepatomegaly in rats. The purpose of these studies was to determine the causes of the hepatomegaly and compare the effect to other liver-enlarging compounds. Since the total hepatic DNA content was similar in control and APFO-treated rats, the hepatomegaly represented a hypertrophic rather than a hyperplastic response. The cytochrome P-450 content and activity of benzphetamine N-demethylase increased in the livers of APFO-treated rats, indicating the proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast to the membrane-bound enzymes, the soluble enzymes glutathione S-transferase and UDPglucuronyltransferase were unaffected by APFO treatment. The activity of carnitine acetyltransferase was disproportionately increased relative to carnitine palmitoyltransferase in the livers of APFO vs that in control rats, confirming the predominant proliferation of peroxisomes vs that of mitochondria. Morphological studies confirmed the proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisomes in the livers of APFO-treated rats. In contrast to many other peroxisome proliferating agents, APFO did not possess hypolipidemic activity.
A wide variety of movement disorders may occur as a consequence of the administration of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Although it has been suggested that the risk of parkinsonism is 10-fold higher in those taking valproate as compared with other AEDs, there have been no large, systematic trials assessing this.
To establish more precisely the prevalence of and risk factors for developing parkinsonism associated with valproate use,and to assess the occurrence of movement disorders with the newer AEDs.
Patients with epilepsy were recruited from the Toronto Western Hospital Epilepsy Clinic (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Each patient was examined by a movement disorder specialist who was blinded to the treatment status of the patient.
201 patients were included. Postural tremor was the most common movement disorder (45%), followed by parkinsonism (4.5%). The odds of having parkinsonism were 5 times higher with valproate than with other AEDs. No single factor predicted the presence of parkinsonism; however, many (5/9) of the patients concurrently used other drugs or had comorbidities that could have caused or exacerbated parkinsonism. None of the newer AEDs were clearly associated with the presence of movement disorders; however, the numbers were too small to make a formal analysis.
Although the risk of parkinsonism with valproate is higher than with other AEDs, it is lower than originally reported. The cases available were not enough to accurately comment on the prevalence of movement disorders with the newer AEDs.
Diclofenac sodium (Voltarol, Geigy Pharmaceuticals) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory derivative of phenylacetic acid. Although generally well-tolerated, asymptomatic abnormalities of liver function have been recorded and, less commonly, severe hepatitis induced by diclofenac. The patient described developed chronic active hepatitis after six months therapy with diclofenac sodium which progressed despite the withdrawal of the drug, a finding not previously reported.
Exposure to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM), even at low ambient concentrations, has clearly been linked to increases in mortality and morbidity. A 10- micro g m(-3) increase in PM10 (PM < 10 micro m) has been found to produce a 0.5% increase in daily mortality. The mechanism of action is a source of debate, although recent attention has focused on the cardiac effects of PM exposures. Likewise, several possible etiologic agents have been implicated, including ultrafine PM (PM <or= 100 nm), metals, and the acid components, yet the responsible constituent remains undetermined. During the catastrophic PM exposure episode in London in December 1952, some 4,000 excess deaths occurred at the height of the event. The extreme mortality during that episode and the preservation of archival autopsy tissues allow us the unique opportunity to report on the form and composition of December 1952 London PM in situ in tissues from persons known to have died from the smog exposure. Because absolute increases in mortality with current levels of PM in Western Europe and North America are low, analogous tissues are unlikely to be contemporaneously available. Taking a lung compartment (airway, airspace, interstitium, and lymph node) approach, we differentiated exposures contemporary with death from those of earlier origin. Electron microscopic analyses revealed the dominance of retained soot and a surfeit of other particle types. A variety of metal-bearing particle types were found in all compartments, but Pb, Zn, and SnZn types appeared the least biopersistent. The results support the acute toxicologic importance of ultrafine carbonaceous and metal PM.
Patients with chronic liver diseases frequently exhibit decreased bone mineral densities (BMD), which is defined as hepatic osteodystrophy (HOD). HOD is a multifactorial disease whose regulatory mechanisms are barely understood. Thus, an early diagnosis and therapy is hardly possible. Therefore, the aim of our study consisted in characterizing a mouse model reflecting the human pathomechanism. Serum samples were collected from patients with chronic liver diseases and 12-week old C57Bl6/N mice after 6-week treatment with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Repetitive injections of CCl4 induced liver damage in mice, resembling liver fibrosis in patients, as assessed by serum analysis and histological staining. Although CCl4 did not affect primary osteoblast cultures, μCT analysis revealed significantly decreased BMD, bone volume, trabecular number and thickness in CCl4-treated mice. In both HOD patients and CCl4-treated mice, an altered vitamin D metabolism with decreased CYP27A1, CYP2R1, vitamin D-binding protein GC and increased 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase hepatic gene expression, results in decreased 25-OH vitamin D serum levels. Moreover, both groups exhibit excessively high active transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) serum levels, inhibiting osteoblast function in vitro. Summarizing, our mouse model presents possible mediators of HOD, e.g. altered vitamin D metabolism and increased active TGF-β. Liver damage and significant changes in bone structure and mineralization are already visible by μCT analysis after 6 weeks of CCl4 treatment. This fast response and easy transferability makes it an ideal model to investigate specific gene functions in HOD.
Pro-convulsant withdrawal properties have been reported for a variety of GABA-modulatory drugs, such as the benzodiazepines (BDZs, [S.E. File, The history of BDZ dependence: a review of animal studies, Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 14 (1990) 135-146; P.R. Finley, P. E. Nolan, Precipitation of BDZ withdrawal following sudden discontinuation of midazolam, DICP 23 (1989) 151-152]), barbiturates and ethanol [N. Kokka, D.E. Sapp, U. Witte, R.W. Olsen, Sex differences in sensitivity to pentylenetetrazol but not in GABAA receptor binding, Pharm. Biochem. Behav. 43 (1992) 441-447]. In this report, we test the hypothesis that pro-convulsant effects are produced by withdrawal from the GABA-modulatory neurosteroid 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) after sustained exposure to elevated circulating levels of its parent compound progesterone (P). Seizure activity was precipitated by picrotoxin or with the BDZ inverse agonist n-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (beta-CC), and a seizure rating determined 24 h after abrupt discontinuation of P following a multiple withdrawal/chronic administration paradigm. In some cases, a pseudopregnant rat model was employed to produce increased ovarian production of P prior to withdrawal (ovariectomy). Rats undergoing P withdrawal exhibited greater seizure-like activity than vehicle-treated controls, and received seizure scores in the same range as rats undergoing BDZ withdrawal. Administration of a 5alpha-reductase blocker, MK-906, along with P, prevented this pro-convulsant effect of P withdrawal, suggesting that the GABA-modulatory 3alpha,5alpha-THP is the active compound responsible for this withdrawal effect. Combined administration of P and diazepam produced synergistic effects upon withdrawal and produced a seizure score higher than observed after withdrawal from either agent alone. These results suggest that P exhibits withdrawal properties via the neuroactive steroid 3alpha, 5alpha-THP, that include exacerbation of seizure activity. These results may have clinical relevance, as increased incidence and severity of seizures has been reported in susceptible women during times of declining circulating levels of P across the menstrual cycle [T. Backstrom, B. Zetterlund, S. Blom, M. Romano, Effects of intravenous progesterone infusions on the epileptic discharge frequency in women with partial epilepsy, Acta Neurol. Scand. 69 (1984) 240-248; A.G. Herzog, Progesterone therapy in women with complex partial and secondary generalized seizures, Neurology 45 (1995) 1660-1662].
