The University of Louisville currently maintains a database of work histories and exposure rankings for chemicals used in the production of polyvinyl chloride from the plant where the original angiosarcoma cases were identified. A 6-point ranking scale was used to characterize worker exposure to vinyl chloride by year, building, and job. Since this is ordinal data, non-parametric statistics have been used to evaluate exposure factors in case-control studies. Rank order analysis of vinyl chloride exposure and angiosarcoma shows a strong statistical association. In contrast, the method shows no association between vinyl chloride exposure and brain cancer. Exposure ranking is a reasonable alternative to estimation of actual dose. Rank order analysis allows for a rapid assessment of exposure-disease associations for case control studies.
The vascular endothelium is important for the early and late effects observed in lethally irradiated tissue and organs. We examined the effects of exogenously added superoxide dismutase on cell survival and angiogenesis in lethally irradiated human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells. Cell survival was significantly improved in superoxide dismutase-treated cells; the addition of superoxide dismutase to cells after irradiation was also effective for increased survival, as it was before irradiation. Moreover, treatment of cells with superoxide dismutase enhanced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 in human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells. The addition of superoxide dismutase to cells after irradiation attenuated the reduction of angiogenesis by irradiation, and inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinases signaling pathway abrogated the rescue effect of superoxide dismutase. Our results suggest that superoxide dismutase rescues human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells from endothelial dysfunction caused by irradiation via a pathway requiring activation of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2.
Twelve cases of confusional state after normal or excessive doses of clioquinol are discussed. They resemble transient global amnesia (TGA) of the classic type, but the episodes last longer (1-3 days), they are often accompanied by a variety of mental disturbances, and the onset and end are less well defined than in the classic type. A combination of SMON and acute encephalopathy due to clioquinol was observed in only one case. Apart from amnesia for the acute episode a permanent retrograde amnesia for a few days up to two months was left behind. The pathophysiology of these episodes is not clear, but they resemble the toxic reactions to clioquinol observed in dogs and experimental animals.
Aminoglycoside-induced renal toxicity is well known and may manifest with nonoliguric renal failure or renal tubular dysfunction. Aminoglycoside-induced renal tubular dysfunction could result in diffuse damage or manifest as a Fanconi-like syndrome, Bartter-like syndrome, or distal renal tubular acidosis. We discuss a patient who developed severe renal tubular dysfunction secondary to short-term therapy with Amikacin, resulting in refractory hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis, and polyuria. This constellation of biochemical abnormalities mimic Type 5 Bartter's syndrome, where there is activating mutation of the calcium sensing receptor in the thick ascending loop of Henle and the distal tubule. In this case this activation of the calcium sensing receptor was triggered by amikacin. This phenomenon has been described with gentamicin though never with amikacin. Recovery of the tubular dysfunction took 15 days following cessation of the offending drug, Amikacin.
Psychotomimetic drug-induced locomotor hyperactivity is a widely used animal model of psychotic states, such as in schizophrenia. We previously found that serotonergic lesions of the dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampus in rats result in enhanced phencyclidine-induced locomotor hyperactivity.
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of serotonin depletion in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus on hyperlocomotion induced by ketamine, cocaine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethampethamine (MDMA), methamphetamine, and D: -amphetamine.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were bilaterally microinjected with vehicle or the serotonergic neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), into the dorsal or ventral hippocampus using a stereotaxic approach. Separate cohorts of rats were used for each drug of abuse; each rat received saline and a low, medium, and high dose of the drug in a random-sequence, repeated-measures protocol. Locomotor hyperactivity following treatment was measured using automated photocell cages.
Similar to phencyclidine, 5,7-DHT-induced lesions of the dorsal hippocampus enhanced ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion at all doses. They also reduced methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion at the high dose only and caused a minor, biphasic modulation of responses to cocaine. Locomotor responses to D: -amphetamine and MDMA were unchanged by lesions of the dorsal hippocampus. Serotonergic lesions of the ventral hippocampus did not significantly alter locomotor hyperactivity induced by any of the drugs investigated.
These findings further implicate a role for serotonin in the dorsal hippocampus in modulating the behavioral effects of dissociative anesthetics, such as ketamine, with more subtle effects on psychostimulant drugs of abuse. The dorsal hippocampus may be a site of serotonergic dysfunction in aspects of schizophrenia.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is an inducible enzyme involved in neuroplasticity and the neuropathology of the central nervous system. This study evaluated the relationship between autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and polymorphisms of PTGS2 (the gene encoding Cox-2) with 151 Korean family trios including children with ASDs. We found that the A allele of rs2745557 was preferentially transmitted in ASDs (p < 0.01) and that the GAAA haplotype was significantly associated with ASDs (p < 0.01). We also observed statistically significant associations between each genotype and the specific symptom domain scores of ADOS and ADI-R, including communication, qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social interaction, and overactivity/agitation.
Twenty females with disseminated breast cancer received courses of polychemotherapy with 21-day intervals. The regimen comprised adriamycin (ADM), cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil in the dose 50, 500 mg/m2, respectively. 30 minutes prior to the treatment the patients were given the cardioprotector cardioxan (1000 mg/m2). Cardiological control (ECG, EF according to echo-CG and radionuclide ventriculography, PP/EP M1/M2, T1/T2 according to echo-polycardiography and Doppler cardiography) was performed before the treatment and at ADM total dose 200-300 mg/m2 followed by measurements at each dose increase by 100 mg/m2. The findings showed no evidence of ADM-related cardiac damage up to ADM dose 900-1000 mg/m2 in the case of cardioxan protection, though there was a tendency to M1/M2 increase which needs further studies as it suggests worsening of left ventricular diastolic contractility.
The hydroxyurea-didanosine combination has been shown to limit immune activation (a major pathogenic component of HIV/AIDS) and suppress viral load by both antiviral and cytostatic ('virostatic') activities. Virostatics action represent a novel approach to attack HIV/AIDS from multiple directions; however, the use of these drugs is limited by the lack of understanding of their dose-dependent mechanism of action and by fear of pancreatic toxicity, even though a large review of ACTG studies has shown that hydroxyurea does not increase the incidence of pancreatitis.
In vitro cytostatic and cytotoxic activity, inhibition of viral replication and immune activation by pharmacologically attainable plasma concentrations of hydroxyurea (10-100 micromol/l) and didanosine (1-5 micromol/l) were analyzed by cell proliferation, viability, apoptosis and infection assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In vivo, 600, 900 and 1200 mg daily doses of hydroxyurea in combination with standard doses of didanosine and stavudine were studied in 115 randomized chronically infected patients.
A cytostatic low (10 micromol/l) concentration of hydroxyurea inhibited cell proliferation and HIV replication in vitro. A gradual switch from cytostatic to cytotoxic effects was observed by increasing hydroxyurea concentration to 50-100 micromol/l, predicting that lower doses of hydroxyurea would be less toxic and more potent in vivo. The clinical results confirmed that 600 mg hydroxyurea was better tolerated, had fewer side effects and was more potent in suppressing HIV replication than the higher doses.
A bimodal, dose-dependent, cytostatic-cytotoxic switch is an immune-based mechanism explaining the apparent paradox that lowering the dose of hydroxyurea to 600 mg daily induces maximal antiviral suppression in HIV-infected patients.
Pisa syndrome, manifested with persistent lateral flexion of the trunk, is most commonly associated with prolonged treatment with typical antipsychotics. However, it was also reported as occurring with atypical antipsychotics. To our knowledge, there have been very few reports of clozapine-associated Pisa syndrome. Here we report 1 case of Pisa syndrome in a 39-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who developed tonic flexion of trunk and head toward the left side after clozapine treatment (400 mg/d) for 5 months. Clozapine was reduced to 25 mg/d within 15 days; the dystonic reaction then completely resolved within the next 3 to 4 weeks. Caution should be taken while prolonged use of clozapine in patients with risk factors of Pisa syndrome.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of reduced haloperidol, the main metabolite of the antipsychotic drug haloperidol, on psychopathology improvement and extrapyramidal adverse effects in acute schizophrenia. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of reduced haloperidol was studied. Serum concentrations of reduced haloperidol (C(RH)) and haloperidol (C(H)) were measured in an open clinical trial over 6 weeks of treatment in 57 acutely schizophrenic patients. Psychopathology was measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and several subscales. The assay of extrapyramidal adverse effects was conducted by means of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. A significant serum concentration-therapeutic effect relationship (SCTER) of haloperidol of the same data has been demonstrated. In our study, the influence of the metabolite reduced haloperidol on the antipsychotic activity of haloperidol was analysed by means of regression analysis of the residuals of the SCTER of haloperidol with C(RH). In addition, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of reduced haloperidol and direct relationships between C(RH) and the metabolite ratio C(RH)/C(H) with psychopathology improvement and extrapyramidal adverse effects were investigated. Reduced haloperidol was not found to interfere with the antipsychotic action of the parent drug. Patients with elevated C(RH) or elevated metabolite ratio C(RH)/C(H) did not show consistently lower clinical improvements compared with the fitting curve of the SCTER of haloperidol and therefore no significant relationship between C(RH) and the residuals of the SCTER of haloperidol was detected. Furthermore, no significant result was found in the analysis of the direct relationships of C(RH) and C(RH)/C(H) with clinical variables which, for example, indicate decreased outcome with increased C(RH). In contrast, because of the pharmacokinetic dependence of C(RH) and C(H), a trend for a bisigmoidal relationship with C(RH) emerged for some outcome variables which was traced as an epiphenomenon from the bisigmoidal SCTER of the parent drug (e.g. change of hostility after 3 weeks). No relationship of reduced haloperidol with extrapyramidal adverse effects could be detected. It is concluded that serum concentrations of reduced haloperidol are of minor value for the interpretation of data of therapeutic drug monitoring of haloperidol in patients with acute schizophrenia. Reduced haloperidol does not act as a 'false neuroleptic'.
We assessed the overall safety profile of amisulpride based on the results from 11 clinical studies performed in patients suffering from schizophrenia with predominance of positive or negative symptoms. A total of 1933 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with amisulpride (n = 1247) or haloperidol (n = 309), risperidone (n = 113), flupentixol (n = 62) and placebo (n = 202). Safety data collection was performed using open reporting, UKU scales or specific extrapyramidal side-effect scales; electrocardiogram recording and vital signs examination; laboratory data collection. Amisulpride demonstrated a satisfactory global safety profile in the range of doses usually prescribed. The number of patients having at least one extrapyramidal side-effect was higher in haloperidol patients compared with both amisulpride and risperidone patients (50% versus 30% in the two latter groups). For endocrine events, a similar rate was observed between amisulpride and risperidone groups (4% versus 6%, respectively) versus 1% in the haloperidol group. Electrocardiogram results were satisfactory, confirmed by the absence of cardiovascular events. The overall laboratory safety profile of amisulpride did not show clinically relevant abnormalities in liver function tests nor haematological abnormalities. Our extensive clinical data confirm the satisfactory safety profile of amisulpride which is superior to standard reference compounds.
Opisthorchis viverrini-related cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a fatal bile duct cancer, is a major public health concern in areas endemic for this parasite. We report here whole-exome sequencing of eight O. viverrini-related tumors and matched normal tissue. We identified and validated 206 somatic mutations in 187 genes using Sanger sequencing and selected 15 genes for mutation prevalence screening in an additional 46 individuals with CCA (cases). In addition to the known cancer-related genes TP53 (mutated in 44.4% of cases), KRAS (16.7%) and SMAD4 (16.7%), we identified somatic mutations in 10 newly implicated genes in 14.8-3.7% of cases. These included inactivating mutations in MLL3 (in 14.8% of cases), ROBO2 (9.3%), RNF43 (9.3%) and PEG3 (5.6%), and activating mutations in the GNAS oncogene (9.3%). These genes have functions that can be broadly grouped into three biological classes: (i) deactivation of histone modifiers, (ii) activation of G protein signaling and (iii) loss of genome stability. This study provides insight into the mutational landscape contributing to O. viverrini-related CCA.
To assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of non-pegylated liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (Myocet(R)) with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and rituximab (R-COMP) in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas.
Twenty-one patients were selected for the presence of negative concurrent clinical features such as cardiac comorbidity and/or previous treatment with anthracycline-based regimens. Liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m(2) was administered in association with cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2)), vincristine (1.4 mg/m(2)), prednisone (40 mg/m(2)) and rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) every 21 days for four to six cycles unless progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred.
A complete response (CR) was obtained in 16/21 patients (76%), three patients achieved a partial response (14%), with an overall response rate of 90%. Two patients (10%) did not respond to therapy. After a median follow-up of 13 months (range 2-36 months), 2/16 CR patients relapsed, with a disease-free survival (DFS) of 78%.
The replacement of doxorubicin with its non-pegylated liposomal pharmaceutical analogue was well tolerated and highly effective in inducing remission in this group of patients at high risk for cardiac toxicity or previously treated with anthracyclines. Its high tolerability and low incidence of cardiac events (only one patient) warrants further studies to confirm the clinical benefits of liposomal doxorubicin in this subset of patients.
The recent Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT) study, enrolling subjects who had previously experienced a myocardial infarction, has provided strong evidence that intravenous chelation therapy can markedly reduce risk for mortality and vascular events in diabetics, whereas no discernible benefit was observed in non-diabetics. It has plausibly been suggested that this reflects a role for transition metal ions--iron or copper--in the genesis of advanced glycation end products, key mediators of diabetic complications that can destabilize plaque. Since phlebotomy therapy fails to prevent vascular events in diabetics, we hypothesize that labile copper may be the chief culprit whose removal by chelation mediated the benefit observed in TACT. If so, strategies less time and labor intensive than chelation therapy might provide comparable benefit. A number of recent studies report that the copper-specific orally-active chelator trientine can reduce risk for range of diabetic complications in rodents; a clinical trial with this agent demonstrated some decrease in left ventricular mass in diabetics with ventricular hypertrophy. However, until this agent becomes less expensive, supplementation with high-dose zinc may represent a more feasible alternative. Zinc opposes the absorption and redox activity of copper via induction of the antioxidant protein metallothionein, which binds copper tightly. A great many studies demonstrate that increased expression of metallothionein decreases risk for tissue damage in diabetic rodents, and in some of these studies metallothionein expression was boosted by supplemental zinc. Zinc supplementation also modestly improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetics, and might reduce risk for diabetes by protecting pancreatic beta cells from oxidative stress. A long term study assessing the impact of supplementing diabetics with high-dose zinc, assessing risk for mortality, vascular events, and diabetic complications, may be warranted. Histidine, which readily forms complexes with copper that possess superoxide dismutase activity, also has potential for alleviating the contribution of loosely bound copper to AGE formation; moreover, in a recent clinical study, supplemental histidine improved insulin sensitivity and exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in women with metabolic syndrome. Since ascorbate can reduce labile copper and thereby enhance its pathogenicity, the impact of high-dose ascorbate supplementation on cardiovascular risk in diabetics should receive further study.
Despite its increasing popularity, little is known about the health effects of waterpipe smoking (WPS), particularly on the cardiovascular system. To investigate the role of WPS as a risk factor for vascular disease, we evaluated its effect on endothelial cell function, which is an early event in vascular disease pathogenesis. We assessed the changes in cell viability, ROS generation, inflammatory and vasodilatory markers and in vitro angiogenesis of human aortic endothelial cells in response to waterpipe smoke condensate exposure.
Mainstream waterpipe smoke condensate (WSC) was generated using a standard laboratory machine protocol. Compared to control, WSC induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in human primary endothelial cells. In addition, we assayed for impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and induced inflammation by studying the effect of WPS on the content and activity of AMPK, eNOS proteins and NF-κB p65 ser536 phosphorylation, respectively. WSC inhibited AMPK/eNOS phosphorylation and induced phosphorylation of p65. Moreover, we evaluated endothelial cells repair mechanism related properties that include migration/invasion and in vitro tube formation upon treatment with WSC. WSC reduced the motility and inhibited angiogenic potential of HAEC cells.
WPS induced endothelial cell dysfunction as evident by exerting oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired endothelial vasodilatory function and repair mechanisms. All together these data provide evidence for the potential contribution of WPS to endothelial dysfunction and thus to vascular disease.
Chronic cocaine exposure during critical periods of development induces short- and long-term effects. During the pubertal period, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis undergoes many dynamic changes. The present study investigated whether chronic periadolescent cocaine alters reproductive maturity in the rat. Sixty female Long-Evans hooded rats were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (20 mg cocaine/kg/day, saline injected and uninjected), for dosing from postnatal day 21 (P21) through P60. Several indicators of reproductive maturation and functioning were assessed during and following treatment. Cocaine exposure had no effect on the onset of puberty or on the date of first ovulation. The number of proestrus-estrus transitions was significantly lower in cocaine-exposed females compared to uninjected females, but not compared to saline-injected controls. This reduction was observed during exposure to cocaine, as well as after the cessation of injections. During the dosing period, cocaine-exposed rats also exhibited a greater number of cycles that had no clear P-E transition than did UN subjects; this effect disappeared once injections stopped. These alterations suggest immediate, and possibly persisting, alterations in the control of ovulation after chronic cocaine exposure throughout adolescence. Interestingly, during the injection period, the saline-injected females had a significantly greater number of diestrus days compared to uninjected and cocaine-injected animals, as well as a lower proportion of regular 4- and 5-day cycles. These differences disappeared once injections stopped. These results suggest a stress-induced irregularity of the estrous cycle, possibly attenuated by cocaine and recoverable after exposure. The present findings indicate that the HPG axis is susceptible to short-term, and possibly to long-term, alterations induced by cocaine exposure throughout the adolescent period.
Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for lung diseases and oral diseases. The present study examined the effect of nicotine on H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. In the presence of 1 microg/ml nicotine, cell viability was not affected, but the cells were unable to undergo H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis and instead died as a result of necrosis. Nicotine reduced the intracellular level of ATP, which is an important determinant of the form of cell death. These results suggest that nicotine can alter the cell death pathway by reducing the level of intracellular ATP, and that this effect may contribute to cigarette smoke-induced tissue destruction.
Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-Phthalate (DEHP) can affect glucose and insulin homeostasis in periphery and lead to insulin resistance, especially exposure of DEHP during critical developmental period. Given the potential relationship between insulin resistance and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly life, we investigated the relationship between perinatal DEHP exposure and AD pathogenesis. Our results suggested that perinatal exposure to DEHP can affect the expression of insulin and insulin-Akt- GSK-3β signal pathway in hippocampus. Furthermore, impaired cognitive ability and increased level of phospho-Tau was observed in DEHP-exposed rat offspring (1.25 ± 0.11 vs. 0.47 ± 0.07, P < 0.05). The present study demonstrates that perinatal exposure to DEHP may be a potential risk factor for AD pathogenesis associated with insulin resistance and insulin metabolism disorder in the hippocampus.
We examined whether women aged 60 years or older with ovarian cancer who were treated with surgery and postoperative chemotherapy are at higher risk of developing grade 4 hematological toxicity. Seventy-five patients were included: 34 patients aged < 60 years (group I) were compared with 41 patients aged > or =60 years (group II) after postoperative treatment with single-agent carboplatin or carboplatin/taxane combination chemotherapy. Secondary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors was performed to avoid dose reduction and chemotherapy delay. A total of 450 chemotherapy cycles was completed. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were mild in both groups. Overall, grade 4 neutropenia developed in 41% (group I) and in 49% (group II) (p=0.51). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 12% and 2%, respectively (p=0.17). The carboplatin/taxane combination was associated with grade 4 neutropenia in 42% (group I) and 58% (group II) (p=0.21). Women > or =60 years are not at higher risk of developing severe myelotoxicity than their younger counterparts, particularly after treatment with carboplatin/taxane combination chemotherapy.
To evaluate a possible influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) and an euglycemic clamp were performed in 10 nonobese, nondiabetic patients with mild hypertension before and after treatment with ramipril for 14 days. Following ramipril treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower (152.5 +/- 10.6/97.5 +/- 4.3 vs. 136.5 +/- 18.9/79.5 +/- 16.4 mm Hg). Therapy with ramipril showed no influence on glucose tolerance (serum glucose of 106.8 +/- 32.8 vs. 109.1 +/- 33.9 mg/dl at 120 min during the oGTT), insulin secretion (53.0 +/- 45.7 vs. 41.1 +/- 10.6 microU/ml at 120 min), and insulin sensitivity (glucose infusion rate of 180.8 +/- 60.7 vs. 199.8 +/- 77.5 mg/m2/min after 3 h of clamp). In conclusion, short-term treatment of hypertension with ramipril has no influence on glucose metabolism in nondiabetic patients.
Although the mechanism of action has not yet been defined, epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between elevated arsenic levels in drinking water and the incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell carcinomas. In the current studies, we demonstrate that mice exposed to 0.01% sodium arsenite in drinking water develop hyperplasia of the bladder urothelium within 4 weeks of exposure. This was accompanied by the accumulation of inorganic trivalent arsenic, and to a lesser extent dimethylarsinic acid, in bladder tissue, as well as a persistent increase in DNA binding of the activating protein (AP)-1 transcription factor. AP-1 transactivation by arsenic also occurred in bladders of transgenic mice containing an AP-1 luciferase reporter. Consistent with these in vivo observations, arsenite increased cell proliferation and AP-1 DNA binding in a human bladder epithelial cell line. Gene expression studies using RNase protection assays, reverse transcription-PCR, and cDNA microarrays indicated that arsenite alters the expression of a number of genes associated with cell growth, such as c-fos, c-jun, and EGR-1, as well as cell arrest, such as GADD153 and GADD45. The proliferation-enhancing effect of arsenic on uroepithelial cells likely contributes to its ability to cause cancer.
The health benefits of fruits and vegetables have been the subject of numerous investigations over many years. Two natural substances, quercetin (a flavonoid) and citrus pectin (a polysaccharide found in the cell wall of plants) are of particular interest to cancer researchers. Two modified versions of these substances - quercetin chalcone (QC) and a pH-modified citrus pectin (MCP) - are the focus of this study. Previous research has confirmed that quercetin exhibits antitumor properties, likely due to immune stimulation, free radical scavenging, alteration of the mitotic cycle in tumor cells, gene expression modification, anti-angiogenesis activity, or apoptosis induction, or a combination of these effects. MCP has inhibited metastases in animal studies of prostate cancer and melanoma. To date, no study has demonstrated a reduction in solid tumor growth with MCP, and there is no research into the antitumor effect of QC. This study examines the effects of MCP and QC on the size and weight of colon-25 tumors implanted in balb-c mice. Fifty mice were orally administered either 1 ml distilled water (controls), low-dose QC (0.8 mg/ml), high-dose QC (1.6 mg/ml), low-dose MCP (0. 8 mg/ml) or high-dose MCP (1.6 mg/ml) on a daily basis, beginning the first day of tumor palpation (usually eight days post-implantation). A significant reduction in tumor size was noted at day 20 in all groups compared to controls. The groups given low-dose QC and MCP had a 29-percent (NS) and 38-percent (p<0.02) decrease in size, respectively. The high-dose groups had an even more impressive reduction in size; 65 percent in the QC group and 70 percent in the mice given MCP (both p<0.001). This is the first evidence that MCP can reduce the growth of solid primary tumors, and the first research showing QC has antitumor activity. Additional research on these substances and their effect on human cancers is warranted.
O6-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (alkyltransferase) provides an important source of resistance to some cancer chemotherapeutic alkylating agents. Folate ester derivatives of O6-benzyl-2'-deoxyguanosine and of O6-[4-(hydroxymethyl)benzyl]guanine were synthesized and tested for their ability to inactivate human alkyltransferase. Inactivation of alkyltransferase by the gamma-folate ester of O6-[4-(hydroxymethyl)benzyl]guanine was similar to that of the parent base. The gamma-folate esters of O6-benzyl-2'-deoxyguanosine were more potent alkyltransferase inactivators than the parent nucleoside. The 3'-ester was considerably more potent than the 5'-ester and was more than an order of magnitude more active than O6-benzylguanine, which is currently in clinical trials to enhance therapy with alkylating agents. They were also able to sensitize human tumor cells to killing by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, with O6-benzyl-3'-O-(gamma-folyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine being most active. These compounds provide a new class of highly water-soluble alkyltransferase inactivators and form the basis to construct more tumor-specific and potent compounds targeting this DNA repair protein.
Doxurubicin is an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent. However, use of this drug is often limited by its cardiotoxic side effects. We have observed that an early event accompanying doxorubicin cardiomyopathy is a selective decrease in levels of muscle gene transcripts in cardiac tissue (Ito et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 4275-4279). Since this decrease precedes ultrastructural evidence of cardiac damage, measurements of muscle transcripts might assist in the clinical evaluation of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. We have therefore assessed the utility of the polymerase chain reaction in the measurement of mRNA in control and doxorubicin-treated animals. These measurements were performed on small tissue samples that simulate endomyocardial biopsies. We measured cardiac alpha-actin transcripts as a fraction of ferritin heavy chain transcripts using the method described by Chelly et al. (Nature 333: 858-860, 1988). 0.5 micrograms of total RNA, an amount equivalent to that obtainable from a typical endomyocardial biopsy, was efficiently co-amplified with cardiac alpha-actin and ferritin heavy chain specific primers. The cardiac alpha-actin/ferritin heavy chain ratio calculated from the PCR results correlated well (R = 0.981) with results obtained using Northern blot analysis of 10 micrograms RNA. The correlation was maintained over a wide range of cardiac alpha-actin transcript abundance. These results show that mRNA from cardiac tissue can be estimated by the polymerase chain reaction, even from a small, endomyocardial biopsy-sized sample.
