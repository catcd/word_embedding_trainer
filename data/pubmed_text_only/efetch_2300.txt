A pilot comparison of the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate (MPH) combined with clonidine, clonidine monotherapy, or MPH monotherapy in 6- to 16-year-old children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comorbid aggressive oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder was completed. Study design was a 3-month, randomized, blinded, group comparison with eight subjects per group. No placebo comparison was used. All three treatment groups showed significant improvements in attention deficits, impulsivity, oppositional, and conduct disordered symptoms as assessed by parent and teacher rating scales and laboratory measures. Significant differences among treatment groups were found only on a few measures. Only the clonidine monotherapy group showed significantly decreased fine motor speed. These results suggest the safety and efficacy of clonidine alone or in combination with MPH for the treatment of ADHD and aggressive oppositional and conduct disorders.
To date, Fraser syndrome (FS) and Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome (AMS) have been considered distinct disorders, but they share strikingly similar patterns of congenital abnormalities, specifically craniofacial anomalies. While recent research has led to the identification of the genes FRAS1 and FREM2 as the cause of FS, the genetic basis of AMS continues to be enigmatic. We report on the concurrence of AMS-like and Fraser phenotypes in a Brazilian family. Both affected sibs were homozygous for a novel splice site mutation in the FRAS1 gene. Extensive studies on mRNA expression indicated that this mutation most likely leads to loss of function as most previously reported FRAS1 mutations associated with FS. We conclude that a phenotype resembling AMS is a rare clinical expression of FS with no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation. However, the molecular basis of "true" AMS which has been reported as a sporadic disorder in all cases but one, and so far with no relation to FS, is probably different and still needs to be further investigated.
Despite their long history of chronic use, little information is available regarding the carcinogenicity of opioid analgesics. Oxymorphone is a potent morphinan-type mu-opioid analgesic used for treatment of moderate-to-severe pain. Oxymorphone was tested for carcinogenicity in Crl:CD IGS BR rats and CD-1 mice. Oxymorphone hydrochloride was administered orally once daily for 2 years to rats at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg/day (males) and 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day (females), and mice at 10, 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day (65 animals per sex per group; 100 animals per sex in controls). In rats, survival was generally higher than controls in oxymorphone-treated groups, attributable to lower body weight gain. In mice, survival was generally higher than controls in females at all doses and males given < or = 25 mg/kg/day but lower in males given > or = 75 mg/kg/day due to a high incidence of obstructive uropathy. Opioid-related clinical signs and reduced body weight gain occurred in both species throughout the study. Nonneoplastic findings associated with oxymorphone pharmacology included ocular and pulmonary changes in rats considered secondary to inhibition of blinking and mydriasis, and antitussive activity, respectively, and urinary tract and renal findings in mice considered secondary to urinary retention. There was no target organ toxicity, and no increase in any neoplastic lesions attributed to oxymorphone. Plasma oxymorphone levels achieved in these studies exceeded those in patients taking high therapeutic doses of oxymorphone (Area under the curve [AUC(0-24 h)] values up to 5.6-fold and 64-fold in rats and mice, respectively). Oxymorphone is not considered to be carcinogenic in rats or mice under the conditions of these studies.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors increase synaptic levels of acetylcholine (ACh) by inhibiting its breakdown. Donepezil is a reversible AChE inhibitor that is clinically available and relatively selective for inhibiting AChE but not other cholinesterases. Because AChE inhibitors have been shown to decrease the reinforcing effects of cocaine in animals, our hypothesis was that pretreatment with donepezil would attenuate the perceived value and other positive subjective effects of cocaine. We conducted a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, laboratory-based evaluation of the subjective effects produced by intravenous cocaine in human subjects receiving oral donepezil. Following three days of daily treatment with 5mg of donepezil or oral placebo, participants received intravenous placebo or cocaine (0.18 and 0.36 mg/kg). After a three-day washout period, participants were crossed over to the opposite oral treatment, which was followed by identical intravenous infusions. Donepezil was well-tolerated with only two drug-related adverse events reported that were mild and self-limiting. Treatment with donepezil increased ratings of 'any' and 'good' drug effect produced by low-dose cocaine, without modifying the response to high-dose cocaine. When collapsed across intravenous dose, treatment with donepezil decreased dysphoric effects and somatic symptoms, but did not modify the value of cocaine injections as determined by the Multiple Choice Questionnaire (MCQ). In summary, pretreatment with donepezil potentiated some measures for nonspecific and positive effects of low-dose cocaine. Across all intravenous treatments, participants receiving donepezil reported fewer somatic-dysphoric effects. Neither of these actions support the value of donepezil as a treatment for cocaine dependence.
To report a case of sequential anterior ischemic optic neuropathy temporally related to the sequential use of a decongestant nasal spray.
A 43-year-old woman was evaluated for sequential bilateral vision loss following the use of oxymetazoline nasal spray.
Thorough investigation of possible etiologies causing the bilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was negative. Our patient had several predisposing risk factors for ischemic optic neuropathy, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and crowded optic nerve heads. Before each acute optic neuropathy, the patient used two to three puffs of oxymetazoline nasal spray.
Decongestants have been associated with ischemic and hemorrhagic vascular events. Vasoconstriction secondary to oxymetazoline use may precipitate anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
Occurrence of disease complications in the abdominal aorta in Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1, is relatively rare. We hypothesized that Marfan syndrome could affect the structure, vasomotor function and mechanical property of the abdominal aorta.
Abdominal aorta from mice at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age, heterozygous for the Fbn1 allele encoding a cysteine substitution (Fbn1(C1039G/+), Marfan mice, n = 50), were compared with those from age-matched control littermates (n = 50). Marfan abdominal aorta demonstrated pronounced elastic fiber degradation and disorganization, concomitant with an increased aortic stiffness during aging. In the isometric force measurement, vasoconstriction in response to membrane depolarization or phenylephrine stimulation was similar in both Marfan and control abdominal aorta. However, Marfan abdominal aorta was less sensitive to the inhibition of the phenylephrine-induced contraction by indomethacin and SQ-29548, during which the release of thromboxane A(2) was one half of that of the controls. Nevertheless, the protein expression of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 detected by Western immunoblotting was not different between the 2 strains.
We demonstrated that Marfan syndrome affected abdominal aorta with respect to matrix elastic fiber organization, aortic stiffness and release of thromboxane A(2).
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two hormone replacement therapies on the intermediate end points of coronary heart disease and mammary gland hyperplasia in postmenopausal monkeys.
Surgically postmenopausal cynomolgus monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 12 months while receiving no treatment (control, n = 19), conjugated equine estrogens plus continuous medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 19), or ethinyl estradiol plus norethindrone acetate (n = 21) at doses that were scaled from those doses taken by women.
Quantitative coronary angiography revealed that the arteries of the control group and the conjugated equine estrogens plus continuous medroxyprogesterone acetate-treated animals constricted in response to acetylcholine (-5.4% +/- 1.4% and -6.2% +/- 1.5%, respectively), whereas those arteries in the animals in the ethinyl estradiol plus norethindrone acetate group did not (P =.002). The incidence of dobutamine-induced ST-segment depression in the ethinyl estradiol plus norethindrone acetate group (10.5%) was significantly less than in the control group (68.8%, P =.001) or the conjugated equine estrogens plus continuous medroxyprogesterone acetate group (50%, P =.01). Conjugated equine estrogens plus continuous medroxyprogesterone acetate, but not ethinyl estradiol plus norethindrone acetate, induced diffuse epithelial tissue proliferation in the mammary glands (P =.0006).
Ethinyl estradiol plus norethindrone acetate protected against atherosclerosis-induced endothelium-mediated vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and heart rate-induced myocardial ischemia and did not induce epithelial tissue proliferation (tissue density) in the mammary gland.
We evaluated the role of dopamine systems in the propagation of epileptic Focal, limbic seizures were produced by systemically administered pilocarpine (200 mg/kg, i.p.); as previously described this dose produces limbic stereotypes but neither convulsions nor seizure-related brain damage. The systemic pretreatment with D-1, but not D-2, agonists induced convulsions identical to those produced by a higher, convulsant dose of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg). Conversely, the pretreatment with D-1 receptor antagonists prevented the convulsions whereas the D-2 antagonists facilitated the pilocarpine-induced seizures. Furthermore, we studied the effects of intracerebral injections of dopamine agents on seizures induced by pilocarpine. Nigral microinjection of D-1 agonists strongly induced motor seizures in rats treated with the low dose of pilocarpine. On the other hand, microinjection of D-1 antagonists prevented the motor seizures induced by the high dose of pilocarpine. This study indicates that the two dopamine receptor subtypes, D-1 and D-2, exert opposing roles in the control of epilepsy propagation. Substantia nigra pars reticulata appears to be primarily involved in the dopamine-mediated modulation of seizures.
The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of hearing loss in children and young adults with beta-thalassemia major.
One hundred and four (104) patients aged 6-35 years (mean 17,2 years) participated in the study. All patients were on a regular transfusion-chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9.5 gr/dl. Subjects were receiving desferrioxamine (DFO) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50-60 mg/kg, 5-6 days a week during the first six years of the study, which was then reduced to 40-50 mg/kg for the following eight years. Patients were followed for 8-14 years.
Overall, 21 out of 104 patients (20.2%) presented with high frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), either unilateral or bilateral. No ototoxic factor, other than DFO, was present in any of the patients. Patients with SNHL presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing, however, no statistically significant difference was observed. Subjects with SNHL were submitted to DFO reduction or temporary withdrawal. Following intervention, 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered, 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation.
The findings are indicative of DFO's contributing role in the development of hearing impairment. Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all thalassemic patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse hearing impairment.
Environmental exposure to some persistent organic pollutants has been reported to be associated with a metabolic syndrome in the U.S. population.
We evaluated the associations of body burden levels of dioxins and related compounds with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the general population in Japan.
We conducted a cross-sectional study with 1,374 participants not occupationally exposed to these pollutants, living throughout Japan during 2002-2006. In fasting blood samples, we measured biochemical factors and determined lipid-adjusted concentrations of 10 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), 7 polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and 12 dioxin-like poly-chlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) all of which have toxic equivalency factors. We also performed a questionnaire survey.
The toxic equivalents (TEQs) of PCDDs, PCDFs, and DL-PCBs and total TEQs had significant adjusted associations with metabolic syndrome, whether or not we excluded diabetic subjects. By analyzing each component of metabolic syndrome separately, the DL-PCB TEQs and total TEQs were associated with all components, and the odds ratios (ORs) in the highest quartile of DL-PCB TEQs in four of the five components were higher than those for PCDDs or PCDFs. We also found congener-specific associations with metabolic syndrome; in particular, the highest quartiles of PCB-126 and PCB-105 had adjusted ORs of 9.1 and 7.3, respectively.
These results suggest that body burden levels of dioxins and related compounds, particularly those of DL-PCBs, are associated with metabolic syndrome. Of the components, high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, and glucose intolerance were most closely associated with these pollutants.
Recent data indicate that chronic low-level exposure to lead is associated with accelerated declines in cognition in older age, but this has not been examined in women.
We examined biomarkers of lead exposure in relation to performance on a battery of cognitive tests among older women.
Patella and tibia bone lead--measures of cumulative exposure over many years--and blood lead, a measure of recent exposure, were assessed in 587 women 47-74 years of age. We assessed their cognitive function 5 years later using validated telephone interviews.
Mean +/- SD lead levels in tibia, patella, and blood were 10.5 +/- 9.7 microg/g bone, 12.6 +/- 11.6 microg/g bone, and 2.9 +/- 1.9 microg/dL, respectively, consistent with community-level exposures. In multivariable-adjusted analyses of all cognitive tests combined, levels of all three lead biomarkers were associated with worse cognitive performance. The association between bone lead and letter fluency score differed dramatically from the other bone lead-cognitive score associations, and exclusion of this particular score from the combined analyses strengthened the associations between bone lead and cognitive performance. Results were statistically significant only for tibia lead: one SD increase in tibia lead corresponded to a 0.051-unit lower standardized summary cognitive score (95% confidence interval: -0.099 to -0.003; p = 0.04), similar to the difference in cognitive scores we observed between women who were 3 years apart in age.
These findings suggest that cumulative exposure to lead, even at low levels experienced in community settings, may have adverse consequences for women's cognition in older age.
Pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) aggravate clinical courses in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Endothelin 1 enhances PPH by vasoconstriction and proliferation of vessel walls. Up-regulation of pulmonary Endothelin Receptors A and B (EDNRA, EDNRB) has been reported in human CDH and animal models, but the onset of those alterations during lung development remains unclear. We hypothesized that pulmonary expression of EDNRA and EDNRB is up-regulated at early gestational stages in the nitrofen model.
Pregnant rats were exposed to nitrofen or vehicle on gestational day 9 (D9). Embryos were sacrificed on D15, D18 and D21 and divided into nitrofen- and control group. Pulmonary RNA was extracted and mRNA levels of EDNRA and EDNRB were determined by real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry for protein expression of both receptors was performed.
mRNA levels of EDNRA and EDNRB were significantly increased in the nitrofen group on D15, D18 and D21. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased pulmonary vascular expression of EDNRA and EDNRB compared to controls.
Altered expression of EDNRA and EDNRB is an early event in lung morphogenesis in the nitrofen model. We speculate that pulmonary arteries in CDH become excessively muscularised in early fetal life, becoming unable to adapt normally at birth.
Perfluoroalkanoates, [e.g., perfluorooctanoate (PFOA)], are known peroxisome proliferators that induce hepatomegaly and hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents, and are classic non-genotoxic carcinogens that inhibit in vitro gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). This inhibition of GJIC is known to be a function of perfluorinated carbon lengths ranging from 7 to 10.
The aim of this study was to determine if the inhibition of GJIC by PFOA but not perfluoropentanoate (PFPeA) observed in F344 rat liver cells in vitro also occurs in F344 rats in vivo and to determine mechanisms of PFOA dysregulation of GJIC using in vitro assay systems.
We used an incision load/dye transfer technique to assess GJIC in livers of rats exposed to PFOA and PFPeA. We used in vitro assays with inhibitors of cell signaling enzymes and antioxidants known to regulate GJIC to identify which enzymes regulated PFOA-induced inhibition of GJIC.
PFOA inhibited GJIC and induced hepatomegaly in rat livers, whereas PFPeA had no effect on either end point. Serum biochemistry of liver enzymes indicated no cytotoxic response to these compounds. In vitro analysis of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) indicated that PFOA, but not PFPeA, can activate the extracellular receptor kinase (ERK). Inhibition of GJIC, in vitro, by PFOA depended on the activation of both ERK and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) in the dysregulation of GJIC in an oxidative-dependent mechanism.
The in vitro analysis of GJIC, an epigenetic marker of tumor promoters, can also predict the in vivo activity of PFOA, which dysregulated GJIC via ERK and PC-PLC.
To evaluate the efficacy of trimetazidine (TMZ) in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with high serum creatinine levels undergoing coronary angiography/angioplasty.
TMZ (20 mg thrice daily) was administered orally for 72 h starting 48 h before the procedure. All patients were given intravenous saline (0.9%) at a rate of 1 ml/kg of body weight per hour for 24 h starting 12 h beforehand. Serum creatinine levels were measured before the procedure, 48 h and 7 days after the procedure. Increase in serum creatinine level exceeding 0.5 mg/day or one quarter of the basal value is considered as CIN. Venous blood samples for serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) measurement were drawn before and after coronary angiography.
Basal serum creatinine levels and TAC were similar in TMZ and control groups. Serum creatinine levels in the control group increased significantly 2 days after the procedure, and returned to the baseline values on the seventh day. However, it did not change significantly on the second day, and even significantly decreased on the seventh day in the TMZ group. CIN developed in 2.5% (1/40) of patients in the TMZ group and in 16.6% (7/42) of patients in the control group (p<0.05). TAC values were not different between treatment groups.
TMZ along with isotonic saline infusion is more effective than isotonic saline alone in reducing the risk of CIN in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction.
Arsenic compounds are classified as toxicants and human carcinogens. Environmental exposure to arsenic imposes a big health issue worldwide. Sinapic acid is a phenylpropanoid compound and is found in various herbal materials and high-bran cereals. It has been reported that sinapic acid has antioxidant efficacy as metal chelators due to the orientation of functional groups. However, it has not yet been examined in experimental animals. In light of this fact, the purpose of this study was to characterize the protective role of sinapic acid against arsenic induced toxicity in rats. Rats were orally treated with arsenic alone (5mg/kg body weight (bw)/day) plus sinapic acid at different doses (10, 20 and 40mg/kg bw/day) for 30days. Hepatotoxicity was measured by the increased activities of serum hepatospecific enzymes namely aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase and total bilirubin along with increased elevation of lipid peroxidative markers, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid hydroperoxides, protein carbonyl content and conjugated dienes. The toxic effect of arsenic was also indicated by significantly decreased activities of enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase along with non-enzymatic antioxidant like reduced glutathione. Administration of sinapic acid exhibited significant reversal of arsenic induced toxicity in hepatic tissue. The effect at a dose of 40mg/kgbw/day was more pronounced than the other two doses (10 and 20mg/kgbw/day). All these changes were supported by reduction of arsenic concentration and histopathological observations of the liver. These results suggest that sinapic acid has a protective effect over arsenic induced toxicity in rat.
This study investigated whether data available after the initial electrophysiologic study in patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia could identify those patients in whom serial drug testing is likely to be efficacious. One hundred six patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, whose initial study included short-term drug testing with intravenous procainamide, were evaluated. The baseline arrhythmia induced (in the absence of all antiarrhythmic drugs) was monomorphic tachycardia with a cycle length greater than 200 ms in 81 patients and ventricular flutter or fibrillation in the remaining 25 patients. After intravenous infusion of procainamide (1,250 +/- 300 mg), a ventricular tachyarrhythmia could still be induced in 80 patients during testing with up to three extrastimuli. Serial drug testing with one to four trials of oral conventional and investigational agents was then undertaken. Evaluation of 15 clinical, hemodynamic and electrophysiologic variables by stepwise logistic regression identified two independent predictors of successful response to oral antiarrhythmic drugs: 1) noninducibility of ventricular tachycardia after intravenous procainamide (p less than 0.001), and 2) left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40% (p less than 0.05). Subgroup analysis combining each of these variables identified patients with a high, intermediate or low probability of finding a successful oral drug regimen. Patients whose arrhythmia was suppressed by intravenous procainamide had a 100% likelihood (if left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than or equal to 40%) or an 87% likelihood (if ejection fraction was less than 40%) of responding to an oral regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Cyclophosphamide is a known bladder carcinogen, with cumulative dose directly related to increased risk. There is no consensus, however, on which major cyclophosphamide metabolite (i.e., acrolein or phosphoramide mustard) drives bladder carcinogenesis. We examined 19 cyclophosphamide-related bladder tumors to test the hypothesis that they might contain somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene that could link a specific metabolite to the etiology of these cancers. Forty-three % (9 of 19) of the cases had a mutation in p53, with a predominance at G:C bp (7 of 9, 77%), a preference for non-CpG sites (6 of 7, 86%), and frequent G:C-->A:T transitions (5 of 7, 71%). The p53 mutation spectrum of these cyclophosphamide-associated bladder cancers differed significantly from patterns reported for sporadic (P = 0.020), smoking-related (0.043), and schistosomiasis-linked (P = 0.002) tumors but not arylamine-associated neoplasms (P = 0.860). Differences between the cyclophosphamide and arylamine-associated spectra included an unusual degree of clustering of exon 6 mutations (43% versus 17%, respectively) and an absence of multiple mutations in the former. Notably lacking in our series were G:C-->T:A transversions, the principal mutation associated with acrolein. Instead, the mutation spectrum matches the phosphoramide mustard adduction sequences determined by a repetitive primer-extension assay (P = 0.024), indicating that this metabolite might be a key mutagen in cyclophosphamide-related bladder cancer.
This study aimed to investigate the association of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with serum drug levels and toxicities after high-dose methotrexate (MTX) infusion. The study included 37 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Serum MTX levels and toxicities of bone marrow, liver and kidney were analysed. Genotype analysis of the C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms from genomic DNA of the subjects was performed by real-time PCR. Subjects with MTHFR polymorphism for C677T (CT, TT) had significantly higher MTX levels at 24 h (p = 0.009), and these genotypes did not seem to cause toxicity. Subjects with MTHFR polymorphism for A1298C (AC, CC) had significantly higher MTX levels at 48 h (p = 0.02), and had more grade III/IV anemia (p = 0.02), thrombocytopenia (p = 0.0001), elevated AST levels (p = 0.04) and frequent febrile neutropenic episodes (p = 0.004). The present study suggests that A1298C gene, but not C677T polymorphism is associated with MTX-related toxicity.
Profound postoperative respiratory depression after larger doses of fentanyl was partially reversed by 4-aminopyridine. This reversal was independent of FIO2' suggesting that the response was not dependent upon peripheral chemoreceptor-mediated drive. Similar reversal of fentanyl-induced depression by 4-aminopyridine was observed before surgery in patients breathing 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen. 4-Aminopyridine had no effect on breathing when given alone in the absence of fentanyl to patients breathing 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen before surgery.
Despite generalized consensus that pilocarpine-induced miosis results in some degree of visual field constriction, studies describing the predictability of this occurrence, as well as the nature of the field defects that may be seen, have not been undertaken. We studied 20 normal subjects, ranging in age from 24 to 57 years. Baseline refraction, pupillary measurements, and visual fields were performed in both eyes on a standardized Goldmann perimeter with the I-2e, I-3e, and I-4e test objects. Pilocarpine 2% was then instilled into the study eye and the field repeated at 30 and 120 minutes. An IBM PC computer program, designed by the authors, was used to calculate the area contained within each isopter. The probability of visual field constriction at 30 and 120 minutes after instillation of pilocarpine was found to be significant, especially with pupillary diameters of 2 mm or less. The I-2e isopter was most sensitive to miosis. Visual field constriction persisted with correction of ciliary spasm induced myopia, suggesting that miosis, especially when marked, can independently alter the visual field. The clinician, then, should make every effort to control visual field testing conditions in glaucoma patients on miotics to allow reliable serial comparisons.
Venous bubbles resulting from experimental decompression sickness (DCS) may cause an inflammatory-like reaction with activation of granulocytes and release of metabolites from arachidonic acid. The release of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathway mediated metabolites, namely thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and leukotriene E4 (LTE4) likely contribute to this overall DCS response. In the present study we examined the effect on DCS outcome of several agents affecting both pathways.
Indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid were administered to study the cyclooxygenase pathway mediators, Zafirlukast and Zileuton to study inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway, and isoproterenol for its beta-agonist effects. The agents were administered to randomly selected Sprague-Dawley rats prior to compression to 683 kPa for 60 min. Following 60 min recovery post-decompression, DCS evaluation included: gross symptoms; pulmonary edema; bronchoalveolar lavage and pleural fluid protein; white blood cell and differential cell counts; and urine, bronchoalveolar lavage, and plasma TXB2 and LTE4 analysis.
The results indicate that both Zafirlukast and Zileuton reduced the reported DCS symptoms, pulmonary edema, pleural and bronchoalveolar lavage protein levels, white blood cell counts in the pleural and bronchoalveolar lavage, and leukotriene levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage vs. that of vehicle-treated rats exposed to compression/decompression. The effect of these agents on pleural and bronchial alveolar protein levels demonstrated protective effects on microvascular permeability. Acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin treatment had less effect on reducing inflammatory-induced changes.
The effect of inflammatory-like responses to DCS can be altered with pharmacological intervention given prior to compression.
