In anaesthetized dog, the adrenaline induced hypertension is reversed by both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking agents such as AR-C 239 and yohimbine. After alpha 1 or alpha 2 and beta-blockade, adrenaline induced again an increase in blood pressure. This hypertensive effect was suppressed by an alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent when an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking was responsible for the reversal of adrenaline-induced hypertension, and conversely. After beta-blockade, both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade is necessary for suppressing any tensional effect of adrenaline. On the other hand, alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade are both required to prevent beta-blockade from restoring adrenaline hypertensive effect. Similar effects were observed wih noradrenaline. In fact, only a significant decrease of the noradrenaline-induced hypertension was observed after each alpha-blocker. Both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent also significantly inhibited the hypertension induced by noradrenaline. For completely suppressing the effect of noradrenaline on blood pressure, a combination of alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta-blockade is necessary. These results are compatible with a stimulation by adrenaline and noradrenaline of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors to produce increase in blood pressure.
Cancer metastasis is a complex multi-step process, responsible for a majority of cancer-related deaths by affecting the critical organs and causing complications in therapies. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a multi-factorial disease and is the third most common cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that MMP-2 and MMP-9 are involved in tumor invasion and metastases and their elevated expression has been associated with poor prognosis. Our recent studies showed a strong anti-oxidant and hepatoprotective effects of bacoside A (BA) against carcinogen. Nevertheless the effect of BA on the activities and expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 during hepatocellular carcinoma is not yet recognized. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the same. Results of gelatin zymography study showed that BA co-treatment significantly decreased the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9, which is increased during hepatocellular carcinoma. Further immunoblot analysis showed decreased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in rats co-treated with BA compared to DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. Our results reveal that BA exerts its anti-metastatic effect against DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting the activities and expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
This study investigates whether naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, could render normal controls, normally nonresponsive to panic inducing stimuli, sensitive to the physiological and behavioral effects of sodium lactate, a robust panicogen in panic disorder patients. Twelve normal controls received intravenous naloxone followed by sodium lactate. Four of these subjects underwent a separate infusion with naloxone followed by saline. Respiratory physiological symptoms were measured throughout. Clinical symptoms, assessed by the Acute Panic Inventory (API), an Anxiety Scale, and the Borg Breathlessness Scale, were recorded. Eight of the twelve subjects experienced strong physiological reactivity to naloxone-lactate manifested by significantly increased tidal volume. Concomitant increases in the API and Borg scales were demonstrated; however, fear or anxiety was not affected. The four subjects retested with naloxone followed by saline did not experience significant increases on any measure. These results provide preliminary evidence that endogenous opioid system function may be a key modulator of responsivity to sodium lactate. Dysregulation of the opioid system may potentially underlie critical aspects of panic disorder neurobiology, including respiratory abnormalities and suffocation sensitivity.
The role of statins in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular incidents cannot be questioned. However, it is commonly known, that their use, especially in high doses, can cause side effects. Our study reports the case of female patient who because of an episode of unstable angina underwent the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of right coronary artery (RCA), and afterwards received the hypolipemic treatment of simvastatin in the dose of 80 mg/day. After the PCI she participated in the programme of early sanatory cardiac rehabilitation. After some days of her stay she started to notice the generalized muscle pain, that she initially linked with the intensification of exercise. Two days after finishing the rehabilitation programme she was admitted to our Department with the symptoms of generalized muscle injury. Laboratory test revealed very high serum level of creatine kinase, myoglobin and transaminases. Data obtained from anamnesis and results of laboratory testing enabled to diagnose myopathy being the result of hypolipemic treatment with high dose of simvastatin. After the treatment we observed gradual regression of muscle pain, and in 12th day of the stay in our clinic the normalization of biochemical parameters was stated. Our patient reported she was not informed about the possible complications of undertaken treatment. This case report emphasizes the necessity to precisely inform the patients about the possible drugs side effects.
The concentration of kynurenine, a neuroactive tryptophan metabolite, in blood plasma after pharmacologically induced anxiety was studied. Anxiety was provoked in 15 healthy volunteers by an anxiogenic dose of caffeine. Kynurenine concentration was markedly increased at the peak of anxiety and returned to normal after anxiety had abated. Possible causes responsible for this effect are discussed. There is a correlation between kynurenine concentration in blood plasma and indices of state and trait anxiety (Spielberger-Khanin scale) and anxiety (Hamilton scale) at baseline. The correlation disappears at the peak of anxiety. It is suggested that kynurenine is involved in caffeine-induced anxiety in humans. The absence of correlation at the peak of caffeine-induced anxiety is discussed.
Combination therapy with taurine, epigallocatechin gallate, and genistein was effective in alleviating the progression of liver fibrosis in our previous study. To better understand the anti-fibrotic mechanisms of combination therapy, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach was used to study the expression profiles of proteins in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis rats following combination therapy. The anti-fibrotic effects of combination therapy were assessed directly by liver histology, and indirectly by measurement of serum biochemical markers and antioxidant enzymes. The results showed that combination therapy could significantly improve the liver function, as indicated by decreasing levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and collagen I, increasing levels of total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and reducing the pathological tissue damage. A total of 89 differential expressed proteins in response to combination therapy were identified by iTRAQ, which were interacted with each other and involved in different biological processes and pathways. Four differentially expressed proteins (Tpi1, Txn1, Fgb, and F7) involved in antioxidant defense system, glycolysis pathway and coagulation cascade pathway were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our work provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of combination therapy against liver fibrosis, and the identified targets may be useful for treatment of liver fibrosis in future.
Normalization of proteinuria and even regression of glomerulosclerosis seem to occur in progressive renal disease upon blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Here we quantified the effect of a combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist on renal function and structure in spontaneous overt nephropathy in male Munich Wistar Fromter (MWF) rats.
Three groups of MWF rats were used: group 1 was studied at 25 weeks to provide baseline renal function and structure; group 2 was followed until 40 weeks of age; group 3 was treated with lisinopril (40 mg/L) and valsartan (180 mg/L) in drinking water from 25 to 40 weeks. A group of untreated Wistar rats (group 4, 40 weeks) was used as the control. At the end of the study renal hemodynamics, kidney tissue morphology, accumulation of type III collagen and evaluation of interstitial inflammatory cells were performed.
MWF rats spontaneously developed hypertension, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial volume expansion and protein cast accumulation. Combined treatment completely reversed protein excretion and ameliorated renal plasma flow and the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. The combined therapy was effective in halting progressive glomerulosclerosis, particularly in glomeruli with mild sclerotic lesions, and reduced interstitial volume expansion. Type III collagen accumulation and protein cast also were reversed. Infiltrating cells were massively present in the interstitium already at 25 weeks, and augmented at 40 weeks in untreated rats. Combined treatment reduced infiltrating cells to values comparable to normal controls.
These data indicate that in animals with spontaneous overt nephropathy, Ang II antagonism normalized proteinuria, eliminated inflammatory cell infiltration, and ameliorated glomerular and tubular structural changes.
Inflammatory mediators play a crucial role in ulcerative colitis (UC). The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum 21 (LAB 21) on inflammatory mediators in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. The inflammatory response was assessed by changes in colon morphology, histopathology, and measurement of reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (TBARS), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) mRNA and protein levels by ELISA. Besides, protein expressions of IL-1β and IL-10 were also evaluated by western blot. Treatment with LAB 21 (1×10(10)CFU/rat/day) and sulfasalazine (500mgkg(-1) body weight) for 14days after induction of colitis, significantly decreased TBARS, NO and increased GSH concentration. The protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1β and TNFα were down-regulated, whereas, protein and mRNA expression of IL-10 was up-regulated in LAB 21-treated rats. Moreover, LAB 21 attenuated the macroscopic colonic damage, histopathological changes induced by TNBS. These results suggest that LAB 21 may be effective in the treatment of UC by immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties.
Two patients had ampicillin-associated seizures. Although they had complex medical problems, the high serum concentrations of ampicillin at the time of seizures without their recurrence after discontinuing the antibiotic suggest that the seizures were related to the ampicillin therapy.
Transient reduction in coronary perfusion pressure in the isolated mouse heart increases microvascular resistance (paradoxical vasoconstriction) by an endothelium-mediated mechanism. To assess the presence and extent of paradoxical vasoconstriction in hearts from normal and diabetic rats and to determine whether increased heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression and HO activity, using cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), attenuates coronary microvascular response, male Wistar rats were rendered diabetic with nicotinamide/streptozotocin for 2 wk and either CoPP or vehicle was administered by intraperitoneal injection weekly for 3 wk (0.5 mg/100 g body wt). The isolated beating nonworking heart was submitted to transient low perfusion pressure (20 mmHg), and coronary resistance (CR) was measured. During low perfusion pressure, CR increased and was associated with increased lactate release. In diabetic rats, CR was higher, HO-1 expression and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were downregulated, and inducible nitric oxide synthase and O(2)(-) were upregulated. After 3 wk of CoPP treatment, HO activity was significantly increased in the heart. Upregulation of HO-1 expression and HO activity by CoPP resulted in the abolition of paradoxical vasoconstriction and a reduction in oxidative ischemic damage. In addition, there was a marked increase in serum adiponectin. Elevated HO-1 expression was associated with increased expression of cardiac endothelial nitric oxide synthase, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma extra long, and phospho activator protein kinase levels and decreased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and malondialdehyde. These results suggest a critical role for HO-1 in microvascular tone control and myocardial protection during ischemia in both normal and mildly diabetic rats through the modulation of constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and activity, and an increase in serum adiponectin.
This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects on blood pressure of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg added to valsartan 160 mg or to olmesartan 20 mg in hypertensive patients. After a 2-wk placebo period, 130 patients, aged 35 to 75 y, with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >or=99 and 110 mm Hg were randomly assigned to olmesartan 20 mg once daily or to valsartan 160 mg once daily according to a prospective, parallel-arm study design. After 4 wk of monotherapy, patients whose BP was not controlled (DBP >or=90 mm Hg) were given combination treatment with HCTZ 12.5 mg for an additional 4 wk. At the end of the placebo period and at the end of each treatment period, clinical and ambulatory BP measurements were recorded. At the end of the combination therapy period, venous blood samples were drawn 2, 4, and 24 h after drug intake for evaluation of HCTZ plasma concentrations. Both combinations induced a greater ambulatory BP reduction than monotherapy. However, mean reduction from baseline in the valsartan/HCTZ-treated patients (-21.5)-14.6 mm Hg for 24 h, -21.8/-14.9 mm Hg for daytime, and -20.4/-13.7 mm Hg for nighttime systolic blood pressure [SBP]/DBP) was greater than in the olmesartan/HCTZ-treated patients )-18.8/-12.3 mm Hg for 24 h, -19.3/-12.8 mm Hg for daytime, and 17.4/-10.6 mm Hg for nighttime SBP/DBP). The difference between the effects of the 2 treatments was significant (P<.01). In particular, compared with monotherapy, the add-on effect of HCTZ 12.5 mg was significantly greater in the valsartan group than in those treated with olmesartan; the difference was more evident for nighttime BP values. Plasma concentrations of HCTZ were significantly greater with valsartan than with olmesartan at each determination time (P<.05). These findings suggest that the addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg to valsartan 160 mg monotherapy produces a greater BP reduction than the addition of the same dose of HCTZ to olmesartan 20 mg monotherapy.
The present study examines postoperative pain experience following 243 gingivectomies in Norwegian patients using possible combinations of 3 local anaesthetics (lidocaine-adrenalin, prilocaine-felypressin or mepivacaine) and 3 periodontal dressings (Coe-pak, Wondrpak or Nobetec). When Coe-pak was used, the mean pain score was higher (P less than 0.05) in the group treated with lidocaine-adrenalin 4 to 6 h after gingivectomy than the groups treated with prilocaine-felypressin or mepivacaine. There was no significant difference between the groups treated with prilocaine-felypressin or mepivacaine. When Wondrpak or Nobetec were used, there was no significant difference between any of the local anaesthetics used. The present finding shows that the local anaesthetic combination of lidocaine-adrenalin (1:80,000) gives rise to a higher mean postoperative pain experience after gingivectomy than prilocaine-felypressin or mepivacaine. However, the relative difference in pain experience seen after gingivectomy when using the present local anaesthetic agents is masked when using an eugenol-containing periodontal dressing. Thus, the higher pain experience reported after lidocaine-adrenalin may only be clinically important when using periodontal dressings without local anaesthetic components such as eugenol.
Reversible protein phosphorylation is an essential regulatory mechanism in many cellular functions. In contrast to protein kinases, the role and regulation of protein phosphatases has remained ambiguous. To address this issue, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress the catalytic subunit alpha of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (PP2Acalpha) in the heart driven by the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. Overexpression of the PP2Acalpha gene in the heart led to increased levels of the transgene both at RNA and protein levels. This was accompanied by a significant increase of PP2A enzyme activity in the myocardium. Morphological analysis revealed isles of necrosis and fibrosis. The phosphorylation state of phospholamban, troponin inhibitor, and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 was reduced significantly. The expression of junctional (calsequestrin) and free SR proteins (SERCA and phospholamban) was not altered. Whereas no increase in morbidity or mortality was noted, transgenic mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and reduced contractility of the heart, as well as cardiac dilatation as shown by biplane echocardiography. Taken together, these findings are indicative of the fundamental role of PP2A in cardiac function and imply that disturbances in protein phosphatases expression and activity may cause or aggravate the course of cardiac diseases.
The zebrafish embryo (ZFE) is a promising alternative, non-rodent model in toxicology, which has an advantage over the traditionally used models as it contains complete biological complexity and provides a medium to high-throughput setting. Here, we assess how the ZFE compares to the traditionally used models for liver toxicity testing, i.e., in vivo mouse and rat liver, in vitro mouse and rat hepatocytes, and primary human hepatocytes. For this comparison, we analyzed gene expression changes induced by three model compounds for cholestasis, steatosis, and necrosis. The three compounds, cyclosporine A, amiodarone, and acetaminophen, were chosen because of their relevance to human toxicity and these compounds displayed hepatotoxic-specific changes in the mouse in vivo data. Compound induced expression changes in the ZFE model shared similarity with both in vivo and in vitro. Comparison on single gene level revealed the presence of model specific changes and no clear concordance across models. However, concordance was identified on the pathway level. Specifically, the pathway "regulation of metabolism - bile acids regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism via FXR" was affected across all models and compounds. In conclusion, our study with three hepatotoxic model compounds shows that the ZFE model is at least as comparable to traditional models in identifying hepatotoxic activity and has the potential for use as a pre-screen to determine the hepatotoxic potential of compounds.
Prostaglandin E2 injected in the rat paw causes hyperalgesia which is antagonized by local injections of opiate and opiate antagonists. In the present investigation in rats it is shown that naloxone has an analgesic effect at doses as low as 2 micrograms/site, injected into the rat hind paw. At a dose that has no analgesic effect (1 microgram/site) naloxone antagonized the analgesia produced by either local or systemic administration of morphine. Local administration of levorphanol (50 micrograms/site) caused a 50% reduction in the intensity of the hyperalgesia induced by prostaglandin E2. A dose four times greater of its isomer, dextrorphan, had little analgesic effect. The present results support the suggestion that this peripheral analgesia is the result of an action of opiates in receptors located at the nociceptors.
Management of Graves' ophthalmopathy includes high-dose glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids may have many side effects, and therefore their use should always be carefully considered. Here we present the case of a woman who received high doses of methylprednisolone (1 g iv daily) for active Graves' ophthalmopathy, and developed severe hypertension followed by myocardial infarction on the fifth day of treatment. Before the myocardial infarction, the patient was in good condition, normotensive, non-diabetic, non-obese. Except hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment (euthyroid under substitutional therapy), she suffered from no other diseases. There had been one episode of chest discomfort in her past history. We conclude that myocardial infarction may develop in patients treated with high-dose glucocorticoids for Graves' ophthalmopathy, and increased blood pressure may herald this complication.
Patients with a high plasma adiponectin have a poor prognosis in chronic heart failure (CHF). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are reported to increase the plasma adiponectin concentration, but the effect of beta-blockers on plasma adiponectin in patients with CHF remains unknown.
Blood samples were collected at before and 6 months after administration of carvedilol in 44 CHF patients. The hemodynamic parameters, echocardiography, plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), norepinephrine and adiponectin were measured. Six months after treatment, there were significantly decreased plasma concentrations of adiponectin (15.8 +/-1.4 to 11.0 +/-1.1 microg/ml, P<0.0001), BNP and norepinephrine and increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). On stepwise multivariable analyses, a higher plasma adiponectin concentration before treatment (rs=-0.561, P<0.0001) was a significant independent predictor of a greater decrease in adiponectin concentration and the decrease in plasma adiponectin concentration was significantly correlated with the improvement of LVEF (r=-0.561, P<0.0001).
These findings indicate that carvedilol decreases plasma adiponectin concentration and that the decrease in plasma adiponectin is associated with the improvement of LVEF after treatment with carvedilol in CHF patients.
The toxic effect of the Ziram fungicide (Zn-dimethyldithiocarbamate) on fertility, its lethal and teratogenic potential were tested on two mouse strains, C3H and AK. The fungicide was administered by gavage to male mice in daily doses of 0.2 mg% and 0.1 mg% along three weeks, then the mice were mated with normal females. Ziram induced changes in the testes and meiotic chromosomes. From among the mated females, 80 per cent of the C3H mice and 20 per cent of the AK remained unfertilized. The dominant lethals have a higher incidence in the AK strain. The skeletal malformation induced were kyphosis, scoliosis, sternum ossification failure; retardation in skeletal development is more obvious in the AK strain.
The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor achaete-scute homologue-1 (ASH1) plays a critical role in regulating the neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype in normal and neoplastic lung. Transgenic (TG) mice that constitutively express human ASH1 (hASH1) under control of the Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10) promoter in non-NE airway lining cells display progressive epithelial hyperplasia and bronchiolar metaplasia or bronchiolization of the alveoli (BOA). However, little is known about the involvement of hASH1 in regeneration of the conducting airway. In this study, we investigated the impact of hASH1 on airway cell injury and repair in the TG mice following an intraperitoneal injection of naphthalene, which specifically ablates bronchiolar Clara cells and induces pulmonary NE cell hyperplasia. We discovered an overall attenuation of NE maturation coupled with increased proliferation in TG mice during post-naphthalene repair. In addition, BOA lesions revealed enhanced epithelial cell proliferation while preserving Clara cell markers CC10 and the principal naphthalene-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P4502F2. These data suggest that ASH1 may play an important role in maintaining a progenitor phenotype that promotes renewal of both NE and epithelial cells. Moreover, ASH1 may propagate a stem cell microenvironment in BOA where epithelium becomes resistant to naphthalene toxicity.
Since parenteral beta 2-adrenergic stimulation can induce hypokalemia, we postulated that administration of beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists by inhalation could induce the same. We administered the usual clinical doses of three commonly used bronchodilators to each of six subjects receiving assisted mechanical ventilation in line with the ventilator: two beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonists, metaproterenol, 5 percent solution, and isoetharine, 1 percent solution; and the anticholinergic agent atropine as a control. Each bronchodilator was nebulized over 10 to 15 minutes in random order, four hours apart, and given to every subject. Plasma potassium was measured at five-minute intervals and arterial blood gases at 15-minute intervals, for a total of 50 minutes after administration of each bronchodilator. Following administration of each drug, plasma potassium showed an average decline. The mean decline in plasma potassium from baseline was statistically significant for metaproterenol (p = 0.04) and atropine (p = 0.001) but not for isoetharine (p = 0.09). Although there were no statistically significant differences among the declines in plasma potassium induced by the three drugs, metaproterenol caused the greatest decline (-0.6 mEq/L).
Antibiotic forms of tetracycline exhibit antitumor activity in some tumor models. However, their low in vivo efficacy and associated morbidity limit their long-term application in cancer therapy. This report appraises the efficacy of doxycycline (DC) and non-antimicrobial, chemically modified tetracyclines (CMTs) against prostate cancer. Both DC and several CMTs inhibited prostate tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Some of the CMTs were significantly more potent than DC. One of the CMTs, 6-deoxy, 6-demethyl, 4-de-dimethylamino tetracycline (CMT-3, COL-3), was the most potent inhibitor (50% inhibition dose [GI(50)] < or = 5.0 ,microg/ml). Exposure of tumor cells to CMT-3 induced both apoptosis and necrosis. Mitochondrial depolarization and increased levels of reactive hydroxyl radicals were also observed in cells treated with CMT-3. Cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) compartment was observed in CMT-3- and DC-treated cells. DC and CMTs also inhibited the invasive potential of the tumor cells in vitro, from 10% (CMT-6) to >90% (CMT-3). CMT-3 and DC decreased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 secretion in treated cultures and inhibited activity of secreted MMPs, CMT-3 was a stronger inhibitor. Daily oral gavage of DC and CMT-3 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in the Dunning MAT LyLu rat prostate tumor. Decreases in tumor growth (27-35%) and lung metastases were observed (28.9 +/- 15.4 sites/animal [CMT-3-treated] versus 43.6 +/- 18.8 sites/animal [DC-treated] versus 59.5 +/- 13.9 [control]; p < 0.01]. A delay in tumor growth (27 +/- 9.3%, p < 0.05), reduction in metastases (58 +/- 8%) and decrease in tumor incidences (55 +/- 9%, CMT-3-treated) were also observed, when rats were predosed for 7 days. No significant drug-induced morbidity was observed in any of the animals. These results, along with a recently concluded clinical trial, suggest a potential use of CMT-3 as an oral, nontoxic drug to treat metastatic prostate and other cancers.
Fenoldopam, a dopamine-1 (D1) agonist, was administered by a 6-h intravenous infusion to patients with refractory hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 115 mmHg while on triple therapy] in order to achieve a fall in DBP of 30 mmHg. The evolution of blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), urine volume, renal excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, uric acid, phosphate, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone and prolactin were evaluated. A significant fall in blood pressure (P less than 0.01) accompanied by an increase in heart rate (P less than 0.01) was attained after 30 min. GFR and RPF increased significantly (P less than 0.01) but the filtration fraction fell. Urine volume and urinary output of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, uric acid and phosphate increased markedly (P less than 0.01). Meanwhile, plasma potassium fell (P less than 0.01) and the hormonal parameters showed no significant change. We concluded that in refractory hypertension fenoldopam has potent renal and systemic vasodilatory properties through which blood pressure falls. The hypotensive effect of fenoldopam is also facilitated by its marked diuretic and natriuretic properties. The absence of variations of plasma prolactin confirm the D1 selectivity of fenoldopam and the lack of increase in PRA indicates that fenoldopam blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Epidemiological studies indicate that exposure to environmental pollutants such as pesticides and dioxins leads to the pathogenesis of lymphoma and leukemia. Here, we show that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) resulted in loss of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) response in three different lymphoma cell lines, which plays a key role in the development of cancer, especially lymphoma and leukemia. The AhR-mediated inhibition of apoptosis in vitro was associated with a clear increase of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and deregulation of genes of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family involved in apoptosis including Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 in several lymphoma cell lines. Treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 and the AhR antagonist 3'-methoxy-4'-nitroflavone abolished the TCDD-induced resistance of apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, using micropositron emission tomography imaging, in vivo findings demonstrated that exposure to TCDD promotes the development of lymphoma in superficial lymph nodes of C57BL/10J mice, which was associated with a marked increase of COX-2 expression in the affected lymph nodes. The results indicate that AhR activation and COX-2 overexpression likely represent a mechanism of resistance to apoptosis in lymphoma cell lines that might be relevant for the development of lymphoma in vivo.
Plasma levels of adrenomedullin, a potent vasodilator peptide, are increased in cirrhotic patients, whereas its role in vascular hyporeactivity in cirrhosis has not been clarified.
Adrenomedullin expression was evaluated by radioimmunoassay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Vascular reactivity to phenylephrine, alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, was investigated in the aortic rings from control rats and CCl-induced cirrhotic rats with ascites in the presence of the neutralizing antibody against adrenomedullin, human adrenomedullin and/or N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.
Plasma adrenomedullin levels were significantly higher in cirrhotic rats than in controls (16.3 +/- 2.9 versus 7.4 +/- 1.7 fmol/mL, P < 0.05) and correlated negatively with systemic arterial pressure (r = -0.62, P < 0.05). Gene expression of adrenomedullin in various organs (liver, kidney, lung) and vessels (portal vein, aorta) was enhanced in cirrhotic rats compared with controls. Neutralizing antibody against adrenomedullin ameliorated the blunted contractile response to phenylephrine in cirrhotic aorta (Rmax: 1.5 +/- 0.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.1 g/mg tissue, P < 0.05), whereas contraction remained unchanged in control aorta (Rmax: 1.9 +/- 0.2 versus 1.9 +/- 0.2 g/mg tissue). Intravenous infusion of human adrenomedullin induced a reduction of mean arterial pressure together with an increase of serum nitrate levels, which was abolished by neutralizing antibody against adrenomedullin. Human adrenomedullin caused a blunted contractile response to phenylephrine in both control and cirrhotic aortas, which was not observed in the presence of N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.
These findings indicate that the overproduction of adrenomedullin may contribute to vascular hyporeactivity in cirrhosis via a release of nitric oxide.
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a label for a group of diseases caused by a large number of mutations that result in rod photoreceptor cell death followed by gradual death of cones. The mechanism of cone cell death is uncertain. Rods are a major source of oxygen utilization in the retina and, after rods die, the level of oxygen in the outer retina is increased. In this study, we used the rd1 mouse model of RP to test the hypothesis that cones die from oxidative damage. A mixture of antioxidants was selected to try to maximize protection against oxidative damage achievable by exogenous supplements; alpha-tocopherol (200 mg/kg), ascorbic acid (250 mg/kg), Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (10 mg/kg), and alpha-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg). Mice were treated with daily injections of the mixture or each component alone between postnatal day (P)18 and P35. Between P18 and P35, there was an increase in two biomarkers of oxidative damage, carbonyl adducts measured by ELISA and immunohistochemical staining for acrolein, in the retinas of rd1 mice. The staining for acrolein in remaining cones at P35 was eliminated in antioxidant-treated rd1 mice, confirming that the treatment markedly reduced oxidative damage in cones; this was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in cone cell density and a 50% increase in medium-wavelength cone opsin mRNA. Antioxidants also caused some preservation of cone function based upon photopic electroretinograms. These data support the hypothesis that gradual cone cell death after rod cell death in RP is due to oxidative damage, and that antioxidant therapy may provide benefit.
