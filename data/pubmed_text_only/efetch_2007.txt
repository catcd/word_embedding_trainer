Hemodialysis patients with tunneled catheters are at increased risk of bacteremic Staphylococcus aureus infections. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that aspirin has direct antistaphylococcal effects by inhibiting expression of alpha-toxin and matrix adhesion genes through activation of sigma factor B stress-induced operon. We hypothesized that long-term treatment with aspirin may decrease the frequency of S aureus bacteremia in such patients.
We retrospectively analyzed electronic medical records for a variety of clinical parameters, including catheter dwell times, blood culture results, and aspirin use in our dialysis population.
A total of 4,722 blood cultures were performed in 872 patients during more than 476 patient-catheter-years. There was a lower rate of catheter-associated S aureus bacteremia in patients treated with aspirin versus those not treated with aspirin (0.17 versus 0.34 events/patient-catheter-year, P = 0.003), whereas no such difference was observed for other bacteria. This association was dose dependent, seen mostly with the 325-mg aspirin dose. Using the Cox proportional hazard method, risk to develop a first episode of S aureus bacteremia decreased by 54% in patients using aspirin (confidence interval, 24 to 72; P = 0.002). Aspirin was associated with decreased risk of: (1) a first episode of methicillin-resistant S aureus bacteremia and (2) metastatic complications during the first episode of catheter-related S aureus bacteremia.
These data are consistent with our clinical hypothesis that aspirin has a clinically useful antistaphylococcal effect in the dialysis population.
Oligodendrocyte death and demyelination are hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we show that ATP signaling can trigger oligodendrocyte excitotoxicity via activation of calcium-permeable P2X(7) purinergic receptors expressed by these cells. Sustained activation of P2X(7) receptors in vivo causes lesions that are reminiscent of the major features of MS plaques, i.e., demyelination, oligodendrocyte death, and axonal damage. In addition, treatment with P2X(7) antagonists of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, reduces demyelination and ameliorates the associated neurological symptoms. Together, these results indicate that ATP can kill oligodendrocytes via P2X(7) activation and that this cell death process contributes to EAE. Importantly, P2X(7) expression is elevated in normal-appearing axon tracts in MS patients, suggesting that signaling through this receptor in oligodendrocytes may be enhanced in this disease. Thus, P2X(7) receptor antagonists may be beneficial for the treatment of MS.
Withdrawal from morphine evokes increases in Fos-like immunoreactivity in the spinal cord, particularly in the superficial dorsal horn, laminae I/II. To determine the origin of the increased Fos-like immunoreactivity, we selectively targeted central or peripheral opioid receptors with naloxone-methiodide, an antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, or induced withdrawal after eliminating possible sources of input to the superficial dorsal horn. To induce tolerance, we implanted rats with morphine or placebo pellets (75 mg, six pellets over three days). On day 4, withdrawal was precipitated and after 1 h, the rats were killed, their spinal cords removed and 50 microm transverse sections of the spinal cord immunoreacted with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the Fos protein. In placebo-pelleted rats, none of the different procedures, viz. spinal transection, unilateral dorsal rhizotomy (L4-S2), neonatal capsaicin treatment or direct intrathecal opioid antagonist injection, induced expression of the Fos protein. However, both spinally transected and rhizotomized withdrawing animals showed significant increases in Fos-like immunoreactivity in laminae I/II, compared to intact withdrawing rats. Neonatal treatment with capsaicin, which eliminates C-fibres, did not alter Fos-like-immunoreactivity. Selective withdrawal of morphine from peripheral opioid receptors by naloxone-methiodide did not induce Fos-like immunoreactivity in the lumbar spinal cord greater than that recorded in nonwithdrawing rats. However, intrathecal injection of naloxone-methiodide increased Fos-like immunoreactivity in laminae I/II and the ventral horn to a greater extent than did subcutaneous injection of naloxone. We hypothesize that the increased Fos expression after systemic withdrawal in spinally-transected rats results from a loss of descending inhibitory control that is activated during withdrawal. The increase in withdrawal-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity after rhizotomy may be secondary to loss of inhibitory controls exerted by large diameter primary afferents or to deafferentation-induced reorganization in the dorsal horn. Since capsaicin did not alter the magnitude of Fos-like immunoreactivity in withdrawing rats, we conclude that hyperactivity of opioid receptor-laden C-fibres is not a necessary contributor to the withdrawal-induced increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity in laminae I and II. Taken together with the results recorded after intrathecal injection of naloxone-methiodide in tolerant rats, we conclude that the pattern of lumbar spinal cord Fos expression following systemic withdrawal is primarily a consequence of increased activity in opioid receptor-containing circuits intrinsic to the dorsal horn and that the magnitude of Fos expression is normally dampened by supraspinal and primary afferent-derived inhibitory inputs.
Flavopiridol is a protein bound, cytotoxic, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Flavopiridol given by 1-hour bolus at 50 mg/m(2) daily 3 times followed by cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone (FLAM) is active in adults with poor-risk acute leukemias. A pharmacologically derived "hybrid" schedule (30-minute bolus followed by 4-hour infusion) of flavopiridol was more effective than bolus administration in refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our phase 1 trial "hybrid FLAM" in 55 adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias began at a total flavopiridol dose of 50 mg/m(2) per day 3 times (20-mg/m(2) bolus, 30-mg/m(2) infusion). Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at level 6 (30-mg/m(2) bolus, 70-mg/m(2) infusion) with tumor lysis, hyperbilirubinemia, and mucositis. Death occurred in 5 patients (9%). Complete remission occurred in 22 (40%) across all doses. Overall and disease-free survivals for complete remission patients are more than 60% at more than 2 years. Pharmacokinetics demonstrated a dose-response for total and unbound plasma flavopiridol unrelated to total protein, albumin, peripheral blast count, or toxicity. Pharmacodynamically, flavopiridol inhibited mRNAs of multiple cell cycle regulators, but with uniform increases in bcl-2. "Hybrid FLAM" is active in relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, with a recommended "hybrid" dose of bolus 30 mg/m(2) followed by infusion of 60 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days. This clinical trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00470197.
The authors relate eight cases of amineptine dependency collected between 1980 and 1988 in 7 women and 1 man treated in the CHU of Besançon (France). The pharmacodependency appeared to be limited mainly to an abuse and a psychic dependence, i.e. a compulsive need to use the drug on a periodic (two cases) or continuing (six cases) basis in order to experience its psychomotor stimulant like effect. The used dosages ranged between 1,000 and 2,500 mg per day. The daily dose was divided into little doses, every hour for example. The induction modality was progressive during weeks or months and a stable dose period was then encountered. In one patient only, we observed a progressive increase of the dose without stabilisation of the dose. The withdrawal of amineptine was obtained without problem except in 2 cases where we observed clinical manifestations of anxiety, psychomotor agitation or bulimia during one day. Four years after the beginning, amineptine dependence was still present in 2 patients. In 4 patients we obtained an interruption of the amineptine pharmacodependency for one to three years. We did not see again the two remaining patients. In two cases, the main diagnosis, according to DSM III, was a major personality disorder (borderline). In the six other cases the diagnosis was a bipolar affective disorder (including four cases with only hypomanic episodes only). In these six patients the main characteristic of their affective illness was the association with other psychiatric disorders, especially personality disorders, such as borderline personality in one case and atypical personality with uncontrolled behavior as the main feature, in the 5 other patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
It has been suggested that exposure to relatively high levels of unopposed estrogen is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. Combined therapy of estrogen with cyclic progestagen was therefore highly recommended for menopausal women with an intact uterus.
The cases of two postmenopausal women who developed endometrial cancer after taking continuous sequential HRT for 15 months are reported. Both were without bleeding for more than 2 years and presented with a normal vaginal ultrasound. They had severe menopausal symptoms and asked for HRT.
After 15 months irregular bleeding occurred and a hysterectomy was performed. The pathohistological finding in both cases was endometrial cancer. As we measured the serum estradiol levels 4 h after tablet ingestion supraphysiologic values ranging between 418 and 442 pg/ml were found.
Our report strengthens the evidence that supraphysiologic estradiol levels despite combination with cyclic progestagen therapy, increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
There is conflicting evidence of the effect of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on the development of allergic diseases in children. Studies have shown that this relationship differs depending on maternal history of the disease. We employed the rigour of propensity score methods to assess this relationship using data from a birth cohort.
Using n = 662 children from the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study, we assessed the relationship between early-life ETS and subsequent allergic sensitization via a positive skin prick test (SPT+) or at least one specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) ≥ 0.35 (sIgE+) in children aged 2-3 years. Propensity score estimation followed by full and nearest neighbour matching was compared with standard multivariable regression models.
Among children without a maternal history of allergic disease, ETS was positively associated with allergic sensitization in children with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for SPT+ of 2.32 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-4.22) and the aOR for sIgE+ was 2.53 (95% CI: 1.43-4.48). Contrarily, for children with a positive maternal history, the aOR for SPT+ and sIgE+ was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.24-1.32) and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.20-0.91), respectively.
Using propensity score methods to rigorously control for confounding factors, ETS exposure was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization in children with a positive maternal history. There is a strong association between early-life ETS and the development of allergic sensitization for children aged 2-3 years without maternal history.
The pathogenetic correlation between chronic alcohol consumption and development of esophageal cancer is not clear. The role of alcohol abuse in the carcinogenic action of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine, which induces tumors in the esophagus, has been evaluated.
Twenty male rats were fed liquid diets containing ethanol or carbohydrates for 30 weeks. N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (0.1 mg/kg, twice a week) was injected i.p. from the 9th to 19th week. The pair feeding was stopped at 9.00 am and N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine was administered at 10.00 am. Ethanol was not detected in the blood at the time of injection. Liquid diets were provided again at 3 pm until 9 am next day. The animals were killed at the end of the 30th week. The esophagi were collected and examined for visible tumors. The tissue sections were stained for histology and CYP2E1expression.
While 5-8 esophageal squamous polyps developed in all rats in the ethanol group, only one polyp each was formed in five out of the 10 rats in the control group. The size of the polyps was significantly larger in the ethanol group, when compared to the control group. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma was also observed in 50% of the animals in the ethanol group. Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) staining demonstrated marked expression in the esophageal mucosa in the ethanol group, but not in the control group.
The increased expression of CYP2E1 induced by chronic ethanol consumption promotes the development of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine-induced esophageal tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of the increased production of esophageal tumors during alternative administration of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine and ethanol is not clear.
The authors present an account on an uncommon case when damage of visual functions of a patient were due to two independent cause: amiodarone neuropathy of the optic nerve (ANO) and an intracranial tumour-a craniopharyngioma. Effective treatment of both diseases achieved marked improvement of visual functions. The authors want to draw attention to the fact that one disease which theoretically would be sufficient to explain impaired vision, is not necessarily the only disease from which the patient suffers. Comprehensive examination is always essential.
We conducted a phase I/II trial to assess the feasibility and activity of VIP-E chemotherapy in small-cell lung cancer. End-points were treatment-related morbidity and mortality, response to treatment. duration of response, and survival.
Two cycles of combination chemotherapy followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were given at a dose of etoposide (500 mg/m2), ifosfamide (4000 mg/m2), cisplatin (50 mg/m2), and epirubicin (50 mg/m2) to 100 consecutive patients with SCLC. Thirty patients (19 with LD, and 11 with ED SCLC) proceeded to VIC-E high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) at a cumulative dose of etoposide 1500 mg/m2, ifosfamide 12,000 mg/m2, carboplatin 750 mg/m2 and epirubicin 150 mg/m2 (VIC-E). Surgical resection of primary tumor was attempted at the earliest feasible point. Thoracic irradiation was given after completion of chemotherapy. RESULTS of conventional-dose VIP-E: 97 patients were evaluable for response. Objective response rate was 81% in LD-SCLC (33% CR, 48% PR; excluding patients in surgical CR) and 77% in ED-SCLC (18% CR, 58% PR). Treatment mortality was 2%. Median survival was 19 months in LD-SCLC and 6 months in ED-SCLC. Two-year survival was 36% in LD and 0% in ED SCLC. RESULTS OF HIGH-DOSE VIC-E: All 30 patients improved on or maintained prior responses. Four patients (13%) died of treatment-related complications. Median survival was 26 months in LD-SCLC and 8 months in ED-SCLC. Two-year survival was 53% in LD and 9% in ED SCLC.
VIP-E chemotherapy is an effective induction therapy for SCLC. Compared with traditional protocols such as ACO or carboplatin/etoposide, response rates are slightly improved, while survival is not different. In the LD SCLC subgroup, high-dose chemotherapy improved response rates and survival, especially for patients in surgical CR prior to high-dose therapy. In ED SCLC, however, higher response-rates did not translate into improved survival. Selected LD-SCLC patients with good partial or complete remissions after prior therapy may benefit from HDC and PBSCT.
Large-scale poisonings caused by methyl mercury (MeHg) have occurred in Japan (Minamata in the 1950s and Niigata in the 1960s) and Iraq (in the 1970s). The current WHO neurological risk standard for adult exposure (hair level: 50 μg/g) was based partly on evidence from Niigata which did not consider any cases who were diagnosed later and/or exposed to low level of MeHg (hair mercury level less than 50 μg/g).
Early in the Niigata epidemic in June 1965 there were two extensive surveys. From these two surveys, we examined 103 adults with hair mercury measurement who consulted two medical institutions. We compared the prevalence and the distribution of neurological signs related to MeHg poisoning between exposure categories.
We found 48 subjects with neurological signs related to MeHg poisoning who had hair mercury concentration less than 50 μg/g. Among the neurological signs, sensory disturbance of the bilateral distal extremities was observed more frequently, followed by disequilibrium, hearing impairment, and ataxia, in groups with hair MeHg concentration both below 50 μg/g and over 50 μg/g.
The present study suggests the possibility that exposure to MeHg at levels below the current WHO limits could cause neurologic signs, in particular, sensory disturbance.
A central dopaminergic origin has been demonstrated for the bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious, normotensive rats. The present study investigated the effect of bromocriptine on heart rate and the principal site of action of this agonist in conscious, deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats, in which altered central dopaminergic activity has been previously reported. Intravenous administration of bromocriptine (150 microg/kg) increased heart rate (49+/-5 beats/min.) in uninephrectomized control rats, while it induced a significant bradycardia (50+/-6 beats/min.) in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats. In the latter animals, intravenous (500 microg/kg) or intrathecal (40 microg/rat at T9-T10) pretreatment with domperidone, a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, reduced partially, but significantly, the bradycardiac responses to bromocriptine (reduction of about 44% and 48% of the maximal effect, respectively). In contrast, the bromocriptine-induced bradycardia was fully abolished by intravenous pretreatment with metoclopramide (300 microg/kg), a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier, or by combined pretreatment with intravenous and intrathecal domperidone. These results indicate that, in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats, bromocriptine decreases rather than increases heart rate, an effect that is mediated partly through a peripheral D2 dopaminergic mechanism and partly through stimulation of spinal dopamine D2 receptors. They further support the concept that, in normotensive, conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at both peripheral and spinal dopamine D2 receptors.
In a case of danazol-induced cholestasis, the anti-cholestatic agent S-adenosylmethionine was given intravenously for 3 weeks and then orally for 6 weeks. This was well tolerated and led to prompt resolution of both jaundice and associated renal impairment.
The urotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the protective effect of the herb berberine were investigated in this study. Administration of 150 mg/kg cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally caused a serious haemorrhagic cystitis in rats after 12 hr, including bladder oedema, haemorrhage, and dramatic elevation of nitric oxide metabolites (nitrite+nitrate) in urine and in plasma. To explore whether cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis could be prevented by berberine, rats were pretreated with a single dose or two doses of berberine at 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally then challenged with cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). The results indicated that pretreatment of rats with berberine could reduce cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that two doses of berberine showed greater protection against cyclophosphamide urotoxicity than when given a single dose. In addition, our data shows that a single dose of 200 mg/kg berberine, or two doses of 100, and 200 mg/kg berberine could completely block cyclophosphamide-induced bladder oedema and haemorrhage, as well as nitric oxide metabolites increase in rat urine and plasma. In conclusion, our findings suggest that berberine could be a potential effective drug in the treatment of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, and provides us with the bright hope in the prevention and treatment of cyclophosphamide urotoxicity.
The complex immunological effects of interferon and ribavirin therapy (IFN/R) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) may also exacerbate or trigger the de novo development of autoimmunity. We report the first case of IFN/R therapy associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, a T-cell-mediated autoimmune response to melanocytes. This condition, which has characteristic ocular, neurological and integumentary findings, elicits a systemic prodrome that may mimic side-effect profile and delay of IFN or mask its recognition. We discuss this disease in the context of the known immunomodulatory effects of IFN-alpha and ribavirin and suggest potential mechanistic explanations for the association.
Pallidotomy paradoxically reduces the intensity of levodopa-induced dyskinesia without worsening motor symptoms. The reasons for this are not clear and no experimental study has investigated this phenomenon. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on locomotor activity, motor disability and levodopa-induced dyskinesia in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated levodopa-primed common marmosets. Animals were primed to exhibit dyskinesia by daily administration of levodopa until stable dyskinesia was evoked by each dose. Locomotor activity, motor disability and dyskinesia were assessed weekly at baseline and following an acute levodopa challenge. Prior to pallidotomies, two distinct groups of animals emerged: poor responders to levodopa with mild dyskinesia (Group 1) and those exhibiting a marked increase in motor activity and pronounced dyskinesia (Group 2). Electrolytic lesions were placed in the left internal segment of the globus pallidus. Pallidotomy had no effect on basal or levodopa-induced motor activity in either group but significantly improved basal motor disability in Group 2. Following pallidotomy, the ability of levodopa to reduce motor disability was significantly increased in both groups. Pallidotomy improved dyskinesia in both Groups 1 and 2 but it was more effective in reducing dystonia compared with chorea. The effect of pallidotomy on dyskinesia in Group 2 was transient, with the intensity of involuntary movements reverting to presurgery levels 4 weeks later. This study shows that in levodopa-primed, parkinsonian marmosets, placement of discrete globus pallidus lesions can ameliorate levodopa-induced dyskinesia but not akinesia. This model allows the evaluation of pallidotomy-induced biochemical changes in dyskinetic primates.
An understanding of the neurochemical changes occurring following exposure to psychostimulants such as cocaine is critical for the development of novel pharmacotherapies aimed at disrupting the addictive cycle. It is well established that the acute effects of cocaine associated with drug-induced blockade of dopamine (DA) reuptake processes occur in reward-related areas of the brain including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Considerable evidence has accumulated indicating that the interaction between DA, glutamate, and nitric oxide (NO) is likely to play a critical role in the neuroplastic changes associated with psychostimulant exposure. However, the potential impact of cocaine on NO synthase (NOS) activity in the mPFC has not been examined. In this study, NO efflux was measured in the mPFC of anesthetized male rats using a NO-selective electrochemical microsensor. Acute systemic administration of cocaine significantly increased NO efflux in the mPFC in a time-dependent manner. Similar injections using vehicle did not affect NO efflux. The facilitatory effect of cocaine on NO efflux was transient and reproducible. The signal was derived from neuronal sources of NO, because it was attenuated by systemic administration of the neuronal NO synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole. These studies support a role for prefrontal cortical NO signaling in cocaine-induced changes in neurotransmission in reward-related circuits involved in addiction.
The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of the long-term paraquat administration on the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system in rats. Paraquat was injected at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. for 4-24 weeks. We found that this pesticide reduced the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons of the substantia nigra; after the 4-week treatment the reduction (17%, nonsignificant) was confined to the rostrocentral region of this structure but, after 24 weeks, had spread along its whole length and was approximately 37%. Moreover, it induced a biphasic effect on dopaminergic transmission. First, levels of dopamine, its metabolites and turnover were elevated (4-8 weeks) in the caudate-putamen, then all these parameters returned to control values (12 weeks) and dropped by 25-30% after 24 weeks. The binding of [3H]GBR 12,935 to dopamine transporter in the caudate-putamen was decreased after 4-8 weeks, then returned to control values after 12 weeks but was again decreased after 24 weeks. Twenty-four-week paraquat administration also decreased the level of tyrosine hydroxylase (Western blot) in the caudate-putamen. In addition, paraquat activated serotonin and noradrenaline transmission during the first 12 weeks of treatment but no decreases in levels of these neurotransmitters were observed after 24 weeks. The above results seem to suggest that long-term paraquat administration produces a slowly progressing degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons, leading to delayed deficits in dopaminergic transmission, which may resemble early, presymptomatic, stages of Parkinson's disease.
t has been suggested that long-medium chain triglyceride (LCT/MCT) emulsive propofol causes less injection pain than long chain triglyceride (LCT) emulsive propofol because of the decreased propofol concentration in the aqueous phase. Alternatively, LCT propofol generates bradykinin causing the injection pain and activates complement, but these effects when using LCT/MCT propofol have not been examined. To identify the mechanism for reduced pain with LCT/MCT propofol, injection pain, bradykinin generation and complement activation with use of both propofol products were compared.
Two hundred adult patients randomly allocated to two groups were given 1.5 mg x kg(-1) iv of either LCT propofol or LCT/MCT propofol at a rate of 200 mg x min(-1) in a double-blind manner and were asked to grade pain scores. In another study, bradykinin and activated complement 3 (C3a) concentrations were measured using blood obtained from 13 healthy volunteers mixed with saline, LCT propofol or LCT/MCT propofol.
There was a significant difference in pain scores between groups, showing a lower incidence of injection pain in the LCT/MCT propofol group. The bradykinin concentrations in blood mixed with LCT and LCT/MCT propofol were significantly higher than in blood mixed with saline. The C3a concentrations showed similar results.
LCT/MCT propofol causes less pain on injection compared with LCT propofol. Bradykinin generation and complement activation are similar with both LCT and LCT/MCT propofol. Thus, the reason for less pain on injection with LCT/MCT propofol may be attributed to a decreased concentration of propofol in the aqueous phase.
Between May 1985 and March 1992, 172 patients suffering from chronic erectile dysfunction (21-70 years old) underwent constant corpus cavernosum autoinjection therapy (CAT) with a standardized papaverine phentolamine mixture (16385 injections). Thereafter 41 patients continued CAT with the single agent papaverine (1257 injections). On the basis of both these 17642 protocol auto-injections, and over 6 years of experience with intracavernosal autoinjection therapy we conclude that, especially with the papaverine-phentolamine mixture, CAT constitutes an effective therapy (full rigidity in 95.8%) with tolerable side-effects for chronic erectile dysfunction when preceded by careful patient selection and thorough multi-disciplinary evaluation. This is especially so in the case of arterial and/or neurogenic aetiology of the erectile dysfunction. In addition, the contraindications must be strictly observed, the treatment and technique fully explained, and a regular follow-up instituted. CAT is generally well accepted by the patients and their partners (98.8%/97.6%) and has distinct positive effects on self-esteem (77.8%), performance anxiety (84.4%), and partnership (79.5%). The most serious side-effect was prolonged erection (25 out of 17642 injections). In 6 patients reversible fibrotic changes near the tunica albuginea were observed.
Atorvastatin and other members of the statin family are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in order to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Atorvastatin-induced adverse events are mostly mild and only a few cases of lupus-like syndrome or severe acute hepatitis have been documented. In this case report we describe a patient who developed an atorvastatin-induced severe autoimmune hepatitis. In addition, this patient presented with a concomitant systemic lupus-like syndrome which has been already described for statins but not in association with severe liver disease. Although the drug was immediately withdrawn the disease persisted and even deteriorated to a fulminant disease with evidence of acute hepatic failure. The patient failed to respond to conventional immunosuppression with corticosteroids and azathioprine. Only the introduction of intense immunosuppressive therapy, as used in solid organ transplantation, led to a complete and sustained recovery of the patient. Interestingly, the patient was HLA DR3- and HLA DR4-positive, which are well-known genetic factors associated with autoimmune diseases. This case is the first report of a drug-induced lupus-likesyndrome concomitant with a severe autoimmune hepatitis in a genetically predisposed patient.
The relationship between hypertension and cardiovascular damage was assessed in three groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR): 1. stroke prone SHR (SHR-SP) treated orally with an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) (100-400 mg/L in the drinking water) from 6 to 35 weeks of age, 2. SHR-SP maintained on tap water until 30 weeks of age, 3. stroke resistant SHR (SHR-SR) maintained on tap water. The controls were Wister Kyoto rats (WKY) maintained on tap water. Captopril-treated SHR-SP showed blood pressure lower than that of untreated SHR-SP, similar to SHR-SR. The ratio of heart weight to body weight was 0.55% in SHR-SP, 0.39% in captopril-treated SHR-SP, 0.46% in SHR-SR, and 0.39% in WKY. The kidneys of SHR-SP showed glomerular sclerosis, glomerular fibrosis, tubular casts, interstitial cell infiltration and vascular wall thickening or hyperplasia of the small arteries and arterioles. The severe glomerular sclerosis was mostly distributed in the inner and middle portions of cortex. Immunohistological study showed IgG, C3 and fibrinogen in the glomeruli and arterioles in SHR-SP. In captopril-treated SHR-SP, similar to SHR-SR, only minor histological changes were seen and there was no deposition of IgG, C3 or fibrinogen. No changes were seen in WKY. Thus, it was concluded that nephrosclerosis and cardiac hypertrophy in SHR-SP are prevented by captopril. The role of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems in organ pathogenesis in SHR-SP is discussed.
A 17-year-old woman was admitted because of proteinuria, microhematuria and liver dysfunction with increased antinuclear antibody and anti-myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO-ANCA). Fourteen months' previously, urinalysis and liver function showed normal range. At that time she suffered from tachycardia and weight reduction, diagnosed as Graves' disease, she was given propylthiouracil for treatment of her Graves' disease. The histological finding of renal biopsy was compatible with minor glomerular abnormalities. Liver biopsy finding was compatible with autoimmune hepatitis. After we had administered prednisolone, liver function returned to normal range and urine protein became negative. Then we performed subtotal thyroidectomy, and she was not given propylthiouracil. MPO-ANCA decreased gradually.
We report the case of an 85-year-old man with perfectly controlled hypertension and coronary insufficiency who presented with typical giant cell arteritis (GCA). Thirty-six hours after initiation of prednisolone therapy (1 mg/kg/d), acute coronary insufficiency with non-transmural infarction occurred. Outcome was favorable despite disturbances in heart rhythm. A review of the literature disclosed five cases of myocardial infarction related to GCA, confirmed upon pathological examination. Three out of five myocardial infarctions occurred between the third and seventh treatment days. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may be responsible for coronary complications which arise during the first days of GCA treatment. Furthermore, they justify close monitoring during the initial phase of treatment in patients with coronary diseases.
Drugs that act as allosteric activators at the benzodiazepine site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor complex are used commonly to treat insomnia but relatively little is known of how such use affects learning and memory. Although anterograde effects on memory acquisition have been shown, possible retrograde effects on consolidation are more relevant when such agents are administered at bedtime. We tested the effects of two GABA(A) allosteric activators on sleep-dependent motor skill memory consolidation in 12 healthy male subjects. Subjects slept in a sleep laboratory for four consecutive nights (one accommodation night followed by three experimental nights). Placebo, triazolam 0.375 mg, and zolpidem 10 mg were given to each subject in counterbalanced order on the experimental nights. Polysomnographic (PSG) sleep measurement and sleep-dependent motor learning were assessed at each condition. Triazolam was associated with longer total sleep time and increased Stage 2 sleep. Both zolpidem and triazolam were associated with increased latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Overnight motor learning correlated with total sleep time in the placebo condition but not in the triazolam or zolpidem conditions. A statistically significant impairment in motor performance occurred overnight in the triazolam condition only. Triazolam, given in sufficient doses to prolong sleep in healthy people, affected overnight motor learning adversely. Zolpidem, in a dose sufficient to prolong REM onset latency but without other effects on PSG-measured sleep, degraded the relationship between total sleep time and overnight motor learning. These data indicate that non-selective or alpha1-preferring benzodiazepine site allosteric activators can interfere with sleep-dependent memory consolidation.
Nicardipine has been shown to lower blood pressure in patients with uncomplicated hypertension as well as in patients with concomitant renal impairment, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. The decrease in blood pressure induced by nicardipine is related to a concurrent decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance. The antihypertensive actions of nicardipine are maintained during long-term administration without the development of tachyphylaxis. In patients receiving diuretics or beta blockers, the addition of nicardipine has been shown to produce an additional decrease in blood pressure. The combined use of nicardipine and beta blockers may be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension: the increase in peripheral vascular resistance during beta blockade may be prevented by nicardipine-induced vasodilation; conversely, beta blockers may prevent reflex tachycardia and other consequences of peripheral vasodilatation. Although nicardipine may increase the heart rate acutely, tachycardia does not occur during long-term therapy. Preliminary data suggest that nicardipine exerts potent antihypertensive effects in patients with renal insufficiency without altering renal parameters. In patients with normal renal function, nicardipine has been shown to cause acute natriuresis and an increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Nicardipine also has a favorable effect on peripheral and cerebral blood flow. Like other dihydropyridines, nicardipine appears to have an antiatherogenetic effect in the experimental model. Short-term therapy with nicardipine does not affect serum lipid levels. Results from several studies suggest that nicardipine is an effective antihypertensive agent that can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs such as beta blockers or diuretics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Used worldwide since 1980 for the prevention of breast engorgement in the puerperium, in 1994 bromocriptine mesylate was withdrawn from the American market as an agent suitable for ablactation. The relevant recommendation of the Food and Drug Administration rested on case reports that described severe vasospastic reactions among users of the drug. Some patients so affected suffered stroke, intracranial bleeding, cerebral edema, convulsions, myocardial infarction, and puerperal psychosis. More recently, it has been suggested that the side effects of the drug may also include circulatory collapse secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia. This report describes two additional cases in this category. The antepartum clinical evaluation of these women suggested that they were predisposed to arrhythmias.
