We examined the effect of alcohol ingestion on rat hepatocarcinogenesis induced by oral administration of synthetic female hormones, 0.075 mg of ethynylestradiol (EE) and 6.0 mg of norethindrone acetate (NA), everyday for 12 months to Wistar rats. Concomitant administration of 10% ethanol in drinking water resulted in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 40.8% in female rats and 11.8% in male rats at 12 months, although the incidences of HCC following hormones administration alone were 8.0% in female rats and 0% in male rats. The incidence and the number of hyperplastic nodules in rats with concomitant alcohol treatment were significantly higher than that in rats with hormone treatment alone. The additional alcohol administration significantly increased the values of nuclear and cytosol estrogen receptors at 4 months. Synthetic female hormones and/or alcohol treatment also significantly increased the value of cytosol progesterone receptor at 4 months. 32P-postlabeling analysis of liver DNA revealed that alcohol enhanced the DNA adduct formation induced by hormones. Consequently, alcohol may affect rat hepatocarcinogenesis caused by synthetic female hormones in enhancing cell-proliferating activity via estrogen and progesterone receptors, and DNA adduct formation induced by synthetic female hormones.
Mycobacterium kansasii was isolated from an area of cavitating pneumonia in a man with rheumatoid arthritis. Standard antituberculosis treatment, including isoniazid 300 mg daily, had to be stopped because of peripheral neuropathy. The patient, a slow acetylator, subjectively deteriorated despite withdrawal of isoniazid and treatment with pyridoxine 150 mg daily. Improvement occurred only after the pyridoxine had also been withdrawn. Pyridoxine may cause peripheral neuropathy and this case illustrates the need for caution in the use of this vitamin in the prevention and treatment of isoniazid induced peripheral neuropathy.
An international multicentre study of adverse reactions to D-penicillamine was undertaken on 2879 patients exposed to the drug--1491 of them a prospective sample. The majority of patients were being treated for rheumatoid arthritis. Over a period of 18 months, 319 (21%) of patients in the prospective sample developed adverse reactions necessitating drug withdrawal; two thirds of these occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. The most frequently-occurring adverse reactions involved skin (6%), kidneys (4%), gastro-intestinal tract (4%) and haemopoiesis (3%). Adverse effects, considered to be serious by the reporting physician, included fever and leucopenia during the early weeks of treatment and, after some months of drug exposure, proteinuria, myasthenia gravis, dyspnoea and pemphigus. Two patients died, one of fulminating septicaemia and the other was found at autopsy to have had multiple lung abscesses following unexplained anaemia and hemiparesis.
Emerging evidence indicates that PPARUpsilon activators attenuate neurodegeneration and related complications. Therefore, the present study focused on the neuroprotective potential of pioglitazone against quinolinic acid (QUIN) induced neurotoxicity. Intrastriatal (unilaterally) administration of QUIN significantly altered body weight and motor function (locomotor activity, rotarod and beam walk performance). Further, QUIN treatment significantly caused oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration and depleted endogenous antioxidant defense enzymes), altered mitochondrial enzyme complex (I, II and IV) activities and TNF-alpha level as compared to sham treated animals. Pioglitazone (10, 20 and 40mg/kg, p.o.) treatment significantly improved body weight and motor functions, oxidative defense. Further, pioglitazone treatment restored mitochondrial enzyme complex activity as well as TNF-alpha level as compared to QUIN treated group. While Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) (15mg/kg), PPARUpsilon antagonist significantly reversed the protective effect of the pioglitazone (40mg/kg) in the QUIN treated animals. Further, pioglitazone treatment significantly attenuated the striatal lesion volume in QUIN treated animals, suggesting a role for the PPARUpsilon pathway in QUIN induced neurotoxicity. Altogether, this evidence indicates that PPARUpsilon activation by pioglitazone attenuated QUIN induced neurotoxicity in animals and which could be an important therapeutic avenue to ameliorate Huntington like symptoms.
Overview and discussion regarding the use and relevance of lithium as an therapeutic agent for bipolar disorder in general, with a special focus on pregnancy, suicidality and possible side-effects.
Literature was handsearched and by searches of medline with special interest in recent results and comparative studies.
Lithium is still of high importance in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It is unmatched regarding decades of clinical experience and scientific evidence. It has a proven efficacy in every spectrum of bipolar illness, with less profound data regarding acute bipolar depression. Especially long term treatment of bipolar patients with lithium shows clear clinical benefits i.e.: importance of a continuous setting, gain of mood stabilizing effect over time, no loss of efficacy, reduced morbidity and mortality.
Lithium should be regarded as a first line treatment for bipolar disorder.
Acetaminophen (APAP) is the leading cause of drug induced liver failure in the United States. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is protective for APAP hepatic toxicity. SAMe is critical for glutathione synthesis and transmethylation of nucleic acids, proteins and phospholipids which would facilitate recovery from APAP toxicity. SAMe is synthesized in cells through the action of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). This study tested the hypothesis that total hepatic and subcellular SAMe levels are decreased by APAP toxicity. Studies further examined MAT expression and activity in response to APAP toxicity. Male C57BL/6 mice (16-22 g) were treated with vehicle (Veh; water 15 ml/kg ip injections), 250 mg/kg APAP (15 ml/kg, ip), SAMe (1.25 mmol/kg) or SAMe administered 1h after APAP injection (SAMe and SAMe+APAP). Hepatic tissue was collected 2, 4, and 6h after APAP administration. Levels of SAMe and its metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were determined by HPLC analysis. MAT expression was examined by Western blot. MAT activity was determined by fluorescence assay. Total liver SAMe levels were depressed at 4h by APAP overdose, but not at 2 or 6h. APAP depressed mitochondrial SAMe levels at 4 and 6h relative to the Veh group. In the nucleus, levels of SAMe were depressed below detectable limits 4h following APAP administration. SAMe administration following APAP (SAMe+APAP) prevented APAP associated decline in mitochondrial and nuclear SAMe levels. In conclusion, the maintenance of SAMe may provide benefit in preventing damage associated with APAP toxicity.
BAM-1120, an ergoline derivative, has been found to display a relatively high affinity for dopamine D2-like receptor subtypes in a preliminary binding study. This study investigated whether BAM-1120 acts as a dopamine receptor agonist on prolactin-secreting and motor functions. BAM-1120 suppressed hyperprolactinemia induced by pretreatment with reserpine or estradiol in female rats. Furthermore, BAM-1120 was able to shrink a prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) in the estradiol-treated female rats. BAM-1120 induced rotations contralateral to the lesion side in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of nigrostriatal dopamine pathway at a dose that was at least 30-fold higher than that required for the inhibition of prolactin secretion. These findings suggest that BAM-1120 is characterized as a putative dopamine D2-like receptor agonist that possesses a preference of inhibiting prolactin secretion over activating motor behaviors.
Until recently, actinomycin D (AMD), a cytotoxic antibiotic, was considered to cause little or no liver damage. There are now reports of liver failure following treatment of childhood cancers with AMD. This report describes the pathological changes in liver biopsy samples taken from 2 children who developed liver failure after combined chemotherapy for Wilms' tumor. The changes were those of nodular hyperplasia, sclerosis of terminal hepatic venules with associated zone 3 hemorrhagic necrosis, and sinusoidal fibrosis. These features were initially ascribed to the veno-occlusive disease caused by pyrrolizidine alkaloids, radiotherapy and some therapeutic drugs but have not been described in detail as a complication of AMD therapy. An additional feature peculiar to these 2 cases was the presence of unexplained extramedullary hematopoiesis.
Severe complications from the use of epidural morphine for analgesia after Caesarean section are rare. A case is reported of extreme prostrating vertigo several hours after epidural morphine injection, where the time of onset of the symptom coincided with the expected time of arrival of the morphine within intra-cerebral cerebro-spinal fluid.
Dyslipidaemia is very common in patients with HIV infection, but current therapies are often suboptimal. Since niacin may cause insulin resistance and hepatotoxicity, it has generally been avoided in this setting.
Non-diabetic male subjects (n=33) who had well-controlled HIV infection on antiretroviral therapy, fasting triglycerides > or =2.26 mmol/l and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) > or =4.66 mmol/l received escalating doses of extended-release niacin (ERN) up to 2,000 mg nightly for up to 44 weeks.
Fourteen subjects (42%) had pre-diabetes at entry. Twenty-three subjects (70%) received the maximum dose, eight (24%) received 1,500 mg. Niacin was well-tolerated. Only four subjects (12%) discontinued study treatment. There were small increases in fasting glycaemia and insulin resistance estimated by the homeostasis model assessment, but insulin resistance measures from the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test only transiently worsened. No subject developed persistent fasting hyperglycaemia; one had persistently elevated 2-h glucose >11.1 mmol/l. There were no significant changes in serum transaminases or uric acid. At week 48, the median change in fasting lipid levels in mmol/l (interquartile range) were: total cholesterol -0.21 (-1.35, -0.05), HDL-C +0.013 (-0.03,+0.28), non-HDL-C -0.49 (-1.37,+0.08) and triglycerides -1.73 (-3.68, -0.72). Favourable changes in large HDL and large very low density lipoprotein particle concentration were observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
ERN in doses up to 2,000 mg daily was safe, well-tolerated and efficacious in HIV-infected subjects with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Increases in glycaemia and insulin resistance tended to be transient.
The role of cyclosporine (CSA) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats. Administration of 20 mg/kg/day CSA for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man. The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential, such as gentamicin (at therapeutic doses), amphothericin B and ketoconazole, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model. Gentamicin at toxic doses, however, increased CSA nephrotoxicity. Thus, the nephrotoxicity induced by CSA has a different pathogenetic mechanism.
When captopril was injected intravenously in urethane anesthetized rats, a hypotensive effect accompanied by bradycardia was obtained, while an intravenous (i.v.) injection of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), which induced hypotension of the same magnitude as the hypotensive effect obtained with captopril, caused a marked tachycardia. Simultaneously, sympathetic nerve activity recorded from abdominal sympathetic nerves was unchanged following injection of captopril, while it was significantly increased during hypotension induced by PGI2. The bradycardia, but not the hypotensive effects induced by captopril was abolished by i.v. pretreatment with atropine. Intracisternal injection of a small dose of captopril inhibited reflex tachycardia during hypotension induced by PGI2 and prolonged the hypotensive effect, while intravenous administration of this dose did not inhibit the reflex tachycardia induced by PGI2. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the hypotensive effect of captopril was increased partly, however, the accompanying bradycardia was significantly reduced. These findings suggest that captopril inhibits the baroreflex and centrally activates the cardiac vagal nerve. Moreover in SHR, the effect of captopril on cardiac vagal activity was disturbed.
A progressive loss of neurons with age underlies a variety of debilitating neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), yet few effective treatments are currently available. The SIR2 gene promotes longevity in a variety of organisms and may underlie the health benefits of caloric restriction, a diet that delays aging and neurodegeneration in mammals. Here, we report that a human homologue of SIR2, SIRT1, is upregulated in mouse models for AD, ALS and in primary neurons challenged with neurotoxic insults. In cell-based models for AD/tauopathies and ALS, SIRT1 and resveratrol, a SIRT1-activating molecule, both promote neuronal survival. In the inducible p25 transgenic mouse, a model of AD and tauopathies, resveratrol reduced neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, prevented learning impairment, and decreased the acetylation of the known SIRT1 substrates PGC-1alpha and p53. Furthermore, injection of SIRT1 lentivirus in the hippocampus of p25 transgenic mice conferred significant protection against neurodegeneration. Thus, SIRT1 constitutes a unique molecular link between aging and human neurodegenerative disorders and provides a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention.
The neuroprotective effects of minocycline-which is broadly protective in neurologic-disease models featuring cell death and is being evaluated in clinical trials-were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. For the in vivo study, focal cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Minocycline at 90 mg/kg intraperitoneally administered 60 min before or 30 min after (but not 4 h after) the occlusion reduced infarction, brain swelling, and neurologic deficits at 24 h after the occlusion. For the in vitro studies, we used cortical-neuron cultures from rat fetuses in which neurotoxicity was induced by 24-h exposure to 500 microM glutamate. Furthermore, the effects of minocycline on oxidative stress [such as lipid peroxidation in mouse forebrain homogenates and free radical-scavenging activity against diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)] were evaluated to clarify the underlying mechanism. Minocycline significantly inhibited glutamate-induced cell death at 2 microM and lipid peroxidation and free radical scavenging at 0.2 and 2 microM, respectively. These findings indicate that minocycline has neuroprotective effects in vivo against permanent focal cerebral ischemia and in vitro against glutamate-induced cell death and that an inhibition of oxidative stress by minocycline may be partly responsible for these effects.
Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective anti-psoriatic agent but there are major concerns about its long-term toxicity, in particular to the liver. Reported frequencies and recommendations for monitoring patients on MTX vary considerably. The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and severity of MTX-associated adverse drug reactions (ADR) in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. A retrospective analysis was performed of 104 psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients (60 male, 44 female) treated with MTX between October 1968 and October 1998. The severity of ADR was classified according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). Acute ADR was defined as adverse effects within the first 90 days of MTX therapy. ADR seen later were classified as chronic. In 83 patients 165 ADR were noted within the beginning of MTX therapy. In five patients treatment was terminated because of ADR. During long-term therapy 23 patients received < or = 2000 mg MTX (group A); 81 received a cumulative dose greater than 2000 mg (group B). The total frequency of ADR in group B and the frequency of ADR CTC grade 3 or 4 in general was not significantly increased in group B (chi2 test; P = 0.468). Group B was characterised as follows: CTC grade 3 or 4 blood count changes led significantly more often to the termination of MTX (Fisher's exact test; P = 0.048), CNS side-effects (P = 0.016) and infections were more frequent (chi test; P<0.001). Liver changes and serum enzyme level increases were not significantly more frequent in group B. ADR are common in psoriasis patients on MTX therapy independent of the cumulative dose. In most cases they are temporary by nature and mild. Liver changes and serum enzyme level increases were not a major problem in our patients.
The cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs) mediate both acute and chronic inflammatory responses in mice, as demonstrated by the attenuation of the IgE/antigen-mediated increase in microvascular permeability and of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, respectively, in a strain with targeted disruption of leukotriene C(4) synthase to prevent cys-LT synthesis. Our earlier finding that the acute, but not the chronic, injury was attenuated in a strain with targeted disruption of the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 (CysLT(1)) receptor suggested that the chronic injury might be mediated through the CysLT(2) receptor. Thus, we generated CysLT(2) receptor-deficient mice by targeted gene disruption. These mice developed normally and were fertile. The increased vascular permeability associated with IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis was significantly reduced in CysLT(2) receptor-null mice as compared with wild-type mice, whereas plasma protein extravasation in response to zymosan A-induced peritoneal inflammation was not altered. Alveolar septal thickening after intratracheal injection of bleomycin, characterized by interstitial infiltration with macrophages and fibroblasts and the accumulation of collagen fibers, was significantly reduced in CysLT(2) receptor-null mice as compared with the wild-type mice. The amounts of cys-LTs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after bleomycin injection were similar in the CysLT(2) receptor-null mice and the wild-type mice. Thus, in response to a particular pathobiologic event the CysLT(2) receptor can mediate an increase in vascular permeability in some tissues or promote chronic pulmonary inflammation with fibrosis.
Undernutrition during critical periods of development may cause changes in the behavioural responses of rats to centrally acting drugs. In the present study, the effects of undernutrition during suckling on the behavioural responses of 21-days-old rats to chlorpromazine (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) or haloperidol (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg) were examined. Locomotion was assessed at 1 hr 30 min., 4 hr 30 min., 7 hr 30 min, and 10 hr 30 min., and catalepsy was scored at 3 hr, 6 hr and 9 hr after drug administration. Drug was injected on two consecutive days. On day 1, saline-treated undernourished rats showed significantly greater locomotion activity than did normal rats. The neuroleptic-induced inhibition of locomotor activity in undernourished rats was significantly less than that observed in normal rats from 4 hr 30 min. to 10 hr 30 min. (chlorpromazine) or from 7 hr 30 min. to 10 hr 30 min. (haloperidol). On day 2, a similar trend was observed but only in rats injected with 5 mg/kg chlorpromazine or 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg haloperidol. On day 1, the catalepsy scores at 3 hr revealed no significant difference between nutritional groups, but at 6 hr undernourished rats responded significantly less to chlorpromazine or haloperidol. On day 2, undernourished rats were less responsive to neuroleptics than normal rats, but the effect was not so evident as observed on day 1. The present results suggest that the behavioural effects of chlorpromazine and haloperidol are less persistent in undernourished rats, possibly due to differences in drug distribution and elimination, when compared to well-nourished rats.
Severe hemorrhagic cystitis associated with oral cyclophosphamide (CYP) therapy has rarely been reported in the past 20 years, probably because this condition has largely disappeared because of the use of shorter courses of CYP, either oral or IV. Herein, we describe a patient who received 309 g of oral CYP over a 4-year period to treat Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) that initially involved brain, lung, and kidney. She came under our care for the first time when she presented with a one-day history of oliguria and passing blood clots. Severe hemorrhagic cystitis was present. It eventually required cystectomy. Despite her massive CYP exposure her kidney biopsy showed acute crescentic glomerulonephritis. She survived her acute illness only to die 2 months later of acute leukemia. This patient is a reminder that severe hemorrhagic cystitis from oral CYP still exists, and that WG can be resistant to even toxic doses of oral CYP. Alternative therapies are discussed.
Palonosetron is the only 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that substance P (SP), the endogenous ligand acting preferentially on neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors, not serotonin (5-HT), is the dominant mediator of delayed emesis. However, palonosetron does not bind to the NK-1 receptor. Recent data have revealed cross-talk between the NK-1 and 5HT(3) receptor signaling pathways; we postulated that if palonosetron differentially inhibited NK-1/5-HT(3) cross-talk, it could help explain its efficacy profile in delayed emesis. Consequently, we evaluated the effect of palonosetron, granisetron, and ondansetron on SP-induced responses in vitro and in vivo. NG108-15 cells were preincubated with palonosetron, granisetron, or ondansetron; antagonists were removed and the effect on serotonin enhancement of SP-induced calcium release was measured. In the absence of antagonist, serotonin enhanced SP-induced calcium-ion release. After preincubation with palonosetron, but not ondansetron or granisetron, the serotonin enhancement of the SP response was inhibited. Rats were treated with cisplatin and either palonosetron, granisetron, or ondansetron. At various times after dosing, single neuronal recordings from nodose ganglia were collected after stimulation with SP; nodose ganglia neuronal responses to SP were enhanced when the animals were pretreated with cisplatin. Palonosetron, but not ondansetron or granisetron, dose-dependently inhibited the cisplatin-induced SP enhancement. The results are consistent with previous data showing that palonosetron exhibits distinct pharmacology versus the older 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists and provide a rationale for the efficacy observed with palonosetron in delayed CINV in the clinic.
A case of heparin-induced thrombosis of the brachial artery with thrombocytopenia is described. With discontinuation of the heparin, the circulating platelet volumes returned to normal. The role of pre-existing arterial disease and sepsis in patients exhibiting this phenomenon is unresolved.
A case of akinesia and mutism is described in a menopausal, depressed woman with onset following a mood challenge with 40 mg of methylphenidate taken orally over a 3-hour period. Various diagnoses are considered with preference given on clinical grounds to conversion disorder precipitated by drug-induced dysphoria. It is suggested that increased susceptibility to dysphoria may have been related to prior clomipramine administration and hypoestrogenism.
A series of dual inhibitors containing a 1,5-diarylpyrazole and a urea were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as novel COX-2/sEH dual inhibitors in vitro using recombinant enzyme assays and in vivo using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced model of pain in rats. The best inhibition potencies and selectivity for sEH and COX-2 over COX-1 were obtained with compounds (21b, 21i, and 21j) in which both the 1,5-diaryl-pyrazole group and the urea group are linked with a three-methylene group. Compound 21i showed the best pharmacokinetic profiles in both mice and rats (higher AUC and longer half-life). Following subcutaneous administration at 10 mg/kg, compound 21i exhibited antiallodynic activity that is more effective than the same dose of either a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) or a sEH inhibitor (t-AUCB) alone, as well as coadministration of both inhibitors. Thus, these novel dual inhibitors exhibited enhanced in vivo antiallodynic activity in a nociceptive behavioral assay.
Pulegone is the major constituent of pennyroyal oil, a folkloric abortifacient that is associated with hepatotoxicity and, in severe cases, death. Cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of pulegone generates menthofuran, which is further oxidized to form electrophilic reactive intermediates, menthofuran epoxide and the ring-opened γ-ketoenal, both of which can form adducts to hepatocellular proteins. Modification of hepatocellular proteins by the electrophilic reactive intermediates of menthofuran has been implicated in hepatotoxicity caused by pennyroyal oil. Herein, we describe the identification of several proteins that are the likely targets of menthofuran-derived reactive metabolites. These proteins were isolated from the livers of rats treated with a hepatotoxic dose of menthofuran by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-gel) separation and detected by Western blot analysis using an antiserum developed to detect protein adducts resulting from menthofuran bioactivation. The antibody-reacting proteins were excised from the 2D-gel and subjected to tryptic digestion for analysis of peptide fragments by LC-MS/MS. Although 10 spots were detected by Western blot analysis, only 4 were amenable to characterization by LC-MS/MS: serum albumin, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (MDH1), and mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit d. No direct adduct was detected, and, therefore, we complemented our analysis with enzyme activity determination. ALDH2 activity decreased by 88%, and ATP synthase complex V activity decreased by 34%, with no activity changes to MDH1. Although the relationship between these reactive metabolite adducted proteins and hepatotoxicity is not clear, these targeted enzymes are known to play critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
Myocardial infarction, a leading cause of death in the Western world, usually occurs when the fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery ruptures. The resulting exposure of blood to the atherosclerotic material then triggers thrombus formation, which occludes the artery. The importance of genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is best documented by the predictive value of a positive family history. Next-generation sequencing in families with several affected individuals has revolutionized mutation identification. Here we report the segregation of two private, heterozygous mutations in two functionally related genes, GUCY1A3 (p.Leu163Phefs*24) and CCT7 (p.Ser525Leu), in an extended myocardial infarction family. GUCY1A3 encodes the α1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (α1-sGC), and CCT7 encodes CCTη, a member of the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex, which, among other functions, stabilizes soluble guanylyl cyclase. After stimulation with nitric oxide, soluble guanylyl cyclase generates cGMP, which induces vasodilation and inhibits platelet activation. We demonstrate in vitro that mutations in both GUCY1A3 and CCT7 severely reduce α1-sGC as well as β1-sGC protein content, and impair soluble guanylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, platelets from digenic mutation carriers contained less soluble guanylyl cyclase protein and consequently displayed reduced nitric-oxide-induced cGMP formation. Mice deficient in α1-sGC protein displayed accelerated thrombus formation in the microcirculation after local trauma. Starting with a severely affected family, we have identified a link between impaired soluble-guanylyl-cyclase-dependent nitric oxide signalling and myocardial infarction risk, possibly through accelerated thrombus formation. Reversing this defect may provide a new therapeutic target for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction.
Dobutamine as a predominant beta-1 agonist increases heart rate and myocardial contractility and at sufficient high doses, it also increases systolic blood pressure. This study was undertaken to describe instances of paradoxical hypotension during dobutamine infusion for TI-201 myocardial perfusion SPECT study and the relationship between scintigraphic findings and hypotension occurred during dobutamine infusion.
In 201 consecutive patients unable to perform adequate exercise, dobutamine TI-201 myocardial SPECT was performed. Dobutamine was infused starting from 10 micrograms/kg/min increasing to 40 micrograms/kg/min. Paradoxical hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure > or = 20 mmHg compared with baseline study.
Paradoxical hypotension was observed in 40 patients (Group A) out of 201 (19.9%) while no significant change in systolic blood pressure was detected in the remaining 161 patients (Group B). Mean maximum fall in systolic blood pressure was 39 +/- 18 mmHg (range: 20-90). In 33 of 40 patients (83%) with paradoxical hypotension, scintigraphy was normal compared to 131 (81%) of the remaining 161 patients. In patients of Group A, angiography, echocardiography and tilt table tests were performed in 13, 11 and 6 patients respectively. Nine of 13 angiographic evaluations (69%), 10 of 11 echocardiographic evaluations (91%), all of the tilt table tests were normal. Additionally, all of the patients of Group A were clinically followed up at least 6 months after the myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. None of the patients had a cardiac event except one patient during the follow-up period.
Paradoxical hypotension during dobutamine infusion for myocardial scintigraphy is not an uncommon finding and up to 19.9% patients may develop such hypotension. To maximize test safety, precautions should be taken during dobutamine myocardial stress test, since remarkable decrease in systolic blood pressure may occur. Unlike hypotension occurring with exercise test, hypotension response to dobutamine is not always a marker for coronary artery disease.
