The effect of the clinically important anticonvulsant phenytoin (DPH) on hepatocarcinogenesis of male F344/NCr rats initiated with a single i.p. dose of N-nitrosodiethylamine (75 mg/kg b.w.) was studied. Beginning 2 weeks post-initiation, the rats received control diet or diet containing 500 or 1,500 ppm DPH or 500 ppm phenobarbital. At 52 weeks age, the incidences (and multiplicities, in units of tumors per tumor-bearing rat) of hepatocellular adenomas were 0%, 17% (1 +/- 0), 42% (1.8 +/- 0.8), or 67% (2.5 +/- 1.9) in rats exposed to N-nitrosodiethylamine alone, or the carcinogen followed by 500 ppm DPH, 1,500 ppm DPH, or 500 ppm phenobarbital, respectively. Between 53 and 79 weeks of age, 39% of rats receiving N-nitrosodiethylamine alone developed multiple (1.5 +/- 0.8) hepatocellular adenomas. A similar incidence (41%) occurred in the rats administered the carcinogen followed by 500 ppm DPH. The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas (88% and 89%) was significantly greater in rats exposed to N-nitrosodiethylamine followed by 1,500 ppm DPH or 500 ppm phenobarbital, respectively. Multiplicities of hepatocellular adenomas were significantly greater than the control value in rats fed 1,500 ppm DPH or 500 ppm phenobarbital (5.9 +/- 4.8 and 10.1 +/- 6.7, respectively), but not in the rats receiving 500 ppm DPH (2.3 +/- 1.6). No rats exposed to N-nitrosodiethylamine alone or the carcinogen followed by 500 ppm DPH developed hepatocellular carcinomas, while hepatocellular carcinomas occurred in 29% or 67% of the rats given 1,500 ppm DPH or 500 ppm phenobarbital, respectively, following initiation. Increases in hepatic CYP2B-mediated benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation activity in rats exposed to 500 and 1,500 ppm DPH for 2 or 23 weeks were approximately 50% and approximately 100%, respectively, of the maximal induction caused by 500 ppm phenobarbital. Thus, in the rat model, DPH enhanced N-nitrosodiethyl-amine-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis when administered at a dose causing maximal CYP2B induction.
Long-term intrathecal drug administration using implanted pumps is increasingly used in the treatment of chronic refractory pain [Anderson and Burchiel 1999, Neurosurgery 44 (1999) 289; Krames 2002, Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol 16 (2002) 619; Wallace 2002, Neurology 59 (2002) S18]. Extensive clinical experience over the last 15 years suggests that in selected cases the technique is safe, although infections, system malfunction and drug-related complications have been reported. In most cases, drug-related spinal cord injuries have resulted from the compression of a spinal inflammatory mass or abcess rather than from a direct neurotoxic effect. We report on a case of toxic spinal cord lesion occurring after more than 3 years of uneventful continuous infusion of a mixture of bupivacaine and clonidine.
Limbic seizures were evoked in rats by single subcutaneous injections of lithium and pilocarpine that are known to elicit severe damage to gustatory-affective centers in the brain. About two months later 12 of these rats and 12 control rats that received either lithium or pilocarpine (no seizures) were given free access to 10% sucrose solutions and then injected with 0.15 M LiCl (10 ml/kg). Whereas the control rats demonstrated the expected conditioned taste aversion (CTA) to later presentations of sucrose during single bottle drinking tests, the rats that had been seizured demonstrated a significant attenuation in CTA.
We have studied the effect of the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists on apomorphine-induced aggressive behaviour in male Wistar rats. In acute behavioural experiments with apomorphine-pretreated (1.0 mg/kg, s.c., once daily, 2 weeks) animals, risperidone (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) inhibited aggressive behaviour, but ketanserin and ritanserin (0.5-5. 0 mg/kg) had no effect on the latency and intensity of aggressive behaviour. Concomitant risperidone (0.5 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) administration blocked aggressive behaviour completely. In conclusion, our experiments confirm that inhibition of the apomorphine-induced aggressive behaviour is elicited by drugs with dopamine (DA) but not with 5-HT(2A) antagonistic activity. Moreover, it may be concluded that the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor subtype does not alter the DA-mediated behaviour.
There were five victims of neurotoxic food poisoning from a dried dressed fish fillet in Changhua County, Taiwan, in February 2000. The toxicity of the dried dressed fish fillets was 243 mouse units per g according to a tetrodotoxin bioassay. The partially purified toxin was identified as tetrodotoxin and anhydrotetrodotoxin. The sequence of the 376-nucleotide region in the cytochrome b gene of the mitochondrial DNA exhibited the same genotype as that of the toxic puffer fish Lagocephalus lunaris. The same single restriction site for Hinfl was found in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from the dried dressed fish fillet and the muscle of L. lunaris, yielding two DNA fragments of 170 and 206 bp. However, no restriction site for Hinfl was found in the PCR products from other toxic puffer fishes, including Takifugu niphobles, Takifugu oblongus, and Takifugu rubripes. Therefore, the species of the dried dressed fish fillet was identified as L. lunaris and its causative agent was identified as tetrodotoxin.
This study investigates whether vitamin B-6 supplementation reduces the stimulatory effects of theophylline (a pyridoxal kinase antagonist) on the nervous system. Twenty young, healthy adults entered this double-blind, randomized, crossover study but only 15 completed the experiment. The dependent measures were a battery of psychomotor tests, electrophysiological tests, and self-report questionnaires. Most tests, including spectral electroencephalography, aspects of the electromyograph, the Sternberg Test of information processing, and questionnaires of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness failed to distinguish between vitamin B-6 and placebo supplementation. However, theophylline-related tremor was markedly reduced (p < 0.01) with vitamin B-6 supplementation after a single dose of theophylline and a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed with repeated doses. There was a tendency for vitamin B-6 supplementation to reduce many side effects related to nervous system function. These findings suggest that vitamin B-6 supplementation with theophylline therapy may have some beneficial effects.
Several studies have suggested mitochondrial abnormality in bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ). We have previously reported the decreased expression of mitochondrial complex I subunit gene, NDUFV2 at 18p11, in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from Japanese patients with bipolar I disorder (BDI). Recently it was reported that no differences were found in NDUFV2 mRNA levels in LCLs of Caucasian BDI patients compared with controls. In this study, we tested the altered expression of NDUFV2 in extended Japanese LCLs and LCLs from different ethnic groups. Similar tendency was found in the current study compared with our previous study, since decreased expression of NDUFV2 in LCLs from Japanese patients with BDI was found (p=0.03). We also found that the expressions of NDUFV2 were up-regulated in those from patients with Japanese bipolar II disorder (p=0.001) and the mRNA levels of this gene were down-regulated in Caucasian SZ (p=0.000001) compared with controls. Furthermore, we revealed that the mRNA expression of NDUFV2 in LCLs cultured with valproate, one of mood stabilizers, were significantly increased compared with controls (p=0.02). Our study presented the further evidence of biological significance of NDUFV2 in BD and SZ.
Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), a type of brominated flame retardants (BFR), has become ubiquitous organic contaminants in recent years. However, studies on HBCD toxicity and the related molecular mechanisms are so far limited. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) on cytotoxicity induced by HBCD and the underlying molecular mechanisms. HepG2 cells were treated with HBCD and/or OPCs at different concentrations, and cell viability, cell apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cellular Ca(2+) level, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), cytochrome C (Cyt-c) release, and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) proteins expression were evaluated. Results showed that HBCD induced toxic effects in HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. HBCD at high concentrations (40 and 60μM) caused a significant decrease of cell viability and led to elevated cell apoptosis ratio, intracellular Ca(2+) level, cytoplasmic Cyt-c level, and ROS production, together with a loss of ΔΨ and mobilization of Nrf2. Pretreatment with OPCs effectively attenuated the cytotoxic effects and ROS production, as well as mitochondrial responses induced by HBCD. Thus, OPCs could alleviate cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells induced by HBCD through regulation on intracellular Ca(2+) level and ROS formation in a mitochondrial pathway.
Methimazole is a widely used antithyroid agent. Although methimazole is generally well tolerated, rare but severe cholestatic jaundice may occur. We described a 74-year-old woman who had a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes had developed severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole (10 mg tid) and propranolol (10 mg tid) for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Clinical investigations revealed no evidence of any mechanical obstruction in the common bile duct or other obvious causes of hepatic injury, and the diagnosis methimazole-induced cholestasis was made on the basis of the temporal relationship between initiation of methimazole and onset of cholestasis. Methimazole was hence discontinued. However, the patient experienced a progressive worsening in cholestasis after receiving 2 weeks of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy. Prednisone therapy was then attempted. Liver function tests eventually improved with combination of glucocorticoids and ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. This case clearly showed that glucocorticoids could be a possible additional way of treatment for some cases of drug-induced cholestatic jaundice even in diabetic patients.
To determine the effectiveness of artificial surfactant therapy using KL-4 surfactant in newborn pigs with hydrochloric acid (HCl)-induced acute lung injury (ALI).
After induction of ALI via intratracheal HCl instillation, pigs were randomized to receive 5.8 ml/kg KL-4 surfactant or no surfactant prior to extubation to bubble CPAP.
Clinical laboratory.
Spontaneously breathing newborn pigs (<1 week of age).
Treatment with KL-4 surfactant on bubble CPAP with PEEP of 6 cmH(2)O for 3.5 hr after extubation compared with controls.
Physiologic parameters and arterial blood gases were measured every 15 min. At the conclusion of the study, the lungs were excised for the analysis of histopathology and morphometric data.
Pigs treated with KL-4 surfactant had arterial blood gases with less acidosis (P < 0.001), higher P(a)O(2) levels (P < 0.001), and lower P(a)CO(2) levels (P < 0.001). Pigs treated with KL-4 surfactant had improved survival compared with controls (6/12 KL-4, 2/12 control, P < 0.05). Postmortem morphometric data demonstrated that pigs treated with KL-4 surfactant had larger (P < 0.05) exchange units in the caudal-dorsal lung as compared to relatively atelectatic region in the control animals.
In newborn pigs with severe HCl-induced ALI, treatment with KL-4 surfactant resulted in improved respiratory parameters, less dependent atelectasis, and improved short-term survival.
To study the effect of risperidone on prolactin levels in 3 adolescent patients.
This is a case study of 3 adolescent patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophreni-form disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, or chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia who were treated in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings with risperidone. Patients developed hyperprolactinemia with clinical symptoms. Risperidone was discontinued gradually over 2 weeks, and patients were treated with other atypical antipsychotics.
Prolactin levels returned to normal, and clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia resolved in all 3 patients after 2 weeks of tapering and discontinuation of risperidone.
Hyperprolactinemia can be a troublesome side effect with potentially serious complications. It is being increasingly reported in younger patients treated with risperidone. Recognition and treatment of this condition including switching to a prolactin-sparing agent are important to prevent this complication.
We report the case of an elderly woman who had been on hydroxyurea for long-standing widespread psoriasis. After approximately 5 years's treatment with hydroxyurea, she developed a symmetrical dermatomyositis-like eruption on her hands, together with bilateral leg ulceration. Although similar skin eruptions have been reported after long-term hydroxyurea treatment, all of the previous patients were being treated for myeloproliferative disorders. A dermatomyositis-like eruption has not previously been reported to occur as a consequence of hydroxyurea treatment for psoriasis. Its recognition is important to prevent unnecessary investigation or treatment withdrawal.
Genomic technologies have the potential to enhance and complement existing toxicology endpoints; however, assessment of these approaches requires a systematic evaluation including a robust experimental design with genomic endpoints anchored to traditional toxicology endpoints. The present study was conducted to assess the sensitivity of genomic responses when compared with the traditional local lymph node assay (LLNA) endpoint of lymph node cell proliferation and to evaluate the responses for their ability to provide insights into mode of action. Female BALB/c mice were treated with the sensitizer trimellitic anhydride (TMA), following the standard LLNA dosing regimen, at doses of 0.1, 1, or 10% and traditional tritiated thymidine ((3)HTdR) incorporation and gene expression responses were monitored in the auricular lymph nodes. Additional mice dosed with either vehicle or 10% TMA and sacrificed on day 4 or 10, were also included to examine temporal effects on gene expression. Analysis of (3)HTdR incorporation revealed TMA-induced stimulation indices of 2.8, 22.9, and 61.0 relative to vehicle with an EC(3) of 0.11%. Examination of the dose-response gene expression responses identified 9, 833, and 2122 differentially expressed genes relative to vehicle for the 0.1, 1, and 10% TMA dose groups, respectively. Calculation of EC(3) values for differentially expressed genes did not identify a response that was more sensitive than the (3)HTdR value, although a number of genes displayed comparable sensitivity. Examination of temporal responses revealed 1760, 1870, and 953 differentially expressed genes at the 4-, 6-, and 10-day time points respectively. Functional analysis revealed many responses displayed dose- and time-specific induction patterns within the functional categories of cellular proliferation and immune response, including numerous immunoglobin genes which were highly induced at the day 10 time point. Overall, these experiments have systematically illustrated the potential utility of genomic endpoints to enhance the LLNA and support further exploration of this approach through examination of a more diverse array of chemicals.
Antiestrogens used for breast cancer therapy can be categorized into two classes that differ in their effect on estrogen receptor (ER) alpha stability. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) stabilize ER alpha and the selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs) cause a decrease in cellular ER alpha levels. A clinically relevant antiestrogen, GW7604, appears to work through a SERD-like mechanism, despite sharing the same molecular scaffold as 4-hydroxytamoxifen, a SERM. In order to investigate potential structural features of GW7604 responsible for SERD activity, GW7604 and two analogs were synthesized using a new, improved synthetic route and tested for their effects on ER alpha function and cell proliferation. The two analogs, which have an acrylamide or a methyl vinyl ketone replacing the acrylic acid group of GW7604, display lower binding affinity for ER alpha than GW7604, but show similar antagonism of estradiol-induced activation of ER alpha-mediated transcription as GW7604 and inhibit estradiol-induced proliferation of the MCF-7 cell line with a similar potency as GW7604. Unlike GW7604, neither analog has a significant effect on cellular ER alpha levels, suggesting that the carboxylate is a key determinant in GW7604 action and, for the first time, showing that this group is responsible for inducing ER alpha degradation in breast cancer cells.
Strong evidence has recently been reported that major depression is accompanied by an acute phase response (APR), characterized by elevated levels of positive acute phase proteins (APPs) and decreased levels of negative APPs. The APR is also reflected in lowered total serum protein (TSP) and specific changes in the major electrophoretically separated protein fractions. The present study examined pretreatment and posttreatment serum TSP and the concentrations and percentages of the major electrophoretically separated serum protein fractions in 37 major depressed subjects, of whom 29 had treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and in 29 normal controls. We found that TSP and the percentage and concentration of serum albumin (Alb) and gamma-globulin fraction were significantly lower in major depression and TRD than in normal controls. Serum beta-globulin concentrations were significantly lower in major depressed and TRD subjects than in normal controls. The percentages of the alpha 1- and alpha 2-globulin fractions were significantly higher in major depressed subjects than in normal controls. There were no significant effects of subchronic treatment with antidepressants on TSP, the percentage or concentration of the major electrophoretically separated protein fractions, i.e. alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-globulin. There was a significant increase in percentage of the gamma-globulin fraction after subchronic treatment with antidepressants. The results support the hypothesis that major depression and TRD are accompanied by a chronic APR.
The first articles trying to link the effects of ethyl alcohol with those of opiates appeared in 1970. The first case of reversion from ethylic coma due to naloxone was described in 1978. Since then, many authors have reported different results related to the effectiveness of opiate antagonists in this clinical situation, without any of the studies showing a beneficial effect from its use. The purpose of the present study is to perform a double-blinded clinical trial with placebo to evaluate naloxone's clinical effectiveness in severe ethylic intoxication, using the Glasgow test (GT) to measure the level of consciousness. Treatment was randomly assigned to 38 patients of whom 18 received 2 mg of naloxone and 20 a placebo. Among the results, it was found that the best approximation of the level of alcoholemia responsible for ethylic coma, without the involvement of other toxic psychotropes, was made using the Glasgow test, especially in patients who are occasional drinkers. It was shown that naloxone indeed lacks effectiveness in ethylic coma, raising the level of consciousness only one or two points in the Glasgow test for the 15 to 45 minutes after its administration and primarily in the group of patients with the lowest levels of consciousness.
A 29-year-old otherwise symptom-free patient had undergone a partial thyroidectomy 5 years ago followed by an episode of ventricular tachycardia and (after lidocaine injection) ventricular fibrillation requiring external defibrillation. No cause for the arrhythmias had been found at that time. Two subsequent syncopes led to her hospitalization. An asystole occurred while she was being monitored, and during the resuscitation there were several periods of ventricular fibrillation, which responded to external defibrillation. Subsequently several episodes of self-limiting ventricular tachycardia were recorded. A long QT syndrome with torsade-de-pointes tachycardia was diagnosed on the basis of typical ECG changes (QT interval 545 ms). Extensive diagnostic tests failed to find a cause. To prevent further tachycardias she was given propranolol, 40 mg three times daily, and an automatic defibrillator was implanted as a precaution. But no defibrillator discharge has so far been required (more than 10 months).
A 56 year old postmenopausal patient underwent a right radical mastectomy for a stage I breast cancer. An adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen was planned, but, because of patient's choice, a regular administration of the endocrine treatment started only one year after the operation. After a very short period of drug administration, she developed a steroid responsive nephrotic syndrome. We have reviewed the international literature concerning drug-induced renal disease; this is the first case of a tamoxifen-induced nephrotic syndrome.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome is a rare but devastating complication. We report a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in whom heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome developed after a cardiac operation, complicated by acute thrombosis of the aorta followed by renal failure, paralysis, and ischemic necrosis of the lower extremities. The literature suggests aspirin, dipyridamole, and iloprost as effective prophylactic agents for perioperative heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome. This unfortunate complication underscores the importance of close platelet count monitoring in all preoperative patients undergoing prolonged heparin therapy.
