Myoclonic spasms occurred in a patient suffering from renal failure after high doses of continuous intravenous morphine (100 mg/h). The concentrations of morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide (mumol/l) in plasma were: 1.93, 52.06 and 381.8, and in cerebrospinal fluid were: 1.02, 5.86 and 61.82, respectively. The role of morphine and morphine glucuronides in myoclonic spasms is discussed.
There have been numerous evidences supporting the relationship between olive oil and cancer, with most of the attention being directed toward its fat and phenolic content. The aims of this study were to investigate whether EVOO and OA could enhance the effects of aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole) in ER-positive MCF-7 cells, as well as to investigate its influence on cytochrome c release and GSH levels. It was observed that upon combination treatment, anti-proliferation effects and apoptosis induction were augmented. Apoptosis was triggered via the intrinsic pathway in accordance with cytochrome c release into the cytosol based on IF-IC and ELISA observations. Intracellular GSH levels were also reduced upon EVOO/OA treatment in combination with aromatase inhibitors, and were found to be inversely correlated to cytosolic cytochrome c levels. Additionally, the estrogenic suppressive effects of letrozole and anastrozole were amplified when used in combination with EVOO/OA. Therefore, the employment of aromatase inhibitors in combination with EVOO/OA could orchestrate a reduction in intracellular estrone biosynthesis which feeds ER-positive cells, while simultaneously depleting GSH levels and increasing ROS generation, thus releasing cytochrome c and subsequent induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.
A 56 year old woman was admitted to our hospital with crescendo chest pain in the last ten days. Her past history included hypertension treated by 100 mg metoprolol for more than ten years and right carotid endarterectomy. She complained headache and a treatment of 20 mg nicergoline (ergoline derivate) daily was started. Her chest pains started always one hour after the nicergoline intake. The chest pain was accompanied by breathing difficulties and sweating of 5 min duration at first but the next days it lasted longer and longer. Next morning following her admission, one hour after the nicergoline administration she had severe chest pain again. The ECG showed ST-segment elevation in inferior leads resolved after nitroglycerin administration. The angiogram revealed normal coronary artery. Nicergoline was stopped. The patient was treated with felodipine and remains free of symptoms. Nicergoline was good for head but worse for heart in this case.
5,6,7-Trimethoxyflavone (TMF), methylations of the hydroxyl groups of oroxylin A or baicalein, was found to significantly inhibit the productions of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, no report has been issued on the anti-inflammatory potential of TMF and the underlying molecular mechanism. In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of TMF in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and LPS-induced septic shock in mice. TMF dose-dependently inhibits iNOS and COX-2 at the protein, mRNA, and promoter binding levels and that these inhibitions cause attendant decreases in the productions of NO and PGE2. TMF inhibits the productions and mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 induced by LPS. Furthermore, TMF suppress the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), and nuclear translocations of NF-κB, AP-1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). Pretreatment with TMF increase the survival rate of mice with LPS-induced endotoxemia and reduced the serum levels of cytokines. Taken together, these findings suggest that TMF down-regulates the expressions of the pro-inflammatory iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 genes in macrophages by interfering with the activation of NF-κB, AP-1, and STAT1/3.
Toxic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) water blooms have become a serious problem in several industrialized areas of the world. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a cyanobacterial heptapeptide that represents acute and chronic hazards to animal and human health. Identification of suitable chemprotectants against microcystin is essential considering human health hazards. In the present study, we have evaluated the protective efficacy of three flavanoids namely quercetin (200 mg/kg), silybin (400 mg/kg), and morin (400 mg/kg)] pretreatment against microcystin toxicity (0.75 LD(50), 57.5 microg/kg) in mice. Various biochemical variables were measured to study the recovery profile of protected animals at 1- and 3-days post-toxin treatment. The serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) shows 17-fold increase in MC-LR treated animals compared with control group at 1 day. The silybin and quercetin group showed a decrease in level of ALT compared with MC-LR group but still higher than control group. No significant protection was observed with aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in flavanoid-treated groups at 1-day post-treatment. But at 3 days, the serum levels of AST and ALT were normalized to control values, but the serum LDH levels were still significantly higher than the control group. No significant changes were observed in glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione levels at both 1- and 3-day postexposure. The catalase activity shows a significant decrease in quercetin-treated animals at 3-day postexposure. The protein phosphatase was significantly inhibited in MC-LR group compared to control. The silybin pretreated group showed recovery after 1 day. At 3 days, the PPAse activity was reversed to control values in all the flavanoid-treated groups. Immunoblotting analysis showed microcystin-PPAse adduct in liver tissues of toxin-treated as well as flavanoid-treated mice even after 3 days. The results of this study show that flavanoids, quercetin, silybin, and morin could reverse the hepatotoxic effects of MC-LR in vivo.
Formaldehyde was administered for 104 weeks in drinking water supplied ad libitum at concentrations of 1500, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, or 0 mg/L to groups of 50 male and 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats beginning at seven weeks of age. Control animals (100 males and 100 females) received tap water only. Acetaldehyde was administered to 50 male and 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats beginning at six weeks of age at concentrations of 2,500, 1,500, 500, 250, 50, or 0 mg/L. Animals were kept under observation until spontaneous death. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were found to produce an increase in total malignant tumors in the treated groups and showed specific carcinogenic effects on various organs and tissues.
4-tert-octylphenol (OP) is known to disrupt testicular development and reduce male fertility. In the present study, male mice were exposed to OP at two different developmental stages, and the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and testosterone production were evaluated. Juvenile (15-day-old) and adult (8-week-old) male mice were injected with 2, 20, or 200 mg/kg of OP or 0.2 microg/kg of estradiol valerate for 5 days. Testosterone concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay and the expressions of the testicular genes were determined by RT-PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry. In the animals exposed with 20 mg/kg of OP during juvenile stage, histochemical analysis of the testis showed that number of pyknotic germ cells inside the tubule was increased, while the number of oil red O positive Leydig cells was decreased. Moreover, the lumen formation was remarkably delayed. A reduced serum testosterone concentration and down-regulated expressions of the mRNAs for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), and 17alpha-hydroxylase/C(17-20) lyase (P450(17alpha)) were also observed after juvenile exposure to OP. Immunohistochemical staining for P450scc was mainly detected in interstitial Leydig cells, and a slightly reduced expression of P450scc protein was observed in the testis exposed to 20 mg/kg of OP during juvenile stage. The present study demonstrates that juvenile exposure to OP inhibits steroidogenesis by decreasing the expressions of steroidogenic enzymes in the testis. Diminished lipid content in Leydig cells and reduced transcriptional expression of the cholesterol transport gene, StAR, also support altered cholesterol metabolism and/or transport as a potential mechanism for the decreased testosterone production following exposure to OP. Altogether, the alteration of steroidogenesis by exposure to OP may adversely affect the normal development of the testis and spermatogenesis.
Mancozeb, an ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate (EBDC), has been one of the most commonly used fungicides in commercial use for several decades. Nevertheless, up to now, no adequate published experimental studies on the carcinogenicity of Mancozeb have been published. Because of the importance of the compound and of the number of people potentially exposed (workers engaged in the production and use of the fungicide, people living in agricultural areas where the compound is sprayed, and people consuming polluted products), a long-term experimental study of Mancozeb was begun at the Cancer Research Center of the Ramazzini Foundation. Groups of 150 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, 8 weeks old at the start of the treatment, were administered Mancozeb at the concentration of 1000, 500, 100, 10, and 0 ppm in feed supplied ad libitum for 104 weeks. At the end of the treatment, animals were kept under controlled conditions until spontaneous death. Mancozeb caused an increase in (1) total malignant tumors, (2) malignant mammary tumors, (3) Zymbal gland and ear duct carcinomas, (4) hepatocarcinomas, (5) malignant tumors of the pancreas, (6) malignant tumors of the thyroid gland, (7) osteosarcomas of the bones of the head, and (8) hemolymphoreticular neoplasias. On the basis of these data, Mancozeb must be considered a multipotent carcinogenic agent.
We studied a patient with no prior history of neuromuscular disease who became virtually quadriplegic after parenteral magnesium administration for preeclampsia. The serum magnesium concentration was 3.0 mEq/L, which is usually well tolerated. The magnesium was stopped and she recovered over a few days. While she was weak, 2-Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise, suggesting postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade. After her strength returned, repetitive stimulation was normal, but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking. Her acetylcholine receptor antibody level was markedly elevated. Although paralysis after magnesium administration has been described in patients with known myasthenia gravis, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease. Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of magnesium should be suspected of having an underlying disorder of neuromuscular transmission.
Many epoxides and their precursors are high production volume chemicals that have major uses in the polymer industry and as intermediates in the manufacture of other chemicals. Several of these chemicals were demonstrated to be carcinogenic in laboratory animal studies conducted by the Ramazzini Foundation (e.g., vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, styrene, styrene oxide, and benzene) and by the National Toxicology Program (e.g., ethylene oxide, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, acrylonitrile, glycidol, and benzene). The most common sites of tumor induction were lung, liver, harderian gland, and circulatory system in mice; Zymbal's gland and brain in rats; and mammary gland and forestomach in both species. Differences in cancer outcome among studies of epoxide chemicals may be related to differences in study design (e.g., dose, duration, and route of exposure; observation period; animal strains), as well as biological factors affecting target organ dosimetry of the DNA-reactive epoxide (toxicokinetics) and tissue response (toxicodynamics). N7-Alkylguanine, N1-alkyladenine, and cyclic etheno adducts, as well as K-ras and p53 mutations, have been detected in animals and/or workers exposed to several of these chemicals. The classifications of these chemical carcinogens by IARC and NTP are based on animal and human data and results of mechanistic studies. Reducing occupational and environmental exposures to these chemicals will certainly reduce human cancer risks.
The membrane protein Nogo-A, which is predominantly expressed by oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS and by neurons mainly during development, is well known for limiting neurite outgrowth and regeneration in the injured mammalian CNS. In addition, it has recently been proposed that abnormal Nogo-A expression or Nogo receptor (NgR) mutations may confer genetic risks for neuropsychiatric disorders of presumed neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia. We therefore evaluated whether Nogo-A deletion may lead to schizophrenia-like abnormalities in a mouse model of genetic Nogo-A deficiency. Here, we show that systemic, lifelong knock-out of the Nogo-A gene can lead to specific behavioral abnormalities resembling schizophrenia-related endophenotypes: deficient sensorimotor gating, disrupted latent inhibition, perseverative behavior, and increased sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effects of amphetamine. These behavioral phenotypes were accompanied by altered monoaminergic transmitter levels in specific striatal and limbic structures, as well as changes in dopamine D2 receptor expression in the same brain regions. Nogo-A deletion was further associated with elevated expression of growth-related markers. In contrast, acute antibody-mediated Nogo-A neutralization in adult wild-type mice failed to produce such phenotypes, suggesting that the phenotypes observed in the knock-out mice might be of developmental origin, and that Nogo-A normally subserves critical functions in neurodevelopment. This study provides the first experimental demonstration that Nogo-A bears neuropsychiatric relevance, and alterations in its expression may be one etiological factor in schizophrenia and related disorders.
Saw palmetto is the most popular herbal supplement used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The safety and efficacy of saw palmetto has been established in the literature. While the majority of studies document the efficacy and safety of saw palmetto, some studies document the adverse side effects, including increased risk of bleeding. There are no reports in the literature about increased prothombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or international normalized ratio (INR) while using saw palmetto. We present a case of hematuria and coagulopathy in a patient who was using saw palmetto.
Chronic alcohol drinking has been associated with the development of a number of abnormalities, including neuron-behavioral disorders, liver, pancreas, and heart-related diseases and inflammation and immune disorders. Because diverse mechanisms are involved in the development of these disorders, the commonly used receptor- or enzyme-specific drugs do not provide comprehensive protection against the adverse effects of alcoholism. This study describes possible therapeutic potency of puerarin (PU) from kudzu root, polyenylphosphatidylcholine from soy (SPCh), and curcumin (CU) from turmeric against alcohol's addiction-related and inflammatory-related abnormalities in alcohol-preferring P rats receiving free choice water and 15% ethanol in water. P-rats were fed once daily either the vehicle (for control) or different doses of PU, SPCh, CU, PU + SPCh, or PU + CU. The rats were divided in two groups: one received water alone, and the other free choice water and ethanol. Four rats from each group were fitted with electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes for EEG recording. After 70 days of alcohol drinking, alcohol was withdrawn for 2 weeks, and the withdrawal symptoms were assessed. This study showed that alcohol drinking for 70 days (1) caused liver inflammation characterized by elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression and (2) dysregulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pleurisy. Alcohol withdrawal after 70 days of drinking generated severe withdrawal symptoms including seizure-type EEG activity. PU suppressed the addiction-mediated abnormalities but did not affect the inflammation-related abnormalities, while SPCh or CU suppressed only the inflammation-related abnormalities in alcohol-drinking rats subjected to LPS-induced pleurisy. A combination of PU with SPCh or CU suppressed both the addiction-related and inflammation-related abnormalities of alcohol drinking. Therefore, a mixture consisting of PU and either SPCh or CU may provide alternative therapy for alcohol-related disorders.
In this long-term, double-blind, multicenter study, efficacy and safety of zomepirac sodium were compared with those of aspirin for treatment of the chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis in 607 patients, 405 of whom received zomepirac and 202 of whom received aspirin. Final evaluations during one year of treatment showed zomepirac significantly more effective than aspirin for reducing pain at rest (P = 0.02) and average pain (P = 0.04). Moreover, zomepirac was rated better than aspirin in physician global evaluations of overall response to therapy (P = 0.02) and patient evaluations of pain relief (P = 0.03). At the end of the one-year study, patients were permitted to extend double-blind treatment for an additional year. In final evaluations for patients who continued, zomepirac was significantly better than aspirin for relief of pain on motion (P = 0.05) and also in patient global evaluations of therapeutic response (P = 0.02). Side effect profiles during the first year of therapy were generally comparable for zomepirac and aspirin. However, complaints related to the special senses, especially tinnitus and hearing disturbances, were reported more frequently during aspirin therapy, and urogenital side effects were more common during zomepirac therapy. For both drug groups, the overall incidence of side effects was lower in the second year than in the first. This is the first published study to show a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent to be more effective than aspirin for the long-term treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis.
The purpose of this study was to study the underlying molecular mechanisms of the protective cardiac effects of physical exercise.
Telomere-regulating proteins affect cellular senescence, survival, and regeneration.
C57/Bl6 wild-type, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-deficient and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-deficient mice were randomized to voluntary running or no running wheel conditions (n = 8 to 12 per group).
Short-term running (21 days) up-regulated cardiac telomerase activity to >2-fold of sedentary controls, increased protein expression of TERT and telomere repeat binding factor (TRF) 2, and reduced expression of the proapoptotic mediators cell-cycle-checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), p53, and p16. Myocardial and leukocyte telomere length did not differ between 3-week- and 6-month-old sedentary or running mice, but telomerase activity, TRF2 and TERT expression were persistently increased after 6 months and the expression of Chk2, p53, and p16 remained down-regulated. The exercise-induced changes were absent in both TERT(-/-) and eNOS(-/-) mice. Running increased cardiac expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. Treatment with IGF-1 up-regulated myocardial telomerase activity >14-fold and increased the expression of phosphorylated Akt protein kinase and phosphorylated eNOS. To test the physiologic relevance of these exercise-mediated prosurvival pathways, apoptotic cardiomyopathy was induced by treatment with doxorubicin. Up-regulation of telomere-stabilizing proteins by physical exercise in mice reduced doxorubicin-induced p53 expression and potently prevented cardiomyocyte apoptosis in wild-type, but not in TERT(-/-) mice.
Long- and short-term voluntary physical exercise up-regulates cardiac telomere-stabilizing proteins and thereby induces antisenescent and protective effects, for example, to prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. These beneficial cardiac effects are mediated by TERT, eNOS, and IGF-1.
To investigate the anti-fibrotic effects of Qishen Yiqi Dropping Pills (QYDP) in rats with liver fibrosis (LF).
The LF model was induced by intraperitoneal injection with dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). Sixty Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal group, the model group A, the QYDP intervened group , the model group B , and the QYDP treated group B. The degree of LF was evaluated according to 6-phase grading method. The expressions of collagen type I and III and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in liver tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry and the levels of collagen type I and III and TIMP-1 mRNA determined by semi-quantitive RT-PCR.
Compared with the model group A and B, the degree of LF, the positive expressions of TIMP-1 mRNA and the content of collagen type I and III in liver tissue in the QYDP intervened and treated groups were significantly lower.
QYDP could reduce the pathological changes and degree of LF in rats, which may be partially through inhibiting the expressions of collagen type I and III and TIMP-1.
Guanfacine extended release (GXR) is a selective alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor agonist that is shown to be an effective nonstimulant treatment for the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This report documents the time course and predictors of symptom efficacy and sedation-related adverse events (AEs) that emerge during GXR treatment throughout 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of the drug.
Analysis of data from 3 GXR clinical trials.
Few variables related to the study participants or their treatment regimen affects the emergence or magnitude of sedation-related AEs. The best predictor of sedation is treatment duration, with the likelihood of sedation-related AEs decreasing with increasing time on medication. Sedation-related AEs are not predicted by the actual dose a participant receives, the magnitude of any dose changes, or the relationship between dose received and the magnitude of dose changes. Rates of discontinuation because of sedation-related side effects average 6.3% for GXR-treated participants and 0.5% for placebo-treated participants across the three trials.
These results suggest that acclimation to GXR may minimize the risk for, and magnitude of, sedation-related AEs. (J. of Att. Dis. 2010; 13(5) 532-538).
We report endometrial adenocarcinoma in two patients shortly after suspending GnRH-agonist treatment for menometrorrhagia and uterine fibromata.
To investigate the predictive value of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and class IIIβ-tubulin protein expression in tumor tissue for the efficacy of taxol and cisplatin combined chemotherapy (TP) in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
A total of 92 stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients were recruited with 87 patients evaluated. Bronchoscopy or lung puncture tumor biopsy samples were obtained with BRCA1 and class IIIβ-tubulin protein expression examined immunohistochemically before chemotherapy. The patients were randomly assigned to be received 4 to 6 cycles of TP chemotherapy regiments and followed up until death or lost. Response rate (RR), overall survival (OS) and time to tumor progression (TTP) were assessed.
Among the 87 evaluated patients, the positive expression rates of BRCA1 and class IIIβ-tubulin were 57.5% (50/87) and 48.3% (42/87) respectively. There was no significant difference in clinical characteristics among patients with different positive expression rate. According to different expression of BRCA1 and class IIIβ-tubulin, the patients were divided into four groups: group A (low expression of both BRCA1 and class IIIβ-tubulin), group B (high expression of both BRCA1 and class IIIβ-tubulin), group C (high expression of only BRCA1) and group D (high expression of only class IIIβ-tubulin). The RR was higher in group A than other three groups (60.7%, 34.8%, 9/19 and 6/17 respectively). The OS and TTP were longer in group A than other three groups [OS: (539.4 ± 17.6) days, (267.2 ± 20.5) days, (325.6 ± 24.1) days and (283.7 ± 26.2) days respectively; TTP: (256.9 ± 28.4) days, (143.8 ± 17.6) days, (179.3 ± 19.8) days and (152.6 ± 23.5) days respectively]. There were no significant differences among the other three groups.
The expression level of BRCA1 and class IIIβ-tubulin in tumor tissue is probably a predictor for the efficacy of TP chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. TP chemotherapy is more suitable for the NSCLC patients with lower expression of both BRCA1 and class IIIβ-tubulin. Our study may provide a new sight for tailored chemotherapy in NSCLC patients.
Despite rapid advances in the identification of genes involved in disease, the predictive power of the genotype remains limited, in part owing to poorly understood effects of second-site modifiers. Here we demonstrate that a polymorphic coding variant of RPGRIP1L (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein-1 like), a ciliary gene mutated in Meckel-Gruber (MKS) and Joubert (JBTS) syndromes, is associated with the development of retinal degeneration in individuals with ciliopathies caused by mutations in other genes. As part of our resequencing efforts of the ciliary proteome, we identified several putative loss-of-function RPGRIP1L mutations, including one common variant, A229T. Multiple genetic lines of evidence showed this allele to be associated with photoreceptor loss in ciliopathies. Moreover, we show that RPGRIP1L interacts biochemically with RPGR, loss of which causes retinal degeneration, and that the Thr229-encoded protein significantly compromises this interaction. Our data represent an example of modification of a discrete phenotype of syndromic disease and highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach for the discovery of modifier alleles of intermediate frequency and effect.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a heritable component and is an important global public health problem because of its high prevalence and morbidity. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify susceptibility loci for glomerular filtration rate, estimated by serum creatinine (eGFRcrea) and cystatin C (eGFRcys), and CKD (eGFRcrea < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) in European-ancestry participants of four population-based cohorts (ARIC, CHS, FHS, RS; n = 19,877; 2,388 CKD cases), and tested for replication in 21,466 participants (1,932 CKD cases). We identified significant SNP associations (P < 5 × 10(-8)) with CKD at the UMOD locus, with eGFRcrea at UMOD, SHROOM3 and GATM-SPATA5L1, and with eGFRcys at CST and STC1. UMOD encodes the most common protein in human urine, Tamm-Horsfall protein, and rare mutations in UMOD cause mendelian forms of kidney disease. Our findings provide new insights into CKD pathogenesis and underscore the importance of common genetic variants influencing renal function and disease.
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, caused by mutations in the PKD1 gene, is characterized by progressive deterioration of kidney function due to the formation of thousands of cysts leading to kidney failure in mid-life or later. How cysts develop and grow is currently unknown, although extensive research revealed a plethora of cellular changes in cyst lining cells. We have constructed a tamoxifen-inducible, kidney epithelium-specific Pkd1-deletion mouse model. Upon administration of tamoxifen to these mice, a genomic fragment containing exons 2-11 of the Pkd1-gene is specifically deleted in the kidneys and cysts are formed. Interestingly, the timing of Pkd1-deletion has strong effects on the phenotype. At 1 month upon gene disruption, adult mice develop only a very mild cystic phenotype showing some small cysts and dilated tubules. Young mice, however, show massive cyst formation. In these mice, at the moment of gene disruption, cell proliferation takes place to elongate the nephron. Our data indicate that Pkd1 gene deficiency does not initiate sufficient autonomous cell proliferation leading to cyst formation and that additional stimuli are required. Furthermore, we show that one germ-line mutation of Pkd1 is already associated with increased proliferation.
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. We report the findings of a genome-wide association study of T1D, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. Forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with T1D in the meta-analysis (P < 10(-6)). After excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Of these, 18 regions were replicated (P < 0.01; overall P < 5 × 10(-8)) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (P < 0.05). The many new candidate genes suggested by these results include IL10, IL19, IL20, GLIS3, CD69 and IL27.
In a clinical trial of two antirheumatic agents two methods of collection of side effects were used, one with and the other without a check list of possible symptoms. Findings suggested that the use of a check list interfered with the collection of side effects. Known side effects of aspirin-tinnitus, deafness, and gastrointestinal disturbance-were more efficiently shown and symptoms not included in the check list were more likely to be reported when a check list was not used.
