The efficacy of felodipine and tolerance of this drug was examined in 52 patients, 23 men and 29 women, 18-76 years of age, in whom it either replaced previous therapies of nifedipine and other vasodilators, or was added to a constant dose of beta blockers and diuretics or another previous therapy, which was unchanged. Felodipine significantly reduced blood pressure (BP), from 192.3 +/- 31.9/114.3 +/- 18.0 to 155.7 +/- 19.5/93.8 +/- 11.5 mm Hg, with no change in pulse rate. There were no significant biochemical changes, renal deterioration or blood sugar disequilibrium. Adverse reactions including flushes and leg edema could be tolerated by most of the patients, however six patients dropped out. Orthostasis dictated a decrease in felodipine dosage. Felodipine appears to be a highly potent, well tolerated drug and offers a substitute treatment for severe hypertensives refractory to other vasodilators.
Lynch syndrome patients are susceptible to colorectal and endometrial cancers owing to inactivating germline mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MSH2 (ref. 1). Here we describe patients from Dutch and Chinese families with MSH2-deficient tumors carrying heterozygous germline deletions of the last exons of TACSTD1, a gene directly upstream of MSH2 encoding Ep-CAM. Due to these deletions, transcription of TACSTD1 extends into MSH2. The MSH2 promoter in cis with the deletion is methylated in Ep-CAM positive but not in Ep-CAM negative normal tissues, thus revealing a correlation between activity of the mutated TACSTD1 allele and epigenetic inactivation of the corresponding MSH2 allele. Gene silencing by transcriptional read-through of a neighboring gene in either sense, as demonstrated here, or antisense direction, could represent a general mutational mechanism. Depending on the expression pattern of the neighboring gene that lacks its normal polyadenylation signal, this may cause either generalized or mosaic patterns of epigenetic inactivation.
In a three-stage genome-wide association study among East Asian women including 22,780 cases and 24,181 controls, we identified 3 genetic loci newly associated with breast cancer risk, including rs4951011 at 1q32.1 (in intron 2 of the ZC3H11A gene; P=8.82×10(-9)), rs10474352 at 5q14.3 (near the ARRDC3 gene; P=1.67×10(-9)) and rs2290203 at 15q26.1 (in intron 14 of the PRC1 gene; P=4.25×10(-8)). We replicated these associations in 16,003 cases and 41,335 controls of European ancestry (P=0.030, 0.004 and 0.010, respectively). Data from the ENCODE Project suggest that variants rs4951011 and rs10474352 might be located in an enhancer region and transcription factor binding sites, respectively. This study provides additional insights into the genetics and biology of breast cancer.
Seventeen amateur bowlers taking part in local bowling competitions were given either 40 mg of oxprenolol or placebo before the competitions, so that each subject played two competitions on oxprenolol and two on placebo in random order. All the bowlers had a relative tachycardia 15 min before the competition which was abolished by oxprenolol. A similar reduction in the heart rate during and after the compeptition was likewise seen after oxprenolol. The drug caused only minor changes in the systolic blood pressure in comparision with placebo. On the whole, the total scores of placebo and oxprenolol competitions did not differ significantly from each other, nor was there any difference between the scores of the trial competitions and the average results during previous season. However, when the bowlers were divided into subgroups according to the effect exerted by oxprenolol on performance, about one third of the bowlers did benefit from the oxprenolol treatment while 50% had worse results. The bowlers whose bowling performance was improved by oxprenolol exhibited significantly higher heart rates before, during and after the competition as compared with the subgroups not responding beneficially to the active drug. The effect of oxprenolol was most pronounced during the very first series and the harmful effect of the drug was mainly seen in the last series of the competition. One reason for the impairment of the general performance could conceivably be an "overrelaxed" state as indicated by the greater number of misses made by the bowlers when treated with oxprenolol.
Fibroadenomas are the most common breast tumors in women under 30 (refs. 1,2). Exome sequencing of eight fibroadenomas with matching whole-blood samples revealed recurrent somatic mutations solely in MED12, which encodes a Mediator complex subunit. Targeted sequencing of an additional 90 fibroadenomas confirmed highly frequent MED12 exon 2 mutations (58/98, 59%) that are probably somatic, with 71% of mutations occurring in codon 44. Using laser capture microdissection, we show that MED12 fibroadenoma mutations are present in stromal but not epithelial mammary cells. Expression profiling of MED12-mutated and wild-type fibroadenomas revealed that MED12 mutations are associated with dysregulated estrogen signaling and extracellular matrix organization. The fibroadenoma MED12 mutation spectrum is nearly identical to that of previously reported MED12 lesions in uterine leiomyoma but not those of other tumors. Benign tumors of the breast and uterus, both of which are key target tissues of estrogen, may thus share a common genetic basis underpinned by highly frequent and specific MED12 mutations.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis has been recently recognized in Graves' disease patients treated with propylthiouracil. We have experienced three adult cases of Graves' disease with main features being renal derangements. All three patients, who were between the ages of 22 and 82 years, had been treated with propylthiouracil for 2 to 5 years after a diagnosis of Graves' disease. After several weeks of upper respiratory tract infection or flu-like symptoms, they abruptly began to manifest proteinuria and hematuria concomitant with severe anemia. Their serum creatinine increased from normal levels to 1.2 to 3.6 mg/dL. Renal biopsy revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis without deposition of immune complexes (ie, pauci-immune type). Crescent formations were observed in 40% to 60% of the glomeruli in all three cases. The serum from the patients revealed positive perinuclear-ANCA and negative cytoplasmic-ANCA (C-ANCA) pattern, and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA titers were 120 to 502 ELISA Units/mL (normal, < 10 ELISA Units/mL). A withdrawal of propylthiouracil with or without immunosuppressive therapy ameliorated their renal derangements. Graves' disease patients should be placed under vigilant observation by monitoring their urinalysis and serum creatinine, especially when being treated with antithyroid drugs and when suffering from flu-like symptoms.
Monogenic causes of autoimmunity provide key insights into the complex regulation of the immune system. We report a new monogenic cause of autoimmunity resulting from de novo germline activating STAT3 mutations in five individuals with a spectrum of early-onset autoimmune disease, including type 1 diabetes. These findings emphasize the critical role of STAT3 in autoimmune disease and contrast with the germline inactivating STAT3 mutations that result in hyper IgE syndrome.
Effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the male reproductive system were investigated. Sexually mature (290 g) Sprague-Dawley rats were given single oral doses of TCDD sufficient to cause varying degrees of hypophagia and impaired body weight gain. The largest doses decreased plasma testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations by 90 and 75%, respectively, from ad libitum-fed control values, while decreasing seminal vesicle and ventral prostate weights by 68 and 48%. On Day 7, the approximate ED50 for these responses was 15 micrograms TCDD/kg, a nonlethal dose. Reductions in caput epididymis and testis weights were also observed. The androgenic deficiency was seen as early as 2 days after dosing and persisted for at least 12 days. Based on data from pair-fed control rats, only about half the decreases in accessory sex organ weights and in plasma androgen concentrations could be accounted for by TCDD-induced hypophagia or body weight loss. These signs of androgenic deficiency were not the result of stress (based in part on plasma corticosterone assays), nor could they be accounted for by the known effects of TCDD on steroid metabolism. While the TCDD-induced depression in plasma testosterone concentrations appears to be the primary event observed, the mechanism by which testosterone concentrations were decreased remains unknown. The androgenic deficiency may account for the male reproductive pathology and dysfunction in animals treated with overtly toxic doses of TCDD.
Repeated social stress experiences engender "behavioral sensitization" and may also increase the potential for abuse of psychomotor stimulants, particularly cocaine use during "binges."
Experimental protocols were designed to induce behavioral sensitization through exposures to social-defeat stress or injections of cocaine or morphine. The impact of stress, cocaine or morphine sensitization on cocaine self-administration was assessed using several protocols.
Behavioral sensitization was induced in male Long-Evans rats by four social-defeat stress episodes, each separated by 72 h. Expression was assessed following a challenge of D-amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) or cocaine (7.5 mg/kg or 10.0 mg/kg), 10-15 days after the last defeat. Sensitization to cocaine (15.0 mg/kg) or morphine (10.0 mg/kg) was induced via daily administrations for 10 days and later assessed by challenges with cocaine or morphine. Subsequently, i.v. self-administration of cocaine was analyzed for (i) rates of acquisition, (ii) sensitivity to various doses, (iii) "breaking points" during a progressive ratio schedule of cocaine reinforcement, and (iv) patterns of intake during a 24-h binge, in sensitized and control rats.
Social-defeat stress, cocaine or morphine administrations increased the locomotor response to stimulant challenges. During 24-h cocaine self-administration binges, sensitization to social-defeat stress or to cocaine prolonged responding, resulting in more cocaine intake. In addition, cocaine sensitization increased the rate of acquisition to cocaine self-administration and the breaking point during a progressive ratio schedule.
The process of sensitization to social-defeat stress or cocaine intensifies cocaine intake during a binge, supporting the hypothesis that sensitization may facilitate the transition to compulsive drug taking.
We report a case of a 25-day old, former 34-week gestation male newborn who experienced neonatal seizures following administration of subcutaneous lidocaine for regional anesthesia during an elective circumcision prior to discharge.
Autism is a complex, largely genetic psychiatric disorder. In the majority of cases, the cause of autism is not known, but there is strong evidence for a genetic etiology. To identify candidate genes, the physical mapping of balanced chromosomal aberrations is a powerful strategy, since several genes have been characterized in numerous disorders. In this study, the authors analyzed a balanced reciprocal translocation arising de novo in a subject with autism and mental retardation.
The authors performed the physical mapping of the balanced 9q23/10q22 translocation by fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments using bacterial artificial chromosome clones covering the areas of interest.
Findings revealed that the KCNMA1 gene, which encodes the alpha-subunit of the large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channel, a synaptic regulator of neuronal excitability, is physically disrupted. Further molecular and functional analyses showed the haploinsufficiency of this gene as well as decreased activity of the coded BK(Ca )channel. This activity can be enhanced in vitro by addition of a BK(Ca )channel opener (BMS-204352). Further mutational analyses on 116 autistic subjects led to the identification of an amino acid substitution located in a highly conserved domain of the protein not found in comparison subjects.
These results suggest a possible association between a functional defect of the BK(Ca) channel and autistic disorder and raise the hypothesis that deficits in synaptic transmission may contribute to the physiopathology of autism and mental deficiency.
Frequent failure and severe side effects of current sarcoma therapy warrants new therapeutic approaches. The small-molecule MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a activates the p53 pathway and efficiently induces apoptosis in tumours with amplified MDM2 gene and overexpression of MDM2 protein. However, the majority of human sarcomas have normal level of MDM2 and the therapeutic potential of MDM2 antagonists in this group is still unclear. We have investigated if Nutlin-3a could be employed to augment the response to traditional therapy and/or reduce the genotoxic burden of chemotherapy.
A panel of sarcoma cell lines with different TP53 and MDM2 status were treated with Nutlin-3a combined with Doxorubicin, Methotrexate or Cisplatin, and their combination index determined.
Clear synergism was observed when Doxorubicin and Nutlin-3a were combined in cell lines with wild-type TP53 and amplified MDM2, or with Methotrexate in both MDM2 normal and amplified sarcoma cell lines, allowing for up to tenfold reduction of cytotoxic drug dose. Interestingly, Nutlin-3a seemed to potentiate the effect of classical drugs as Doxorubicin and Cisplatin in cell lines with mutated TP53, but inhibited the effect of Methotrexate.
The use of Nutlin in combination with classical sarcoma chemotherapy shows promising preclinical potential, but since clear biomarkers are still lacking, clinical trials should be followed up with detailed tumour profiling.
The catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor tolcapone was compared with the dopamine agonist bromocriptine in an open-label, randomized trial involving 146 levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients with end-of-dose deterioration of efficacy. Tolcapone was given at a dosage of 200 mg three times daily; bromocriptine was titrated from 1.25 mg once daily at baseline to, at most, 10 mg three times daily by day 24 (mean final dose 22.4 mg/day). After 8 weeks, the tolcapone group had a significant reduction in daily levodopa dose compared with the bromocriptine group (p<0.05). No significant differences in the "on/off" time and motor disability were seen between the tolcapone and bromocriptine treatment groups. Bromocriptine induced more hallucinations, orthostatic hypotension, and nausea, whereas tolcapone therapy was associated with more muscle cramps and dystonia. These results suggest that when added to levodopa therapy, the two drugs have a different side effect profile, with the advantages for tolcapone being absence of titration and quicker efficacy.
The alkylating antitumor agents mitomycin A (MMA), mitomycin C (MMC), and seven N7 analogs were compared in terms of their cardiotoxic and antitumor activity in vitro. Neonatal rat-heart myocytes were sensitive to five of the compounds studied, including MMA, 7-dimethylamidinomitosane (BMY-25282), 7-(N-methyl-piperazinyl)-mitosane (RR-194), N7-(4-iodophenyl)-MMC (RR-208), and N7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-MMC (M-83) in order of descending molar potency. MMA and RR-208 possessed the greatest cytotoxic potency against 8226 human myeloma tumor cells in vitro. Two of the nine mitomycins studied, BMY-25282 and M-83, showed greater cytotoxic potency for heart cells. For these two agents, the ratio of the 50% inhibitory concentration in heart cells to that in 8226 myeloma cells was 50 and 32, respectively. For the other analogs, the tumor-cell cytotoxic potency was much higher (ranging from 200 to 7,000). For the nine mitomycin compounds, a correlation was found between heart-cell toxicity and low reduction potentials (E1/2 values) ranging from -0.16 to -0.37 V. Thus, as the reduction potential decreased (easier reducibility), the cardiotoxic potency in vitro increased (r = 0.81). In contrast, mitomycins with reduction potentials of higher than -0.37 V were much less potent cardiotoxins. Thus, mitomycin C (E1/2 = -0.45 V) was noncardiotoxic even when tested at concentrations 100-fold above those pharmacologically achievable in humans. Mitomycin C also failed to enhance doxorubicin (Adriamycin) cardiotoxicity in vitro. Importantly, no correlation was found between the reduction potential and the antitumor activity of the nine analogs (n = 0.51), in this small series.
To report a case of a microprolactinoma in a male-to-female transsexual treated with estrogens and cyproterone acetate.
Case report.
Endocrinology unit in a university hospital.
A 33-year-old male-to-female transsexual with prolactin level of 10 ng/mL.
Treatment with equine-conjugated estrogens (2.5 mg/day, orally) and cyproterone acetate (100 mg/day, orally) during 6 months.
Her levels of prolactin were repeatedly found to be elevated to a maximum of 133 ng/mL, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a pituitary mass of 5x4x4 mm.
Discontinuation of the cross-sex hormone treatment did not reduce the levels of prolactin. The use of dopaminergic-agonist therapy normalized them and reduced the size of the microadenoma. After sex-reassignment surgery, she was treated with low-dose estradiol transdermal patches and presented normal levels of prolactin and appropriate levels of 17beta-estradiol and testosterone with a stable image in MRI.
We report a case of prolactinoma after treatment with equine-conjugated estrogens and cyproterone acetate. We recommend long-term follow-up observation consisting of a periodic evaluation of prolactin levels and any symptoms suggestive of hyperprolactinemia to detect as early as possible complications derived from cross-sex hormone therapy.
One single clinical complication of grand mal seizures in conjunction with the subarachnoid administration of the new non-ionic contrast medium metrizamide is reported in a patient who had been taking chlorpromazine. An interaction between the contrast medium and phenothiazine derivatives is considered probable.
The effect of curcumin on lysosomal hydrolases in serum and heart was studied by determining the activities of beta-glucuronidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, cathepsin B, cathepsin D, and acid phosphatase. Rats treated with isoproterenol (30 mg/100 g body weight) showed a significant increase in serum lysosomal hydrolase activities, which were found to decrease after curcumin treatment. Isoproterenol administration to rats resulted in decreased stability of the membranes, which was reflected by the lowered activity of cathepsin D in mitochondrial, lysosomal, and microsomal fractions. Curcumin treatment returned the activity levels almost to normal, showing that curcumin restored the normal function of the membrane. Histopathological studies of the infarcted rat heart also showed a decreased degree of necrosis after curcumin treatment.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are being used more frequently in the treatment of various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although adverse effects of MAOI treatment are widely known, withdrawal symptoms are less well known. They include nausea, sweating, palpitations, nightmares, and psychosis. Withdrawal reactions from combination therapy with an MAOI and another agent are seldom described. Reported here is the occurrence of myoclonic seizures after the abrupt discontinuation of phenelzine and alprazolam. Alterations in the GABA and serotonin neurotransmitter systems as a result of withdrawal of the MAOI and the benzodiazepine may account for the seizures.
This study was designed to estimate the partial and complete response rates (CR and PR) of two novel drug pairs (vincristine and melphalan vs. ifosfamide and etoposide) and to improve overall survival of previously untreated patients with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.
One hundred twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to phase II window therapy consisting of vincristine and melphalan (VM-containing regimen) or ifosfamide and etoposide (IE-containing regimen). Brief window therapy (12 wks) was immediately followed-up by vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC), chemotherapy, surgery, and irradiation, with continuation of either VM or IE in patients with initial response. Major endpoints were initial CR and PR rates after the phase II window phase of therapy, failure-free survival (FFS), and survival.
Patients who received the VM-containing regimen experienced significantly more anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and had more cyclophosphamide dose reductions. The initial PR and CR rates were not significantly different for patients treated with either regimen (VM, 74%; IE, 79%; P = 0.428). However, FFS and overall survival (OS) at 3 years were significantly better with the IE-containing regimen (FFS: 33% vs. 19%; P = 0.043; OS: 55% vs. 27%; P = 0.012).
Although the VM-containing regimen produced a high response rate, inclusion of melphalan appeared to limit the cyclophosphamide dose that could be administered, and ultimately, this regimen was associated with a significantly worse outcome than was the IE-containing regimen. Also, the IE-containing regimen was associated with a gratifyingly high survival rate at 3 years (55%), which is significantly higher than has been observed on any previous Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group regimen for similar patients. We believe that this promising outcome indicates that this drug pair merits further randomized testing in metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.
Aims of this study were to: (1) demonstrate whether quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography could detect an index of myocardial blood flow reserve through the analysis of refilling curves generated by microbubble transit into myocardium both at rest and after vasodilatation induced by dipyridamole; and (2) explore with this method myocardial microcirculatory function in two different models (ie, patients with essential hypertension and control subjects).
Two groups of strictly age-matched men were studied (case-control study): 12 patients who were adults (28.2 +/- 0.2 years) and asymptomatic with never-treated essential hypertension, a mild degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, and normal left ventricular function; and 12 control subjects. Quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed in all study participants. We used second-generation ultrasound microbubbles as echocardiography contrast agent. Real-time color-coded power modulation was performed with a phased-array system interfaced to a S3 transducer (1.3-3.6 MHz).
In control subjects there was little increase in myocardial blood volume (30%) between basal and hyperemic status (P <.05); in patients with hypertension this parameter increased by 22% (P <.05). Myocardial blood velocity increased after dipyridamole by 270% in control subjects (P <.01), whereas for patients with hypertension this parameter increased only by 150% (P <.02). The index of myocardial blood flow reserve was significantly lower for patients with hypertension than in control subjects (3.3 +/- 0.3 vs 4.4 +/- 0.3, respectively; P <.01).
Results of our study documented that myocardial microcirculation in young adult patients with hypertension showed an early impairment in the vasodilatation capacity of the resistance arterioles under dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, as demonstrated by a reduction of myocardial blood flow reserve. Myocardial blood velocity increased after dipyridamole induction in control subjects, whereas patients with hypertension showed a significantly lesser increase. Myocardial blood flow reserve was significantly lower for patients with hypertension because of an early impairment in vasodilatation capacity of resistance arterioles under dipyridamole-induced hyperemia.
Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress that blunt insulin response in its target tissues, leading to insulin resistance (IR). IR is a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle is responsible for 75% of total insulin-dependent glucose uptake; consequently, skeletal muscle IR is considered to be the primary defect of systemic IR development. Interestingly, some obese people stay insulin-sensitive and metabolically healthy. With the aim of understanding this difference and identifying the mechanisms responsible for insulin sensitivity maintenance/IR development during obesity, we explored the role of the latent endoribonuclease (RNase L) in skeletal muscle cells. RNase L is a regulator of innate immunity, of double-stranded RNA sensors and of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling. It is regulated during inflammation by interferons and its activity is dependent on its binding to 2-5A, an oligoadenylate synthesized by oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS). Increased expression of RNase L or downregulation of its inhibitor (RLI) improved insulin response in mouse myogenic C2C12 cells and in primary human myotubes from normal-weight subjects treated with palmitate, a saturated free fatty acid (FFA) known to induce inflammation and oxidative stress via TLR4 activation. While RNase L and RLI levels remained unchanged, OAS level was decreased in primary myotubes from insulin-resistant obese subjects (OB-IR) compared with myotubes from insulin-sensitive obese subjects (OB-IS). TLR3 and mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) were also underexpressed in OB-IR myotubes. Activation of RNase L by 2-5A transfection allowed to restore insulin response, OAS, MnSOD and TLR3 expression in OB-IR myotubes. Due to low expression of OAS, OB-IR myotubes present a defect in RNase L activation and TLR3 regulation. Consequently, MnSOD level is low and insulin sensitivity is reduced. These results support that RNase L activity limits FFA/obesity-induced impairment of insulin response in muscle cells via TLR3 and MnSOD expression.
To investigate the significance of Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) expression and its relationship with angiogenesis during experimental fibrosis.
Cirrhosis was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of diethyl nitrosamine (DEN). The serial sections from liver tissues were stained with anti-CD34 and anti-TSP-1 antibodies before being quantitated by light microscopy.
Our results showed that of TSP-1 expression gradually increases according to the severity of fibrosis (P < 0.05). Moreover, TSP-1 expression was found to be correlated with angiogenesis (P < 0.05).
The correlative evidence of the link between TSP-1 and fibrosis or angiogenesis provided by this study suggests that besides its role as a strong promoter of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), TSP-1 might have an additional role in liver fibrogenesis by stimulating angiogenesis and this protein could be a potential target to prevent fibrogenesis in chronic inflammatory diseases of the liver.
In the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy, mossy fibers coexpress the inhibitory transmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) with glutamate. The effects of endogenous and applied NPY on recurrent mossy fiber synaptic transmission were investigated with the use of whole-cell voltage-clamp and field recordings in rat hippocampal slices. Applied NPY reversibly inhibited synaptic transmission at recurrent mossy fiber synapses on dentate granule cells but not at perforant path or associational-commissural synapses. It also reduced the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in granule cells from epileptic, but not control, rats and depressed granule cell epileptiform activity dependent on the recurrent mossy fiber pathway. These actions of NPY were mediated by activation of presynaptic Y2 receptors. The Y2 receptor antagonist (S)-N2-[[1-[2-[4-[(R,S)-5,11-dihydro-6(6H)-oxodibenz[b,e]azepin-11-yl]-1-piperazinyl]-2-oxoethyl]cyclopentyl]acetyl]-N-[2-[1,2-dihydro-3,5(4H)-dioxo-1,2-diphenyl-3H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]ethyl]argininamide (BIIE0246) not only blocked the effects of NPY but also enhanced recurrent mossy fiber synaptic transmission, the frequency of mEPSCs, and the magnitude of mossy fiber-evoked granule cell epileptiform activity when applied by itself. Several observations supported the selectivity of BIIE0246. These results suggest that even the spontaneous release of NPY (or an active metabolite) from recurrent mossy fibers is sufficient to depress glutamate release from this pathway. Tonic release of NPY accounts at least partially for the low probability of glutamate release from recurrent mossy fiber terminals, impedes the ability of these fibers to synchronize granule cell discharge, and may protect the hippocampus from seizures that involve the entorhinal cortex. This pathway may synchronize granule cell discharge more effectively in human brain than in rat because of its lower expression of NPY.
Circulating markers indicating the instability of atherosclerotic plaques could have diagnostic value in unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. We evaluated pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), a potentially proatherosclerotic metalloproteinase, as a marker of acute coronary syndromes.
We examined the level of expression of PAPP-A in eight culprit unstable coronary plaques and four stable plaques from eight patients who had died suddenly of cardiac causes. We also measured circulating levels of PAPP-A, C-reactive protein, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in 17 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 20 with unstable angina, 19 with stable angina, and 13 controls without atherosclerosis.
PAPP-A was abundantly expressed in plaque cells and extracellular matrix of ruptured and eroded unstable plaques, but not in stable plaques. Circulating PAPP-A levels were significantly higher in patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction than in patients with stable angina and controls (P<0.001). A PAPP-A threshold value of 10 mlU per liter identified patients who had acute coronary syndromes with a sensitivity of 89.2 percent and a specificity of 81.3 percent. PAPP-A levels correlated with levels of C-reactive protein and free IGF-I, but not with markers of myocardial injury (troponin I and the MB isoform of creatine kinase).
PAPP-A is present in unstable plaques, and circulating levels are elevated in acute coronary syndromes; these increased levels may reflect the instability of atherosclerotic plaques. PAPP-A is a new candidate marker of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction.
Renal proximal tubule cell injury is an important side effect of the chemotherapeutic agent ifosfamide in humans. We investigated the effect of this medication on kidney function in rats. Animals received either 40 or 80 mg kg(-1) ifosfamide intraperitoneally daily for 3 days every 3 weeks for a total of four treatment courses. Ifosfamide-treated rats had significantly lower body weight and hematocrit than sterile water-treated control rats. Animals receiving 40 mg kg(-1) ifosfamide developed isolated phosphaturia after their fourth and final treatment course. Rats receiving 80 mg kg(-1) ifosfamide had low-grade glucosuria, phosphaturia and proteinuria throughout the study. Urine flow rate, creatinine clearance, urinary sodium and potassium excretion and kidney glutathione and malondialdehyde content were not affected by ifosfamide at either dose. These findings indicate that ifosfamide produces abnormalities in rat renal function resembling subclinical Fanconi syndrome.
Oleanolic acid and ursolic acid are triterpenoid compounds that exist widely in food, medicinal herbs and other plants. This review summarizes the pharmacological studies on these two triterpenoids. Both oleanolic acid and ursolic acid are effective in protecting against chemically induced liver injury in laboratory animals. Oleanolic acid has been marketed in China as an oral drug for human liver disorders. The mechanism of hepatoprotection by these two compounds may involve the inhibition of toxicant activation and the enhancement of the body defense systems. Oleanolic acid and ursolic acid have also been long-recognized to have antiinflammatory and antihyperlipidemic properties in laboratory animals, and more research is warranted to develop a therapy for patients. Recently, both compounds have been noted for their antitumor-promotion effects, which are stimulating additional research in this field. Oleanolic acid and ursolic acid are relatively non-toxic, and have been used in cosmetics and health products. The possible mechanisms for the pharmacological effects and the prospects for these two compounds are discussed.
Environmental and occupational mutagens such as chemical agents are suspected to be involved in cancer development. However, a direct link between carcinogen exposure and genetic alterations has been established only in a few examples. Carcinogen involvement in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was recently supported by reports of an increased frequency of RCC among workers exposed to Trichloroethylene (TRI) in Germany. The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotype and the genotype of renal tumors in occupationally TRI-exposed patients. Sporadic RCCs from TRI nonexposed patients served as control. Normal and renal tumor tissues from 12 patients with occupational histories of solvents and TRI exposure were histologically analyzed. Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) was used to screen for genomic alterations along all chromosomal arms. Tumor DNA was analyzed for mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) on 3p25.5 by PCR and sequencing analyses. The histological analysis revealed 9 clear cell (75%), 2 papillary RCC (18%) and 1 oncocytoma (8%). In clear cell RCC, DNA losses were frequently observed on 3p (66%), 6q (56%), 9p and 4q (44% each) and 2q (33%). DNA gains were detected on 9q, 17 (33% each) and 5q (22%). DNA gains were identified on chromosome 7 and 17 in papillary RCC. Four VHL gene mutations were found in three clear cell RCC (33%) with 3p loss. Comparisons of these results with data obtained from sporadic RCC revealed no unique phenotype, genotype or mutation pattern in the VHL gene of renal tumors after TRI exposure. Therefore, further studies on the relevance of dose and exposure time for the nephrocarcinogenic effect of TRI are indicated.
