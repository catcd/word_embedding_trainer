Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer, but account for only a small fraction of breast cancer susceptibility. To find additional genes conferring susceptibility to breast cancer, we analyzed CHEK2 (also known as CHK2), which encodes a cell-cycle checkpoint kinase that is implicated in DNA repair processes involving BRCA1 and p53 (refs 3,4,5). We show that CHEK2(*)1100delC, a truncating variant that abrogates the kinase activity, has a frequency of 1.1% in healthy individuals. However, this variant is present in 5.1% of individuals with breast cancer from 718 families that do not carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (P = 0.00000003), including 13.5% of individuals from families with male breast cancer (P = 0.00015). We estimate that the CHEK2(*)1100delC variant results in an approximately twofold increase of breast cancer risk in women and a tenfold increase of risk in men. By contrast, the variant confers no increased cancer risk in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This suggests that the biological mechanisms underlying the elevated risk of breast cancer in CHEK2 mutation carriers are already subverted in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which is consistent with participation of the encoded proteins in the same pathway.
Tesaglitazar was developed as a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα/γ). To support the clinical program, a hamster carcinogenicity study was performed. The only neoplastic findings possibly related to treatment with tesaglitazar were low incidences of hemangioma and hemangiosarcoma in the liver of male animals. A high-power, two-year investigative study with interim necropsies was performed to further elucidate these findings. Treatment with tesaglitazar resulted in changes typical for exaggerated PPARα pharmacology in rodents, such as hepatocellular hypertrophy and hepatocellular carcinoma, but not an increased frequency of hemangiosarcomas. At the highest dose level, there was an increased incidence of sinusoidal dilatation and hemangiomas. No increased endothelial cell (EC) proliferation was detected in vivo, which was confirmed by in vitro administration to ECs. Immunohistochemistry and gene expression analyses indicated increased cellular stress and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the liver, which may have contributed to the sinusoidal dilatation. A two-fold increase in the level of circulating VEGF was detected in the hamster at all dose levels, whereas no effect on VEGF was observed in patients treated with tesaglitazar. In conclusion, investigations have demonstrated that tesaglitazar does not produce hemangiosarcomas in hamster despite a slight effect on vascular morphology in the liver.
At the age of 25, pregnant with her 2nd child, a woman was diagnosed as having pituitary necrosis resulting from hemorrhagic shock, in turn the result of a clotting defect caused by an amniotic fluid embolism. For the next 17 years, her daily replacement therapy included 50 mg ma of cortisone, 120 mg of thyroid, and .5-1 mg of diethylstilbestrol given cyclically (21 days). When an exploratory laparotomy was performed on her at age 42 because of abdominal mass,an endometrial adenocarcinoma and varying degrees of hyperplasia were found. A total abdominal hysterectomy was performed, but a year later it became clear that the patient had diffuse carcinomatosis, and 2 months later she died. Prolonged unopposed estrogen therapy is suggested as the cause of the endometrial cancer, rather than pituitary disturbance.
Intrathecal administration of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) produces mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia, and touch-evoked allodynia in rats. Experiments were conducted to examine the effects of intrathecal administration of relatively selective PGE(2) receptor (EP receptor) agonists to establish which spinal EP receptors mediate these behavioral effects of spinally administered PGE(2). Administration of either sulprostone (EP(3) receptor agonist) or PGE(1) alcohol (EP(4) receptor agonist) produced marked mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and touch-evoked allodynia. Neither 17-phenyl trinor PGE(2) (EP(1) receptor agonist) nor butaprost (EP(2) receptor agonist) produced any significant changes in behavioral response thresholds to mechanical or thermal stimuli. However, 17-phenyl trinor PGE(2) (EP(1) receptor agonist) did produce marked touch-evoked allodynia. These data suggest that in rats activation of spinal EP(3) and EP(4) receptors by PGE(2) is important for development of both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia as well as for touch-evoked allodynia. PGE(2)-induced allodynia also appears to involve activation of spinal EP(1) receptors.
Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is a metabolic derangement that is linked to the distribution of folate pools, which provide one-carbon units for biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate and for remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine. In humans, methionine synthase deficiency results in the accumulation of methyltetrahydrofolate at the expense of folate derivatives required for purine and thymidylate biosynthesis. Complete ablation of methionine synthase activity in mice results in embryonic lethality. Other mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia have normal or reduced levels of methyltetrahydrofolate and are not embryonic lethal, although they have decreased ratios of AdoMet/AdoHcy and impaired methylation. We have constructed a mouse model with a gene trap insertion in the Mtrr gene specifying methionine synthase reductase, an enzyme essential for the activity of methionine synthase. This model is a hypomorph, with reduced methionine synthase reductase activity, thus avoiding the lethality associated with the absence of methionine synthase activity. Mtrr(gt/gt) mice have increased plasma homocyst(e)ine, decreased plasma methionine, and increased tissue methyltetrahydrofolate. Unexpectedly, Mtrr(gt/gt) mice do not show decreases in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio in most tissues. The different metabolite profiles in the various genetic mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia may be useful in understanding biological effects of elevated homocyst(e)ine.
To evaluate whether dopamine transport system imaging by FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can be helpful to differentiate idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) from secondary Parkinsonism induced by amiodarone.
Twenty-two patients with Parkinsonism during amiodarone therapy were evaluated by clinical neurological examination and FP-CIT SPECT. Thereafter, amiodarone was discontinued whenever possible and antiparkinsonian treatment was modified, if required. Clinical neurological status was reevaluated within a year of the SPECT examination.
At baseline, clinical neurological examination was quite similar in all patients. No clinical symptom was able to clearly orientate the diagnosis toward IPD or drug-induced Parkinsonism. Using SPECT, the number of normal and abnormal patients was evenly distributed. In the abnormal SPECT group, amiodarone was modified in seven patients of whom six improved at follow-up. Antiparkinsonian treatment had been modified in all the patients. In the four cases with no amiodarone changes, clinical improvement was noted if antiparkinsonian treatment was optimized (three patients). In the 11 normal SPECT patients, amiodarone was modified in five patients. All patients ameliorated (two) or even normalized (three). In the six patients with normal SPECT in whom amiodarone had not been modified, symptoms remained stable despite the absence of antiparkinsonian treatment.
In patients treated with amiodarone, IPD is sometimes clinically difficult to differentiate from drug-induced Parkinsonism. Using FP-CIT, a normal scan suggests drug-induced Parkinsonism, hence, there is no need for antiparkinsonian treatment and all possible attempts to reduce or preferably stop amiodarone. An abnormal scan, on the other hand, indicates IPD. In this case, treating IPD seems to have more impact on motor changes than modifying the antiarrhythmic drug.
A women with beta-thalassemia intermedia, and iron overload following many years' treatment with oral iron, was treated with subcutaneous desferrioxamine. During the course of this treatment she developed tinnitus, which was considered to be a rare complication of the use of this chelating agent. The mechanism of this effect is not understood.
Eosinophilic cystitis is an unusual form of cystitis which is characterized by irritative voiding symptoms and haematuria. In the report herein two adult cases of eosinophilic cystitis treated with intravesical Mitomycin-C instillations for prophylaxis of bladder carcinoma are presented and the literature is reviewed.
Primary persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia is characterised by clinical symptoms that occur when blood glucose levels drop below the normal range. Diazoxide treatment remains the mainstay of medical therapy. Tolerance of diazoxide is usually excellent, but several side effects of this drug have been described. We present a 4-month-old girl who developed pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and neutropenia during diazoxide therapy. Diazoxide toxicity was suspected and the drug was withdrawn on day 13. During the next 3 days, respiratory and haemodynamic status dramatically improved and she was weaned from mechanical ventilation. Control white blood cell count was 8800 cells/mm(3) and a new echocardiography showed modreduction of pulmonary artificial pressure to 20 mmHg and resolution of atrial and ventricular enlargement. Paediatric physicians should be in mind of pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and neutropenia developing during diazoxide therapy.
The locomotor activities induced by methamphetamine (MAP: 1 mg/kg) following the microinjection of either GABA or three synthesized GABA-peptides (PLG, PSLG, PDSLG) into the rat caudate putamen or the amygdala were measured by using behavioral analysis. The ip administration of MAP induced hyperactivities in a time-dependent manner, and the maximum activity was measured 30 min after MAP administration. This hyperactivity was observed for more than 2 hrs. By the microinjection of GABA-peptides (0.054-540 nmol) into each brain region, the MAP-induced hyperactivity was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner, although the single administration of examined dosages of these peptides did not influence the locomotor activity. In the case of microinjection of GABA into either one of the brain regions, only the larger dosage (27,000 nmol) significantly reduced the MAP-induced hyperactivity, whereas this inhibition was less than that seen at the dose of 540 nmol of GABA-peptides. Furthermore, the microinjection of newly synthesized GABA-peptides, PSLG and PDSLG, into the caudate putamen was more effective than those obtained by injection into the amygdala. However, either microinjection of PLG or GABA into both regions showed similar inhibition. These results suggest that the pharmacological properties of newly synthesized GABA-peptides are different compared to those of PLG and GABA, and that these differences might be due to the primary inhibitory effects of the serine-contained GABA-peptides on dopaminergic neuronal activity, but not on GABA neurons.
In a randomized, comparative, clinical trial, caspofungin was found to be as effective as amphotericin B deoxycholate (ampho B) for treating candidemia (favorable outcomes in 71.7% and 62.8% of patients, respectively) and exhibited a generally better safety profile, particularly with respect to impaired renal function (IRF) (P = 0.02).
The goal of this study was to examine whether cost savings generated from the reduced rates of IRF observed in the clinical trial would be enough to offset the higher acquisition cost of caspofungin relative to ampho B.
We developed an economic model in which 100 hypothetical patients with candidemia were treated with caspofungin or ampho B. Rates of IRF and duration of drug therapy were taken from the clinical trial. Information on the cost of treating IRF was obtained through a search of MEDLINE using the terms amphotericin and cost, amphotericin and resource, amphotericin and hospital, and amphotericin and toxicity; and the medical subject headings kidney failure, acute/drug therapy; kidney failure, acute/epidemiology; kidney failure, acute/etiology; kidney/drug effects; cost of illness; costs and cost analysis; kidney failure, acute, and economics; and kidney failure, acute/economics. In addition, the Web site was searched for relevant references, and the Merck publication alert system was used. Antifungal drug costs were estimated using data from IMS Health. Costs were reported in year-2003 US dollars.
In the base case, the model projected that using caspofungin instead of ampho B would result in substantially lower treatment costs for IRF, which would more than offset the higher drug acquisition cost (cost-offset percentage, 122%), leading to a net mean savings of 758.60 US dollars per patient. These results were not very sensitive to the difference in daily drug cost, but were sensitive to the mean cost attributable to treating IRF. As that varied, the cost-offset percentage varied from 61% (substantial cost offset) to 183% (cost savings).
The results of this economic model suggest that, based only on differences in drug acquisition cost and renal toxicity, the use of caspofungin instead of ampho B in patients with candidemia may be a cost-saving strategy from the perspective of a hospital.
Inhalation exposure to 300 ppm ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) for 3 days produced degenerative changes in spermatocytes of pachytene and meiotic division at spermatogenic stage XIV in rats. However, a wide range of germ cell types including spermatogonia was affected and the stage-specific damage was not discernible after 2 weeks exposure to 300 ppm EGME. The stage-specific damage was related to exposure concentration-time course. In early stages, degenerating spermatocytes showed nuclear chromatin clumping around synaptonemal complexes, cytoplasmic vesiculation with electron-dense material deposition, and disruption of the plasma membrane. Chromosomal microtubules in the meiotic division of spermatocytes were discontinued with deposition of electron-dense chromatin material. Sertoli cells showed cytoplasmic vacuolization, contact loss to germ cells, and cytoplasmic processes fragmentation with disrupted microtubules. Degenerative pachytene or meiotic spermatocytes were associated with disrupted Sertoli-germ cell relationship, chromosomal microtubules, and synaptonemal complexes. Spermatid degeneration and giant cell formation were observed after spermatocyte degeneration. Spermatid degeneration appeared to be a secondary change resulting from disrupted Sertoli-to-germ cell association. After 14 days post-exposure (PE) following 2 weeks exposure, some tubules were lined with regenerating spermatocytes with or without round spermatids. By 42 days PE, many tubules regained normal germinal epithelium, but some tubules were still atrophic even after 84 days PE. Reversibility of testicular atrophy was inversely proportional to severity of damaged stem cells.
To investigate the K-ras gene mutations in asbestos and welding-fumes related human lung cancer (hLC), comparing with the mutational spectrum of K-ras gene in non-occupational hLC, 8 cases of non-occupational hLC, 9 cases of asbestos-related hLC and 4 cases of welding-fumes related hLC were collected. The techniques of genomic DNA extraction, nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA direct sequencing were employed.
showed the mutation frequencies of K-ras gene were 25% in non-occupational hLC and welding-fumes related hLC, whereas 44.4% in asbestos-related hLC. Mutations mainly occurred in codons 12 and 15. A mutation of codon 13 was detected in welding-fumes related hLC. The type of base substitution was principally G-->T transversion in non-occupational hLC, whereas mainly G-->A transition in asbestos and welding-fumes related hLC. THE RESULTS suggested there were obvious differences of K-ras gene mutations among non-occupational hLC, asbestos and silica related hLC. Therefore, different mechanisms of carcinogenesis were implicated among them. However, no speific spectrum of K-ras gene mutation can be derived from welding-fumes related hLC because of the limitation of samples.
The polymerase chain reaction method was used to diagnose herpes simplex encephalitis in children. Initial samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 15 patients with herpes simplex encephalitis were all positive for the herpes simplex virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction assay. In terms of early diagnosis, polymerase chain reaction assay became positive significantly earlier than the detection of intrathecally produced anti-herpes simplex virus antibody using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (4.4 vs 8.9 days after onset; P less than .01). Serial examinations showed that the presence of virus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid continued for 3 to 18 days after the neurologic onset (mean 10.1 days). Four of the 15 patients had a relapse of encephalitis after completing acyclovir therapy. The mean duration of initial acyclovir therapy in the recurrent group was significantly shorter than that in the nonrecurrent group. In recurring cases, herpes simplex virus DNA reappeared temporarily in the cerebrospinal fluid of two patients. These results show that polymerase chain reaction assay is a useful diagnostic tool for the early and noninvasive diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis in children. Results also suggest that a comparatively short duration of acyclovir therapy may be related to a relapse of herpes simplex encephalitis in some children.
The effect of abrupt discontinuation of nifedipine (N) on exercise tolerance and myocardial ischemia was studied in 7 patients with stable angina pectoris of effort (AP). N was administered in a dose of 20 mg 4 times a day for 34 days. Exercise treadmill tests were performed before N therapy in placebo treatment, on N treatment day 1, 28, on the first day after abrupt N discontinuation and 8 days after the latter. Upon acute and regular administration N produced a significant improvement in exercise tolerance before the onset of AP, development of moderate AP and up to 1 mm depression of ST-segment. Abrupt N discontinuation resulted in substantial deterioration in exercise performance pronounced more definitely on hour 21 and 24 after the last dose intake. A substantial increase in the sum of ST-segment depression at the onset of AP and at the development of AP of moderate severity occurred on the first day of N withdrawal. 8 days after N cessation all the exercise parameters returned to the baseline levels. We conclude that abrupt cessation of regular N therapy may cause a withdrawal syndrome which manifested with a decrease in the exercise tolerance and an increase in exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.
Standard treatment for patients with disseminated germ cell tumors is combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP). This treatment is highly effective, but the majority of patients experience severe adverse effects during treatment and are at risk of developing considerable long-term morbidity, including second malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary toxicity. One neglected side effect is the significant muscular fatigue mentioned by many patients with testicular cancer both during and after treatment. Very limited information exists concerning the patho-physiological effects of antineoplastic agents on skeletal muscle. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of BEP-treatment on the skeletal musculature in testicular cancer patients, and to examine whether the expected treatment-induced muscular deterioration can be attenuated or even reversed by high intensity progressive resistance training (HIPRT).
The PROTRACT study is a randomized controlled trial in 30 testicular cancer patients undergoing three cycles of BEP chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized to either a 9-week HIPRT program (STR) initiated at the onset of treatment, or to standard care (UNT). 15 healthy matched control subjects (CON) will complete the same HIPRT program. All participants will take part in 3 assessment rounds (baseline, 9 wks, 21 wks) including muscle biopsies, maximum muscle strength tests, whole body DXA scan and blood samples.
mean fiber area and fiber type composition measured by histochemical analyses, satellite cells and levels of protein and mRNA expression of intracellular mediators of protein turnover.
maximum muscle strength and muscle power measured by maximum voluntary contraction and leg-extensor-power tests, body composition assessed by DXA scan, and systemic inflammation analyzed by circulating inflammatory markers, lipid and glucose metabolism in blood samples. Health related Quality of Life (QoL) will be assessed by validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, SF-36).
This study investigates the muscular effects of antineoplastic agents in testicular cancer patients, and furthermore evaluates whether HIPRT has a positive influence on side effects related to chemotherapy. A more extensive knowledge of the interaction between cytotoxic-induced physiological impairment and exercise-induced improvement is imperative for the future development of optimal rehabilitation programs for cancer patients.

Tako-tsubo-like cardiomyopathy is characterized by acute chest pain, electrocardiographic changes and increased cardiac enzymes in the absence of obstructive coronary vessel disease. We describe the development of tako-tsubo-like cardiomyopathy in an elderly woman after the use of an EpiPen for generalized urticaria and angioedema. As adrenaline may participate in the pathogenesis of this condition, the need for careful patient selection and education in the use of adrenaline self-injectors remains imperative.
Niacin (vitamin B3) is promoted for rapidly clearing the body of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and cannabis, and is alleged to interfere with urine drug screening. We present 4 cases of such novel use associated with significant adverse effects. Two cases had isolated skin manifestations, whereas the other 2 presented with life-threatening manifestations, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hepatotoxicity, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia evolving into hyperglycemia. One patient also had profound neutrophilia and QT(C)-interval prolongation. All patients improved after cessation of the drug use and supportive treatment. Health care providers should be aware of these potential adverse effects of niacin and of the misguided use of this vitamin by patients seeking to interfere with urine drug screening.
The interaction between piperazine and chlorpromazine has been studied in rats and mice. Piperazine administered a few hours previously potentiated the action of chlorpromazine on the central nervous system. No such interaction was found between piperazine and prochlorperazine.
Cocaine-exposed infants have been found to have altered arousal responses but little is known about such responses in later childhood. Physiological responses to stressors were used to assess the arousal modulation of school-aged, cocaine-exposed children (n = 73) and two contrast groups, socioeconomically-matched controls (n = 58) and children with behavioral disturbance (n = 35). The behaviorally disturbed group had the highest heart rate across conditions but demonstrated a pattern of hyporesponsiveness to the stressors. They had the smallest decrement in skin conductance response at baseline and the least recovery of skin conductance response following exposure to stressors. Cocaine-exposed children demonstrated greater acceleratory responses to the stressors as indexed by their skin conductance level and were intermediate between the socioeconomically-matched controls and children with behavioral disturbance in recovery of skin conductance response following stressors. Altered arousal responses associated with prenatal cocaine exposure persisted into middle childhood but were different from those found in behaviorally disturbed children.
Oxidative stress leads to vascular damage and participates in the pathomechanisms of aortic dissection and aneurysm formation. Here we study aortic dissection in mice deficient in the superoxide-generating reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase NOX1. Seven days of treatment with the hypertensive agent angiotensin II (3 mg/kg per day) led to aortic dissection in 23% of wild-type C57BL/6J mice but in only 4% of NOX1-deficient mice (P=0.05). In contrast, treatment of wild-type C57BL/6J mice with the hypertensive agent norepinephrine (12 mg/kg per day), did not lead to aortic dissection or sudden death, suggesting that hypertension is not sufficient to cause aortic dissection. Interestingly, norepinephrine-dependent blood pressure elevations were conserved in NOX1-deficient mice, demonstrating that, different from angiotensin II, it acts through NOX1-independent hypertensive mechanisms. The resistance of NOX1-deficient mice to angiotensin II-induced aortic dissection suggests a role for NOX1-dependent alterations of the vascular wall. We, therefore, studied gene expression and protease/inhibitor equilibrium. cDNA array analysis demonstrated differential effects of angiotensin II on gene expression in wild-type and NOX1-deficient mice. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 was increased both on the mRNA and the protein level in aortas from NOX1-deficient mice. Thus, our results demonstrate that NOX1 is involved in the mechanisms of angiotensin II-dependent aortic dissection. As one underlying mechanism, we have identified NOX1-dependent suppression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 expression, which could lead to tissue damage through an altered protease/inhibitor balance.
Spontaneous left anterior descending coronary artery spasm occurred in two patients during coronary angiography. After intravenous injection of 0.75 mg of nitroglycerin, the narrowing was unchanged in one patient and only partially relieved in the other. The coronary narrowing completely disappeared after intracoronary injection of 1 mg of the active metabolite of molsidomine, linsidomine chlorhydrate (SIN-1). In the first patient, this injection was performed just prior to the initiation of coronary balloon dilatation, which was then cancelled. Although rare, these two observations demonstrate the limitations of the intravenous use of nitroglycerin during diagnostic coronary angiography and point out the efficacy of intracoronary administration of SIN-1.
Cardiotoxicity induced by arsenic trioxide has become a serious blockade of clinical applications of this effective anticancer agent. The general mechanism responsible for arsenic cardiotoxicity has been attributed to its induction of oxidative stress. Metallothionein (MT) has been extensively proven to be a potent endogenous antioxidant that protects heart against oxidative stress-induced cardiac damage. To investigate whether and how MT protects against arsenic cardiotoxicity, MT-overexpressing H9c2 (MT-H9c2) cardiac cells and transgenic (MT-TG) mice with their corresponding controls were exposed to the clinical relevant dose of arsenic trioxide. Cardiac cell apoptosis was detected by molecular indices, including the cleavage of caspase 3 and caspase 12, Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio, CHOP expression and/or confirmed by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. Arsenic trioxide dose- and time-dependently induced cardiac cell death in H9c2 cells with a significant activation of major MAPK subfamily members such as ERK1/2, JNK and p38, but not in MT-H9c2 cells. Importantly, the protective effect of MT on arsenic trioxide-induced apoptotic cell death was completely recaptured in the heart of MT-TG with a significant prevention of MAPKs activation. These results indicate that arsenic trioxide-upregulated MAPKs might play important role in arsenic trioxide-induced apoptotic cell death in cardiac cells both in vivo and in vitro, and MT's suppression of arsenic trioxide apoptotic effect was associated with the inhibition of MAPK activation. Therefore, selective elevation of cardiac MT levels with pharmacological approaches may be a potential strategy for the prevention of arsenic cardiotoxicity.
Two cases are reported in which depression was associated with the use of calcium channel blocker, nifedipine. In one instance, a patient became unresponsive to treatment with nortriptyline when nifedipine was introduced. In both cases, the depression resolved following discontinuation of nifedipine.
