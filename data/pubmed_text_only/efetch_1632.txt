Helenalin, a sesquiterpene lactone, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. Here, we investigated whether helenalin could induce apoptosis in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. Helenalin increased apoptosis in dose dependent manner in Caki cells, and also induced apoptosis in other carcinoma cells, such as human renal carcinoma ACHN cells, human colon carcinoma HT29 and HCT116 cells. We found that helenalin markedly induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes, such as regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD) 1, activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and/or the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). However, down-regulation of ATF4 and/or CHOP expression by siRNA had no effect on helenalin-induced apoptosis in Caki and HCT116 cells. Helenalin increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, ROS scavengers, N-acetylcystine (NAC), and glutathione ethyl ester (GEE), reduced helenalin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, helenalin induced apoptosis via ROS generation in human renal carcinoma Caki cells.
We herein report a case of new-onset epileptic seizures induced by carbamazepine in an individual with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We clinicians should bear in mind the possibility that epileptic seizures may possibly be either precipitated or exacerbated by carbamazepine especially in individuals with ASD.
Stimulants have been the mainstay of treatment for children with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, stimulants have been controversially purported to precipitate and exacerbate tics. Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine inhibitor, was introduced as a safe non-stimulant alternative treatment for ADHD children with comorbid tics or TS. We are presenting two children with ADHD, in which atomoxetine, at relatively low doses, exacerbated and precipitated tics. The diagnoses of ADHD and tic disorder were based on clinical observations and standardized rating scales. Case 1, an 8-year-old boy, had history of stimulant-induced tics. This child was placed on atomoxetine reported to be safe for patients with tics. This patient's tic control was adequate prior to atomoxetine treatment. However, while on atomoxetine, the patient promptly experienced tic exacerbation. Case 2, a 6-year-old boy, had no previous history of stimulant therapy and was receiving citalopram due to a comorbid anxiety disorder. Atomoxetine was initiated for the treatment of ADHD with improvement in the ADHD symptoms. But, upon a mild dose increase, the patient presented tic precipitation consisting primarily of neck twitches. Both cases experienced a decrease in tic activity when atomoxetine was discontinued, but tics did not fully resolve, causing psychosocial disturbance. Atypical neuroleptics were used with good results. Periodic assessments of the need for continued neuroleptic treatment were emphasized. These two children exemplify atomoxetine's potential to exacerbate and precipitate tics in children with ADHD. Independent controlled studies are needed to determine if atomoxetine should be used in children with ADHD and comorbid tic disorders or TS.
Phenytoin is a highly effective and widely prescribed anticonvulsant agent, but it can be associated with dose-related side effects and hypersensitivity reactions. We present a case of phenytoin-induced cholestatic hepatotoxicity in a 47-year-old woman who had exfoliative dermatitis, an increase in liver enzymes with a cholestatic pattern, and eosinophilia after 25 days of phenytoin therapy. The diagnostic workup showed no other possible causes, and the results of a percutaneous liver biopsy were consistent with drug-induced toxic hepatitis. Within 3 weeks after discontinuing phenytoin therapy, her liver function tests returned to normal values.
The mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) has been implicated in the protection of the mitochondrial matrix against lipid-induced mitochondrial damage. Recent evidence points toward mitochondrial aberrations as a major contributor to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes, and UCP3 is reduced in diabetes.
We compared skeletal muscle UCP3 protein levels in prediabetic subjects [i.e. impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)], diabetic patients, and healthy controls and examined whether rosiglitazone treatment was able to restore UCP3. PATIENTS, DESIGN, INTERVENTION: Ten middle-aged obese men with type 2 diabetes mellitus [age, 61.4 +/- 3.1 yr; body mass index (BMI), 29.8 +/- 2.9 kg/m(2)], nine IGT subjects (age, 59.0 +/- 6.6 yr; BMI, 29.7 +/- 3.0 kg/m(2)), and 10 age- and BMI-matched healthy controls (age, 57.3 +/- 7.4 yr; BMI, 30.1 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)) participated in this study. After baseline comparisons, diabetic patients received rosiglitazone (2 x 4 mg/d) for 8 wk.
Muscle biopsies were sampled to determine UCP3 and mitochondrial protein (complex I-V) content.
UCP3 protein content was significantly lower in prediabetic IGT subjects and in diabetic patients compared with healthy controls (39.0 +/- 28.5, 47.2 +/- 24.7, and 72.0 +/- 23.7 arbitrary units, respectively; P < 0.05), whereas the levels of the mitochondrial protein complex I-V were similar between groups. Rosiglitazone treatment for 8 wk significantly increased insulin sensitivity and muscle UCP3 content (from 53.2 +/- 29.9 to 66.3 +/- 30.9 arbitrary units; P < 0.05).
We show that UCP3 protein content is reduced in prediabetic subjects and type 2 diabetic patients. Eight weeks of rosiglitazone treatment restores skeletal muscle UCP3 protein in diabetic patients.
Methylmercury (MeHg) is a persistent environmental toxin that has targeted effects on fetal neural development. Although a number of cytotoxic mechanisms of MeHg have been characterized in cultured cells, its mode of action in the developing nervous system in vivo is less clear. Studies of MeHg-affected rodent and human brains show disrupted cortical and cerebellar architecture suggestive of mechanisms that augment cell signaling pathways potentially affecting cell migration and proliferation. We previously identified the Notch receptor pathway, a highly conserved signaling mechanism fundamental for neural development, as a target for MeHg-induced signaling in Drosophila neural cell lines. Here we have expanded our use of the Drosophila model to resolve a broader spectrum of transcriptional changes resulting from MeHg exposure in vivo and in vitro. Several Notch target genes within the Enhancer-of-split (E(spl)C) and Bearded (BrdC) complexes are upregulated with MeHg exposure in the embryo and in cultured neural cells. However, the profile of MeHg-induced E(spl)C and BrdC gene expression differs significantly from that seen with activation of the Notch receptor. Targeted knockdown of Notch and of the downstream coactivator Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), shows no effect on MeHg-induced transcription, indicating a novel Notch-independent mechanism of action for MeHg. MeHg transcriptional activation is partially mimicked by iodoacetamide but not by N-ethylmaleimide, two thiol-specific electrophiles, revealing a degree of specificity of cellular thiol targets in MeHg-induced transcriptional events.
Andersen-Tawil syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disease characterized by episodic muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features. Mutations in the KCNJ2 gene (which encodes an inward-rectifying potassium channel protein, Kir2.1) have been reported to be responsible for this disorder. Reported here is a novel de novo mutation in the KCNJ2 gene in a patient with Andersen-Tawil syndrome. This mutation predicts the substitution of alanine for glycine at position 146 (Gly146Ala, c.437G > C) of Kir2.1 and is located at the extracellular pore loop region that serves as a principal ion-selective filter. The patient did not respond to acetazolamide, but experienced an improvement of the paralytic symptoms on treatment with a combination of spironolactone, amiloride, and potassium supplements.
The alpha-adrenoceptor blocking properties of the two enantiomers of idazoxan have been investigated in rats, dogs and chicks, as well as their agonistic effects in pithed rats. At peripheral sites, (+) idazoxan was equipotent for blocking both postsynaptic alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors of the rat and revealed to be a potent antagonist at presynaptic sites of rats and dogs. (-) Idazoxan revealed to be selective for postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors with an apparent selectivity ratio of about 10. This selectivity of (-) idazoxan was greater in vitro. (-) Idazoxan also antagonized presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors of rats and dogs. At central sites, (+) and (-) idazoxan antagonized the hypotension, bradycardia, inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity induced by clonidine in rats and dogs and sedation induced by clonidine and azepexole in chicks. Although (+) idazoxan was more potent than (-) idazoxan, binding studies revealed (-) idazoxan to be more selective than (+) idazoxan at central sites. It is concluded that (+) idazoxan antagonizes both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors and (-) idazoxan is selective for alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In the pithed rat, only (-) idazoxan possesses both alpha-1 and alpha-2 agonistic effects. These results show little differences between the two enantiomers of idazoxan as for those of imidazoline derivatives.
We attempted to fully antagonize the extensive toxicity caused by NSAIDs (using diclofenac as a prototype).
Herein, we used the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, MW 1419), an anti-ulcer peptide shown to be efficient in inflammatory bowel disease clinical trials (PL 14736) and various wound treatments with no toxicity reported. This peptide was given to antagonize combined gastrointestinal, liver, and brain toxicity induced by diclofenac (12.5mg/kg intraperitoneally, once daily for 3 days) in rats.
Already considered a drug that can reverse the toxic side effects of NSAIDs, BPC 157 (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg) was strongly effective throughout the entire experiment when given (i) intraperitoneally immediately after diclofenac or (ii) per-orally in drinking water (0.16 μg/mL, 0.16 ng/mL). Without BPC 157 treatment, at 3h following the last diclofenac challenge, we encountered a complex deleterious circuit of diclofenac toxicity characterized by severe gastric, intestinal and liver lesions, increased bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) serum values, increased liver weight, prolonged sedation/unconsciousness (after any diclofenac challenge) and finally hepatic encephalopathy (brain edema particularly located in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, more in white than in gray matter, damaged red neurons, particularly in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar nuclei, Purkinje cells and less commonly in the hippocampal neurons).
The very extensive antagonization of diclofenac toxicity achieved with BPC 157 (μg-/ng-regimen, intraperitoneally, per-orally) may encourage its further use as a therapy to counteract diclofenac- and other NSAID-induced toxicity.
Parameters related to hepatic oxidative stress, cell injury, phagocytic activity, and liver histology were studied in control rats and in animals subjected to L-3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) and/or lindane administration. Hyperthyroidism elicited a calorigenic response and increased rates of hepatic O2 uptake, which were not modified by lindane treatment. T3 diminished serum lindane levels as well as those in the liver and adipose tissue, whereas lindane enhanced serum T3 levels in animals given T3. Compared with control rats, lindane significantly increased the rate of formation of thiobarbituric acid reactants (TBARS) by the liver, with no changes in either the reduced glutathione (GSH) content, the TBARS/GSH ratio as indicator of oxidative stress, or in the fractional rates of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and GSH efflux from perfused livers as integrity parameters. Hyperthyroidism induced GSH depletion in the liver, with a significant enhancement in the TBARS formation, the TBARS/GSH ratio, and in the fractional LDH and GSH efflux. These parameters were increased further by joint T3 and lindane administration in a magnitude exceeding the sum of the effects produced by the separate treatments. In addition, hyperthyroidism led to Kupffer cell hyperplasia and significant increases in serum glutamate oxalacetate transaminase (GOT) and in hepatic zymosan-induced chemiluminescence, while liver myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was found unchanged, compared with controls. Rats treated with lindane presented normal liver histology, with no changes in biochemical parameters related to cell injury. The joint administration of T3 and lindane, however, elicited a marked elevation in serum GOT and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), concomitantly with extensive liver necrosis and the presence of granulomas containing lymphocytes, Kupffer cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). In this condition, hepatic zymosan-induced light emission and MPO activity were enhanced over control values. It is concluded that hyperthyroidism increases the susceptibility of the liver to the toxic effects of lindane, which seems to be accomplished by potentiation of the hepatic oxidative stress status. The latter effect may be conditioned by an enhanced phagocytic respiratory burst activity due to the observed Kupffer cell hyperplasia and PMN infiltration, in addition to the increased production of reactive oxygen species in parenchymal cells.
Pulmonary hypertension developed in two women who had been taking fenfluramine for over eight months for weight reduction. On withdrawing the drug symptoms and electrocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension disappeared in both cases. In one patient, however, the evidence recurred after rechallenge with fenfluramine.These findings are strong evidence that fenfluramine may cause pulmonary hypertension. Hence any patient taking the drug should report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance.
Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is removal of myelin material from neural elements in a way that is not clearly known as yet. In this case of CPM, blindness was encountered and was thought to be "hysterical." The blindness went away after four months. After reviewing the literature we suggest the CPM was a complication of lithium toxicity which affected the lateral geniculate nucleus which produced blindness.
Quinocetone (QCT) and Cyadox (CYA) are important derivative of heterocyclic N-oxide quinoxaline (QdNO), used actively as antimicrobial feed additives in China. Here, we tested and compared the genotoxic potential of QCT and CYA with olaquindox (OLA) in Ames test, HGPRT gene mutation (HGM) test in V79 cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in human peripheral lymphocytes, chromosome aberration (CA) test, and micronucleus (MN) test in mice bone marrow. OLA was found genotoxic in all 5 assays. In Ames test, QCT produced His(+) mutants at 6.9 μg/plate in Salmonella typhimurium TA 97, at 18.2 μg/plate in TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and at 50 μg/plate in TA 98. CYA produced His(+) mutants at 18.2 μg/plate in TA 97, TA 1535, and at 50 μg/plate in TA 98, TA 100 and TA 1537. QCT was found positive in HGM and UDS assay at concentrations ≥10 μg/ml while negative results were reported in CA test and MN test. Collectively, we found that OLA was more genotoxic than QCT and CYA. Genotoxicity of QCT was found at higher concentration levels in Ames test, HGM and UDS assays while CYA showed weak mutagenic potential to bacterial cells in Ames test.
Here, we isolated isorhamnetin, a natural 3'-O-methylated flavonoid, from water dropwort (Oenanthe javanica, Umbelliferae) and investigated its ability to protect against acute inflammation in vivo and in vitro. To induce paw swelling, the hind paw of each rat was injected with a carrageenan 1h after vehicle or isorhamnetin treatment. In vitro effect and mechanism studies were performed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. Administration of isorhamnetin markedly inhibited the swelling volume and the thickness of hind paws. Moreover, isorhamnetin significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory gene expression in rats. Isorhamnetin pretreatment inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and NO release in LPS-stimulated cells. Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and activating protein-1 (AP-1) is the key step in the iNOS gene induction. Isorhamnetin specifically inhibited NF-κB luciferase activity, but not AP-1. Pretreatment with isorhamnetin suppressed NF-κB nuclear translocation in accordance with decreased phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory-κB. Consistently, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 expression, representative NF-κB target genes, were almost completely prohibited by isorhamnetin. Furthermore, isorhamnetin inhibited LPS-induced JNK and AKT/IKKα/β phosphorylation. Our results suggest that isorhamnetin inhibited JNK, and AKT/IKKα/β activation, leading to NF-κB inactivation, which might contribute to the inhibition of the acute inflammatory response.
Studies assessing withdrawal phenomenon during short-term abstinence from chronic cocaine use have been limited. Although cocaine abusers are reported to be at increased risk for cardiac disorders, little research has assessed cardiac parameters in cocaine abusers and subsequent changes in these parameters that may be associated with the discontinuation of cocaine use. In this study, we categorize 441 chronic cocaine abusers into three groups based on self-reported length of abstinence from cocaine use at entry into a trial approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) assessing the use of pergolide mesylate in treating relapse and craving in crack cocaine abuse. Electrocardiogram (ECG) PR intervals were found to be correlated positively with length of abstinence, returning to normal population levels within 30 days. In addition, levels of generalized anxiety, nervousness, and heart racing were found to be correlated negatively with length of abstinence from crack cocaine. This work provides preliminary evidence of cardiac and mood-related parameters that are associated with cocaine abstinence and that may indicate specific withdrawal phenomena in chronic users. In addition, these results suggest that the risk of cardiomyopathies associated with abnormal atrial-ventricular polarization may dissipate relatively quickly in abusing individuals.
2 patients having alpha-methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia were followed sequentially using an in vitro assay of autologous monocyte-macrophage activity to determine if their reticuloendothelial system (RES) function was abnormal and thus could be related to the mechanism of lysis. RES function was evaluated while the patients were actively hemolyzing and during remission, following discontinuance of the drug. The results indicated that RES activity is normal in patients having hemolytic anemia due to alpha-methyldopa administration. Also, following cessation of drug therapy, the patients' IgG-coated red cells interacted significantly for a prolonged period (4-5 months) with autologous or normal allogeneic monocyte-macrophages. This was associated with a concurrent reticulocytosis and indicates a persistent low-level hemolytic phase throughout this period, even though hemoglobin and hematocrit values remained within the normal ranges. Although levels of IgG sensitizing the patients' red cells were essentially constant during the hemolytic phase and when the patients were in complete remission, significant monocyte-macrophage activity was only evident during the hemolytic period. In an attempt to explain this phenomenon, it is postulated that hemolysis in patients receiving alpha-methyldopa is related to the interaction of drug with red cell membrane proteins which results in a variably expressed 'altered' antigen which is recognized by 'autoantibody'. The proper expression of the Fc portion of the immunoglobin molecule to result in specific recognition by receptors on monocyte-macrophages depends upon the extent of the antigen alteration by alpha-methyldopa. If the drug does not result in appropriate antigen alteration, then, although 'autoantibody' may still bind to the red blood cell, its Fc region is not readily recognized by monocyte-macrophages and little or no erythrophagocytosis occurs.
Agmatine is an endogenous amine derived from arginine that potentiates morphine analgesia and blocks symptoms of naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal in rats. In this study, we sought to determine whether treatment with agmatine during the development of morphine dependence inhibits the withdrawal symptoms and that the effect is mediated by cAMP system. Exposure of rats to morphine for 7 days resulted in marked naloxone-induced withdrawal symptoms and agmatine treatment along with morphine significantly decreasing the withdrawal symptoms. The levels of cAMP were markedly increased in morphine-treated rat brain slices when incubated with naloxone and this increase was significantly reduced in rats treated with morphine and agmatine. The induction of tyrosine hydroxylase after morphine exposure was also reduced in locus coeruleus when agmatine was administered along with morphine. We conclude that agmatine reduces the development of dependence to morphine and that this effect is probably mediated by the inhibition of cAMP signaling pathway during chronic morphine exposure.
Encephalopathy or neurotoxicity can occur with cefepime use in patients with impaired or relatively normal renal function. However, few articles have examined the relationship between cefepime's adverse effects and peritoneal dialysis. Here, we report the case of an 80-year-old woman with chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis that developed agitation, confusion, and dystonia after cefepime administration for 2 days. The clinical and electroencephalographic abnormalities improved after discontinuation the drug. We review the role of peritoneal dialysis in the development of cefepime-induced encephalopathy. Peritoneal dialysis is a less efficient way to eliminate cefepime than hemodialysis. Short-term hemodialysis might be considered to facilitate elimination of the drug in patients who have developed neurotoxicity.
The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) plays pivotal roles in coagulation and inflammation, however, its activity is markedly changed by ectodomain cleavage and release as the soluble protein (sEPCR). According to previous studies, there are approximately 100ng/ml sEPCR in human plasma and the levels increase in inflammatory diseases. EPCR can be shed from the cell surface, and this is mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE). We recently reported on the anti-inflammatory and barrier protective activities of rosmarinic acid (RA), an important component of the leaves of Perilla frutescens. However, little is known about the effects of RA on EPCR shedding. Here, we investigated this issue by monitoring the effects of RA on phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-1β, and on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-mediated EPCR shedding and underlying mechanisms. Data showed that treatment with RA resulted in potent inhibition of PMA, TNF-α, IL-induced EPCR shedding by suppression of TACE expression. In addition, RA reduced PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of p38, extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggest the potential for use of RA as an anti-sEPCR shedding reagent against PMA, TNF-α, IL-1β and CLP-mediated EPCR shedding.
Retinol and its metabolite retinoic acid play a critical role in immunity, reproduction, and development. Retinoids are known to influence renal development, and show beneficial effects in experimental models of renal disease. beta-Carotene (provitamin A) is cleaved to retinal by beta-carotene 15,15'- monooxygenase (BCM), which is an essential enzyme for retinoid biosynthesis. However, the metabolism of retinol and beta-carotene in renal diseases such as nephrosis remains unclear. We studied BCM gene expression and retinol status in rats with nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). BCM gene expression in the liver and intestines of PAN-treated rats was decreased compared with that in controls, while the expression in the kidney of PAN-treated animals was increased. Plasma retinol and retinol-binding protein levels were decreased in PAN-treated rats, but hepatic retinol level did not differ between PAN-treated and control rats. Up-regulation of BCM gene expression in the kidneys of rats with nephrotic syndrome may result in increased conversion of beta-carotene to retinal, so this change might supply more retinoic acid to the damaged glomeruli. Changes in the metabolism of retinol and beta-carotene might have an important role in protection against the development of nephrosis.
Interleukin (IL)-13 induces bronchopulmonary hyperreactivity (BHR), eosinophilic inflammation, and mucus accumulation in the murine airways. To investigate the potential role of leukotrienes (LT) in mediating these effects, we studied the ability of IL-13 to induce the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), we compared the effects of IL-13 and of various leukotrienes on different biological parameters and the interference by the 5-LO inhibitor zileuton (orally, 50 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 3 days), and by some antagonists. The cysteinyl (Cys)-LTs LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and LTB4, (1 microg/d for 3 d, instilled intratracheally) induced BHR, cell recruitment, fibroblast growth, and mucus production and release into the airways. After the intratracheal instillation of recombinant murine (rm) IL-13, Cys-LT increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at 15 min, followed by lower amounts at 3-6 h. Zileuton inhibited LT production in the BALF, eosinophil and neutrophil sequestration in the lungs, and their passage into the BALF. Zileuton and the Cys-LT-receptor antagonist (ra) LY171883 or MK-571, or the LTB4-ra PH-163 (at 3-10, 5-15, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, administered intratracheally), inhibited BHR by recombinant murine IL-13. Airways mucus after recombinant murine IL-13-challenge was reduced by zileuton and by LY171883, MK-571, and PH-163. LT also induced the vascular endothelium remodelling and collagen deposition. Overall, our results demonstrate the major involvement of LT in the effects of IL-13 on the lung.
Phenanthrene (PHE) is one of the most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the aquatic environment. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of PHE at environmentally relevant concentrations on testicular development in male Sebastiscus marmoratus. After 50 days exposure, the gonadosomatic indices and percentage of sperm produced showed a U-shaped dose response. The levels of salmon-type gonadotropin releasing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone mRNA, 17β-estradiol, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity all showed a U-shaped dose response, which clearly demonstrated the U-shaped effects of PHE exposure on spermatogenesis and also elucidated the action pathway. This result would bring a difficulty and a challenge to any risk assessment of PHE exposure to the reproductive health of fishes. Thus far, there has been no ready explanation for a U-shaped dose-response curve, which is well recognized as a hormetic phenomenon for many hormones, drugs, and toxic compounds. In the present study, PHE accumulation in the brain showed an inverse U-shaped increase compared to the control. Glutathione S-transferase activity in the brain showed a U-shaped dose-response, which was related with the PHE accumulation. These results have given a reasonable explanation for the U-shaped dose-response via alteration of biotransformation enzyme activity in the brain.
The second most common of all structural birth defects, neural tube defects (NTDs), affect approximately 2.6/1,000 births worldwide, and 1/1,000 births in the United States. Of the many environmental agents suspected of being teratogenic, arsenic (As) is capable of inducing NTDs in laboratory animals.
We evaluated the teratogenicity of oral exposure on embryonic day (E) 7.5 and E:8.5 to As 4.8, 9.6, or 14.4 mg/kg (as sodium arsenate) in an inbred mouse strain, LM/Bc/Fnn, that does not exhibit spontaneous neural tube malformations. Control and arsenic-treated dams (20 per treatment group) were weighed daily, and evaluated for signs of maternal toxicity. Fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal malformations.
There was no maternal toxicity as evidenced by losses in maternal body weight following As treatment. However, liver weights were lower in all As-treated groups, suggesting hepatotoxicity due to As exposure. The number of litters affected with an NTD (exencephaly) in each treatment group was: 0, 1, 5, and 9 for control, As 4.8, 9.6, or 14.4, respectively, which exhibited a positive linear trend. There was evidence for trends between As dose and the number of litters displaying vertebral (p<0.001) and calvarial (p<0.01) abnormalities, components of the axial skeleton. Mean fetal weight of all As-treated groups was significantly less than in control.
In our model, maternal oral treatment with As induced NTDs. It also significantly increased the frequency of axial skeletal anomalies in the offspring exposed in utero, and reduced mean fetal weight, without evidence of maternal toxicity.
Although the widespread introduction of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists into the management of congestive heart failure (CHF) has led to significant improvements in morbidity and mortality, it is also apparent that clinical responses to this therapy vary substantially. With the recognition that functionally significant genetic polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenoceptor exist with clinically relevant allelic frequency, we hypothesized that beta2-adrenoceptor genotype may affect the response to carvedilol. The clinical response, influence on left ventricular function and beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) genotype was determined in 80 patients treated with carvedilol. A clinically significant improvement in left ventricular function (good responder) was defined as an absolute improvement of 10% in the left ventricular ejection fraction or 5% in the fractional shortening. Consistent with studies performed in vitro on the influence of beta2AR genotype and receptor desensitization, subjects who were homozygous for the allele encoding the Gln27 polymorphism displayed a significantly lower proportion of good responders than patients who were homozygous or heterozygous for the Glu27 polymorphism (26% versus 63%, P=0.003). These data demonstrate a significant influence of beta2AR genotype in the response to carvedilol in CHF patients. Accordingly, determination of beta2AR status may be of value in the tailoring of individual therapy in patients with CHF.
We sought to determine if maternal bupropion treatment in early pregnancy is associated with congenital heart defects in the infant.
We conducted a retrospective case-control study of birth defects risk factors. Data on 6853 infants with major heart defects were compared with 5869 control infants born in 1997-2004. Bupropion exposure was defined as any reported use between 1 month before and 3 months after conception.
Mothers of infants with left outflow tract heart defects were more likely to have reported taking bupropion than mothers of control infants (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.7; P = .01).
We identified a positive association between early pregnancy bupropion use and left outflow tract heart defects; however, the magnitude of the observed increased risk was small. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm these results.
