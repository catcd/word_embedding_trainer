We have studied the influence of therapeutic plasma concentrations of theophylline on some of the unwanted responses to intravenous terbutaline in normal subjects. There was a significantly greater fall in serum potassium and rise in plasma glucose, pulse rate and systolic blood pressure in response to an intravenous infusion of terbutaline when theophylline was present compared with when terbutaline was given alone. These drugs are commonly used together in the treatment of acute asthma and potentiation of side effects may be hazardous. We suggest monitoring of the serum potassium when these drugs are used together during acute exacerbations of asthma.
Scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy (SPSMA) and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type IIC (HMSN IIC, also known as HMSN2C or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2C (CMT2C)) are phenotypically heterogeneous disorders involving topographically distinct nerves and muscles. We originally described a large New England family of French-Canadian origin with SPSMA and an American family of English and Scottish descent with CMT2C. We mapped SPSMA and CMT2C risk loci to 12q24.1-q24.31 with an overlapping region between the two diseases. Further analysis reduced the CMT2C risk locus to a 4-Mb region. Here we report that SPSMA and CMT2C are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4 (TRPV4). Functional analysis revealed that increased calcium channel activity is a distinct property of both SPSMA- and CMT2C-causing mutant proteins. Our findings link mutations in TRPV4 to altered calcium homeostasis and peripheral neuropathies, implying a pathogenic mechanism and possible options for therapy for these disorders.
A patient with ankylosing spondylitis, after demonstrating incomplete clinical response to adalimumab, received three monthly infusions of pamidronate along with continuing TNF-alpha blockade. Complete disappearance of the back pain was reported after the second pamidronate infusion. The perspectives of the combination therapy with TNF-alpha inhibitor and pamidronate are discussed.
Spinal muscular atrophies (SMA, also known as hereditary motor neuropathies) and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Here we report that mutations in the TRPV4 gene cause congenital distal SMA, scapuloperoneal SMA, HMSN 2C. We identified three missense substitutions (R269H, R315W and R316C) affecting the intracellular N-terminal ankyrin domain of the TRPV4 ion channel in five families. Expression of mutant TRPV4 constructs in cells from the HeLa line revealed diminished surface localization of mutant proteins. In addition, TRPV4-regulated Ca(2+) influx was substantially reduced even after stimulation with 4alphaPDD, a TRPV4 channel-specific agonist, and with hypo-osmotic solution. In summary, we describe a new hereditary channelopathy caused by mutations in TRPV4 and present evidence that the resulting substitutions in the N-terminal ankyrin domain affect channel maturation, leading to reduced surface expression of functional TRPV4 channels.
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key innate immunity receptor that initiates an inflammatory response primarily against Gram-negative bacteria. Two recent publications reported that variants in TLR4 were associated with risk of prostate cancer. To further investigate the role of TLR4 in prostate cancer susceptibility, we identified six tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms that comprehensively captured the common genetic variation of the locus and tested these polymorphisms in our case-control study of 1,012 men. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed nominally statistically significant associations with prostate cancer risk, with the strongest (rs10759932) associated with a 4-fold increased risk of disease (P = 0.006). We estimated through permutation analysis that a similarly strong result would occur by chance 2.5% of the time. Our findings support previous studies and suggest that inherited differences in TLR4 influence prostate cancer risk.
Carbon disulfide (CS2) intoxication may induce peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, and cardiovascular diseases. In our studies, abnormalities of the peripheral nerves including clinical symptoms and electrophysiological findings were still present 3 years after cessation of CS2 exposure. The data indicate that CS2 neuropathy may persist for a period of time. The involvement of central nervous system may continue even longer. Brain magnetic resonance images usually show multiple high signal intensities in the basal ganglia and subcortical white matter suggesting a vascular event particularly in the small vessels. In addition, a patient with diffuse demyelination in the cerebral hemispheres also showed a diffuse decrease of regional cerebral blood flow indicating a microangiopathy. Therefore, CS2 exposure should be considered as a risk factor for strokes and one of the causes for diffuse leucoencephalopathy. Because CS2 may induce parkinsonian features, a differential diagnosis between CS2 parkinsonism and idiopathic parkinsonism is important. In our study, dopamine transporter with 99mTc-TRODAT-1 brain single photon emission computed tomography showed a normal uptake in the corpus striatum. The data suggest a normal presynaptic dopaminergic pathway function and provide useful information in differentiation. The involvement of cardiovascular systems may be due to thrombotic effects rather than atherogenic effects. In addition, absorption of CS2 through skin is also significant particularly in workers with skin lesions.
A common drawback of propofol is pain on injection and lidocaine is commonly mixed with propofol to reduce its incidence and severity. We conducted a randomised, prospective, double-blind study to compare injection pain following the administration of two different formulations of propofol in 200 unpremedicated ASA I-III adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia. Patients were allocated randomly into two groups to receive either Propofol-Lipuro without added lidocaine or Diprivan mixed with lidocaine 10 mg. Five ml of the study solution was injected at a constant rate over 15 s and patients graded any associated pain or discomfort using a four-point verbal rating scale. The incidence of propofol injection pain was virtually identical in both study groups with 37/98 (38%) patients experiencing pain or discomfort following Propofol-Lipuro compared with 35/98 (36%) after Diprivan (p = 0.88). We observed no significant difference in pain scores between the groups (p = 0.67). Moderate or severe injection pain was experienced by 12/98 (12%) patients given Propofol-Lipuro compared with 8/98 (8%) given Diprivan (p = 0.48).
Nitric oxide (NO) is hypothesized to be a novel intracellular messenger in the central nervous system. Recently, NO involvement in learning and memory processes has been proposed. Compounds that inhibit nitric oxide synthase, the key synthesizing enzyme, may block cognition, while NO donors may facilitate it. The aim of this study was to assess in the rat the effects of the NO donor molsidomine (2 and 4 mg/kg, i.p.) on memory deficits caused by scopolamine. For this purpose, the object recognition task and the step-through passive avoidance procedure were chosen. In addition, the effects of molsidomine in antagonizing the scopolamine-induced hypermotility were also examined. Scopolamine at 0.2 mg/kg (object recognition) and 0.75 mg/kg (passive avoidance) disrupted acquisition in both the tasks and induced locomotor hyperactivity at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Molsidomine at either dose reversed the scopolamine-induced deficits in the object recognition paradigm but did not counteract the hypermotility and the deficits occurred in the passive avoidance test. These results suggest that to some extent, the NO donor molsidomine is involved in memory processing.
Even though uncommon in pregnancy, aortic dissection is a potentially catastrophic vascular complication, occurring mainly in the late stages of pregnancy. Vascular events, including aortic dissection are recognized complications of crack-cocaine use. The authors report a case of aortic dissection in early pregnancy related to crack-cocaine use. They believe that the combined effects of pregnancy and crack cocaine on the vasculature create the requisite milieu potentiating such catastrophic events as aortic dissection. This paper reviews the possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and the available diagnostic, therapeutic, and management options.
Rats were given either the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, alpha-methyltyrosine (alphaMT), in doses of 10 or 250 mg/kg or the neuroleptic, haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg). Other rats received both drugs (haloperidol 30 min after alphaMT). This dose of haloperidol alone caused only a slight, gradually developing catalepsy, while alphaMT alone caused none. The combination quickly caused a strong catalepsy. Striatal dopamine (DA) stores were only minimally depleted at the time of catalepsy potentiation. Th e marked elevation of striatal homovanilluc acid concentration seen after haloperidol administration was greatly inhibited by alphaMT pretreatment. It is concluded that the marked potentiation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy by alpha MT is related to the absence of newly synthesized DA rather than to an exhausted main DA pool and that newly synthesized DA has a greater role in striatal function than does DA of the main striatal storage pool.
The protective effect of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), an antiulcer drug, against the acute toxicity and teratogenicity produced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was examined in C57BL/6J mice. When mice were co-treated, GGA reduced the loss of body weight gain and lethality produced by TCDD but hepatomegaly and thymic atrophy were not improved. Additionally, no protective effect of GGA was observed in the formation of cleft palate and hydronephrosis in mouse fetuses caused by maternal exposure to TCDD. To clarify the reducing mechanism by GGA, the Hsp70.1 mRNA levels in liver and intestine were analyzed. However, it was difficult to explain the effect of GGA from the induction of Hsp70.1. GGA had also no effect on the induction of hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity by TCDD. These data suggest that GGA exhibits a protective effect against some forms of dioxin toxicity by a mechanism without involving inhibition of arylhydrocarbon receptor activation.
1. Twenty-two patients hospitalized for treatment of depression were treated under conditions simulating those of home treatment. 2. Full doses of nortriptyline, from 100 to 150 mg/day, were started after baseline observations were made. 3. Two patients were dropped from the study, one for orthostatic hypotension, one for an aberrant response to nortriptyline. Two additional patients developed orthostasis which was easily managed. Otherwise no unusual side effects were noted. 4. After six days of treatment, 9 of 20 patients showed significant improvement with an overall reduction in scores on the Hamilton Depression Scale of 49% for the entire group. 5. Using the weight-adjusted dosage schedule, 18 of the 21 patients attained plasma concentrations of nortriptyline within the presumed therapeutic range; however, no clear relationship could be established between plasma concentrations and clinical response. 6. With proper selection of patients, it should be possible to treat at home some patients who currently are considered to require hospitalization.
In this study the effect of epomediol (1,3,3-trimethyl-2-oxabicyclo 2.2.2 ocatan-6,7-endo, endo-diol) (Clesidren) on rat hepatocyte bile acid transport was evaluated using [3H]-taurocholate as a probe, in order to clarify the mechanism of action of this drug. To this purpose, primary cultures were prepared with hepatocytes obtained from normal rats (Group I), and rats receiving a 4-day treatment with either epomediol (100 mg/kg) (Group II), or ethinyloestradiol (5 mg/kg) (Group III), or ethinyloestradiol plus epomediol (5 mg and 100 mg/kg respectively) (Group IV) or vehicle DMSO 50 microliters/kg) (Group V). All hepatocytes were isolated 10 days after the end of treatment. Hepatocyte [3H]-taurocholate uptake was evaluated in vitro after 48 hr of incubation in the presence or absence of epomediol. In both cases no difference was found when evaluating the uptake of hepatocytes from Group I, II and V. In the absence of epomediol [3H]-taurocholate uptake in hepatocytes from rats of Group IV was significantly higher than that observed in hepatocytes from rats of Group III. On the other hand, the presence of epomediol did not influence [3H]-taurocholate uptake in hepatocytes from rats of Group III, which remained significantly lower compared to that of control hepatocytes (Group V). The protective effect obtained when administering epomediol simultaneously with ethinyloestradiol (Group IV) was not due to its ability to compete with ethynyloestradiol for the binding to oestrogen receptors. Our results indicate that epomediol is able to restore a normal hepatocyte bile acid uptake when given in vivo simultaneously with ethinyloestradiol but does not influence bile acid transport in cultured hepatocytes. Further studies are required to better define the choleretic activity of this drug.
Aminophylline-induced seizures were studied in 166 male albino rats in five age groups--7, 12, 18, 25 and 90 days old. Aminophylline injected in doses from 150-350 mg/kg i.p. elicited both minimal, clonic and major, i.e. generalized tonic-clonic seizures during the 60-min observation period. The pattern of minimal seizures did not change during development; major seizures exhibited changes in proportion to their three phases--running, tonic and clonic phases. Dependence on the dose of aminophylline was observed in the incidence of major seizures as well as in shortening of latencies of both types of seizures. More marked convulsant effects of aminophylline in 7-, 12- and 18-day-old rat pups than in older animals might be due to pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic factors.
The presented case concerns a 77-year old man who had been chronically taking colchicine for treatment of gout. He was admitted because of a transient ischemic cerebrovascular attack with motor aphasia and complained of preexisting paraesthesias in the lower extremities. Neurological examination revealed a global muscular weakness, absent myotatic reflexes and a diminished sensation. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were increased and electromyography showed spontaneous fibrillations in deltoid muscles, positive spikewaves in deltoids and anterior tibial muscles. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were mildly reduced. Nerve biopsy findings were compatible with a chronic axonal neuropathy having produced a significant loss of myelinated axons and also denervation features of unmyelinated axons. In muscle, combined neurogenic and myogenic features were found. The former result from the axonal neuropathy. The latter were mainly characterized by focal myofibrillar disorganisation and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in muscle fibres. The presented neuromuscular symptoms and signs, the increased CK values, the electromyographic and nerve conduction velocity findings as well as nerve and muscle biopsy observations, are consistent with the diagnosis of colchicine-induced myopathy and neuropathy. Furthermore, the disappearance of paraesthesias, normalisation of CK values, and disappearance of fibrillations and positive spike waves in deltoid and anterior tibial muscles on electromyography, after stopping of the colchicine therapy, supported the diagnosis.
We evaluated diurnal weight gain and polyuria among 31 institutionalized chronically psychotic patients receiving lithium and 42 controls not receiving this drug. The patients were weighed weekly for three weeks at 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. We normalized the diurnal weight gain (NDWG) as a percentage by subtracting the 7 a.m. weight from the 4 p.m. weight, multiplying the difference by 100, and then dividing the result by the 7 a.m. weight. Polyuria was assessed using mean urine creatinine concentration (MUCR). NDWG was abnormal among study patients (1.9 +/- 1.2%) and controls (1.6 +/- 1.5%) independent of lithium treatment. The variation in MUCR explained about 20% of the variation in NDWG in both groups.
The effects of continuous intrarenal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) infusion (7 days) on sodium and water balance, plasma renin activity (PRA), and sodium and water balance, plasma renin activity (PRA), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were examined in conscious, unilaterally nephrectomized dogs maintained on a fixed sodium intake of 55 meq/day. PGE2 infusion (2 microgram/min) resulted in a sustained threefold increase in both urine output and water intake without a measurable change in glomerular filtration rate. PRA increased from 0.4 +/- 0.1 during the control period to 2.2 +/- 0.9 ng AI.ml-1.h-1 on day 1 and averaged 3.6 +/- 0.5 for the remaining 6 days of PGE2 infusion. Concurrently, MAP increased from 102 +/- 3 to a maximum of 117 +/- 4 mmHg on day 5; changes in PRA and MAP were significantly correlated (r = 0.96, P less than 0.001). Sodium excretion increased from 54.5 +/- 3 to 88.0 +/- 19 meq/day on day 1, and then declined to an average of 64.8 +/- 1 meq/day for the remaining 6 days of infusion. All variables returned to the control level during the recovery period. Intravenous infusion of PGE2 (2 microgram/min) yielded directionally similar but statistically insignificant effects. It is concluded that chronic intrarenal PGE2 infusion results in marked diuresis, polydipsia, a moderate loss of sodium, enhanced PRA, and mild hypertension.
The present study was designed to examine whether long-term blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with perindopril ameliorates dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Twelve patients with proven CAD were randomly divided in two groups; one group received perindopril (8 mg/day, p.o.) for 3 months and another group served as a control. To evaluate anti-ischemic effects of perindopril, dobutamine stress echocardiography was performed before and 3 months after the treatment in a double-blind manner. Long-term treatment with perindopril significantly ameliorated the dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, as evaluated by time to the onset of symptoms, magnitude of electrocardiographic ST-segment changes, and left ventricular wall motion score (all P<0.05). The treatment significantly decreased serum ACE activities (P<0.01) and increased plasma bradykinin concentrations (P<0.05). The extent of reduction of left ventricular wall motion score by perindopril was closely correlated with that of inhibition of serum ACE activities (P<0.01) and with that of increase in plasma bradykinin concentrations (P<0.05). By contrast, no such beneficial changes were noted in the control group. These results provide the first evidence that long-term treatment with perindopril exerts anti-ischemic effects on the myocardial ischemia induced by increased myocardial oxygen demand in patients with CAD.
Treatment of plantar warts is often difficult and may be painful, often employing destructive treatment modalities. We report the successful treatment of a patient with a large plantar wart using Imiquimod 5% cream under occlusion with a 40% salicylic acid pad. This combination treatment modality likely allows successful delivery of Imiquimod through the thick skin on the plantar surface. Once penetrated, an anti-viral state is created by upregulating specific cytokines to eradicate the human papilloma virus (HPV).
The normal expression of Ca2+-handling protein is critical for efficient myocardial function. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that beta-blocker treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodeling and cardiac contractile dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca2+-handling protein
We investigated the change of LV remodeling and function in a rat model of heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without carvedilol (30 mg/kg/d) or metoprolol (60 mg/kg/d) treatment for 6 weeks (n = 9 in the MI plus carvedilol group, and n = 8 in every other group). The expression of messenger RNA and proteins of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA) and phospholamban in cardiomyocytes of all rats were also measured
There was significant LV remodeling and cardiac contractile dysfunction in MI rats. The messenger RNA and protein expression of SERCA were down-regulated (p < 0.01), but the expression of phospholamban messenger RNA and protein were up-regulated (p < 0.01) in MI rats compared to sham-operated rats. After the treatment with beta-blockers, LV remodeling and function were clearly improved. Carvedilol was better in attenuating the weight of the LV and the relative weight of the right ventricle than metoprolol (p < 0.05). beta-Blockers restored the low expression of SERCA (p < 0.05) but showed no effect on phospholamban expression (p > 0.05). Moreover, carvedilol induced a more significant improvement of SERCA expression than metoprolol (p < 0.05)
Beta-blockers are effective in preventing LV remodeling and cardiac contractile dysfunction in the failing heart. The molecular mechanism may be related to normalization of SERCA expression.
Sulfasalazine and mesalazine (also known as mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid) preparations have for many years been used for the treatment of IBD (i.e. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), for both active disease and the control of remission. It has also been suggested that mesalazine is a chemoprophylactic agent that protects against the development of colorectal cancer. This Review focuses on the latest clinical evidence for the use of these aminosalicylates for the treatment of IBD, and concludes that sulfasalazine and mesalazine are useful for the treatment of both active and quiescent ulcerative colitis, whereas they have no clinical effect on either active or inactive Crohn's disease. Furthermore, evidence is lacking that mesalazine per se is a chemoprophylactic agent.
In the present study, using hydrophilic adenosine antagonists either selective to A1 or A2 receptors, we investigated the central and spinal adenosinergic participation in fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with ketamine and were under mechanical ventilation. Fentanyl (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) consistently elicited electromyographic (EMG) activation in the sacrococcygeal dorsalis lateralis muscle. This implied muscular rigidity was not blocked by i.c.v. administration of the adenosine A1 antagonist, 1-allyl-3,7-dimethyl-8-p-sulfophenyl-xanthine (ADSPX; 20 or 40 nmol/2.5 microliters), except at higher dose (80 nmol). Equimolar doses of the adenosine A2 antagonist, 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthane (DMPX), did not exert any inhibitory effect on fentanyl-induced rigidity. Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the same doses of ADSPX (20, 40 or 80 nmol/10 microliters) appreciably suppressed the EMG activation. However, the rigidity was only inhibited by 40 or 80 nmol (i.t.) of DMPX, but not by the lowest dose. High-dose (80 nmol, i.t.) adenosine A1 or A2 antagonist per se did not induce motor impairment or hindlimb paralysis in conscious animals. These results suggest that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors in the spinal cord may play a more crucial role than those in the central nervous system (CNS) in fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity in rats.
The frequency of post-suxamethonium pain after pretreatment with small doses of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents was studied in 299 patients. Gallamine 10 and 20 mg, tubocurarine 5 mg and pancuronium 1 mg were equally effective when a 2-min interval was allowed between their injection and suxamethonium administration. Fazadinium was ineffective and caused difficulty with intubation. No evidence supporting the concept that dosage should be related to patient's weight was found. Inpatients suffered from post-suxamethonium pain as much as did outpatients.
