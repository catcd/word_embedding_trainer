While cocaine's interaction with the dopamine (DA) transporter and subsequent increase in DA transmission are usually considered key factors responsible for its locomotor stimulatory and reinforcing properties, many centrally mediated physiological and psychoemotional effects of cocaine are resistant to DA receptor blockade, suggesting the importance of other non-DA mechanisms. To explore the role of cocaine's interaction with Na+ channels, rats were used to compare locomotor stimulatory and temperature (NAcc, temporal muscle and skin) effects of repeated iv injections of cocaine (1 mg/kg) with those induced by procaine (PRO 5 mg/kg), a short-acting local anesthetic with negligible effect on the DA transporter, and cocaine methiodide (COC-MET 1.31 mg/kg), a quaternary cocaine derivative that is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. While PRO, unlike cocaine, did not induce locomotor activation, it mimicked cocaine in its ability to increase brain temperature following the initial injection and to induce biphasic, down-up fluctuations following repeated injections. This similarity suggests that both these effects of cocaine may be driven by its action on Na+ channels, a common action of both drugs. While COC-MET also did not affect locomotor activity, it shared with cocaine and PRO their ability to increase brain temperature but failed to induce temperature decreases after repeated injections. These findings point toward activation of peripheral Na+ channels as the primary mechanism of rapid excitatory effects of cocaine and inhibition of centrally located Na+ channels as the primary mechanism for transient inhibitory effects of cocaine. DA receptor blockade (SCH23390+eticlopride) fully eliminated locomotor stimulatory and temperature-increasing effects of cocaine, but its temperature-decreasing effects remained intact. Surprisingly, DA receptor blockade also altered the temperature fluctuations caused by PRO and COC-MET, suggesting that some of the central effects triggered via Na+ channels are in fact DA-dependent. Finally, repeated administration of PRO to animals that had previous cocaine experience led to conditioned locomotion and potentiated temperature-increasing effects of this drug. It appears, therefore, that, in addition to the central effects of cocaine mediated via interaction with the DA transporter and potentiation of DA uptake, interaction with peripheral and central Na+ channels is important for the initial physiological and, perhaps, affective effects of cocaine, likely contributing to the unique abuse potential of this drug.
Recent studies have reported that tetracycline may induce chronic inflammatory responses in the adjacent soft tissues. The purpose of the present study was to determine if dry, powdered tetracycline evoked an inflammatory response in nerve tissue.
Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and bilateral mental nerves were exposed. Half of the 40 nerves were intentionally injured by removing the epineurium, and the remaining nerves were uninjured. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind manner, equal volumes of color-matched, precoded tetracycline powder or Gelfoam (Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) powder control was placed in intimate contact with the nerves and sealed in polyethylene tubes. Forty-five days later the animals were killed and 5-micron sections of the nerves were prepared for histologic examination. The presence of epineurium, fascicular number, and fascicular area were measured. An inflammatory response in nerve tissue and the intrafascicular and epifascicular inflammatory index was measured by counting darkly stained nuclei with a Jandel Video Analysis System (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA).
Experimental injury (ie, epineurectomy) of nerves resulted in a statistically significant increase in fascicular number (P = .034), but not in fascicular area. For the intrafascicular inflammatory index, there was a significant main effect for drug (P = .002) and injury (P = .002). Experimental injury in both Gelfoam control and tetracycline grouped nerves resulted in an increase in intrafascicular inflammation. There was no significant increase in intrafascicular inflammation in either Gelfoam control or tetracycline grouped nerves when the epineurium was intact. The combination of both tetracycline and epineurectomy resulted in the largest increase in intrafascicular inflammation found among the groups studied. For epifascicular inflammatory index, there was a significant main effect for drug (P = .003) and injury (P = .001) that mirrored the intrafascicular inflammatory pattern.
The results of the present study suggest that dry, powdered tetracycline accentuates the inflammatory response in intrafascicular and epifascicular nerve tissue following epineurectomy. The maintenance of epineurium inhibited the inflammatory response in intrafascicular and epifascicular nerve tissues. Gel-foam was an inert material when placed against exposed nerve tissue. These findings suggest that tetracycline should not be placed in extraction sockets when injury of the inferior alveolar and/or lingual nerves are present.
Children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are at increased risk for thromboembolism (TE). Identification of a susceptible population is crucial for effective thromboprophylaxis. However, the risk factors for ALL-associated TE are unclear. Concomitant asparaginase (ASP) and steroid therapy has been shown to increase the incidence of TE. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)-ALL protocols use a combination of ASP and steroids during the postinduction intensification phase when high-risk (HR) patients receive thrice the steroid-dose given to standard-risk (SR) patients. We studied prospectively assembled cohorts of children treated on two consecutive DFCI-ALL protocols to define the risk factors for symptomatic TE. Ten (11%) of 91 patients developed symptomatic TE; eight (seven HR) during intensification. Seven (44%) of 16 older patients (>/=10 years) compared with three of 75 (4%) younger patients developed TE (P < 0.0001). Nine of 35 (26%) HR and one of 56 (2%) SR patients developed TE (P = 0.0006). Gender, ALL-immunophenotype, steroid-type or ASP dosing schedule did not alter the risk but older age and HR-disease were factors predisposing to TE associated with DFCI-ALL protocols. Age-related risk may partly reflect the effect of ALL-risk stratification. Higher dose steroids combined with ASP may lead to an increased risk of TE in HR patients.
Subjects treated with diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) showed significant reductions in performance on multiple-trial free recall, paired-associate learning, and serial learning tasks compared to placebo control subjects. The free recall task showed the largest drug effect with diazepam subjects failing in six acquisition trials to attain the level of performance achieved by placebo subjects on the first trial. Serial position curves in the serial learning task were changed by the diazepam treatment from their usual skewed form to symmetrical functions. Results indicate that diazepam exerts its greatest memory influence on the acquisition of new information.
Cerebral edema may complicate the course of fulminant hepatic failure. Response to conventional therapy has been disappointing. We present a patient with fatal acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure, with signs and symptoms of cerebral edema, unresponsive to conventional medical therapy. Cranial decompression was carried out. A justification of the need for further evaluation of cranial decompression in such patients is presented.
Although peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme (enoyl-CoA hydratase/L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase; BE) is a positive marker for peroxisome proliferation, it is completely absent or expressed very weakly in rat hepatic preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions induced by peroxisome proliferators (PP). After administration of PP for 8-15 weeks, some rats exhibit BE-negative preneoplastic foci but other rats do not. In the present study, to investigate the involvement of glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 gene polymorphism in interindividual differences in susceptibility to PP, we developed a method to determine the genotypes of rats. We then examined whether rats with one type encoding 198Asn-199Cys (NC-type) or another encoding 198Lys-199Ser (KS-type) exhibit differences in clofibrate (CF) susceptibility. After administration of 0.3% CF for 6 weeks or more, BE-negative foci were found immunohistochemically in KS/KS-type rats, but not in NC/NC-type rats. The number of BE-negative foci in KS/KS rats was 15.3 +/- 9.0 foci/cm2 of liver section after 6 weeks of CF administration, and the values did not alter thereafter. The mean areas of BE-negative foci in KS/KS rat livers increased during the period from 6 to 60 weeks. At weeks 30 and 60, almost all BE-negative foci exhibited a clear cell phenotype, a type of preneoplastic hepatic lesion. BE-negative foci were devoid of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, whereas surrounding tissues were positive for the receptor. These results indicate that rats that are polymorphic for the GST M1 gene exhibit different susceptibilities to CF in vivo.
Although current in vitro studies show local cytotoxicity of triamcinolone (TA) crystals if they are in direct contact with cells, a toxic effect of epiretinal TA deposits has not been reported yet clinically. For the first time, we present a case of potential cytotoxicity of epiretinal TA deposits in vivo.
A 68-year old patient underwent a re-vitrectomy with peeling of a macular pucker and the internal limiting membrane (ILM) combined with an intravitreal injection of 25 mg TA due to a secondary macular pucker with cystoid macular edema. Postoperatively, pronounced epiretinal deposits of TA crystals were identified in the area of the posterior pole. Two months after the injection a consecutive optic atrophy with central visual field defect and severe reduction of the visual acuity to hand movements was apparent.
Our case report indicates possible in-vivo toxicity of TA deposits in eyes subsequent to vitrectomy and peeling of the ILM. This is in accordance with previous in-vitro studies showing ILM and vitreous to be protective biological factors, but demonstrate pronounced cytotoxicity if TA crystals are allowed to directly adhering to denuded ganglion cells. Hence, we consider that TA injection should be carefully weighed in those patients with prior ILM removal.
Lamivudine has become a main therapeutic option for treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although drug resistance develops, the clinical course after selection of antiviral-resistant HBV mutants seems to be benign. However, we observed a severe clinical course of hepatitis B infection in several liver transplant recipients after the emergence of lamivudine resistance. This was associated with high viral load in the blood.
In this report, we characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-dependent enhanced replication of particular lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants selected in these patients, which were associated with sudden onset of liver failure.
The clinical course was characterized by a sudden rise in serum bilirubin, prothrombin time, and transaminase. HBV sequence analysis of these patients revealed both mutations in the "a-determinant" of the envelope and the YMDD (tyrosine, methionine, aspartate, aspartate) motif (domain C) of the polymerase protein. Transfection experiments with replication competent vectors indicated that the "a-determinant" changes were not associated with resistance, whereas mutations in the YMDD motif conferred resistance to lamivudine. More importantly, combinations of mutations in the "a-determinant" and the YMDD motif in patients with a severe hepatitis were not only resistant to lamivudine treatment, but showed enhanced replication in vitro in the presence of lamivudine. This observation was confirmed in separate laboratories.
Severe and fatal hepatitis B infection can occur during lamivudine therapy and may be associated with certain HBV mutants selected during sequential nucleoside and HBIg treatment. The lamivudine-enhanced replication shown by these mutants suggests that continuation of therapy with lamivudine could be deleterious in some patients.
Bupropion is an antidepressant with stimulant properties, which inhibits the reuptake of dopamine (DA) and norepinepherine, and is purported to enhance DA neurotransmission. Bupropion is considered an appealing candidate medication for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence. The current laboratory study was set forth to assess the impact of bupropion treatment on the subjective effects produced by methamphetamine in the laboratory. We also assessed the effects of bupropion treatment on craving elicited by exposure to videotaped methamphetamine cues. A total of 26 participants were enrolled and 20 completed the entire study (n=10 placebo and n=10 bupropion, parallel groups design). Bupropion treatment was associated with reduced ratings of 'any drug effect' (p<0.02), and 'high' (p<0.02) following methamphetamine administration. There was also a significant bupropion-by-cue exposure interaction on General Craving Scale total score (p<0.002), and on the Behavioral Intention subscale (p<0.001). Overall, the data reveal that bupropion reduced acute methamphetamine-induced subjective effects and reduced cue-induced craving. Importantly, these data provide a rationale for the evaluation of bupropion in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.
We describe an adult woman infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who developed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with histologically confirmed mitochondrial damage while receiving anti-HIV-1 combination therapy that included nelfinavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine. DCM resolved after discontinuation of the regimen, and cardiac function remained normal after initiation of treatment with nelfinavir, lamivudine, and abacavir, which indicates that DCM was induced by mitochondrial toxicity, most likely caused by zidovudine.
Patients do not always respond to treatment of visceral leishmaniasis with pentavalent antimony, and the drug has toxic effects. Amphotericin B might be useful as an alternative first-line treatment for the disease. We compared the efficacy of amphotericin and sodium stibogluconate in a prospective randomised trial in 80 uncomplicated and parasitologically confirmed cases of Indian kala-azar. None of the patients had received an antileishmanial agent before. Sodium stibogluconate was given at 20 mg/kg in two divided doses daily for 40 days, and amphotericin in fourteen doses of 0.5 mg/kg infused in 5% dextrose on alternate days. All 40 patients randomised to amphotericin were cured; of the 40 patients assigned to sodium stibogluconate, 28 (70%) showed initial cure and 25 (62.5%) showed definitive cure (p < 0.001). With amphotericin, there was quicker abatement of fever and more complete spleen regression with no serious adverse effects. Amphotericin is effective in the first-line treatment of Indian kala-azar and superior to antimony therapy.
Experimental models of Parkinson's disease have demonstrated abnormal synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal system, possibly related to the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). We tested the hypothesis that LID in Parkinson's disease is associated with aberrant plasticity in the human motor cortex (M1). We employed the paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, an experimental intervention involving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and median nerve stimulation capable of producing long-term potentiation (LTP) like changes in the sensorimotor system in humans. We studied the more affected side of 16 moderately affected patients with Parkinson's disease (9 dyskinetic, 7 non-dyskinetic) and the dominant side of 9 age-matched healthy controls. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes and cortical silent period (CSP) duration were measured at baseline before PAS and for up to 60 min (T0, T30 and T60) after PAS in abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles. PAS significantly increased MEP size in controls (+74.8% of baseline at T30) but not in patients off medication (T30: +0.07% of baseline in the non-dyskinetic, +27% in the dyskinetic group). Levodopa restored the potentiation of MEP amplitudes by PAS in the non-dyskinetic group (T30: +64.9% of baseline MEP) but not in the dyskinetic group (T30: -9.2% of baseline). PAS prolonged CSP duration in controls. There was a trend towards prolongation of CSP in the non-dyskinetic group off medications but not in the dyskinetic group. Levodopa did not restore CSP prolongation by PAS in the dyskinetic group. Our findings suggest that LTP-like plasticity is deficient in Parkinson's disease off medications and is restored by levodopa in non-dyskinetic but not in dyskinetic patients. Abnormal synaptic plasticity in the motor cortex may play a role in the development of LID.
Ethanol metabolism increases production of reactive oxygen species, including superoxide (O2(.-)) in the liver, resulting in significant oxidative stress, which causes cellular damage. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an antioxidant enzyme that converts superoxide to less toxic intermediates, preventing accumulation. Because the absence of SOD would confer less resistance to oxidative stress, we determined whether damage to hepatic proteolytic systems was greater in SOD(-/-) than in SOD(+/+) mice after chronic ethanol feeding.
Female wild-type (SOD(+/+)) and Cu/Zn-SOD knockout (SOD(-/-)) mice were pair-fed ethanol and control liquid diets for 24 days, after which liver injury was assessed.
Ethanol-fed SOD(-/-) mice had 4-fold higher blood ethanol, 2.8-fold higher alanine aminotransferase levels, 20% higher liver weight, a 1.4-fold rise in hepatic protein levels, and 35 to 70% higher levels of lipid peroxides than corresponding wild-type mice. While wild-type mice exhibited fatty liver after ethanol administration, SOD(-/-) mice showed no evidence of ethanol-induced steatosis, although triglyceride levels were elevated in both groups of knockout mice. Ethanol administration caused no significant change in proteasome activity, but caused lysosomal leakage in livers of SOD(-/-) mice but not in wild-type mice. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was reduced by 50 to 60% in ethanol-fed SOD(-/-) mice compared with all other groups. Additionally, while ethanol administration induced cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity in wild-type mice, it caused no such induction in SOD(-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, ethanol feeding significantly elevated total and mitochondrial levels of glutathione in SOD knockout mice compared with wild-type mice.
Ethanol-fed SOD(-/-) mice exhibited lower alcohol dehydrogenase activity and lack of CYP2E1 inducibility, thereby causing decreased ethanol metabolism compared with wild-type mice. These and other atypical responses to ethanol, including the absence of ethanol-induced steatosis and enhanced glutathione levels, appear to be linked to enhanced oxidative stress due to lack of antioxidant enzyme capacity.
We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 4,604 endometriosis cases and 9,393 controls of Japanese and European ancestry. We show that rs12700667 on chromosome 7p15.2, previously found to associate with disease in Europeans, replicates in Japanese (P = 3.6 × 10(-3)), and we confirm association of rs7521902 at 1p36.12 near WNT4. In addition, we establish an association of rs13394619 in GREB1 at 2p25.1 with endometriosis and identify a newly associated locus at 12q22 near VEZT (rs10859871). Excluding cases of European ancestry of minimal or unknown severity, we identified additional previously unknown loci at 2p14 (rs4141819), 6p22.3 (rs7739264) and 9p21.3 (rs1537377). All seven SNP effects were replicated in an independent cohort and associated at P <5 × 10(-8) in a combined analysis. Finally, we found a significant overlap in polygenic risk for endometriosis between the genome-wide association cohorts of European and Japanese descent (P = 8.8 × 10(-11)), indicating that many weakly associated SNPs represent true endometriosis risk loci and that risk prediction and future targeted disease therapy may be transferred across these populations.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective. Here, we report results from two genome-wide loss-of-function TDP-43 toxicity suppressor screens in yeast. The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS.
In Western countries, prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer of men and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Several genome-wide association studies have yielded numerous common variants conferring risk of prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed 32.5 million variants discovered by whole-genome sequencing 1,795 Icelanders. We identified a new low-frequency variant at 8q24 associated with prostate cancer in European populations, rs188140481[A] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.90; P(combined) = 6.2 × 10(-34)), with an average risk allele frequency in controls of 0.54%. This variant is only very weakly correlated (r(2) ≤ 0.06) with previously reported risk variants at 8q24, and its association remains significant after adjustment for all known risk-associated variants. Carriers of rs188140481[A] were diagnosed with prostate cancer 1.26 years younger than non-carriers (P = 0.0059). We also report results for a previously described HOXB13 variant (rs138213197[T]), confirming it as a prostate cancer risk variant in populations from across Europe.
To evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of combined use of p16-expressing adenovirus and chemotherapeutic agents CDDP or As2O3 on human bladder cancer cell line EJ, the human bladder cancer cell line EJ were transfected with adenovirus-mediated p16 gene (Ad-p16), with administration of cisplatin (CDDP) or arsenic trioxide (As2O3). The cell growth, morphological changes, cell cycle, apoptosis and molecular changes were measured using cell counting, reverse microscopy, flow cytometry, cloning formation, immunocytochemical assays and in vivo therapy experiments to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of such combined regimen. Ad-p16 transfer and CDDP or As2O3 administration to EJ cells could exert substantially stronger therapeutic effects than the single agent treatment. Especially in in vivo experiments, combined administration of p16 and CDDP or As2O3 induced almost tumor diminish compared to the partial tumor diminish induced by single agent. Moreover, delivery of Ad-p16, or administration of minimal-dose CDDP or As2O3 or combined regimen could induce massive apoptosis of EJ cell. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that administration of CDDP or As2O3 remarkably arrested EJ cell in G1 prior to apoptotic cell death. When treated with combined regimen, cells were arrested in G1 to a greater extent prior to apoptotic cell death. It is concluded that after introduction into EJ cell, Ad-p16 shows enhanced therapeutic efficacy for EJ cell when used in combination with CDDP or As2O3.
To further investigate susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies, we genotyped 5,500 SNPs across 14 associated regions in 8,000 samples from a control group and 3 diseases: type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD) and Graves' disease. We defined, using Bayes theorem, credible sets of SNPs that were 95% likely, based on posterior probability, to contain the causal disease-associated SNPs. In 3 of the 14 regions, TCF7L2 (T2D), CTLA4 (Graves' disease) and CDKN2A-CDKN2B (T2D), much of the posterior probability rested on a single SNP, and, in 4 other regions (CDKN2A-CDKN2B (CAD) and CDKAL1, FTO and HHEX (T2D)), the 95% sets were small, thereby excluding most SNPs as potentially causal. Very few SNPs in our credible sets had annotated functions, illustrating the limitations in understanding the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to common diseases. Our results also show the value of more detailed mapping to target sequences for functional studies.
The anthracycline doxorubicin is an effective chemotherapeutic agent used to treat pediatric cancers but is associated with cardiotoxicity that can manifest many years after the initial exposure. To date, very little is known about the mechanism of this late-onset cardiotoxicity.
To understand this problem, we developed a pediatric model of late-onset doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in which juvenile mice were exposed to doxorubicin, using a cumulative dose that did not induce acute cardiotoxicity. These mice developed normally and had no obvious cardiac abnormalities as adults. However, evaluation of the vasculature revealed that juvenile doxorubicin exposure impaired vascular development, resulting in abnormal vascular architecture in the hearts with less branching and decreased capillary density. Both physiological and pathological stress induced late-onset cardiotoxicity in the adult doxorubicin-treated mice. Moreover, adult mice subjected to myocardial infarction developed rapid heart failure, which correlated with a failure to increase capillary density in the injured area. Progenitor cells participate in regeneration and blood vessel formation after a myocardial infarction, but doxorubicin-treated mice had fewer progenitor cells in the infarct border zone. Interestingly, doxorubicin treatment reduced proliferation and differentiation of the progenitor cells into cells of cardiac lineages.
Our data suggest that anthracycline treatment impairs vascular development as well as progenitor cell function in the young heart, resulting in an adult heart that is more susceptible to stress.
Endometrial cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, causing ~74,000 deaths annually. Serous endometrial cancers are a clinically aggressive subtype with a poorly defined genetic etiology. We used whole-exome sequencing to comprehensively search for somatic mutations within ~22,000 protein-encoding genes in 13 primary serous endometrial tumors. We subsequently resequenced 18 genes, which were mutated in more than 1 tumor and/or were components of an enriched functional grouping, from 40 additional serous tumors. We identified high frequencies of somatic mutations in CHD4 (17%), EP300 (8%), ARID1A (6%), TSPYL2 (6%), FBXW7 (29%), SPOP (8%), MAP3K4 (6%) and ABCC9 (6%). Overall, 36.5% of serous tumors had a mutated chromatin-remodeling gene, and 35% had a mutated ubiquitin ligase complex gene, implicating frequent mutational disruption of these processes in the molecular pathogenesis of one of the deadliest forms of endometrial cancer.
In comparative studies of asthma, ipratropium bromide has been shown to have a slower onset of bronchodilator action but a longer duration of effect than beta agonists. An additive effect of ipratropium and beta agonists has been demonstrated, in addition to prolongation of the bronchodilator response. Most studies do not show a definite difference in responsiveness of atopic versus nonatopic asthmatic patients; there are, however, reports indicating a greater responsiveness to anticholinergic agents than to beta agonists in patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Ipratropium has been shown not to affect mucociliary clearance, sputum volume, or viscosity. It effectively inhibits the bronchial response to methacholine and, to a lesser degree, to histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and antigen. Protection against exercise-induced asthma with this drug has been variable, but ipratropium has been found particularly useful in psychogenic asthma. Its role in occupational asthma remains to be determined.
Inhibition of sodium-potassium adenosine 5'-triphosphatase ((Na(+), K(+))-ATPase) activity causes edema and cell death in the central nervous system, and impairment of learning and memory. Several sex steroid hormones have a protective effect against neuronal cell damage and the hypofunction of learning and memory. To examine the possible roles and mechanism of action of steroid hormones against amnesia induced by ouabain, an inhibitor of (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase, gonadectomized male mice were administrated ouabain (0.1 microg per mouse) intracisternally (i.cist.), and the learning and memory abilities of the mice were assessed by a step-through passive avoidance task. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of 17beta-estradiol (betaE2; 10 microg kg(-1)) or testosterone (TES; 1 mg kg(-1)) improved the memory impairment induced by ouabain, while administration of dihydrotestosterone (1 mg kg(-1)) or corticosterone (COR) (1 mg kg(-1)) did not. Treatment with the estradiol receptor antagonists, tamoxifen (TAM) (10 mg kg(-1); s.c. or 0.1 microg; i.cist.) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (10 mg kg(-1); s.c.), or the androgen receptor antagonist, cyproterone (10 mg kg(-1); s.c. or 1 microg; i.cist.), did not influence the protective effect of betaE2 or TES on ouabain-induced amnesia. Moreover, we studied the effects of several free radical scavengers-17alpha-estradiol (10 microg kg(-1); s.c.), alpha-tocopherol (VE: 200 mg kg(-1); per os (p.o.), ascorbic acid (VC: 200 mg kg(-1); p.o.), or VE+VC (200 mg kg(-1) each; p.o.)-on ouabain-induced amnesia, and compared those effects with that of betaE2. The administration of free radical scavengers had no significant effect on memory impairment. These results indicate that betaE2 and TES ameliorate the amnesia induced by inhibition of (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity, and that the protective effect of betaE2 is caused by a non-genomic, rather than a genomic effect or a radical scavenging action. Additionally, the ameliorative effect of TES does not appear to involve free radical scavenging, but its aromatization to estrogen could contribute to the non-genomic action of betaE2.
We examined the effectiveness of supplemental administration of flavoxate hydrochloride in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) whose nocturia was not adequately relieved by an alpha1-adrenoceptor blocker. Fifty-two patients who had two or more nocturnal micturition after administration of tamsulosin hydrochloride or naftopidil for 4 weeks or more received 400-600 mg of flavoxate hydrochloride in addition to an alpha1-adrenoceptor blocker for another 8-12 weeks. With supplemental administration of flavoxate hydrochloride, significant improvement was observed in the number of nocturnal micturition, total International Prostate Sympton Score, quality of life score and BPH impact index. No significant change was observed in the voided volume, Qmax, voiding time and residual urine volume. Supplemental administration of flavoxate hydrochloride is therefore effective for the improvement of nocturia and QOL in BPH patients resistant to an alpha1-adrenoceptor blocker.
