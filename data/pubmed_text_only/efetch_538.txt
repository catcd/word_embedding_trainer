Role of Helicobacter pylori infection in chronic gastritis and gastric and/or duodenal ulcers is well known. Simultaneously there are some articles in literature considering H. pylori as a cause of extra-gastrointestinal illnesses such as atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria or acne rosacea, hypotrophy, Schoenlein-Henoch disease, atherosclerosis or hypochromic anaemia. The aim of the study. was to asses iron status in aspect of plasmatic transferrin receptors concentration among children and youth with chronic gastritis with or without Helicobacter pylori infection.
Forty one patients were included as a study group. Range of age was 9-18 years. All patients were diagnosed due to chronic abdominal pains. There were 13 males and 28 females. Blood was collected from every patient for blood cell count, iron, transferrin and transferrin receptors concentration (sTfR) assessment before endoscopy of upper gastrointestinal tract.
Concentration of sTfR was higher than age norm among 29 (71%) of patients. Among patients with higher level of sTfR 20 (69%) had normal haemoglobin concentration and in this group 10 patients had H. pylori infection. During analysis of 12 patients with nornal level of sTfR normal haemoglobin concentration was found and among five of them H. pylori infection was stated. Among 21 patients without H. pylori infection 14 had normal level of sTfR and 7 had higher level of sTfR which means that 33% had hidden iron deficiency (involuntary of normal Hb concentrations). Among 15 of 20 patients with H. pylori infection level of sTfR was higher which means that 75% patients with infection had hidden iron deficiency (involuntary of normal Hb concentrations).
Level of plasmatic transferrin receptors can be good and sensitive indicator of iron deficiency and can be helpful in differential diagnosis of hypochromic anaemia and anaemia caused by chronic illness including chronic gastritis with Helicobacter pylori infection.
The oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) has been studied in autism because of the role of oxytocin (OT) in social cognition. Linkage has also been demonstrated to the region of OXTR in a large sample. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a haplotype constructed from them in OXTR have been associated with autism in the Chinese Han population. We tested whether these associations replicated in a Caucasian sample with strictly defined autistic disorder. We genotyped the two previously associated SNPs (rs2254298, rs53576) in 57 Caucasian autism trios. Probands met clinical, ADI-R, and ADOS criteria for autistic disorder. Significant association was detected at rs2254298 (p=0.03) but not rs53576. For rs2254298, overtransmission of the G allele to probands with autistic disorder was found which contrasts with the overtransmission of A previously reported in the Chinese Han sample. In both samples, G was more frequent than A. However, in our Caucasian autism trios and the CEU Caucasian HapMap samples the frequency of A was less than that reported in the Chinese Han and Chinese in Bejing HapMap samples. The haplotype test of association did not reveal excess transmission from parents to affected offspring. These findings provide support for association of OXTR with autism in a Caucasian population. Overtransmission of different alleles in different populations may be due to a different pattern of linkage disequilibrium between the marker rs2254298 and an as yet undetermined susceptibility variant in OXTR.
Prolongation of the QT interval associated with ventricular arrhythmias has been the most common cause of the restriction or withdrawal of drugs from the market in the past 10 years. Methadone, a synthetic opioid that is increasingly used for the management of chronic pain, has recently been implicated in the development of the prolonged QT syndrome. We present a case report of a patient who developed a prolonged QT while being treated with oral methadone for a chronic pain syndrome. Of particular interest in this patient is the fluctuation of the QT interval at a stable dose of methadone, suggesting that a single normal electrocardiogram (ECG) does not guarantee that the patient is not at risk of ventricular arrhythmias. After reviewing the current literature, we suggest that there is no dose of methadone that may be considered to be completely safe. Other risk factors for prolonged QT interval such as underlying cardiac abnormalities, electrolyte disturbances, and concurrent medications should be sought, and all patients should be monitored with serial ECGs even when methadone doses remain stable.
Nonsyndromic cleft lip and cleft palate (CL/P) is associated with environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors. Maternal polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have been associated with CL/P.
To determine the relationship between the risk of having a child with CL/P and maternal C677T and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms, the intake of folate supplements, and exposure to environmental factors during the first trimester of pregnancy, a case-control study of Mexican mothers (88 case mothers and 116 control mothers) was conducted.
A questionnaire was used to assess exposure to environmental factors. The C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism.
Mothers with the 677CT or 677TT genotype had a higher risk of having a child with CL/P than mothers with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-5.7). An increased risk of having a child with CL/P was associated with the lack of folate supplementation during the first trimester of pregnancy (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.9-7.6), and this risk was greater in the mothers with the 677TT or 677CT genotype than mothers who reported taking folate supplements and had the 677CC genotype (OR, 11.2; 95% CI, 3.3-37.5). Pesticide exposure was associated with CL/P. There was no significant association between either the A1298C variant or tobacco exposure and the risk of CL/P.
These results suggest that gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development of CL/P.
Electroconvulsive therapy has been a novel treatment for about half a century, effective for severe psychiatric conditions. Over the years, the treatment has been refined with the addition of anesthesia. Different inducing agents have been used in clinical practice over the last few decades including propofol, methohexital, and etomidate. Previous literature rarely mentions seizures soon after induction with etomidate and typically only in anesthesia literature. We describe 2 cases with different demographics, diagnosis, and treatment that had seizures with the use of etomidate as an inducing agent.
In a randomized open study, the combination of either prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or pentoxifylline with controlled vascular training was compared with vascular training alone in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease in stage IIb. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to treatment either of intensive vascular training alone (n = 15) or in combination with either i.v. pentoxifylline (200 mg over 2 hours BID, n = 15) or PGE1 (40 micrograms over 2 hours BID, n = 14). The basic therapy was a well-defined routine for vascular training, which was identical for all groups. The duration of therapy was 4 weeks. In all three test groups, there was a significant increase in the walking distance. There was a 119% increase in symptom-free walking distance in the exercise-only group. In comparison with exercise alone, the additional administration of pentoxifylline produced no greater effect; the increase was 105%. In contrast, administration of PGE1 combined with exercise achieved a remarkable improvement of 604%. Between-group comparison revealed the significant superiority of treatment with PGE1 (P < .05). During the 1-year follow-up, there was a reduction in the walking performance in all groups, albeit of variable extent. In the exercise-only and the pentoxifylline groups, the maintained increase in walking distance was only 30% compared with baseline values before the beginning of therapy. In the PGE1 group, on the other hand, the maintained improvement was 149%. Nine of 14 patients were still in stage IIa of peripheral arterial occlusive disease 1 year after PGE1 therapy.
The cause of postoperative shivering is not known. The theories and possible remedies are reviewed. Five hundred patients were observed for the possible effect of lissive doses of gallamine, and of analgesic or benzodiazepine premedication. Diazepam premedication appeared to reduce the incidence of post-halothane shivering.
Congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) is a heterogeneous disorder, largely due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis (CFTR) gene. Patients with unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD) and patients with CAVD in association with renal agenesis appear to have a different aetiology to those with isolated CAVD. We have studied 134 Spanish CAVD patients [110 congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) and 24 CUAVD], 16 of whom (six CBAVD, 10 CUAVD) had additional renal anomalies. Forty-two different CFTR mutations were identified, seven of them being novel. Some 45% of the CFTR mutations were specific to CAVD, and were not found in patients with cystic fibrosis or in the general Spanish population. CFTR mutations were detected in 85% of CBAVD patients and in 38% of those with CUAVD. Among those patients with renal anomalies, 31% carried one CFTR mutation. Anomalies in seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts were common in patients with CAVD. The prevalence of cryptorchidism and inguinal hernia appeared to be increased in CAVD patients, as well as nasal pathology and frequent respiratory infections. This study confirms the molecular heterogeneity of CFTR mutations in CAVD, and emphasizes the importance of an extensive CFTR analysis in these patients. In contrast with previous studies, this report suggests that CFTR might have a role in urogenital anomalies.
The hypothesis that hyperaldosteronism is not the sole cause of hypertension in dexamethasone-suppressible hyperaldosteronsim was tested in an 18-year-old male. After six years of little or no treatment, the hypertension and mild hyperaldosteronism were promptly decreased by a small dose of dexamethasone. During dexamethasone treatment, when aldosterone secretion was suppressed to less than normal and he was normotensive, steroids were given by constant infusion in an attempt to reproduce the hypertension of the dexamethasone-free state. Neither five days of aldosterone or 18-hydroxydesoxycorticosterone (18-OH-DOC) at 1 mg/day, nor desoxycorticosterone (DOC) at 30 mg/day caused hypertension. However, sodium retention and potassium loss was observed during aldosterone and DOC infusion. Hypertension was produced within five days during infusion with ACTH or oral metyrapone. The hypertensive effect of the latter was abolished by addition of aminoglutethimide treatment. These studies suggest that a steroid other than aldosterone, 18-OH-DOC, or DOC may be the cause of the ACTH-induced hypertension in this patient. The aminoglutethimide data suggest that the ACTH effect on blood pressure is due to a steroid, and the metyrapone studies suggest that the steroid may be an 11-desoxysteroid. Urine and blood collected under ACTH stimulation and metyrapone treatment may be a rich source from which we may characterize this hormone.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and related polymorphisms have been implicated in the susceptibility to oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In our study, three miRNA-related SNPs: rs6505162 A>C (pre-miRNA of miR-423), rs213210 A>G (3'UTR of miR-219-1) and rs7372209 C>T (5'UTR of miR-26a-1) were investigated in the Black and Mixed Ancestry population groups in South Africa. The potential cumulative effects of these SNPs, as well as gene-environment interactions were also analysed. In Blacks, rs6505162 A>C was associated with OSCC under dominant, additive and recessive models with odds ratios (ORs) 1.353, 1.404, and 2.858, respectively. This locus showed very strong interactions with smoke inhalation from burning wood or charcoal used for heating and cooking in very poorly ventilated areas (OR(GE)=7.855, P(GE)=9.17*10(-10) in the Black group). Furthermore, the miR-423-3p level was 1.39 fold up-regulated in tumour tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissue (paired t-test P value 0.0087). SNP-SNP interaction between rs2132210 and rs7372209 was found in both Black and Mixed Ancestry subjects. The AArs213210-CTrs7372209 genotype had a protective effect on OSCC risk (in the Black, OR=0.229, P=0.012; and the Mixed Ancestry groups, OR=0.230, P=0.00014). This study is the first to link SNPs in miR-423 together with environmental smoke exposure to risk for developing OSCC.
A case of convulsive muscle activity immediately after recovery from enflurane anaesthesia is reported. The implications for postoperative oxygen therapy and management are discussed.
We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites (NOx), and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead-induced hypertension. This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead-induced hypertension is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase (NOS) expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead-treated group (given lead acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given lead and vitamin E-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E-fortified food for 12 weeks. Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured. The lead-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma MDA concentration, a fall in urinary NOx excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension, lowered plasma MDA concentration, and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma MDA, or NOS expression in the control group. The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell-free preparations. In conclusion, lead-induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression. This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated NO inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension.
The ability of the calcium antagonist diltiazem to protect against reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in hypertrophied myocardium was studied. Hearts from normotensive and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats were Langendorff perfused and subjected to 10 minutes of stabilization, 10 minutes of left coronary artery occlusion, and 5 minutes of reperfusion. The incidence and duration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) during reperfusion were determined and the effects of diltiazem or vehicle (given as a single bolus 3 minutes before coronary artery occlusion) were assessed in hypertrophied and normal hearts. In vehicle-treated (control) hypertrophied hearts, VF incidence was 91% compared with 67% in normal hearts, and the median duration of VF was 272 seconds (mean 207.4 +/- 32.3) compared with 27 seconds (mean 110.6 +/- 36.6; p < 0.05), respectively, suggesting that reperfusion VF is more severe in hypertrophied hearts. In normal hearts, diltiazem 18 micrograms reduced VT incidence from 92% to 55%, reduced VF from 67% to 27%, and sustained VF from 42% to 9%. In hypertrophied hearts, 18 micrograms diltiazem reduced the VT incidence from 100% to 58%, reduced VF from 91% to 25% (p < 0.01), and sustained VF from 82% to 8% (p < 0.01). Median VF duration in this group was reduced to 0 seconds (p < 0.05; mean 24.7 +/- 22.6). Diltiazem did not significantly affect heart rate or coronary flow rate decreases during ischemia. However, developed tension, at the onset of ischemia, was lower in diltiazem-treated groups than in the control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Hemodynamic changes and side effects of anesthesia induction with etomidate or thiopental were evaluated in 83 ASA class I or II patients. Patients were randomly assigned to one of 12 groups according to pretreatment drug (fentanyl, 100 micrograms, or normal saline intravenously), induction agent (etomidate, 0.4 mg/kg, or thiopental, 4 mg/kg), and maintenance anesthetic technique (isoflurane-oxygen, isoflurane-nitrous oxide-oxygen, or fentanyl-nitrous oxide-oxygen). The purpose of this experiment, of factorial design, was to evaluate the combined effects of two or more experimental variables used simultaneously and to observe interaction effects. There were significant increases in heart rate in all groups, especially after tracheal intubation. These increases were attenuated but not eliminated by fentanyl pretreatment. Systolic arterial blood pressure increased significantly after intubation and was not affected either by fentanyl pretreatment or by the induction agent. Patients in whom anesthesia was induced with etomidate had a greater incidence of pain on injection and myoclonus and a lesser incidence of apnea than patients in whom anesthesia was induced with thiopental. Fentanyl pretreatment significantly decreased the incidence of pain on injection and myoclonus, but it increased the incidence of apnea when anesthesia was induced with etomidate. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was similar after thiopental and etomidate and was unaffected by fentanyl pretreatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Pisa syndrome (PS) is a dystonic lateroflexion of the trunk with a postural disturbance resembling the leaning tower of Pisa. Initially reported as a side effect related to antipsychotic therapy, this original dystonic posture is also manifested in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple system atrophy, or in rare idiopathic cases. Recent observations have described the onset of PS with subchronic course in patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report on the acute development of PS in a parkinsonian patient during treatment with entacapone/levodopa/carbidopa combination. This case illustrates how, in contrast to previously well-known chronic/subchronic forms, this axial dystonic posture may occur in PD as an acute onset reversible type, related to levodopa treatment.
Dysregulation of positive and negative selection, antigen presentation, or apoptosis in the thymus can lead to immunosuppression or autoimmunity. Diethylstilbestrol (DES), dexamethasone (DEX), cyclophosphamide (CPS), and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) are immunosuppressive chemicals that induce similar immunotoxic effects in the thymus, however, the mechanism of toxicity is purported to be different for each compound.
We hypothesized that genomic analysis of thymus after chemical-induced atrophy would yield transcriptional profiles that suggest pathways of toxicity associated with reduced function.
Female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to these immunosuppressive agents and changes in gene expression and immune cell subpopulations were evaluated.
All four chemicals induced thymic atrophy and changes in both the relative proportion and absolute number of CD3(+), CD4(+)/CD8(-), CD4(-)/CD8(+), and CD4(+)/CD8(+) thymocytes. The most significant impact of exposure to DEX, DES, and CPS was modulation of gene expression in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex and TCR and CD28 signaling pathways; this could represent a common mechanism of action and play a pivotal role in lineage commitment and development of T cells. Up-regulation of genes associated with the antigen presentation and dendritic cell maturation pathways was the most distinctive effect of TCDD exposure. These elements, which were also up-regulated by DEX and DES, contribute to positive and negative selection.
Genomic analysis revealed gene expression changes in several pathways that are commonly associated with xenobiotic-induced immune system perturbations, particularly those that contribute to the development and maturation of thymic T cells.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II) is the most severe complication during prophylactic treatment with low doses of heparin. Five cases demonstrate the life-threatening consequences of this immune-mediated thromboembolic disease. In order to improve prognosis it is most important to start therapy just before diagnosis is assured by laboratory tests. First choice treatment is the low-molecular-weight heparinoid Orgaran. In patients with an episode of HIT II both low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin will be contraindicated for a life time.
Using anesthetized dogs, this study compared treatment with lidocaine or bretylium for bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity. Pentobarbital-anesthetized and -ventilated dogs (n = 10) were given a bolus dose of bupivacaine, 4 mg/kg, and a constant infusion of 0.2 mg X kg-1 X min-1 to produce steady-state serum levels of 7.1 +/- 1.8 microgram/ml of bupivacaine. Using burst ventricular pacing, the ventricular tachycardia threshold was determined, along with hemodynamic and electrophysiologic parameters. The animals were then treated with bretylium, 20 mg/kg (n = 5), or lidocaine, 2 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of lidocaine, 0.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1 (n = 5). Bupivacaine-induced alterations in cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance were corrected by bretylium but not lidocaine. Bupivacaine caused a significant lowering of the ventricular tachycardia threshold, which was consistently raised by bretylium, while lidocaine was either ineffective or caused a further lowering of the threshold. Bupivacaine caused a significant increase in the Q-TU interval and resulted in an undulating polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, similar to that seen in Torsades de Pointes.
The hemodynamic and cardiac effects of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril, were studied in 28 hypertensives in a double blind, placebo-controlled, between-patient study. Hemodynamic studies were performed noninvasively by means of M-mode echo (central hemodynamics and left ventricular systolic function), 2-D echo-Doppler (left ventricular diastolic function), and pulsed Doppler flowmetry (forearm circulation). Examinations were done at the end of a placebo run-in period and 3 hours after benazepril administration, both on the first day and after 6 weeks of treatment (10 or 20 mg once daily, according to patient response). In comparison with placebo, benazepril reduced systolic (p = 0.04) and diastolic (p = 0.003) blood pressure, because of a significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.03), while cardiac output was unchanged. Forearm vascular resistance was reduced and brachial artery compliance increased, although not to a statistically significant level (both p = 0.07). Both systolic and diastolic left ventricular function were positively influenced by the afterload reduction: End-systolic stress was reduced by 12% (p = 0.07), as was the late diastolic peak flow velocity (p = 0.02). All hemodynamic changes were evident after acute benazepril administration, and no differences was observed between acute and repeated treatment. We conclude that, similar to other ACE-inhibitors, benazepril reduces blood pressure through a reduction in vascular resistance, while cardiac output and heart rate are unaffected. These hemodynamic effects occur as early as after the first administration and exert a favorable influence on left ventricular dynamics.
Differences in response to carcinogenic agents are due to the allelic variants of the genes that control it. Key genes are those involved in the repair of the DNA damage caused by such agents. This paper describes the results of a case-control epidemiological study designed to determine the genotypes of four of these genes in persons exposed to a single genotoxic factor, i.e. asbestos, who had or had not developed malignant mesothelioma (MM). Our working hypothesis was that an imperfect DNA repair, as revealed by subtle polymorphic variants, could reduce protection against the chronic DNA insult provoked by asbestos and eventually result in mutagenesis and cancer. Seven variants (i.e. XRCC1-R399Q-NCBI SNP, XRCC1-R194W, XRCC3-T241M, XRCC3-IVS6-14, XPD-K751Q, XPD-D312N, OGG1-S326C) were investigated in 81 patients and 110 age and sex-matched controls, all residents at Casale Monferrato, a Piedmontese town highly exposed to asbestos pollution. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When considered as a categorical variable, XRCC1-399Q showed an increased OR both in heterozygotes (OR=2.08; 95% CI=1.00-4.33) and homozygotes (2.38; 95% CI=0.82-6.94), although individual ORs were not significant. When it was considered as a continuous variable OR was significant (OR=1.68; 95% CI: 1.02-2.75). When genotypes were divided into "non-risk" and "risk" genotypes, i.e. those thought to be associated with increased risk in the light of the functional significance of the variants, XRCC1-399Q (Q homozygotes+Q/R heterozygotes versus R homozygotes) had an OR=2.147 (95% CI: 1.08-4.28), whereas that of XRCC3-241T (T homozygotes+M/T heterozygotes versus M homozygotes) was 4.09 (95% CI: 1.26-13.21) and that of OGG1-326C was increased, though not significantly. None of the haplotypes showed a significantly different frequency between patients and controls. This is the first report of an association between polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and asbestos-associated MM. Our data indicate that genetic factors are involved in MM development.
Acute ischaemic cerebrovascular attack may be an underreported complication related to chemotherapy. We report here the case of a patient with acute ischaemic cerebrovascular attack, immediately after administration of a first cycle of chemotherapy based on 5-fluoruracil and cisplatin.
To investigate the expression of CD14 on Kupffer cells during the course of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-mediated liver injury and its role in the activation of Kupffer cells.
Rats were administered CCl(4) twice weekly for up to 8 weeks. Kupffer cells were isolated from normal and CCl(4)-treated rats by the combined 'collagenase-pronase' perfusion method, discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. On the day after isolation, the cells were incubated with RPMI-1640 containing varying doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6 h. Supernatants were then collected for measuring the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of CD14 mRNA on Kupffer cells were determined by RT-PCR. The plasma concentrations of endotoxin were determined by chromogenic substrate Limulus amebocyte lysate assay.
Basic TNF-alpha production of Kupffer cells isolated from CCl(4)-treated rats at 4 and 6 weeks was significantly higher than that of normal (P < 0.05). Following LPS stimulation the production of TNF-alpha was markedly increased in Kupffer cells from the 2-, 4- and 6-week treatment groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, LPS-induced TNF-alpha production was dose-dependent. CD14 mRNA expression on Kupffer cells isolated from CCl(4)-treated rats was elevated following 2 weeks of CCl(4) administration and the maximum elevation occurred at 6 weeks. Gene expression was decreased in Kupffer cells after 8 weeks of CCl(4) treatment. CCl(4) administration elicited extensive changes in liver morphology, including steatosis, inflammation and necrosis. The plasma concentrations of endotoxin of CCl(4)-treated rats were increased during the time of liver injury.
Up-regulation of CD14 expression in Kupffer cells during CCl(4)-mediated chronic liver injury indicates cell activation and that they are more sensitive to LPS stimulation. Kupffer cells are critical effector cells in the early stage of liver injury.
All physicians who use heparin should be aware of immune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), including anesthesiologists who may need to provide intraoperative anticoagulation for a patient who urgently requires cardiac or vascular surgery but who has acute HIT or a history of recent HIT.
The literature dealing with HIT of relevance to anesthesiologists was reviewed, including studies of HIT antibody formation following intraoperative use of heparin; acute respiratory or cardiac arrest following i.v. bolus heparin indicating rapid-onset HIT; acute thrombocytopenia and thrombosis complicating intraoperative heparin use; circumstances in which it might be acceptable to administer heparin despite a previous history of immune HIT; and alternative anticoagulant approaches that can be used to manage cardiac or vascular surgery in a patient with acute or recent HIT.
Intraoperative exposure to heparin can trigger formation of HIT antibodies, and occasionally even lead to "delayed-onset" HIT. Acute respiratory or cardiac arrest following i.v. bolus heparin, or the abrupt occurrence of intraoperative "white clots," suggests a diagnosis of rapid-onset HIT, particularly if the patient recently received heparin. Several approaches are available to manage cardiac or vascular surgery in a patient with acute or recent HIT, so the treatment chosen depends upon local experience and monitoring capabilities. Several months after acute HIT, and particularly when HIT antibodies are no longer detectable, it may be acceptable to use heparin for intraoperative anticoagulation.
HIT is an infrequent but important topic for anesthesiologists because of the urgency and complexity of the various associated management issues.

Ochratoxin A (OTA) is nephrotoxic and a potent renal carcinogen. Male rats are most susceptible to OTA toxicity, and chronic administration of OTA (70 and 210 microg/kg bw) for 2 years has been shown to induce high incidences of adenomas and carcinomas arising from the straight segment of the proximal tubule epithelium. In contrast, treatment with a lower dose of 21 microg/kg bw did not result in increased tumor rates, suggesting a nonlinear dose response for renal tumor formation by OTA. Since the mechanism of OTA carcinogenicity is still largely unknown, this study was conducted to investigate early functional and pathological effects of OTA and to determine if sustained stimulation of renal cell proliferation plays a role. Male F344/N rats were treated with OTA for up to 13 weeks under conditions of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay. Cell proliferation in the renal cortex and outer stripe of the outer medulla (OSOM) was determined using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and immunohistochemistry. Histopathological examination showed renal alterations in mid- and high-dose-treated animals involving single-cell death and prominent nuclear enlargement within the straight proximal tubules. Treatment with OTA at doses of 70 and 210 microg/kg bw led to a marked dose- and time-dependent increase in renal cell proliferation, extending from the medullary rays into the OSOM. No effects were evident in kidneys of low-dose-treated animals or in the liver, which is not a target for OTA carcinogenicity. A no observed effect level in this study was established at 21 microg/kg bw, correlating with the dose in the NTP 2-year bioassay that did not produce renal tumors. The apparent correlation between enhanced cell turnover and tumor formation induced by OTA indicates that stimulation of cell proliferation may play an important role in OTA carcinogenicity and provides further evidence for an epigenetic, thresholded mechanism.
1. We have studied band 3 HT, a human red-cell band 3 variant with increased M(r), which is associated with abnormal red-cell shape (acanthocytosis) and increased anion-transport activity. 2. We have shown that the increased M(r) does not result from the presence of the band 3 Memphis mutation, and that the variant band 3 is covalently labelled by 4,4'-di-isothiocyanato-1,2-diphenylethane-2,2'-disulphonic acid (H2DIDS) less readily than normal. 3. cDNA cloning studies show that band 3 HT results from the mutation Pro-868-->Leu, and the possible significance of the mutation in the altered anion-transport activity and cytoskeleton binding properties of band 3 HT is discussed.
Carboplatin, a new analogue of cisplatin used in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma, has been demonstrated to be less nephrotoxic than its predecessor. To date, hundreds of cycles of therapy have been given without a significant incidence of renal failure. We report herein two cases of acute, nonoliguric renal failure in patients receiving intraperitoneal (IP) carboplatin as chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma. Each patient had received extensive previous treatment with cisplatin. The baseline serum creatinine levels in the patients were 0.9 and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. After four cycles of IP carboplatin in Patient 1 and five cycles of IP carboplatin in Patient 2, the serum creatinine levels abruptly rose to 9.0 and 9.5 mg/dL, respectively, within a week after administration of therapy. No other primary etiologies for acute renal failure could be identified in either patient. One patient required hemodialysis briefly. Renal biopsy specimens were obtained from both patients. Patient 1 had focal and moderate interstitial nephritis with mild periglomerular fibrosis. Patient 2 had an edematous interstitium with a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate, focal interstitial hemorrhage, and toxic changes in proximal and distal tubules on electron microscopy. Treatment with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day with a rapid taper over 4 weeks was done in both cases with the serum creatinine levels eventually dropping to 4.6 and 2.0 mg/dL, respectively. Acute interstitial nephritis and renal failure to this extent have not been previously reported with carboplatin therapy. The literature regarding carboplatin is reviewed with respect to the pathophysiology of its nephrotoxicity.
Recent data suggest that opioids can activate immune-like cells of the central nervous system (glia). This opioid-induced glial activation is associated with decreased analgesia, owing to the release of proinflammatory mediators. Here, we examine in rats whether the putative microglial inhibitor, minocycline, may affect morphine-induced respiratory depression and/or morphine-induced reward (conditioned place preference). Systemic co-administration of minocycline significantly attenuated morphine-induced reductions in tidal volume, minute volume, inspiratory force, and expiratory force, but did not affect morphine-induced reductions in respiratory rate. Minocycline attenuation of respiratory depression was also paralleled with significant attenuation by minocycline of morphine-induced reductions in blood oxygen saturation. Minocycline also attenuated morphine conditioned place preference. Minocycline did not simply reduce all actions of morphine, as morphine analgesia was significantly potentiated by minocycline co-administration. Lastly, morphine dose-dependently increased cyclooxygenase-1 gene expression in a rat microglial cell line, an effect that was dose-dependently blocked by minocycline. Together, these data support that morphine can directly activate microglia in a minocycline-suppressible manner and suggest a pivotal role for minocycline-sensitive processes in the mechanisms of morphine-induced respiration depression, reward, and pain modulation.
