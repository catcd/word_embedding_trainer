The patient is an 88-year-old male who presented to a weekly pharmacy-run blood pressure (BP) screening at the retirement community where he resides. His past medical history consists of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and altitude sickness. The patient's BP was 122/48 mmHg, which was lower than his average (148/64 mmHg). The patient was asked a series of questions to determine the cause of the BP decline. He commented that he does not drink much water, stating, "It tastes bad." The patient started acetazolamide six years ago for treatment of altitude sickness and it was suspected that this was contributing to the patient's taste disturbance. The pharmacist apprised the physician that the patient was experiencing a probable adverse effect from a medication and then developed a program to taper the medication based on the pharmacokinetics of the drug. After the drug was completely tapered off, the patient reported that not only had his sense of taste returned to normal, but his cognition had improved as well. He previously could not perform some of his instrumental activities of daily living without help, but now believes he can continue to live independently. He reported no dizzy spells since discontinuing the medication and his BP has remained stable.
Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis has been shown to result in arterial hypertension and an important blunting of the pressure diuresis and natriuresis response (PDN). The mechanisms mediating these abnormalities are not completely understood. In the present study, the role of several antihypertensive drugs to ameliorate these alterations was evaluated. The PDN relationships have been evaluated in rats chronically (8 wk) treated with the NO synthesis inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 40 mg/kg per d in the drinking water). Appropriate groups of rats were simultaneously treated with the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan at a low (1.5 mg/kg per d) and high (2.5 mg/kg per d) dose, with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (60 mg/kg per d) and with the calcium channel blocker verapamil (100 mg/kg per d). Chronic treatment with L-NAME significantly elevated mean BP (163.6 +/- 6.5 mmHg versus 105.1 +/- 3.6 in controls), reduced GFR and renal blood flow (RBF), and shifted to the right the PDN responses. Chronic administration of low-dose candesartan, captopril, or verapamil prevented the arterial hypertension and improved renal hemodynamics, but these levels were not completely normalized. High-dose administration also improved renal hemodynamics but induced reduced BP below the levels of control animals. Despite the normalization of the elevated BP, the PDN responses of these hypertensive treated groups were not normalized, and the slopes of the respective diuretic or natriuretic responses were very similar to those of the hypertensive untreated rats. The results indicate that interruption or blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and calcium channel blockade are effective treatments for the NO-deficient arterial hypertension and renal vasoconstriction. However, the PDN responses are not normalized, and this finding suggests that the antihypertensive treatment is not enough to overcome the renal alterations associated with the chronic deficiency of NO.
The preservative iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) (0.1% in petrolatum) was tested in 4883 consecutive patients for 18 months between January 1998 and June 1999. With regard to the MOAHLFA-Index, the study population comprised 37% males; 17% with occupational and 19% with atopic dermatitis; 31% with hand, 10% with leg and 17% with face dermatitis; 61% were age 40 and above. According to readings at D3, 0.3% were allergic to IPBC, with 14 + and 2 + + reactions. Doubtful or irritant reactions occurred twice as frequently. Patients exposed for 24 h (n = 1814) reacted less frequently (0.1%) than the remaining patients exposed for 48 h (0.5%). Considering the possibility that a certain proportion of + reactions could be false positive, the reaction pattern was evaluated. More than 80% of the positive reactions displayed a crescendo or plateau time pattern. Furthermore, 18 of 43 doubtful reactions (?) appeared as late as D3 (thus, these could be false negative), whereas the majority of doubtful reactions occurred earlier and displayed a decrescendo pattern (corresponding to a typical irritant pattern). In conclusion, the large proportion of '?' reactions may be due not only to the irritant potential of the substance, but also to test concentrations not being high enough to elicit an allergic reaction. We propose that higher concentrations of IPBC (0.3%) should be evaluated in a study also addressing suitable validation tests like ROAT or PUT.
The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha1 (nAChRalpha1) was investigated as a potential fibrogenic molecule in the kidney, given reports that it may be an alternative urokinase (urokinase plasminogen activator; uPA) receptor in addition to the classical receptor uPAR. In a mouse obstructive uropathy model of chronic kidney disease, interstitial fibroblasts were identified as the primary cell type that bears nAChRalpha1 during fibrogenesis. Silencing of the nAChRalpha1 gene led to significantly fewer interstitial alphaSMA(+) myofibroblasts (2.8 times decreased), reduced interstitial cell proliferation (2.6 times decreased), better tubular cell preservation (E-cadherin 14 times increased), and reduced fibrosis severity (24% decrease in total collagen). The myofibroblast-inhibiting effect of nAChRalpha1 silencing in uPA-sufficient mice disappeared in uPA-null mice, suggesting that a uPA-dependent fibroblastic nAChRalpha1 pathway promotes renal fibrosis. To further establish this possible ligand-receptor relationship and to identify downstream signaling pathways, in vitro studies were performed using primary cultures of renal fibroblasts. (35)S-Labeled uPA bound to nAChRalpha1 with a K(d) of 1.6 x 10(-8) m, which was displaced by the specific nAChRalpha1 inhibitor d-tubocurarine in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-exposure of uPA to the fibroblasts inhibited [(3)H]nicotine binding. The uPA binding induced a cellular calcium influx and an inward membrane current that was entirely prevented by d-tubocurarine preincubation or nAChRalpha1 silencing. By mass spectrometry phosphoproteome analyses, uPA stimulation phosphorylated nAChRalpha1 and a complex of signaling proteins, including calcium-binding proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and a nucleoprotein. This signaling pathway appears to regulate the expression of a group of genes that transform renal fibroblasts into more active myofibroblasts characterized by enhanced proliferation and contractility. This new fibrosis-promoting pathway may also be relevant to disorders that extend beyond chronic kidney disease.
Albendazole binds to parasite's tubulin inhibiting its glucose absorption. Its common adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, constipation, thirst, dizziness, headache, hair loss and pruritus. Although mainly metabolized in the liver, abnormal liver function tests were a rare adverse effect during clinical trials and we found no literature about albendazole-induced hepatitis requiring admission. This patient had a previous history of albendazole ingestion in 2002 resulting in increase of liver function tests. And in 2005, the episode repeated. We evaluated the patient for viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis, but no other cause of hepatic injury could be found. Liver biopsy showed periportal steatosis and periportal necrosis. The initial abnormal liver function test improved only with supportive care. These findings and the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (RUCAM/CIOMS) score of 9 are compatible with drug-induced hepatitis so we report the case of this patient with a review of the literature.
These experiments examined the effects of the antidepressant mirtazapine in several behavioral and memory tests. The tests were carried out on male Wistar rats weighing about 200 g. The drugs were injected 30 min before the tests. The aim of the locomotor activity test was to select a dose which had no influence on the motility of the animals and, at the same time, was active at least in one behavioral test. The chosen dose was 2.5 mg/kg. In the two-compartment exploratory test, 2.5 mg/kg of mirtazapine had a distinct anxiolytic effect after the first treatment, after 7 days the effect was weaker but still significant and it disappeared after 14 days. In the forced swimming test, the immobility time was shortened only after 14 days of administering the drug. In the maze test, mirtazapine shortened the food finding time (it improved memory) and counteracted memory loss induced by scopolamine. In the conditioned avoidance responses test (CARs), mirtazapine improved memory only after its earlier impairment by scopolamine. The authors cohclude, contrary to some published data, that after proper dose (adequate for other tests but not for the locomotor activity test), mirtazapine has a distinct memory improving activity or a memory restoring effect after scopolamine treatment.
It has been hypothesized that some of negative effects exerted by cocaine are mediated via sigma (sigma) receptors. This report demonstrates the effects of selective sigma ligands, panamesine, DTG, rimcazole and SA 4503, on the cocaine-induced convulsions in mice and locomotor hyperactivity in rats. Only panamesine decreased both these effects of cocaine, whereas DTG and rimcazole increased the total time of cocaine-evoked convulsions and locomotor activity. SA 4503 slightly enhanced and prolonged cocaine-induced convulsions but it was ineffective in locomotor hyperactivity test. Moreover, the increase in cocaine-induced locomotor hyperactivity evoked by DTG was antagonized by panamesine. The obtained results indicate that panamesine, a selective sigma ligand with a preference for sigma1 receptor subtype and potential antagonistic activity, decreased the effects of cocaine. DTG and rimcazole (potential sigma1/sigma2 sites agonists) as well as SA 4503 (potential sigma1 site agonist) showed rather opposite effects. These findings support the idea that sigma2 receptor subtype is involved in psychomotor stimulant effects of cocaine while sigma1 receptor subtype participates in the cocaine-induced convulsions. In addition, sigma receptor antagonists (especially sigma1 ones) are able to antagonize toxic effects of cocaine while sigma agonists facilitate them.
Previous work in our laboratory showed that the recommended oral dose of buprenorphine (0.5 mg/kg) was not as effective as the standard therapeutic subcutaneous dose for postoperative analgesia in male Long-Evans (hooded) and Sprague-Dawley (albino) rats. The aim of the current study was to extend this analysis to female rats. We measured the pain threshold in adult female rats in diestrus or proestrus before and 30 and 60 min after oral buprenorphine (0.5 mg/kg,), the standard subcutaneous dose of buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg), or vehicle only (1 ml/kg each orally and subcutaneously). Female rats showed an increased pain threshold (analgesia) after subcutaneous buprenorphine but no change in pain threshold after either oral buprenorphine or vehicle only. Estrous cycle stage (proestrus versus diestrus) did not affect the analgesic effects of buprenorphine, but rats in proestrus showed significantly lower pain thresholds (less tolerance to pain) than did those in diestrus. These results show that the oral dose of buprenorphine recommended for postoperative analgesic care does not induce significant analgesia in female rats and therefore is not as effective as the standard subcutaneous dose.
A generally accepted and validated laboratory model for smoking-associated pulmonary tumorigenesis would be useful for both basic and applied research applications, such as the development of early diagnostic endpoints or the evaluation of modified risk tobacco products, respectively. The A/J mouse is susceptible for developing both spontaneous and induced lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas, and increased lung tumor multiplicities were also observed in previous cigarette smoke inhalation studies. The present study was designed to collect data useful towards the validation of an 18-month mainstream smoke (MS) inhalation model. Male and female A/J mice were exposed whole-body at three MS concentration levels for 6h/day, and the results were compared to a previous study in the same laboratory and with a similar design. A linear MS concentration-dependent increase in lung tumorigenesis was observed with similar slopes for both sexes and both studies and a maximal 5-fold increase in multiplicity beyond sham control. The minimal detectable difference in lung tumor multiplicity for the current study was 37%. In the larynx, papillomas were detectable in all MS-exposed groups in a non-concentration dependent manner. No other extra-pulmonary MS-dependent neoplastic lesions were found. Gene expression signatures of lung tumor tissues allowed a clear differentiation of sham- and high dose MS-exposed mice. In combination with data from previous smoke inhalation studies with A/J mice, the current data suggest that this model for MS inhalation-induced pulmonary tumorigenesis is reliable and relevant, two crucial requirements towards validation of such a model.
Vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) are commonly used as the initial chemotherapy in myeloma patients prior to high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. We reviewed monoclonal protein responses and survival of 62 patients treated in this way. Among patients with IgG paraprotein, achievement of at least 50% reduction in paraprotein after the first cycle of VAD correlated with significantly better event-free survival at 3 years, compared with those having less than 50% response. We postulate that early paraprotein response may be used to identify high risk patients.
A 57-year-old woman complained about increasing pain and weakness in her hips and legs. 7 months earlier active (Crohn's) ileocolitis had been diagnosed. She had received several bouts of steroids and had been in clinical remission for 12 weeks under a dosage of 40 mg/d prednisone.
Clinical examination, laboratory work up, x-rays and MRI of the pelvis, bone scan, neurologic examination and muscle biopsy showed unspecific results. THERAPY AN COURSE: Steroides were tapered and replaced by weekly intramuscular methotrexate 20 mg which resulted in long lasting clinical remission. Pain and weakness persisted. 6 months later MRI revealed osteonecrosis of both femoral heads. 4 1/2 years after the initial diagnosis of Crohn's disease the patient complained about pain in her lower legs without evidence of osteonecrosis in MRI. Another 2 years later avascular osteonecrosis was diagnosed by tibial bone biopsy. Now MRI verified patchy osteonecrosis of the tibiae. Further osteonecrosis of the left foot were diagnosed by MRI ten years after initial diagnosis of Crohn's disease in the now 67-year-old patient. She is still in remission on weekly intramuscular 15 mg methotrexate.
The long interval between steroid treatment and recurrent avascular bone necrosis as well as the unusual pattern of bone involvement indicate that osteonecrosis is an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease. More reports and comparative studies are necessary to give more evidence that avascular osteonecrosis is an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease.
Thirty patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer were entered on a trial to evaluate the feasibility of combined radiation and concomitant 5-fluorouracil infusion. Patients had received prior debulking surgery (nine), induction chemotherapy (16), or no therapy (five). Radiation employed standard fractionation (180-200 rad/day) administered to a median cumulative dose of 5500 rad (range, 4500-6200 rad). 5-Fluorouracil was infused 24 hours per day throughout the period of radiation at a dose of 300 mg/m2/day for a median of 42 days (range, 28-56 days). Radiation complications included pneumonitis three of 30 (10%) and esophagitis (27%). Chemotherapy complications included stomatitis, two of 27 (7%), and hand-foot syndrome, three of 30 (10%). Treatment interruptions were necessary in six of 30 (20%) and four of 30 required parenteral nutrition. At a median follow-up of 12 months 26/30 (87%) maintained local control and eight had distant metastases (three of whom presented with Stage IV disease). 5-Fluorouracil delivered continuously throughout standard fractionation radiation to high cumulative doses is feasible and practical. Comparative clinical trials of the various combined radiation and chemotherapy schedules employed are in order. One additional clinical observation was the identification of six of 30 (20%) with brain metastases at presentation or after 12 months, all of whom had adenocarcinoma histologic subtype.
A neonate with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) developed refractory hyponatremic seizures following administration of anticancer drugs. The seizures did not respond to diazepam, phenobarbital, or lidocaine, but resolved immediately with administration of phenytoin. The low water-excretion capacity in neonates should be taken into consideration when fluid loading is attempted, to avoid renal damage upon administration of drugs such as cisplatin that have a potential damaging effect on the kidney. Phenytoin could be the therapy of choice for SIADH and resulting seizures in the neonatal period.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate sensory nerve function using current perception thresholds (CPTs) in patients who were administrated maprotiline. Twelve patients with post-herpetic neuralgia and 20 control subjects were studied. The patients with post-herpetic neuralgia were given a daily dose of 60 mg of maprotiline and were maintained at the same dose for 6 months. Twenty control subjects were randomly selected from healthy volunteers. ACPT test was used for quantitative assessment of A beta, A sigma, and C fiber transmission, which are associated with pain, by three (2000, 250, and 5 Hz) different frequencies of electric stimulation. CPTs of 5, 250, and 2000 Hz in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia 2 months after administration of maprotiline were 141.7 +/- 17.3 for 5 Hz, 120.8 +/- 12.9 for 250 Hz, and 256.4 +/- 18.0 for 2000 Hz, which were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than those (67.0 +/- 9.1 for 5 Hz, 73.4 +/- 7.0 for 250 Hz, and 191.3 +/- 20.2 for 2000 Hz) before treatment and than those (35.3 +/- 15.8, 62.0 +/- 18.9, and 198.9 +/- 15.8) of control subjects. An increase in CPT for 5 Hz at 2 months after administration of maprotiline correlated (r = 0.71, p = 0.01) with a decrease in pain score. There were no correlations between an increase in CPT and changes in Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) values until 3 months after maprotiline treatment. However, we found that an increase in CPT for 5 Hz at 6 months after maprotiline treatment correlated (r = 0.68, p = 0.015) with a decrease in HAMD values. In conclusion, administration of 60 mg maprotiline significantly increased current perception thresholds at 2 months after the administration.
The upregulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 in failing myocardium appears to contribute to dysfunctional beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) signaling and cardiac function. The peptide betaARKct, which can inhibit the activation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and improve betaAR signaling, has been shown in transgenic models and short-term gene transfer experiments to rescue heart failure (HF). This study was designed to evaluate long-term betaARKct expression in HF with the use of stable myocardial gene delivery with adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6).
In HF rats, we delivered betaARKct or green fluorescent protein as a control via AAV6-mediated direct intramyocardial injection. We also treated groups with concurrent administration of the beta-blocker metoprolol. We found robust and long-term transgene expression in the left ventricle at least 12 weeks after delivery. betaARKct significantly improved cardiac contractility and reversed left ventricular remodeling, which was accompanied by a normalization of the neurohormonal (catecholamines and aldosterone) status of the chronic HF animals, including normalization of cardiac betaAR signaling. Addition of metoprolol neither enhanced nor decreased betaARKct-mediated beneficial effects, although metoprolol alone, despite not improving contractility, prevented further deterioration of the left ventricle.
Long-term cardiac AAV6-betaARKct gene therapy in HF results in sustained improvement of global cardiac function and reversal of remodeling at least in part as a result of a normalization of the neurohormonal signaling axis. In addition, betaARKct alone improves outcomes more than a beta-blocker alone, whereas both treatments are compatible. These findings show that betaARKct gene therapy can be of long-term therapeutic value in HF.
Phenytoin hypersensitivity is a potentially fatal reaction to the chemical diphenylhydantoin. It is important to inform patients of possible complications and early sentinel signs of adverse drug reactions.
To investigate the in vivo antitumor efficacy of quercetin in U937 xenografts and the functional roles of Mcl-1 and Bax in quercetin-induced apoptosis in human leukemia.
Leukemia cells were treated with quercetin, after which apoptosis, Mcl-1 expression, and Bax activation and translocation were evaluated. The efficacy of quercetin as well as Mcl-1 expression and Bax activation were investigated in xenografts of U937 cells.
Administration of quercetin caused pronounced apoptosis in both transformed and primary leukemia cells but not in normal blood peripheral mononuclear cells. Quercetin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by Mcl-1 downregulation and Bax conformational change and mitochondrial translocation that triggered cytochrome c release. Knockdown of Bax by siRNA reversed quercetin-induced apoptosis and abrogated the activation of caspase and apoptosis. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 attenuated quercetin-mediated Bax activation, translocation, and cell death. Conversely, interruption of Mcl-1 by siRNA enhanced Bax activation and translocation, as well as lethality induced by quercetin. However, the absence of Bax had no effect on quercetin-mediated Mcl-1 downregulation. Furthermore, in vivo administration of quercetin attenuated tumor growth in U937 xenografts. The TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in tumor sections increased in quercetin-treated mice as compared with controls. Mcl-1 downregulation and Bax activation were also observed in xenografts.
These data suggest that quercetin may be useful for the treatment of leukemia by preferentially inducing apoptosis in leukemia versus normal hematopoietic cells through a process involving Mcl-1 downregulation, which, in turn, potentiates Bax activation and mitochondrial translocation, culminating in apoptosis.
Doxorubicin is used to treat childhood and adult cancer. Doxorubicin treatment is associated with both acute and chronic cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin are cumulative, which limits its chemotherapeutic dose. Free radical generation and p53-dependent apoptosis are thought to contribute to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
Adult transgenic (MHC-CB7) mice expressing cardiomyocyte-restricted dominant-interfering p53 and their nontransgenic littermates were treated with doxorubicin (20 mg/kg cumulative dose). Nontransgenic mice exhibited reduced left ventricular systolic function (predoxorubicin fractional shortening [FS] 61+/-2%, postdoxorubicin FS 45+/-2%, mean+/-SEM, P<0.008), reduced cardiac mass, and high levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis 7 days after the initiation of doxorubicin treatment. In contrast, doxorubicin-treated MHC-CB7 mice exhibited normal left ventricular systolic function (predoxorubicin FS 63+/-2%, postdoxorubicin FS 60+/-2%, P>0.008), normal cardiac mass, and low levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Western blot analyses indicated that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling was inhibited in doxorubicin-treated nontransgenic mice but not in doxorubicin-treated MHC-CB7 mice. Accordingly, transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted, constitutively active mTOR expression (MHC-mTORca) were studied. Left ventricular systolic function (predoxorubicin FS 64+/-2%, postdoxorubicin FS 60+/-3%, P>0.008) and cardiac mass were normal in doxorubicin-treated MHC-mTORca mice, despite levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis similar to those seen in doxorubicin-treated nontransgenic mice.
These data suggest that doxorubicin treatment induces acute cardiac dysfunction and reduces cardiac mass via p53-dependent inhibition of mTOR signaling and that loss of myocardial mass, and not cardiomyocyte apoptosis, is the major contributor to acute doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.
The initiation of epidural infusion immediately after intrathecal (IT) injection to prolong labor analgesia has gained increasing popularity. The effect of additional intrathecal fentanyl on levobupivacaine for labor analgesia has not been fully investigated. We wished to determine if addition of IT fentanyl to IT levobupivacaine in combined spinal epidural (CSE) could prolong obstetric analgesia when epidural infusion is initiated promptly.
In this randomized controlled trial, 40 nulliparous parturients in labor were recruited to receive either IT 2.5 mg levobupivacaine (L) or IT 2.5 mg levobupivacaine + 25 microg fentanyl (LF). A 10 ml/h epidural infusion of 0.125% levobupivacaine and 2 microg/ml fentanyl was immediately started. The proportion of parturients who delivered without breakthrough pain and the duration of analgesia were analyzed with the x2 test and Kaplan-Meier technique (using a log-rank test), respectively. Sensory block, motor block, pain scores, and post-block side effects were also evaluated.
The percentage of parturients with "successful" blocks, i.e. parturients not requiring further analgesic supplementation, was significantly higher in LF (87.5% vs. 44%, p<0.05). The duration of analgesia was also significantly longer in group LF (mean 530 min +/- SE65 vs. 361 +/- 66, p<0.05).
The addition of 25 microg intrathecal fentanyl to 2.5 mg levobupivacaine as part of CSE for labor analgesia decreased the incidence of labor breakthrough pain and resulted in a longer duration of labor pain relief. This may decrease the need for supplemental labor pain relief and the anesthetists' workload in the delivery suite.
A woman was first seen with water intoxication caused by the voluntary ingestion of water in an attempt to fill her bladder before undergoing pelvic ultrasound (US). As in two other reported cases, this woman was receiving medication that causes the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. A patient undergoing transabdominal pelvic US who is receiving these medications and whose bladder is not full should undergo examination by means of a transvaginal or endorectal route.
To clarify the mechanism of piperonyl butoxide (PBO)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice, male mice were subjected to a two-thirds partial hepatectomy, N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) initiation, and a diet containing 0.6% PBO for eight weeks. The incidence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)-positive foci and PCNA-positive cells was significantly increased in the DEN + PBO group compared with the DEN-alone group. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed up-regulation of genes related to metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 1A1 and 2B10, and metabolic stress, such as Por, Nqo1, Nrf2, abcc3, and abcc4. Early responsive genes downstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), such as c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), were also up-regulated in this group. Positive immunohistochemical staining for ATF3 was diffusely observed in nonproliferating hepatocytes of the DEN + PBO group, but altered foci were negative or weakly positive for ATF3. The nuclei of hepatocytes within ATF3-negative foci were positive for cyclin D. Thus PBO can induce oxidative stress, activate the MAPK pathway, and increase ATF3 transcript levels in hepatocytes outside the altered foci during the early stage of PBO-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice.
The incidence of adverse reactions to D-penicillamine in 155 patients with rheumatoid arthritis was analysed and compared with their history of adverse reactions to gold. Out of 125 patients who took only D-penicillamine, 45 developed side effects from the drug, whereas of 27 patients with a history of gold toxicity, 18 also reacted adversely to D-penicillamine. All patients who took D-penicillamine within six months after an adverse reaction to gold developed side effects from D-penicillamine. Fourteen patients developed similar adverse reactions to D-penicillamine and gold, and the interval between treatments in this group was significantly shorter (p less than 0.01) than in those who developed either differing adverse reactions to both drugs or no reaction to D-penicillamine after treatment with gold. An interval exceeding six months between treatment with gold and treatment with D-penicillamine in patients who have developed adverse reactions to gold apparently reduces the risk of adverse reactions to D-penicillamine.
The broad spectrum of activity of ciprofloxacin makes it an ideal drug for the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell rescue. We present two cases of ciprofloxacin-associated acute renal failure (ARF) in patients undergoing HDC. Maintaining a high index of suspicion for this complication will allow a prompt diagnosis, with discontinuation of the drug usually resulting in a reversal of renal failure. Renal biopsy usually reveals changes compatible with interstitial nephritis, but is not always possible in these patients due to severe thrombocytopenia following HDC. A brief course of steroid therapy may be beneficial although the role of glucocorticoids is difficult to ascertain in the absence of data regarding its efficiency in this clinical setting.
The Na/Ca exchanger encoded by the NCX1 gene plays an important role in calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle. We previously identified three in vitro signaling pathways that are of major importance in the regulation of Na/Ca exchanger gene expression in neonatal cardiac myocytes, the protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, and intracellular Ca(2+). To determine whether these pathways are important in vivo, we stimulated the PKA and PKC pathways and examined functional expression of the Na/Ca exchanger in adult rat heart. After a 3- and 7-day treatment, norepinephrine (200 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), isoproterenol (150 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), and phenylephrine (200 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) each stimulated a significant increase in NCX1 mRNA levels (35-85%, P < 0.05). Norepinephrine also stimulated a 35% increase in protein abundance (P < 0.05), a 20% decrease in relaxation duration (P < 0.05), and a 25% reduction in the fluorescence decay constant (P < 0.05) after a 7-day treatment. We conclude that a 7-day treatment of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists increases the expression of functional Na/Ca exchangers in adult rat heart.
No effective pharmacotherapies exist for cocaine dependence, although contingency management (CM) has demonstrated efficacy.
To compare the efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride and CM for reducing cocaine use in methadone hydrochloride-maintained individuals.
This 25-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial randomly assigned participants to 1 of 4 treatment conditions: CM and placebo (CMP), CM and 300 mg/d of bupropion hydrochloride (CMB), voucher control and placebo (VCP), or voucher control and bupropion (VCB).
Outpatient clinic at the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System.
A total of 106 opiate-dependent, cocaine-abusing individuals.
All study participants received methadone hydrochloride (range, 60-120 mg). Participants receiving bupropion hydrochloride were given 300 mg/d beginning at week 3. In the CM conditions, each urine sample negative for both opioids and cocaine resulted in a monetary-based voucher that increased for consecutively drug-free urine samples during weeks 1 to 13. Completion of abstinence-related activities also resulted in a voucher. During weeks 14 to 25, only completion of activities was reinforced in the CM group, regardless of sample results. The voucher control groups received vouchers for submitting urine samples, regardless of results, throughout the study.
Thrice-weekly urine toxicologic test results for cocaine and heroin.
Groups did not differ in baseline characteristics or retention rates. Opiate use decreased significantly, with all treatment groups attaining equivalent amounts of opiate use at the end of the study. In the CMB group, the proportion of cocaine-positive samples significantly decreased during weeks 3 to 13 (P<.001) relative to week 3 and remained low during weeks 14 to 25. In the CMP group, cocaine use significantly increased during weeks 3 to 13 (P<.001) relative to week 3, but then cocaine use significantly decreased relative to the initial slope during weeks 14 to 25 (P<.001). In contrast, by treatment end, the VCB and VCP groups showed no significant improvement in cocaine use.
These findings suggest that combining CM with bupropion for the treatment of cocaine addiction may significantly improve outcomes relative to bupropion alone.
A paranoid schizophrenic patient developed the neuroleptic malignant syndrome after receiving three doses of fluphenazine HCl and two doses of thioridazine while he was recovering from major trauma. Treatment with diphenhydramine and benztropine mesylate was ineffective. Administration of amantadine HCl resulted in resolution of all symptoms within 24 hours. After 2 days, the amantadine was discontinued. The following day, the neuroleptic malignant syndrome appeared. Readministration of amantadine again resulted in prompt remission of symptoms.
