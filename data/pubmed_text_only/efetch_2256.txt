Sequential CT studies were performed in 24 patients with infantile spasms, before, during and after ACTH therapy, in order to analyze the relationship between the dose of ACTH and changes in CT scan findings. In six cases CT scans did not return to their original state after ACTH therapy. Two illustrative cases are reported. There was a good correlation between the total dose of ACTH and the percentage decrease of brain parenchyma. It is concluded that 'cerebral atrophy' on CT scans may represent an accumulative effect of ACTH and that ACTH should be given with the utmost discretion, and in as low a dose as possible.
Ocular and cardiovascular effects of topical and intravenous pindolol have been studied in a balanced cross-0ver double-blind trial in 6 healthy volunteers. When applied to 1 eye pindolol lowered intraocular pressure in both the treated and untreated eyes with only minimal reduction in resting pupil diameter and light reflex response. The concentration in plasma was much lower and inhibiton of exercise tachycardia about half that when the same dose was administered intravenously. The findings suggest that beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs should not be used in the treatment of glaucoma in patients who also suffer from heart failure.
(1) Acquired long QT syndrome (aLQTS) is caused by prolongation of the cardiac action potential because of blockade of cardiac ion channels and delayed repolarization of the heart. Patients with aLQTS carry an increased risk for torsade de pointes arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Several antipsychotic drugs may cause aLQTS. Recently, cases of QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes associated with chlorpromazine treatment have been reported. Blockade of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channels, which plays a central role in arrhythmogenesis, has previously been reported to occur with chlorpromazine, but information on the mechanism of block is currently not available. We investigated the effects of chlorpromazine on cloned HERG potassium channels to determine the biophysical mechanism of block. (2) HERG channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and ion currents were measured using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. (3) Chlorpromazine blocked HERG potassium channels with an IC(50) value of 21.6 micro M and a Hill coefficient of 1.11. (4) Analysis of the voltage dependence of block revealed a reduction of inhibition at positive membrane potentials. (5) Inhibition of HERG channels by chlorpromazine displayed reverse frequency dependence, that is, the amount of block was lower at higher stimulation rates. No marked changes in electrophysiological parameters such as voltage dependence of activation or inactivation, or changes of the inactivation time constant were observed. (6) In conclusion, HERG channels were blocked in the closed and activated states, and unblocking occurred very slowly.
A 57-year-old woman with right bundle branch block +LPH and ventricular premature contractions developed complete heart block (CHB) following administration of disopyramide phosphate (Norpace). The ECG at the onset of CHB suggested block to have occurred in the trifascicular conduction system. On rechallenging the patient with the drug following the implantation of a permanent pacemaker, intermittent complete heart block developed. This case suggests that disopyramide should be used with caution in patients with bifascicular block patterns on ECG.
The small GTPase of Ras and Rho families are widely involved in human tumorgenesis and metastasis. It has recently been reported that pamidronate inhibits the mevalonate pathway, which is required for the prenylation of the small GTPase. We demonstrated a possible beneficial use of pamidronate in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
The effect of pamidronate on cell proliferation was analyzed with five hepatoma cell lines using MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by staining with DAPI and a histon ELISA assay. A cell migration assay was performed using the Modified Boyden Chamber. To analyze anti-proliferation effect of pamidronate in vivo, tumor volumes were monitored with the intraperitoneal injection of pamidronate after subcutaneous inoculation of PLC/PRF/5 cells into nude mice.
Pamidronate inhibited cell growth for all hepatoma cell lines. The amount of membrane associated Ras and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK 2) were reduced after pamidronate treatment. Pamidronate increased apoptosis and cleavage of Caspase-3, and -9. Pamidronate suppressed membrane associated RhoA and cell motility. In vivo, tumor volumes were significantly suppressed by pamidronate at three weeks (P<0.03).
We conclude that pamidronate has therapeutic potential in inducing anti-proliferative, apoptotic, and anti-migratory effects in HCC.
In this study, we investigated the effects of zinc L-carnosine, an anti-ulcer drug, on acetic acid-induced colonic mucosal injury and the correlation of these effects with expression of 72-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP72) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation in rat colonic mucosa in vivo. After intrarectal administration of zinc L-carnosine, the rats received intrarectal infusion of 5% acetic acid (1 ml). The colonic mucosal damage was evaluated by macroscopic assessments 24 h after the intrarectal infusion of acetic acid. Expression of HSP72 in rat colonic mucosa was evaluated by Western blot analysis before and after zinc L-carnosine administration. NF-kappaB activation was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Zinc L-carnosine inhibited visible damage in rat colonic mucosa by acetic acid. Expression of HSP72 was significantly increased at 6 h after zinc L-carnosine administration. Furthermore, NF-kappaB activation in colonic mucosa was suppressed 6 h after zinc L-carnosine treatment. These results suggested that zinc L-carnosine protects the colonic mucosa against acetic acid by induction of HSP72 and suppression of NF-kappaB activation and zinc L-carnosine may be a novel therapeutic agent for the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.
The effects of nitrendipine and hydrochlorothiazide were studied in hypertensive elderly patients. Blood pressure was reduced (p less than 0.01) by both nitrendipine (13/10 +/- 4/3 mm Hg [n = 15], mean +/- SE) and hydrochlorothiazide (25/11 +/- 4/2 mm Hg [n = 16]). After hydrochlorothiazide, plasma glucose, uric acid, and renin activity increased and plasma potassium levels decreased. Edema and flushing were the main adverse reactions during nitrendipine. The response of blood pressure and heart rate to head-up tilt were not significantly different under both treatments. However, the effects of both drugs on diastolic blood pressure and norepinephrine responses to head-up tilt differed significantly. We conclude that, in the elderly, hydrochlorothiazide lowers systolic blood pressure more effectively than nitrendipine. However, nitrendipine does not have any of the potentially harmful metabolic side effects that were found during hydrochlorothiazide therapy. The clinical significance of a lower vasoreactivity during nitrendipine, as was found with the head-up tilt test, has to be established.
The aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling molecules are attractive candidates for the development of targeted therapies for this disease. The present study showed that destruxin B (DB) inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HCC cells by decreasing the protein expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and increasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax. More importantly, DB also attenuates Wnt-signaling in HCC cells by downregulating β-catenin, Tcf4, and β-catenin/Tcf4 transcriptional activity, which results in the decreased expression of β-catenin target genes, such as cyclin D1, c-myc, and survivin. Furthermore, DB affects the migratory and invasive abilities of Sk-Hep1 cells through the suppression of markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A synergistic anti-proliferative and migratory effect was achieved using the combination of DB and sorafenib in Sk-Hep1 cells. In conclusion, DB acts as a novel Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor and reduces the aggressiveness and invasive potential of HCC by altering the cells' EMT status and mobility. DB in combination with sorafenib may be considered for future clinical use for the management of metastatic HCC.
There is a wide variation in sensitivity to lead (Pb) exposure, which may be due to genetic susceptibility towards Pb. We investigated whether a polymorphism (rs1800435) in the δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) gene affected the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of Pb. Among 461 Chinese Pb-exposed storage battery and 175 unexposed workers, allele frequencies for the ALAD1 and ALAD2 alleles were 0.968 and 0.032, respectively. The Pb-exposed workers had a higher fraction of the ALAD1-2/2-2 genotype than unexposed workers (7.8% vs. 2.3%, p=0.01). The Pb levels in blood (B-Pb) and urine (U-Pb) were higher in Pb-exposed workers carrying the ALAD2 allele compared to homozygotes for ALAD1 (median B-Pb: 606 vs. 499 μg/L; U-Pb: 233 vs. 164 μg/g creatinine), while there was no statistically significant difference in the unexposed controls (median: 24 vs. 37 μg/L, and 3.9 vs. 6.4μg/g creatinine, respectively). High B-Pb and U-Pb were associated with statistically significantly lower sensory and motor conduction velocities in the median, ulnar and peroneal nerves. At the same B-Pb and U-Pb, ALAD1 homozygotes had lower conduction velocities than the ALAD2 carriers. There were similar trends for toxic effects on haem synthesis (zinc protoporphyrin and haemoglobin in blood) and renal function (albumin and N-acetyl-d-β-acetylglucosaminidase in urine), but without statistical significance. There was no difference in Pb toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics associated with VDR BsmI polymorphism. Our results show that the ALAD genotype modifies the relationship between Pb and its toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system. This must be considered in the assessment of risks at Pb exposure.
Clozapine is indicated in the treatment of patients with tardive dyskinesia. However, there have been some reports of movement disorders associated with clozapine treatment in the literature. The authors report a patient who developed tardive dyskinesia 1 year after initiation of clozapine treatment.
The patient was a 65-year-old male with diagnosis of schizophrenia who had used multiple typical and atypical antipsychotics for 30 years. Clozapine treatment was initiated for his resistant symptoms. He developed buccolingual dyskinesia of moderate severity, which started 1 year after the initiation of clozapine treatment and did not ameliorate during follow-up.
This case may contribute to existing knowledge by raising the possibility that clozapine can induce dyskinesia.
In rat brain cortex, haloperidol initiates the long-term potentiation of K(+)-induced Ca(2+)-dependent noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) secretion in vitro and in vivo. In both cases, the long-term potentiation is caused by the long-term increase in catecholamine content in the NA and DA terminals, as it has been shown in cortical tangential slices. Acute intraperitoneal haloperidol injection (2.5 mg/kg) evokes catalepsy and increases the content of NA and DA in the brain structures with localization of catecholamine receptors on terminals. This increase appears to be caused, predominantly, by modification of the terminal DA receptors, since only a trend to catecholamine increase is observed in the brain structures with a mixed type of NA and DA receptor localization (on somata and terminals). It is suggested that the long-term and diffuse action of haloperidol after its acute administration consists in the anxiogenic reaction and consolidation of catalepsy without an additional procedure of training and in the absence of unconditioned stimulus.
Intrathecally administered sufentanil is frequently associated with hypotension and sensory changes in women undergoing labor. In this study, the authors examined whether intrathecally administered sufentanil has similar effects in pain-free individuals with low concentrations of progesterone (i.e., male volunteers).
Ten male volunteers were randomly assigned to receive an intrathecal injection of either 10 microg sufentanil or saline in a double-blind fashion. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and temperatures from the body core and skin of the calf and ipsilateral great toe were recorded. Cold and pin prick sensation, motor block, and visual analogue scores for sedation, pruritus, and nausea also were assessed. Current perception thresholds using the Neurometer current perception threshold instrument (Neurotron, Inc., Baltimore, MD) were determined for three frequencies (2,000, 250, and 5 Hz, corresponding to stimulation of Abeta, Adelta, and C fibers, respectively) on the upper and lower extremities.
Pruritus and sensory changes to pin prick and cold occurred in the sufentanil group but not the saline group. Neither group had a significant change in blood pressure, heart rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation, sedation, or core temperature. There was a clinically insignificant difference in the calf minus toe temperature index between the saline and sufentanil groups. There was a small increase in the current perception thresholds at 250 Hz in the sufentanil group.
Intrathecally administered sufentanil did not affect blood pressure in male volunteers. The other effects of sufentanil, however, were similar to those observed in women undergoing labor. This suggests that the hypotension occurring in these women after intrathecally administered sufentanil is secondary to relief of pain, rather than to a sympathectomy.
Copper promotion of angiogenesis has been known for more than two decades, but the mechanism of action of copper has not been explored until recently. Copper stimulation of factors involved in vessel formation and maturation, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is mainly responsible for its angiogenesis effect. Copper is required for the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a major transcription factor regulating the expression of VEGF. Copper would be transported into nucleus by a copper chaperon for superoxide dismutase-1. Copper is required for HIF-1 interaction with the hypoxia-responsive element of the target genes and ensures the formation of HIF-1 transcriptional complex, thus activating the expression of target genes including VEGF. On the other hand, excess copper can stabilize HIF-1alpha, the rate-limiting component of HIF-1, leading to its accumulation in cytoplasm and thus HIF-1 activation. The essential role of copper in production of VEGF makes it implicated in anti-angiogenesis therapy, such as the application of copper chelators in cancer therapy. However, suppression of angiogenesis is involved in the progression of heart hypertrophy and its transition to heart failure, therefore copper supplementation improves hypertrophic heart disease conditions. This dilemma of copper implications in cancer therapy and heart hypertrophy dictates a comprehensive understanding of a patient's condition before an implementation of copper manipulation therapy for different diseases. In this context, a development of diagnosis for copper metabolic changes as well as a tissue-specific copper manipulation would greatly benefit patients with an implication of copper manipulation therapy.
Notwithstanding the presence of resistance to chloroquine in some parts of Africa, this drug is still the most widely used antimalarial in the continent. One adverse reaction of chloroquine that has an important bearing on its use is pruritus. The risk of increasing the incidence of ocular toxicity through prolonged use of chloroquine for prophylaxis must be borne in mind by physicians. Another antimalarial that is likely to be used in increasing amounts in Africa is pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine. With prolonged use of this combination for prophylaxis, the adverse reactions usually associated with the long-acting sulfonamides are possible.Genetic abnormalities may also play a part in the incidence and severity of adverse reactions to certain drugs, e.g., primaquine and quinine. Most of the common adverse reactions are mild and have little or no influence on the acceptability and utilization of the drugs, with the exception of chloroquine-induced pruritus. Studies to define the precise epidemiology and pathophysiology of this reaction are urgently needed.
Healthy oocytes are critical for producing healthy children, but little is known about whether or not oocytes have the capacity to identify and recover from injury. Using a model ovotoxic alkylating drug, cyclophosphamide (CPA), and its active metabolite, phosphoramide mustard (PM), we previously showed that PM (≥3μM) caused significant follicle loss in postnatal day 4 (PND4) mouse ovaries in vitro. We now investigate whether PM induces DNA damage in oocytes, examining histone H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX), a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Exposure of cultured PND4 mouse ovaries to 3 and 0.1μM PM induced significant losses of primordial and small primary follicles, respectively. PM-induced γH2AX was observed predominantly in oocytes, in which foci of γH2AX staining increased in a concentration-dependent manner and peaked 18-24h after exposure to 3-10μMPM. Numbers of oocytes with ≥5 γH2AX foci were significantly increased both 1 and 8days after exposure to ≥1μMPM compared to controls. Inhibiting the kinases that phosphorylate H2AX significantly increased follicle loss relative to PM alone. In adult mice, CPA also induced follicle loss in vivo. PM also significantly decreased primordial follicle numbers (≥30μM) and increased γH2AX foci (≥3μM) in cultured PND4 Sprague-Dawley rat ovaries. Results suggest oocytes can detect PM-induced damage at or below concentrations which cause significant follicle loss, and there are quantitative species-specific differences in sensitivity. Surviving oocytes with DNA damage may represent an increased risk for fertility problems or unhealthy offspring.
To investigate whether the neuropeptide Y receptor 5 gene (NPY5R) is associated with obesity in humans.
The NPY5R gene was screened for polymorphisms by direct sequencing in two groups of Pima Indians, selected for extremes of body mass index (BMI). Genotype frequencies were analyzed for association with BMI extreme.
Full-heritage Pima Indians, non-diabetic and not first degree relatives. Obese group: 19 M/24 F, BMI = 49+/-7 kg/m2 (mean+/-s.d.) age = 24+/-2 y, lean group: 16 M/16 F, BMI = 23+/-2 kg/m2, age = 27+/-3 y.
Initially, the entire gene (proximal promoter, exon 1A, coding sequence, 5' and 3' UTRs) was sequenced in a subset of 20 individuals. No variants were found in the coding sequence, however three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the non-coding regions: (1) a C-->T transition located within the promoter 28 bp upstream of the exon 1A transcription start site; (2) a T-->C transition 94 bp downstream of the stop codon; and (3) a G-->A transition 432 bp downstream of the stop codon. The polymorphisms were then screened in all 75 subjects.
The polymorphisms had mean heterozygosities of 0.34-0.50 and were in strong linkage disequilibrium (P<0.001). Genotype frequencies differed significantly in lean and obese Pimas for P2 (P=0.04) and for a triple haplotype (P=0.02, Bonferroni corrected).
Considering the importance of this gene in regulation of body weight, the association of these polymorphisms with extremes of BMI in Pima Indians indicates that NPY5R, or a locus nearby, may contribute to susceptibility to obesity in this population.
As an antidepressant, bupropion is considered to be a safe agent that usually causes infrequent and mild increase of serum liver enzymes. Asymptomatic elevation of serum transaminases was previously reported only in a single case. We describe a patient who developed typical acute hepatitis after receiving six weeks of bupropion for depression. His presentation was characterized with acute onset of symptoms associated with significantly elevated ALT, AST, and LDH and acute hepatic inflammation. The clinical course of our patient, including incubation period, pattern of liver enzyme elevation, and time of recovery, was similar to, but much more severe than, the case reported by Oslin and Duffy. Discontinuation of bupropion was followed by a rapid resolution of clinical symptoms and liver enzymes. The incidence of bupropion-induced hepatitis remains to be defined even though it appears to be relatively low. Since the clinical application of bupropion is broader, we must be aware of the clinical entity of bupropion-induced hepatitis.
Patients with resistant or recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with vindesine 3 mg/m2/IV weekly X 4, daunomycin 25 mg/m2/IV weekly X 4, and prednisone 40 mg/m2/PO daily X 28. Seventeen (44%) of 38 evaluable patients achieved complete remission. Fifty-one percent of 31 patients in first relapse achieved complete remission, while only one of five in second or third relapse and neither of two resistant to first induction achieved complete remission. The major toxicity was hematologic. The median duration of complete remission was only 6 weeks and median survival from start of the study, 3 months, with 22% patients remaining alive at 10 months. We conclude that the vindesine, prednisone, and daunomycin combination is no more effective than vincristine, prednisone, and daunomycin in achieving remission of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, and is more toxic than the latter regimen.
A pupillopharmacological study has been carried out to evaluate the influence of two calcium blockers (CBs), flunarizine and nimodipine, on iris neurotransmission in migraine patients. Pretreatment with an oral dose of flunarizine or nimodipine markedly decreased the mydriasis induced by instillation of tyramine, a noradrenaline releaser. On the contrary, both drugs did not change the mydriasis by conjunctival phenylephrine, a postsynaptic adrenoceptor stimulant. In addition, nimodipine abolished the miosis caused by echothiophate iodide eye drops, a putative releaser of substance P from trigeminal sensory nerve endings. These findings suggest the idea that CBs treatment in migraine syndromes acts at presynaptic level by attenuating calcium-dependent release of monoaminergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters.
Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms. It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational.
To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, heart disease, venous thromboembolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gallbladder disease, cognitive function, dementia, fractures and quality of life.
We searched the following databases up to November 2004: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched.
Randomised double-blind trials of HT (oestrogens with or without progestogens) versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women.
Fifteen RCTs were included. Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently. They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes.
All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after 3 years), breast cancer (after 5 years) and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease. Overall, the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long-term use. Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism. No trials focussed specifically on younger women. However, one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year-old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT; their absolute risk remained very low.
HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.
A patient had torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia related to psychotherapy with haloperidol in conventional doses. The QT interval was prolonged, and shortened after the cessation of the medication and infusion of isoproterenol. Concomitantly, torsades de pointes bursts disappeared. The observation might contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of sudden death of patients during pharmacologic psychotherapy.
A 40-year-old male patient with carcinoma of the tonsil was put on a 5-fluorouracil and cisplatinum regimen. On day 2 during 5-fluorouracil infusion, he had features of myocardial ischemia manifesting as angina and ST-elevation in ECG. These vasospastic ischemic changes subsided after nitroglycerine plus nifedipine therapy. Such vasospastic toxicity of 5-fluorouracil is rare and few such cases have been reported.
Unsatisfactory treatment results of acute myeloblastic leukaemia inspire the search for new drugs, characterised by higher efficiency and lower toxicity. The aim of the study was the assessment of the efficiency and side effects associated with the implementation of IDA-FLAG protocol.
The assessment of treatment results and undesirable effects was based on the material of 4 children with the relapse of acute myeloblastic leukaemia, after a total of 6 IDA-FLAG protocols.
Complete remission was obtained in 2 (50%) children, with mean remission time of 13.5 months. One of the children underwent the transplantation of haematopoietic cells from unrelated donor. The main side effect observed was bone marrow aplasia. Leucopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia persisted for approx. 20 days. Apart from haematological symptoms, the following were also observed: the symptoms of intolerance after ARA-C, aspergillosis of paranasal sinuses and lungs and severe coagulation disorders.
IDA-FLAG protocol may be recommended for use in children with AML relapse and the undesirable effects observed are acceptable.
