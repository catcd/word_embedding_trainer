To determine the prevalence of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation among patients in opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) and to investigate mortality potentially attributable to QTc prolongation in the Norwegian OMT programme.
Two hundred OMT patients in Oslo were recruited to the QTc assessment study between October 2006 and August 2007. The Norwegian register of all patients receiving OMT in Norway (January 1997-December 2003) and the national death certificate register were used to assess mortality. Mortality records were examined for the 90 deaths that had occurred among 2382 patients with 6450 total years in OMT.
The QTc interval was assessed by electrocardiography (ECG). All ECGs were examined by the same cardiologist, who was blind to patient history and medication. Mortality was calculated by cross-matching the OMT register and the national death certificate register: deaths that were possibly attributable to QTc prolongation were divided by the number of patient-years in OMT.
In the QTc assessment sample (n = 200), 173 patients (86.5%) received methadone and 27 (13.5%) received buprenorphine. In the methadone group, 4.6% (n = 8) had a QTc above 500 milliseconds; 15% (n = 26) had a QTc interval above 470 milliseconds; and 28.9% (n = 50) had a QTc above 450 milliseconds. All patients receiving buprenorphine (n = 27) had QTc results <450 milliseconds. A positive dose-dependent association was identified between QTc length and dose of methadone, and all patients with a QTc above 500 milliseconds were taking methadone doses of 120 mg or more. OMT patient mortality, where QTc prolongation could not be excluded as the cause of death, was 0.06/100 patient-years. Only one death among 3850 OMT initiations occurred within the first month of treatment.
Of the methadone patients, 4.6% had QTc intervals above 500 milliseconds. The maximum mortality attributable to QTc prolongation was low: 0.06 per 100 patient-years.
The mechanism of action of sulfasalazine (SASP) in male infertility is not well elucidated. For it, an oxidative stress-like mechanism inductor of infertility was hypothesized. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (20/group) were orally administered 0, 300, and 600mg SASP/kg body weight for 14 days. One-half of animals in each group remained an additional period of 14 days without treatment. SASP induced a significant decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) at the highest dose in both testis and epididymis. GR remained altered in these tissues within the recovery period. However, an increase in SOD was noted in epididymis. An increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was noted in all SASP-treated groups. In epididymis, catalase (CAT) significantly increased at 600mg/(kgday). These results suggest that SASP induces oxidative stress, which in turn might act as a possible mechanism of male-induced infertility.
A case of hepatotoxicity and encephalopathy (Reye's syndrome?) associated with salicylate therapy is presented and the aetiology of this syndrome is discussed. Hepatotoxicity developed with salicylate serum concentrations not exceeding therapeutic serum levels. The importance of controlling serum salicylate concentration and transaminase activity particularly during the first fourteen days of therapy is emphasized.
Fifty-two patients with progressive advanced breast cancer were treated with the novel antifolate CB 3717 (N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazofolic acid) which inhibits thymidylate synthetase. Forty-six patients were pretreated with hormones, 43 with cytotoxic chemotherapy and 39 patients with both treatments. Eight of 48 patients (16.6%) evaluable for response had partial responses (confidence limits 7.4-30.2%, 95% confidence level) following CB 3717 administration. Liver function abnormalities, reversible in most cases, were the most commonest toxicities and were frequently accompanied by malaise. Severe renal failure occurred in eight patients, five of whom had had partial responses to CB 3717. This study shows the importance of thymidylate synthetase as a target for therapy but the clinical value of CB 3717 is limited by its hepatic and renal toxicities.
Azotemia and diabetes mellitus are now well-known adverse reactions associated with Pentamidine treatment, especially since its prescription in case of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. We report the case of a 2 year-old boy, treated for kala-azar with pentamidine and N-methyl glucamine antimoniate who developed adverse effects, characterized by a nephrotic syndrome associated with the classic acute tubular necrosis, and transient diabetes mellitus.
An acute kidney failure (AKF) was present at birth in a 28 week-old premature infant exposed in utero to ketoprofen during the last 4 days of pregnancy. Usual causes of AKF were not identified. Thus, AKF might be due to a ketoprofen-induced impairment in renal prostaglandin synthesis.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic administration of interferon-alpha 2b for the prevention of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative stress and nephrotoxicity.
Thirty rats were divided into three groups: control, CCl4+placebo (CCl4+P) and CCl4+interferon-alpha 2b (CCl4+INF). Control rats were treated with pure olive oil. The other rats were treated for seven weeks with subcutaneous injections of CCl4 (0.15 mL /kg) in pure olive oil three times a week. Rats were killed at the end of the seventh week and renal histopathological examinations were done: specimens of renal tissue were obtained for investigating oxidative stress parameters, including malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px).
Tubular changes, glomerular hypercellularity, and capillary obliteration were significantly less in the CCl4+INF group than with CCl4+P (p<0.05) and the interstitial fibrosis score for the CCl4+INF group was similar to the control group. However, the interstitial inflammation score was higher in the CCl4+INF group than the control group (p<0.05). No change was observed in the CCl4+P group. Renal MDA levels in the control and CCl4+INF groups were significantly lower than the CCl4+P group, while GSH-Px was significantly higher (p<0.001). There was no difference between the control and CCl4+INF groups in oxidative stress markers (p>0.05).
Administration of interferon-alpha 2b to CCl4-treated rats prevented interstitial fibrosis, probably as a result of its antifibrogenic effect. It also reduced intrarenal oxidative stress in rats with CCl4-induced nephrotoxicity.
The successful resumption of high-dose methotrexate in a 13-year-old boy with recurrent anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) who suffered renal dysfunction after a 24-hour infusion of high-dose methotrexate and required treatment with carboxypeptidase G(2) (CPDG(2) ) is described.
A 13-year-old boy who had been diagnosed in 2001 with stage I ALCL was admitted to the hospital in February 2005 after he developed a smaller left axillary mass in the area of his original mass. Recurrent ALCL was diagnosed, and treatments were initiated based on branch K3 of the protocol published in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (NHL-BFM) trial 90. In the NHL-BFM 90 protocol, all AA and BB courses include high-dose methotrexate therapy, which consists of aggressive alkalinized hydration, methotrexate 5 g/m(2) given as an i.v. infusion over 24 hours, and leucovorin rescue. During course BB2, the boy's serum methotrexate values exceeded NHL-BFM goals at 36, 42, and 48 hours. Because the patient's elimination of methotrexate remained slow and his serum creatinine level remained above normal limits, CPDG(2) was obtained for the treatment of methotrexate toxicity. The patient tolerated the CPDG(2) without adverse effects, and the patient's serum methotrexate concentration decreased from 14.47 to 0.66 microM. The patient went on to complete six courses based on the protocol. High-dose methotrexate was resumed at 50% then 100% of the original dose. He is currently in remission on maintenance therapy.
A 13-year-old boy with recurrent ALCL had methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity following high-dose methotrexate. The resultant delayed methotrexate clearance required the standard therapies as well as use of investigational CPDG(2). High-dose methotrexate was successfully resumed.
The binding of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to the 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) is a prerequisite for subsequent formation of leukotrienes (LT) from arachidonic acid. We have shown that FLAP antagonist administration decreased proteinuria in glomerulonephritic patients. In this follow-up study, we assessed the role for FLAP in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.
Diabetic rats were treated for 4 weeks with FLAP (BAY X-1005, 200 mg/kg) or 5-LO (Zileuton, 80 mg/Kg) antagonists. Proteinuria, renal function and LT production was assessed. We also determined protein permeability of cultured glomerular endothelial cells (which possess no 5-LO) by measuring their permeability to radiolabeled albumin with and without FLAP antagonists.
FLAP mRNA levels increased dramatically in glomeruli from diabetic animals compared to controls. Inhibition of FLAP (but not inhibition of 5-LO) reduced proteinuria, with no effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Interestingly, diabetes-induced rises in urinary excretion and glomerular production of leukotrienes were not modified by the inhibitors. Increased FLAP expression in glomerular endothelial cells in culture was associated with an increase in albumin permeability, and this increase was abolished by FLAP antagonists. On the other hand, addition of LTA(4) led to increases in leukotriene formation and in permeability. This increase in permeability was also reduced by co-incubation with FLAP antagonists, whereas the increase in leukotriene synthesis was not modified.
These results suggest a role for FLAP other than the activation of 5-LO, possibly in protein handling, and point to FLAP antagonists as anti-proteinuric agents.
The prognosis of patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (ACUP) is dismal. Various chemotherapy regimens have yielded disappointing response rates and survival. Based on a promising report of Goldberg et al. (J Clin Oncol 1986, 4, 395-399) we performed a phase II study with 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and mitomycin C (FAM). Only three out of 22 evaluable patients achieved a partial response (14%) for a duration of 22, 30 and 74+ weeks. Median survival was 54+ weeks (range 35-74+ weeks) for responding patients and 33+ weeks (range 9-74+ weeks) for all treated patients. One patient (5%) developed mitomycin C induced hemolytic uremic syndrome. FAM cannot be recommended for routine use in patients with ACUP.
Coronary artery spasm is a rarely reported condition after heart transplantation. We report a case of exercise-induced coronary artery spasm in a patient 1-year after orthotopic heart transplantation. Serial quantitative coronary angiography showed significant diffuse loss of luminal diameter. Provocative testing with intracoronary acetylcholine and intravenous methylergonovine maleate was performed in an effort to document efficacy of the antispasm regimen. Infusion of acetylcholine into the left anterior descending coronary artery resulted in transient closure of the vessel. Diffuse spasm resulting in hypotension and ventricular fibrillation occurred with intravenous methylergonovine maleate administration. Because of the risk of provoking diffuse spasm, intravenous administration of methylergonovine maleate should be avoided in the posttransplantation setting. Review of the literature suggests that coronary artery spasm after transplantation is often associated with severe transplant coronary artery disease and may be associated with a poor prognosis. Coronary artery spasm may be a more common cause of syncope and death after transplantation than it is currently thought to be.
The capacity of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system to modify the acutely autotransplanted heart was investigated in eight anesthetized open-chest canine preparations in which the adrenal glands had been removed from the circulation. Cardiac effects elicited by isoproterenol and nicotine were also examined before and after heart-lung transplantation. Cardiac augmentation induced by isoproterenol was similar before and immediately after cardiopulmonary transplantation, indicating that the surgery did not obtund cardiac myocyte function significantly. The initial bradycardia induced by nicotine was greater before transplantation. The subsequent augmentation in left atrial systolic pressure, as well as right and left ventricular intramyocardial systolic pressures, induced by nicotine were similar before and after transplantation. When nicotine was administered to transplanted preparations after atropine administration, cardiac augmentation was induced. Cardiac augmentation was not induced by nicotine after subsequent beta-adrenergic blockade. These data indicate that nicotine-sensitive adrenergic neurons which accompany the transplanted heart are capable of inducing considerable cardiac augmentation. Power spectral analysis of heart rate and left ventricular chamber rate of pressure rise variability indicated an almost complete lack of power in these indexes after, as opposed to before, transplantation. Together with intrinsic cardiac cholinergic neurons, intrinsic cardiac adrenergic neurons may be responsible for physiologically and pharmacologically induced alterations in cardiac variables that occur in acutely transplanted hearts.
90% of the injected dose of succinylcholine is hydrolysed by serum cholinesterase (E.C.3.I.I.8) Abnormal variants of serum cholinesterase lead to prolonged apnea. This report presents the results of 62 serum cholinesterase phenotyping including 12 cases of prolonged apneas. One clinical case of prolonged apnea in a patient homozygous for the atypical cholinesterase gene is presented with a study of his genealogy. The phenotypes were established on the basis of dibucaïne, fluorure, chloride and propranolol differential inhibition. The frequency and significance of the various phenotypes is discussed.
Exposure to traffic-related particulate matter (PM) has been associated with adverse respiratory health outcomes in children. Diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) are a local driver of urban fine PM [aerodynamic diameter < or = 2.5 microm (PM(2.5))]; however, evidence linking ambient DEP exposure to acute respiratory symptoms is relatively sparse, and susceptibilities of urban and asthmatic children are inadequately characterized.
We examined associations of daily ambient black carbon (BC) concentrations, a DEP indicator, with daily respiratory symptoms among asthmatic and nonasthmatic adolescents in New York City (NYC) and a nearby suburban community.
BC and PM(2.5) were monitored continuously outside three NYC high schools and one suburban high school for 4-6 weeks, and daily symptom data were obtained from 249 subjects (57 asthmatics, 192 nonasthmatics) using diaries. Associations between pollutants and symptoms were characterized using multilevel generalized linear mixed models, and modification by urban residence and asthma status were examined.
Increases in BC were associated with increased wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Multiple lags of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) exposure were associated with symptoms. For several symptoms, associations with BC and NO(2) were significantly larger in magnitude among urban subjects and asthmatics compared with suburban subjects and nonasthmatics, respectively. PM(2.5) was not consistently associated with increases in symptoms.
Acute exposures to traffic-related pollutants such as DEPs and/or NO(2) may contribute to increased respiratory morbidity among adolescents, and urban residents and asthmatics may be at increased risk. The findings provide support for developing additional strategies to reduce diesel emissions further, especially in populations susceptible because of environment or underlying respiratory disease.
Nerve conduction studies of the ulnar, median, posterior tibial, peroneal and sural nerves were performed in 21 epileptic children aged 6 to 17 years on long-term phenytoin therapy. Auditory brain stem evoked responses were obtained in 16 patients to evaluate the effect of phenytoin on central nervous system synapses. Of the 21 patients examined, 15 (71.4%) showed abnormal findings. The most frequent abnormality was slowed motor conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve (33.3%) and posterior tibial nerve (23.8%), followed by slowed sensory conduction velocity of the sural nerve (20%), lowered H/M ratio (14.3%), slowed motor conduction velocity of the peroneal nerve (14.3%) and of the median nerve (14.2%). A significant correlation was noted between the total dosage and duration of therapy with PHT and the reduction of motor conduction velocity in the posterior tibial nerve. Auditory brain stem evoked responses showed no significant differences in each peak latency between the patients and the normal control group. The study indicates that long-term phenytoin therapy can cause latent impairment of peripheral nerve function in children with no clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy.
We studied the expression of adhesion molecules on infiltrating leukocytes and tubular cells in chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) nephrosis. Rats received injections of PA (2 mg/100 g body wt) weekly for the first 3 weeks and every other week thereafter. Rats were killed at 0, 3, 5, 8, and 12 weeks after the start of injections. From the third to the fifth week, the initial infiltrating cells in interstitial tissue were mainly CD4+ T lymphocytes. At the fifth week, ICAM-1, CD44, and hyaluronate were expressed on infiltrating cells in interstitial tissue. At the eighth week, the number of infiltrating cells reached a peak and consisted of T lymphocytes (CD4, CD8) and macrophages (ED1, MHC class II, CD11b, and CD18). The severity of interstitial infiltration was correlated with the degree of proteinuria and with ICAM-1 expression. Our results suggest that CD4+ T lymphocytes may contribute to the production of initial tubular injury. Expression of ICAM-1 helps mononuclear cells migrate to the interstitium. In addition, expression of CD44 and hyaluronate may play important roles in the chronicity of tubulointerstitial nephritis.
Two schizophrenic patients, who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with risperidone. They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone. This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as "flashbacks" related to prior LSD consumption. Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off. During a six-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of visual disturbances. This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign, short-term and self-limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment. Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution.
The development of a microcomputer-based device permits quick, simple, and noninvasive quantification of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during quiet breathing.
We prospectively and serially measured the radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction and the RSA amplitude in 34 cancer patients receiving up to nine monthly bolus treatments with doxorubicin hydrochloride (60 mg/m2). Of the eight patients who ultimately developed symptomatic doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure, seven (87.5%) demonstrated a significant decline in RSA amplitude; five of 26 subjects without clinical symptoms of cardiotoxicity (19.2%) showed a similar RSA amplitude decline. On average, significant RSA amplitude decline occurred 3 months before the last planned doxorubicin dose in patients destined to develop clinical congestive heart failure.
Overall, RSA amplitude abnormality proved to be a more specific predictor of clinically significant congestive heart failure than did serial resting radionuclide ejection fractions.
Seven subjects with Kallmann's syndrome were studied to determine whether they had disturbances of fluid homeostasis. Simultaneous measurements of urine and plasma osmolality (Uosm and Posm, respectively) were made during free access to fluids. The Uosm-Posm relationship was abnormal in five patients on at least one occasion. Patient 2 was frequently overhydrated (Posm less than or equal to 280 mosmol/kg) and patient 5 excreted a dilute urine when his Posm was 290 mosmol/kg. The three subjects (1, 5, and 7) tending to have an increased Psom (greater than or equal to 300 mosmol/kg) were able to concentrate their urine (Uosm greater than 800 mosmol/kg) and denied polyuria and polydipsia. Their elevated Posms could be explained by impairment of thirst, rather than increased excretion of water, because the patients concentrated their urines at normal Posms during fluid deprivation. The osmotic threshold for vasopressin release was decreased (Posm = 270.6 mosmol/kg) in one patient and increased (Posm greater than or equal to 295 mosmol/kg) in two others of the seven patients. The elevated osmotic threshold was not due to chronic hyperosmolality or a generalized defect in vasopressin secretion. In the patient with the highest osmotic threshold (Posm = 296 mosmol/kg) and Posms between 289--301 mosmol/kg during free access to fluid, the osmotic threshold decreased to only 293 mosmol/kg after 6 weeks of adequate hydration and desmopressin acetate. However, in response to hypotension induced by trimethaphan, he increased his plasma vasopressin from 1--26 microU/ml. In conclusion, some patients with Kallmann's syndrome may have osmoreceptor dysfunction and abnormal thirst regulation, indicating more extensive hypothalamic involvement than previously appreciated.
Axonal neurofilament (NF) accumulations occur before development of symptoms and before other pathological changes among idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases and toxic neuropathies, suggesting a cause-effect relationship. The dependence of symptoms and axonal degeneration on neurofilament accumulation has been tested here in a transgenic mouse model (Eyer and Peterson, 1994) lacking axonal NFs and using two prototypic toxicant models. Chronic acrylamide (ACR) or 2,5-hexanedione exposure resulted in progressive and cumulative increases in sensorimotor deficits. Neurobehavioral tests demonstrated similar expression of neurotoxicity in transgenic (T) mice and their nontransgenic (NT) littermates (containing normal numbers of axonal NFs). Axonal lesions were frequently observed after exposure to either toxicant. Quantitation of ACR-induced lesions demonstrated the distal location of pathology and equal susceptibility of T and NT axons. We conclude that axonal NFs have no effect on neurotoxicity and the pattern of pathology in these mammalian toxic neuropathies. These results also suggest that the role of neurofilament accumulation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases requires careful evaluation.
Beneficial effects of green tea polyphenols (GTP) against obesity have been reported, however, the mechanism of this protection is not clear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify GTP-targeted genes in obesity using the high-fat-diet-induced obese rat model. A total of three groups (n = 12/group) of Sprague Dawley (SD) female rats were tested, including the control group (rats fed with low-fat diet), the HF group (rats fed with high-fat diet), and the HF+GTP group (rats fed with high-fat diet and GTP in drinking water). The HF group increased body weight as compared to the control group. Supplementation of GTP in the drinking water in the HF+GTP group reduced body weight as compared to the HF group. RNA from liver samples was extracted for gene expression analysis. A total of eighty-four genes related to obesity were analyzed using PCR array. Compared to the rats in the control group, the rats in the HF group had the expression levels of 12 genes with significant changes, including 3 orexigenic genes (Agrp, Ghrl, and Nr3c1); 7 anorectic genes (Apoa4, Cntf, Ghr, IL-1β, Ins1, Lepr, and Sort); and 2 genes that relate to energy expenditure (Adcyap1r1 and Adrb1). Intriguingly, the HF+GTP group restored the expression levels of these genes in the high-fat-induced obese rats. The protein expression levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the serum samples from the control, HF, and HF+GTP groups confirmed the results of gene expression. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) also showed GTP-regulated protective changes in this obese rat model. Collectively, this study revealed the beneficial effects of GTP on body weight via regulating obesity-related genes, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant capacity, and estrogen-related actions in high-fat-induced obese rats.
Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) is a congenital disorder of spinal segmentation distinguished by the bony fusion of anterior/cervical vertebrae. Scoliosis, mirror movements, otolaryngological, kidney, ocular, cranial, limb, and/or digit anomalies are often associated. Here we report mutations at the GDF6 gene locus in familial and sporadic cases of KFS including the recurrent missense mutation of an extremely conserved residue c.866T>C (p.Leu289Pro) in association with mirror movements and an inversion breakpoint downstream of the gene in association with carpal, tarsal, and vertebral fusions. GDF6 is expressed at the boundaries of the developing carpals, tarsals, and vertebrae and within the adult vertebral disc. GDF6 knockout mice are best distinguished by fusion of carpals and tarsals and GDF6 knockdown in Xenopus results in a high incidence of anterior axial defects consistent with a role for GDF6 in the etiology, diversity, and variability of KFS.
Kothala himbutu (Salacia reticulata) is a medicinal plant that has been used in Ayurvedic system of Indian and Sri Lankan traditional medicine to treat diabetes.
This study aimed to clarify the mechanism(s) by which aqueous extracts of Kothala himbutu (KTE) stems decreases fasting blood glucose levels.
Gene expression profiles were assessed by DNA microarray and RT-PCR analyses of RNA from the liver of KK-Ay diabetic mice administered KTE or control distilled water for 4 weeks, and from cultured liver cells treated with freeze-dried KTE (KTED) or selected phenolic compounds.
DNA microarray and RT-PCR analyses revealed that gluconeogenic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP) was decreased compared with the control in KTE-treated KK-Ay mice. RT-PCR analysis using cultured liver cells treated with KTED and/or actinomycin D or cycloheximide, revealed that KTED directly decreased FBP mRNA levels via destabilization of the mRNA. One compound in KTE, mangiferin, was demonstrated to dose-dependently down-regulate FBP mRNA.
These findings suggest that the mangiferin in KTE acts directly on liver cells and down-regulates the gluconeogenic pathway through regulation of FBP expression, thereby decreasing fasting blood glucose levels in mice. Our results demonstrate that gluconeogenic gene regulation is one possible mechanism by which KT exerts its effects in traditional diabetic medicine.
The relative toxicities of amantadine and rimantadine were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving healthy adults. In separate studies, drugs were administered at a dosage of 200 mg/day (52 volunteers) or 300 mg/day (196 volunteers) for 4.5 days. Both drugs were well tolerated at the lower dosage. At 300 mg/day amantadine recipients had a greater frequency and severity of central nervous system (nervousness, lightheadedness, difficulty concentrating) and sleep (insomnia, fatigue) complaints compared with rimantadine or placebo recipients. Amantadine recipients also performed less well on an objective test measuring sustained attention and problem-solving ability. Both amantadine and rimantadine recipients reported adverse gastrointestinal symptoms more often than placebo recipients. Because of better tolerance at higher dosage, rimantadine offers more promise than amantadine for treatment of influenza A virus infections.
The protective effects of selected anesthetic regimens on sarin (GB) were investigated in domestic swine. At 30% oxygen, the toxicity of this agent in isoflurane anesthetized animals (LD(50)=10.1μg/kg) was similar to literature sited values in awake swine (LD(50)=11.8μg/kg) and slightly higher than that of both ketamine (LD(50)=15.6μg/kg) and propofol (LD(50)=15.3μg/kg) anesthetized swine. Use of 100% oxygen in ketamine anesthetized animals resulted in three-fold protective effects compared to 30% oxygen. Use of 100% oxygen in both isoflurane and propofol anesthetized animals, compared to 30% resulted in profound protection against GB poisoning (>33×). There were no differences in the severity of the poisoning or recovery time in animals treated over dose ranges of 10-350μg/kg (isoflurane) or 15-500μg/kg GB (propofol). Survivors of high GB challenges that were revived from propofol anesthetic exhibited no signs of cognitive impairment seven days later. Protective treatments did not attenuate cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition; survivors of otherwise supralethal GB concentrations exhibited very low blood ChE activities. This work indicates that propofol has protective effects against GB, and that oxygen tension may have an important role in treating nerve agent casualties. More importantly, it demonstrates that non-cholinergic protective mechanisms exist that may be exploited in the future development of medical countermeasures against organophosphorous nerve agents.
Cardiac mitochondrial damage plays an important role in the pathology of myocardial infarction. The protective effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction were evaluated in rats. Rats were pretreated with (-) epicatechin (20 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 21 days. After the pretreatment period, isoproterenol (100 mg/kg body weight) was injected subcutaneously into rats twice at an interval of 24 h to induce myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats showed a significant increase in the levels of cardiac diagnostic markers, heart mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, calcium, and a significant decrease in the activities/levels of heart mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione, isocitrate, succinate, malate, α-ketoglutarate and NADH-dehydrogenases, cytochrome-C-oxidase and adenosine triphosphate. (-) Epicatechin pretreatment showed significant protective effects on all the biochemical parameters evaluated. The in vitro study revealed the superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of (-) epicatechin. The possible mechanisms for the beneficial effects of (-) epicatechin on cardiac mitochondria could be attributed to scavenging of free radicals, decreasing calcium, increasing multi-enzymes (antioxidant, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain enzymes), reduced glutathione and adenosine triphosphate. Thus, (-) epicatechin attenuated mitochondrial damage in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats.
No reliable treatment to reverse severe ergot-induced vasopasm is available. A case of ergotamine-induced vasospasm of the lower extremities is presented. A combined treatment of vasodilators, infusion of low molecular dextran and high epidural anaesthesia apparently prevented extremity gangrene from occurring.
