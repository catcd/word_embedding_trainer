Experiments were carried out on the rabbits of New Zealand breed weighting about 3 kg. Rabbits from the experimental group received Cladribine in the dose of 0.07 mg/kg/24 h each morning subcutaneously for 6 days, three cycles with 5-week intervals. Specimens of the optic nerve were stained according to the Reynold's method and observed in Tesla BS-500 transmission electron microscope. Results achieved from examinations of slides in experimental group indicate that Cladribine administered in the dose corresponding to therapeutic dose used in humans for experimental treatment of sclerosis multiplex does not cause the damage of extrabulbar segment of optic nerve in experimental animals. The achieved results suggest necessity of new research works regarding the eye structures of mesenchymal origin.
Whereas amphetamine and other psychostimulants primarily act on the dopamine system, there is also evidence that other neurotransmitter systems, such as the endogenous opioid system, modulate psychostimulant-induced effects. Several studies have investigated the role of opioid antagonists on cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), but there is limited information about the interaction with amphetamines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (NTX) on the conditioning, expression and reinstatement of amphetamine-induced place preference. In addition, the effect of NTX on locomotor behaviour was measured during all sessions. During training, animals were conditioned with amphetamine (2 mg/kg) to induce place preference. In order to extinguish the conditioned behaviour, animals received saline for 12 days. Reinstatement of CPP was induced by a priming dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). The interaction of NTX and amphetamine was evaluated using three paradigms of CPP: with NTX (vehicle, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) administered either 30 minutes prior to amphetamine conditioning, or 30 minutes before the expression, or 30 minutes before the amphetamine priming to induce reinstatement. Naltrexone had no effect on the conditioning, the expression or the reinstatement induced by a priming dose of amphetamine. Further, NTX by itself did not induce place preference or place aversion. In contrast, NTX significantly attenuated the locomotor response to a priming dose of amphetamine without affecting general locomotor behaviour. The results suggest differences in opioid modulation of amphetamine-induced behaviours in the rat.
Rieger syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder, includes ocular, craniofacial and umbilical abnormalities. The pitx2 homeobox gene, which is mutated in Rieger syndrome, has been proposed to be the effector molecule interpreting left-right axial information from the early embryonic trunk to each organ. Here we have used gene targeting in mice to generate a loss-of-function allele that would be predicted to result in organ randomization or isomerization. Although pitx2-/- embryos had abnormal cardiac morphogenesis, mutant hearts looped in the normal direction. Pitx2-/- embryos had correctly oriented, but arrested, embryonic rotation and right pulmonary isomerism. They also had defective development of the mandibular and maxillary facial prominences, regression of the stomodeum and arrested tooth development. Fgf8 expression was absent, and Bmp4 expression was expanded in the branchial-arch ectoderm. These data reveal a critical role for pitx2 in left-right asymmetry but indicate that pitx2 may function at an intermediate step in cardiac morphogenesis and embryonic rotation.
The effect of DSP-4 [N-/2-chloroethyl/-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine] upon blood pressure and of clonidine hypotension before and after bicuculline treatment were studied in rats. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were injected with DSP-4 at the dose of 50 mg/kg i.p. twice. Clonidine was given i.p. at the dose of 10 microg/kg in SHR and 20 microg/kg in WKY at the 7th, 9th and 15th day after DSP-4 administration. Bicuculline was injected at the dose of 1mg/kg i.p. The blood pressure and clonidine hypotension appeared unaffected by DSP-4 pretreatment in WKY and SHR rats. In both rat strains the bicuculline reduced clonidine hypotension and the phenomenon was augmented after DSP-4 lesioning. The data suggest that the alterations in GABAergic and other neurotransmitter system function evoke increasing effect of bicuculline.
Resveratrol (trans-3,4'-trihydroxystilbene), a natural phytoalexin, possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and immunomodulatory properties and has the potential for treating inflammatory disorders. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on TNF-α-induced inflammatory cytokines production of IL-1β and MMP3 in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and further to explore the role of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by which resveratrol modulates those cytokines production. The levels of IL-1β, MMP-3 in cultural supernatants among groups were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Messenger RNA expression of IL-1β and MMP-3 in RA FLS was analyzed using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Western blot analysis was used to detect proteins expression in RA FLS intervened by resveratrol. Resveratrol inhibited both mRNA and proteins expressions of IL-1β and MMP-3 on RA FLS in a dose-dependent manner. Resveratrol also decreased significantly the expression of phosphorylated Akt dose dependently. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway exists in TNF-α-induced production of IL-1β and MMP3 on RA FLS, which is hampered by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Immunofluorescence staining showed that TNF-α alone increased the production of P-Akt, whereas LY294002 and 50 μM resveratrol suppressed the TNF-α-stimulated expression of P-Akt. Resveratrol attenuates TNF-α-induced production of IL-1β and MMP-3 via inhibition of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in RA FLS, suggesting that resveratrol plays an anti-inflammatory role and might have beneficial effects in preventing and treating RA.
The teratogenic potential of a combination of chlordiazepoxide (Cdz) and amitriptyline (Amt) was examined with regard to both internal and external anomalies. Timed pregnant golden hamsters were given a single intraperitoneal injection on day 8 of gestation of one of the following: chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (28.5 mg/kg), amitriptyline hydrochloride (70.3 mg/kg), Cdz-Amt combination (28.5 mg/kg Cdz + 70.3 mg/kg Amt, in order to retain the 1:2.5 dose ratio utilized in a clinically-used preparation of these agents), or saline vehicle (control). Fetuses were recovered on gestation day 15 following maternal sacrifice. Cranial malformations were analyzed in Bouin's-fixed fetuses by making 1-mm coronal sections through each head, whereas visceral anomalies were examined following general dissection of each body. Amt alone produced a significant (P less than 0.05) incidence of bent tail and encephalocele, whereas Cdz significantly (P less than 0.05) altered the male:female ratio of surviving fetuses when compared with saline-injected controls. The Cdz-Amt combination caused significant increases in cranial malformations, open eye, bent tail, abnormal lung, and urogenital anomalies. The teratogenic effects of potentiation between the components of this combination are discussed in terms of external and internal malformations.
Naproxen and cromolyn were investigated as new inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in an attempt to explain their hypoglycemic properties. Study included simulated docking experiments, in vitro enzyme inhibition assay, and in vivo validations. Both drugs not only were optimally fitted within a GSK-3β binding pocket via several attractive interactions with key amino acids but also exhibited potent in vitro enzymatic inhibitory activities of IC50 1.5 and 2.0 µM for naproxen and cromolyn, respectively. In vivo experiments illustrated that both drugs significantly reduced serum glucose and increased hepatic glycogen- and serum insulin levels in normal and type II diabetic Balb/c mice models. In obese animal model, both drugs exhibited significant reduction in mice weights, serum glucose, and resistin levels along with significant elevation in serum insulin, C-peptide, and adiponectin values. It can be concluded that naproxen and cromolyn are novel GSK-3β inhibitors and can help in management of diabetes and obesity.
A classical F2 and backcross genetic design was used to examine the relationship between sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures and hippocampal nicotinic receptors. Nicotine was administered by i.v. infusion through cannulas implanted in the right jugular veins of mice from the C3H and DBA mouse strains and their derived F1, F2 and backcross (F1 X C3H and F1 X DBA) generations. Nicotine-induced seizure sensitivity was assessed by infusing nicotine at a 2.0 mg/kg/min concentration until the onset of a clonic seizure. After seizure testing, mice were sacrificed and the binding of alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX) was determined in three brain regions: cortex, midbrain and hippocampus. The pattern of results for the six generations for seizure sensitivity was similar to that observed for hippocampal BTX binding. Genetic analyses indicate that receptor concentrations in the hippocampus and seizure sensitivity are both influenced by a relatively simple genetic system which involves one or more genes acting in an additive fashion. In addition, the genetic correlation which is indicative of the extent to which two characters are influenced by the same genes, supports the relationship between nicotine-induced seizure sensitivity and hippocampal BTX binding. The results suggest that those animals which are sensitive to nicotine-induced seizures have a greater concentration of nicotinic receptors as determined by the binding of BTX than animals which are less sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine.
One of the major side effects of the combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C is ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia. Little is known about variables influencing this anemia. Our study tried to search for these variables in a large group of patients with hepatitis C treated with the combination therapy.
Two hundred and forty-four patients chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus were treated either with induction treatment (daily dose of interferon) or with a standard treatment (interferon thrice weekly). Both groups received 1,000-1,200 mg of ribavirin from week 4 until the end of the treatment. The drop in hemoglobin level was defined as the difference between the pretreatment hemoglobin level and the hemoglobin level at week 8. Seventeen variables which could possibly influence this drop in hemoglobin level were examined.
After multivariate analysis, the drop in hemoglobin level was only significant influenced by pretreatment platelet level, treatment and haptoglobin phenotype. The ribavirin dose did not influence the drop in hemoglobin level or the early virological response.
Ribavirin-induced hemolysis is influenced by the pretreatment platelet level, the administered amount of alpha-interferon and the haptoglobin phenotype. A careful search for the minimal dose of ribavirin needed in combination treatment is necessary.
Torsade de pointes is a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia that is associated with prolonged QT intervals and is often caused by drugs that prolong repolarization. Among the most common drugs that may cause torsade de pointes are antiarrhythmic drugs including quinidine, procainamide, sotalol and newer class III antiarrhythmic agents. The incidence of torsade de pointes associated with amiodarone, however, is reported to be much lower. A case is reported of amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes following the development of the same arrhythmia during beta-blocker use. This case illustrates that although the reported incidence of torsade de pointes during amiodarone therapy is low, patients with bradycardia-induced torsade de pointes may be a subgroup of patients who are at increased risk of this arrhythmia with amiodarone.
Over the past several decades there has been a remarkable reduction in environmental sources of lead, improved protection from occupational lead exposure, and an overall decreasing trend in the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in U.S. adults. As a result, the U.S. national BLL geometric mean among adults was 1.2 µg/dL during 2009-2010. Nonetheless, lead exposures continue to occur at unacceptable levels. Current research continues to find that BLLs previously considered harmless can have harmful effects in adults, such as decreased renal function and increased risk for hypertension and essential tremor at BLLs <10 µg/dL. CDC has designated 10 µg/dL as the reference BLL for adults; levels ≥10 µg/dL are considered elevated. CDC's Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program tracks elevated BLLs among adults in the United States. In contrast to the CDC reference level, prevailing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standards allow workers removed from lead exposure to return to lead work when their BLL falls below 40 µg/dL. During 2002-2011, ABLES identified 11,536 adults with very high BLLs (≥40 µg/dL). Persistent very high BLLs (≥40 µg/dL in ≥2 years) were found among 2,210 (19%) of these adults. Occupational exposures accounted for 7,076 adults with very high BLLs (91% of adults with known exposure source) and 1,496 adults with persistent very high BLLs. Adverse health effects associated with very high BLLs underscore the need for increased efforts to prevent lead exposure at workplaces and in communities.
Numerous epidemiological studies have shown an association between pesticide exposure and increased risk of developing Parkinson's diseases. Oxidative stress generated as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as an important factor in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. Previously, we reported that chronic dichlorvos exposure causes mitochondrial impairments and nigrostriatal neuronal death in rats. The present study was designed to test whether Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) administration has any neuroprotective effect against dichlorvos mediated nigrostriatal neuronal death, α-synuclein aggregation, and motor dysfunction. Male albino rats were administered dichlorvos by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight over a period of 12 weeks. Results obtained there after showed that dichlorvos exposure leads to enhanced mitochondrial ROS production, α-synuclein aggregation, decreased dopamine and its metabolite levels resulting in nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. Pretreatment by Coenzyme Q(10) (4.5 mg/kg ip for 12 weeks) to dichlorvos treated animals significantly attenuated the extent of nigrostriatal neuronal damage, in terms of decreased ROS production, increased dopamine and its metabolite levels, and restoration of motor dysfunction when compared to dichlorvos treated animals. Thus, the present study shows that Coenzyme Q(10) administration may attenuate dichlorvos induced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, α-synuclein aggregation and motor dysfunction by virtue of its antioxidant action.
Nicotine, a major component of tobacco, is partly responsible for the development of atherosclerosis. It has been suggested that antioxidant nutrients are protective against degenerative diseases. So we have studied the antioxidant effect of oils isolated from onion and garlic on nicotine-induced lipid peroxidation in rat tissues. The lipid peroxidation products and scavenging enzymes were assessed in liver, lungs, heart and kidney. The rats were treated with 0.6 mg nicotine/kg bw and simultaneously given 100 mg garlic or onion oils/kg bw for 21 d. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, conjugated dienes and hydroperoxides concentrations were significantly increased in the tissues of nicotine-treated rats. Both the garlic oil and onion oil supplementation to nicotine-treated rats increased resistance to lipid peroxidation. The activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase decreased in nicotine-treated rats, but there was a trend to increased glutathione content. With garlic oil or onion oil supplementation, nicotine-treated rats had increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased concentrations of glutathione. These results indicate that oils of garlic and onion are effective antioxidants against the oxidative damage caused by nicotine.
We studied the antioxidative role of melatonin against benzene toxicity in rat liver. The inhibition of mitochondrial and microsomal lipid peroxidation differed between 24-hour (single-dose), 15-day, and 30-day treatments. Inhibition of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation was the highest after the single dose of melatonin, whereas highest microsomal inhibition was recorded after 30 days of melatonin treatment. No significant difference was recorded between 15-day and 30-day treatments. Cytochrome P 4502E1 (CYP 4502E1) activity declined after the single-dose and 15-day melatonin treatment in the benzene-treated group, but it rose again, though not significantly after 30 days of treatment. Liver histopathology generally supported these findings. Phenol concentration in the urine samples declined in melatonin and benzene-treated rats. Our results show that melatonin affects CYP 4502E1, which is responsible for benzene metabolism. Inhibition of its metabolism correlated with lower lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, melatonin was found to be protective against lipid peroxidation induced by benzene.
Accumulation of lipids and cholesterol by macrophages and subsequent transformation into foam cells are key features in development of atherosclerosis. Serum copper concentrations have been shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanism behind the proatherogenic effect of copper is not clear. We used DNA microarrays to define the changes in gene expression profile in response to copper exposure of human macrophages. Expression monitoring by DNA microarray revealed 91 genes that were regulated. Copper increased the expression of seven cholesterogenic genes (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) synthase, IPP isomerase, squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase, methyl sterol oxidase, H105e3 mRNA and sterol-C5-desaturase) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), and decreased the expression of CD36 and lipid binding proteins. The expression of LDL-R and HMG CoA reductase was also investigated using real time PCR. The expression of both of these genes was increased after copper treatment of macrophages (P<0.01 and P<0.01, respectively). We conclude that copper activates cholesterogenic genes in macrophages, which may provide a mechanism for the association between copper and atherosclerosis. The effect of copper on cholesterogenic genes may also have implications for liver steatosis in early stages of Wilson's disease.
Sustained high levels of circulating catecholamines may result in cardiotoxicity. Although cardiotoxicity could occur primarily via adrenoceptor activation, there is increasing evidence that it may also occur through oxidative mechanisms. In fact, catecholamines can be converted into aminochromes by auto-oxidation, enzymatically or metal catalyzed, with the concomitant production of reactive intermediates and free radicals. Nevertheless, there is only scarce information concerning the effects of the catecholamine oxidation process on isolated cardiomyocytes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the cardiotoxic effects of isoproterenol (ISO) and its oxidation process in freshly isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes by assessing the cell shape, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, reduced and oxidized glutathione content, and glutathione reductase, peroxidase, and transferase activities. ISO was incubated at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM in cardiomyocyte suspensions at subphysiological and physiological Ca2+ concentrations for 4 h. The same study was repeated in the presence of 20 microM of Cu2+. The levels of ISO in the incubation medium were monitored throughout the assays. Isoproterenol (1 mM) induced both glutathione oxidation and conjugation, but this effect decreased at subphysiological Ca2+ concentrations. The concomitant incubation with Cu2+ increased ISO oxidation and increased the glutathione oxidation but decreased the extent of glutathione conjugation. Although only a partial ISO oxidation was observed for all studied ISO concentrations in the presence of copper, the underlying oxidative process or its oxidation products, or both, were sufficient to induce a loss of cardiomyocyte viability and a decrease in the glutathione reductase, peroxidase, and transferase activities. Thus, the results suggest that the oxidation of catecholamines could be a major mechanism for catecholamine-induced cardiotoxicity.
The antimigraine drugs ergotamine and sumatriptan may cause angina-like symptoms, possibly resulting from coronary artery constriction. We compared the coronary vasoconstrictor potential of a number of current and prospective antimigraine drugs (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, methysergide and its metabolite methylergometrine, sumatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, avitriptan).
Concentration-response curves to the antimigraine drugs were constructed in human isolated coronary artery segments to obtain the maximum contractile response (Emax) and the concentration eliciting 50% of Emax (EC50). The EC50 values were related to maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported in patients, obtaining Cmax/EC50 ratios as an index of coronary vasoconstriction occurring in the clinical setting. Furthermore, we studied the duration of contractile responses after washout of the acutely acting antimigraine drugs to assess their disappearance from the receptor biophase. Compared with sumatriptan, all drugs were more potent (lower EC50 values) in contracting the coronary artery but had similar efficacies (Emax <25% of K+-induced contraction). The Cmax of avitriptan was 7- to 11-fold higher than its EC50 value, whereas those of the other drugs were <40% of their respective EC50 values. The contractile responses to ergotamine and dihydroergotamine persisted even after repeated washings, but those to the other drugs declined rapidly after washing.
All current and prospective antimigraine drugs contract the human coronary artery in vitro, but in view of low efficacy, these drugs are unlikely to cause myocardial ischemia at therapeutic plasma concentrations in healthy subjects. In patients with coronary artery disease, however, these drugs must remain contraindicated. The sustained contraction by ergotamine and dihydroergotamine seems to be an important disadvantage compared with sumatriptan-like drugs.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) has been associated with a variety of infective as well as non-infective causes. HUS as a toxic manifestation of exposure to herbicides/pesticides has not been reported so far in literature. We report a subject who presented with clinical features of features of HUS after intentional suicidal ingestion of the herbicidal agent monochloroacetic acid (MCA). A 55-year-old farmer was admitted with a history of consumption of monochloroacetic acid with vomiting, hematochezia and oligo-anuria. Our investigations revealed severe renal failure, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia with evidence of intravascular hemolysis. He was treated for HUS with plasma transfusions and haemodialysis in view of renal failure. During the course of hospital admission he developed acute antero-septal myocardial infarction and subsequently succumbed to the disease. MCA is used as an herbicidal agent and also a bleaching agent for silkworm cocoons. The toxicity of MCA has included metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis and renal failure; however HUS has not been described in the literature. Extra -renal manifestations of HUS such as cardiomyopathy have also been infrequently described. This case is presented to highlight an as yet unknown toxicity of MCA.
The effect of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, injected into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus on drug-induced (apomorphine, oxytocin and NMDA) yawning and penile erection, and on the increase in the concentration of NO2- and NO3- occurring in the paraventricular dialysate in these experimental conditions, was studied in male rats. Muscimol (50, 100 and 200 ng) reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, penile erection and yawning induced by apomorphine (50 ng), oxytocin (30 ng) and NMDA (50 ng) delivered into the PVN. The reduction of penile erection and yawning was parallel to a reduction of the concomitant NO2- and NO3- increase that occurs in the paraventricular dialysate in this experimental condition. In contrast, baclofen (200 ng), a GABAB receptor agonist, was ineffective. The muscimol effects on drug-induced penile erection, yawning and NO2- increase were prevented by the prior administration of bicuculline (250 ng into the paraventricular nucleus). Muscimol (200 ng) but not baclofen (200 ng), injected into the PVN, reduced both noncontact erections in male rats placed in the presence of an inaccessible receptive female, and also the NO2- increase that occurs in the paraventricular dialysate in this experimental condition. As found with drug-induced penile erection, the muscimol reduction of noncontact erections and of NO2- increase was prevented by bicuculline. The present results show that the activation of GABAA receptors in the PVN reduces yawning and penile erection induced by drugs or physiological stimuli by reducing the increase in NO activity that occurs in this hypothalamic nucleus in these experimental conditions.
We experienced two cases of circulatory failure after local infiltration of 0.0005% epinephrine solution for the purpose of prophylactic hemostasis during tonsillectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia. Case 1: A 14 year-old girl developed ventricular bigeminy, tachycardia and hypertension following infiltration of the epinephrine solution 6ml around the tonsil. Sinus rhythm returned with intravenous lidocaine 40 mg and propranolol 0.4 mg. However, the patient showed gradually decreasing heart rate, depressed ST segments and inverted T waves and poor peripheral circulation. Her blood pressure decreased abruptly at the same time and finally the pulsation of the radial and femoral arteries was not palpable. She was treated with intravenous ephedrine in vain. Therefore, she received intravenous epinephrine and cardiac massage, and then recovered from the circulatory failure with her ECG showing normal sinus rhythms. Emergence from the anesthesia was smooth. Her cardiac failure may have been caused by the decreasing cardiac contraction and the increasing afterload due to the vasoconstriction after the intravenous beta-blocker. Case 2: An eleven year-old boy showed ventricular tachycardia and hypertension after infiltration of the epinephrine solution 11.5 ml around the tonsil. Lidocaine was given intravenously. This restored sinus rhythm but the ST segments on his ECG were elevated. ST segments became normalized after intravenous nitroglycerin. However, pulmonary edema developed suddenly, and it was cured by intensive treatment. His ventricular tachycardia and hypertension after the local administration of epinephrine were presumably responsible for the acute heart failure causing the pulmonary edema. Our experience suggests that the maintenance of cardiac function and the reduction of afterload are important to overcome the circulatory disaster following the local infiltration of epinephrine.
Combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy with estramustine phosphate (EMP), a nornitrogen mustard-estrogen conjugate, are used to treat patients with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma (HRPC). However, thromboembolic events (TE), including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, myocardial infarction, and arterial thrombosis, are significant toxicities of these regimens. The current study sought to establish the rate of TE and to determine risk factors for TE.
A MEDLINE-based search identified EMP-based clinical trials published in the English-language peer-reviewed literature after 1990 in which > or = 20 patients with HRPC were enrolled and TE were clearly documented. Patient characteristics and the dose of EMP given were analyzed to determine their association with the rate of TE.
Twenty-three studies, enrolling a total of 896 patients, were included in the analysis. The overall risk of TE was 0.07 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.05-0.11). The risk of DVT was 0.06 (95% CI, 0.04-0.09). The risks of all other types of TE were <0.01. Using univariate logistic regression analysis, the dose of EMP administered, baseline patient age, and baseline prostate-specific antigen level were not found to be associated with the total risk of TE. The rates of total TE and DVT may be inflated because one of the analyzed studies initially had a very high rate of DVT (25%) when compared with the others.
The rate of TE in men with HRPC who are treated with EMP-based regimens is significant, but it does not appear to be related to the dose of EMP. Whether TE can be prevented with anticoagulant prophylaxis remains to be determined.
To compare the effects on renal function of captopril and enalapril in elderly patients with chronic heart failure.
A multi-centre double-blind parallel-group comparison of the two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, captopril (12.5 mg bid) and enalapril (2.5 mg bid).
80 elderly patients with chronic heart failure (41 in the captopril group, 39 in the enalapril group).
The blood pressure and pulse rate response to the first dose of ACE inhibitor was assessed in all patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured radioisotopically by 99mTcDTPA or 51CrEDTA clearance after three and six months of each treatment. Subgroups were assessed for effective renal plasma flow (33 patients), exercise tolerance (25 patients) and by a symptom-oriented questionnaire (45 patients).
No serious adverse effect on GFR was noticed. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in the mean baseline GFR or in changes from baseline at three and six months (captopril mean baseline GFR 49.6 ml min-1 1.76 m-2, enalapril 54.7 ml min-1 1.76 m-2; mean change (95% confidence interval) at three months captopril 12 ml min-1 (+3.0, +21.0), enalapril -2 ml min-1 (-13.0; +9.0); mean change at six months, captopril 3.7 ml min-1 (-6.7; +14.2), enalapril -6.0 ml min-1 (-21.0; +9.4). Significantly more patients given captopril had an improvement in GFR during the study period (26/31 compared with 20/31 enalapril-treated patients at three months, p = 0.0096, and 23/30 compared with 15/27 at six months, p = 0.021). There were no significant changes in effective renal plasma flow. Three patients treated with enalapril developed symptomatic hypotension within three days of starting treatment. Quality of life questionnaires revealed more gastrointestinal symptoms in the enalapril group (p = 0.039).
Captopril seems marginally preferable to enalapril in the treatment of chronic heart failure in elderly patients.
Prolonged and sustained consumption of alcohol, heroin and volatiles had been reported to impair hearing. Amphetamine related hearing loss is clinically different from the hearing loss seen with other agents. It seems that illicit drug use could result in two clinically different types of hearing losses. In May and June of 2001, 183 men aged 18 and above who met DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence were studied in a hospital in Saudia Arabia. The purpose of the study was to ascertain the prevalence of amphetamine-related recoverable hearing loss, establish whether similar hearing loss also occurred with other drugs of abuse and determine if drug-related psychosis was more prevalent in those amphetamine users who developed this type of hearing loss. Recoverable type of hearing loss was not just seen in amphetamine users but also occurred with cannabis, heroin, alcohol, dextromethorphan and glue use. Drug-induced psychosis was three and a half times more common in those amphetamine users who developed a hearing loss. Major depression and suicidality was also more common in these individuals. This association of major depression and subsequent development of hearing loss was also found in those using other type of drugs. It was concluded that a history of major depression was a good predictor of later development of both drug-induced psychosis and hearing loss in amphetamine users, and hypoperfusion was proposed as the possible explanation.
Muscle pain is often accompanied by a feeling of muscle fatigue and weakness. We examined the effect of experimental muscle pain on the electromyogram (EMG) during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), and on the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the brachial biceps muscle. Twenty-one healthy subjects were injected intramuscularly with 0.1 ml/30 microg of the vanilloid receptor agonist (capsaicin) or 0.2 ml of 5% hypertonic saline. A Teflon-coated cannulated EMG needle was used to record the EMG interference pattern (IP) at MVC. The CMAP of the brachial biceps muscle was obtained by stimulation of the musculocutaneous nerve at the axilla using surface electrodes. Amplitude, mean frequency of the power spectrum, and turns/s of the interference pattern were reduced after pain induced by capsaicin or hypertonic saline. Latency, amplitude, and area-under-curve of the CMAP did not change after injection of either substance. Acute stimulation of muscle nociceptors thus produced a fatiguelike change in the interference pattern during MVC, possibly due to a decrease in motoneuron firing rate and increased muscle fatigability.
A 37-year-old man with ischaemic finger necrosis and recent-onset Raynaud's phenomenon associated with cocaine abuse is reported. Initial therapy with systemic vasodilators, low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin failed. Resolution of the ischaemia and ulcer healing was rapidly achieved with intravenous infusions of the prostacyclin analogue iloprost. The mechanism of vascular ischaemic injury and the development of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon due to cocaine use is discussed.
A 49-year-old woman presented with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g per dL (95 g/L), reticulocyte count of 6.7 percent (0.067), and hemoglobinuria. The next day, the hemoglobin had dropped to 5.8 g per dL (58 g/L), and total bilirubin was 8.8 mg per dL (150 mumol/L). The serum reacted 2+ with all red cells (RBCs). The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was 3+ with anti-IgG and 1+ with anti-C3, but eluates prepared by two different methods did not react with untreated RBCs. The eluate reacted 2+ with amoxicillin-coated RBCs; amoxicillin had been listed in the patient's record as a previous medication. The patient denied recent ingestion of amoxicillin. Further investigation documented the injection of a dye, fluorescein sodium (AK-FLUOR-25%), for a ophthalmologic fluorescein angiographic study 2 days before admission. RBCs coated with AK-FLUOR reacted with the eluate. Controls consisting of normal serum, an eluate prepared from DAT-negative RBCs, and a serum known to contain anti-penicillin did not react with AK-FLUOR-coated RBCs. Nine days later, the DAT was negative and the serum did not react with untreated RBCs. In the presence of AK-FLUOR (1-in-125) or amoxicillin (1 mg/mL), the serum reacted 2+ in the antiglobulin test. Antibodies to AK-FLUOR and amoxicillin appeared to react by two mechanisms, which is similar to results in recent reports of other drugs associated with hemolytic anemia. AK-FLUOR has not previously been reported to be associated with hemolytic anemia.
