Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are known to produce painful neuropathies and to enhance states of pain hypersensitivity produced by HIV-1 infection. It has also been observed that in some neuropathic pain models, chemokines and their receptors are upregulated, perhaps contributing to the pain state. In order to understand if chemokines are involved in NRTI-mediated sensory neuropathies, we treated rats with the anti-retroviral drug, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), which is known to produce an extended period of hyperalgesia and allodynia. Using in situ hybridization, we observed that under normal conditions, CXCR4 chemokine receptors were widely expressed by satellite glia in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and Schwann cells in the sciatic nerve. A limited number of DRG neurons also expressed CXCR4 receptors. The chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12 was similarly expressed in glial cells in the DRG and peripheral nerve. Following a single administration of ddC, expression levels of CXCR4 mRNA in glia and neurons and SDF-1 mRNA in glia increased considerably. The functional nature of increased CXCR4 mRNA expression was confirmed by measuring SDF-1 induced [Ca2+]i increases in acutely isolated DRG neurons and glia. In contrast, the expression of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 did not change following ddC treatment. Pain hypersensitivity produced by ddC could be inhibited by treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100. Hence, we postulate that NRTIs produce pain hypersensitivity through the upregulation of CXCR4 signaling in the DRG. Increased numbers of CXCR4 receptors would also explain the synergism observed between NRTI treatment and the proalgesic effects of HIV-1 infection.
Nephrolithiasis was present in a 2-month-old premature infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who had been receiving furosemide and intravenous (IV) gluconate calcium therapy. This infant was found to be hypercalciuric. Furosemide therapy is known to increase calcium excretion. In the present study, we examined sick infants who were receiving gluconate calcium without furosemide to evaluate the effect of gluconate calcium therapy on urinary calcium excretion. The sick infants receiving gluconate calcium had higher values of urinary calcium than did the well infants taking regular formula feedings. Moreover, the calciuria appeared to increase progressively with continued gluconate calcium therapy. It appears that prolonged use of either furosemide or IV gluconate calcium leads to hypercalciuria, which, in turn, may predispose the premature infant to nephrolithiasis.
Abnormal epigenetic regulation has been implicated in oncogenesis. We report here the identification of somatic mutations by exome sequencing in acute monocytic leukemia, the M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M5). We discovered mutations in DNMT3A (encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A) in 23 of 112 (20.5%) cases. The DNMT3A mutants showed reduced enzymatic activity or aberrant affinity to histone H3 in vitro. Notably, there were alterations of DNA methylation patterns and/or gene expression profiles (such as HOXB genes) in samples with DNMT3A mutations as compared with those without such changes. Leukemias with DNMT3A mutations constituted a group of poor prognosis with elderly disease onset and of promonocytic as well as monocytic predominance among AML-M5 individuals. Screening other leukemia subtypes showed Arg882 alterations in 13.6% of acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4) cases. Our work suggests a contribution of aberrant DNA methyltransferase activity to the pathogenesis of acute monocytic leukemia and provides a useful new biomarker for relevant cases.
We carried out a genome-wide association study of IgA nephropathy, a major cause of kidney failure worldwide. We studied 1,194 cases and 902 controls of Chinese Han ancestry, with targeted follow up in Chinese and European cohorts comprising 1,950 cases and 1,920 controls. We identified three independent loci in the major histocompatibility complex, as well as a common deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 at chromosome 1q32 and a locus at chromosome 22q12 that each surpassed genome-wide significance (P values for association between 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ and 4.84 × 10⁻⁹ and minor allele odds ratios of 0.63-0.80). These five loci explain 4-7% of the disease variance and up to a tenfold variation in interindividual risk. Many of the alleles that protect against IgA nephropathy impart increased risk for other autoimmune or infectious diseases, and IgA nephropathy risk allele frequencies closely parallel the variation in disease prevalence among Asian, European and African populations, suggesting complex selective pressures.
Deriving No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) or benchmark dose is important for risk assessment and can be influenced by study design considerations. In order to define the di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) dose-response curve for reproductive malformations, we retained more offspring to adulthood to improve detection of these malformations in the reproductive assessment by continuous breeding study design. Sprague-Dawley rats were given a dietary administration of 1.5 (control), 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 7500, and 10,000 ppm DEHP. Male pups were evaluated for gross reproductive tract malformations (RTMs) associated with the "phthalate syndrome." DEHP treatment had minimal effects on P0 males. There was a statistically significant increase in F1 and F2 total RTMs (testis, epididymides, seminal vesicle, and prostate) in the 7500-ppm dose group and F1 10,000-ppm dose group. The 10,000-ppm exposed F1 males did not produce an F2 generation. The NOAEL for F1 and F2 RTM combined data, because in utero exposures were similar, were 100 ppm (4.8 mg/kg/day), which was close to the 5% response benchmark dose lower confidence limit of 142 ppm. The utility of evaluating more pups per litter was examined by generating power curves from a Monte Carlo simulation. These curves indicate a substantial increase in detection rate when three males are evaluated per litter rather than one. A 10% effect across male pups would be detected 5% of the time if one pup per litter was evaluated, but these effects would be detected 66% of the time if three pups per litter were evaluated. Taken together, this study provides a well-defined dose response of DEHP-induced RTMs and demonstrates that retention of more adult F1 and F2 males per litter, animals that were already produced, increases the ability to detect RTMs and presumably other low-incidence phenomena.
Of six patients treated with thalidomide for either prurigo nodularis or discoid lupus erythematosus, four had paresthesias in the hands and feet and one also complained of muscular pain and stiffness. Clinical neurological findings in all four patients were normal. Subsequent electrophysiological examination disclosed a peripheral neuropathy in five of the six patients; two had electrophysiological signs of a polyneuropathy and three of a carpal tunnel syndrome. Symptoms and abnormal electrophysiological findings were still present in one patient one year after the discontinuation of thalidomide therapy. Since reports on thalidomide neurotoxicity have shown that the neurological symptoms are long standing and possibly irreversible, it is obviously important to inform patients of this possible side effect and to evaluate them closely for the symptoms and electrophysiological signs of evolving neurological changes.
Fenofibrate induced myopathy is a rare adverse event. We present a case of muscle pain and quadriparesis following administration of 200mg of fenofibrate for 35 days. Patient gradually improved after stopping the drug. As per our knowledge, this is probably the first case report of fenofibrate induced myopathy from India.
In addition to the HLA locus, six genetic risk factors for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) have been identified in recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To identify additional loci, we carried out a GWAS using 1,840 cases from the UK PBC Consortium and 5,163 UK population controls as part of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 (WTCCC3). We followed up 28 loci in an additional UK cohort of 620 PBC cases and 2,514 population controls. We identified 12 new susceptibility loci (at a genome-wide significance level of P < 5 × 10⁻⁸) and replicated all previously associated loci. We identified three further new loci in a meta-analysis of data from our study and previously published GWAS results. New candidate genes include STAT4, DENND1B, CD80, IL7R, CXCR5, TNFRSF1A, CLEC16A and NFKB1. This study has considerably expanded our knowledge of the genetic architecture of PBC.
Urinary excretion of albumin and retinol-binding protein was measured by means of sensitive and specific immunochemical methods in a transverse study of 20 lithium-treated patients and 24 apparently healthy individuals. Albumin creatinine clearance ratios were significantly higher in the lithium-treated patients, which may indicate glomerular lesions. Microalbuminuria correlated highly to duration of lithium therapy. No significant difference between the retinol-binding protein creatinine clearance ratios in the two groups could be shown. This suggests that the catabolism of low-molecular-mass proteins in the proximal tubules was normal.
The use of haloperidol to induce sedation and control agitation in the acutely ill adult patient has been well documented. There are few reports, however, of the use of this neuroleptic agent to control the severe delirium and agitation that may occur in critically ill pediatric patients or acute pediatric patients suffering from burn wounds. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of the use of haloperidol by completing a retrospective chart review of 855 acutely ill children treated consecutively during the period from April 1999 to May 2002, during which time 26 children received haloperidol. The safe use of haloperidol was assessed by documenting any adverse effects or reactions observed after the administration of the drug. Of patients given haloperidol, 23% had adverse effects. This result suggests that the use of haloperidol to treat the acutely agitated and delirious pediatric burn patients is fraught with a number of difficulties and is not completely safe and effective.
Previous studies have shown that oral administration of minoxidil on 2 consecutive days produces an increase in heart rate and myocardial necrosis in Beagle dogs. Propranolol treatment (1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg every 8 h) did not abolish tachycardia and did not alter the incidence or severity of minoxidil-induced necrosis. In the present studies, pretreatment with either furosenmide (10 mg/kg) or hydrochlorothiazide (250 mg/kg) reduced serum potassium levels. However, only furosemide (for 11 days) reduced significantly the incidence of minoxidil-induced necrosis; only 2 of 10 animals (20%) developed myocardial lesions compared to 11 of 14 (79%) in the non-treated group. The incidence and severity of lesions in hearts from animals treated with furosemide for 3 days or hydrochlorothiazide for 11 days were essentially the same as in animals given minoxidil alone. Thus, furosemide, under certain conditions, can reduce the incidence of acute ventricular lesions induced by minoxidil.
Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is present in a number of hypothalamic nuclei. Besides actions in circuits regulating feeding behaviour and stress responses, the hypothalamic functions of CART are largely unknown. We report that CART immunoreactivity is present in hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurones. Adult male rats received a systemic injection of the neuronal tracer Fluorogold (FG) 2 days before fixation, and subsequent double- and triple-labelling immunoflourescence analysis demonstrated that neuroendocrine CART-containing neurones were present in the anteroventral periventricular, supraoptic, paraventricular (PVN) and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. In the PVN, CART-positive neuroendocrine neurones were found in all of cytoarchitectonically identified nuclei. In the periventricular nucleus, approximately one-third of somatostatin cells were also CART-immunoreactive. In the medial parvicellular subnucleus of the PVN, CART and FG coexisted with thyrotrophin-releasing hormone, whereas very few of the corticotrophin-releasing hormone containing cells were CART-immunoreactive. In the arcuate nucleus, CART was extensively colocalized with pro-opiomelanocortin in the ventrolateral part, but completely absent from neuroendocrine neurones of the dorsomedial part. To assess the possible role of CART as a hypothalamic-releasing factor, immunoreactive CART was measured in blood samples from the long portal vessels connecting the median eminence with the anterior pituitary gland. Adult male rats were anaesthetized and the infundibular stalk exposed via a transpharyngeal approach. The long portal vessels were transected and blood collected in 30-min periods (one prestimulatory and three poststimulatory periods). Compared to systemic venous plasma samples, baseline concentrations of immunoreactive CART were elevated in portal plasma. Exposure to sodium nitroprusside hypotension triggered a two-fold elevation of portal CART42-89 immunoreactivity throughout the 90-min stimulation period. In contrast, the concentration of portal plasma CART immunoreactivity dropped in the vehicle infused rats. The current study provides further evidence that CART is a neuroendocrine-releasing factor with a possible impact on anterior pituitary function during states of haemodynamic stress.
Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme inhibitors have an effective and established role in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure. However, a small number of such patients will subsequently develop renal insufficiency. These patients may be identified prior to, or shortly after, commencement of therapy by recognized criteria. This report describes 4 patients with congestive heart failure who developed severe renal insufficiency secondary to either enalapril or captopril therapy in the absence of any currently recognized predisposing factors. One patient died.
Hyponatremia caused by excessive natriuresis is common in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Natriuresis decreases the total blood volume through osmotic diuresis and increases the risk of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm. In such patients, hypervolemic therapy is difficult to achieve without causing hyponatremia because sodium replacement provokes further natriuresis and osmotic diuresis. We examined the effects of hydrocortisone, which promotes sodium retention, in patients with SAH.
Twenty-eight SAH patients were randomized into 2 groups after direct surgery: group 1 patients without hydrocortisone treatment (n=14) and group 2 patients with hydrocortisone treatment (1200 mg/d for 10 days; n=14). Both groups underwent hypervolemic therapy by aggressive sodium and water replacement. The goal of the hypervolemic therapy was to maintain the serum sodium level >140 mEq/L and the central venous pressure (CVP) within 8 to 12 cm H2O.
Group 2 demonstrated a lower sodium excretion (P<0.05) and higher serum sodium level (P<0.05) compared with group 1. Hyponatremia developed in 6 patients (43%) in group 1 and 0 patients in group 2 (P<0.05). Group 2 also demonstrated a lower urine volume, lower infusion volume (P<0.05) required for hypervolemic therapy, and higher CVP (P<0.05). Failure to maintain CVP was observed in 12 patients (86%) in group 1 and 3 patients (21%) in group 2 (P<0.05). Hydrocortisone caused no serious side effects.
Hydrocortisone clearly attenuates excessive natriuresis. Prophylactic hydrocortisone administration appears to have a therapeutic value in inducing hypervolemia efficiently after SAH.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of prazosin (t1/2, tmax, Cmax and AUC have been studied in 18 hypertensive patients with varying degrees of chronic renal failure (serum creatinine ranging from 1.6 to 11.4 mg/dl). An oral dose of 2 mg of prazosin was added to the preexisting antihypertensive medication. The degree of renal impairment did not influence the peak drug concentration, the time to peak or the serum half-life. On the other hand, the hypotensive action after 2 mg prazosin, was more pronounced in patients with severe chronic renal failure. This effect could not be explained by a difference in the pharmacokinetics of prazosin in severe as compared to moderate chronic renal failure or to normal renal function.
Pemoline is a CNS stimulant that was introduced in 1975 in the US and was used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Pemoline was withdrawn from the market 30 years later because of fatal hepatotoxicity associated with its use.
To create a system that will estimate the potential association between a serious adverse event and a medication early in its marketing cycle.
All case reports of acute liver failure associated with pemoline and reported to the US FDA from 1975 through 1999 were reviewed. All published articles on pemoline-induced hepatotoxicity were reviewed, and the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was applied. The incidence rate of idiopathic acute liver failure was estimated from the published literature. The data were analyzed using Fisher's Exact test and relative risks (RR) were calculated.
As early as 1978, there was a significant signal indicating that pemoline was associated with acute liver failure, with an RR of 24.08 (95% CI 4.67, 124.10; p < 0.05). With an increased number of cases, the significance of the association had been steadily increased.
This method enables researchers, clinicians, drug companies and regulators to identify uncommon adverse drug reactions, caused mostly by new medications, earlier than they currently are in the course of marketing and thus quantify serious adverse events.
Mice irradiated and reconstituted with hematopoietic cells lacking manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) show a persistent hemolytic anemia similar to human sideroblastic anemia (SA), including characteristic intra-mitochondrial iron deposition. SA is primarily an acquired, clonal marrow disorder occurring in individuals over 60 years of age with uncertain etiology.
To define early events in the pathogenesis of this murine model of SA, we compared erythroid differentiation of Sod2⁻/⁻ and normal bone marrow cells using flow cytometry and gene expression profiling of erythroblasts. The predominant transcriptional differences observed include widespread down-regulation of mitochondrial metabolic pathways and mitochondrial biogenesis. Multiple nuclear encoded subunits of complexes I-IV of the electron transport chain, ATP synthase (complex V), TCA cycle and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins were coordinately down-regulated in Sod2⁻/⁻ erythroblasts. Despite iron accumulation within mitochondria, we found increased expression of transferrin receptor, Tfrc, at both the transcript and protein level in SOD2 deficient cells, suggesting deregulation of iron delivery. Interestingly, there was decreased expression of ABCb7, the gene responsible for X-linked hereditary SA with ataxia, a component required for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.
These results indicate that in erythroblasts, mitochondrial oxidative stress reduces expression of multiple nuclear genes encoding components of the respiratory chain, TCA cycle and mitochondrial protein synthesis. An additional target of particular relevance for SA is iron:sulfur cluster biosynthesis. By decreasing transcription of components of cluster synthesis machinery, both iron utilization and regulation of iron uptake are impacted, contributing to the sideroblastic phenotype.
Endogenous lectins act as effectors of cellular activities such as growth regulation, migration, and adhesion. Following their immunohistochemical localization in our previous study (Saussez et al. in Histochem Cell Biol 123:29-41, 2005) we purified several galectins and used them as tools for monitoring accessible binding sites. Herein, we report the use of galectin histochemistry for the analysis of diethylstilbestrol (DES)-induced renal tumors in male Syrian hamster kidney (SHKT). Sections of normal kidney and DES-treated kidney were analyzed with biotinylated galectins-1, -3 (full-length and truncated), and -7. Accessible binding sites were detected, localization was predominantly extracellular and confined to medium-sized and large tumors. Monitoring the SHKT-derived HKT-1097 line, processed in vitro or as xenograft material, cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for galectins-1, -3, and -3tr could be observed. Adaptation of SHKT cells to long-term growth in culture is thus associated with emergence of this signal. Our data set illustrates the feasibility to complement immunohistochemical data by application of the tissue lectins as probes, and to detect regulation of galectin reactivity with differential characteristics within tumor progression in vivo and unique features of the tumor cell line in vitro and in vivo.
A 68-year-old white man with Paget's disease and open-angle glaucoma was treated with methazolamide, 50 to 100 mg three times daily. Ten months after the medication was initiated he developed ureteral colic and a calcium oxalate stone was surgically removed. Three months after the drug was reinstituted the patient passed three calcium phosphate stones. This suggested a casual relationship between methazolamide and stone formation, although renal calculi also complicate Paget's disease and acetazolamide had been administered briefly.
In the present study, we investigated the susceptibility to restraint plus water-immersion stress (RWIS) in rats with daunomycin-induced nephrosis in comparison to that in normal rats. The severity of RWIS-induced gastric lesions was significantly less in nephrotic rats on the 20th and 40th days after a single i.v. injection of daunomycin (12 mg/kg) than in the respective control rats. Acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats significantly decreased under the 3-h stress. On the 20th day after treatment with daunomycin, acid secretion was significantly less in nephrotic rats than in control rats under both stress and unstressed conditions. Pretreatment of normal rats with methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, or phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor, significantly prevented the stress-induced gastric lesions and decreased acid secretion. N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, prevented the stress-induced gastric lesion formation only. These results indicate that nephrotic rats are more resistant to RWIS-induced gastric lesions than normal rats. In addition, these results suggest that the decrease in acid secretion related to the decrease in the release of NO from endothelial cells may contribute, at least in part, to the prevention of the stress-induced gastric lesion formation in nephrotic rats.
The effect of a single oral dose of 2.5 mg bromocriptine on intraocular pressure in 20 glaucoma patients is reported. Intraocular pressure was significantly reduced (31%), the maximal response being after 4-6 hours. A decrease in blood pressure was also noticed, maximal reduction (5%) at 4 hours. Three patients experienced nausea and dizziness. Possibly the reducing effect of bromocriptine on intraocular pressure is mediated by the stimulation of intraocular dopamine receptors (DA2).
In 18 patients with a benzodiazepine (BZD) dependency the drug was withdrawn. The dose of BZD was gradually reduced in nine of the patients, while the others were additionally treated with carbamazepine (CBZ) for a further 15 days after BZD discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms were assessed every third day during the study period. When comparing results in both groups, a clear trend towards less severe withdrawal symptoms could be observed in the group treated with CBZ. Some of the differences were statistically significant on days 9-12 after BZD withdrawal. Fundamental withdrawal symptoms (like hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, abnormal perception of movement, depersonalisation or derealisation) were also less severe in the group treated with CBZ compared with the group not receiving that treatment. These findings support the results of previous reports indicating a therapeutical effect of CBZ in BZD withdrawal.
The changes induced in the mean arterial blood pressure of anaesthetised rats following the administration of armed spider (Phoneutria nigriventer) venom have been investigated. The intravenous injection of Phoneutria nigriventer venom (0.1 mg/kg) evoked a brief and reversible decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure whereas a higher dose of venom (0.3 mg/kg) caused a biphasic response characterized by a short-lasting hypotension followed by a sustained and prolonged hypertension (40-50 min). These changes were accompanied by tachycardia, salivation, fasciculations, defecation and respiratory disturbances. Pretreatment of the animals with atropine (10 mg/kg), propranolol (100 mg/kg), phenoxybenzamine (100 mg/kg) and indomethacin (4 mg/kg) did not significantly affect the mean arterial blood pressure changes induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom. Similarly, the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,DTic7,Oic8]-bradykinin) (0.6 mg/kg), the PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 (3-(4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno-(3,2f) (1,2,4)-triazolo-(4,3-a) (1,4)-diazepine-2-yl)-(4-morpholinyl)-1-propanone) (20 mg/kg), the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist SR 140333 ((S)1-(2-[3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-(3-iso-propoxyphenyl acetyl) piperidin-3-yl] ethyl)-4-phenyl-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2] octane, chloride) (0.5 mg/kg), the tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist SR 48968 ((S)-N-methyl-N[4-(4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3,4-dichlorophen yl) butyl]benzamide) (0.5 mg/kg) and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10 mg/kg) had no significant effect on the mean arterial blood pressure changes induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom. The increase in the blood pressure induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom was also not significantly affected by either the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg) or the endothelin ETA receptor antagonist FR 139317 ((R)2-[(R)-2-[[1-(hexahydro-1H-azepinyl]carbonyl]amino-4-methyl- pentanoyl]amino-3-[3-(1-methyl-1H-indoyl)]propionyl] amino-3-(2-pyridyl) propionic acid) (30 mg/kg). The ATP-dependent K+ channel antagonist glibenclamide (50 mg/kg) reduced by 40% the hypotension induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom without affecting the hypertensive response. Pretreatment of the animals with L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists such as verapamil (10-100 micrograms/kg/min), diltiazem (40-120 micrograms/kg/min) and nifedipine (0.3-10 mg/kg) markedly attenuated the hypertension induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom. Verapamil (30 micrograms/kg/min) and diltiazem (120 micrograms/kg/min) also promptly reversed the established hypertension induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom when infused 8 min after venom injection. Our results indicate that the brief decrease of blood pressure induced by Phoneutria nigriventer venom is partially due to ATP-dependent K+ channel activation. The prolonged hypertension seems to result from direct Ca2+ entry into vascular and/or cardiac muscles.
Diffuse hair loss ranks among the most frequent and psychologically most distressing adverse effects of systemic therapy with retinoids, which severely limits their therapeutic use even where clinically desired. Since the underlying mechanisms of retinoid-induced effluvium are as yet unknown, we have investigated the influence of the prototypic retinoid all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, tretinoin) on the growth of human scalp hair follicles (HF) in culture. HF in the anagen VI stage of the hair cycle were cultured in the presence of 10(-8) or 10(-10) M ATRA. Compared with controls, hair shaft elongation declined significantly already after 2 d in the ATRA-treated group, and approximately 80% of the ATRA-treated HF had prematurely entered catagen-like stage at day 6, compared with 30% in the control group. This corresponded to an upregulation of apoptotic and a downregulation of Ki67-positive cells in ATRA-treated HF. Since transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has been implicated as a key inducer of catagen, we next studied whether ATRA treatment had any effect on follicular expression. TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity was detected in the outer root sheath of anagen VI scalp HF. In catagen follicles, TGF-beta2 was also expressed in the regressing epithelial strand. After 4 d of ATRA treatment, TGF-beta2 was significantly upregulated in anagen HF in the dermal papilla (DP) and the dermal sheath, 7, and TGF-beta neutralizing antibody partially abrogated at RA induced hair growth inhibition. Real-time PCR confirmed a significant upregulation of TGF-beta2 transcripts in ATRA-treated hair bulbs. This study is the first to provide direct evidence that ATRA can indeed induce a catagen-like stage in human HF and suggests that this occurs, at least in part, via upregulation of TGF-beta2 in the DP. Therefore, topical TGF-beta2/TGF-beta receptor II antagonists deserve to be explored for the prevention and management of retinoid-induced hair loss.
A 27-year-old woman with multiple bilobal liver metastases of a carcinoid tumour and carcinoid syndrome was treated with the somatostatin analogue Octreotide, 450-600 micrograms daily subcutaneously. This improved previous attacks of marked epigastric pain, while endocrine activity and tumour mass remained unchanged. Shortly after treatment had begun, soft fatty stools and oxaluria were noted. After six months severe renal colics were found to be due to non-opaque caliceal calculi, and a contracted non-functioning gallbladder was discovered. The calculi consisted of oxalate. The enteric hyperoxalosis, oxaluria and urolithiasis were presumably side effects of the Octreotide treatment.
As soon as the use of streptomycin was started for the treatment of tuberculosis, its ototoxic effect was discovered. Initial reports demonstrated that streptomycin was successful in reducing vestibular responses while preserving cochlear activity. Streptomycin sulfate has been used for almost half a century for the treatment of vertigo in patients with Meniere's disease. At the Gruppo Otologico, Piacenza, Italy, between 1987 and 1995 we treated 16 patients with either bilateral Meniere's disease or with Meniere's disease in their only hearing ear, adopting the titration streptomycin therapy protocol of Graham et al. Three patients with follow-up periods of less than 2 years were not included in this study. The ages of the patients ranged from 36 to 64 years with a mean of 49.2 years. The patients were observed for 2 to 8.8 years. The dose of administered streptomycin varied from 14 to 49 gm. Episodic vertigo was totally relieved in all of the patients after initial treatment, whereas hearing remained the same or was improved when compared with the pretreatment levels. Five of the patients experienced recurring vertigo during a period of 4 to 24 months after initial treatment. Oscillopsia persisted in two patients and ataxia in darkness persisted in another two patients. Hearing was unchanged in 14 ears, improved in 2 ears, and worsened in 4 ears at the last follow-up evaluation. The overall outcome indicated that intramuscular titration streptomycin therapy seems to be one of the most important therapeutic options in the treatment of disabling vertigo in patients with either bilateral Meniere's disease or Meniere's disease in an only hearing ear.
Antiarrhythmic drugs occasionally facilitate, rather than prevent, ventricular tachycardia. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of procainamide facilitation of ventricular tachycardia initiation during programmed electrical stimulation in patients with no history of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia but who are at high risk. Twenty patients with advanced heart failure (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 0.19 +/- 0.09) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and in whom sustained ventricular tachycardia was not inducible by programmed electrical stimulation in the basal state were studied. Six patients had coronary artery disease, 13 had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and 1 had valvular heart disease. All patients received programmed stimulation from the right ventricular apex with one to three extra-stimuli before and after the intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg of procainamide (serum level 6.6 +/- 2.4 mcg/l). In two patients (10%) sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was initiated only after the administration of procainamide. One of these patients later died in ventricular tachycardia during hyperkalemia. Of the noninducible patients, during a follow-up period of 6 +/- 5 months, two died suddenly and one developed symptomatic ventricular tachycardia. Thus, procainamide can unmask potential reentry circuits in some patients who have not had spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia. In patients with heart failure, this risk, as assessed by programmed stimulation after a single dose of procainamide, appears to be low.
No data are available in the literature about clozapine clinical efficacy when the drug is administered to schizophrenic patients who relapsed after discontinuation of long-term clozapine treatment and who had previously been responsive to the drug. In this study, three chronic schizophrenic patients are presented, who, in spite of a good clinical efficacy, decided to stop long-term clozapine treatment. Soon after their relapse they were again treated with clozapine: follow-up of these patients showed that clozapine partially lost its clinical efficacy since all three patients got worse compared with their initial clinical response.
