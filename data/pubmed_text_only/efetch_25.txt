To compare the epitopes of antibodies for myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the serum from patients with propylthiouracil (PTU) induced vasculitis and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).
Serum samples from patients with PTU-induced vasculitis (n = 10) and MPA (n = 10) were collected and used to inhibit monoclonal antibodies against human MPO 3D8 and 6B9 and then affinity was purified, horseradish peroxidase conjugated and human MPO antibodies determined (Pab1-HRP, Pab2-HRP) in a competitive inhibition ELISA system using soluble human MPO as solid phase ligands. The Pab1-HRP and Pab2-HRP were affinity purified from plasma exchanges of a patient with PTU-induced vasculitis and a patient with MPA. The inhibition rates were evaluated and compared between PTU group and primary MPA group.
In PTU group, all the 10 serum samples could inhibit 3D8; the average inhibition rate was 44.7%, 9/10 of the serum samples could inhibit 6B9; the average inhibition rate was 35.6%; In MPA group, all 10 serum samples could inhibit 3D8 and 6B9; the average inhibition rates were 68.4% and 62.2%. Serum in both groups could inhibit Pab1-HRP and the inhibition rates were both more than 80%; the average inhibition rate for Pab2-HRP in MPA group was significantly higher than that in PTU group (76.3% vs 58.9%, P < 0.01).
MPO antibodies from patients with PTU-induced vasculitis and patients with primary MPA could recognize more than one epitopes on native MPO molecule. Although the epitopes were overlapping between the two groups, the epitopes of MPO antibodies from patients with PTU-induced vasculitis might be more restricted.
Diethylstilbestrol (DES) induces mammary tumors in female ACI rats and is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer in humans. Diallyl sulfide (DAS) has been shown to prevent cancer in animals. Previously, we have shown that DAS inhibits the production of DES induced DNA adducts when given prior to DES. We hypothesize that DAS alters the expression of genes responsible for DES metabolism. To test this hypothesis, four groups of 10 female ACI rats were treated daily for four days as follows: (1) corn oil, (2) 50mg/kg DES, (3) 50mg/kg DAS, and (4) 50mg/kg DAS+50mg/kg DES. RNA was isolated from breast tissue and mRNA levels of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were analyzed by real-time PCR. DES, DAS, and DES/DAS treatments increased the expression of CYP1A1 by 2.1-, 4.7-, and 12.7-fold, respectively. Similar results were seen for CYP1B1. DES decreased the expression of GST by 23%, whereas DAS and DAS/DES treatments increased the expression of GST by 12- and 16.7-fold, respectively. Similar results were seen with SOD. These results suggests that DAS may prevent the formation of DES induced DNA damage by altering the expression of DES metabolizing genes.
BMS-181174 is an aminodisulphide derivative of Mitomycin C (MMC) with activity against a range of tumour cell lines and xenografts, including MMC-resistant tumours. In a phase I study of 82 patients with confirmed malignancy, we administered BMS-181174 at doses of 0.8-75 mg m(-2) by intravenous injection every 28 days. At least three patients were evaluated at each dose level, and 174 courses were administered. The pharmacokinetics were dose linear at BMS-181174 doses of 11.5-75 mg m(-2) and the drug appeared to undergo wide distribution. The maximum-tolerated dose was 65 mg m(-2) in previously treated patients and 75 mg m(-2) in chemotherapy-naive cases. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, particularly thrombocytopenia, which was prolonged and cumulative. Three patients treated at 65-75 mg m(-2) died suddenly with evidence of pneumonia/pneumonitis, thought to be drug-related. Other toxicities included thrombophlebitis, possible cardiotoxicity (asymptomatic, reversible decline in left ventricular function) and renal impairment. The partial response rate was 5% (4 out of 82) overall, and 9% (3 out of 32) in patients treated at 65-75 mg m(-2). Responses occurred in treated and previously-untreated patients, including cases of colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site. BMS-181174 has anti-cancer activity but, because of its toxicity, particularly pneumonitis and thrombophlebitis, no phase II studies are planned.
1 x 10(5) cells of FAMFT-induced bladder cancer cell line (MBT-2) were injected into the right leg of the C3H/He mice. 10 days later, these animals with the same tumor size were divided into four groups. Group 1 is the control with no treatment. Group 2 underwent interleukin 2 (IL-2) treatment for 10 days since the 11th day after tumor inoculation. Group 3 received just one CPM injection on the 10th day. Group 4 had a combination therapy of CPM, followed by IL-2. Group 1 and 2 exhibited enlargement of tumor size, resulting in the death of all animals. Administration of CPM led to temporary disappearance of tumor, followed by local tumor recurrence in all cases. However, combined therapy with IL-2 showed complete remission of the tumors. Natural killer cell activity measured by the 51Cr release assay of the spleen cells using Yac-1 cells as target cells 20 days after tumor inoculation was found to be significantly higher in group 2 and 4, while lymphokine-activated killer cell activity of the spleen cells against P-815 cells showed no significant difference between the four groups.
The abuse liability of a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716 (N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxyamide hydrochloride), was evaluated in rhesus monkeys. Four rhesus monkeys with chronically indwelling venous catheters were initially trained to self-administer cocaine (30 microg/kg/injection) during daily 1-h sessions under a fixed ratio 50 (FR50) schedule of reinforcement. SR141716 was subsequently substituted for cocaine, and SR141716 dose was varied from 1 to 100 microg/kg/injection. Each dose of SR141716 was tested for four consecutive sessions and each unit dose was separated by at least three sessions of cocaine self-administration. Substitution of SR141716 for cocaine resulted in rapid extinction of lever pressing and none of the doses of SR141716 tested was self-administered above the vehicle levels. When the highest dose of SR141716 (100 microg/kg/injection) was evaluated, self-administration behavior was suppressed below vehicle levels suggesting that behaviorally active doses were evaluated. Since positive results in self-administration tests are generally predictive of abuse potential, the negative results with SR141716 suggest that this drug would likely have low abuse liability.
Electrophysiological and pharmacological analysis of L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia and tardive dyskinesia (L.DD) due to neuroleptics was performed on 12 patients with Parkinson's disease and on 12 others with psychotic diseases. This analysis included the examination of spinal reflexes, monosynaptic H reflex, polysynaptic cutaneous reflex of the lower limb, muscular responses to passive movement [stretch reflex and shortening reaction (SR)] and the study of the motor response to a dopaminergic stimulus (I.V. injection of Piribedil (PBD), a dopamine agonist). There was no difference in EMG activity between L.DD and TD. Three EMG patterns can be distinguished: anarchic discharge pattern (ADA), tonic grouping discharge pattern (AST) and rhythmic burst pattern (ABR). PBD effects indicate a possible relationship between the EMG patterns and the sensitivity level of the motor dopamine receptors. During L-Dopa dyskinesia and tardive dyskinesia, the same changes in spinal reflexes were observed. Muscle tone tested by muscular responses to passive movement (shortening and myotatic reaction) was normal. Monosynaptic excitability explored by H/M ratio was within the normal range. In contrast, the polysynaptic nociceptive reflex was increased in every case. In Parkinsonian patients with L-Dopa dyskinesia, this pattern of the spinal reflexes was significantly different in comparison to the rigid phase. Intravenous infusion of PBD suppressed tremor and provoked the occurrence of dyskinetic activity in Parkinsonian patients with L-Dopa dyskinesia during the rigid phase. During the dyskinetic phase, as in tardive dyskinesia, PBD increases these phenomena and changes EMG activity in rhythmic pattern. It is suggested that L-Dopa dyskinesia and tardive dyskinesia can be determined by testing EMG activity, spinal reflexes and dopaminergic reactivity. There is evidence to suggest that the various types of involuntary abnormal movement represent a single entity, and that dopamine receptor supersensitivity may be involved.
BZYX was designed as a dual-binding-site acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and selected from series of indanone derivatives. The present study was designed to examine the cognition-enhanced, anti-cholinesterase, and neuroprotective effects of BZYX. In the passive avoidance performance and radial arm maze, BZYX showed a comparable effect to donepezil and rivastigmine on memory deficits in different stages induced by scopolamine, NaNO(2) and ethanol, respectively. Ellman's assay indicated BZYX exhibited high inhibition on AChE activity. IC(50) values for BZYX: 0.058+/-0.022 microM; donepezil: 0.019+/-0.004 microM; rivastigmine: 3.81+/-2.81 microM; glantamine: 3.01+/-1.85 microM and huperzine A: 0.053+/-0.016 microM. BZYX also presented great neuroprotecive function from apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide(H(2)O(2)) in PC12 cells. MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection showed the viability of PC12 cells remarkably decreased with 400 microM H(2)O(2), while it significantly increased when the cells were pretreated with 0.1-1.0 microM BZYX. BZYX pretreatment remarkably reversed the loss of mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim), scavenged reactive oxygen species formation induced by H(2)O(2) and resulted in up-regulation of procaspase3 and xIAP protein level and down-regulation of phosphorylated JNK protein, p53 protein level and cleavage of caspase 3. It is speculated that the mitochondrial pathway, mediated by Bcl-2 family and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), might involved in the neuroprotection of BZYX. These results first demonstrated that BZYX had neuroprotective effects as well as cognition enhancement and acetylcholinesterase inhibition. It is hopeful that BZYX becomes a potential candidate for use in the intervention for neurodegenerative diseases.
To allow a study of beta-catenin mutations in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) induced by exogenous and endogenous carcinogens, we induced tumors in male Fischer 344 rats with N-nitrosodiethylamine and a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet. Administration of the former was followed by partial hepatectomy with colchicine to induce cell cycle disturbance and a selection pressure regimen (K. Ohashi et al., Cancer Res., 56: 3474-3479, 1996; M. Tsutsumi et al., Jpn. J. Cancer Res., 87: 5-9, 1996). HCCs were obtained after 42 weeks. With continuous choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined feeding, tumors were sampled after 75 weeks. Total RNA was extracted from individual lesions and mutations in the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation consensus motif of beta-catenin were investigated by reverse transcriptase-PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by nucleotide sequencing. Changes were detected in 5 of 11 HCCs induced by the exogenous carcinogen. The observed shifts of C:G-->G:C or C:G-->A:T at codon 33 and G:C-->T:A transversions at codon 34 were associated with beta-catenin protein accumulation and confirmed by Western blot analysis. Only 2 of 15 HCCs induced in the endogenous carcinogenesis regimen demonstrated mutations, those being transitions of C:G-->T:A at codon 41 without amino acid alteration. These results suggest that different genetic pathways underlie exogenous and endogenous liver carcinogenesis in rats.
In vitro and animal studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) modulates intestinal iron transport. We hypothesized that the effect of TNF-alpha might be particularly relevant if iron absorption is not effectively controlled by the HFE gene.
In patients with homozygous C282Y hemochromatosis, we investigated the influence of TNF-alpha -308G>A allelic variant on total body iron overload, determined in all patients by measuring iron removed during depletion therapy, and hepatic iron index and need for phlebotomy to prevent iron reaccumulation, measured in patient subgroups.
Of 86 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, 16 (19%) were heterozygous carriers and 1 (1%) was a homozygous carrier of the TNF-alpha promoter -308A allele. Mean (SD) total body iron overload was increased 2-fold in TNF-alpha -308A allele carriers [10.9 (7.6) g] compared with homozygous carriers of the G allele [5.6 (5.0) g, P<0.001]. Hepatic iron index differed markedly between TNF-alpha -308A allele carriers [5.6 (3.5) micromol/g/year] and homozygous G allele carriers [3.1 (2.2) micromol/g/year, P=0.040, n=30]. After iron depletion, the need for phlebotomy to prevent iron reaccumulation (maintenance therapy) was substantially higher in TNF-alpha -308A allele carriers than in homozygous G allele carriers (P=0.014, n=73). We used multiple regression analyses to exclude possible confounding effects of sex, age, family screening, body-mass index, and meat or alcohol intake.
TNF-alpha -308G>A allelic variant modulates iron accumulation in patients with hereditary (homozygous C282Y) hemochromatosis, but the effect of the TNF-alpha -308A allele on clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis was less accentuated than expected from the increased iron load associated with this allele.
Extracts from plants containing plumbagin (PLB) continue to be used as a treatment of a number of chronic immunologically-based diseases. However, most of these claims are supported only by anecdotal evidence with few scientific reports describing the mechanism of action or the efficacy of plumbagin in the suppression of the immune response. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that plumbagin-induced suppression of the immune response was mediated through the induction of apoptosis. Splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice cultured in the presence of 0.5 microM or greater concentrations of PLB significantly reduced proliferative responses to mitogens, including anti-CD3 mAbs, concanavalin A (Con A), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in vitro. Exposure of naïve and activated splenocytes to PLB led to a significant increase in the levels of apoptosis. In addition, PLB treatment led to a significant increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in naïve and activated splenocytes. Furthermore, treatment with the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), prevented PLB-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role of ROS in PLB-induced apoptosis. PLB-induced apoptosis led to ROS-mediated activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. In addition, plumbagin led to increased expression of Fas. Finally, treatment of mice with PLB (5mg/kg) led to thymic and splenic atrophy as well as a significant suppression of the response to SEB and dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) in vivo. Together, these results suggest that plumbagin has significant immunosuppressive properties which are mediated by generation of ROS, upregulation of Fas, and the induction of apoptosis.
Microcephaly-capillary malformation (MIC-CAP) syndrome is characterized by severe microcephaly with progressive cortical atrophy, intractable epilepsy, profound developmental delay and multiple small capillary malformations on the skin. We used whole-exome sequencing of five patients with MIC-CAP syndrome and identified recessive mutations in STAMBP, a gene encoding the deubiquitinating (DUB) isopeptidase STAMBP (STAM-binding protein, also known as AMSH, associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) that has a key role in cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis and sorting. Patient cell lines showed reduced STAMBP expression associated with accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated protein aggregates, elevated apoptosis and insensitive activation of the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. The latter cellular phenotype is notable considering the established connection between these pathways and their association with vascular and capillary malformations. Furthermore, our findings of a congenital human disorder caused by a defective DUB protein that functions in endocytosis implicates ubiquitin-conjugate aggregation and elevated apoptosis as factors potentially influencing the progressive neuronal loss underlying MIC-CAP syndrome.
Pulmonary aspiration of gastric acid is a serious complication during anaesthesia and may cause aspiration pneumonitis and adult respiratory distress syndrome. The development of pulmonary hypertension may aggravate the initial course of the aspiration pneumonitis. The authors hypothesized that acid aspiration induces an acute increase in right ventricular pressure in the rat heart. Additionally, it was hypothesized as a secondary study that endothelin levels would be increased in this rat model.
Male Sprague Dawley rats, anaesthetized with sevoflurane, underwent tracheostomy, and catheters were inserted into the carotid and right ventricle. Lung injury was induced by instillation of 0.4 ml kg(-1) 0.1 mol l(-1) HCl; a control group received the same volume of 0.9% NaCl. Rats were then ventilated for 6 hours. p(a)O2, mean arterial blood pressures and right ventricular systolic pressures were documented every 30 minutes, and arterial blood gases were measured at baseline, 30, 90, 180, 270 and 360 min. Wet/dry ratio was performed and additionally endothelin-1 levels were examined before and 180 and 360 min after aspiration.
p(a)O2 values were lower, whereas right ventricular systolic pressures were significantly higher in the HCl group. Mortality rate was 50% after HCl aspiration, whereas 100% of the rats survived NaCl aspiration. Wet/dry ratio and endothelin-1 levels showed a significant increase after 180 and 360 min of HCl aspiration.
Acid aspiration induces a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and endothelin levels, and causes metabolic acidosis in this animal model.
Pathologic thrombosis is a major cause of mortality. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) features episodes of small-vessel thrombosis resulting in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure. Atypical HUS (aHUS) can result from genetic or autoimmune factors that lead to pathologic complement cascade activation. Using exome sequencing, we identified recessive mutations in DGKE (encoding diacylglycerol kinase ɛ) that co-segregated with aHUS in nine unrelated kindreds, defining a distinctive Mendelian disease. Affected individuals present with aHUS before age 1 year, have persistent hypertension, hematuria and proteinuria (sometimes in the nephrotic range), and develop chronic kidney disease with age. DGKE is found in endothelium, platelets and podocytes. Arachidonic acid-containing diacylglycerols (DAG) activate protein kinase C (PKC), which promotes thrombosis, and DGKE normally inactivates DAG signaling. We infer that loss of DGKE function results in a prothrombotic state. These findings identify a new mechanism of pathologic thrombosis and kidney failure and have immediate implications for treating individuals with aHUS.
Aspirin (ASA), an irreversible cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, induces ventricular septal defect (VSD) and diaphragmatic hernia (DH) in rat fetuses when administered on gestation days (GDs) 9-10, a critical period for cardiovascular (CV) and midline development. Evaluation of a spectrum of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; reversible COX inhibitors) showed that while some NSAIDs induced VSD in rats, none of the NSAIDs evaluated produced DH. In addition to inhibiting COX, ASA also inhibits carbonic anhydrase. The purpose of this study was to determine whether concurrent inhibition of COX and carbonic anhydrase would produce a teratogenic profile that includes both VSD and DH. To inhibit both COX and carbonic anhydrase, ibuprofen (COX inhibitor) and acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) were coadministered on GDs 9-10. Groups of 20 female Crl:CD(SD)IGS BR rats were given either 300 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ibuprofen, 1000 mg kg(-1) day(-1) acetazolamide, or both (combination of ibuprofen and acetazolamide). Fetuses were evaluated on GD 21 for external and visceral development. Ibuprofen induced VSD in 3.7% of fetuses per litter; no defects in appendicular skeletal development were noted. Acetazolamide induced VSD in 5.9% of the fetuses per litter and appendicular defects in 41% of the fetuses per litter. Coadministration of ibuprofen and acetazolamide produced VSD in 18.7% of the fetuses per litter and appendicular defects in 77% of the fetuses per litter; however, there were no DH. Therefore, while concurrent inhibition of COX and carbonic anhydrase did not produce DH, potentiation was noted for the induction of VSD and appendicular anomalies.
Sixteen patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) who were taking theophylline were identified over 6 months. After theophylline was discontinued the atrial rate fell and MAT resolved in all sixteen patients. Five patients were challenged with intravenous aminophylline to investigate the role of theophylline in the genesis of MAT. MAT with a rapid ventricular response occurred in all five even though metabolic and respiratory variables did not change. MAT returned on challenge in three patients in whom serum theophylline levels were within the generally accepted therapeutic range (10-20 mg/l). In individual patients, theophylline had a dose-related effect on the atrial rate and the amount of ectopic atrial activity. Thus, theophylline may commonly precipitate MAT and treatment with the drug should be carefully considered in patients with respiratory insufficiency and MAT.
The aims of this study were to investigate the role of endothelin-1 in FK506-induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction of rats treated with the drug for 8 (short-term) or 30 (long-term) days and to measure malondialdehyde levels in the kidneys. Kidney and mesentery of rats were perfused. In the short-term treated groups, there was no significant change in systolic blood pressure. The response to noradrenaline only in renal vascular beds was significantly increased by FK506 and this increase was prevented by Bosentan. FK506 had no significant effect on sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilation in comparison with solvent in both vascular beds. Bosentan failed to prevent these responses. In the long-term treated groups, at the end of the treatment with FK506, there was a significant increase in blood pressure, but no change in the response to noradrenaline in either kidneys or mesentery. The increase in blood pressure was prevented by bosentan treatment. FK506 increased malondialdehyde levels in the kidneys of the rats from only the long-term treated groups. Bosentan did not change this increase. Our results indicated that endothelin-1 plays a key role in the FK506-induced change in vascular reactivity to noradrenaline in renal vascular beds and drug-induced hypertension in the rats. There was no relationship between oxidative stress and FK506-induced hypertension.
The majority of epilepsies are focal in origin, with seizures emanating from one brain region. Although focal epilepsies often arise from structural brain lesions, many affected individuals have normal brain imaging. The etiology is unknown in the majority of individuals, although genetic factors are increasingly recognized. Autosomal dominant familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF) is notable because family members have seizures originating from different cortical regions. Using exome sequencing, we detected DEPDC5 mutations in two affected families. We subsequently identified mutations in five of six additional published large families with FFEVF. Study of families with focal epilepsy that were too small for conventional clinical diagnosis with FFEVF identified DEPDC5 mutations in approximately 12% of families (10/82). This high frequency establishes DEPDC5 mutations as a common cause of familial focal epilepsies. Shared homology with G protein signaling molecules and localization in human neurons suggest a role of DEPDC5 in neuronal signal transduction.
Many works have reported the interaction between selenium and mercury in the mammalian body and that chalcogen seems to have a protective effect against mercury toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the hemolytic effects of sodium selenite and/or mercuric chloride in human blood under in vitro conditions. For this, total venous blood from healthy subjects (males and females) was heparinized and incubated at 37 degrees C for 90 min with different concentrations of sodium selenite and/or mercuric chloride. The hemolytic effects of compounds were evaluated by measuring plasma hemoglobin concentration after centrifugation. In addition, 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) from plasma and erythrocytes, as well as erythrocyte nonprotein thiols (NPSH), were also evaluated in order to investigate molecular mechanisms related to selenite- or mercury-induced hemolysis. Mercuric chloride and sodium selenite, alone (400 microM), promoted a small in vitro hemolytic effect in human erythrocytes. However, when blood was exposed to both compounds (200 microM of each), there was an extremely high synergistic hemolytic effect. The exposure of blood to sodium selenite (400 microM), mercuric chloride (400 microM), and both compounds (200 microM each) did not alter erythrocyte TBARS levels. Sodium selenite presented a high oxidant effect toward erythrocyte NPSH; however, this effect was inhibited by mercuric chloride. The current results point to a synergistic hemolytic effect of sodium selenite and mercuric chloride in human blood, suggesting new understanding on the selenium-mercury antagonism. Moreover, this observed hemolysis seems to be not related to lipoperoxidation or thiol depletion.
We utilized data from two Kaiser Permanente medical care programs to evaluate risks of hematopoietic and lymphoproliferative (HLP) malignancies after use of 14 common medications. The subjects were adult cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (N = 94), multiple myeloma (N = 159), and leukemia (N = 257) and individually matched controls (N = 695). Abstractors reviewed medical records and recorded medication notations. Using a minimum 5-year exposure lag between first notation and malignancy diagnosis, the risk of NHL was greater among plan members who were prescribed amphetamines [odds ratio (OR) = 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-4.8], lidocaine (OR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.2-5.5), and meprobamate (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.03-4.3). The risk of NHL rose with increasing number of medical record notations for amphetamines; however, there was no association with number of notations for lidocaine or meprobamate. The odds ratio for total leukemia was decreased among patients who took chloramphenicol (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2-0.97).
In two experiments rats were trained to self-administer intravenous cocaine on chained schedules using different responses in the initial (drug-seeking) and terminal (drug-taking) links. In both between- (Experiment 1) and within-subject designs (Experiment 2), the drug-taking response was then either extinguished or reinforced in the absence of the opportunity to perform the seeking response. In a subsequent extinction test with the seeking manipulanda alone, the rate of drug seeking was reduced after the prior extinction of the associated taking response. An additional group trained with a sucrose reinforcer showed a comparable devaluation effect. These findings demonstrate that seeking responses for cocaine and food rewards are mediated by a representation of the contingency between seeking responses and the opportunity to take the reward.
Propylthiouracil (PTU) can induce anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) positive vasculitis. We performed a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of MPO-ANCA in patients with childhood onset Graves' disease (GD) receiving PTU and to assess the relationship between ANCA and clinical manifestations of vasculitis. We studied 60 patients (59 girls and one boy) between 7.3 and 25.0 years of age (mean +/- SD, 14.71 +/- 4.49). GD, diagnosed at the age of 3.0 to 14.5 years (11.3 +/- 2.48), was designated as: newly diagnosed, on PTU therapy, and after PTU discontinuation in 4, 50 and 6 patients, respectively. Manifestations of vasculitis were noted and the patients were tested for MPO-ANCA, antinuclear antibodies, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and urine analysis. Twenty-six patients (43.3%) reacted positively for MPO-ANCA, 23 were on PTU therapy (0.42 to 6.00, median 3.00 years) and three had discontinued PTU. There were 34 (56.7%) ANCA-negative patients and 27 patients on PTU therapy (0.25 to 5.17, median 1.00 years, p = 0.012). Vasculitis presented in 16 patients (26.7%), all of whom were receiving PTU at the time of the study. The percentage of vasculitis among MPO-ANCA positive patients was 27.6% more than in the negative group, p = 0.017. PTU was discontinued in patients with vasculitis and positive for MPO-ANCA. Our findings show a high prevalence of MPO-ANCA positivity and a significantly higher percentage of vasculitis among these patients, suggesting that patients taking PTU should be closely observed for the appearance of MPO-ANCA and signs of vasculitis, especially patients GD who have been treated for a long time.
Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, inducible, intracellular proteins that bind heavy metals with high affinity. MT-1 is known as a stress-inducible protein and functions as an antioxidant enzyme. Areca quid chewing is a major risk factor in the development and further progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to compare MT-1 expression in normal human oral epithelium and OSCC and further explore the potential mechanism that may lead to induce MT-1 expression. Thirty four OSCC and 10 normal epithelium specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry and analyzed by the clinico-pathological profiles. The oral epithelial cell line GMN cells were challenged with arecoline, a major areca nut alkaloid, by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, tobacco smoke carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and glutathione (GSH) precursor N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were added to find the possible regulatory mechanisms. The results from immunohistochemistry demonstrated that MT-1 expression was significantly higher in OSCC specimens (p<0.05). No significant difference in MT-1 expression was observed with respect to age, sex, T category, and stage (p>0.05). The high MT-1 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (p=0.012). In addition, arecoline was found to elevate MT-1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Furthermore, the addition of BaP enhanced the arecoline-induced MT-1 expression (p<0.05). The addition of NAC markedly inhibited the arecoline-induced MT-1 expression (p<0.05). These results lead to the conclusion that MT-1 expression is significantly upregulated in areca quid chewing associated-OSCC. The expression profile suggests MT-1 could be used clinically as a marker for tumors possessing the potential for lymph node metastasis. The compounds of tobacco products may act synergistically in the pathogenesis of OSCC in areca quid chewers. The regulation of MT-1 expression induced by arecoline is critically dependent on the intracellular GSH concentration.
The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases in patients with hypertension. Angiotensin II is involved in structural atrial remodeling, which contributes to the onset and maintenance of AF in paced animal models. We investigated the role of angiotensin II in atrial structural remodeling in rats with hypertension. Ten-week-old male Wistar-Kyoto rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: a control group (no treatment), an Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) group (administered L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, 1 g/l in drinking water), an L-NAME+candesartan group (L-NAME plus candesartan-an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)-at 0.1 mg/kg/day), and an L-NAME + hydralazine group (L-NAME plus hydralazine at 120 mg/l in drinking water). Eight weeks after treatment, the L-NAME group showed significantly higher systolic blood pressure than the control group (197 +/- 12 vs.138 +/- 5 mmHg, p < 0.05). Candesartan or hydralazine with L-NAME reduced systolic blood pressure to baseline. Chronic inhibition of NO synthesis increased the extent of fibrosis and transforming growth factor-beta expression in atrial tissue, and both of these effects were prevented by candesartan, but not by hydralazine. Cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction were induced in the L-NAME group, and these effects were also prevented by candesartan, but not by hydralazine. In contrast, the decrease in thrombomodulin expression in the atrial endocardium in hypertensive rats was restored by candesartan and hydralazine. The ARB prevented atrial structural remodeling, a possible contributing factor for the development of AF, in the hearts of rats with hypertension induced by long-term inhibition of NO synthesis.
