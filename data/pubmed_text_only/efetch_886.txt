A case of anorexia, paranoid delusions, and lethargy associated with digoxin toxicity is presented here. The digitalis glycosides are among the most commonly used drugs in modern medicine, and as such, they frequently cause toxicity. Although cardiac side effects of digoxin are well recognized, less attention has been paid to potential CNS effects. Psychiatric manifestations, from calm disorientation to violent psychosis, tend to occur more often in elderly patients and may be the earliest or only sign of digitalis toxicity.
We report the case of a young woman with Crohn's disease who developed a debilitating peripheral neuropathy when treated with metronidazole 2000 mg/d for 50 days. The patient's neuropathy improved considerably after the discontinuation of metronidazole, but still persists two years later. The current literature on this topic is reviewed. Reports such as this one underscore the need to closely monitor the neurologic status of patients undergoing chronic treatment with metronidazole.
Contrast-induced nephropathy remains a common complication of radiographic procedures. Pretreatment with sodium bicarbonate is more protective than sodium chloride in animal models of acute ischemic renal failure. Acute renal failure from both ischemia and contrast are postulated to occur from free-radical injury. However, no studies in humans or animals have evaluated the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate for prophylaxis against contrast-induced nephropathy.
To examine the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate compared with sodium chloride for preventive hydration before and after radiographic contrast.
A prospective, single-center, randomized trial conducted from September 16, 2002, to June 17, 2003, of 119 patients with stable serum creatinine levels of at least 1.1 mg/dL (> or =97.2 micromol/L) who were randomized to receive a 154-mEq/L infusion of either sodium chloride (n = 59) or sodium bicarbonate (n = 60) before and after iopamidol administration (370 mg iodine/mL). Serum creatinine levels were measured at baseline and 1 and 2 days after contrast.
Patients received 154 mEq/L of either sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, as a bolus of 3 mL/kg per hour for 1 hour before iopamidol contrast, followed by an infusion of 1 mL/kg per hour for 6 hours after the procedure.
Contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase of 25% or more in serum creatinine within 2 days of contrast.
There were no significant group differences in age, sex, incidence of diabetes mellitus, ethnicity, or contrast volume. Baseline serum creatinine was slightly higher but not statistically different in patients receiving sodium bicarbonate treatment (mean [SD], 1.71 [0.42] mg/dL [151.2 [37.1] micromol/L] for sodium chloride and 1.89 [0.69] mg/dL [167.1 [61.0] micromol/L] for sodium bicarbonate; P =.09). The primary end point of contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 8 patients (13.6%) infused with sodium chloride but in only 1 (1.7%) of those receiving sodium bicarbonate (mean difference, 11.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6%-21.2%; P =.02). A follow-up registry of 191 consecutive patients receiving prophylactic sodium bicarbonate and meeting the same inclusion criteria as the study resulted in 3 cases of contrast-induced nephropathy (1.6%; 95% CI, 0%-3.4%).
Hydration with sodium bicarbonate before contrast exposure is more effective than hydration with sodium chloride for prophylaxis of contrast-induced renal failure.
The present study investigates the effects of chronic administration of ACEIs (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors; either zofenopril or enalapril) in combination with a diruetic (hydrochlorothiazide) on BP (blood pressure) increase and renal injury induced by L-NAME (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester), an inhibitor of NO (nitric oxide) synthesis. Rats were untreated or received L-NAME alone, L-NAME+zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide or L-NAME+enalapril+hydrochlorothiazide for 8 weeks. L-NAME treatment resulted in marked elevation in BP and mortality. Treatment with either ACEI and diuretic prevented the increase in BP induced by L-NAME, reduced the death rate and improved excretory parameters. Renal injury in the L-NAME group was severe, but, in the groups treated with either ACEI and diuretic, glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions were not observed and the intensity, number and size of vessels affected was reduced. However, the efficacy of zofenopril+diuretic was superior to that of enalapril+diuretic in reducing vascular alterations. Oxidative stress indices and the expression of NO synthase and nitrotyrosine were normalized by the treatments. In conclusion, the combined treatment of zofenopril or enalapril with hydrochlorothiazide completely prevented the development of arterial hypertension induced by L-NAME. Renal morphological and functional alterations in the hypertensive animals were also almost completely normalized, but the treatment with zofenopril+diuretic produced a more complete organ protection. The protective effect is related to an activation of endothelial NO synthase expression and to a normalization of the oxidative stress parameters due to the inhibition of angiotensin II.
This work characterizes a mutant integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa) from a thrombasthenic patient, ET, whose platelets fail to aggregate in response to stimuli. The nature of defect was defined by the reduced ability of synthetic peptide ligands, corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain (gamma 402-411) and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), to increase the binding of the occupancy-dependent anti-LIBS1 antibody to mutant alpha IIb beta 3 and the reduced binding of mutant alpha IIb beta 3 to an immobilized RGD peptide. In addition, ET's platelets failed to bind the ligand-mimetic monoclonal anti-alpha IIb beta 3, PAC1. DNA sequence analysis of amplified ET genomic DNA revealed a single G----A base change which encoded substitution of R214 by Q in mature beta 3. Introduction of this point mutation into recombinant wild type alpha IIb beta 3 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells reproduced the ET platelet alpha IIb beta 3 deficits in binding of fibrinogen, mAb PAC1, and synthetic peptide ligands. Furthermore, substitution of R214 by Q in the synthetic peptide containing the sequence of beta 3(211-222) resulted in decreased ability of this peptide to block fibrinogen binding to purified alpha IIb beta 3. These findings suggest that substitution of beta 3 R214 by Q is responsible for the functional defect in alpha IIb beta 3 and that R214 is proximal to or part of a ligand binding domain in alpha IIb beta 3.
Incubation of rat erythrocytes with benoxaprofen resulted in increased glucose utilization, lactate production, depletion of cellular ATP and significant haemolysis. In isolated red cell membranes, benoxaprofen produced a dose related stimulation of both Ca2+ dependent and Ca2+ independent ATPase activities. Coincubation of either erythrocytes or red cell membranes with cysteine ameliorated the effects of benoxaprofen. A possible association exists between the mechanism of the reported anti-inflammatory activity of benoxaprofen and its cellular toxicity.
Cancer cells that develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents are a major clinical obstacle in the successful treatment of breast cancer. Acquired cancer chemoresistance is a multifactorial phenomenon, involving various mechanisms and processes. Recent studies suggest that chemoresistance may be linked to drug-induced dysregulation of microRNA function. Furthermore, mounting evidence indicates the existence of similarities between drug-resistant and metastatic cancer cells in terms of resistance to apoptosis and enhanced invasiveness. We studied the role of miRNA alterations in the acquisition of cisplatin-resistant phenotype in MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells. We identified a total of 103 miRNAs that were overexpressed or underexpressed (46 upregulated and 57 downregulated) in MCF-7 cells resistant to cisplatin. These differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in the control of cell signaling, cell survival, DNA methylation and invasiveness. The most significantly dysregulated miRNAs were miR-146a, miR-10a, miR-221/222, miR-345, miR-200b and miR-200c. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-345 and miR-7 target the human multidrug resistance-associated protein 1. These results suggest that dysregulated miRNA expression may underlie the abnormal functioning of critical cellular processes associated with the cisplatin-resistant phenotype.
The development of an experimental model of myocardiopathy induced by Doxorubicin in rats.
16 wistar male rats were randomized in two groups: Group I (placebo) and Group II (Doxorubicin - 5mg/kg). After six months, the animals were subjected to cardiotomy and their hearts were weighted and submitted to transversal cuts, from which fragments for a macro and micro study were obtained. These fragments were studied considering their external and internal diameters and the thickness of the left ventricle (LV). The histological pieces were analyzed for the presence of fibrosis, cytoplasmic vacuolization, necrosis and size of nucleus variation. Data obtained was submitted to statistical analysis with Student's t test.
The hearts of the animals in Group II increased 41% in relation to their weight; 33% in the internal diameter and 14% in the external diameter of the LV cavity; and 24% in the thickness of the wall. Fibrosis of the myocardial tissue was observed in 75% of the animals of Group II; all the animals presented miocyte cytoplasmatic vacuolization; myocardial necrosis was present in 75% of the animals; and 87/% presented variation in the size of myocite nuclei. The presence of polymorphonuclear cells was also observed.
Doxorubicin was effective in the promotion of macro and microscopic alterations in the cardiac tissue of rats, possibly constituting a model for the experimental study of myocardiopathy.
Previous studies suggest that progesterone may possess neuroprotective properties after traumatic insult but, with the exception of reduced formation of cerebral oedema, limited experimental evidence has been presented to support this claim. In the present study we focused on the effect of progesterone treatment on structural and functional deficits in an experimental model of traumatic brain injury. Female mice exhibited significantly (P = 0.0445) reduced lesion volumes compared with males after aseptic cryogenic cerebral injury (ACI), suggesting that female sex steroids provide protection against this injury. In male mice, progesterone treatment after injury (three intraperitoneal doses of 8 mg/kg) reduced lesion volume (P = 0.0429) and improved performance in a spatial cognitive task (Morris water maze; P = 0.0014). However, progesterone had no demonstrable effect on the formation of oedema as measured using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, nor did it affect brain water content. The pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and growth factors BDNF and G-CSF, were all strongly transcriptionally activated after ACI. However, progesterone administration did not affect expression of these genes. This study provides strong evidence that progesterone possesses neuroprotective properties in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury, but suggests that the steroid achieves this effect through mechanism(s) independent of the inflammatory response or growth factor up-regulation.
Considering the role in the metabolism of chemicals played by biotransformation enzymes, we aimed at determining whether any association exists between genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A1, CYP2E1, epoxide hydrolase (EPHX), glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1/P1/T1) and individual susceptibility to lymphomas. PCR-RFLP-based genotyping assays were used to determine the frequency of polymorphisms in CYP1A1 (3'-flanking region), CYP2E1 (5'-flanking region and intron 6), EPHX (exons 3 and 4), GSTM1 (deletion), GSTP1 (exon 5) and GSTT1 (deletion) in a case-control study comprised of 219 patients with morbus Hodgkin (MH) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and 455 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. The distribution of genotypes in CYP2E1-intron 6 was significantly different between the control group and all lymphomas (P = 0.03), patients with NHL (P = 0.024), and especially aggressive diffuse NHL (P = 0.007). Grading of NHL seemed to be associated with this polymorphism as well (P = 0.041). The EPHX-exon 3 genotype distribution was significantly different between control males and males with all lymphomas (P = 0.01) or with NHL (P = 0.019). The Val/Val genotype of GSTP1-exon 5 was prevalent in all MH [odds ratio (OR) = 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-4.14] and this difference was particularly evident in females (OR = 2.97, 95% CI = 1.16-7.61). A significant difference in the distribution of GSTP1-exon 5 genotypes was found between NHL tumors >5 cm and those <5 cm (P = 0.03). The results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of biotransformation enzymes may play a significant role in the development of lymphoid malignancies.
Fibrin sealants (FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS.
FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia.
FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity.
Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.
To study the efficacy and safety of olanzapine for the treatment of children with autism associated with disruptive behavior problems.
A prospective open-label trial was conducted on 40 male children (mean age 12.2 +/- 2.2 years, range 7-17 years) meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV criteria for autism. After a washout period from previous medications (2-14 days), patients received olanzapine (5-10 mg/day) for a 13-week treatment period. The primary efficacy measures were Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) done at baseline and end of treatment. At the beginning and end of treatment, patients underwent laboratory and physical investigations: ECG, chest X-ray, urinalysis, serum chemistry, blood glucose and lipid profile, hematology and hepatitis B serology.
Paired comparison of baseline and 13-week endpoint scores showed significant reductions in ABC subscale scores for irritability (p < 0.0001), lethargy (p < 0.0001), stereotyped behavior (p < 0.005), hyperactivity (p < 0.0001) and inappropriate speech (p < 0.005). Of 40 patients, 12 (30%) were considered as 'improved' on CGI-S scores compared to baseline, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). No liver enzyme elevation or any other serum biochemical changes resulted from treatment, which was not associated with significant body weight changes or any other treatment-emergent side effects.
The study shows that olanzapine treatment can be beneficial in alleviating some behavioral symptoms (irritability, hyperactivity/noncompliance and lethargy/withdrawal) associated with autism. The short period of this trial limits inferences about adverse effects such as body weight increase and tardive dyskinesia. Further long-term placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine are required.
Thromboembolic complications occurred during diagnostic coronary arteriography in three patients in spite of systemic heparinization. These mishaps were associated with the use of a nonionic contrast medium, which is known not to have a significant protective effect on coagulation pathways. If nonionic contrast media are to be used in angiographic studies of critical organs, meticulous technique is imperative, and adequate systemic heparinization is recommended.
The present study was performed to determine the effect of combined intravenous and oral volume supplementation on the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Consecutive patients (n = 958) receiving iomeprol 350 during PCI were evaluated prospectively for the development of CIN. All patients received protocol-defined intravenous and oral volume supplementation. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 44 micromol/l within 48 h.
Of the 958 patients enrolled in the study, 147 (15%) were diabetic and 107 (11%) had stage III renal disease. The average baseline glomerular filtration rate was 88 +/- 25 ml/min/1.73 m(2). During the intervention an average of 238 +/- 86 ml of contrast medium was administered. CIN developed in 13 of 958 (1.4%; 95% confidence interval 0.6-2.1%) patients. The incidence of CIN was low even in predefined risk subgroups (women: 2.4%, diabetics: 2.7%, patients with stage III kidney disease: 6.5%).
The incidence of CIN is low when preprocedural fluid volume supplementation is used.
In the present study, we have characterized properties of steroid withdrawal using a pseudopregnant rat model. This paradigm results in increased production of endogenous progesterone from ovarian sources and as such is a useful physiological model. "Withdrawal" from progesterone induced by ovariectomy on day 12 of pseudopregnancy resulted in increased anxiety, as determined by a decrease in open arm entries on the elevated plus maze compared to control rats and pseudopregnant animals not undergoing withdrawal. Similar findings were obtained 24 hr after administration of a 5alpha-reductase blocker to a pseudopregnant animal, suggesting that it is the GABAA-modulatory 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha, 5alpha-THP) that produces anxiogenic withdrawal symptoms. Twenty-four hours after steroid withdrawal, the time constant for decay of GABAA-gated current was also reduced sixfold, assessed using whole- cell patch-clamp procedures on pyramidal neurons acutely dissociated from CA1 hippocampus. Thus, 3alpha,5alpha-THP withdrawal results in a marked decrease in total GABAA current, a possible mechanism for its anxiogenic, proconvulsant sequelae. In addition, 3alpha,5alpha-THP withdrawal resulted in insensitivity to the normally potentiating effect of the benzodiazepine lorazepam (LZM) on GABAA-gated Cl- current. This withdrawal profile is similar to that reported for other GABAA-modulatory drugs such as the benzodiazepines (BDZs), barbiturates, and ethanol. These changes were also associated with significant two and threefold increases in both the mRNA and protein for the alpha4 subunit of the GABAA receptor, respectively, in hippocampus. The pseudopregnancy paradigm may be a useful model for periods of endogenous 3alpha,5alpha-THP withdrawal such as premenstrual syndrome and postpartum or postmenopausal dysphoria, when increased emotional lability and BDZ insensitivity have been reported.
Hexavalent chromium (Cr-VI) is used in a wide range of industries. Cr-VI from chromate industries and atmospheric emissions contribute to the Cr contamination in the environment. Cr is a reproductive metal toxicant that can traverse the placental barrier and cause a wide range of fetal effects including ovotoxicity. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the basic mechanisms involved in Cr(VI)-induced ovotoxicity, and the protective role of vitamin C on ovarian follicular development and function in Cr(VI)-induced reproductive toxicity using both in vivo and in vitro approaches. Lactating rats received potassium dichromate (200 mg/L) with or without vitamin C (500 mg/L), through drinking water from postpartum days 1-21. During postnatal days (PND) 1-21 the pups received Cr(VI) via the mother's milk. Pups from both control and treatment groups were continued on regular diet and water from PND-21 onwards, and euthanized on PND-21, -45 and -65. Cr(VI) decreased steroidogenesis, GH and PRL, increased FSH and did not alter LH. Cr(VI) delayed puberty, decreased follicle number, and extended estrous cycle. Spontaneously immortalized rat granulosa cells were treated with 12.5 microM (IC(50)) potassium dichromate for 12 and 24 h, with or without vitamin C pre-treatment. Cr(VI) decreased the mRNA expressions of StAR, SF-1, 17beta-HSD-1, 17beta-HSD-2, FSHR, LHR, ER alpha and ER beta. Vitamin C pre-treatment protected ovary and granulosa cells from the deleterious effects of Cr(VI) toxicity, both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, Cr(VI) toxicity could be a potential risk to the reproductive system in developing females, and vitamin C plays a protective role against Cr(VI)-induced ovotoxicity.
The antianginal efficacies of nifedipine (40 to 120 mg/day) and diltiazem (120 to 360 mg/day) were studied in 21 normotensive patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Patients received each agent titrated to maximum tolerated doses for 6 weeks, after a 2-week placebo baseline period. The maximum tolerated dose for nifedipine was 72 +/- 8 (standard error) mg/day and for diltiazem 297 +/- 20 mg/day. Two patients discontinued nifedipine early because of side effects. Duration of symptom-limited treadmill exercise was longer during the nifedipine (556 +/- 43 seconds) and diltiazem periods (546 +/- 39 seconds) compared with placebo baseline (474 +/- 41 seconds, p less than 0.02). Compared with placebo, nifedipine caused a significant increase in heart rate both at rest standing and at peak exercise. Nifedipine decreased resting systolic blood pressure but had no effect at peak exercise. In contrast, diltiazem caused a significant decrease in heart rate at rest but had no effect on blood pressure at rest or at peak exercise. Thus, nifedipine and diltiazem have differential effects on heart rate and systolic blood pressure suggesting different modes of action. However, despite the increase in exercise duration, neither nifedipine nor diltiazem increased the heart rate-systolic pressure product during maximum exercise. This suggests that the antianginal effects of the 2 agents probably are mediated via reduction of myocardial oxygen demand at submaximal exercise. In addition, diltiazem appears to be better tolerated than nifedipine.
Oxidative stress is implicated in hyperglycemia-induced alterations in cell signaling pathways. We examined the toxicity of high glucose in primary rat hepatocytes and its amelioration by naringenin. Incubation of hepatocytes with 40 mM glucose for 1.5 h exhibited significant decrease in cell viability confirmed by MTT reduction and Alamar blue assay. At the same time primary rat hepatocytes exhibited significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential indicating organelle dysfunction. Enhanced translocation of Cyt-c from mitochondria to cytosol and AIF/Endo-G from mitochondria to nucleus, activation of caspase-9/3, DNA damage, and chromatin condensation were observed in glucose-stressed hepatocytes, indicating the involvement of mitochondrial pathway in high glucose-induced apoptosis. Transcript levels of antioxidant enzymes were significantly altered along with corresponding changes in their enzymatic activities. The level of intracellular antioxidant glutathione as well as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities were observed to be significantly decreased in hepatocytes treated with high concentration of glucose. Naringenin, a flavanone, was effective in preventing loss of cell viability, reactive oxygen species generation, and decline in antioxidant defense. Translocation of AIF, Endo-G, and Cyt-c from mitochondria was also inhibited by naringenin in glucose-stressed cells. Messenger RNA expression of anti-apoptotic and apoptotic genes, externalization of phosphatidyl serine, DNA damage, chromatin condensation, and sub-diploid cell population were effectively altered by naringenin indicating its anti-apoptotic potential in vitro. Our data suggests that naringenin can prevent apoptosis induced by high glucose through scavenging of reactive oxygen species and modulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.
Cocaine intoxication is a common cause of agitation in emergency department patients. Ziprasidone, an atypical antipsychotic, is being increasingly used for sedation of agitated patients in the emergency department.
To provide preliminary animal data on the efficacy of ziprasidone for the treatment of acute cocaine poisoning.
This was a randomized, blinded comparison of ziprasidone and placebo for the prevention of seizures and apparent lethality in a mouse model of cocaine intoxication. Animals were assigned to either placebo or 0.4 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/m(2) of ziprasidone intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to administration of 105 mg/kg of cocaine. Study outcomes were the proportions of animals having seizures and the apparent lethality.
1.2 mg/m(2) of ziprasidone decreased the lethal effects of cocaine by 50%, while 0.4 mg/kg decreased lethality by 13%. There was no effect on seizures at either dose.
Ziprasidone pretreatment decreased lethality in this mouse model of severe cocaine intoxication.
Hypotension produced by sodium nitroprusside during halothane anaesthesia in a series of experiments in dogs was accompanied by the maintenance of renal blood flow. Renal blood flow was maintained at levels of systemic pressure at which flow is customarily reduced in man and experimental animals. The significance of this observation is the possibility that sodium nitroprusside has a protective effect on the kidney, not only in states of deliberate hypotension, but in other low flow states where renal perfusion and function may be compromised.
Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a human autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of aldolase B that results in an inability to metabolize fructose and related sugars. We report here the first identification of a molecular lesion in the aldolase B gene of an affected individual whose defective protein has previously been characterized. The mutation is a G----C transversion in exon 5 that creates a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Ahall and results in an amino acid substitution (Ala----Pro) at position 149 of the protein within a region critical for substrate binding. Utilizing this novel restriction site and the polymerase chain reaction, the patient was shown to be homozygous for the mutation. Three other HFI patients from pedigrees unrelated to this individual were found to have the same mutation: two were homozygous and one was heterozygous. We suggest that this genetic lesion is a prevailing cause of hereditary fructose intolerance.
A 71-year-old woman with a 25-year history of levodopa (LD)-responsive Parkinson's disease (PD) developed on-off motor fluctuation and severe peak dose dyskinesia. She underwent deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS). STN-DBS induced attenuation of her cardinal PD symptoms and marked improvement of dyskinesia without reduction of LD dosage perioperatively. STN-DBS thus markedly attenuated the cardinal symptoms of PD. LD-induced dyskinesia can also be controlled via reduction of LD dosage as an indirect effect of STN-DBS. The present case provides evidence of the direct antidyskinetic effect of STN-DBS, and suggests that LD-induced dyskinesia can be inhibited by stimulation in the area above the STN.
Genetic factors can influence antihypertensive response to metoprolol, and many studies focused on the relationship between the genotype in beta1-adrenergic receptor and blood pressure (BP), little was known about the association of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype with the therapeutic result of metoprolol. The present study aimed to investigate whether the ACE gene insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism is related to the response to metoprolol in Chinese Han hypertensive patients.
Ninety-six patients with essential hypertension received metoprolol (100 mg once daily) as monotherapy for 8 weeks. Twenty-four hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and dynamic electrocardiogram were performed before and after treatment. Genotyping analysis was performed using PCR. The association of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism with variations in BP and heart rate (HR) was observed after the 8-week treatment.
The patients with ACE gene II polymorphism showed greater reduction in 24-hour average HR than those with ID or DD polymorphisms (P = 0.045), no effect of this genotype on the reduction in seating HR or in BP was observed. After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, BP and HR at baseline, the ACE gene I/D polymorphism was still an independent predictor for variations in 24-hour average HR.
The II polymorphism in ACE gene could be a candidate predictor for greater reduction in 24-hour average HR in Chinese Han hypertensive patients treated by metoprolol. Greater benefits would be obtained by patients with II polymorphism from the treatment with metoprolol. Larger studies are warranted to validate this finding.
Epoxy resin compounds (ERC) include a large number of chemicals, such as epoxy resins (ER), reactive diluents and hardeners. Many hardeners, e.g., aliphatic polyamines, are well-known sensitizers. Another type of ER hardeners are the phthalic anhydrides, such as methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) and methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride (MTHPA), which have been reported as causing immunologically-mediated respiratory diseases and contact urticaria, but not allergic contact dermatitis. Here, we present a horizontal boring-machine worker who developed allergic contact dermatitis, as well as allergic rhinitis and an immediate contact skin reaction from MHHPA. Patch testing with a dilution series of MHHPA in pet. elicited the following results: 2%, 1% and 0.5%, +2; 0.25% and 0.125%, + (3- to 6-day readings). An immunohistochemical and electron microscopic study also indicated that the patch test reactions were conventional-delayed allergic reactions. Interleukin 8 was observed in the epidermal cells, whereas interleukin 4 immunoreactivity was detected in the dermal cells. Immunoreactivity to-interleukin 5, granulocyte/macrophage-colophony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or eosinophil cationic protein was not seen. In conclusion, the patient developed both Type I and Type IV allergy to MHHPA. The clinical data, patch test results, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic observations indicated that the MHHPA allergy detected by the patch test reaction was a conventional delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. The patient also had an allergic patch test reaction to para-phenylenediamine and diaminodiphenylmethane, possibly representing occupational sensitization.
