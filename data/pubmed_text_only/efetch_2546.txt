The objective of this study was to examine the effects of prenatal cocaine and polydrug exposure on language development of preschool children using a prospective longitudinal model, controlling for confounders.
Children who were exposed to cocaine in utero (n = 209) and nonexposed children (n = 189) were followed prospectively at birth and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 years of age and were compared on receptive, expressive, and total language scores across time using random coefficient models, controlling for confounders.
A significant, stable effect of cocaine exposure on language development was observed over time for all language domains, with cocaine exposure related to poorer language performance. Cigarette exposure was related to lower receptive language scores. Environmental influences on language scores were also observed. Both the cocaine-exposed and nonexposed children declined in language performance over time.
Prenatal cocaine exposure has a stable negative effect on language skills during the first 6 years of life. Both cocaine-exposed and nonexposed children showed decreased language growth over time; however, cocaine-exposed children demonstrated linguistic deficits compared with nonexposed peers and did not catch up. Cigarette and environmental influences were also noted.
Two cases of widespread cutaneous vasculitis are described in association with diltiazem, a recently introduced calcium antagonist. In both cases, spontaneous resolution occurred over several weeks following withdrawal of the drug.
Misexpression and cytosolic retention of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) within Schwann cells (SCs) is associated with a genetically heterogeneous group of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies. PMP22 overproducer C22 and spontaneous mutant Trembler J (TrJ) mice display neuropathic phenotypes and affected nerves contain abnormally localized PMP22. Nutrient deprivation-induced autophagy is able to suppress the formation of PMP22 aggregates in a toxin-induced cellular model, and improve locomotor performance and myelination in TrJ mice. As a step toward therapies, we assessed whether pharmacological activation of autophagy by rapamycin (RM) could facilitate the processing of PMP22 within neuropathic SCs and enhance their capacity to myelinate peripheral axons. Exposure of mouse SCs to RM induced autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner and decreased the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated substrates. The treatment of myelinating dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explant cultures from neuropathic mice with RM (25 nm) improved the processing of PMP22 and increased the abundance and length of myelin internodes, as well as the expression of myelin proteins. Notably, RM is similarly effective in both the C22 and TrJ model, signifying that the benefit overlaps among distinct genetic models of PMP22 neuropathies. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated shRNA knockdown of the autophagy-related gene 12 (Atg12) abolished the activation of autophagy and the increase in myelin proteins, demonstrating that autophagy is critical for the observed improvement. Together, these results support the potential use of RM and other autophagy-enhancing compounds as therapeutic agents for PMP22-associated demyelinating neuropathies.
Human tissue kallikreins (hKs) are a family of fifteen serine proteases. Several lines of evidence suggest that hKs participate in proteolytic cascade pathways. Human kallikrein 5 (hK5) has trypsin-like activity, is able to self-activate, and is co-expressed in various tissues with other hKs. In this study, we examined the ability of hK5 to activate other hKs. By using synthetic heptapeptides that encompass the activation site of each kallikrein and recombinant pro-hKs, we demonstrated that hK5 is able to activate pro-hK2 and pro-hK3. We then showed that, following their activation, hK5 can internally cleave and deactivate hK2 and hK3. Given the predominant expression of hK2 and hK3 in the prostate, we examined the pathophysiological role of hK5 in this tissue. We studied the regulation of hK5 activity by cations (Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na2+, and K+) and citrate and showed that Zn can efficiently inhibit hK5 activity at levels well below its normal concentration in the prostate. We also show that hK5 can degrade semenogelins I and II, the major components of the seminal clot. Semenogelins can reverse the inhibition of hK5 by Zn2+, providing a novel regulatory mechanism of its serine protease activity. hK5 is also able to internally cleave insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, but not 6, suggesting that it might be involved in prostate cancer progression through growth factor regulation. Our results uncover a kallikrein proteolytic cascade pathway in the prostate that participates in seminal clot liquefaction and probably in prostate cancer progression.
Seizure activity can alter GABA transporter and osmoprotective gene expression, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. However, the response of the betaine/GABA transporter (BGT1) is unknown. The goal of the present study was to compare the expression of BGT1 mRNA to that of other osmoprotective genes and GABA transporters following status epilepticus (SE). The possible contributory role of dehydration and inflammation was also investigated because both have been shown to be involved in the regulation of GABA transporter and/or osmoprotective gene expression. BGT1 mRNA was increased 24 h post-SE, as were osmoprotective genes. BGT1 was decreased 72 h and 4 weeks post-SE, as were the GABA transporter mRNAs. The mRNA values for osmoprotective genes following 24-h water withdrawal were significantly lower than the values obtained 24 h post-SE despite similarities in their plasma osmolality values. BGT1 mRNA was not altered by lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation while the transcription factor tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein and the GABA transporters 1 and 3 were. These results suggest that neither plasma osmolality nor inflammation fully account for the changes seen in BGT1 mRNA expression post-SE. However, it is evident that BGT1 mRNA expression is altered by SE and displays a temporal pattern with similarities to both GABA and osmolyte transporters. Further investigation of BGT1 regulation in the brain is warranted.
4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) is an orphan drug indicated for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders. There is a great controversy around the use of this drug because of its narrow safety index and because a large number of adverse effects have been reported. Moreover, it was shown to induce cell death in different cell lines, being reported mainly apoptosis and necrosis as the principal pathways of cell death mediated by blockage of K channels or the Na, K-ATPase, but until now it was not described in vivo cell death induced by 4-aminipyridine. To provide new subchronic toxicity data and specifically, evaluate if 4-AP is able to induce in vivo cell death process and the main pathways related to it, a repeated dose (28 days) oral toxicity study, at therapeutic range of doses, was conducted in rats. The anatomical pathology, the biochemical and hematological parameters were analyzed and a real-time PCR array analysis was developed with an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The leucocytes number, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzymatic activity were increased at all dose but the erythrocytes number, the hemoglobin concentration, the alkaline phosphatase (FAL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymatic activity were increased only at highest dose studied. However, glucose levels decreased at all doses. The biochemical results are indicative of hepatic damage. The anatomy pathology studies showed cell death only on liver and kidney, and the real-time PCR array on liver tissue expressed a gene expression profile of necrotic and apoptotic induced cell death. The present work shows for the first time in vivo cell death on liver and kidney with features of apoptosis and necrosis induced by 4-AP and the gene expression profile shows that the cell death is mediated by necrotic and apoptotic pathways that support this finding.
The physician population delivering obstetric care in Philadelphia between 1950 and 1970 was contacted to ascertain their use of diethylstilbesterol (DES) during pregnancy. Of the 31.8% of the physicians who responded to the questionnaire, 71.8% used DES during pregnancy and 12.7% desired assistance in review of their records. During the 6 years from the initial survey, 830 young women exposed to DES in utero were periodically screened for cervicovaginal abnormalities and clear cell adenocarcinoma. Of these 830 patients 61.7% were found to have cervicovaginal abnormalities, and 65.9% of the patients showed either adenosis or evidence of the prior existence of vaginal adenosis. Eight patients were treated for clear cell adenocarcinoma. Two cases were detected while asymptomatic. Seven of the patients are living with no evidence of cancer, and two of these have survived over 5 years.
A project, designed to locate the population at risk to diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in utero in the greater Philadelphia area from 1950-1970, was implemented by contacting area physicians who might have used the drug in their practices on pregnant women. 216 (31.8%) physicians responded to the questionaire; 155 (71.8%) responded that they had used DES. During the 6 years from initial survey, 830 young women exposed to DES in utero were periodically screened for cervicovaginal abnormalities and clear cell adenocarcinoma. Gross structural cervicovaginal abnormalities were found in 512 (61.7%) of the individuals evaluated. In 38 patients, vaginal adenosis existing alone was documented. In another 279 patients, metaplasia alone was noted in the vagina, and in another 230 patients, both metaplasia and adenosis coexisting in varying degrees were found. Thus, 547 (65.9%) showed either adenosis or evidence of the prior existence of vaginal adenosis. 8 patients with clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina or cervix were seen; each individual was born during the decade of the 1950s. 2 cases were detected while asymptomatic; 7 of the patients are living with no evidence of cancer, and 2 of these have survived over 5 years. These results showed a much lower incidence of significant dysplastic squamous changes (1.1%) than that of earlier reports, emphasizing the subjective element of earlier, more alarming reports.
The activin-follistatin system is a potent growth regulatory system of liver tissue homeostasis. Activin A inhibits hepatocellular DNA synthesis and induces cell death. Follistatin binds activin and sequesters it from the signaling pathway. Consistently, follistatin has been reported to act as an inducer of DNA synthesis in the liver. Using RNase protection analysis, we studied the expression of follistatin in rat and mouse liver tumors as a possible mechanism to overcome activin growth control. Approximately 40% of the tumors (nine of 24 each), most of them hepatocellular carcinomas, displayed increased levels of follistatin mRNA when compared to tumor-surrounding liver tissue. The degree of overexpression was highly variable but independent of the carcinogen treatment that animals had received. It was also independent from the histological stage of malignancy and further found in rat liver adenomas. Follistatin expression was also observed in cell lines derived from human hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of follistatin may represent a unique strategy of hepatic tumors to overcome the inhibitory action of a growth factor, activin, by decreasing its local bioavailability.
The cerebral pathology in a case of tricyclic antidepressant overdose by amitriptyline is described. A review of the literature of similar cases is summarized. The relation of the cerebral lesions to the development of a hypertensive episode possibly induced by amitriptyline is discussed.
Use of illicit drugs results in an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, which is often seen in the Emergency Department (ED). Chest pain is frequently associated with cocaine and methamphetamine use.
To determine if the self-report of recent cocaine or methamphetamine use is reliable in illicit stimulant drug users who present to the ED with chest pain.
A retrospective review of patients presenting to the ED from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006 was undertaken. Inclusion criteria were: age >or= 18 years, chief complaint of chest pain, documented social history of drug abuse, positive urine toxicology screen and myoglobin and troponin levels measured, sent from the ED.
For the 318 patients who met the inclusion criteria, the self-report rate of cocaine or methamphetamine use was 51.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.57). No difference was found in the self-report rate between users of methamphetamine vs. cocaine (odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% CI 0.7-1.7). There also was no difference in the self-report rate by patient age < 50 years compared to patient age >or= 50 years (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42-1.08). The self-report rate for males compared to females was not significantly different (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54-1.4). Patients who had a positive troponin were not significantly more likely to self-report drug use than patients who did not have a positive troponin (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.55-2.2).
The self-report rate among cocaine- or methamphetamine-using patients presenting to the ED with chest pain was 51.8%. There seems to be no significant difference in the self-report rate among those who use methamphetamine vs. those who use cocaine, nor by gender, nor stratified by age over 50 years.
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from an unusual genetic mechanism. The mutation, a deletion of 3.3 kb subtelomeric repeats, appears to disrupt the regional regulation of 4q35 g ene expression. The specific gene(s)responsible for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy have not been identified. However, the 'vacuolar/necrotic' phenotype exhibited by facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy myoblasts suggests that aberrant gene expression occurs early in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy muscle development. In order to test this hypothesis, global gene expression profiling and in vitro characterization of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and control myoblasts were carried out. Genes involved in several cellular processes such as oxidative stress were found to be dysregulated. In vitro studies confirmed this susceptibility to oxidative stress, as proliferative stage facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy myoblasts exhibit greatly reduced viability when exposed to the oxidative stressor paraquat. This effect was not seen in either normal or disease control myoblasts, or in any of the cell lines upon differentiation to multinucleated myotubes. Immunocytochemical studies of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 demonstrated increased expression in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy myoblasts, suggesting an early cell cycle arrest. Another process distinguishing facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy from controls involves the transcription of extracellular matrix components. Expression of elastin, decorin, lumican and the extracellular matrix remodeling factor TIMP3 were reduced in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy myoblasts. These studies suggest that facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy muscular dystrophy results from a defect in early myogenesis, manifested as increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, morphological aberrations and early cell cycle arrest.
To examine a group of women (third-generation daughters) whose mothers were exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol (DES) and compare their findings on pelvic examination with those noted in their mothers.
Letters were mailed to women documented to have been exposed in utero to DES who had given birth to a female offspring, inviting them to have their daughters come in for a detailed history and pelvic examination. Records of the mothers whose daughters appeared for examination were reviewed, and findings noted at the time of their initial examination were recorded. Detailed pelvic examination of the third-generation daughters included colposcopic examination and iodine staining of the vagina and cervix and Papanicolaou smear. The findings observed in these women were compared with those noted in their mothers at the time of their mothers' first examination.
Twenty-eight third-generation daughters were examined. Three of the daughters were delivered from one mother. Review of the mothers' records indicated that 16 (61.5%) of the mothers exposed to DES during their pregnancy demonstrated structural changes of the cervix, upper vagina, or vaginal epithelial changes consisting of adenosis, nonstaining vaginal epithelium after application of iodine solution, or white epithelium within the vagina. None of the daughters were found to have changes usually associated with DES exposure.
The absence of abnormalities in the lower genital tract in third-generation women compared with the high frequency of these abnormalities in their mothers suggests that third-generation carryover effects of in utero DES exposure are unlikely.
Members of the cyclooxygenase (COX) family are known to catalyze the rate-limiting steps of prostaglandins synthesis and reported to be involved in neuropathic pain. Diabetic neuropathy is a type of neuropathic pain, though it is not clear if COX is relevant to the condition. Recently, spinal COX-2 protein was found to be increasing in streptozotocin-induced rats as compared to the constitutive expression. We attempted to determine which cyclooxygenase isoforms are involved in streptozotocin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, which was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg of streptozotocin. Intrathecal administrations of the COX-2 inhibitors SC-58125 (7-100 microg) and NS-398 (7-60 microg), as well as a high dose (100 microg) of the COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 attenuated hyperalgesia, whereas intrathecal administrations of a low dose (10 microg) of SC-560 and the COX-3 inhibitor acetaminophen (1-7 mg) did not. Further, intrathecal administration of SC-58125 (100 microg) did not produce an analgesic effect in normal rats. These results indicate that intrathecal administration of COX-2 inhibitors has an anti-hyperalgesic effect on streptozotocin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and we concluded that spinal COX-2 is pivotal in streptozotocin-induced hyperalgesia.
In 31 patients with paroxysm-like progressive and 19 with continuously progressive paranoid schizophrenia the authors examined the results of long-term (from 4 to 11 years) treatment with moditen depot. The mean dosage of the drug was 25-50 mg per 3-4 weeks. A good therapeutic response was observed in more than half the cases. In group I patients it was expressed in the absence of relapses, improvement of quality and increase in the duration of the remissions; in group II it was expressed in an increased tendency toward a regressing course with a reduced intensity of processional manifestations. A favourable effect was accompanied by improved social and occupational adaptation of patients.
The study was aimed to show whether the renin-angiotensin system acts on erythropoiesis in chronic renal failure patients with hemodialysis, since captopril leads to the worsening of anemia in such patients. The average dose of captopril in 13 cases studied was 19.3 mg per day and duration of the administration was 48 days. Blood-pressure fall by captopril was accompanied with the worsening of anemia. There were significant decreases in hemoglobin (8.3%), hematocrit (7.3%), red blood cell count (7.6%) and reticulocyte count (43.7%). Angiotensin II was significantly decreased (15.7%) with significant reductions of plasma aldosterone concentration (15.2%) and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (45.7%), and with significant increases in plasma renin activity (158.6%) and in angiotensin I (238.3%). However, plasma erythropoietin concentration remained unchanged. Serum iron concentration was slightly but significantly increased after captopril. Reticulocyte count was significantly correlated with AII either before (r = 0.716, p less than 0.01) or after captopril (r = 0.658, p less than 0.05). There was significant correlation between angiotensin II and red blood cell count before captopril (r = 0.710, p less than 0.01). It is concluded from the present study that the reduction of angiotensin II by captopril might contribute to the worsening of anemia seen in chronic hemodialysis patients.
Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may cause angio-oedema. To see if this might be due to potentiation of the tissue effects of bradykinin the thickness of weals raised by intradermal injection of saline or 1, 3, or 10 micrograms bradykinin was measured before and three times after single doses of captopril, enalapril, or placebo. The mean thickness increased with increasing doses of bradykinin. It did not change with time after the administration of placebo or captopril but increased from 0.61 mm before enalapril to 1.12 mm two and a half hours and 1.06 mm five hours after enalapril was given. Five subjects flushed when given bradykinin after captopril and four after enalapril, but none flushed when given bradykinin after placebo. It is concluded that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors potentiate the effects of intradermal bradykinin in vivo and that this may partially explain why they cause angio-oedema in susceptible patients.
Two patients harboring invasive macroprolactinomas, on treatment with bromocriptine, developed cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea 16 and 17 months after the beginning of the medical therapy. Neither patient had previously been submitted to surgery or radiotherapy. The fistulae were surgically corrected. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage is a well-documented complication of pituitary tumors, mainly after surgery and/or radiotherapy, but the reports of its occurrence after primary treatment with bromocriptine are rare. Therefore, the possibility of this complication must be considered, especially in patients with invasive macroprolactinomas.
Salbutamol in controlled release tablet form was compared to salbutamol in standard tablet form for the management of patients with bronchial asthma. A total of twenty asthmatic patients enrolled in the study were classified into two groups, ten patients each, for a cross-over study. Group 1 received controlled release tablets for a 2 to 3 week period, and were then shifted to standard tablets for another similar period. Group 2 received standard tablets first and was then shifted to controlled release tablets. Patients were required to record symptom scores during therapy, including sleep disturbance, chest tightness, wheezing, cough, sputum production and inhalational bronchodilator use. Measurements of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were also done, as well as record made of side effects experienced. The result showed that a lower symptom score was found in patients receiving controlled release tablets than in patients receiving standard tablets (p < 0.001 for sleep disturbance, p < 0.005 for sputum formation and p < 0.001 for total score). There was a higher PEFR in patients receiving controlled-release tablets than in patients receiving standard tablets (p < 0.001). Side effects with tremor were observed in 30% of both groups of patients with a slightly higher degree in the patients receiving standard tablets (statistically not significant). In conclusion, salbutamol of controlled release tablet form obtains a better therapeutic response than standard tablets in the management of patients with bronchial asthma.
Reduced expression of BRCA1 protein, caused by the hypermethylation of its gene promoter and by other mechanisms, is observed in most sporadic human breast cancers, whereas its somatic mutations are rare. In the present study, we demonstrate that immunoreactivity of Brca1 was reduced in almost all rat mammary carcinomas induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), whereas hypermethylation of its promoter, mutations in its entire coding region, and decreased mRNA expression were absent. Using two kinds of polyclonal antibodies against human BRCA1 that recognized the N and C termini, respectively, immunoreactivity of Brca1 was found to be reduced in all 17 carcinomas examined and, especially, to be almost completely lost in 8 or 10 carcinomas. The reduction was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of five mammary carcinomas and normal mammary epithelial cells. Sequencing of the Brca1 promoter region after bisulfite modification in 10 PhIP-induced mammary carcinomas showed that the region was completely unmethylated in all of them. No mutations were detected in the entire coding region by direct sequencing of the Brca1 cDNA. Decrease in mRNA levels was not detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These data suggested that PhIP-induced mammary carcinomas could model human breast cancers that show reduced BRCA1 immunoreactivity without promoter hypermethylation and with normal mRNA expression. As underlying mechanisms, alterations in posttranscriptional regulation or stability of Brca1 protein were suggested.
Delirium or acute confusional state among hospitalized patients is a frequent and serious problem. It is characterized by acute onset symptoms, fluctuating course, impaired attention, unorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. Delirium, as a manifestation of acute nicotine withdrawal syndrome has been reported in the reviewed literature only in eight cases. We report the case of a heavy smoker admitted because of a reagudization of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. At the third day of nicotine abstinence, he developed delirium with a rapid improvement of his symptoms after treatment with a transdermal nicotine patch. This description suggests that in hospitalized heavy smokers who develop delirium with agitation, a simple trial with a nicotine patch can offer a dramatic therapeutic response in a few hours, constituting additionally a confirmatory test. The recognition of delirium as a manifestation of nicotine withdrawal could allow to determine the origin of symptoms and to apply the appropriate therapy, in certain complex cases that now remain undiagnosed.
Ulcerative colitis is characterized by elevated rates of epithelial cell apoptosis, and an up-regulation of pro-apoptotic cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Recently, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been shown to promote apoptosis. In addition, pharmacologic ACE inhibition (ACE-I) both prevents apoptosis and reduces TNF-alpha expression in vitro. We hypothesized that ACE-I, using enalaprilat, would decrease colonic epithelial cell apoptosis and reduce colitis severity in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice. We assessed the severity of colitis, and colonic epithelial cell apoptosis, after administration of DSS. Mice were given either daily ACE-I treatment or daily placebo. ACE-I treatment markedly improved clinical outcomes. In addition, ACE-I treatment significantly reduced the maximum histopathologic colitis grade. ACE-I also dramatically reduced the epithelial apoptotic rate. To investigate the mechanism by which ACE-I reduced apoptosis; we measured TNF-alpha, Bcl-2, and Bax expression. TNF-alpha mRNA was significantly lower with ACE-I treatment compared to placebo at every time point, as was the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2. We conclude that ACE-I reduces the severity of DSS-induced colitis and reduces epithelial cell apoptosis.
To assess the visual function in epileptic patients who have received vigabatrin; to compare this with the visual function in similar epileptic patients who have never received vigabatrin; to investigate whether the severity of visual field defect (VFD) is related to the dose of vigabatrin; to consider other factors that may correlate with the severity of VFD.
21 consecutive patients who had taken vigabatrin at some time in their lives were enrolled from the epilepsy clinic of the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and were compared with a group of 11 otherwise similar patients with epilepsy who had never received vigabatrin. One patient taking vigabatrin was excluded from the study because her visual field results were unreliable because of multi-infarct dementia. 15 patients were taking vigabatrin at the time of the study (VC), the other five had taken vigabatrin some time in the past (VP). Each patient underwent static perimetry using either the two point or the three point full field 120 screening program on the Humphrey visual field analyser, followed by an ophthalmic examination to rule out ocular causes for VFDs. The visual fields from each patient were then analysed using a method devised to convert the VFD into percentage defect in both eyes. In patients with known cerebral pathology that may affect the visual pathway, only the unaffected homonymous hemifield was used.
Nine of 20 (45%) patients in the vigabatrin group (VC and VP) complained of blurring of vision compared with two of 11 (18%) controls. Four patients (20%) in the vigabatrin group described flickering lights compared with one control (9%). None had a posterior vitreous detachment. Three of 30 (7.5%) eyes in the VC group had distant visual acuity of 6/12 or worse compared with three of 22 (9%) controls and five of 30 (16.7%) had near visual acuity worse than N6 compared with one of 22 (4.5%) in the control group. A mean of 1.73 Ishihara plates were misread in VC patients compared with 0.2 in the VP group and 0.18 in the controls. 11 of 15 (73.3%) patients in the VC group had greater than 10% VFDs as opposed to one of 11 (9.1%) controls (chi(2) test, p=0. 002). In 12 of 15 (80%) VC patients the percentage VFD was greater in the nasal hemifields than the temporal hemifields compared with six of 11 (54.5%) controls. Significant correlation was found between the severity of VFD and the total dose of vigabatrin ingested for the 20 patients exposed to vigabatrin (VC and VP: Spearman correlation coefficient=0.525; p=0.002), for the 15 patients taking vigabatrin at the time of examination (VC: Spearman correlation coefficient=0.568; p=0.002).
This pilot study suggested that epileptic patients taking vigabatrin are at much higher risk of developing VFDs compared with epileptic patients on other antiepileptic drugs. The total ingested dose of vigabatrin correlated significantly with the severity of VFDs especially in those patients who had not stopped taking vigabatrin. In our group we found that those who had taken a total dose of 1500 g or more of vigabatrin were at risk of developing significant visual field defects.
We report a study performed to compare the time and plasma drug concentrations necessary to achieve a similar state of sedation after midazolam premedication given by various routes in children of 2-5 years old. Children were randomly allocated to one of three groups to receive midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 given intranasally, 0.5 mg.kg-1 given orally or 0.3 mg.kg-1 given rectally. Sedation was measured regularly until venepuncture was possible in a cooperative child. At this time, a first blood sample was taken to measure plasma concentration, followed by another 10 min later. Anaesthesia consisted of intravenous propofol supplemented with regional analgesia. At recovery from anaesthesia, a third blood sample was taken. Adequate sedation occurred sooner (7.7, SD 2.4 min) with intranasal than oral (12.5, SD 4.9 min) or rectal (16.3, SD 4.2 min) midazolam. The initial blood levels were lower when the drug was given by the alimentary routes despite higher doses (146, SD 51 ng.ml-1 in 11.5, SD 3.9 min; 104, SD 34 ng.ml-1 in 21 +/- 6 min; and 93, SD 63 ng.ml-1 in 23.1, SD 3.5 min for the intra nasal, rectal and oral routes respectively). Duration of surgical procedures, and of propofol infusion, and recovery from anaesthesia was similar for the three groups. The only problem arose in a 30-month-old boy in the intranasal group who developed respiratory depression with a plasma midazolam concentration of 169 ng.ml-1. Intranasal midazolam is an excellent alternative for rapid premedication provided that respiratory monitoring is used.
A 53-year-old male, without any prior history of psychosis, developed schizophrenia 4 days after starting low-dose bromocriptine therapy for a macroprolactinoma. Five days after discontinuation of this medication his mental status returned to normal. This case is reported in support of the dopamine hypothesis for the etiology of schizophrenia.
To report a patient with chronic blepharospasm possibly induced by the calcium-channel blocker cinnarizine.
A 53-year-old woman developed chronic blepharospasm during a prolonged therapy with calcium-channel blocker cinnarizine for the treatment of vertigo.
"Tardive blepharospasm" should be considered as a possible adverse effect of cinnarizine.
