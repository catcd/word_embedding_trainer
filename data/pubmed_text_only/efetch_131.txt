Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been associated with increased risk of congestive heart failure (CHF). We aimed to assess the impact of treatment with etoricoxib or diclofenac on risk of CHF relative to baseline risk factors.
We performed a multivariate analysis of 34 701 patients with arthritis receiving etoricoxib 60 or 90 mg, or diclofenac 150 mg, daily for a mean of 18 months, to assess the incidence of confirmed, adjudicated CHF events resulting in emergency room visit or hospitalization. Analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) between the levels of each risk marker for the incidence of CHF. Significant risk markers included history of CHF (HR: 6.69, 95% CI 3.59-12.47; P <0.0001), age > or = 65 years (2.56, 1.65-3.98; P <0.0001), and history of hypertension (1.83, 1.16-2.89; P = 0.0094) or diabetes (1.83, 1.15-2.94; P = 0.0116). Etoricoxib vs. diclofenac was a significant risk factor only when pooling the etoricoxib 90 mg cohorts (1.88; 1.13-3.10; P = 0.0143). Etoricoxib 60 mg did not significantly increase risk vs. diclofenac.
History of CHF was highly associated with risk for CHF hospitalization. Hypertension, diabetes, and older age also increased risk modestly. There appeared to be a dose-related increase in CHF with etoricoxib compared with diclofenac, which reached statistical significance when the etoricoxib 90 mg groups (osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) were pooled.
The purpose of the present studies was to find the cause of proteinuria, which is displayed in rats after one dose of adriamycin. The results show electrostatic (decreased amount of negative charges in glomerulus) and morphological damage of kidney filtration barriers, which causes increased permeability of basal membranes for proteins. An important part in etiology seems to played by free radicals, which arise in the process of adriamycin transformation.
Rosacea is a leading reason why people seek the care of a dermatologist, accounting for nearly 7 million office visits annually. Pharmacologic treatments include both topical and oral medications, which are increasingly being used in combination, especially at the outset of therapy. This exploratory study assesses the safety, effectiveness and speed of onset of two common topical agents for the treatment of rosacea--azelaic acid gel (AzA) 15% and metronidazole gel 1%--used in conjunction with anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline (40 mg once daily). Men and women (n = 207) with mild-to-moderate papulopustular rosacea were enrolled and randomized to receive either AzA gel 15% twice daily plus doxycycline 40 mg once daily (AzA group) or metronidazole gel 1% once daily plus doxycycline 40 mg once daily (Metro group) for 12 weeks. Both regimens were safe, efficacious and well tolerated. Efficacy parameters revealed a possible trend toward greater and earlier benefit with the AzA-based regimen than with the metronidazole-based regimen. These findings warrant further investigation in a sufficiently powered study.
We present evidence that the cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer lines, A2780S/CP1 (S/CP1), A2780S/CP3 (S/CP3) and A2780S/CP5 (S/CP5), derived by subjecting the sensitive A2780S ovarian cancer line to multiple rounds of cisplatin treatments followed by recovery and are resistant to 1, 3 and 5 μM cisplatin, respectively, have increased colony-forming ability and altered morphology that is consistent with enhanced motility, migration and invasiveness in vitro. The malignant phenotype progresses with increasing resistance and is associated with hyperactive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 and janus kinases (Jaks), aberrant signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 activation promoted by EGFR and Jaks, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro. Survivin and FLIP anti-apoptotic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase activities are also elevated in the resistant cells. Accordingly, the ectopic expression of constitutively-active Stat3C in the sensitive A2780S cells diminished cisplatin sensitivity. The inhibition of EGFR or Stat3 activity repressed Survivin, VEGF and Vimentin expression and the colony-forming potential, viability, motility and migration of the resistant cells, and sensitized them to cisplatin. Analysis of human ovarian cancer patients' tumor tissues shows aberrantly-active EGFR and Stat3 that in certain cases correlate with Vimentin over-expression. Intra-peritoneal mouse xenograft studies revealed, compared with the sensitive A2780S line that had low tumor incidence restricted to the ovary, a high tumor incidence for the resistant S/CP3 and S/CP5 lines that formed tumor nodules at several locations on the small intestine and colon, and which responded poorly to cisplatin, but were sensitive to concurrent treatment with cisplatin and EGFR or Stat3 inhibitor. Hyperactive EGFR signaling through Stat3 and the Jak-Stat3 activity together promote ovarian cancer progression to cisplatin resistance and therefore represent targets for preventing the development of cisplatin resistance and the recurrent disease during cisplatin therapy in ovarian cancer.
Chemotherapy of the central nervous system may cause neurotoxicity in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. We evaluated regional blood flow in a 6-year-old child presenting with akinetic mutism, using 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission tomography (SPECT) following high-dose intravenous methotrexate therapy. While findings in X-ray computerized tomography were decreased density in bilateral basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei with diffusely decreased attenuation of the periventricular white matter, a global, frontal dominant profoundly abnormal perfusion pattern involving both gray and white matter was observed in the SPECT study. Treatment of the central nervous system with high dose intravenous chemotherapy may cause profound abnormalities in white and gray matter blood flow and early assessment of the neurotoxicity may be identified by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in the pediatric age group.
Nimesulide is a widely prescribed nitroaromatic sulfoanilide-type nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that, despite its favorable safety profile, has been associated with rare cases of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Because reactive metabolites have been implicated in DILI, we aimed at investigating whether hepatic bioactivation of nimesulide produces a protein-reactive intermediate in hepatocytes. Also, we explored whether nimesulide can activate the transcription factor Nrf2 that would protect from drug-induced hepatocyte injury. We found that [(14)C]-nimesulide covalently bound to human liver microsomes (<50 pmol/mg under standard conditions) or immortalized human hepatocytes in a sulfaphenazole-sensitive, rifampicin-inducible manner; yet the overall extent of binding was modest. Although exposure of hepatocytes to nimesulide was not associated with increased net levels of superoxide anion, nimesulide (100 microM, 24 h) caused nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in a sulfaphenazole-sensitive manner, indicating a role of electrophilic metabolites. However, knockdown of Nrf2 with siRNA did not make the cells more sensitive to nimesulide-induced cell injury. Similarly, exposure of wild-type C57BL/6x129 Sv mice to nimesulide (100 mg/kg/day, po, for 5 days) was associated with nuclear translocation of immunoreactive Nrf2 in a small number of hepatocytes and induced >2-fold the expression levels of the Nrf2-target gene Nqo1 in wild-type but not Nrf2-null mice. Nimesulide administered to Nrf2(-/-) knockout mice did not cause increases in serum ALT activity or any apparent histopathological signs of liver injury. In conclusion, these data indicate that nimesulide is bioactivated by CYP2C to a protein-reactive electrophilic intermediate that activates the Nrf2 pathway even at nontoxic exposure levels.
The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of venous toxicity induced by vinorelbine administration in patients who received a preventive therapy with defibrotide.
From July 1996 to July 2002 we treated 203 patients with vinorelbine, 51 with vinorelbine alone and 152 with vinorelbine in combination with other drugs via peripheral vein infusion. Of the 203 patients, 123 were male and 80 female with a median age of 67 years (range 18 to 82 years), and 118 were chemotherapy-naive. Defibrotide was delivered i.v. at a dose of 400 mg in 250 ml normal saline. After infusion of 125 ml over about 15 min, vinorelbine mixed with 10 ml normal saline was delivered as quick brief repeated pulses over 5 min through the plastic tube, followed by infusion of the remaining defibrotide. The specific Rittenberg scale was used to assess venous irritation episodes.
Among a total of 1336 vinorelbine infusions, with a median of five infusions per patient, the incidence of venous irritation episodes graded according to Rittenberg scale was 1.1% (15), of which 0.6% (8) were grade 2 and 0.5% (7) grade 1. Globally, 15 patients (7.3%) developed venous toxicity after a median of 3 infusions (range 1-14), but no patient had more than one event.
Our findings support the use of defibrotide as an effective, safe and low-cost means for preventing vinorelbine-related venous damage.
Ozone is a commonly encountered environmental oxidant which has been linked to asthma exacerbation in epidemiological studies. Ozone induces airway inflammation and enhances response to inhaled allergen. It has been suggested that antioxidant therapy may minimize the adverse effects of ozone in asthma. We have previously shown that the antioxidant gamma-tocopherol (gammaT), an isoform of vitamin E, also has anti-inflammatory effects. We employed a Brown Norway rat model of ozone-enhanced allergic responses to test the therapeutic effects of gammaT on O(3)-induced airway inflammation. Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rats were intranasally challenged with 0 or 0.5% OVA on Days 1 and 2, and exposed to 0 or 1 ppm ozone (8 h/day) on Days 4 and 5. Rats were also given 0 or 100 mg/kg gammaT on Days 2 through 5. Pulmonary tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected on Day 6. OVA challenge caused increased total cells (267% increase) and eosinophils (4000%) in BALF that was unaffected by ozone exposure. Morphometric evaluation of lung tissue revealed increases in intraepithelial mucosubstances (IM) (300%) and subepithelial eosinophils (400%) in main axial airways. Ozone exposure of allergic rats enhanced IM increases in proximal axial airways (200%), induced cys-leukotrienes, MCP-1, and IL-6 production in BALF, and upregulated expression of IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA. gammaT treatment had no effect on IM increases by allergen, but blocked enhancement by ozone. gammaT attenuated both OVA- or ozone-stimulated eosinophilic infiltration, and increases of BALF cys-leukotrienes, MCP-1, and IL-6, as well as IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA. These data demonstrate broad anti-inflammatory effects of a gammaT and suggest that it may be an effective therapy of allergic airway inflammation.
Two paediatric cases are reported in which unexpected, life-threatening arrhythmias occurred. Routine induction of general anaesthesia with thiopentone, 5 mg.kg-1, in one and with halothane in the other, and succinylcholine 1.25-1.5 mg.kg-1 i.v. was followed by the development of wide complex tachyarrhythmia with hypotension in the first case and asystole in the second case despite pre-treatment with atropine in both cases. The first patient was resuscitated with tracheal intubation, 100% oxygen, manual ventilation and intravenous lidocaine and bicarbonate. The second patient required intubation, manual ventilation, 12 min of CPR and i.v. calcium, epinephrine and bicarbonate, as well as DC counter shock. Neither patient received dantrolene. Early recovery in both patients was uneventful with no neurological sequelae. Subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy respectively, previously unsuspected, in both patients. The aetiology of the observed arrhythmias was presumably hyperkalaemia, secondary to succinylcholine-induced rhabdomyolysis. It is suggested that when faced with sudden, life-threatening arrhythmias following succinylcholine at induction of anaesthesia for paediatric patients, clinicians should include occult myopathy in the differential diagnosis, and thus consider the aggressive management of hyperkalaemia in addition to basic resuscitative efforts.
Lamivudine is a safe, effective treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after renal transplantation. However, prolonged lamivudine therapy can produce resistance to the drug. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with lamivudine resistance, but there is limited clinical experience in patients with either renal transplants or severe renal insufficiency. A 47-year-old man with asymptomatic HBV infection underwent renal transplantation in November 1995. In September 2000 lamivudine therapy was initiated to treat HBV reactivation. The outcome was good, with negative HBV DNA levels. Two years later, significant viral replication developed again. At that time the patient already had advanced renal insufficiency due to chronic graft nephropathy. The transaminase levels were increased, and the HBV DNA reached greater than 200,000 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction, with development of ascites and cirrhosis. The patient was started on ADV 10 mg every 72 hours (dose adjusted to renal function). There was rapid normalization of hepatic enzymes and progressive decline of the viral load. HBV DNA became negative after 6 months of ADV treatment. The renal function has since remained stable. This case suggests that ADV can be safe and effective in the treatment of renal transplant patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B, even in the presence of advanced renal insufficiency.
We have recently shown that acetaminophen induces many of the apoptotic traits in hepatoma cells and lymphocytes (Boulares et al. (2002d). In an effort to further investigate the mechanism by which non-metabolized acetaminophen induces apoptosis, we have now examined the roles of caspase-3, the DNA fragmentation factor, and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-regulated Ca2+ and Mg2+-dependent endonuclease DNAS1L3 in the induction of such death process. This was achieved with the use of MCF-7 cells, a caspase-3-deficient breast adenocarcinoma cell line, thymocytes isolated from DFF45 (the inhibitory and chaperone subunit of the DNA fragmentation factor subunit, DFF40) deficient mice, and HeLa cells, a DNAS1L3-deficient cervical carcinoma cell line. MCF-7 exhibited a marked resistance to acetaminophen treatment. Ectopic expression of human caspase-3 significantly potentiated the cytotoxic effect of acetaminophen and promoted the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol of treated cells suggesting a direct role for caspase-3 in acetaminophen-induced apoptosis. Expression and cleavage of DFF45 were required but not sufficient for acetaminophen-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. DFF45 gene knockout rendered thymocytes resistant against acetaminophen-induced generation of both large and internucleosomal DNA fragments. The treatment of HeLa cells with acetaminophen resulted in internuclesomal DNA fragmentation only after transfection of these cells with a plasmid encoding the DNAS1L3 gene suggesting that this endonuclease is required for acetaminophen-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. DNAS1L3 expression potentiated the cytotoxic effect of acetaminophen in HeLa cells suggesting an active role in the death process induced by this drug. Altogether, these results demonstrate the specific roles of caspase-3, DNA fragmentation factor, and DNAS1L3 in the process of acetaminophen-induced apoptosis in cultured cells.
Extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptics are important in clinical practice. Study of extra-pyramidal side effects is also of importance for researchers who test new antipsychotic agents or study tardive dyskinesia. A french translation of the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale of extra-pyramidal side effects thus appeared useful. This scale contains 10 items: Gait, Arm dropping, Shoulder shaking. Elbow rigidity, Wrist rigidity, Leg pendulousness, Head dropping, Glabella Tap, Tremor, Salivation. Each item is rated between 0 and 4. A total score is obtained by adding the items and dividing by 10. Scores of up to 0.3 are considered within the normal range. The scale original has been validated in a population of fourteen psychotic inpatients taking, in a double-blind procedure, placebo, haloperidol 6 mg/day or haloperidol 30 mg/day. Patients receiving haloperidol 30 mg/day presented more extrapyramidal symptoms than patients under placebo. The Simpson Angus rating scale has also been shown to have clinical validity and high inter-rater reliability. It can be routinely used in clinical drug evaluation. The french version was used in a population of 30 psychotic inpatients fulfilling the DSM III-R criteria of schizophrenic disorder. Patients were treated for at least two weeks, orally, either with a phenothiazine (chlorpromazine 350 mg) or a butyrophenone (haloperidol 15 mg). 10 of the 30 patients received, in addition, anticholinergic agents (trihexiphenidyl, 5 mg). The french version of The Simpson Angus Rating Scale appeared to be easy to use and not time-consuming. Interraters correlation was high. Patients receiving butyrophenones or phenothiazines had no significantly different ages and sociodemographic characteristics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Three children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) developed delayed-onset transient hemiparesis and facial palsy after intrathecal (IT) administration of methotrexate (MTX) alone or as part of triple intrathecal chemotherapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. The hemiparesis developed 10 to 14 days after IT therapy. Two of three children also experienced transient, profound expressive dysarthria. These episodes occurred during maintenance treatment after multiple IT administrations and without previous CNS toxicity. Two of three children received intermediate-dose MTX, 1 g/m2, not less than 5 weeks before events. These patients had not received cranial irradiation and had no evidence of CNS leukemia before or after these episodes. Ischemic changes on computerized tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging studies were documented in all three cases. Such changes are unusual manifestations of neurotoxicity in children after intrathecal therapy.
Alterations in the TP53 and MDM2 genes appear to be important in the development of many human tumors, but evidence is conflicting on associations between polymorphisms in these genes and risk of prostate cancer (PCa). The influence of TP53 codon 72, MDM2 SNP309, and MDM2 C1797G polymorphisms in southern Chinese PCa patients was investigated. In the comparison of genotype distributions of TP53 codon 72 between cases and controls, the adjusted odds ratios for PCa associated with the Pro/Pro, Arg/Pro, and Arg/Arg genotypes were 1.00, 1.89 (95% CI = 1.20-2.97), and 2.01 (95% CI = 1.11-3.64), respectively; however, MDM2 SNP309 and C1797G did not show any significant difference between cases and controls. When TP53 and MDM2 polymorphisms were combined based on the numbers of variant risk alleles (i.e., G-allele of TP53 codon 72, G-allele of MDM2 SNP309, and G-allele of MDM2 C1797G), individuals with 3-5 variants had a 1.56-fold greater risk of PCa than those with 0-2 variants (95% CI = 1.07-2.26). Moreover, subjects with 0-2 variants had 33.3% positive p53 expression, whereas subjects with 3-5 variants had 23.3% p53 expression (P = 0.39). These findings suggest that TP53 and MDM2 polymorphisms play a role in PCa susceptibility in southern Chinese Han population.
The present study sought to understand the mechanisms of attenuation of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) by resveratrol (RES). SAP was experimentally induced in rats by injection of 4% sodium taurocholate in the retrograde pancreatic duct. Three study groups were evaluated: Group I (sham-operated animals), Group II (SAP animals), and Group III (SAP animals treated with RES at 20 mg/kg/body weight, 5 min after induction of SAP). The study outcomes were histopathologic changes and alterations in biochemical markers: plasma renin activity and levels of angiotensin II, endothelin, and nitric oxide in plasma. Biochemical markers were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 h after induction of SAP. SAP was associated with significant (p < 0.05) histopathologic changes (saponification spots in the intraperitoneal cavity, severe pancreatic edema, blood congestion, varying degrees of necrosis, etc.), as well as with elevation of biochemical markers in blood plasma. RES treatment significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated changes of both histopathologic and biochemical markers induced by SAP. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that RES treatment is a promising therapeutic approach to suppress microcirculatory disturbance in SAP.
This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that Tongxinluo (TXL) as a Chinese herbal medicine enhances stability of vulnerable plaque dose dependently via lipid-lowering and anti-inflammation effects, similar to a high-dose simvastatin therapy. After abdominal aortic balloon injury, 75 rabbits were fed a 1% cholesterol diet for 10 wk and were then divided into five groups for 8-wk treatment: control group, low-dose TXL group, moderate-dose TXL group, high-dose TXL group, and high-dose simvastatin group. At the end of week 16, an adenovirus containing p53 was injected into the abdominal aortic plaques. Two weeks later, plaque rupture was induced by pharmacological triggering. The incidence of plaque rupture in all treatment groups (14.3%, 7.1%, 7.7%, and 7.1%) was significantly lower than that in control group (73.3%; P>0.01). TXL dose-dependently lowered serum lipid levels and inhibited systemic inflammation. Corrected acoustic intensity and fibrous cap thickness of the aortic plaques were significantly increased, whereas plaque area, plaque burden, vulnerable index, and expression of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) receptor 1, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, tissue inhibitor of MMP 1, and NF-kappaB in plaques were markedly reduced in all treatment groups when compared with the control group. Similar to high-dose simvastatin group, high-dose TXL group exhibited a low serum level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and ox-LDL, a low expression level of systemic and local inflammatory factors and a low plaque vulnerability index, with no differences in the incidence of plaque rupture among all treatment groups. TXL dose-dependently enhances the stability of vulnerable plaques and prevents plaques from rupture. Simvastatin and TXL offer similar protection in terms of lipid-lowering, anti-inflammation, and antioxidation effects.
The effects of epinastine hydrochloride and terfenadine on electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters in rats were investigated from a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic perspective. Epinastine hydrochloride (1 or 3 mg kg-1 h-1) or terfenadine (5, 10 or 15 mg kg-1 h-1) was intravenously infused into rats anaesthetized with urethane and alpha-chloralose. The changes in the QT interval derived from limb lead II and the chest lead, heart rate and PR interval were analysed. The time-course of the plasma drug-concentration of each drug was also investigated. Terfenadine prolonged the QT interval in an infusion-rate-dependent manner, its EC50 value was 792-1039 ng mL-1. An obvious QT prolongation was, moreover, observed even at a plasma terfenadine concentration of 100-200 ng mL-1, which is clinically quite high, but might be achieved under a definite condition such as a restrained terfenadine metabolism. Terfenadine also induced PR prolongation and bradycardia in an infusion-rate dependent manner. Epinastine slightly increased the heart rate, but did not affect any of the other ECG parameters even at a plasma concentration of 400 ng mL-1, which is more than 10 times the maximum concentration attained after an ordinary dosage regimen in man. We conclude that epinastine might have an advantage over terfenadine in avoiding adverse electrocardiographic reactions.
Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of doxorubicin (Dox)-induced heart failure. NRG1, however, activates the erbB2 receptor, which is frequently overexpressed in breast cancers. It is, therefore, important to understand how NRG1, via erbB2, protects the heart against Dox cardiotoxicity. Here, we studied NRG1-erbB2 signaling in Dox-treated mice hearts and in isolated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM). Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with recombinant NRG1 before and daily after a single dose of Dox. Cardiac function was determined by catheterization. Two-week survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cardiac troponins [cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT)] and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were determined in mice hearts and in NRVM by Western blot analysis. Activation of caspases and ubiquitinylation of troponins were determined in NRVM by caspase assay and immunoprecipitation. NRG1 significantly improved survival and cardiac function in Dox-treated mice. NRG1 reduced the decrease in cTnI, cTnT, and cardiac troponin C (cTnC) and maintained Akt phosphorylation in Dox-treated mice hearts. NRG1 reduced the decrease in cTnI and cTnT mRNA and proteins in Dox-treated NRVM. Inhibition of erbB2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mTOR blocked the protective effects of NRG1 on cTnI and cTnT in NRVM. NRG1 significantly reduced Dox-induced caspase activation, which degraded troponins, in NRVM. NRG1 reduced Dox-induced proteasome degradation of cTnI. NRG1 attenuates Dox-induced decrease in cardiac troponins by increasing transcription and translation and by inhibiting caspase activation and proteasome degradation of troponin proteins. NRG1 maintains cardiac troponins by the erbB2-PI3K pathway, which may lessen Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently experienced painful sensations that could be in part due to central modification of nociception. We compared pain threshold before and after administration of levodopa in PD patients and in controls, and investigated cerebral activity with positron emission tomography (PET) during experimental nociceptive stimulation. Pain threshold was determined using thermal stimulation during two randomized conditions: off and on. We performed H(2) (15)O PET analysis of regional cerebral blood flow on subjects while they received alternate randomized noxious and innocuous stimuli during off and on conditions. In off condition, pain threshold in nine PD patients was significantly lower than in nine controls. Administration of levodopa significantly raised pain threshold in PD patients but not in controls. During off condition, there was a significant increase in pain-induced activation in right insula and prefrontal and left anterior cingulate cortices in PD compared to control group. Levodopa significantly reduced pain-induced activation in these areas in PD. This study shows that pain threshold is lower in PD patients but returns to normal ranges after levodopa administration. Moreover, PD patients have higher pain-induced activation in nociceptive pathways, which can be reduced by levodopa.
Bupivacaine affects the vascular resistance by peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms. As vasoconstrictors increase the CNS toxicity of IV bupivacaine, vasodilators may decrease its CNS toxicity. We examined the hypothesis that vasodilators decrease the CNS toxicity of bupivacaine in awake, spontaneously breathing rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (C), nicardipine (N), and phentolamine (P) groups (n = 12 in each group). Racemic bupivacaine was administered IV at 1 mg/kg/min until tonic/clonic convulsions occurred. Saline, nicardipine (0.4 microg/min), and phentolamine (10 microg/min within 5 min, 50 microg/min thereafter) were simultaneously administered with bupivacaine in groups C, N, and P, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly increased by infusion of bupivacaine in group C and was maintained at baseline levels before the onset of convulsions in groups N and P. The convulsive dose of bupivacaine in group C was 5.8 +/- 1.5 mg/kg, but was significantly larger in groups N and P (7.6 +/- 1.5 and 8.1 +/- 1.1 mg/kg, P = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively). However, there were no differences in total or protein-unbound plasma concentration of bupivacaine or in concentration of bupivacaine in the brain at the onset of convulsions among the 3 groups. We conclude that nicardipine and phentolamine increase the cumulative dose but do not affect the threshold plasma or brain concentrations required for bupivacaine-induced convulsions.
Bupivacaine, a long-acting local anesthetic, induces central nervous system toxicity when its plasma concentration is increased. Nicardipine and phentolamine increased the cumulative dose but did not affect the threshold plasma concentrations, required for bupivacaine-induced convulsions, suggesting that both nicardipine and phentolamine inhibited the increase in the plasma concentration of bupivacaine by inducing peripheral vasodilation.
Si/SiO2 quantum dots (QDs) are novel particles with unique physicochemical properties that promote them as potential candidates for biomedical applications. Although their interaction with human cells has been poorly investigated, oxidative stress appears to be the main factor involved in the cytotoxicity of these nanoparticles. In this study, we show for the first time the influence of Si/SiO2 QDs on cellular redox homeostasis and glutathione distribution in human lung fibroblasts. The nanoparticles morphology, composition and structure have been investigated using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. MRC-5 cells (human lung fibroblasts) were incubated with various concentrations of Si/SiO2 QDs ranging between 25 and 200 μg/mL for up to 72 h. The results of the MTT and sulforhodamine B assays showed that exposure to QDs led to a time-dependent decrease in cell viability and biomass. The increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels together with the lower glutathione content suggested that the cellular redox homeostasis was altered. Regarding GSH distribution, the first two days of treatment resulted in a localization of GSH mainly in the cytoplasm, while at longer incubation time the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio indicated a nuclear localization. These modifications of cell redox state also affected the redox status of proteins, which was demonstrated by the accumulation of oxidized proteins and actin S-glutathionylation. In addition, the externalization of phosphatidylserine provided evidence that apoptosis might be responsible for cell death, but necrosis was also revealed. Our results suggest that Si/SiO2 quantum dots exerted cytotoxicity on MRC-5 cells by disturbing cellular homeostasis which had an effect upon protein redox status.
The antihypertensive activity of eighteen 'oxazolo[3,2-a]pyridine, thiazolo[3,2-a]pyridine and pyrido[2,1-b]oxazine derivatives has been evaluated in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and compared with that of nifedipine, used as reference. At a dose of 50 mg kg-1 (i.p.) eleven compounds resulted in a significant reduction in mean arterial blood pressure; four of the eleven were particularly effective, resulting in significant hypotension more than 6 h after administration and an effect that was still apparent after 24 h. The hypotension induced by nifedipine gradually decreased, disappearing 6-8 h after administration. The long-lasting activity shown by these compounds is, in general, not accompanied by reflex tachycardia. Intraperitoneal administration of two oxazolo[3,2-a]pyridine derivatives and two pyrido[2,1-b]oxazine derivatives resulted in potent and long-lasting antihypertensive action in SHRs. Further studies on the mechanism of action of these derivatives might help the determination of better structure-activity correlations and the design, synthesis and evaluation of better antihypertensive agents.
Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an X linked disorder and the most common inherited cause of hyperammonaemia. Fluctuating concentrations of ammonia, glutamine, and other excitotoxic amino acids result in a chronic or episodically recurring encephalopathy. A heterozygous female patient first presented with protein intolerance, attacks of vomiting, and signs of mental retardation in early childhood. At the age of 16 complex partial seizures occurred which were treated with sodium valproate. Seven days after initiation of valproate therapy, she developed severe hyperammonaemic encephalopathy with deep somnolence. The maximum concentration of ammonia was 480 micromol/l. After withdrawal of valproate, three cycles of plasma dialysis, and initiation of a specific therapy for the inborn metabolic disease, ammonia concentrations fell to normal values. The patient remitted, returning to her premorbid state. Valproate can cause high concentrations of ammonia in serum in patients with normal urea cycle enzymes and may worsen a pre-existing hyperammonaemia caused by an enzymatic defect of the urea cycle. Sufficient diagnostic tests for the detection of metabolic disorders must be performed before prescribing valproate for patients with a history of encephalopathy.
