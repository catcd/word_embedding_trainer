Asthma is an inflammatory disorder caused by airway exposures to allergens and chemical irritants. Studies focusing on immune, smooth muscle, and airway epithelial function revealed many aspects of the disease mechanism of asthma. However, the limited efficacies of immune-directed therapies suggest the involvement of additional mechanisms in asthmatic airway inflammation. TRPA1 is an irritant-sensing ion channel expressed in airway chemosensory nerves. TRPA1-activating stimuli such as cigarette smoke, chlorine, aldehydes, and scents are among the most prevalent triggers of asthma. Endogenous TRPA1 agonists, including reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation products, are potent drivers of allergen-induced airway inflammation in asthma. Here, we examined the role of TRPA1 in allergic asthma in the murine ovalbumin model. Strikingly, genetic ablation of TRPA1 inhibited allergen-induced leukocyte infiltration in the airways, reduced cytokine and mucus production, and almost completely abolished airway hyperreactivity to contractile stimuli. This phenotype is recapitulated by treatment of wild-type mice with HC-030031, a TRPA1 antagonist. HC-030031, when administered during airway allergen challenge, inhibited eosinophil infiltration and prevented the development of airway hyperreactivity. Trpa1(-/-) mice displayed deficiencies in chemically and allergen-induced neuropeptide release in the airways, providing a potential explanation for the impaired inflammatory response. Our data suggest that TRPA1 is a key integrator of interactions between the immune and nervous systems in the airways, driving asthmatic airway inflammation following inhaled allergen challenge. TRPA1 may represent a promising pharmacological target for the treatment of asthma and other allergic inflammatory conditions.
Torsade de pointes is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that is associated with prolongation of the QT interval. Although torsade de pointes is found in many clinical settings, it is mostly drug induced. Similar problems have been described with nonsedating H1-receptor antagonists, such as astemizole and terfenadine. Terfenadine is a widely used antihistamine. The authors report a case of torsade de pointes in a patient with a possible congenital sporadic form of QT interval prolongation who was receiving a therapeutic dose of terfenadine.
Natural compounds containing vanilloid and Michael acceptor moieties appear to possess anti-cancer and chemopreventive properties. The ginger constituent shogaol represents one such compound. In this study, the anti-cancer potential of a synthetic novel shogaol analog 3-phenyl-3-shogaol (3-Ph-3-SG) was assessed by evaluating its effects on signaling pathways. At non-toxic concentrations, 3-Ph-3-SG suppressed cancer cell invasion in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells through inhibition of PMA-activated MMP-9 expression. At similar concentrations, 3-Ph-3-SG reduced expression of the inflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostanglandin-E2 (PGE2) in RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells. Inhibition of cancer cell invasion and inflammation by 3-Ph-3-SG were mediated through suppression of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway. The 3-Ph-3-SG also demonstrated cytoprotective effects by inducing the antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven genes NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Cytoprotection by 3-Ph-3-SG was achieved at least partly through modification of cysteine residues in the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which resulted in accumulation of transcription factor NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The activities of 3-Ph-3-SG were comparable to those of 6-shogaol, the most abundant naturally-occurring shogaol, and stronger than those of 4-hydroxyl-null deshydroxy-3-phenyl-3-shogaol, which attested the importance of the 4-hydroxy substituent in the vanilloid moiety for bioactivity. In summary, 3-Ph-3-SG is shown to possess activities that modulate stress-associated pathways relevant to multiple steps in carcinogenesis. Therefore, it warrants further investigation of this compound as a promising candidate for use in chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive strategies.
Ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin are recognized immunomodulators. Their effects in acute lung injuries have not been tested. This study compared the immunoprotective effects of these agents in mice with lung injuries induced by LPS by measuring the cytokine profiles in the injured lung and the associated mortality.
The development of lung injury and mortality was compared in mice pretreated with either ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin or saline (control group) after the intratracheal administration of LPS. BALF and serum were collected at 1, 3 and 6 h to measure the concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10 and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) using enzyme-linked immunoassay.
Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and MIP-2 in the BAL of the ciprofloxacin group were significantly lower compared with those of controls (all P < 0.0083) at 3 and 6 h after LPS challenge. There were no significant differences in the levels of these cytokines in the moxifloxacin and levofloxacin groups compared with controls. Overall, the 96-h survival for the mice pretreated with ciprofloxacin, but not for those pretreated with moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, was significantly greater than that of the control animals (P = 0.019).
In the setting of LPS-induced lung injuries, ciprofloxacin appears to provide better anti-inflammatory properties and survival benefits than the other fluoroquinolones tested.
The authors have observed 4 cases of benign liver tumors associated with oral contraception. These lesions have been revealed by pains or abdominal tumors, and have been treated by surgery, or not treated. The relations between tumors livers and pill are studied. These tumors are probably frequent and can give acute complications such hemorrhage and perhaps cancer.
To examine the effect of a 14-membered ring macrolide on airway mucus hypersecretion in rats treated with LPS.
Mucus hypersecretion in rat airways was induced by intratracheal instillation of LPS. Rats treated with or without LPS were administered roxithromycin (1-10 mg/kg), josamycin (10 mg/kg) or amoxicillin (40 mg/kg), orally for 4 days. Expression of Muc5ac, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 and ERK1/2 in bronchial epithelium were detected by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry or western blotting. Mucins, IL-1beta, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in BAL fluid were assayed by enzyme-linked lectin assay and ELISA.
LPS significantly induced the expression of Muc5ac mRNA and protein in bronchial epithelium, increased the release of mucins, IL-1beta, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, and increased neutrophil numbers in BAL. Moreover, LPS increased staining for NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm as well as nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in airway epithelial cells. Upregulated expression of Muc5ac mRNA correlated positively with NF-kappaB activation and the levels of cytokines (P < 0.05). Roxithromycin (5 and 10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated bronchial Muc5ac expression and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation stimulated by LPS, and reduced neutrophil numbers, mucins and inflammatory cytokines in BAL (P < 0.05). However, LPS-stimulated expression of p38 and ERK1/2 in airway epithelium was not affected by roxithromycin. Josamycin and amoxicillin had no effects on Muc5ac expression, NF-kappaB activation or cytokine release.
Roxithromycin inhibits the pulmonary inflammatory response and airway mucus hypersecretion induced by LPS. The inhibitory effect of roxithromycin on airway mucus hypersecretion may be mediated through reduction of NF-kappaB activation, neutrophil infiltration and release of inflammatory cytokines in the lung.
To describe a patient with cocaine-induced panhypopituitarism associated with human neutrophil elastase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (HNE-ANCA).
A 41-year-old man presented with extreme fatigue, cold intolerance and anorexia with 20 kg weight loss in the last 6 months. His medical history was unremarkable. He snorted cocaine twice a week during the last 6 years. On examination, we saw a pale and skinny man, with a normal blood pressure. Because of the severity of symptoms central hypothyroidism was suspected and very low values of TSH, free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine were measured. His FSH, LH, ACTH, cortisol, prolactin and testosterone levels were also low. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan showed a normal-sized pituitary gland entirely embedded in a dense, oedematous, contrast-enhancing mass, and a total destruction of the nasal septum with the absence of conchae and severely impaired sinus walls. A transnasal biopsy showed an acute necrotising, non-specific and non-granulomatous inflammation. Although cocaine-induced panhypopituitarism was suspected, Wegener's granulomatosis could not be excluded. Serology on ANCA showed a strongly positive C-ANCA titre (320 U/l) with specificity for HNE. A cocaine-induced HNE-ANCA-associated panhypopituitarism was diagnosed. Our patient was advised to quit using cocaine immediately and was initially treated with glucocorticoids and testosterone, followed by thyroxine. This led to a dramatic clinical response with an increase of appetite, weight gain and regained energy. After 2 years, the patient is well and his ANCA titre is no longer positive.
We describe the first documented case of cocaine-induced panhypopituitarism associated with HNE-specific ANCA.
Both developmental and adult-stage hypothyroidism disrupt rat hippocampal neurogenesis. We previously showed that exposing mouse offspring to manganese permanently disrupts hippocampal neurogenesis and abolishes the asymmetric distribution of cells expressing Mid1, a molecule regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. The present study examined the involvement of Shh signaling on the disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis in rats with hypothyroidism. Pregnant rats were treated with methimazole (MMI) at 0 or 200 ppm in the drinking water from gestation day 10-21 days after delivery (developmental hypothyroidism). Adult male rats were treated with MMI in the same manner from postnatal day (PND) 46 to PND 77 (adult-stage hypothyroidism). Developmental hypothyroidism reduced the number of Mid1(+) cells within the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of offspring on PND 21, and consequently abolished the normal asymmetric predominance of Mid1(+) cells on the right side through the adult stage. In control animals, Shh was expressed in a subpopulation of hilar neurons, showing asymmetric distribution with left side predominance on PND 21; however, this asymmetry did not continue through the adult stage. Developmental hypothyroidism increased Shh(+) neurons bilaterally and abolished the asymmetric distribution pattern on PND 21. Adult hypothyroidism also disrupted the asymmetric distribution of Mid1(+) cells but did not affect the distribution of Shh(+) hilar neurons. The results suggest that the hippocampal neurogenesis disruption seen in hypothyroidism involves changes in asymmetric Shh(+) neuron distribution in developmental hypothyroidism and altered Mid1 expression in both developmental and adult-stage hypothyroidism.
The Australian adverse drug reaction reporting system is acknowledged as one of the best in the world. Despite its small population of less than 20 million people, Australia's current ADR reporting rate of over 12,000 reports per year places it in the top few nations in terms of reports per capita. The ADRAC program has been in operation for over 30 years. Australia was a founding member of the WHO International Drug Monitoring Programme which commenced in 1968 and currently there are about 153,000 reports in the ADRAC database. Reports from health professionals have uncovered a number of significant safety problems over the years. Of particular importance are flucloxacillin-induced hepatitis, amoxycillin/clavulanate-induced hepatitis, and the association of cystitis with tiaprofenic acid. The number and quality of the reports has allowed an understanding of the characteristics of the reactions and, using ADRAC reporters as a major source of cases, case-control studies have been completed which have identified risk factors. ADRAC's review of Australian reports has highlighted many important associations that have been disseminated through the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Bulletin.
The goal of this study was to determine the role of an influx copper transporter, CTR1, in the ototoxicity induced by cisplatin, a potent anticancer platinum analog used in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors. As determined through reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry, mouse CTR1 (Ctr1) was found to be abundantly expressed and highly localized at the primary sites of cisplatin toxicity in the inner ear, mainly outer hair cells (OHCs), inner hair cells, stria vascularis, spiral ganglia, and surrounding nerves in the mouse cochlea. A CTR1 substrate, copper sulfate, decreased the uptake and cytotoxicity of cisplatin in HEI-OC1, a cell line that expresses many molecular markers reminiscent of OHCs. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Ctr1 in this cell line caused a corresponding decrease in cisplatin uptake. In mice, intratympanic administration of copper sulfate 30 min before intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin was found to prevent hearing loss at click stimulus and 8, 16, and 32 kHz frequencies. To date, the utility of cisplatin remains severely limited because of its ototoxic effects. The studies described in this report suggest that cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and cochlear uptake can be modulated by administration of a CTR1 inhibitor, copper sulfate. The possibility of local administration of CTR1 inhibitors during cisplatin therapy as a means of otoprotection is thereby raised.
Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is usually seen in older adults and is often associated with systemic vascular disease, this is much less evident in young people. A case report of a 28-year-old woman presented a central retinal vein occlusion in her left eye. This young woman was treated with antiandrogenic drug. Investigations revealed an abnormality of the hemostatic system. The central retinal vein occlusion was resolved and the fundus assumed a normal appearance one-month after the primary episode. Retinal vascular occlusions with antiandrogenic drug may be due to three mechanisms: increased platelet cell aggregation, alteration of fibrinolytic system and vascular endothelium hyperplasia.
Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was reported to stimulate respiration and abolish the respiratory depressant effect of morphine-like analgesics. Some TRH analogs which have a diminished hormonal activity may be of interest as potential non-specific opioid antagonists. The mechanism of this effect of TRH and its analogs is still unclear. Thus, in the present work the respiratory stimulant effect of TRH and its analog RGH 2202 was studied in the urethane-anesthetized vagotomized artificially-ventilated rats. The integrated diaphragmatic electromyogram was used to evaluate the effects of the drugs. TRH and RGH 2202 administered either i.v. or directly onto the dorsal medullary surface significantly increased the respiratory activity of the diaphragm. TRH and RGH 2202 also effectively antagonized the diaphragm activity depression caused by morphine. The latency, time course and activity of RGH 2202 turned out to be close to those of TRH. The possible involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the mechanism of action of TRH and RGH 2202 was also investigated. It was shown that the non-competitive NMDA antagonists ketamine and MK-801 and the competitive antagonist D-amino-5-phosphonovalerate after local or i.v. administration prevented or discontinued the diaphragm activity stimulation by TRH and RGH 2202. Moreover, they blocked the antagonistic action of TRH and RGH 2202 on the morphine-induced diaphragm activity depression. Thus, we conclude, that TRH and RGH 2202 cause similar stimulant effects on the respiratory activity of the diaphragm and effectively antagonize its depression by morphine. These effects are likely to be mediated by the NMDA receptors located in the central respiratory structures.
The constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) mediates responses to the nongenotoxic rodent liver tumor promoter phenobarbital (PB), including certain gene expression changes, hepatomegaly, and tumor formation. Aberrant DNA methylation represents epigenetic events that can play multiple roles in tumorigenesis. Previously, 146 unique PB-induced regions of altered DNA methylation (RAMs) were observed in liver tumor-susceptible CAR wild-type (WT) mice (in 23 weeks, precancerous tissue, and 32 weeks, tumor tissue), as compared to the resistant knockout (KO). We believe that at least some of these might be key for tumorigenesis. In the current study, cloning and annotation of a subset (82%) of the unique RAMs revealed 47 genes exhibiting altered methylation; 17 are already implicated in cancer or related processes and, thus, we have identified 30 "new" candidate genes that might be involved in carcinogenesis due to an epigenetic alteration. These may contribute to tumor development through their involvement in angiogenesis, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal cell transition, growth/survival, and invasion/migration/metastasis. We have also, previously, discerned unique PB-elicited RAMs in liver tumor-prone B6C3F1 mice, as compared to the relatively resistant C57BL/6 strain, at 2 or 4 weeks, and identified 51 genes exhibiting altered methylation. Importantly, 11 of these genes were identified from identical, unique RAMs discerned in both the sensitive B6C3F1 and CAR WT mice, thus representing an initial, potential candidate "fingerprint" which might serve as a biomarker for PB-induced tumorigenesis. These two studies reveal "new" genes whose epigenetic statuses changed uniquely in liver tumor-susceptible mice (B6C3F1 and CAR WT), as compared to their resistant counterparts (C57BL/6 and CAR KO, respectively), within a continuum of PB-induced tumorigenesis.
To determine the long term outcome of systemic anti-inflammatory fibrosis suppression in cases of threatened trabeculectomy bleb failure in open angle glaucoma.
This prospective non-comparative case series followed 77 eyes of 63 patients which showed signs of threatened early bleb failure and were treated with oral anti-inflammatory fibrosis suppression of prednisone, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and colchicine taken for a mean period of 6 weeks, in addition to standard postoperative topical treatment, for a mean follow up of 6 years.
Trabeculectomy with anti-inflammatory fibrosis suppression controlled the IOP at < or =21 mm Hg with a probability of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.81 to 1.0) at 8 years and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.56 to 1.1) at 12 years. There were no reported cases of endophthalmitis, hypotonous maculopathy, late bleb leak, or serious systemic side effects.
Anti-inflammatory fibrosis suppression provided good control of bleb fibrosis without risk of sight threatening complications in a patient group at high risk of bleb failure.
Propylthiouracil is widely used to treat patients with hyperthyroidism. However, propylthiouracil-induced hepatitis is an uncommon entity. The case of a 15-year-old boy treated with propylthiouracil for hyperthyroidism who developed a cholestatic acute hepatitis is reported. Viral, metabolic and autoimmune liver diseases were excluded and liver biopsy showed a pattern suggestive of drug-induced cholestatic hepatitis. After discontinuing the drug, there was a progressive resolution of symptoms and normalization of liver biochemical tests. Despite its rarity, patients receiving propylthiouracil are exposed to develop severe hepatotoxicity.
The incidence of side effects due to two dosage regimens of minocycline was examined over a 5-day period. A total of 60 normal women volunteers were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to either a group who took 100 mg of minocycline twice a day or a group who took 75 mg of minocycline twice a day for 5 days. Both groups were comparable from the standpoints of age, size, race, and the use of oral contraception, nicotine, and ethanol. They were seen on a daily basis, and symptoms were evaluated by both volunteers (from diaries) and physicians. Minocycline serum concentrations were determined on blood samples taken 2 h after the a.m. dose. Volunteers taking 150 mg of minocycline per day had significantly lower serum antibiotic concentrations than those taking 200 mg per day. However, both low- and high-dose groups exhibited similar incidence and prevalence of recorded symptoms, with the single exception of nausea, where the low-dose group had fewer symptoms than the high-dose group (P = 0.035). Symptomatic volunteers did not have higher serum concentrations of minocycline than their asymptomatic counterparts. When either weight or surface area was examined with antibiotic serum concentration there was a significant inverse correlation between the two on day 2 for both groups and also on day 4 for the low-dose group. It is concluded that, in women, a dose of 150 mg of minocycline per day is associated with the same degree of side effects as a dose of 200 mg per day.
In this study, two selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), tamoxifen (TAM) and toremifene (TOR) or two estrogens, ethinylestradiol (EE) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) were administered to newborn male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (days 1-5) to investigate the occurrence of developmental abnormalities in the adulthood. The compounds were dosed (s.c.) at an equimolar dose of 24.9 micromol/kg. During the follow-up period, mortality occurred mainly in DES-treated male rats (3/4), associated with obstructive urinary calculi and suppurative renal inflammation in 2/3 rats. Similar lesions were not evident in other groups. At the age of 15 months, the animals were necropsied and organs were collected for histopathology and histomorphometry. Treatment-related abnormalities were restricted to the reproductive organs. Chronic prostatitis and epithelial abnormalities in the vas deferens were observed in all treatment groups. The columnar epithelium of vas deferens showed hyperplasia and development of subepithelial glandular structures resembling epididymal cysts reported in humans exposed in utero to DES. Testicular atrophy was observed especially in estrogen-treated rats. Mainly in SERM-treated female rats, the uterus showed luminal dilation or obstruction, loss of endometrial glands and myometrium disorganization including foci of muscular disruption. TOR-treated female rats showed polyp-like nodules (incidence 4/15) and a high incidence (9/15) of a simple cuboidal epithelium in cervical regions normally occupied by multilayered epithelia. In conclusion, the vas deferens is a main target organ following neonatal administration of SERMs and estrogens. In addition, female rats were significantly more susceptible to SERM treatment than to treatment with estrogens.
