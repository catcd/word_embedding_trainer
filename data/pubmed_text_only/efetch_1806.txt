Despite its complexity of action, doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiomyopathy eventually results in loss of cardiac myocytes which further contributes to the development of overt heart failure. In the present study, we examined the relevance of the apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) on cardiac myocyte survival and its underlying mechanisms in a model of Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Exposure of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes with Dox resulted in a downregulation of ARC mRNA and protein levels that occurred in a pre-translational and post-translational manner and led to a significant induction of apoptosis. Proteasomal inhibitors partially rescued both Dox-induced downregulation of ARC protein and induction of apoptosis. Knockdown of endogenous ARC sensitised cardiomyocytes to undergo apoptosis upon treatment with Dox. In contrast, enforced expression of ARC by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer dramatically increased the resistance of cardiomyocytes to undergo apoptotic cell death following Dox administration. In response to Dox, Bax translocated from cytosol to mitochondria where it resulted in dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and activation of caspases -3 and -9. ARC prevented Bax translocation to the mitochondrium and thereby blocked the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic death pathway in a t-Bid and caspase-8-independent manner. In this study, we provide evidence for the protective role of anti-apoptotic ARC in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity, which makes this molecule an interesting target for future therapies.
There have been reports of toxic reactions to ester-type local anesthetics in patients with genetic anomalies of plasma cholinesterase in so-called dibucaine-resistant homozygotes or heterozygotes. Because of these reports, 23 patients with prolonged apnea after administration of succinylcholine were studied with Kalow's method for abnormal dibucaine number (DN), which characterizes this condition, and for the history of local anesthetic toxicity. Thirty-eight relatives of abnormal individuals were studied in the same manner. Two atypical dibucaine-resistant homozygotes and the relative of one of these had toxic reactions to ester-type local anesthetics. Although low doses of ester-type local anesthetics may be tolerated by atypical homozygotes, these agents are best avoided and amide-type local anesthetics or tetracaine, which is hydrolyzed at a normal rate, should be used. Individuals with atypical plasma cholinesterase should wear a Medic-Alert bracelet or amulet so that complications and fatalities can be avoided.
To verify whether the decreasing neural tube defects birth prevalence rates in Chile are due to folic acid fortification or to pre-existing decreasing trends, we performed a population survey using a network of Estudio Colaborativo Latino Americano de Malformaciones Congenitas (ECLAMC, Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations) maternity hospitals in Chile, between the years 1982 and 2002. Within each maternity hospital, birth prevalence rates of spina bifida and anencephaly were calculated from two pre-fortification periods (1982-1989 and 1990-2000), and from one fortified period (2001-2002). There was no historical trend for spina bifida birth prevalence rates before folic acid fortification, and there was a 51% (minimum 27%, maximum 66%) decrease in the birth prevalence rates of this anomaly in the fortified period. The relative risks of spina bifida were homogeneous among hospitals in the two period comparisons. There was no historical trend for the birth prevalence of anencephaly comparing the two pre-fortified periods, but the relative risks were heterogeneous among hospitals in this comparison. There was a 42% (minimum 10%, maximum 63%) decrease in the birth prevalence rate of anencephaly in the fortified period as compared with the immediately pre-fortified period, with homogeneous relative risks among hospitals. Within the methodological constraints of this study we conclude that the birth prevalence rates for both spina bifida and anencephaly decreased as a result of folic acid fortification, without interference of decreasing secular trends.
Cyclosporin A (CsA; 50 mg/kg) and Fujimycine (FK506; 5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days. The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated. Cyclophilin A and FK506-binding protein, the main intracytoplasmic receptors for CsA and FK506, respectively, were each detected in renal tissue extract. In the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506, but not by rapamycin. Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not rapamycin. These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is an uncommon entity related to multiple and different pathologies, the most common being hypertensive crisis. It is believed to be secondary to the breakdown on the blood-brain barrier. At the beginning, it is undistinguishable from other leukoencephalopathies. However, the disappearance of brain lesions after removal of the potential cause, establish the differential diagnosis with other leukoencephalopathies. We present the case of an HIV-infected patient with a RPLS related to a hypertensive crisis short after the initiation of indinavir-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy. Once blood pressure was controlled and indinavir replaced by nelfinavir, white matter lesions at magnetic resonance imaging disappeared. The clinical and radiologic evolution excludes other diagnosis as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and points indinavir as a potential hypertension-inducing agent in HIV-infected predisposed subjects.
All available 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been implicated in causing rhabdomyolysis either as monotherapy or in combination with other myotoxic drugs such as cyclosporine, colchicine and fibrates. Cerivastatin (Baycol) is a third generation statin, which has been implicated in cases of fatal rhabdomyolysis. It was voluntary withdrawn from the U.S. market by Bayer after reports of fatal rhabdomyolysis appeared in the literature. We present here a case of an 85-year-old woman who developed rhabdomyolysis and severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) symptoms after having been started on cerivastatin therapy for hypercholesteremia.
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition exerts positive effects on the microvasculature of normotensive animals, although this concept is not universally accepted. Recently, ACE inhibitors have been suggested to be useful for rescue in peripheral ischemia.
We investigated whether chronic treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramipril may have a positive impact on the defective healing response to ischemia that is typical of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Unilateral limb ischemia was induced in 20-week-old SHR by surgically removing the left femoral artery. Rats were allowed to regain consciousness and then were randomly allocated to treatment with ramipril (1 mg/kg body weight in drinking water) or vehicle for 28 days.
The SHR failed to develop reparative angiogenesis in response to ischemia, thus having inadequate perfusion recovery. Ramipril reduced both tail-cuff systolic blood pressure (180 +/- 7 v 207 +/- 2 mm Hg in the vehicle group at 28 days, P < .05) and intra-arterial mean blood pressure (115 +/- 6 v 135 +/- 5 mm Hg in the vehicle group, P < .05). These effects were associated with increased responsiveness to endothelium-dependent vasodilatation by acetylcholine. Treatment with ramipril did not influence muscular capillary and arteriole density but accelerated the rate of perfusion recovery, leading to complete healing within 28 days after surgery.
These results indicate that ACE inhibition by ramipril may be useful for the treatment of peripheral vascular complications in hypertension.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common cause of sudden death in the young, is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by ventricular hypertrophy accompanied by myofibrillar disarrays. Linkage studies and candidate-gene approaches have demonstrated that about half of the patients have mutations in one of six disease genes: cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (c beta MHC), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), alpha-tropomyosin (alpha TM), cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMBPC), ventricular myosin essential light chain (vMLC1) and ventricular myosin regulatory light chain (vMLC2) genes. Other disease genes remain unknown. Because all the known disease genes encode major contractile elements in cardiac muscle, we have systematically characterized the cardiac sarcomere genes, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI), cardiac actin (cACT) and cardiac troponin C (cTnC) in 184 unrelated patients with HCM and found mutations in the cTnI gene in several patients. Family studies showed that an Arg145Gly mutation was linked to HCM and a Lys206Gln mutation had occurred de novo, thus strongly suggesting that cTnI is the seventh HCM gene.
Glutathione peroxidase is a selenium-containing, antioxidant enzyme previously implicated in the risk and development of lung and breast cancer, in part the result of allelic loss at the GPx-1 locus. This study examined allelic loss at the same locus in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. The frequency of a polymorphism at codon 198 resulting in either a leucine or a proline at that position was surveyed by comparing 133 DNA samples obtained from head and neck tumors and 517 samples obtained from cancer-free individuals. Tumor DNAs exhibited fewer pro/leu heterozygotes as compared to DNA obtained from the cancer-free population. Fewer GPx-1 heterozygotes were verified by determining the frequency of highly polymorphic alanine repeat sequences in the same gene. The analysis revealed an approximately 42% reduction in heterozygosity in the DNA from the tumor samples. In order to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the GPx-1 locus, DNA was genotyped from peripheral lymphocytes, tumor tissue, and microscopically normal tissues adjacent to the tumor, derived from the same patients. These studies indicated LOH at the GPx-1 locus in each of the three tumor/normal tissues sample sets examined. Furthermore, LOH in the microscopically normal tissues at the tumor margin occurred in two of the three sample sets examined. These data implicate GPx-1 in the development of squamous cell carcinoma the head and neck and suggest that allelic loss of this gene, or one tightly linked to it, is an early event in the development of this type of malignancy.
A tumor colony assay (TCA) was evaluated for its ability to predict anticancer drug responses in an N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide (FANFT)-induced murine bladder tumor (MBT) model. Ten anticancer drugs were evaluated in vivo and in vitro using four MBT cell lines (40 drug responses). Using the optimum criteria for drug response, the TCA accurately predicted drug responses in the murine model 65% of the time with a true-positive predictive rate of 54% and a true-negative predictive rate of 70%. Drug testing tumor cells immediately on removal from the mouse resulted in a true-positive predictive rate of 77% and a true-negative predictive rate of 100%. The authors conclude that the TCA can predict response to chemotherapy in the MBT model and may be useful in screening investigation compounds for the subsequent evaluation in this murine bladder tumor model.
The effect of intravenously administered procainamide (0.5-1 g, mean 0.966 g) on the inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia by programmed ventricular stimulation was tested in 15 patients (12 men and 3 women, mean age 57.2 +/- 16.6 years) with confirmed sustained ventricular tachycardia. Eleven patients had a previous myocardial infarction and two had congestive heart failure. The programmed ventricular stimulation (1-3 premature stimuli following after ventricular stimulation at a rate of 100/120 and 140/min. and a number of quick stimuli with a rising frequency from the apex of the right ventricle at an intensity equal to twice the diastolic threshold) was administered before and after procainamide administration. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was induced during the controlled examination in all 15 patients (100% sensitivity). Induced ventricular tachycardia had a haemodynamically important course with a rapid onset of unconsciousness in three patients whose index of risk of ventricular tachycardia (ratio of its frequency and the ejection fraction at rest) was significantly higher than in the remaining 12 patients (9.0 +/- 2.2 as compared with 4.9 +/- 1.2). Procainamide prevented the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in six patients (group I), i. e. in 40%. In the remaining nine patients (group II) ventricular tachycardia induced after procainamide had a significantly lower frequency (192 +/- 34/min.), as compared with controls (214 +/- 42/min.), but its haemodynamic impact was not affected. Patients of group I had, as compared with group II, a significantly higher ejection fraction (47 +/- 14% as compared with 35 +/- 10%) and a significantly lower index of the risk of tachycardia (4.5 +/- 1.3 as compared with 6.5 +/- 2.4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Unlike other tumors, melanomas harbor wild-type (WT) p53 but exhibit impaired p53-dependent apoptosis. The mechanisms for the impaired p53 activation are poorly understood but may be linked to the high expression of the p53 suppressor Mdm2, which is found in >50% of melanoma lesions. Here, we describe an organometallic glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) inhibitor (DW1/2) as a potent activator of p53 and inducer of cell death in otherwise highly chemoresistant melanoma cells. Using RNA interference and pharmacologic approaches, we show that p53 is required for the cytotoxic effects of this organometallic inhibitor. The DW1/2 compound was barely able to induce cell death in melanoma cells with p53 mutations, further confirming the requirement for p53-WT in the cytotoxic effects of the GSK3beta inhibition. Mechanistic analysis of the p53-dependent cell death indicated an apoptotic mechanism involving depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase cleavage, and elevated NOXA expression. The effect of p53 was not simply due to passive up-regulation of protein expression as adenoviral-mediated overexpression of p53 was not able to induce cell death. Treatment of melanoma cells with DW1/2 was instead found to decrease levels of Mdm2 and Mdm4. The importance of Mdm2 down-regulation in DW1/2-induced apoptosis was confirmed by treating the p53-WT cells with the p53/Mdm2 antagonist Nutlin-3. Taken together, our data provide a new strategy for the pharmacologic activation of p53 in melanoma, which may be a viable approach for overcoming apoptotic resistance in melanoma and offer new hope for rational melanoma therapy.
We investigated the global gene expression in a large panel of pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) aimed at identifying new potential targets for therapy and biomarkers to predict patient outcome.
Using a custom microarray, we analyzed 72 primary PETs, seven matched metastases, and 10 normal pancreatic samples. Relevant differentially expressed genes were validated by either quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays.
Our data showed that: tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were downregulated in most of the primary tumors, and their low expression was significantly associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival; somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) was absent or very low in insulinomas compared with nonfunctioning tumors; and expression of fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) gene was significantly associated with the occurrence of liver metastasis and shorter disease-free survival. TSC2 and PTEN are two key inhibitors of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the specific inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or RAD001 inhibited cell proliferation of PET cell lines.
Our results strongly support a role for PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in PET, which ties in with the fact that mTOR inhibitors have reached phase III trials in neuroendocrine tumors. The finding of differential SSTR expression raises the potential for SSTR expression to be evaluated as a marker of response to somatostatin analogs. Finally, we identified FGF13 as a new prognostic marker that predicted poorer outcome in patients who were clinically considered free from disease.
The authors found that fluoxetine significantly shortens at 5 microM/L and nearly normalizes at 10 microM/L the prolonged opening bursts of slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (SCCMS) acetylcholine receptors (AChR) expressed in fibroblasts. Prompted by this observation, they treated two SCCMS patients allergic to quinidine with up to 80 to 120 mg of fluoxetine per day over 3 years (serum fluoxetine + norfluoxetine levels 8 to 11 microM/L). Both patients showed marked subjective and objective improvement by quantitative muscle strength testing and electromyography.
The present study reports the effect of ceramide generated by hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) and of cell-permeable ceramide analogues on the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Incubation of the rat primary astrocytes with SMase led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in MnSOD activity. The increase in MnSOD activity was accompanied by an increase in MnSOD protein and mRNA. A similar effect on the expression of MnSOD was observed with the addition of cell-permeable ceramide analogues (C2 and C6). On the other hand, C2-dihydroceramide (N-acetylsphinganine), which lacks the functional critical double bond, was ineffective in inducing the expression of MnSOD. Nuclear run-on analysis showed that SMase and ceramide increased the rate of transcription of the MnSOD gene. Besides astrocytes, SMase was also found to induce the expression of MnSOD in rat mesangial cells, C6 glial cells, PC12 cells, and human skin fibroblasts. Markedly higher expression of mRNA, protein, and activity of MnSOD in skin fibroblasts from patients with Farber disease, a human disorder with pathognomonic accumulation of ceramide due to a deficiency of ceramidase, than in normal skin fibroblasts indicate that ceramide may act as a physiological inducer of MnSOD gene expression. However, stimulation of ceramide-mediated DNA fragmentation by antisense knockdown of MnSOD suggests that induction of MnSOD by ceramide is a protective response of the cell.
Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) is a secretory copper enzyme involved in protecting angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension. We found previously that Ang II upregulates SOD3 expression and activity as a counterregulatory mechanism; however, underlying mechanisms are unclear. Antioxidant 1 (Atox1) is shown to act as a copper-dependent transcription factor, as well as a copper chaperone, for SOD3 in vitro, but its role in Ang II-induced hypertension in vivo is unknown. Here we show that Ang II infusion increases Atox1 expression, as well as SOD3 expression and activity, in aortas of wild-type mice, which are inhibited in mice lacking Atox1. Accordingly, Ang II increases vascular superoxide production, reduces endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and increases vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries to a greater extent in Atox1(-/-) than in wild-type mice. This contributes to augmented hypertensive response to Ang II in Atox1(-/-) mice. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, Ang II promotes translocation of Atox1 to the nucleus, thereby increasing SOD3 transcription by binding to Atox1-responsive element in the SOD3 promoter. Furthermore, Ang II increases Atox1 binding to the copper exporter ATP7A, which obtains copper from Atox1, as well as translocation of ATP7A to plasma membranes, where it colocalizes with SOD3. As its consequence, Ang II decreases vascular copper levels, which is inhibited in Atox1(-/-) mice. In summary, Atox1 functions to prevent Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction and hypercontraction in resistant vessels, as well as hypertension, in vivo by reducing extracellular superoxide levels via increasing vascular SOD3 expression and activity.
Improving glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment with radio-chemotherapy remains a challenge. Topotecan is an attractive option as it exhibits growth inhibition of human glioma as well as brain penetration. The present study assessed the combination of radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions/40 days) and topotecan (0.9 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 on weeks 1, 3 and 5) in 50 adults with histologically proven and untreated GBM. The incidence of non-hematological toxicities was low and grade 3-4 hematological toxicities were reported in 20 patients (mainly lymphopenia and neutropenia). Partial response and stabilization rates were 2% and 32%, respectively, with an overall time to progression of 12 weeks. One-year overall survival (OS) rate was 42%, with a median OS of 40 weeks. Topotecan in combination with radiotherapy was well tolerated. However, while response and stabilization concerned one-third of the patients, the study did not show increased benefits in terms of survival in patients with unresectable GBM.
A link between endotoxemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been demonstrated in human and rodent animals. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of endotoxin-evoked NAFLD remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked hepatic lipid accumulation. Melatonin is an antioxidant. In the present study, we investigated the effects of melatonin on LPS-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. We showed that a single dose of LPS significantly increased hepatic triglyceride (TG) contents and caused hepatic lipid accumulation in mice. Further analysis found that hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c was activated in LPS-treated mice. In agreement with hepatic SREBP-1c activation, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), two SREBP-1c target genes, were significantly upregulated in liver of mice injected with LPS. Melatonin significantly attenuated LPS-induced SREBP-1c activation and the expression of SREBP-1c target genes. In addition, melatonin reduced serum and hepatic triglyceride (TG) content and prevented LPS-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Taken together, these results suggest that ROS might be, at least partially, mediated in LPS-induced SREBP-1c activation and hepatic lipid accumulation. Melatonin may be useful as pharmacological agents to protect against endotoxin-evoked NAFLD.
The cardiovascular effects of acute ethanol administration were studied in rats selectively bred for high (HAS) or low sensitivity (LAS) to the acute hypnotic effect of ethanol. In chronically cannulated, conscious animals, the intravenous administration of 1 g/kg of ethanol caused moderate hypotension and tachycardia in both HAS and LAS rats. The phenylephrine-induced reflex bradycardia and the baroreflex slope were significantly reduced by ethanol only in HAS and not in LAS rats. In urethane-anesthetized HAS rats, the baroreflex inhibitory action of ethanol was present under control conditions, but it was absent after depletion of endogenous GABA by treatment of the rats with 100 mg/kg of 3-mercaptopropionate. These findings confirm the role of endogenous GABA in the baroreflex inhibitory action of ethanol, and are compatible with the documented differential sensitivity of the GABAA, receptor complex to ethanol in HAS and LAS rats.
A number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported to provoke hepatic injury. Nimesulide is a new agent of the sulfonanilide class, and is a more selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase type 2 than of type 1. Well-documented cases of acute hepatitis have not yet been reported with this drug. We report on six patients who developed acute liver damage after initiation of nimesulide.
Between April 1996 and January 1997, six patients with apparent nimesulide-induced liver injury were admitted. Clinical, laboratory, serologic, radiological, and histologic data of all six cases were extensively analyzed. The causal relationship between nimesulide and liver injury was assessed, using a scoring system elaborated by the French and International consensus meeting group.
Four women developed a centrilobular (three) or panlobular (one) bridging necrosis, whereas two men showed a bland intrahepatic cholestasis. Jaundice was the presenting symptom in five of the six cases. One patient with hepatocellular necrosis and one with cholestasis had hallmarks of hypersensitivity with an increased blood and tissue eosinophilia. The causal relationship could be designated as "highly probable" in one, "probable" in four, and "possible" in one patient. One patient died from a pancreatic tumor 5 months after the diagnosis of toxic liver injury. In all other patients, liver tests returned to completely normal values within a late follow-up period of 6 to 17 months.
Nimesulide-induced liver injury can present with hepatocellular necrosis or with pure cholestasis. From clinical and histologic data, it appears that both immunologic and metabolic idiosyncratic reactions can be invoked as the pathogenic mechanisms of nimesulide-induced liver disease.
The dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3) is a candidate gene for Parkinson's disease (PD) on the basis of its critical role in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Previously, we identified 22 SNPs in the 5' region of SLC6A3, which segregate as eight haplotypes that differ in transcriptional activity when transfected in rat dopamine-producing cells. In the present work from a case-control study size of 293 cases and 395 controls, we employed a cladistic approach to examine gene-disease association. First, we found strong evidence of balancing selection in this region, as determined by a Tajima's D statistic of 2.97 (P<0.001). Second, we found that the eight haplotypes fit into two main clades and that diplotypes of these clades were marginally associated with PD. Then, after we classified cases and controls by the number of risk alleles, accounting for the well-known 3' region VNTR polymorphism, we found that having two or more risk alleles resulted in a modest but significant increase in PD risk [odds ratio=1.58; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-2.40]. Finally, we detected a significant interaction between occupational pesticide exposure in men and the number of risk alleles. Among pesticide-exposed subjects, the odds ratio for having two or more risk alleles was 5.66 (95% CI: 1.73-18.53). Thus, allelic variants in SLC6A3, which affect gene expression, are associated with PD in this population and may interact with occupational pesticide exposure to increase PD risk.
Doxapram, a respiratory stimulant, is used to treat idiopathic apnea of prematurity. The side effects reported are minimal. We present three cases of second-degree atrioventricular block caused by QT interval prolongation associated with doxapram administration. All three infants returned to normal sinus rhythm after doxapram administration was stopped.
Recent studies have indicated that the tamoxifen-related risk of uterine corpus cancer may be especially high for some uncommon cell types, although the magnitude of risk has not been quantified. We evaluated data from 39 451 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 1980 through 2000 who were initially treated with tamoxifen and found that the overall risk of subsequent uterine corpus cancer was increased more than twofold (observed-to-expected ratio [O/E] = 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.95 to 2.41) relative to the general SEER population. The relative risk was substantially higher for malignant mixed mullerian tumors (MMMTs) (O/E = 4.62, O = 34, 95% CI = 3.20 to 6.46) than for endometrial adenocarcinomas (O/E = 2.07, O = 306, 95% CI = 1.85 to 2.32), although the excess absolute risk was smaller-an additional 1.4 versus 8.4 cancers per 10 000 women per year, respectively. Among those who survived for 5 years or longer, there was an eightfold relative risk for MMMTs and a 2.3-fold risk for endometrial adenocarcinomas, with patients developing MMMTs having a worse prognosis. These findings indicate that tamoxifen may have delayed effects, such as the increased risk of MMMTs, rare but aggressive tumors of unclear pathogenesis.
Case report.
To report a case of HIV-related lipodystrophy with a rapid onset of symptoms from epidural lipomatosis in the wake of protease inhibitor and steroid treatment.
Symptomatic spinal epidural lipomatosis is considered to be a rare condition usually presenting with slowly progressive cord or nerve root compression. Only 2 cases of spinal lipomatosis in HIV-related lipodystrophy have been reported.
We describe the case of a 41-year-old male with HIV who received protease inhibitor medication and had neurologic deficits rapidly develop.
The patient had complete paraplegia develop within 12 hours from admission following a 1-day history of unsteady gait and a 3-day history of leg numbness. After diagnosis of epidural lipomatosis on magnetic resonance imaging, the patient underwent decompressive thoraco-laminectomy. He recovered well and was able to walk by postoperative day 4.
It is important to maintain an awareness for the possible association between HIV lipodystrophy and symptomatic epidural lipomatosis.
In a kindred with three hyperlipidemic subjects who had premature atherosclerosis and complete deficiency of hepatic lipase activity, we had previously identified a novel structural hepatic lipase gene variant. We now report the identification of three more hepatic lipase gene mutations in this family and demonstrate that compound heterozygosity for two hepatic lipase mutations (designated S267F and T383M) underlies hepatic lipase deficiency.
The use of the appetite suppressant agents aminorex and fenfluramine derivatives has been reported as a risk factor for the development of pulmonary hypertension. A 29-year-old female developed pulmonary hypertension suspected to be due to an amphetamine-like appetite suppressant agent, mazindol ((+/-)-5-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,5-dihydro-3H-imidazo [2,1-a] isoindol-5-ol). She was admitted to Sapporo Medical University Hospital with dyspnea due to severe pulmonary hypertension. Twelve months prior to admission, she had taken mazindol continuously for a period of 10 weeks. As yet, her pulmonary hypertension has not completely improved. This is the first reported case of mazindol-associated pulmonary hypertension, which developed after a long latent interval, and it suggests that mazindol is also a risk factor for the development of pulmonary hypertension, making long-term follow-up necessary for patients taking this anorectic agent.
