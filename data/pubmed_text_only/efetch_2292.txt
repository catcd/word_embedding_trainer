To determine the effects of zafirlukast on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in children.
Exercise challenges were done 4 hours after single oral doses of zafirlukast or placebo were administered in asthmatic children (6 to 14 years) treated with beta 2-agonists alone. Subjects randomized to treatment had a >/=20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ) after a screening challenge. In a randomized, double-blind, 3-way, crossover design, group 1 (n = 20) received placebo and 5 and 20 mg zafirlukast, and group 2 (n = 19) received placebo and 10 and 40 mg zafirlukast. Maximal percentage fall in FEV1, area under the curve, and time to recovery of FEV1 to within 5% of baseline after the challenge were compared with analysis of variance.
Mean values for maximal fall in FEV1 ranged from -8.7% +/- 1.7% to -11.1% +/- 1.9% after zafirlukast compared with -17.1% +/- 1.8% and -16.3% +/- 1.9% after placebo. Differences from placebo for fall in FEV1 and area under the curve were significant (P </=.05) after 5, 20, and 40 mg zafirlukast and approached significance (P </=.08) after 10 mg zafirlukast. After all zafirlukast doses, recovery times (means of 5 to 7 minutes) decreased significantly (P </=.05) and by approximately half compared with placebo (11 and 14 minutes). Safety assessments did not differ among treatments.
Four hours after dosing, zafirlukast attenuated exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in children.
Analysis of reported families which include two or more members with streptomycin-induced hearing loss reveals that the trait of high susceptibility of cochlea to streptomycin is transmitted primarily through females. This is not explained by ordinary Mendelian inheritance; rather it is best understood by extranuclear inheritance.
DL-028 (chemical name: 3-[[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]methyl]-2,3-dihydroimidaz o[1,2-c]quinazolin-5(6H)-one (27b)) is a synthetic alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist. The present study was undertaken to investigate the hemodynamic effects of chronic DL-028 administration, alone or in combination with octreotide, in rats with portal hypertension.
Portal hypertension was induced by partial portal-vein ligation. Portal-hypertensive rats were allocated to one of the four groups: vehicle group (saline, 0.5 ml/12 h), octreotide group (30 microg/kg/12 h), DL-028 group (0.4 mg/kg/12 h), and octreotide (30 mg/kg/l2 h) plus DL-028 (0.4 mg/kg/12 h) group, with eight rats in each group. DL-028 or saline was administered by gavage and octreotide by subcutaneous injection. Drugs were given immediately after ligation and for 8 consecutive days thereafter. Systemic and splanchnic hemodynamic variables were measured thereafter.
Portal-vein-ligated rats showed a typical hyperdynamic state as compared with sham-operated rats. The portal venous pressure, portal tributary blood flow, and cardiac index were significantly reduced by treatment with octreotide, DL-028, or octreotide plus DL-028 in portal-hypertensive rats. Hyperdynamic variables of systemic, renal, hepatocollateral, and portal territory vascular resistances and renal and hepatic arterial blood flow were ameliorated by treatment with octreotide or octreotide plus DL-028 in portal-hypertensive rats. Octreotide plus DL-028 treatment exerted better hemodynamic effects on the cardiac index but worse effects on systemic and hepatocollateral vascular resistance than octreotide treatment alone.
Although either DL-028 or octreotide ameliorated portal hypertension and splanchnic hyperemia in portal-hypertensive rats, octreotide treatment exerted more beneficial hemodynamic effects than DL-028 treatment. The combination of octreotide and DL-028 conferred no better hemodynamic benefits than octreotide alone, except on the cardiac index.
A 3-year-old White child was admitted to the critical care unit in a coma after a generalized convulsion. Codeine and salicylic acid were present in his plasma. The possible aetiology and management are discussed.
We evaluated the toxicity and efficacy of netilmicin and tobramycin in 89 older adults with serious bacterial infections and pre-existing renal impairment in a prospective, blinded, randomized trial. Complete resolution or improvement of infection occurred at 34/36 (94%) evaluable sites in netilmicin-treated patients and at 26/31 (84%) evaluable sites in tobramycin-treated patients. 10/44 (23%) netilmicin- and 7/45 (16%) tobramycin-treated patients experienced nephrotoxicity during treatment. The mean serum creatinine level improved significantly at the end of therapy compared to pre-treatment in those patients who did not experience nephrotoxicity in both treatment groups. 5/19 (26%) netilmicin-treated patients and 2/18 (11%) tobramycin-treated patients assessable for ototoxicity experienced decrements in auditory thresholds. Ototoxic netilmicin-treated patients had higher serum netilmicin levels than did non-ototoxic patients. Patients who experienced ototoxicity were not more likely to have experienced nephrotoxicity. The rates of toxicity were not statistically different and were similar to those seen in studies of patients with normal pre-treatment renal function.
In a number of different cancer including endometrial cancers, tumor suppressor phosphatase tensin homologue (PTEN, a lipid phosphatase) is frequently mutated. PTEN dephosphorylates PI 3-K product, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), into inactive PIP2 which blocks Akt activation/phosphorylation. In the present study, we have used an endometrial cancer cell line known to possess wild-type PTEN (HEC-1-A) and two mutated inactive PTEN protein cell lines (RL-95-2 and Ishikawa) to investigate importance of PI 3-K/PTEN/Akt survival pathway in endometrial cancers. As hypothesised, results showed high levels of Akt1/2 mRNAs and protein phosphorylation in the two mutated PTEN human endometrial cancer cells. To test the possible involvement of Akt in the regulation of survival factors, Bcl-2, XIAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 expression were measured. cIAP-1 protein expression was high in cells expressing phospho-Akt. XIAP and cIAP-2 protein expression was not influenced by the presence of active Akt. Akt phosphorylation decreased and apoptosis was strongly increased in mutated PTEN human endometrial cancer cells in the presence of PI 3-K inhibitor (Wortmannin) which was accompanied by a down-regulation of cIAP-1 protein. Wortmannin had no effect on wild-type PTEN HEC-1-A cell line. Although, Bcl-2 expression was strongly expressed in mutated-PTEN cells, expression remained stable in the presence of Wortmannin suggesting that Bcl-2 is not regulated by Akt. Overexpression of Akt using a constitutively active Akt expression vector resulted in an up-regulation of cIAP-1 expression. These results suggest a pivotal role of Akt in the regulation of endometrial cancer cell survival through the up-regulation of a specific inhibitor of apoptosis protein.
Antinociception and central nervous system depression (CNSD) caused by intraperitoneal, intrathecal and subcutaneous administration of oxycodone or morphine were studied in a randomized and blind, saline controlled study in rats. Antinociception was assessed with the tail-flick and hot plate tests. CNSD was assessed by testing the corneal, placing and righting reflexes and with a 4-point catalepsy score. Intraperitoneally and subcutaneously administered oxycodone and morphine were given in doses of 2.5-10 and 5-20 mg kg-1 respectively. The intrathecal doses were 12.5 micrograms and 100 micrograms of oxycodone and 6.25 micrograms and 50 micrograms of morphine. In both nociceptive tests subcutaneously and intraperitoneally administered oxycodone was 2-4 times more potent than morphine, while intrathecal morphine was over 14 times more potent. CNSD was more profound with oxycodone than with morphine after intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration, but was not observed after intratechal administration of either drug. Differences in opioid receptor affinities, liposolubilities and metabolism are discussed as possible explanations.
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that desipramine would be an effective treatment in cocaine abusers with current depressive disorders.
This was a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, 'placebo-controlled trial of outpatients (N = 111) meeting DSM-III-R criteria for cocaine dependence and major depression or dysthymia (by SCID interview). Participants were treated with desipramine, up to 300 mg per day, or matching placebo. All patients received weekly individual manual-guided relapse prevention therapy. Weekly outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impression Scale, self-reported cocaine use and craving, urine toxicology, and the Hamilton Depression Scale (biweekly). Summary measures of mood and cocaine use outcome were compared between treatment groups with chi2- or t-tests. Dichotomous summary measures of depression response and cocaine response were the primary outcomes. Mixed effect models were also fit to explore the relationship of cocaine use to mood improvement and treatment over weeks in the trial.
Desipramine was associated with a higher rate of depression response (51%, 28/55) than placebo (32%, 18/56) (p < 0.05), but treatment groups did not differ in rate of cocaine response. Depression improvement was associated with improvement in cocaine use. Desipramine was associated with more dropouts due to side effects and medical adverse events, while placebo was associated with more dropouts due to psychiatric worsening.
Desipramine was an effective treatment for depression among cocaine-dependent patients. Improvement in mood was associated with improvement in cocaine abuse, but a direct effect of medication on cocaine outcome was not clearly established and rates of sustained abstinence were low. Future research should examine newer antidepressant medications with more benign side effect profiles and combinations of behavioral and pharmacological treatments to maximize effects on cocaine use.
This study investigated whether integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics data increased the sensitivity of detection and provided new insight in the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Metabolite levels in plasma or urine were analyzed in relation to changes in hepatic gene expression in rats that received bromobenzene to induce acute hepatic centrilobular necrosis. Bromobenzene-induced lesions were only observed after treatment with the highest of 3 dose levels. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that metabolite profiles of blood plasma were largely different from controls when the rats were treated with bromobenzene, also at doses that did not elicit histopathological changes. Changes in levels of genes and metabolites were related to the degree of necrosis, providing putative novel markers of hepatotoxicity. Levels of endogenous metabolites like alanine, lactate, tyrosine and dimethylglycine differed in plasma from treated and control rats. The metabolite profiles of urine were found to be reflective of the exposure levels. This integrated analysis of hepatic transcriptomics and plasma metabolomics was able to more sensitively detect changes related to hepatotoxicity and discover novel markers. The relation between gene expression and metabolite levels was explored and additional insight in the role of various biological pathways in bromobenzene-induced hepatic necrosis was obtained, including the involvement of apoptosis and changes in glycolysis and amino acid metabolism.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder of childhood, which is frequently treated with methylphenidate. The short-term response to treatment with methylphenidate is a substantial decrease in dopamine transporter density, with improvement in neuropsychological tests. In this study, single-photon emission computed tomography was used to investigate possible long-term alterations in the cerebral dopamine system after cessation of treatment with methylphenidate in five children with ADHD. Three months after initiation of treatment with methylphenidate, a reduction of the dopamine transporter in the striatal system was observed. Methylphenidate was administered for a period of 9 to 20 months. Follow-up with single-photon emission computed tomography after withdrawal of methylphenidate medication disclosed an increase of dopamine transporter activity comparable with pretreatment values. The observed upregulation of dopamine transporter activity might support the assumption that methylphenidate does not lead to permanent damage of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways.
Systemic immune abnormalities have no known relevance to brain dysfunction in autism. In order to find evidence for neuroinflammation, we compared levels of sensitive indicators of immune activation: quinolinic acid, neopterin, and biopterin, as well as multiple cytokines and cytokine receptors, in cerebrospinal fluid and serum from children with autism, to control subjects with other neurologic disorders. In cerebrospinal fluid from 12 children with autism, quinolinic acid (P = 0.037) and neopterin (P = 0.003) were decreased, and biopterin (P = 0.040) was elevated, compared with control subjects. In sera from 35 persons with autism, among cytokines, only tumor necrosis factor receptor II was elevated compared with controls (P < 0.02). Decreased quinolinic acid and neopterin in cerebrospinal fluid are paradoxical and suggest dysmaturation of metabolic pathways and absence of concurrent infection, respectively, in autism. Alternatively, they may be produced by microglia but remain localized and not expressed in cerebrospinal fluid.
We studied the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and determine the incidence of hypotension after intravenous administration in medium- (MCU) and intensive care (ICU) patients.
All patients on the ICU/MCU starting with paracetamol i.v. were included, yielding 38 patients. Blood samples were collected at predetermined time points to determine paracetamol serum concentration. The number of patients with a clinically relevant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the number of patients that needed intervention to regain an acceptable blood pressure level were assessed.
Overall, pharmacokinetic data were roughly comparable with earlier publications, but differences were noted in the subgroup ICU patients. Also, there was a trend to a larger peak serum concentration (p = 0.052) and a significantly smaller volume of distribution (p = 0.033) in MCU patients compared with ICU patients. Twenty-two percent (22%) and 33% of patients had a clinically relevant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) 15 and 30 min after start of paracetamol infusion, respectively. In six patients (16%), an intervention was needed to correct blood pressure. Overall, SBP was significantly reduced at T = 15 min and 30 min postinfusion (p < 0.003 at both time points) when compared with SBP at the start of paracetamol infusion.
Further research on differences in paracetamol pharmacokinetics between ICU and MCU patients is warranted, as these differences might result in differences in efficacy. Furthermore, administration of paracetamol i.v. as potential cause of hypotension in the critically ill patient must not be overlooked.
Formaldehyde is cytotoxic and carcinogenic to the rat nasal respiratory epithelium inducing tumors after 12 months. Glutaraldehyde is also cytotoxic but is not carcinogenic to nasal epithelium even after 24 months. Both aldehydes induce similar acute and subchronic histopathology that is characterized by inflammation, hyperplasia, and squamous metaplasia. Because early aldehyde-induced lesions are microscopically similar, we investigated whether transcriptional patterns using cDNA technology could explain the different cancer outcomes. Treatments included 1-, 5-, or 28-day exposure by nasal instillation of formaldehyde solution (400 mM) or glutaraldehyde solution (20 mM). Animals were euthanized and the nasal respiratory epithelium removed for gene expression analysis and a subset of rats treated for 28 days was processed for microscopic examination. RNA was isolated and processed for expression assessment using Clontech Atlas Toxicology II Arrays. Both aldehydes induced hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and inflammatory infiltrates with scattered apoptotic bodies in the epithelium covering luminal surfaces of the nasoturbinate, maxilloturbinate, and nasal septum. A subset of 80 genes that were the most variant between the treated and control included the functional categories of DNA repair and apoptosis. Hierarchical clustering discriminated chemical treatment effects after 5 days of exposure, with 6 clusters of genes distinguishing formaldehyde from glutaraldehyde. These data suggest that although both aldehydes induced similar short-term cellular phenotypes, gene expression could distinguish glutaraldehyde from formaldehyde. The gene expression patterns suggest that glutaraldehyde's lack of carcinogenicity may be due to its greater toxicity from lack of DNA-repair, greater mitochondrial damage, and increased apoptosis.
Eleven susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) were identified by previous studies; however, a large portion of the genetic risk for this disease remains unexplained. We conducted a large, two-stage meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry. In stage 1, we used genotyped and imputed data (7,055,881 SNPs) to perform meta-analysis on 4 previously published GWAS data sets consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls. In stage 2, 11,632 SNPs were genotyped and tested for association in an independent set of 8,572 Alzheimer's disease cases and 11,312 controls. In addition to the APOE locus (encoding apolipoprotein E), 19 loci reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis, of which 11 are newly associated with Alzheimer's disease.
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a challenging global health problem. To identify genetic loci involved in chronic HBV infection, we designed a three-phase genome-wide association study in Han Chinese populations. The discovery phase included 951 HBV carriers (cases) and 937 individuals who had naturally cleared HBV infection (controls) and was followed by independent replications with a total of 2,248 cases and 3,051 controls and additional replications with 1,982 HBV carriers and 2,622 controls from the general population. We identified two new loci associated with chronic HBV infection: rs3130542 at 6p21.33 (near HLA-C, odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, P = 9.49 × 10(-14)) and rs4821116 at 22q11.21 (in UBE2L3, OR = 0.82, P = 1.71 × 10(-12)). Additionally, we replicated the previously identified associations of HLA-DP and HLA-DQ variants at 6p21.32 with chronic HBV infection. These findings highlight the importance of HLA-C and UBE2L3 in the clearance of HBV infection in addition to HLA-DP and HLA-DQ.
In 35 patients (ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high-pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine. Cimetidine clearance decreased with age. The extrapolated 6-hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose, after intravenous cimetidine, increased with age of the patients. The ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance (Rc) averaged 4.8 +/- 2.0, indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine. Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine, suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process. There was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1.25 microgram/ml. Thus, high cimetidine levels alone do not always induce dementia.
It is recognized that some mutated cancer genes contribute to the development of many cancer types, whereas others are cancer type specific. For genes that are mutated in multiple cancer classes, mutations are usually similar in the different affected cancer types. Here, however, we report exquisite tumor type specificity for different histone H3.3 driver alterations. In 73 of 77 cases of chondroblastoma (95%), we found p.Lys36Met alterations predominantly encoded in H3F3B, which is one of two genes for histone H3.3. In contrast, in 92% (49/53) of giant cell tumors of bone, we found histone H3.3 alterations exclusively in H3F3A, leading to p.Gly34Trp or, in one case, p.Gly34Leu alterations. The mutations were restricted to the stromal cell population and were not detected in osteoclasts or their precursors. In the context of previously reported H3F3A mutations encoding p.Lys27Met and p.Gly34Arg or p.Gly34Val alterations in childhood brain tumors, a remarkable picture of tumor type specificity for histone H3.3 driver alterations emerges, indicating that histone H3.3 residues, mutations and genes have distinct functions.
The leading cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with coronary heart disease is plaque rupture. Between 6% and 12% of AMI patients have angiographically normal coronary arteries. However, new procedures have demonstrated the limits of coronarography and challenged the existence of this situation. Angiograms may fail to detect minimal lesions whereas, in many cases, intravascular sonography reveals small atherosclerotic plaques. With the development of intravascular sonography and multislice computed tomography, the prevalence of myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries has fallen to about 1%. Myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries may be due to coronary vasospasm, hypercoagulable states, intense sympathetic stimulation, non atherosclerotic coronary disease, alcohol or cocaine abuse, and systemic diseases. In a series of 1205 AMI patients, we found no significant coronary disease in 45 patients, but intravascular sonography showed minimal intracoronary plaque in 21 of these cases. The 24 patients without significant lesions were young, had no risk factors for AMI without a prodrome, low peak creatine release, a small reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction after thrombolysis or angioplasty, and good outcome at 26 months. The mechanisms of AMI in these 24 patients were coronary spasm, myocardial bridge, a prothrombotic state, contraceptive pill usage, and drug or alcohol abuse. The diferential diagnoses of these cases of AMI are acute myocarditis and stress cardiomyopathy, and apical left ventricular ballooning. Initial management is the same as for "conventional" AMI, including pain relief nitrates, antiplatelet agents, heparin, thrombolysis or angioplasty in the acute phase, and ACE inhibitors. Patients with spasm should receive calcium antagonists rather than beta-blockers. The prognosis of these patients is better than that of patients with atherosclerotic lesions. They nonetheless need close follow-up and strict secondary prevention measures, including smoking cessation and prevention of dyslipidemia and diabetes.
Amantadine has been used since 1969 in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 1970, were described the special symptoms noted in the lower limbs due to this drug. The authors, after a review of the various disturbances, have studied 10 cases by Capillaroscopy. They emphasize the interest of the study of this abnormality of the micro-circulation, producing vaso-constriction of the arterioles and venules.
Cannabicyclohexanol (CP-47,497-C8) is a representative of a group of cannabimimetic cyclohexylphenols which is added to herbal mixtures as a cannabis substitute since 2008. Although in the beginning CP-47,497-C8 was the main ingredient of "Spice" and similar products, it was partly replaced by aminoalkylindole-type cannabinoid receptor agonists like JWH-018, JWH-073 or JWH-250, but never completely disappeared from the market. Since information on its toxicological properties is scarce, we investigated the effects of the drug in human derived cell lines. The cytotoxic effects were studied in a panel of assays (SRB, XTT, LDHe and NR tests) in a buccal derived (TR146) and a liver derived (HepG2) cell line. The strongest effects were seen in the two former assays at levels ≥ 7.5 μM indicating that the compound interferes with protein synthesis and causes membrane damage. In additional comet assays, DNA damage was detected at levels ≥10 μM. Experiments with lesion specific enzymes showed that these effects are not due to oxidative damage of DNA bases. The negative findings obtained in Salmonella/microsome assays and the positive results of micronucleus tests with the cell lines indicate that the compound does not cause gene mutations but acts on the chromosomal level. In contrast to other synthetic cannabinoids, no indication for estrogenic/antiestrogenic properties was seen in a luciferase assay with bone marrow derived U2-OS cells. In conclusion, our findings show that the drug has only weak cytotoxic properties. However, the induction of chromosomal damage indicates that it may cause adverse effects in users due to its impact on the stability of the genetic material.
Mutations in human copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause an inherited form of the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we present structures of the pathogenic SOD1 variants D124V and H80R, both of which demonstrate compromised zinc-binding sites. The disruption of the zinc-binding sites in H80R SOD1 leads to conformational changes in loop elements, permitting non-native SOD1-SOD1 interactions that mediate the assembly of these proteins into higher-order filamentous arrays. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that these SOD1 variants are more prone to monomerization than the wild-type enzyme. Although D124V and H80R SOD1 proteins appear to have fully functional copper-binding sites, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (ICP-MS) and anomalous scattering X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that zinc (not copper) occupies the copper-binding sites in these variants. The absence of copper in these proteins, together with the results of covalent thiol modification experiments in yeast strains with and without the gene encoding the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS), suggests that CCS may not fully act on newly translated forms of these polypeptides. Overall, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that immature mutant SOD1 species contribute to toxicity in SOD1-linked ALS.
Neurotoxicity is the major side effect occurring during the clinical use of vincristine (VCR). Animal models predictive of potential neurotoxicity would be very useful in the preclinical development of new vinca compounds. To simulate conditions in which neurotoxicity is produced during the clinical use of VCR, experimental animals (except the guinea pig) were given the test compounds by the iv route over a prolonged time period. Doses were selected based on the production of leukopenia. Vindesine (VDS), a chemically modified vinblastine (VBL) product, was compared with VCR and VBL in animal studies. Definite neurotoxic manifestations developed when VCR was given to chickens, cats, and monkeys. The administration of VDS or VBL did not produce neurotoxic signs in these species. The mouse, rat, dog, and guinea pig were not found to be useful models. Thus, it would appear the chicken, cat, and monkey would be appropriate animal models for the preclinical testing of new vinca compounds.
2 young, menstruating females without any of the major risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia) developed acute myocaridal infarctions while taking oral contraceptives; their clinical histories and laboratory and arteriographic studies are presented. In the first patient (aged 29) who took Ortho-Novum 2 mg. for 11 months prior to infarction and who had an abnormal glucose tolerance test, selective coronary angiography revealed a segmental occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. In the second patient (aged 38) who took Enovid for several years prior to infarction, selective coronary angiography showed slight irregularity of the left anterior descending coronary artery; no evidence of akinesis or dyskinesis of the ventricular wall was noted. Although incidence of coronary artery disease in young, menstruating women has always been very low, recently there have been scattered case reports of women with acute myocardial infarction in absence of major risk factors; all cases shared the common features of oral contraceptive use prior to infarction, and unusual distribution and peculiar appearance of lesions in coronary arteries. Such reports, although rare, in young females taking synthetic estrogen do suggest that a relationship may exist between oral contraceptive agents and thromboembolic phenomena, especially coronary thrombosis. Mechanisms by which oral contraceptives might precipitate thrombosis are discussed. It is suggested that coronary artery disease should be suspected in young oral contraceptors suffering chest pain even though they are still menstruating and are free of major risk factors.
