We compared the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin (ASA) and indomethacin in the rat gastric mucosa depending on the route of administration, together with the expression of COX-2.
Animals fasted for 18 h were given ASA or indomethacin, either p.o. or s.c., and the stomach was examined 4 h later.
Indomethacin decreased mucosal PGE(2 )level, increased gastric motility, and caused gastric lesions with the up-regulation of COX-2 expression, irrespective of the route of administration. ASA induced both damage and COX-2 expression in the stomach when given p.o. but not s.c., despite decreasing the PGE(2) level similarly via either route of administration. Gastric motility was temporarily increased and gastric potential difference (PD) was markedly decreased by ASA given p.o. PGE(2) and atropine, although preventing ASA-induced gastric lesions as well as hypermotility, affected neither the COX-2 expression nor PD reduction induced by p.o. ASA. By contrast, the COX-2 expression induced by indomethacin was prevented by both PGE(2) and atropine.
ASA given p.o. caused damage in the stomach, together with the up-regulation of COX-2 expression, and this expression may be due to the topical irritative action, rather than being a result of PG deficiency. The expression of COX-2 after indomethacin is associated with gastric hypermotility due to PG deficiency.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as an inducer of cell death and survival or proliferative factor, in a cell-type-specific and concentration-dependent manner. All of these roles are critical to ischemia-induced renal functional impairment and progressive fibrotic changes in the kidney. In an effort to define the role of ROS in the proliferation of tubular epithelial cells and of interstitial cells in kidneys recovering after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, experimental mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral kidney ischemia and administered with manganese(III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (MnTMPyP), a superoxide dismutase mimetic, from 2 to 15 days after I/R for 14 days daily (earlier and longer) and from 8 to 15 days after I/R for 8 days daily (later and shorter). Cell proliferation was assessed via 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays for 20 h before the harvest of kidneys. After I/R, the numbers of BrdU-incorporating cells increased both in the tubules and interstitium. MnTMPyP administration was shown to accelerate the proliferation of tubular epithelial cells, presenting tubule-specific marker proteins along tubular segments, whereas it attenuated the proliferation of interstitial cells, evidencing α-smooth muscle actin, fibroblast-specific protein-1, F4/80, and NADPH oxidase-2 proteins; these results indicated that ROS attenuates tubular cell regeneration, but accelerates interstitial cell proliferation. Earlier and longer MnTMPyP treatment more effectively inhibited tissue superoxide formation, the increment of interstitial cells, and the decrement of epithelial cells compared with later and shorter treatment. After I/R, apoptotic cells appeared principally in the tubular epithelial cells, but not in the interstitial cells, thereby indicating that ROS is harmful in tubule cells, but is not in interstitial cells. In conclusion, ROS generated after I/R injury in cell proliferation and death performs a cell-type-specific and concentration-dependent role, even within the same tissues, and timely intervention of ROS is crucial for effective therapies.
Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (also know as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase [sFlt]-1) is a key causative factor of preeclampsia. Resveratrol, a plant phytoalexin, has antiinflammatory and cardioprotective properties. We sought to determine the effect of resveratrol on sFlt-1 release.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, transformed human trophoblast-8 (HTR/SVneo)-8/SVneo trophoblast cells, or placental explants were incubated with cytokines and/or resveratrol. Conditioned media were assayed for sFlt-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell proteins used for Western blotting.
Resveratrol inhibited cytokine-induced release of sFlt-1 from normal placental explants and from preeclamptic placental explants. Preincubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells or HTR-8/SVneo cells with resveratrol abrogated sFlt-1 release. Resveratrol prevented the up-regulation of early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1), a transcription factor necessary for induction of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 gene and caused up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1, a cytoprotective enzyme found to be dysfunctional in preeclampsia.
In summary, resveratrol can inhibit sFlt-1 release and up-regulate heme oxygenase-1; thus, may offer therapeutic potential in preeclampsia.
Promising reports exist regarding the use of arsenic trioxide (ATO) as first-line treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although the in vitro effect of ATO is extensively studied, the in vivo mechanism(s) of ATO action is mostly unknown.
Newly diagnosed APL patients were involved and received ATO (0.15 mg.kg/day) for 28 days as induction followed by consolidation therapy. Bone marrow (BM) aspirates were obtained on days 0, 14 and 28 of treatment for further molecular studies. Clinical findings and white blood cell counts were recorded as well.
Complete remission was observed in 17 (85%) patients with the median duration of 28 days (18-38) and cumulative dosage of median 280 mg (180-350). Hyperleukocytosis and APL differentiation syndrome (63%), gastrointestinal disorders (30%), liver enzyme elevation and night sweating (50%) were the most prevalent side-effects. The expression of Bax, ERK1 and p38 proteins and caspase-3 activity increased significantly in promyelocytes of BM aspirates at days 14 and 28 of induction therapy.
These findings point toward the role of p38 and Bax in the induction of apoptosis, which was confirmed by increase in caspase-3 activity. However, the increase in ERK1 expression with regard to leukocytosis could translate to a proliferative/differentiation effect.
Papaverine, a potent coronary vasodilator, is now commonly used to measure coronary reserve. We recorded intracoronary electrogram in a patient who developed Torsade des pointes after 10 mg of papaverine. This was associated with marked prolongation of the QT interval. The ventricular tachycardia self-terminated with shortening of the QT interval. We believe that although papaverine is a good agent because of its short duration of action, it must be used cautiously because of its effects on repolarization, which can result in arrhythmias.
In view of the recently demonstrated extra-endocrine central actions of hypothalamic releasing hormones, we have investigated the effects of prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG) and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) on morphine-induced catalepsy. Although acute administration of PLG (10 mg kg-1 s.c.) slightly attenuated the cataleptic response, chronic PLG treatment (10 mg kg-1 s.c. for 10 days) virtually abolished morphine-induced catalepsy. TRH, administered subcutaneously, exhibited little or no anti-cataleptic activity. These results are discussed in relation to the possible central site of narcotic-induced catalepsy and the therapeutic potential of PLG in Parkinson's disease.
Carbamazepine (CBZ) is frequently used for treating epilepsy, but this drug causes cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) that may range from mild to severe. It is reported recently that the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502 is associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) induced by CBZ in Han Chinese. We examined HLA class I in 15 Japanese patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CBZ-induced cADRs (mild in 10 and severe = SJS in 5). HLA-B*1518, HLA-B*5901 and HLA-C*0704 alleles showed higher relative risks (above 10.0) for severe cADRs. The haplotype (HLA-A*2402-B*5901-C*0102) had high relative risk (16.09) for severe cADRs. In patients with severe cADRs, frequencies of HLA-A*1101, HLA-A*3303, HLA-B*1501, HLA-B*4403, HLA-B*5101, HLA-B*5201, HLA-C*0702, and HLA-C*1202 alleles are relatively lower than in the Japanese population. These data may suggest that HLA-B*5901 is one of the candidate markers for CBZ-induced SJS in Japanese.
The therapeutic use of Doxorubicin in the treatment of human solid tumors is restricted because of its cardiotoxicity. It has been demonstrated that D,L-Carnitine reduces or suppresses some of the cardiotoxic effects produced by the antibiotic. The results of this study, carried out on rat heart Langendorff preparation show that the decrease in heart rate, coronary flow, and contractile force, occurring after Doxorubicin infusion, was antagonized by the laevo-diasteroisomer; the dextroform was totally inactive. On the contrary, both forms increased phospholipid concentration in the myocardium. This would suggest that the reparatory effect of L-Carnitine against Doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is linked to the natural role played by this substance in metabolic processes.
To review reports of angiooedema and urticaria associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in the New Zealand Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring and Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme (IMMP) database.
Adverse reaction reports describing angiooedema and/or urticaria between April 1981 and December 1994 were examined. Captopril, enalapril and lisinopril were intensively monitored on the IMMP during this period.
Of a total of 116 reports there were 68 reports of angiooedema and 37 of urticaria alone and 11 where angiooedema and urticaria occurred in the same patient. The total number of patients is unknown, but cohorts of patients on captopril, enalapril and lisinopril in the IMMP were 16342, 25686 and 11235, totalling 53263 patients. There were 63 reports of angiooedema/urticaria in patients monitored on the IMMP, giving a reported rate of 1.2/1000 (0.9-1.5). Forty seven reactions occurred between 3 weeks and 4 years after commencement of therapy. Severe angiooedema occurred in 9 patients with early-onset angiooedema and 6 with late-onset angiooedema. There were no deaths. Seventeen patients had up to 12 episodes before diagnosis. Angiooedema/ urticaria occurred without gender preference. Although a dose relationship was not apparent, 3 patients developed angiooedema or urticaria after an increase in dose.
Although reactions are more common shortly after initiation of ACEI therapy, late onset reactions may be less well recognised. Clinicians should be reminded, and ACEI data sheets should emphasise, that onset may be delayed for weeks or months, that patients may have multiple episodes with long symptom free intervals, and that angiooedema may occur with or without urticaria.
Folate intake is inversely related to risk of developing colorectal neoplasia. Associations between risk of colorectal neoplasia and polymorphisms in genes coding for enzymes involved in folate metabolism have also been reported, suggesting a relationship between genotype and development of colorectal neoplasia. To further investigate the effects of folate metabolism genotypes on colorectal neoplasia, we genotyped 546 patients participating in a randomized controlled trial of folate supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenoma recurrence. A significantly reduced risk of recurrence was observed in patients heterozygous for the MTRR A66G polymorphism [relative risk (RR), 0.64; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.46-0.90] or heterozygous for the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.97). Furthermore, a significant reduction in recurrence risk was seen in MTRR A66G heterozygotes who received folate supplements but not in those who did not receive folate. Patients heterozygous for the MTHFR C677T polymorphism had a nonsignificant risk reduction (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.69-1.23), as did patients with one or two variant alleles for the MTR A2756G polymorphism (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.60-1.12). No influence on recurrence risk was observed for the TSER, TSER 3R G>C, and TS 1494del6 variants. These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that germ line variants in folate metabolism genes influence the development of colorectal adenomas.
The incidence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-related cardiotoxicity seems to be dosage and schedule dependent. Although various other cardiac events have been reported in literature, a series of patients having transient asymptomatic bradycardia has not been reported in the literature as yet. We report such a series of patients who had transient asymptomatic bradycardia after being treated with continuous infusion 5-FU. We plan to do a Holter study during the period of bradycardia in subsequent patients and this may throw more light on the issue.
We report on dermatomyositis-like adverse cutaneous reactions following long-term maintenance therapy with hydroxyurea in two patients suffering from chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). In addition to non-specific side effects, such as xerosis, pruritus and hyperpigmentation, both patients presented with more specific skin changes, i.e. erythematous lesions, scaling, and partially atrophic areas distributed in a linear fashion on the dorsal aspects of the hands and fingers. In addition, teleangiectatic erythema of the face was present in both patients, and this was associated with oedema of the eyelids in one patient. Despite these dermatomyositis-like features there were no clinical signs of muscular involvement, and muscle-specific enzymes were within normal ranges. Skin biopsy specimens revealed an interface dermatitis characterized by a lichenoid cell infiltrate, vacuolar alteration of basal cells, necrotic keratinocytes within the spinous zone, focal hypergranulosis, ortho-hyperkeratosis and telangiectases in the upper part of the dermis. Analogous histopathological findings have been documented in lichen planus-like skin changes on the hands following hydroxyurea therapy. It seems doubtful whether there are actually any major differences between those skin changes described as dermatomyositis-like and those interpreted as lichen planus-like in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea therapy.
Pyridine substituted 3,4-dihydro-1H-quinolin-2-ones (e.g., 1-3) constitute a class of highly potent and selective inhibitors of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), a promising target for the treatment of hyperaldosteronism, congestive heart failure, and myocardial fibrosis. Among these, ethyl-substituted 3 possesses high selectivity against CYP1A2. Rigidification of 3 by incorporation of the ethyl group into a 5- or 6-membered ring affords compounds with a pyrroloquinolinone or pyridoquinolinone molecular scaffold (e.g., 4 and 5). It was found that these molecules are even more potent and selective CYP11B2 inhibitors than their corresponding open-chain analogues. Moreover, pyrroloquinolinone 4 exhibits no inhibition of the six most important hepatic CYP enzymes as well as a bioavailability in the range of the marketed drug fadrozole. The SAR studies disclose that subtle changes in the heterocyclic moiety are responsible for either a strong or a weak inhibition of the highly homologous 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). These results are not only important for fine-tuning the selectivity of CYP11B2 inhibitors but also for the development of selective CYP11B1 inhibitors that are of interest for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome and metabolic syndrome.
Footshock reinstates cocaine seeking in cocaine-experienced rats by inducing corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and glutamate release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and thus activating VTA dopaminergic neurons. Footshock-induced VTA glutamate release, dopamine activation and reinstatements are blocked by VTA administration of a alpha-helical CRF, a nonselective CRF receptor antagonist. The effects of selective CRF antagonists have not yet been reported.
The present studies were designed to explore the roles of VTA CRF receptor subtypes and CRF-BP in these effects induced by footshock.
Rats were first trained to lever-press for intravenous cocaine (1 mg/infusion/0.13 ml, FR-1 schedule), and then tested under extinction conditions until response rates returned to the pretraining baseline. Reinstatements, VTA glutamate and dopamine levels [microdialysis with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)] were then assessed, under various pharmacological conditions, after mild inescapable footshock.
Footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking and release of VTA glutamate and dopamine were blocked by selective blockade of VTA CRF(2) receptors (CRF(2)Rs) but not CRF(1)Rs. VTA perfusion of CRF or CRF(2)R agonists that have strong affinity for CRF-BP mimicked the effects induced by footshock while CRFR agonists that do not bind CRF-BP were ineffective. CRF(6-33), which competes for the CRF binding site on CRF-BP, attenuated the effects of CRF or urocortin I on VTA glutamate and dopamine release and on reinstatement of cocaine seeking.
The present studies revealed a role of VTA CRF-BP and suggest an involvement of CRF(2)R in the effectiveness of stress in triggering glutamate and dopamine release and cocaine seeking in drug-experienced animals.
Carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus (BE) is associated with an increased expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) 2. However, there has been no direct evidence that inhibition of COX-2 prevents cancer in BE. We studied the effect of MF-Tricyclic, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on the development of BE and adenocarcinoma in a rat model.
Four weeks after esophagojejunostomy, 105 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to a chow containing MF-Tricyclic or Sulindac, or a placebo. Ninety-six (92%) rats completed the study and were sacrificed at 28 +/- 2 weeks. The animals were assessed for the presence of cancer, tumor volume, BE, degree of inflammation, and COX-2 expression and activity.
MF-Tricyclic and Sulindac reduced the relative risk of development of esophageal cancer by 55% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 43%-66%, P < 0.008) and by 79% (95% CI = 68%-87%, P < 0.001), respectively, compared with controls. No significant differences were noted in the risk of esophageal cancer between the MF-Tricyclic and the Sulindac group (P = 0.34). The median tumor volume was not significantly different among the 3 groups (P = 0.081). Moderate to severe degree of inflammation was significantly more common (P = 0.005) in the control compared with the MF-Tricyclic and the Sulindac group; however, the prevalence of BE was not significantly different between groups (P = 0.98). Rats in the control group had higher tissue PGE2 level compared with the MF-Tricyclic and Sulindac groups (P = 0.038).
Selective and nonselective COX-2 inhibitors can inhibit inflammation, COX-2 activity, and development of adenocarcinoma induced by reflux. This provides direct evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may have chemopreventive potential in BE.
Previous studies showed that prolonged access to cocaine or heroin self-administration (long access, or LgA) produces an escalation in drug intake not observed with limited access to the drug (short access, or ShA). The present experiment employed in vivo microdialysis to test the role of alterations in drug pharmacokinetics and/or efficacy in increasing dopamine (DA) levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) during cocaine intake escalation. In experiment 1, both ShA and LgA rats were challenged with passive intravenous administration of cocaine (0.125-1 mg/injection). Regardless of the doses tested, there was no difference between groups in the ability of cocaine to increase NAcc DA levels and no group differences in the temporal profile of dialysate cocaine levels. In experiment 2, cocaine and DA concentrations were measured during cocaine self-administration. Self-administration produced sustained increases of DA in the NAcc with LgA rats maintaining greater steady levels of DA (750% of baseline) than ShA rats (400% of baseline). The difference in the LgA versus ShA rats was not due to differences in the efficacy of cocaine to elevate DA levels, or in the rate of cocaine metabolism, but was directly related to the amount of self-administered cocaine. These findings show that changes in cocaine efficacy or pharmacokinetics do not play a critical role in cocaine intake escalation.
Connexin 32 (Cx32) is a major gap junction protein in the liver. The authors previously demonstrated that transgenic rats carrying a dominant negative mutant of Cx32 (Cx32ΔTg) have much decreased capacity for gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and increased susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis as compared to littermate wild-type (wt) rats. To evaluate the age-dependent susceptibility to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and alteration of GJIC function, male Cx32ΔTg and wt rats at 10, 30, or 85 weeks old were given a single intraperitoneal administration of DEN (40 mg/rat) and sacrificed 12 weeks later. The number and area of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive preneoplastic foci were significantly increased in the liver of 10- and 30-wk-old Cx32ΔTg rats compared with age-matched wt. However, in the 85-wk-old rats, both Cx32ΔTg and wt rats had similarly large number and area of GST-P-positive foci, and the difference was not significant. Interestingly, function of hepatic GJIC was reduced and protein and mRNA expression of Cx32 were decreased with aging in wt rats. These results suggest that a decline of hepatic intercellular communication through gap junction results in increased susceptibility to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in aged rats.
The influence of substance P 3 (microgram/kg) and (+)-tubocurarine (850 micrograms/kg) on the Bezold-Jarisch reflex in urethane-anaesthetized rats was studied. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex was induced by the 5-HT3 receptor agonist phenylbiguanide (0.3, 1, 3 and 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) and by capsaicin (10 micrograms/kg i.v.). The 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (10 micrograms/kg) abolished the phenylbiguanide- but not the capsaicin-stimulated bradycardia, indicating that phenylbiguanide and capsaicin act via different trigger mechanisms (5-HT3 receptor-dependent and -independent, respectively). Substance P significantly potentiated the phenylbiguanide- but not the capsaicin-induced decrease in heart rate. Also, when the phenylbiguanide-induced response was amplified by substance P, it was abolished by ondansetron. (+)-Tubocurarine inhibited the phenylbiguanide-induced bradycardia, but did not affect the capsaicin-stimulated decrease in heart rate. Our results demonstrate that substance P potentiates but (+)-tubocurarine inhibits the 5-HT3 receptor-mediated Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Both effects are probably due to direct influences of the drugs on the 5-HT3 receptors on sensory vagal nerves in the heart.
We examined whether adrenomedullin, a vasoactive peptide expressed in the heart, modulates the increase in blood pressure, changes in systolic and diastolic function, and left ventricular hypertrophy produced by long-term administration of ANG II or norepinephrine in rats. Subcutaneous administration of adrenomedullin (1.5 microg.kg(-1).h(-1)) for 1 wk inhibited the ANG II-induced (33.3 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) sc) increase in mean arterial pressure by 67% (P < 0.001) but had no effect of norepinephrine-induced (300 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) sc) hypertension. Adrenomedullin enhanced the ANG II-induced improvement in systolic function, resulting in a further 9% increase (P < 0.01) in the left ventricular ejection fraction and 19% increase (P < 0.05) in the left ventricular fractional shortening measured by echocardiography, meanwhile norepinephrine-induced changes in systolic function were remained unaffected. Adrenomedullin had no effect on ANG II- or norepinephrine-induced left ventricular hypertrophy or expression of hypertrophy-associated genes, including contractile protein and natriuretic peptide genes. The present study shows that adrenomedullin selectively suppressed the increase in blood pressure and augmented the improvement of systolic function induced by ANG II. Because adrenomedullin had no effects on ANG II- and norepinephrine-induced left ventricular hypertrophy, circulating adrenomedullin appears to act mainly as a regulator of vascular tone and cardiac function.
A 16-yr-old boy who was receiving amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias developed a Reye's syndrome-like illness several days after an upper respiratory infection. Liver biopsy revealed microvesicular fat and spotty hepatocellular necrosis, typical of Reye's syndrome. Recovery was complete. This case report suggests that medications other than aspirin may predispose to Reye's syndrome, and that children receiving amiodarone should receive prophylaxis against influenza B and chicken pox.
A retrospective survey of serum potassium measurements in a blood pressure clinic provided evidence that potassium supplements averaging 24 mmol daily were effective in elevating serum potassium concentration and reducing the incidence of hypokalaemia in diuretic-treated hypertensives. In patients treated with bendrofluazide the serum potassium concentration was related to the dose of diuretic, but not to age, sex, body weight, supine blood pressure or serum creatinine. There was no evidence that drugs other than diuretics or potassium (including beta-adrenergic blockers) had a clinically significant influence on serum potassium. The major part of the variation in serum potassium between patients could not be explained by the variables examined.
Electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures and behavioral convulsions begin to appear spontaneously a few weeks after chemoconvulsant-induced status epilepticus (SE) and thereafter become more intense. This indicates the progressive development of a long-lasting epileptic focus. In addition, chemoconvulsant-induced SE increases neuronal proliferation in the dentate subgranular zone (SGZ) and ectopic migration of newborn neurons into the dentate hilus of adult animals. These seizure-induced newborn neurons, especially ectopic granule cells in the dentate hilus, are believed to facilitate the development of epileptic foci in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy. In the present study, we examined the effects of a novel antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, on the appearance of spontaneous EEG seizures and on the generation of newborn neurons, especially of ectopic granule cells in the dentate hilus, following kainate-induced SE. Levetiracetam treatment for 25 days, initiated 24 hours after induction of kainate-induced SE, significantly decreased the mean duration of spontaneous EEG seizures 58 days later. Levetiracetam treatment also prevented an SE-induced increase in the number of ectopic granule cells observed 58 days after kainate administration by suppressing neuronal proliferation in the dentate SGZ and abnormal migration of newborn neurons from the dentate SGZ to the hilus. These results are in accord with a previous report that an antimitotic agent that reduced the number of newborn neurons significantly decreased the frequency of spontaneous convulsions 1 month after pilocarpine-induced SE. This evidence from the kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy suggests that levetiracetam may exert antiepileptogenic effects through the suppression of seizure-induced neurogenesis.
Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is important for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced liver fibrogenesis. Hepatic stellate cells have been recognized as its major cellular source in the liver. Here we demonstrate the induction of CTGF expression in hepatocytes of damaged livers and identify a molecular mechanism responsible for it. CTGF expression was found by immunohistochemistry in bile duct epithelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and hepatocytes in fibrotic liver tissue from patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Similarly, CTGF expression was induced in hepatocytes of carbon tetrachloride-treated mice. CTGF expression and secretion were detected spontaneously in a medium of hepatocytes after 3 days of culture, which was enhanced by stimulation with TGF-beta. TGF-beta-induced CTGF expression was mediated through the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/Smad3 pathway, whereas activin receptor-like kinase 1 activation antagonized this effect. CTGF expression in the liver tissue of TGF-beta transgenic mice correlated with serum TGF-beta levels. Smad7 overexpression in cultured hepatocytes abrogated TGF-beta-dependent and intrinsic CTGF expression, indicating that TGF-beta signaling was required. In line with these data, hepatocyte-specific transgenic Smad7 reduced CTGF expression in carbon tetrachloride-treated animals, whereas in Smad7 knockout mice, it was enhanced. Furthermore, an interferon gamma treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection induced Smad7 expression in hepatocytes, leading to decreased CTGF expression and fibrogenesis.
Our data provide evidence for the profibrogenic activity of TGF-beta directed to hepatocytes and mediated via the up-regulation of CTGF. We identify ALK5-dependent Smad3 signaling as the responsible pathway inducing CTGF expression, which can be hindered by an activated activin receptor-like kinase 1 pathway and completely inhibited by TGF-beta antagonist Smad7.
Dietary copper deficiency is associated with a variety of manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, including hyperlipidemia and fatty liver. Fructose feeding has been reported to exacerbate complications of copper deficiency. In this study, we investigated whether copper deficiency plays a role in fructose-induced fatty liver and explored the potential underlying mechanism(s).
Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either an adequate copper or a marginally copper deficient diet for 4 weeks. Deionized water or deionized water containing 30% fructose (w/v) was also given ad lib. Copper and iron status, hepatic injury and steatosis, and duodenum copper transporter-1 (Ctr-1) were assessed.
Fructose feeding further impaired copper status and led to iron overload. Liver injury and fat accumulation were significantly induced in marginal copper deficient rats exposed to fructose as evidenced by robustly increased plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and hepatic triglyceride. Hepatic carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I (CPT I) expression was significantly inhibited, whereas hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) was markedly up-regulated in marginal copper deficient rats fed with fructose. Hepatic antioxidant defense system was suppressed and lipid peroxidation was increased by marginal copper deficiency and fructose feeding. Moreover, duodenum Ctr-1 expression was significantly increased by marginal copper deficiency, whereas this increase was abrogated by fructose feeding.
Our data suggest that high fructose-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be due, in part, to inadequate dietary copper. Impaired duodenum Ctr-1 expression seen in fructose feeding may lead to decreased copper absorption, and subsequent copper deficiency.
The involvement of blood microvessels, representing the anatomic site of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), in brain damage induced by prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or valproic acid (VPA) was studied in four-week-old rats. The immunogold procedure was applied for localization at the ultrastructural level of endogenous albumin and glucose transporter (GLUT-1) in three brain regions: cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Four groups of rats were used: (1) untreated control, (2) prenatally VPA-treated, (3) prenatally LPS-treated, and (4) prenatally LPS- and VPA-treated. The functional state of the BBB was evaluated as follows: (a) by its tightness, i.e., permeability to blood-borne albumin, and (b) by the expression of GLUT-1 in the endothelial cells (ECs). Using morphometry, the labelling density for GLUT-1 was recorded over luminal and abluminal plasma membranes of the ECs, also providing information on their functional polarity. No extensive increase of vascular permeability and/or any considerable dysfunction of the BBB in experimental groups nos. 2 and 3 were observed, although in solitary vascular profiles, increased endocytosis or even transcytosis of albumin by ECs was noted. In experimental group no. 4, some vascular profiles showed scanty leakage (microleakage), manifested by the presence of immunosignals for albumin in the perivascular area. Although some fluctuations in the expression of GLUT-1 occurred in all experimental groups, especially in group no. 3, a most pronounced and significant diminution of the labelling density, in all three regions of the brain, was observed in group no. 4. This finding suggests the synergistic action of prenatally applied LPS and VPA that affects specific transport functions of glucose in the microvascular endothelium. The diminished or disturbed supply of glucose to selected brain regions can be one of the factors leading to previously observed behavioral disturbances in similarly treated rats.
