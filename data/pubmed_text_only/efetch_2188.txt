Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations in one of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, which encode the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively 123. Common features of TSC include intractable epilepsy, mental retardation, and autistic features. TSC is associated with specific brain lesions, including cortical tubers, subependymal nodules and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. In addition, this disease frequently produces characteristic tumors, termed hamartomas, in the kidneys, heart, skin, retina, and lungs. Disease severity in TSC can be quite variable and is not determined by the primary mutation alone. In fact, there is often considerable variability in phenotype within single families, where all affected individuals carry the same mutation. Factors suspected to influence phenotype in TSC include the specific primary mutation, random occurrence of second-hit somatic mutations, mosaicism, "modifying genes", and environmental factors. In addition to these factors, we hypothesize that differences in mRNA expression from the non-mutated TSC allele, or possibly from the mutated allele, play a part in modifying disease severity. Common genetic variants that regulate mRNA expression have previously been shown to play important roles in human phenotypic variability, including disease susceptibility. A prediction based on this idea is that common regulatory variants that influence disease severity in TSC should be detectable in non-affected individuals.
A PCR/primer extension assay was used to measure allele specific expression of TSC1 and TSC2 mRNAs in leukocytes isolated from normal volunteers. This assay can be used to measure "allelic expression imbalance" (AEI) in individuals by making use of heterozygous "marker" single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within their mRNA.
In this study we show for the first time that TSC1 and TSC2 genes exhibit allele-specific differences in mRNA expression in blood leukocytes isolated from normal individuals.
These results support the possibility that allele-specific variation in TSC mRNA expression contributes to the variable severity of symptoms in TSC patients.
The development of tolerance and reverse tolerance and reverse tolerance to the cataleptic effects of selective D1 antagonist, SCH23390, and the mainly D2 antagonist, haloperidol, was investigated in mice that had been chronically treated (7 or 30 days) with haloperidol (1 mg/kg SC), SCH23390 (0.5 mg/kg SC), or saline (5 ml/kg SC). In control animals, SCH23390 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg IP) and haloperidol (0.1-1.0 mg/kg IP) produced cataleptic responses in a dose-dependent manner, although the responses had different time course profiles. SCH23390 catalepsy had a rapid onset but a short duration, whereas haloperidol catalepsy had a slower onset and longer duration. This could be due to differences in lipid solubility of the drugs, or at least pertly to an action of the drugs on different neuronal pathways. The cataleptic effects of SCH23390 (0.3 mg/kg IP) and haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg IP) were significantly reduced in mice when given 24 h, but not 72 h, after the last dose of a 7 day-pretreatment course (short-term treatment) of SCH23390. However, after long-term treatment (30 days) with SCH23390, a challenge dose of SCH23390 exhibited reverse tolerance (i.e., increased catalepsy) when given 7-21 days, but not 1-3 days, after the last injection of the SCH23390 pretreatment course. In contrast, haloperidol catalepsy was not affected by long-term SCH23390 treatment. However, after the last dose of long-term haloperidol treatment both SCH23390 and haloperidol exhibited tolerance to their cataleptic effects at 1-3 days, a normal response at 7 days, and an exaggerated response (reverse tolerance) at 15-21 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
As atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used in the treatment of childhood behavioural disorders either as monotherapy or in combination with other medications, there is a need to know more about their safety, in particular during switching to and from methylphenidate treatment, as antipsychotics and methylphenidate have opposing effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission. This report is about three cases of children who developed severe adverse reactions during switching from risperidone to methylphenidate. The first patient was a 6-year-old boy, diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). He developed severe hyperactivity and agitation on taking methylphenidate after the discontinuation of risperidone treatment. The second patient was a girl of 6, already on risperidone for ADHD and borderline intellectual functioning when referred. She displayed severe hyperactivity, agitation and irritability upon switching to methylphenidate medication. The third patient was a 15-year-old female adolescent with a similar clinical course as the previous patients. In all the cases described here, it is only with the discontinuation of methylphenidate that the adverse reactions resolved and readministration of methylphenidate in two patients did not produce any adverse effect after a drug-free interval. Functional regulation of certain neuroreceptors during risperidone treatment may lead to altered behavioural responses upon switching to methylphenidate. Thus, a drug-free interval is recommended in order to prevent adverse reactions.
Buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist licensed for the treatment of anxiety. Other anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines show significant sedative and other unwanted effects on cognition. Studies to date have yet to investigate cognitive effects of buspirone using well-validated computerized tests. The aim of this study was to assess acute subjective and cognitive effects of buspirone in healthy volunteers. Sixty healthy male volunteers received 20 mg buspirone, 30 mg buspirone, or placebo per os in a double-blind parallel groups design (N=20 per group). Subjective ratings (visual analogue scales) were completed at baseline, and at 1.5 and 3.5 hours post-capsule. Cognitive assessment was undertaken between 1.5 and 3.5 hours post-capsule, including tests of memory, executive planning, impulse control, decision making and cognitive flexibility. The 30 mg buspirone group showed significantly higher subjective ratings of contentedness 3.5 hours after capsule relative to placebo. Treatment and placebo groups did not differ significantly on cognitive measures. In contrast to benzodiazepines, the anxiolytic buspirone appears to lack detectable deleterious effects on cognition when administered acutely at clinically meaningful doses. Future research directions are discussed in relation to acute and chronic studies in neuropsychiatric populations.
To describe an episode of thyroid associated orbitopathy (TAO) following the initiation of thiazolidinedione (TZD).
We report a female patient with a history of Graves' disease and stabilised thyroid associated orbitopathy for 2.5 years, who experienced rapid progression of TAO after the initiation of thiazolidinedione for glycemic control. Following the discontinuation of TZD, the patient experienced subsequent stabilisation of disease and normalization of vision. The medical history, ophthalmic findings, and clinical course are discussed.
Thiazolidinediones may exacerbate TAO, and this should be taken into consideration when selecting treatment for diabetic patients with a history of autoimmune thyroid disorders.
Despite obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia have been described for over 60 years, their clinical significance and treatment still remain unclear. Described below is a schizophrenic patient with obsessional thinking and compulsive rituals who markedly reduced the obsessive-compulsive symptoms after fluoxetine was added to neuroleptic treatment.
Time is of the essence for effective intervention in acute ischemic stroke. Efforts including stroke teams that are "on call" around-the-clock are emerging to reduce the time from emergency room arrival to evaluation and treatment.
Based on the results of the NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trial, which demonstrated both clinical effectiveness in reducing neurological deficits and disability and cost savings to health care systems, many community hospitals and managed-care organizations are exploring methods to enhance and expedite acute stroke care in their local communities. Only a small fraction of acute stroke victims is currently treated with thrombolytics (<1.5% nationally), and few benefit from the expertise and experience of the stroke teams. It is essential to develop new paradigms to improve acute stroke care in all settings, rural and urban. Rapid linkages to expert stroke care can help the underserved areas. Telemedicine for stroke, "Telestroke, " uses state-of-the-art video telecommunications that may be a potential solution and may maximize the number of patients given effective acute stroke treatment across the country and across the world. Telestroke could facilitate remote cerebrovascular specialty consults from virtually any location within minutes of attempted contact, adding greater expertise to the care of any individual patient. This model also has the potential to enhance patient entry into clinical trials. Telestroke would enhance stroke education through the use of Internet-based interactives for health-care professionals and patients. Education would be facilitated through the creation of telecommunication-linked classes providing interactive information on stroke care and prevention to places where they are otherwise not available. Health-care professionals will gain experience and expertise through the interaction with a remote expert--telementoring. Telestroke provides an excellent medium for data collection and an unprecedented opportunity for quality assurance. Monitoring of an entire tele-interaction can offer real-time assessments, which can then be analyzed in-depth at a later date for unique insights into health-care delivery. Prehospital use of telemedicine for stroke is already being piloted, linking patients in the ambulance to the emergency department. Legal and economic parameters must be established for telemedicine in the areas of reimbursement, liability, malpractice insurance, licensing, and credentialing. Issues of protection of privacy and confidentiality, informed consent, product liability, and industry standards must be addressed to facilitate the use of this new and potentially useful technology.
Computer-based technology can now be used to integrate electronic medical information, clinical assessment tools, neuroradiology, laboratory data, and clinical pathways to bring state-of-the-art expert stroke care to underserved areas.
The urinary proteome is a potential easily accessible source of biomarkers for inflammatory bladder diseases, including interstitial cystitis. In the present study, we subjected rat urine to multiplex cytokine analysis in an attempt to identify an inflammatory signature of the temporal course of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis.
Rat urine was collected for 12 hours after CYP injection (150 mg/kg) for multiplex analysis of 14 cytokines by a multiple antigen bead assay (Luminex 100 IS). Urine from each void was collected, and the voiding frequency was determined. The bladder tissue was analyzed for cytokines levels and histologic evidence of inflammation.
Significant changes were noted in the urine levels of all cytokines with respect to baseline at 2, 4, 6, and 10 hours after CYP injection. Elevation was noted at all times for most cytokines, except for monocyte chemotactic protein-1, which had a 5-fold decrease at 2 hours. The urine and tissue levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, and growth-related oncogene/keratinocyte-derived chemokine correlated significantly, with a positive Spearman correlation also noted for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1-1, IL-18, and interferon-gamma. The tissue levels for most cytokines, except for IL-2, and urinary frequency were significantly elevated in the CYP-treated rats compared with the control vehicle-treated rats. The hints of severe inflammation in the bladder indicated by the urinary cytokines were confirmed by bladder histologic examination and the tissue cytokine levels at necropsy.
The progression of CYP-induced cystitis was clearly reflected in the urine matrix by the temporal and quantitative changes in the cytokine levels. Additional delineation of urine and bladder tissue cytokine expression might yield biomarkers for cystitis.
Five patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) treated with lamotrigine (LTG) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of myoclonic jerks (MJ). In three patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose-dependent manner with early aggravation during titration. MJ disappeared when LTG dose was decreased by 25 to 50%. In two patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a delayed but more severe manner, with myoclonic status that only ceased after LTG withdrawal.
Lorazepam is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as the preferred agent for sedation of critically ill patients. Intravenous lorazepam contains propylene glycol, which has been associated with toxicity when high doses of lorazepam are administered.
To evaluate the accumulation of propylene glycol in critically ill patients receiving lorazepam by continuous infusion and determine factors associated with propylene glycol concentration.
A 6-month, retrospective, safety assessment was conducted of adults admitted to the medical intensive care unit who were receiving lorazepam by continuous infusion for 12 hours or more. Propylene glycol serum concentrations were obtained 24-48 hours after continuous-infusion lorazepam was initiated and every 3-5 days thereafter. Propylene glycol accumulation was defined as concentrations of 25 mg/dL or more. Groups with and without propylene glycol accumulation were compared and factors associated with propylene glycol concentration were determined using multivariate correlation regression analyses.
Forty-eight propylene glycol serum samples were obtained from 33 patients. Fourteen (42%) patients had propylene glycol accumulation, representing 23 (48%) serum samples. Univariate analyses showed the following factors were related to propylene glycol accumulation: baseline renal dysfunction, presence of alcohol withdrawal, sex, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, rate of lorazepam continuous infusion, and 24-hour lorazepam dose. Multivariate linear regression modeling demonstrated that propylene glycol concentration was strongly associated with the continuous infusion rate and 24-hour dose (adjusted r(2) > or = 0.77; p < 0.001). Independent correlation analyses showed that these 2 variables were so strongly associated with propylene glycol concentration (r(2) > or = 0.71; p < 0.001) that they alone predicted propylene glycol concentration. Seven (21%) patients developed renal dysfunction after continuous-infusion lorazepam was initiated, but associated causes were indeterminable. Other possible propylene glycol-associated adverse effects were not observed.
The continuous infusion rate and cumulative 24-hour lorazepam dose are strongly associated with and independently predict propylene glycol concentrations. Despite the absence of confirmed propylene glycol-associated adverse effects, clinicians should be aware that propylene glycol accumulation may occur with continuous-infusion lorazepam.
The aims of this study were to select the patients with a potential for progression to hepatic failure due to lamivudine-resistant HBV and to standardize the treatment for patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV. Patients (n = 47) with reactivated hepatitis due to lamivudine-resistant HBV were classified into two groups, with and without potential for progression to hepatic failure, according to the criteria using the data of serum bilirubin level and prothrombin activity after the reactivated hepatitis. Multivariate analysis showed that prothrombin activity at the initiation of lamivudine therapy was related to the deterioration of the liver function after the emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV (P = 0.0025, 95%CI 0.8269-0.9601). We assume that earlier additional or substitutive treatment with other antiviral agent, such as adefovir dipivoxil, should be recommended when the lamivudine-resistant HBV is detected in patients with the history of decompensated liver disease before the administration of lamivudine, even when hepatitis has not been reactivated yet.
The effects of oral nifedipine on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function were assessed in 14 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who had symptoms despite therapy with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and nitrates. Rest and exercise gated radionuclide ventriculography was performed before and a mean of 13 days after the addition of oral nifedipine (80 to 120 mg/day) to baseline medication. Ejection fraction did not increase in any patient during exercise. The addition of nifedipine slightly improved the LV ejection fraction response to exercise (control, 49 +/- 8% rest vs 44 +/- 9% exercise; nifedipine, 47 +/- 6% vs 48 +/- 8%). With nifedipine treatment, diastolic function improved, with a decrease in the time to peak filling rate (PFR) at rest (from 174 +/- 34 to 152 +/- 31 ms, p less than 0.005) and an increase in PFR with exercise (from 2.5 +/- 0.6 to 3.4 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume/s, p less than 0.0005). Using the ratio of PFR/peak ejection rate as a variable, preferential improvement of diastolic over systolic function occurred during exercise (1.03 +/- 0.29 baseline vs 1.4 +/- 0.43 with nifedipine, p less than 0.01). Duration of exercise increased by a mean of 21% with nifedipine (from 454 +/- 150 to 550 +/- 159 seconds, p less than 0.005); all 14 patients were limited by angina pectoris at baseline, whereas only 5 patients were limited by angina pectoris after nifedipine treatment. This study shows that global LV diastolic function is improved by oral nifedipine treatment both at rest and during exercise in patients on maximally tolerated doses of beta-adrenoreceptor blockers and nitrates, and is associated with improvement of symptoms and exercise tolerances.
A patient with ulcerative colitis developed skin allergy to sulfasalazine, manifested by rash urticaria and generalized angioedema. The patient underwent desensitization with the drug. After desensitization, the drug was reinstituted without any adverse skin reaction. However, 2 months later the patient developed a severe pneumonitis that resolved completely on discontinuation of sulfasalazine and administration of steroids. The relationship between the various adverse reactions to the drug is discussed and the entity "sulfasalazine pneumonitis" is reviewed.
Administration of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to grouped rats injected intraventricularly with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) produced violent fighting accompanied by remarkable hyperirritability. This behavior was induced reproducibly from the 10th to 100th postoperative days. It was shown that this irritable aggression could be measured continuously and quantitatively in terms of degree of activity and/or vocalization using a newly designed analyzer. The effect of THC differed markedly from the action of apomorphine and methamphetamine in 6-OHDA pretreated rats. Apomorphine induced irritable aggression but not vigorous vocalization. On the other hand, methamphetamine induced much less irritable aggression than apomorphine-induced aggression. It is assumed that a THC-invoked imbalance in catecholamine agonistic and serotonin antagonistic action brought about by activation of supersensitized catecholaminergic receptor was operating to produce the aggression. Specifically, hypoactivity of serotonergic neurons might play a key role in the occurrence of THC-induced irritable aggression.
1. Magnolol is an active component of Magnolia officinalis. It is 1000-times more potent than alpha-tocopherol in inhibiting lipid peroxidation in rat heart mitochondria. In the present study, the in vivo antiarrhythmic and anti-ischaemic effects of magnolol in coronary ligated rats were investigated. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized with urethane. Magnolol, at dosages of 10(-7), 10(-8) and 10(-9) g/kg, was administered intravenously 15 min before ligation of the coronary artery. 3. The incidence and duration of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during 30 min coronary ligation were significantly reduced by magnolol. Ventricular arrhythmias during 10 min reperfusion after the relief of coronary ligation were also reduced. 4. In rats subjected to 4 h coronary ligation, 10(-7) and 10(-8) g/kg magnolol significantly reduced infarct size. 5. We conclude that magnolol may protect the myocardium against ischaemic injury and suppress ventricular arrhythmia during ischaemia and reperfusion.
Cyclophosphamide (CPA) and ifosfamide (IFA) are widely used anticancer prodrugs that are bioactivated in the liver by specific cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). The therapeutic activity of these antitumor agents can be compromised by a low therapeutic index that is, in part, due to the systemic distribution of activated drug metabolites. Here, recombinant retroviruses were used to deliver six different CPA- or IFA-metabolizing human CYP genes to 9L gliosarcoma cells: 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18 (Met385 and Thr385 alleles), 2C19, and 3A4. Intratumoral cytochrome P450 expression conferred substantial sensitivity to CPA cytotoxicity, with the most dramatic effects seen with CYP2B6. Strong CPA chemosensitivity was also seen following transduction of CYP2C18-Met, despite a very low level of CYP protein expression (>60-fold lower than that of 2B6). In contrast to CPA, the cytotoxicity of IFA was greatest toward tumor cells transduced with CYP3A4, followed by CYPs 2B6 and 2C18-Met. A substantial further increase in chemosensitivity was achieved upon transduction of 2B6 or 2C18-Met-expressing tumor cells with P450 reductase, which provided for more efficient intratumoral prodrug activation and cytotoxicity at lower drug concentrations. With 2B6- plus P450 reductase-transduced tumor cells, CPA but not IFA conferred a strong cell contact-independent bystander cytotoxic effect on non-P450-expressing 9L cells. CPA treatment of tumors that were transduced with 2B6 or 2C18-Met together with P450 reductase and were grown s.c. in immunodeficient mice resulted in a large enhancement of the liver P450-dependent antitumor effect seen with control 9L tumors, with no apparent increase in host toxicity (growth delay of >25-50 days in P450-expressing tumors versus approximately 5-6 days without P450). CYP2B6 plus P450 reductase and CYP2C18-Met plus P450 reductase thus appear to be excellent gene combinations for use with CPA in P450/prodrug activation-based cancer gene therapy.
Administration of beta blockers decreases tachycardia during exercise. In this regard, the effects of cardioselective drugs are similar to those of noncardioselective drugs. Beta blockers with partial agonist activity, however, may produce a lesser decrease in tachycardia during exercise. Cardioselective beta blockers have significantly less effect than noncardioselective drugs on isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. This may result from 2 factors: the failure of cardioselective drugs to block a beta 2 receptor-mediated vasodilator reflex tachycardia and their failure to block cardiac chronotropic beta 2 receptors. Exercise increases plasma catecholamine concentrations and the increases are larger in the presence of beta blockers. Cardioselective beta blockers produce larger increases. There is evidence for attenuation of exercise conditioning by beta blockers and this effect is probably shared by cardioselective and noncardioselective drugs. Beta blockers produce regulatory increases in beta receptor density, and physical training may do the opposite. The interaction between these 2 processes remains to be defined.
The carcinogenic activities of anthraquinone and six derivatives were compared and contrasted. Studies included representatives of amino, alkyl, nitro, hydroxy, or halogen-containing anthraquinones, with the purpose of uncovering general structure-activity relationships. Anthraquinone, 2-aminoanthraquinone, 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone, 2-methyl-1-nitroanthraquinone,1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, 1,4,5,8-tetraaminoanthraquinone, and 1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone (of varying purities) were administered via feed to Fischer 344/N rats and B6C3F, mice. In rats, anthraquinone induced tumors in the liver, kidney, and urinary bladder. A 2-amino substitution narrowed the carcinogenicity to the liver, while multiple amino substitutions led to a carcinogenic response in the urinary bladder alone. A methyl substitution ortho to a 1-aminogroup preserved the hepatic and renal neoplasms seen with the parent anthraquinone, but did not induce urinary bladder tumors; amino or bromo substitutions para to a 1-amino group were related to urinary bladder neoplasms. The intestine may have been a target organ for bromine-substituted anthraquinones. The presence of a nitro group altered the targets of carcinogenicity, and skin tumors may have been associated with this particular functional group in both rats and mice. Over-all for mice, the findings were somewhat different and limited by the small number of common target organs. The parent anthraquinone was clearly carcinogenic only to the liver. There were no other effects of single amino substitutions, in the presence or absence of an additional methyl group, on the carcinogenicity or the site of carcinogenesis of anthraquinone in mice. Multiple amino substitutions diminished, while bromine substitutions enhanced the carcinogenicity induced by anthraquinone and extended the target organs to include forestomach and lung.
Antagonists of the mineralocorticoid receptor improve morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure. However, the cell types involved in these beneficial effects are only partially known. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether genetic deletion of mineralocorticoid receptors in mouse cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts in vivo is cardioprotective after chronic left ventricular pressure overload. After transverse aortic constriction, mice deficient in myocyte mineralocorticoid receptors but not those deficient in fibroblast mineralocorticoid receptors were protected from left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. After pressure overload, left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in mice lacking myocyte mineralocorticoid receptors (70.2±4.4%) as compared with control mice (54.3±2.5%; P<0.01). Myocyte mineralocorticoid receptor-deficient mice showed mild cardiac hypertrophy at baseline, contributing to reduced left ventricular wall tension at baseline and after pressure overload. Cardiac levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 were higher in myocyte mineralocorticoid receptor-deficient mice than in control mice after pressure overload. Neither fibroblast nor myocyte mineralocorticoid receptor ablation altered the development of cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis after pressure overload. Both mineralocorticoid receptor mutant mouse strains developed similar degrees of myocyte apoptosis, proinflammatory gene expression, and macrophage infiltration after pressure overload. Thus, mineralocorticoid receptors in cardiac myocytes but not in fibroblasts protect from cardiac dilatation and failure after chronic pressure overload.
A 47-year-old female was scheduled for ulnar osteotomy under general anesthesia combined with brachial plexus block. She had a history of symptomatic epilepsy due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Immediately after giving 100 mg bolus of propofol to the patient, she developed generalized convulsion similar to a grand mal. The seizure was suppressed by the administration of thiamylal. After that no further convulsive attack occurred. Although it has been known that propofol has anticonvulsive properties, there have been several reported cases of seizure following the administration of propofol. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of seizure induced by propofol in the patients with epilepsy.
A child had two to three generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures per week unresponsive to phenobarbital (PB) and valproate (VPA). Interictal EEG demonstrated left occipital spikes. When carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy was started, he developed very frequent (4-6/day) complex partial seizures (CPS) characterized on ictal EEG by focal right temporal lobe discharges. The seizure exacerbation, which was associated with development of nonepileptic, multifocal myoclonus, resolved 24 h after CBZ was discontinued. The exacerbation occurred with therapeutic CBZ serum levels, but may have been related to the toxic levels of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide (CBZE).
Our recent studies have shown that curcumin protects arsenic induced neurotoxicity by modulating oxidative stress, neurotransmitter levels and dopaminergic system in rats. As chronic exposure to arsenic has been associated with cognitive deficits in humans, the present study has been carried out to implore the neuroprotective potential of curcumin in arsenic induced cholinergic dysfunctions in rats. Rats treated with arsenic (sodium arsenite, 20mg/kg body weight, p.o., 28 days) exhibited a significant decrease in the learning activity, assessed by passive avoidance response associated with decreased binding of (3)H-QNB, known to label muscarinic-cholinergic receptors in hippocampus (54%) and frontal cortex (27%) as compared to controls. Decrease in the activity of acetylcholinesterase in hippocampus (46%) and frontal cortex (33%), staining of Nissl body, immunoreactivity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and expression of ChAT protein in hippocampal region was also observed in arsenic treated rats as compared to controls. Simultaneous treatment with arsenic and curcumin (100mg/kg body weight, p.o., 28 days) increased learning and memory performance associated with increased binding of (3)H-QNB in hippocampus (54%), frontal cortex (25%) and activity of acetylcholinesterase in hippocampus (41%) and frontal cortex (29%) as compared to arsenic treated rats. Increase in the expression of ChAT protein, immunoreactivity of ChAT and staining of Nissl body in hippocampal region was also observed in rats simultaneously treated with arsenic and curcumin as compared to those treated with arsenic alone. The results of the present study suggest that curcumin significantly modulates arsenic induced cholinergic dysfunctions in brain and also exhibits neuroprotective efficacy of curcumin.
Patients with decompensated hepatitis B virus (HBV) cirrhosis have a poor prognosis due to the development of progressive liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Lamivudine appears to be a safe and effective antiviral agent, which may improve or stabilize liver disease in selected patients with advanced cirrhosis and active HBV replication. However, viral resistance can develop with prolonged treatment and some patients with advanced cirrhosis may not experience any discernible benefit. The use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis with or without lamivudine has resulted in excellent survival and a low rate of graft reinfection in patients who undergo liver transplantation for decompensated HBV cirrhosis. Adefovir and entecavir are newer antiviral agents that have activity against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV. Additional studies of individual or combination antiviral agents are urgently needed to improve further the prospects for the large number of patients worldwide with decompensated HBV cirrhosis.
