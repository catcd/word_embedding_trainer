We have recently shown that treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine may aggravate albuminuria and glomerular injury in rats with two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension if arterial blood pressure is not reduced. To test whether nitrendipine also exerts its adverse renal effects when normotension is achieved, we examined the effect of combined therapy with nitrendipine and the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney. Rats treated with enalapril alone or in combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide or rats treated with nitrendipine alone served as controls. Therapy was started 6 weeks after clipping of one renal artery. Nitrendipine alone did not reduce blood pressure but significantly increased albuminuria, diuresis, glomerular filtration rate, and glomerular volume and injury compared with untreated hypertensive controls. Increase of glomerular filtration rate, diuresis, and albuminuria was reversible after withdrawal of nitrendipine. Treatment with enalapril alone decreased blood pressure significantly but not to normotensive levels and was without significant effect on albuminuria and glomerular morphology. The combination of nitrendipine and enalapril reduced blood pressure to normotensive levels and not only prevented the increase of glomerular volume, glomerular filtration rate, diuresis, and albuminuria caused by nitrendipine alone but furthermore improved glomerular injury and albuminuria to levels not significantly different from normotensive controls. Enalapril in combination with the diuretic had similar beneficial effects on blood pressure, albuminuria, and glomerular injury. These data demonstrate that the adverse effects of nitrendipine monotherapy on glomerular structure and function can be prevented by the combination of nitrendipine and enalapril when blood pressure is normalized.
Survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus has increased with corticosteroid therapy. However, adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy on cardiovascular structures, such as scarring and shrinking of affected valves, are not well known. We report the case of a 19-year-old patient who developed severe mitral insufficiency within a few weeks after high-dosage corticosteroid therapy had been instituted for an acute relapse of systemic lupus erythematosus. The rapid development of severe mitral regurgitation was documented by sequential colour Doppler echocardiography.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects 3%-5% of typical school-age children. However, considerably higher rates of ADHD (15%-25%) are observed in children with intellectual disability and autism. Studies of psychostimulants in the latter two populations have found poorer response rates compared to typically developing children. In addition, evidence suggests that children with developmental disabilities experience higher rates of adverse events. Guanfacine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has shown some promise as an alternative to psychostimulants.
The present study involved a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of guanfacine in 11 children (ages 5-9 years) with developmental disabilities and symptoms of inattention/overactivity. The 6-week trial involved a maximum dose of 3 mg/day of guanfacine.
Significant benefits were observed on the Hyperactivity subscale of the parent and teacher Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Global Improvement Ratings. No gains were noted on other ABC subscales. Five of the 11 subjects (45%) were judged to be responders based on a 50% decrease in the ABC Hyperactivity subscale score between the placebo and guanfacine conditions. Several side effects were reported, including drowsiness and irritability.
While guanfacine appears to be an alternative to psychostimulants among children with developmental disabilities, clinicians need to remain vigilant to the possibility of side effects.
The newer fluoroquinolones have many properties such as safety, bioavailability, and tissue penetration that make them attractive in the therapy of complicated infections. Unfortunately, the rapid development of resistance by Staphylococcus aureus to ciprofloxacin has dampened interest in these agents for serious staphylococcal infections. A patient with right-sided methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis with a complicated clinical course received trovafloxacin in addition to vancomycin and rifampin. He was initially treated with vancomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin for serious MRSA infection, but because of complications, including septic central nervous system emboli, persistent fever, and leukocytosis, gentamicin was stopped and trovafloxacin begun. After this addition the patient improved and completely recovered. In vitro and animal model data show that many newer fluoroquinolones have excellent activity against S. aureus, including MRSA, and are also less likely to induce resistance. Animal models of endocarditis support their efficacy in serious staphylococcal infections.
In previous studies, maternal exposure to folic acid antagonists was associated with increased risks of neural tube defects, cardiovascular defects, oral clefts and urinary tract defects. The objective of the current study was to assess the possible effects of using folic acid antagonists in pregnancy on placenta-mediated adverse outcomes of pregnancy.
We used data from an administrative database to retrospectively compare the occurrence of placenta-mediated adverse pregnancy outcomes between pregnant women exposed to folic acid antagonists and women without exposure to these agents.
We included in the analysis a total of 14 982 women who had been exposed to folic acid antagonists and 59 825 women who had not been exposed. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was the most frequently prescribed dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor (a total of 12 546 exposures during the preconception period and all 3 trimesters), and phenobarbital was the most frequently prescribed among the other folic acid antagonists (a total of 1565 exposures). The risks of preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-1.66), severe preeclampsia (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.38-2.28), placental abruption (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12-1.57), fetal growth restriction defined as less than the 10th percentile (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13), fetal growth restriction defined as less than the 3rd percentile (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11-1.34) and fetal death (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07-1.70) were greater among mothers with exposure to folic acid antagonists. In general, the risks associated with exposure to other folic acid antagonists were higher than those associated with exposure to dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors. Supplementary analyses involving tight matching with propensity score, restriction of the analysis to women with exposure during the first and second trimesters and restriction of the analysis to specific categories of folic acid antagonists yielded similar results.
Maternal exposure to folic acid antagonists appears to increase the risk of placenta-mediated adverse outcomes of pregnancy.
This report investigates the pathomechanism of acute renal failure caused by toxic acute tubular necrosis after treatment with the antiretroviral agent adefovir. A 38-year-old white homosexual man with human immunodeficiency virus infection and no history of opportunistic infections was maintained on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), including hydroxyurea, stavudine, indinavir, ritonavir, and adefovir dipivoxil. Histologic examination of the renal biopsy showed severe acute tubular degenerative changes primarily affecting the proximal tubules. On ultrastructural examination, proximal tubular mitochondria were extremely enlarged and dysmorphic with loss and disorientation of their cristae. Functional histochemical stains for mitochondrial enzymes revealed focal tubular deficiency of cytochrome C oxidase (COX), a respiratory chain enzyme partially encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), with preservation of succinate dehydrogenase, a respiratory chain enzyme entirely encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Immunoreactivity for COX subunit I (encoded by mtDNA) was weak to undetectable in most tubular epithelial cells, although immunoreactivities for COX subunit IV and iron sulfur subunit of respiratory complex III (both encoded by nDNA) were well preserved in all renal tubular cells. Single-renal tubule polymerase chain reaction revealed marked reduction of mtDNA in COX-immunodeficient renal tubules. We conclude that adefovir-induced nephrotoxicity is mediated by depletion of mtDNA from proximal tubular cells through inhibition of mtDNA replication. This novel form of nephrotoxicity may serve as a prototype for other forms of renal toxicity caused by reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
This prospective pilot study has been carried out to assess the effect of high parenteral doses of estrogens and progestogens on lumbar spine bone density in osteopenic women. Thirteen osteopenic women received 40 mg estradiol valerate and 250 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate by intramuscular injections once a week for 6 months (so called "pseudopregnancy"). One g oral calcium was added. Six out of the 13 patients (49.5 +/- 4.8 y were peri- and postmenopausal = group A. Seven patients (21.5 +/- 2.2 y) suffered from primary and secondary amenorrhea, in 4 out of them due to gonadal dysgenesis = group B. Estradiol was measured by commercial radioimmunoassay. Bone density was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the upper 4 lumbar vertebrae. Lumbar spine bone density as well as estradiol serum levels were measured before and 3 and 6 months after therapy, respectively. Estradiol increased from 34.8 +/- 7.5 pg/ml to 3226 +/- 393 pg/ml after 3 months and to 2552 +/- 254 pg/ml after 6 months, respectively, in group A. Bone density increased by 15.3 +/- 3.6% within the first 3 months to a total of 18.8 +/- 3.9% after 6 months, respectively. Two patients we have controlled for two years, maintained this increase. In group B estradiol increased from 27.8 +/- 6.5 pg/ml to 3028 +/- 728 after 3 and to 2491 +/- 684 pg/ml after 6 months. Bone density in this group increased by 11.8 +/- 1.9% within 3 and to a total of 18.2 +/- 2.8% after 6 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Effects of ranolazine on isosorbide dinitrate- and on sildenafil-induced changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate were assessed in conscious dogs. Dogs (n = 7) were chronically instrumented for measurements of mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Bolus intravenous injections of either isosorbide dinitrate (0.2 mg/kg) or sildenafil (0.5 mg/kg) caused biphasic changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate: a transient (approximately 20 s) decrease in mean arterial pressure and an increase in heart rate, followed by prolonged (10-15 min) decreases in mean arterial pressure by 11 +/- 1.6 and 11 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, respectively. Infusion of ranolazine alone (plasma concentrations = 4 or 8 microM) for 10 min did not significantly affect mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The transient hypotension and tachycardia caused by isosorbide dinitrate were not altered by ranolazine. The sildenafil-induced transient tachycardia (Delta change: 114 +/- 10 beats/min) was significantly (P < 0.05) blunted by either 4 (Delta change: 71 +/- 8 beats/min) or 8 (Delta change: 66 +/- 9 beats/min) microM ranolazine. However, the sildenafil-induced transient decrease in mean arterial pressure was not altered by ranolazine. During ranolazine infusion (4-5 or 8-10 microM), isosorbide dinitrate and sildenafil caused prolonged decreases in mean arterial pressure. These results indicate that except for a blunting of the transient tachycardia caused by sildenafil, ranolazine at concentrations up to 10 microM does not alter changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate induced by either isosorbide dinitrate or sildenafil in conscious dogs.
Flavonoids have been demonstrated to exert health benefits in humans. We investigated whether the flavonoid baicalein would inhibit the adhesion, migration, invasion, and growth of human hepatoma cell lines, and we also investigated its mechanism of action. The separate effects of baicalein and baicalin on the viability of HA22T/VGH and SK-Hep1 cells were investigated for 24h. To evaluate their invasive properties, cells were incubated on matrigel-coated transwell membranes in the presence or absence of baicalein. We examined the effect of baicalein on the adhesion of cells, on the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), protein kinase C (PKC), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and on tumor growth in vivo. We observed that baicalein suppresses hepatoma cell growth by 55%, baicalein-treated cells showed lower levels of migration than untreated cells, and cell invasion was significantly reduced to 28%. Incubation of hepatoma cells with baicalein also significantly inhibited cell adhesion to matrigel, collagen I, and gelatin-coated substrate. Baicalein also decreased the gelatinolytic activities of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA, decreased p50 and p65 nuclear translocation, and decreased phosphorylated I-kappa-B (IKB)-β. In addition, baicalein reduced the phosphorylation levels of PKCα and p38 proteins, which regulate invasion in poorly differentiated hepatoma cells. Finally, when SK-Hep1 cells were grown as xenografts in nude mice, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of baicalein induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in tumor growth. These results demonstrate the anticancer properties of baicalein, which include the inhibition of adhesion, invasion, migration, and proliferation of human hepatoma cells in vivo.
The effect of amantadine on various models of aggressiveness was investigated in experiments on male albino rats and mice. Amantadine (30-75 mg/kg) inhibited emotional reactivity and aggressiveness in models of shock- and apomorphine-induced aggression reproduced in rats. The drug also inhibited the isolation-induced aggressiveness in mice. In rats with bilaterally damaged caudate nucleus no inhibitory effect of amantadine on emotional behavior was in evidence, while in those with destroyed midbrain raphe nuclei this effect of amantadine was less ostensible by comparison with controls (sham-operated animals). It is suggested that the antiaggressive effect of amantadine is due to its stimulating action on the strial serotoninergic system.
To review post-anaesthetic hepatitis in a South African population, given that halothane use is restricted in other countries because of the high mortality and morbidity of its associated type II (idiosyncratic) hepatitis, even though it is still widely used in South Africa.
Descriptive, retrospective analysis.
Hepatitis cases that occurred after inhalational anaesthetic use were identified by means of a computer search of Groote Schuur Hospital records, 1980-1994. Cases of hepatitis caused by circulatory failure and viral hepatitis were excluded.
Twenty-six episodes occurred in 22 patients (mean age 49.05 years, range 32-65 years), of whom 15 were women. This gave an estimated incidence of 3.53/100,000 anaesthetics (95% confidence interval 2.06-5.0/100,000). All had pyrexia (mean 38.7 +/- 0.72 degrees C), malaise, anorexia or nausea and vomiting, with onset a mean of 4.27 +/- 3.5 days after exposure. Jaundice occurred in 86%, rash in 13.6%; 17 patients (77%) were obese. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels were raised 47.49 +/- 61.8 and 55.9 +/- 54.5 times the upper limit of normal. Seven patients died and 1 underwent liver transplantation. Hepatitis occurred after the first exposure in only 2 patients (9%). Men and women had a similar risk, but the estimated relative risk for whites v. black or coloured patients was 3.33 (95% confidence interval 1.45-7.23; P = 0.003) controlling for gender. Awareness of the condition was suboptimal, and in 3 patients re-exposure to halothane occurred after an initial episode of typical halothane hepatitis.
Halothane hepatitis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa. It is more common in whites, but there was no gender-related excess risk.
Many patients with temporal lobe epilepsy display neuron loss in the dentate gyrus. One potential epileptogenic mechanism is loss of GABAergic interneurons and inhibitory synapses with granule cells. Stereological techniques were used to estimate numbers of gephyrin-positive punctae in the dentate gyrus, which were reduced short-term (5 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus) but later rebounded beyond controls in epileptic rats. Stereological techniques were used to estimate numbers of synapses in electron micrographs of serial sections processed for postembedding GABA-immunoreactivity. Adjacent sections were used to estimate numbers of granule cells and glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons per dentate gyrus. GABAergic neurons were reduced to 70% of control levels short-term, where they remained in epileptic rats. Integrating synapse and cell counts yielded average numbers of GABAergic synapses per granule cell, which decreased short-term and rebounded in epileptic animals beyond control levels. Axo-shaft and axo-spinous GABAergic synapse numbers in the outer molecular layer changed most. These findings suggest interneuron loss initially reduces numbers of GABAergic synapses with granule cells, but later, synaptogenesis by surviving interneurons overshoots control levels. In contrast, the average number of excitatory synapses per granule cell decreased short-term but recovered only toward control levels, although in epileptic rats excitatory synapses in the inner molecular layer were larger than in controls. These findings reveal a relative excess of GABAergic synapses and suggest that reports of reduced functional inhibitory synaptic input to granule cells in epilepsy might be attributable not to fewer but instead to abundant but dysfunctional GABAergic synapses.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, thalidomide or placebo together with glucocorticoids and either cyclosporine or tacrolimus was administered as initial therapy for clinical extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). All patients had thrombocytopenia or cGVHD that evolved directly from acute GVHD as an indicator of a poor prognosis. The study drug (thalidomide or placebo) was administered initially at a dose of 200 mg orally per day, followed by a gradual increase to 800 mg/d if side effects were tolerable. Treatment with the study drug was discontinued before resolution of cGVHD in 23 (92%) of the 25 patients who received thalidomide and in 17 (65%) of the 26 patients who received placebo (P =.02). Neutropenia and neurologic symptoms were the most frequent reasons for early discontinuation of treatment with thalidomide. The duration of treatment with thalidomide was too short to assess its efficacy in controlling cGVHD. (Blood. 2000;96:3995-3996)
The nephrotoxic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognized. Known potentiating risk factors include pre-existing renal disease, intravascular volume depletion, and concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs. We present a case report of renal failure following short term usage of intramuscular ketorolac (Toradol) in a patient with no known risk factors who underwent an uncomplicated laparotomy. The literature concerning ketorolac-induced renal failure is reviewed and physicians are reminded to be aware of this potential complication.
Damage to the exocrine pancreas has been observed in patients and animals with hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. Bezafibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha activator, has been shown to improve lipid and glucose metabolism, and to interfere with the inflammatory response.
To examine the effects of bezafibrate on exocrine pancreas in hyperlipidemic obese and diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats that have no cholecystokinin-1 receptor gene expression.
One group of rats (n = 8) received a bezafibrate-rich diet (150 mg/100 g normal chow) from 12 weeks of age until 30 weeks of age, whereas a control group (n = 8) received standard rat chow.
Bezafibrate treatment significantly reduced serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fatty acids levels and significantly increased the pancreatic wet weight (1,145 +/- 54 vs 874 +/- 33 mg/rat, p < 0.01), and protein (169 +/- 7 vs 128 +/- 11 mg/pancreas p < 0.01) and enzyme contents in the pancreas compared with those in untreated control rats. Immunohistochemical studies of the pancreas showed that expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6, and alpha-smooth muscle actin in bezafibrate-treated rats was greatly suppressed compared with that in the untreated control rats. The histopathologic changes such as vacuolar degeneration and tubular complexes observed in the control rat pancreas were markedly improved in bezafibrate-treated rats.
Our results suggest that bezafibrate reduces hyperlipidemia, inhibits pancreatic inflammation, and prevents pancreatic degeneration in obese and diabetic OLETF rats.
Tumourous diseases can damage the kidneys by different mechanisms, e.g. by infiltration of the kidneys, by obstruction of the urinary pathways or the syndrome of acute tumour lysis after aggressive cytostatic treatment. Moreover, there may be be even direct renal damage caused by cytostatic treatment. Serious nephrotoxicity with development of acute renal failure, Mg depletion and possibly chronic renal failure may be caused in particular by cisplatinum and less by its more recent derivatives. Nephrotoxicity of cisplatinum derivatives can be effectively mitigated by hydratation regimens and the administration of hypertonic NaCl. More recent findings on the nephrotoxicity of cisplatinum will certainly make possible the development of less toxic derivatives as well as more effective prevention and treatment of cisplatinum nephrotoxicity. Large-dose vaginous with iphosphamide may cause in addition to urotoxicity, common in all oxazaposphorins, the development of renal insufficiency and serious forms of acquired Fanconi's syndrome. The uro- and nephrotoxicity of iphosphamide can be reduced, but not entirely eliminated by administration of mesna. Large doses of metothrexate can precipitate in the tubules and induce acute renal failure. The nephrotoxicity of metothrexate can be prevented by alkalinisation and hydration regimes. Less common are other forms of nephrotoxicity e.g. tubulointerstitial nephritis induced by derivatives of hydroxyurea or the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome in conjunction with treatment with mitomycin C.
Oxidative stress plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Bcl-2 gene has close connection with antioxidant stress destruction in many diseases including diabetes. Carvedilol, an adrenoceptor blocker, also has antioxidant properties. To study the effect of carvedilol on the antioxidant status in diabetic hearts, we investigated carvedilol-administrated healthy and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. After small and large dosage carvedilol-administered for 5 weeks, hemodynamic parameters, the levels of malondialdehyde, activities of antioxidant enzymes and expression of Bcl-2 mRNA in the cardiac tissues were measured. The diabetic rats not only had cardiac disfunction, weaker activities of antioxidant enzymes, but also showed lower expression of Bcl-2. Carvedilol treatment increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and expression of Bcl-2 in healthy rats as well as diabetic rats. These results indicated that carvedilol partly improves cardiac function via its antioxidant properties in diabetic rats.
Population B, drug-resistant small strongyles have been studied in naturally infected horses in Kentucky for more than 40 years. These parasites first were found to be resistant to phenothiazine (PTZ) and thiabendazole (TBZ), later to other parasiticides. Studies have been on evaluation of antiparasitic efficacy of several compounds, especially the benzimidazoles, against Population B small strongyles in clinical (field) tests (1959-1983) on the commercial farm of origin and in clinical and critical tests (1966-2001) at the University of Kentucky (UK) research farm. Research on these nematodes through 1990 has been published. The current paper presents data on efficacies of various anthelmintics (mostly TBZ) against these and other internal parasites in critical tests done between 1991 and 2001. These were the last critical tests in the UK horses; the entire herd was terminated in 2005. Population B small strongyles were established in horses on a pasture at the UK research farm on Old Lot 4 in 1966, and a satellite of this group was relocated to Field 24 in 1987. The last treatment of any of the horses in clinical tests on pasture was 22 years for Old Lot 4 (mostly benzimidazoles) and 5 years for Field 24 (TBZ) before the last critical test in 2001. Antiparasitic compounds (all paste formulations) administered orally in critical tests (n = 36) reported in this paper were TBZ (@ 44 mg/kg), pyrantel pamoate (PRT @ 6.6 mg base/kg), PTZ (@ 55 mg/kg), fenbendazole (FBZ @ 5 mg/kg), oxfendazole (OFZ @ 10 mg/kg), and oxibendazole (OBZ @ 10 mg/kg). The drug given and number of horses treated from Old Lot 4 were TBZ (18), PRT (3), PTZ (2), FBZ (2), OFZ (1), and OBZ (1) and from Field 24 were OFZ (1) and TBZ (8). Removal of small strongyles in Old Lot 4 was excellent for PRT, OFZ, and OBZ but much less for TBZ, PTZ, and FBZ. For the 16 species present in this lot, removal by TBZ was lowest for seven species (Coronocyclus (Cor.) coronatus, Cyathostomum (Cya.) catinatum, Cylicocyclus (Cyc.) nassatus, Cylicostephanus (Cys.) calicatus, Cylicostephanus goldi, Cylicostephanus longibursatus, and Cylicostephanus minutus). Of these seven species, lowest activity was found for five by PTZ and FBZ. One of the five resistant species was different for each of these two drugs. In Field 24, efficacy against small strongyles was excellent for the one foal treated with OFZ early (1992) in the study. TBZ initially had higher activity than in later years. Of the 12 small strongyle species present in this field, TBZ activity throughout the study was, in general, low for Cor. coronatus, Cys. goldi, and Cys. longibursatus, but it declined more or less progressively for Cya. catinatum, Cylicocyclus leptostomus, Cyc. nassatus, and Cys. calicatus over the study period. Cys. minutus were not present in high enough numbers to evaluate drug efficacy. Overall activity of TBZ on the group of small strongyles did not change; that is, susceptibility did not increase over time in Old Lot 4 where these parasites were not exposed to a benzimidazole for many years. However, in Field 24, where additional TBZ pressure was put on these parasites, efficacy not only did not increase but it decreased. From the data for small strongyles in the two groups of foals, eight species were considered benzimidazole resistant in varying degrees (most research on TBZ). Data on prevalence and drug activity on other internal parasite species besides small strongyles also are given.
Genetic heterogeneity in Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is highlighted by patients showing clinical and cellular features of NBS but with no mutations in NBS1 and normal levels of nibrin. NBS is an autosomal recessive disorder, whose clinical cellular signs include growth and developmental defects, dysmorphic facies, immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, chromosomal instability and radiosensitivity. NBS is caused by mutations in the NBS1 gene, whose product is part of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex involved in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response pathway. Since the identification of the NBS1 gene, patients with NBS clinical signs, particularly severe congenital microcephaly, are screened for mutations in the NBS1 gene. Further analyses include X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations, telomere analysis, kinetics of DSBs repair, levels of a panel of proteins involved in the maintenance of genetic stability, radiation-induced phosphorylation of various substrates and cell cycle analysis. We describe a patient with a NBS clinical phenotype, chromosomal sensitivity to X-rays but without mutations in the whole NBS1 or in the Cernunnos gene. Enhanced response to irradiation was mediated neither by DSBs rejoining defects nor by the NBS/AT-dependent DNA-damage response pathway. Notably, we found that primary fibroblasts from this patient displayed telomere length alterations. Cross-talk between pathways controlling response to DSBs and those involved in maintaining telomeres has been shown in the present patient. Dissecting the cellular phenotype of radiosensitive NBS-like patients represents a useful tool for the research of new genes involved in the cellular response to DSBs.
Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolizing enzymes and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been shown to regulate the growth of epithelial cells. We have previously reported that exposure to the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein-directed inhibitor MK886 but not the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, reduced growth, increased apoptosis, and up-regulated PPARalpha and gamma expression in breast cancer cell lines. In the present study, we explore approaches to maximizing the proapoptotic effects of PPARgamma on lung cancer cell lines. Non-small-cell cancer cell line A549 revealed dose-dependent PPARgamma reporter activity after treatment with MK886. The addition of indomethacin in combination with MK886 further increases reporter activity. We also show increased growth inhibition and up-regulation of apoptosis after exposure to MK886 alone, or in combination with indomethacin and the PPAR ligand, 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 compared with single drug exposures on the adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and small-cell cancer cell lines H345, N417, and H510. Real-time PCR analyses showed increased PPAR mRNA and retinoid X receptor (RXR)alpha mRNA expression after exposure to MK886 and indomethacin in a time-dependent fashion. The results suggest that the principal proapoptotic effect of these drugs may be mediated through the known antiproliferative effects of the PPARgamma-RXR interaction. We therefore explored a three-drug approach to attempt to maximize this effect. The combination of low-dose MK886, ciglitazone, and 13-cis-retinoic acid interacted at least in a superadditive fashion to inhibit the growth of lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299, suggesting that targeting PPARgamma and AA action is a promising approach to lung cancer growth with a favorable therapeutic index.
Serious neurological disorders reported following whole-cell pertussis in comparison to acellular pertussis vaccines were evaluated. The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) was analyzed for Emergency Department (ED) visits, life-threatening reactions, hospitalizations, disabilities, deaths, seizures, infantile spasms, encephalitis/encephalopathy, autism, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and speech disorders reported with an initial onset of symptoms within 3 days following whole-cell pertussis and acellular pertussis vaccines among those residing in the US from 1997 to 1999. Controls were employed to evaluate potential biases in VAERS. Evaluations as to whether whole-cell and acellular vaccines were administered to populations of similar age and sex were undertaken because these factors might influence the study's results. Statistical increases were observed for all events examined following whole-cell pertussis vaccination in comparison to acellular pertussis vaccination, excepting cerebellar ataxia. Reporting biases were minimal in VAERS, and whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccines were administered to populations of similar age and sex. Biologic mechanisms for the increased reactogenicity of whole-cell pertussis vaccines may stem from the fact that whole-cell pertussis vaccines contain 3,000 different proteins, whereas DTaP contains two to five proteins. Whole-cell pertussis vaccine contains known neurotoxins including: endotoxin, pertussis toxin and adenylate cyclase. Our results, and conclusions by the US Institute of Medicine, suggest an association between serious neurological disorders and whole-cell pertussis immunization. In light of the presence of a safer and at least equally efficacious acellular pertussis vaccine alternative, the Japanese and US switch to using acellular pertussis vaccine seems well justified. Other countries using whole-cell pertussis-containing vaccines should consider following suite in the near future.
We report a rare case of a 41-year-old male patient, a professional musician, with dilated cardiomyopathy and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was refractory to class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Severe myolysis developed after 10 months' administration of amiodarone (400 mg/day) in combination with mexiletine (300 mg/day) and disopyramide (400 mg/day). He had been suffering from severe moving muscle pain and an extremely high (16,830) IU/ml) serum level of creatine kinase (CK). The dosage of amiodarone was reduced from 400 mg/day to 200 mg/day without reduction of mexiletine or disopyramide and the patient's symptoms diminished. However, sustained VT developed, and so the dosage of the drug was increased to 250 mg/day. The high serum level of CK also decreased and returned to the normal range after the reduction in amiodarone dosage. Electrophysiologic examination of moving muscle revealed normal motor and sensory conduction velocities and, furthermore, the electromyogram revealed normal potentials and normal motor units. We conclude that severe myolysis developed as a result of the high dose and chronic administration of amiodarone. This is the first report of a Japanese patient showing rare and serious adverse effects in response to amiodarone treatment.
