Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and estrogens appear to promote development of estrogen-dependent cancers, including breast and ovarian carcinomas. In this study, we evaluated the cell viability effect of BPA on BG-1 human ovarian cancer cells, along with the growth inhibitory effect of resveratrol (trans-3,4,5-trihydroxystilbene; RES), a naturally occurring phytoestrogen. In addition, we investigated the underlying mechanism(s) of BPA and RES in regulating the interaction between estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signals, a non- genomic pathway induced by 17β-estradiol (E2). BPA induced a significant increase in BG-1 cell growth and up-regulated mRNA levels of ERα and IGF-1R. In parallel with its mRNA level, the protein expression of ERα was induced, and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS-1), phosphorylated Akt1/2/3, and cyclin D1 were increased by BPA or E2. However, RES effectively reversed the BG-1 cell proliferation induced by E2 or BPA by inversely down-regulating the expressions of ERα, IGF-1R, p-IRS-1, and p-Akt1/2/3, and cyclin D1 at both transcriptional and translational levels. Taken together, these results suggest that RES is a novel candidate for prevention of tumor progression caused by EDCs, including BPA via effective inhibition of the cross-talk of ERα and IGF-1R signaling pathways.
There have been mixed findings regarding the prognostic significance of age of onset, executive dysfunction, and hyperintensity burden on treatment outcome in late-life depression.
Growth curve models were fit to data from the only 8-week, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of citalopram (20-40 mg/day) in patients aged 75 years and older with unipolar depression. Baseline assessment included Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (to determine age at onset), Stroop Color-Word Test (to assess the response inhibition component of execution dysfunction), and structural magnetic resonance imaging (to determine hyperintensity burden).
In the citalopram condition, patients with response inhibition (most impaired quartile) scored higher at endpoint than those without response inhibition. There were no effects for age of onset or hyperintensity load on response in the citalopram condition. In the placebo condition, patients with early-onset depression had higher depression scores at endpoint than patients with late-onset depression.
Only response inhibition, a fundamental executive function, predicted poor treatment response to antidepressant medication. Although patients with response inhibition also showed deficits in reaction time, adjusting for reaction time in our final response inhibition model did not substantively change the findings.
In June 2008, burning peat deposits produced haze and air pollution far in excess of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, encroaching on rural communities of eastern North Carolina. Although the association of mortality and morbidity with exposure to urban air pollution is well established, the health effects associated with exposure to wildfire emissions are less well understood.
We investigated the effects of exposure on cardiorespiratory outcomes in the population affected by the fire.
We performed a population-based study using emergency department (ED) visits reported through the syndromic surveillance program NC DETECT (North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool). We used aerosol optical depth measured by a satellite to determine a high-exposure window and distinguish counties most impacted by the dense smoke plume from surrounding referent counties. Poisson log-linear regression with a 5-day distributed lag was used to estimate changes in the cumulative relative risk (RR).
In the exposed counties, significant increases in cumulative RR for asthma [1.65 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.1)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1.73 (1.06-2.83)], and pneumonia and acute bronchitis [1.59 (1.07-2.34)] were observed. ED visits associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms [1.23 (1.06-1.43)] and heart failure [1.37 (1.01-1.85)] were also significantly increased.
Satellite data and syndromic surveillance were combined to assess the health impacts of wildfire smoke in rural counties with sparse air-quality monitoring. This is the first study to demonstrate both respiratory and cardiac effects after brief exposure to peat wildfire smoke.
Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) is an uncommon finding characterized by a sudden decrease in hemoglobin after treatment with the putative drug. The full range of drugs causing DIIHA and the initial serologic presentation are not fully appreciated. This work identifies additional drugs associated with DIIHA and offers additional insights about diagnosis.
A 20-year retrospective review of testing in one laboratory was performed. Patient sex, age, medication history, initial direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and indirect antiglobulin test, method of drug-dependent antibody (DDA) detection, and specificity were reviewed.
Seventy-one patients with 73 DDAs to 23 different drugs were identified. The following DDA specificities were identified: cephalosporins (37), penicillin and/or penicillin derivatives (12), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (11), quinine and/or quinidine (7), and others (6). Fifty-two percent (37) were due to cephalosporins with 27 cefotetan-dependent antibodies detected. Four NSAIDs required urinary metabolite for detection. DAT was strongly positive, at least 2+, in 75 percent (51/68) of patients with a positive DAT. Initial eluate was negative in 52 patients, weak positive (<2+) in 14 patients, and strong positive (>or=2+) in 2 patients. Serologic results showed characteristics of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in 22 or 31 percent of all cases and cold-reactive AIHA in 2 cases.
It is important to consider DIIHA when a patient serologically presents as either warm- or cold-type AIHA to avoid erroneous diagnosis. Based on these findings, the strength of the initial DAT is much stronger than previously reported for all types of drug-induced immune hemolysis. This report is also unique in the number of NSAIDs reported. A new classification of categorizing DDA is proposed.
Cresols are monomethyl derivatives of phenol frequently used as solvents and intermediates in the production of disinfectants, fragrances, pesticides, dyes, and explosives, which is probably why they are widely distributed in the environment. General population may be exposed to cresols mainly through inhalation of contaminated air. In this study we evaluated the toxicological effects of o-cresol on differential gene expression profile of rat liver and prostate. Experiments were conducted on 80 male rats, 60 of which were exposed to o-cresol (1.5 g kg-1, 5 g kg-1, or 15 g kg-1) through feed for 8 weeks. Three groups of rats were supplemented with 0.1 mg kg-1 selenium (Se, in the form of, sodium selenite) in addition to o-cresol to evaluate its effectiveness against o-cresol toxicity. Control group received neither o-cresol nor Se, while one group received Se alone. Survival was similar between the exposed and control animals. Rats exposed to 15 g kg-1 of o-cresol showed a 16 % loss in body weight by the end of the study, which may have been related to o-cresol making feed unpalatable at this concentration. Liver and prostate tissue samples were collected at the end of the treatment. mRNA analysis revealed that apoptotic genes (CYP3A, COX-2, PPARγ, BAX, BCL2, AKT-1, and PKCα) related to cancer were up-regulated in liver and prostate tissues isolated from groups exposed to 5 g kg-1 and 15 g kg-1o-cresol in comparison to control. Changes in gene expression profile were prevented when rats were supplemented with Se. The exact mechanisms underlying its protective effect remain to be clarified by future studies.
Risperidone has proven efficacy with reduced likelihood of causing extrapyramidal symptoms in the treatment of schizophrenia. Initial work suggests its utility in the management of aggression and self injury in patients with mental retardation. The use of risperidone in eight adult patients with moderate to profound mental retardation is described. Risperidone in these individuals was associated with significant reduction in aggression and self injurious behavior. Side effects were primarily those of sedation and restlessness. These cases illustrate the possible utility of risperidone in the treatment of aggression and self injury in adult patients with moderate to profound mental retardation.
Aluminum (Al) is considered to be a potentially toxic metal. Al exposure inhibits bone formation. Few studies have investigated the mechanism of inhibitory effects of Al on bone formation. Thus, in this study, osteoblasts were cultured and exposed to different concentrations of Al to investigate the mechanism behind the inhibitory effects of Al on bone formation. Al-treated osteoblasts showed signs of oxidative stress and a high apoptosis rate. The levels of osteoblasts activity markers (bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein and bone alkaline phosphatase) were significantly lower in the Al-treated groups than in the control group. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a major signaling pathway in regulating cell apoptosis, was activated. The phosphorylation state of JNK was significantly increased. The mRNA and protein expression of c-Jun were both significantly upregulated. The pro-apoptotic genes (caspase 3, caspase 9, bax, and factor-related apoptosis ligand) were significantly increased. However, Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic gene, was significantly decreased. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that Al induces osteoblast apoptosis by activating the oxidative stress-mediated JNK pathway, which causes cell injuries and reduces the number and function of osteoblasts, thereby inhibiting bone formation.
Tamoxifen is used in the treatment of selected patients with breast carcinoma. Rarely, it has been shown to cause ocular toxic effects including crystalline retinopathy.
Retrospective analysis of clinical and functional (visual acuity, visual field, colour vision) data of a case series of eight female patients under tamoxifen therapy with electrophysiological examination.
Seven of eight patients complained of visual disturbances. In one case, examination showed crystalline deposits in the cornea and macular area. Three patients revealed changes in full-field and multifocal electroretinogram, and two had a pathological multifocal electroretinogram only. In six cases we applied a desaturated panel D-15 colour vision test; five of these showed some disorders.
Most tamoxifen patients who complained of visual disturbances showed electrophysiological changes, particularly in the multifocal electroretinogram and often without a certain morphological correlate. We recommend electrophysiological examination for patients with unclear visual deterioration who are receiving tamoxifen therapy.
In healthy individuals, acute changes in cholesterol intake produce modest changes in plasma cholesterol levels. A striking exception occurs in sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased intestinal absorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols, hypercholesterolemia, and premature coronary atherosclerosis. We identified seven different mutations in two adjacent, oppositely oriented genes that encode new members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (six mutations in ABCG8 and one in ABCG5) in nine patients with sitosterolemia. The two genes are expressed at highest levels in liver and intestine and, in mice, cholesterol feeding up-regulates expressions of both genes. These data suggest that ABCG5 and ABCG8 normally cooperate to limit intestinal absorption and to promote biliary excretion of sterols, and that mutated forms of these transporters predispose to sterol accumulation and atherosclerosis.
Over the past three years we have seen twelve patients who have become depressed while taking cimetidine. Clinically the depression is similar to that seen in a Primary Affective Disorder. Two representative cases are presented. It is suggested that cimetidine has precipitated a depressive reaction is vulnerable patients. Tricyclic antidepressants are effective in relieving the depression. It is postulated that cimetidine, by blocking H2 receptors in the CNS, produces an imbalance between H1 and H2. This imbalance may be an etiological factor in precipitating the depression. Tricyclic antidepressants have little effect on H2 but are potent H1 receptor blockers. This H1 blockade could restore the balance between H1 and H2, thereby relieving the depression.
A case report is presented of a 79 year old patient with a bilateral brochopneumonia. Four days after beginning the therapy with cephalothin and furosemide an acute renal failure appeared and six days later a haemolytic anaemia was observed. The modificated Coombs test was positive. The post mortem histiological examination of the kidneys revealed cloudy swelling, necrosis of tubuli, containing protein cylinders ("chromoproteid kidney").
Female CBA mice were injected 1 mg/kg diethylstilbestrol (DES) on day 17 of gestation. Their male progeny received 15 weekly injections of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) starting from the age of 2 months. Prenatal treatment with DES was followed by a significant acceleration and higher frequency of DMH-induced renal adenomas and renal capsule sarcomas in males. Tumor-induction was significantly enhanced by androgen effect. This was matched by a higher frequency of induced tumors of the large bowel. The increased frequency of androgen-dependent renal malignancies, served as indirect evidence of hyperandrogenization being stimulated in CBA male mice by prenatal treatment with DES.
To examine the effects of intravesical cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors on the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced overactive bladder (OAB).
In all, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, OAB, and COX-2 inhibitor-treated groups. OAB was induced by an intraperitoneal injection with CYP. Cystometry was performed in all rats and, in half of the OAB rats, a COX-2 inhibitor was administered intravesically. The bladders of all rats were stained immunohistochemically for iNOS and NGF.
In the OAB rats, the contraction interval and intercontraction interval were significantly shorter than in control rats, and the contraction time and pressure were significantly greater. In the COX-2 inhibitor-treated rats, the contraction interval and intercontraction interval were significantly longer than in the OAB rats, and the contraction time was significantly shorter. On immunohistochemical staining, there was no iNOS activity and NGF activity was minimally localized in the mucosa and submucosa in the control group. In the OAB rats, NGF activity in the mucosa and submucosa were increased, and there was greater expression of iNOS in all layers and of NGF in detrusor; in the COX-2 inhibitor-treated rats, their expression was less in all layers.
Intravesical instillation with COX-2 inhibitors can reduce CYP-induced bladder hyperactivity and expression of iNOS and NGF. Intravesical instillation with COX-2 inhibitors can be considered as a possible treatment for OAB.
Diabetes mellitus is a highly prevalent metabolic disease affecting 29.1 million people or 9.3% of the population of the United States. The most prevalent form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes (T2D) which comprises 90-95% of all reported cases of diabetes. While the exact cause of T2D remains an enigma, known risk factors include age, weight, sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits, and genetic predisposition. However, these risk factors can not sufficiently explain the increasing prevalence of T2D. Recently, environmental exposures have been explored as potential risk factors. Indeed, epidemiological and limited empirical studies have revealed elevated serum concentrations of certain persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including the bioaccumulative metabolite of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), are positively correlated with increased T2D prevalence. The goal of the present study is to determine if chronic exposure to DDE promotes T2D in a widely used in vivo model, the high saturated fat-fed mouse. Male C57BL/6H mice were exposed to DDE (2.0mg/kg) or vehicle (corn oil; 1ml/kg) via gavage for 5 consecutive days, then every 7 days for the duration of the study. One week following the 5 day consecutive DDE dosing, animals were placed on either a low fat (10%kcal from lard) or high fat (45%kcal from lard) diet (HFD) for 13 weeks. Chronic exposure to DDE promoted fasting hyperglycemia after 4 and 8 weeks on the HFD diet and normalized fasting blood glucose levels at week 13. This DDE-mediated decrease in fasting hyperglycemia was preceded by improved glucose tolerance at week 12. In addition to normalizing fasting hyperglycemia at the end of high fat feeding, DDE exposure decreased HFD-induced fasting hyperinsulinemia, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values, and hepatic steatosis. Therefore, based on the current data, chronic DDE exposure appears to have a biphasic effect on HFD-induced hyperglycemia in the male C57BL/6H mouse characterized by elevated fasting blood glucose at weeks 4 and 8 of HFD intake followed by normoglycemia upon sacrifice. In addition, chronic DDE exposure reduced HFD-induced hepatic steatosis upon sacrifice. These results indicate chronic exposure to DDE can directly affect systemic glucose and hepatic lipid metabolism and that these effects can be diet dependent.
Stents increase smooth muscle cell proliferation, which may also lead to in-stent restenosis. A local delivery strategy provides higher drug concentration at the angioplasty site and may limit the proliferative response following stenting. Local heparin delivery was attempted in 35 patients following balloon angioplasty using an "over-the-balloon" style catheter (infusion sleeve). The infusion sleeve was successfully tracked and heparin was delivered in 33 (94%) patients. Heparin (1,000 IU/ml) was delivered under low (45 psi, 2 ml, n = 4), intermediate (75 psi, 4 ml, n = 11), and high (100 psi, 4 ml, n = 18) proximal infusion pressures. Stent placement was successful in all cases. Acute and in-hospital complications were a severe arterial spasm after heparin delivery, a non Q-wave myocardial infarction, and two vascular complications. Ten dissections were observed after PTCA and prior to heparin delivery. Of these dissections, 7 remained unchanged, 2 worsened, and 1 improved with local delivery. When heparin was delivered in the absence of dissection, no new dissections were observed. Of the 33 patients who received heparin, 30 (91%) had no symptoms and a negative exercise test at clinical follow-up. QCA analysis of 6-month follow-up angiograms, performed in 32 of 33 (97%) patients, demonstrated an acute gain of 1.98 +/- 0.67 mm, a late loss of 0.94 +/- 0.78 mm, a net gain of 1.04 +/- 0.78 mm, and a loss index of 0.48 +/- 0.32. Restenosis (> or = 50% stenosis) was observed in 4 of 32 (12%) patients. Local delivery of heparin via the infusion sleeve following PTCA and prior to stent deployment is feasible with an acceptable safety profile and a low clinical and angiographic restenosis rate at 6 months.
Cancer patients can be exposed to drug interactions during treatment with toxic anticancer drugs. The peripheral nervous system is a target for neurotoxic anticancer drugs. P-glycoprotein is essential for the functional integrity of blood-tissue barriers, and P-glycoprotein inhibition due to possible drug interactions could lead to adverse neurotoxic reactions.
In a rat model of vincristine-induced neuropathy, we assessed the consequences of potential drug interactions of vincristine with some P-glycoprotein-inhibiting drugs, chosen because of their potency to increase the incorporation of (99m)Tc-sestamibi in nervous tissue.
Quinidine (30 mg/kg) increased (99m)Tc-sestamibi incorporation in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) but was toxic for rats. Verapamil (30 mg/kg) increased the tracer incorporation in the spinal cord, DRG and sciatic nerve. Combination treatment with the verapamil-vincristine regimen had a tendency to lower weight gain and altered nociceptive thresholds of neuropathic animals.
Behavioral pain tests did not reveal an increase in vincristine neurotoxicity following combination treatment with verapamil and vincristine. This regimen only led to a slight increase in general toxicity.
Cytokines are implicated in the anaemia of chronic disease by reducing erythropoiesis and increasing iron sequestration in the reticuloendotheial system. However, the effect of cytokines, in particular TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha), on small bowel iron uptake and iron-transporter expression remains unclear. In the present study, we subjected CD1 male mice to intraperitoneal injection with TNFalpha (10 ng/mouse) and then examined the expression and localization of DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1), IREG1 (iron-regulated protein 1) and ferritin in duodenum. Liver and spleen samples were used to determine hepcidin mRNA expression. Changes in serum iron and iron loading of duodenum, spleen and liver were also determined. We found a significant (P<0.05) fall in serum iron 3 h post-TNFalpha exposure. This was coincident with increased iron deposition in the spleen. After 24 h of exposure, there was a significant decrease in duodenal iron transfer (P<0.05) coincident with increased enterocyte ferritin expression (P<0.05) and re-localization of IREG1 from the basolateral enterocyte membrane. Hepatic hepcidin mRNA levels remained unchanged, whereas splenic hepcidin mRNA expression was reduced at 24 h. In conclusion, we provide evidence that TNFalpha may contribute to anaemia of chronic disease by iron sequestration in the spleen and by reduced duodenal iron transfer, which seems to be due to increased enterocyte iron binding by ferritin and a loss of IREG1 function. These observations were independent of hepcidin mRNA levels.
We have examined the correlation between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and metastatic properties of a low metastatic osteosarcoma cell line, osteosarcoma takase (OST), under stimulation by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). In vivo, OST cells exhibited significantly increased colonization in the lungs of nude mice in a dose-dependent manner when they were treated by TNF alpha prior to injection. In vitro, TNF alpha enhanced tumour cell invasion through the reconstituted basement membrane in a transwell chamber up to 2.5-fold. Gelatin zymography and sandwich enzyme immunoassays demonstrated marked production of MMP-9 [92-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase (gelatinase B)] but not MMP-2 [72-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase (gelatinase A)], MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) or MMP-7 (matrilysin). Motility of the tumour cells and adhesion to cultured endothelial cells were slightly increased by the TNF alpha treatment up to 1.6-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively, while the growth rate was decreased. These results suggest that upregulation of MMP-9 together with enhanced motility and endothelial adhesion contribute to the increased metastatic ability of OST cells induced by TNF alpha treatment.
A newly devised radioimmunoassay for the measurement of myocardial myoglobin has been modified by us to measure circulating myoglobin levels in rats subjected to isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction of various degrees of severity. The method has been found to be very effective. Myoglobinemia proved to be a sensitive index of early myocardial damage in rats, perhaps superseding the enzyme CPK in detecting early myocardial damage. Both myoglobin and CPK were equally effective in providing an index of the extent of histopathologic myocardial infarction. The changes in myoglobin and CPK did not correlate well with the changes in plasma SGOT, SGPT, and LDH, which are more diagnostic of the later stages of acute myocardial infarction. Myoglobinemia offers excellent promise as a diagnostic aid in detecting early myocardial infarction in rats, and perhaps ultimately in humans, since there are only small differences between the immunologic specificity of human versus rat myoglobin.
There are several reports of Fanconi syndrome (FS) with or without nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, treated with various antiretroviral medications like cidofovir, adefovir, didenosine and tenofovir. But neither FS nor NDI has been documented with abacavir therapy. We are reporting the first case of abacavir-induced reversible FS with NDI in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, who recovered completely with supportive treatment and discontinuation of abacavir.
In a 6-month, randomized, double-blind study the effects of two combined oral contraceptives containing 150 micrograms desogestrel and either 20 or 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol on hemostatic parameters were investigated in 1633 healthy women. Compared with baseline, the 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol formulation increased prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (+72.2%), D-dimer (+42.4%) and protein C activity (+6.1%), whereas antithrombin-III activity (-6.3%) and protein S activity (-19.7%) were decreased. The use of the 20 micrograms ethinylestradiol formulation was associated with the same pattern of changes, but with lower magnitude (F1+2 + 61.1%, D-dimer +36.0%, antithrombin III -5.3%, protein C +4.6% and protein S-16.0%). The changes from baseline were significantly smaller in the 20 micrograms ethinylestradiol group for D-dimer, antithrombin III and protein S than in the 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol group (p = 0.019, p = 0.038 and p = 0.001, respectively). One woman with a combined deficiency of proteins C and S developed deep venous thrombosis while using the 20 micrograms ethinylestradiol formulation. Use of both formulations was associated with a shift of the coagulation-fibrinolysis balance to an enhanced fibrin-generating and fibrin-degradating activity. The less-pronounced effect on hemostasis with the 20 micrograms ethinylestradiol preparation is reassuring with regard to thromboembolic risk in general. However, women with coagulation inhibitor deficiency should be advised not to use oral contraceptives.
Pergolide, an ergot-derived dopamine agonist prescribed since the late 1980's mainly in Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome has recognized fibrosis side effects, affecting the pleural, pericardial and retroperitoneal systems. Pergolide-induced valvulopathies were first reported in 2002. We present here the history of a patient developing an isolated pulmonary hypertension related to the intake of pergolide. The dyspnea related to the pulmonary hypertension as well as the echocardiographic abnormalities improved after treatment replacement. Valvulopathies and pulmonary hypertension were previously described under appetite-suppressant drugs after years of clinical use, in a similar way.
Brain malformations are individually rare but collectively common causes of developmental disabilities. Many forms of malformation occur sporadically and are associated with reduced reproductive fitness, pointing to a causative role for de novo mutations. Here, we report a study of Baraitser-Winter syndrome, a well-defined disorder characterized by distinct craniofacial features, ocular colobomata and neuronal migration defect. Using whole-exome sequencing of three proband-parent trios, we identified de novo missense changes in the cytoplasmic actin-encoding genes ACTB and ACTG1 in one and two probands, respectively. Sequencing of both genes in 15 additional affected individuals identified disease-causing mutations in all probands, including two recurrent de novo alterations (ACTB, encoding p.Arg196His, and ACTG1, encoding p.Ser155Phe). Our results confirm that trio-based exome sequencing is a powerful approach to discover genes causing sporadic developmental disorders, emphasize the overlapping roles of cytoplasmic actin proteins in development and suggest that Baraitser-Winter syndrome is the predominant phenotype associated with mutation of these two genes.
Stress-induced hypokalemia represents a transient risk factor for malignant arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease. The adrenergic nervous system serves as a major control system for the transport of potassium across the cell membrane. Nonselective beta-blockade presents epinephrine-mediated hypokalemia. This helps explain a possible mechanism for the significant improvement in morbidity and mortality rates of patients taking long-term propranolol therapy in the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial report.
Induction of differentiation and apoptosis in cancer cells through ligands of nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) is a novel and promising approach to cancer therapy. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), an RA receptor-specific NHR ligand, is now used for selective cancers. The NHR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is expressed in breast cancer cells. Activation of PPARgamma through a synthetic ligand, troglitazone (TGZ), and other PPARgamma-activators cause inhibition of proliferation and lipid accumulation in cultured breast cancer cells. TGZ (10(-5) M, 4 days) reversibly inhibits clonal growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells and the combination of TGZ (10(-5) M) and ATRA (10(-6) M, 4 days) synergistically and irreversibly inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of MCF7 cells, associated with a dramatic decrease of their bcl-2 protein levels. Similar effects are noted with in vitro cultured breast cancer tissues from patients, but not with normal breast epithelial cells. The observed apoptosis mediated by TGZ and ATRA may be related to the striking down-regulation of bcl-2, because forced over-expression of bcl-2 in MCF7 cells cultured with TGZ and ATRA blocks their cell death. TGZ significantly inhibits MCF7 tumor growth in triple immunodeficient mice. Combined administration of TGZ and ATRA causes prominent apoptosis and fibrosis of these tumors without toxic effects on the mice. Taken together, this combination may provide a novel, nontoxic and selective therapy for human breast cancers.
Arterial thromboembolic events are not common after chemotherapy. We present a case of a cerebrovascular accident, which developed after chemotherapy in a patient with a germ cell tumor. A 34-year-old man with a testicular germ cell tumor who did not have any comorbid disease was admitted to hospital. After a radical inguinal orchiectomy, BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin) chemotherapy regimen was given. On the 10th day of the third cycle, aphasia and hemiplegia developed. Cerebrovascular accident was diagnosed. This event is a rare complication in a patient receiving BEP chemotherapy who did not have cardiovascular disease or thromboembolic risk factors.
We hypothesized that redox-mediated apoptosis of medial smooth muscle cells (SMC) during the acute phase of vascular injury contributes to the pathophysiology of vascular disease.
Apoptosis of medial SMC (1-14 days following balloon injury) was identified in rat carotid arteries by in situ DNA labeling. NADPH-derived superoxide and expression of Bcl-xL, Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 were assessed. The antioxidant tempol was administered in drinking water throughout the experimental period, and local adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of eNOS was performed prior to vascular injury.
Balloon injury increased NADPH-dependent superoxide production, medial SMC apoptosis, Bax-positive medial SMC index, Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression in the injured arteries. Treatment with tempol or eNOS gene transfer decreased superoxide levels and medial SMC apoptosis, with a concomitant increase in medial SMC density. Inhibition of superoxide was associated with a decreased Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, and caspase-3 and -9 expression. Tempol treatment and eNOS gene therapy significantly reduced neointima formation.
Vascular generation of reactive oxygen species participates in Bax activation and medial SMC apoptosis. These effects likely contribute to the shedding of cell-cell adhesion molecules and promote medial SMC migration and proliferation responsible for neointimal hyperplasia.
