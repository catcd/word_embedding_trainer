Podocyte damage and apoptosis are thought to be important if not essential in the development of glomerulosclerosis. Female estrogen receptor knockout mice develop glomerulosclerosis at 9 months of age due to excessive ovarian testosterone production and secretion. Here, we studied the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis in this mouse model to determine whether testosterone and/or 17β-estradiol directly affect the function and survival of podocytes. Glomerulosclerosis in these mice was associated with the expression of desmin and the loss of nephrin, markers of podocyte damage and apoptosis. Ovariectomy preserved the function and survival of podocytes by eliminating the source of endogenous testosterone production. In contrast, testosterone supplementation induced podocyte apoptosis in ovariectomized wild-type mice. Importantly, podocytes express functional androgen and estrogen receptors, which, upon stimulation by their respective ligands, have opposing effects. Testosterone induced podocyte apoptosis in vitro by androgen receptor activation, but independent of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. Pretreatment with 17β-estradiol prevented testosterone-induced podocyte apoptosis, an estrogen receptor-dependent effect mediated by activation of the ERK signaling pathway, and protected podocytes from TGF-β1- or TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Thus, podocytes are target cells for testosterone and 17β-estradiol. These hormones modulate podocyte damage and apoptosis.
Clopidogrel has been reported to be safe and effective in reducing vascular events. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that clopidogrel may cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome (TTP/HUS). This association has been debated, since in several cases alternative causes could not be excluded. Two new cases of TTP/HUS associated with clopidogrel are reported here. After discontinuation of clopidogrel and treatment with plasma exchange, both patients had a complete and sustained recovery from TTP/HUS. These cases corroborate previous observations that clopidogrel may indeed be a rare cause of TTP/HUS.
Benzene is a common industrial chemical known to induce leukemia and other blood disorders, as well as aneuploidy, in both human blood cells and sperm at exposures > 10 ppm. Recent reports have identified health effects at exposure levels < 1 ppm, the permissible exposure limit (PEL; 8 hr) set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
We investigated whether occupational exposures to benzene near 1 ppm induce aneuploidy in sperm.
We used multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization to measure the incidence of sperm with numerical abnormalities of chromosomes X, Y, and 21 among 33 benzene-exposed men and 33 unexposed men from Chinese factories. Individual exposures were assessed using personal air monitoring and urinary concentrations of benzene and trans,trans-muconic acid (E,E-MA). Air benzene concentrations were not detectable in unexposed men; in exposed men, concentrations ranged from below the detection limit to 24 ppm (median, 2.9 ppm), with 27% of exposed men (n = 9) having concentrations of <or= 1 ppm. Exposed men were categorized into low and high groups based on urinary E,E-MA (median concentrations of 1.9 and 14.4 mg/L, respectively; median air benzene of 1 and 7.7 ppm, respectively), and aneuploidy frequencies were compared with those of unexposed men.
Sperm aneuploidy increased across low- and high-exposed groups for disomy X [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-3.4; and IRR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.5-4.9, respectively], and for overall hyperhaploidy for the three chromosomes investigated (IRR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.4; and IRR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.6, respectively). We also found elevated disomy X and hyperhaploidy in the nine men exposed to <or= 1 ppm benzene compared with unexposed men (IRR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0; and IRR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9, respectively).
Benzene appeared to increase the frequencies of aneuploid sperm for chromosomes associated with chromosomal abnormality syndromes in human offspring, even in men whose air benzene exposure was at or below the U.S. permissible exposure limit.
Two preeclamptic women became profoundly hypotensive while receiving magnesium sulfate. No evidence of toxic levels was present in either. In both, preeclampsia-induced hypovolemia was extreme. That nontoxic magnesium levels can cause severe hypotension is an alarming possibility. Acknowledgment of this complication and expeditious reversal of the problem is essential.
To describe a successful transition process from subcutaneous treprostinil to intravenous epoprostenol after the failure of treprostinil in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and present an algorithm to achieve the conversion without significant adverse reactions.
A 25-year-old white female receiving subcutaneous treprostinil 97 ng/kg/min was admitted to the intensive care unit for transition from subcutaneous treprostinil to a target intravenous epoprostenol dose of 72 ng/kg/min via a staggered interval dose adjustment approach. The patient experienced facial flushing, hot flashes, and headache when dose adjustments of the drugs were made simultaneously; however, when dose adjustments were staggered, the adverse reactions did not occur and larger adjustments could be achieved.
This case demonstrates a suboptimal therapeutic response to treprostinil for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The transition of treprostinil to epoprostenol is rare; however, in the event therapy change is needed, dosing information is minimal. A staggered transition dosing regimen that accounts for the pharmacokinetic differences between epoprostenol and treprostinil was successfully used in this case.
The approach in this case demonstrates the success of staggered-interval dose adjustments to minimize supratherapeutic symptoms and coincides with the pharmacokinetic profile of the 2 medications.
Women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a worse prognosis compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Hormonal or Herceptin-based therapies were found to be ineffective because of the loss of target receptors, such as ER, PR, and HER-2 amplification. Conventional chemo- and/ or radiation therapy also seems to have limited efficacy in TNBC patients. We studied the effects of cisplatin plus TRAIL on 1 normal and 2 TNBC cells in vitro. The in vitro studies indicate that cisplatin plus TRAIL significantly enhanced cell death in TNBC cell lines CRL2335 and MDA-MB-468 by approximately 60%-70% compared with approximately 10%-15% in CRL8799 normal breast cell line. Treatment with cisplatin/TRAIL also inhibited the expression of EGFR, p63, survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL in TNBC cells. Specific inhibition of EGFR and/or p63 protein in TNBC cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) does not increase TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, inhibition of survivin by siRNA enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These observations suggested the possibility that survivin played an important role in cisplatin plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. In vivo experiments, treatment of mice with cisplatin plus TRAIL resulted in a significant inhibition of CRL2335 xenograft tumors compared with untreated control tumors. Taken together the data suggest that cisplatin plus TRAIL treatment have the potential of providing a new strategy for improving the therapeutic outcome in TNBC patients.
The allergen-specific IgE antibody was determined in 20 men and 120 women with psoriasis and the results were correlated with a history of current and previous allergic disease. Allergic disease was reported in 21% of the patients, but a positive RAST test was obtained in 44%. In chronic plaque-type psoriasis a positive RAST test was significantly more common (58%) than in active psoriasis (22%). Grass pollen and house dust mite were the most prevalent sensitizing allergens, with frequencies of 64% and 53%, respectively in the sensitized subjects. Sensitization increased with age and polysensitization was common. Contact dermatitis was verified with patch tests in 12 men and 20 woman, of whom 10 had chronic plaque-type psoriasis and 22 active psoriasis. Tar, nickel sulphate, corticosteroid mixture and thiomersal were the most common allergens. No irritant reactions were seen at the concentrations used. Atopic allergic diseases and contact sensitization were therefore common among our psoriatic patients.
Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant drug which is an analog to 6-mercaptopurine and has been used in the last 20 years to prevent organ transplant rejection. It has also been used in the treatment of some autoimmunological diseases. We present a case of a 24-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus, suffering from nephritis, who developed angioedema after using azathioprine to control her illness. She had never reported similar episodes. The involvement of the drug was demonstrated by positive oral challenge test without changes in biochemical and complement blood determinations. She reached tolerance to the drug after a desensitization procedure (increasing 5 mg each day to reach 125 mg daily). We are not able to propose the involvement of an IgE-mediated mechanism, but rather a hypersensitive one with a non-dose-dependent effect. These desensitization procedures show great potential as therapeutic safeguards against harmful drugs in some patients. We have not found any other desensitization procedure for this drug.
Cell damage and spatial localization deficits are often reported as long-term consequences of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of repeated drug administration after long-lasting status epilepticus. Groups of six to eight Wistar rats received microinjections of pilocarpine (2.4 mg/microl, 1 microl) in the right dorsal hippocampus to induce a status epilepticus, which was attenuated by thiopental injection (35 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 hrs after onset. Treatments consisted of i.p. administration of diazepam, ketamine, carbamazepine, or phenytoin at 4, 28, 52, and 76 hr after the onset of status epilepticus. Two days after the treatments, rats were tested in the Morris water maze and 1 week after the cognitive tests, their brains were submitted to histology to perform haematoxylin and eosin staining and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescence detection. Post-status epilepticus rats exhibited extensive gliosis and cell loss in the hippocampal CA1, CA3 (70% cell loss for both areas) and dentate gyrus (60%). Administration of all drugs reduced cell loss in the hippocampus, with best effects observed in brains slices of diazepam-treated animals, which showed less than 30% of loss in the three areas and decreased GFAP immunolabelling. Treatments improved spatial navigation during training trials and probe trial, with exception of ketamine. Interestingly, in the probe trial, only diazepam-treated animals showed preference for the goal quadrant. Our data point to significant neuroprotective effects of repeated administration of diazepam against status epilepticus-induced cell damage and cognitive disturbances.
We report a case of postpartum convulsions due to a benign cerebral angiopathy occurring after bromocriptine therapy to suppress lactation. This case analyses the current knowledge concerning this rare entity. It allows pointing out special measures that must be taken with the administration of bromocriptine.
Methamphetamine (MA) not only affects the nervous system but also has cardiac toxicity and immunosuppressive properties. This manuscript will provide support that there is a relationship between MA use and heart disease as well as immune dysfunction. The cardiovascular manifestations of acute MA use include tachycardia, atrioventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, myocardial ischemia and hypertension, resulting in cardiac lesions. Chronic use of MA causes cardiomyopathy including cellular infiltration, myocardial hypertrophy, myocardium rupture and fibrosis. The increased catecholamine levels are responsible for the cardiac lesions induced by MA. The additional problem with MA use is its potential to disrupt the immune system function leading to suppression of mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte, a reduction in circulating lymphocyte numbers and alternation T-lymphocyte cytokine secretion as well as B cell proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Concomitant MA use and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection not only enhances immunosuppression associated with HIV but also increases the heart disease occurrence with a coincidentally complication of AIDS or AIDS medications.
The cardiovascular effects of cannabinoids can be influenced by anaesthesia and can differ in chronic hypertension, but the extent to which they are influenced by acute hypertension in conscious animals has not been determined.
We examined cardiovascular responses to intravenous administration of anandamide and the synthetic cannabinoid, (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone (WIN55212-2), in conscious male Wistar rats made acutely hypertensive by infusion of angiotensin II (AII) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). Rats were chronically instrumented for measurement of arterial blood pressure and vascular conductances in the renal, mesenteric and hindquarters beds.
Anandamide dose-dependently decreased the mean arterial blood pressure of rats made hypertensive by AII-AVP infusion, but not normotensive rats. Interestingly, acute hypertension also revealed a hypotensive response to WIN55212-2, which caused hypertension in normotensive animals. The enhanced depressor effects of the cannabinoids in acute hypertension were associated with increased vasodilatation in hindquarters, renal and mesenteric vascular beds. Treatment with URB597, which inhibits anandamide degradation by fatty acid amide hydrolase, potentiated the depressor and mesenteric vasodilator responses to anandamide. Furthermore, haemodynamic responses to WIN55212-2, but not to anandamide, were attenuated by the CB(1) receptor antagonist, AM251 [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophen yl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide].
These results broadly support the literature showing that the cardiovascular effects of cannabinoids can be exaggerated in hypertension, but highlight the involvement of non-CB(1) receptor-mediated mechanisms in the actions of anandamide.
Renal function was evaluated in 12 children (aged 2.5-17.5 years) who received ifosfamide as part of their chemotherapy for different malignancies. A blood and urine analysis evaluating renal glomerular and tubular function and an isotopic determination of glomerular filtration were carried out four months or later after treatment had been stopped. Three patients had several biochemical abnormalities suggesting a significant degree of proximal renal dysfunction (increased urinary excretion of calcium, glucose, beta 2-microglobulin, amino acids (three patients) and decreased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (one patient)). The tubular dysfunction in these patients was associated with a diminished glomerular filtration. These patients could be characterized by their younger age at treatment and a higher dose of ifosfamide received if calculated per kg body weight.
The cytostatic drug Adriamycin can, when given in overdose, cause a congestive (dilative) cardiomyopathy. In 120 patients, chest X-ray and ECG proved unsuitable for the early detection of this cardiomyopathy. However, a relatively early diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy can be made using echocardiography, radiocardiography, including determination of the minimal cardiac transit time, and through the determination of systolic time intervals. Especially the latter method represents a simple, economic, and yet exact means for the early recognition of Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Massive urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine and kynurenine, known as xanthurenic aciduria or hydroxykynureninuria, in a young Somali boy suggested kynureninase deficiency. Mutation analysis of KYNU encoding kynureninase of the index case revealed homozygosity for a c.593 A > G substitution leading to a threonine-to-alanine (T198A) shift. A younger brother was found to have a similar excretion pattern and the same genotype. At present, neither of the two boys has symptoms of niacin deficiency. This is the first report linking xanthurenic aciduria to a mutation in the gene encoding kynureninase.
We reported here on a case of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) with aplastic anemia treated by anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporin A. The use of this therapy resulted not only in marrow recovery but also in resolution of the skin sclerosis. A 68 year-old woman was diagnosed as lcSSc accompanied by Hashimoto's thyroiditis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Treatment by D-penicillamine was started. After 11 months, She complained of nasal bleeding and subcutaneous bleeding. Her laboratory data revealed pancytopenia. White blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration and platelet count were decreased at 2300/microl, 8.2 g/dl, and 3000/microl respectively. Bone marrow was severely hypoplastic, suggesting aplastic anemia. The etiology of hypopastic marrow was considered to be D-penicillamine which had been frequently reported to cause hematopoietic cell suppression. We immediately started methylprednisolone pulse therapy combined with G-CSF and cyclosporin A, which showed little effectiveness. Next we tried the anti-thymocyte globulin therapy combined with G-CSF and cyclosporin A. Her blood cell counts gradually improved. After 4 months, she did not need the blood transfusion anymore. Furthermore, the sclerosis of her skin began to improve gradually, and the titer of anti-centromere antibody also decreased. Thus, anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporin A combined therapy can be considered among the therapies of systemic sclerosis.
The aim of this study was to test whether increased coronary vascular resistance in hypertensive subjects can be reduced by centrally inhibiting sympathetic overactivity with dexamethasone. Coronary vascular resistance was quantitated in 11 men with untreated mild essential hypertension (RR 149 +/- 13/98 +/- 10 mm Hg) and 23 healthy, normotensive, otherwise matched men using positron emission tomography and [(15)O]H(2)O. The measurements were performed at baseline and during adenosine stimulation. Each subject was studied twice, with and without previous dexamethasone treatment for two days (0.5 mg x 4 per day). Before dexamethasone treatment, cardiac index and plasma norepinephrine concentration (1.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.5 nmol/l, p < 0.01) were significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. Additionally, both baseline and hyperemic coronary vascular resistances were higher in hypertensive than normotensive subjects (147 +/- 31 vs. 113 +/- 24 and 36 +/- 9 vs. 25 +/- 10 mm Hg.min.g.ml(-1); p < 0.05). Dexamethasone treatment significantly decreased plasma norepinephrine concentrations in hypertensive subjects, leading to comparable plasma norepinephrine concentrations in hypertensive and normotensive subjects (1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.4 nmol/l; NS). However, coronary vascular resistances remained increased in hypertensive subjects. In conclusion, hypertensive subjects are characterized by sympathetic overactivity, which can be normalized by dexamethasone. However, coronary vascular resistances remained increased in hypertensive subjects after dexamethasone treatment, suggesting that other mechanisms than sympathetic overactivity-induced vasoconstriction explain the increased coronary vascular resistance in hypertension.
The aim of this study was to predict cardiovascular complications in patients with prostatic cancer treated with oestrogen. A randomised prospective study of oestrogen therapy versus orchiectomy was performed. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidity were excluded (16%). Prior to the initiation of therapy, patients were subjected to exercise stress tests, physiological evaluation of peripheral circulation, blood volume estimation, chest X-ray, blood test, including hormones, lipoproteins, and antithrombin III, and a physical examination and history by a cardiologist. The oestrogen treatment and the orchiectomy group did not differ with regard to these pretreatment variables; 25% of the patients given oestrogen therapy had cardiovascular complications during the initial treatment year compared with none in the orchiectomy group. Three statistical discriminating techniques were employed and they allowed us to identify 2 strong discriminating variables for cardiovascular complications if oestrogen therapy is instituted in patients with prostatic cancer but without overt clinical cardiovascular disease. These 2 discriminators were luteinising hormone (LH) and ST-segment depression during exercise. This means that a patient with ST-segment depression during an exercise test and/or a high luteinising hormone concentration should not be treated with oestrogen.
Factors related to the risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma in diethylstilbestrol-exposed women were investigated in 156 patients in the United States with clear cell adenocarcinoma and documented diethylstilbestrol exposure (Registry cases) and 1848 diethylstilbestrol-exposed women of similar age without cancer (National Cooperative Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis Project). Diethylstilbestrol dosage patterns, the use of other hormones, mother's age and pregnancy history, and daughter's birth month, birth weight, and age at menarche were compared. The relative risk was higher for those whose mothers began diethylstilbestrol before the twelfth week of pregnancy and for those who were born in the fall (winter conception). Maternal history of at least one prior spontaneous abortion elevated the risk. Supportive evidence for the difference in birth month distribution was also found by a comparison with United States vital statistics. Each factor was confirmed to be significant in a multivariate logistic model that examined all of them with region and year of birth adjusted.
Complete heart block with severe Adams-Stokes attacks and polymyositis was observed in a 69-year-old man following 6 weeks penicillamine treatment for suspected rheumatoid arthritis. After drug withdrawal the muscle enzymes and the cardiac rhythm gradually normalized, only leaving a right bundle branch block. Although this is the first report to show that severe cardiac damage associated with penicillamine-induced polymyositis is a potentially reversible condition, the severity of the three cases reported so far warrants close observation for cardiac involvement in patients with penicillamine-induced polymyositis.
Multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene encodes the ATP-dependent cellular efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which efflux of a variety of substances across the membrane. P-gp could serve a role in cancer etiology based on its physiological role of protecting cells from xenobiotics or metabolites. The C3435T (rs1045642) polymorphism of the MDR1 gene which could influence the P-gp expression and function have been implicated in the cancer risk. However, the results from the published studies on the association between this polymorphism and cancer risk are conflicting. To drive a more precise estimation of this association, we performed a meta-analysis of 39 case-control studies, including a total of 9,265 cancer cases and 13,502 controls. We used odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association. Overall, individuals with the MDR1 3435TT genotype were associated with an increased cancer risk than those with the CC (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.10-1.51) or CT/CC (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.34) genotypes, similar to the CT or CT/TT compared with the CC genotype. In the stratified analyses, the increased risks were more pounced among hematologic malignances (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.10-1.46, P (heterogeneity) = 0.415), breast cancer (1.42, 1.04-1.94, 0.018), renal cancer (1.77, 1.28-2.46, 0.307), Caucasians (1.21, 1.07-1.38, 0.000) and population-based studies (1.20, 1.05-1.36, 0.000) in a dominant model. The results suggested that the MDR1 C3435T polymorphism may contribute to cancer risk.
Exposure of rats to the pesticide and complex I inhibitor rotenone reproduces features of Parkinson's disease, including selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and alpha-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic inclusions (Betarbet et al., 2000; Sherer et al., 2003). Here, we examined mechanisms of rotenone toxicity using three model systems. In SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells, rotenone (10 nm to 1 microm) caused dose-dependent ATP depletion, oxidative damage, and death. To determine the molecular site of action of rotenone, cells were transfected with the rotenone-insensitive single-subunit NADH dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NDI1), which incorporates into the mammalian ETC and acts as a "replacement" for endogenous complex I. In response to rotenone, NDI1-transfected cells did not show mitochondrial impairment, oxidative damage, or death, demonstrating that these effects of rotenone were caused by specific interactions at complex I. Although rotenone caused modest ATP depletion, equivalent ATP loss induced by 2-deoxyglucose was without toxicity, arguing that bioenergetic defects were not responsible for cell death. In contrast, reducing oxidative damage with antioxidants, or by NDI1 transfection, blocked cell death. To determine the relevance of rotenone-induced oxidative damage to dopaminergic neuronal death, we used a chronic midbrain slice culture model. In this system, rotenone caused oxidative damage and dopaminergic neuronal loss, effects blocked by alpha-tocopherol. Finally, brains from rotenone-treated animals demonstrated oxidative damage, most notably in midbrain and olfactory bulb, dopaminergic regions affected by Parkinson's disease. These results, using three models of increasing complexity, demonstrate the involvement of oxidative damage in rotenone toxicity and support the evaluation of antioxidant therapies for Parkinson's disease.
The present report describes a mother and 2 children with leucine-induced hypoglycemia (LIH). Hypoglycemic episodes following high-protein meals first appeared at age 4-7 months. Leucine-stimulation tests triggered marked hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia in the children and a milder but abnormal response in the mother. To evaluate the therapeutic effects and to study the mechanism of hyperinsulinism in LIH, the leucine test was repeated under treatment with diphenylhydantoin, oxprenolol (a beta-blocker), and diazoxide. Diazoxide abolished hyperinsulinism; diphenylhydantoin did not affect the response to leucine; and oxprenolol, tested in the mother only, increased hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia. Our results indicate that LIH is an autosomal dominant disorder; LIH may persist into adulthood with milder clinical symptoms and chemical response to leucine; diazoxide is the treatment of choice in LIH. Considering the effects of the three agents on stimulated release of insulin, it is concluded that leucine triggers hyperinsulinism by a mechanism different from that of glucose and beta-adrenergic receptors.
Viral infections of the CNS and their accompanying inflammation can cause long-term neurological effects, including increased risk for seizures. To examine the effects of CNS inflammation, we infused polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, intracerebroventricularly to mimic a viral CNS infection in 14 day-old rats. This caused fever and an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1beta in the brain. As young adults, these animals were more susceptible to lithium-pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures and showed memory deficits in fear conditioning. Whereas there was no alteration in adult hippocampal cytokine levels, we found a marked increase in NMDA (NR2A and C) and AMPA (GluR1) glutamate receptor subunit mRNA expression. The increase in seizure susceptibility, glutamate receptor subunits, and hippocampal IL-1beta levels were suppressed by neonatal systemic minocycline. Thus, a novel model of viral CNS inflammation reveals pathophysiological relationships between brain cytokines, glutamate receptors, behaviour and seizures, which can be attenuated by anti-inflammatory agents like minocycline.
The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dioscin against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. In the in vitro tests, HepG2 cells were given APAP pretreatment with or without dioscin. In the in vivo experiments, mice were orally administrated dioscin for five days and then given APAP. Some biochemical and morphology parameters were assayed and the possible mechanism was investigated. Dioscin improved AST release, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and necrosis of HepG2 cells induced by APAP. Following administration of dioscin, APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice was significantly attenuated. Furthermore, the liver cell apoptosis and necrosis, and hepatic mitochondrial edema were also prevented. Fifteen differentially expressed proteins were found by using proteomics, and six of them, Suox, Krt18, Rgn, Prdx1, MDH and PNP were validated. These proteins may be involved in the hepatoprotective effect of dioscin and might cooperate with the levels of Ca(2+) in mitochondria, decreased expression of ATP2A2, and decreased mitochondrial cardiolipin. In addition, dioscin inhibited APAP-induced activation and expression of CYP2E1, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bid, and inhibited the expression of Bax, Bak and p53. Dioscin showed a remarkable protective effect against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by adjusting mitochondrial function. These results indicated that dioscin has the capability on the treatment of liver injury.
Problems related to illegal amphetamine use have become a major public health issue in many developed countries. To date, evidence on the effectiveness of psychosocial treatments has remained modest, and no pharmacotherapy has proven effective for amphetamine dependence.
Individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for intravenous amphetamine dependence (N=53) were randomly assigned to receive aripiprazole (15 mg/day), slow-release methylphenidate (54 mg/day), or placebo for 20 weeks. The study was terminated prematurely due to unexpected results of interim analysis. An intention-to-treat analysis was used. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of amphetamine-positive urine samples.
Patients allocated to aripiprazole had significantly more amphetamine-positive urine samples than patients in the placebo group (odds ratio=3.77, 95% CI=1.55-9.18), whereas patients who received methylphenidate had significantly fewer amphetamine-positive urine samples than patients who had received placebo (odds ratio=0.46, 95% CI=0.26-0.81).
Methylphenidate is an effective treatment for reducing intravenous drug use in patients with severe amphetamine dependence.
Gomesin is an antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of a common Brazilian tarantula spider named Acanthoscurria gomesiana. This peptide exerts antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo by an unknown mechanism. In this study, the cytotoxic mechanism of gomesin in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells was investigated. Gomesin induced necrotic cell death and was cytotoxic to SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells. The peptide evoked a rapid and transient elevation of intracellular calcium levels in Fluo-4-AM loaded PC12 cells, which was inhibited by nimodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker. Preincubation with nimodipine also inhibited cell death induced by gomesin in SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells. Gomesin-induced cell death was prevented by the pretreatment with MAPK/ERK, PKC or PI3K inhibitors, but not with PKA inhibitor. In addition, gomesin generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SH-SY5Y cells, which were blocked with nimodipine and MAPK/ERK, PKC or PI3K inhibitors. Taken together, these results suggest that gomesin could be a useful anticancer agent, which mechanism of cytotoxicity implicates calcium entry through L-type calcium channels, activation of MAPK/ERK, PKC and PI3K signaling as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species.
