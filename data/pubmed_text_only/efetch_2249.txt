Not all the risk factors for primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) are known. Appetite suppressants, including fenfluramine derivatives, are strongly suspected aetiological agents. In a 5 year retrospective study fenfluramine use was evaluated among patients referred to a medical centre specialising in the management of PPH. Fifteen (20%) of 73 patients with PPH had used fenfluramine: all of them were women and in 10 (67%) there was a close temporal relation between fenfluramine use and the development of exertional dyspnoea. Initial right heart catheterisation in the 15 women showed severe resting pulmonary hypertension (mean (SD)) with pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 57 (9) mm Hg, cardiac index 2.1 (0.5) l/min/m2, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 29 (10) U/m2. Short-term epoprostenol infusion produced a significant vasodilator response in 10 patients (mean fall in PVR 24 (15%) compared with control values). Three fenfluramine users with PPH showed spontaneous clinical and haemodynamic improvement 3, 6 and 12 months after drug withdrawal but there was no significant difference in overall survival (transplant recipients excluded) between fenfluramine users and controls. Histological examination of lung tissue from five women who had used fenfluramine and 22 controls, with PPH showed features typical of advanced plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy in all. These results do not accord with earlier reports that PPH associated with fenfluramine is less severe and has a better outcome. Fenfluramine may be one aetiological agent that can precipitate or hasten the development of PPH. The results of a European case-control study should give new insights into risk factors for PPH and the cause and effect relation with fenfluramine.
TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, has been recently reported to play an important role in tumorigenesis of human cancer through converting the early stage tumors into invasive malignancies. Upregulation of TWIST is often found in cancer patients, especially those with shorter survival period and poor response to chemotherapy. Here we studied the functions of TWIST on regulating migration rate, apoptosis, and gene expression in gastric cancer cells. TWIST expression is elevated in MGC-803 and HGC-27 cells that exhibit high invasive potential; whereas it is reduced in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells that possess relatively low invasive content. To evaluate functional consequences of TWIST induction, we examined the effect of TWIST on cell migration and apoptosis. Overexpression of TWIST in BGC-823 cells resulted in increased migration content and decreased sensitivity to the arsenic oxide-induced cell death. Moreover, small interference RNA-mediated TWIST ablation in MGC-803 and HGC-27 cells showed suppressed migration ability, increased induction of apoptosis in response to arsenic oxide, and elevated cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the TWIST level and p53 level, probably due to transcriptional regulation. Our results have identified TWIST as a critical regulator of gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach to inhibit the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer through inactivation of TWIST.
Eplerenone is a highly selective aldosterone blocker, which is under development for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. To assess its usefulness in older patients with systolic hypertension and widened pulse pressure, we compared the effects of eplerenone with amlodipine, on clinic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure and in a subset of the patients, ambulatory BP, vascular compliance, and urinary albumin excretion. The study involved 269 patients > or =50 years of age who were randomly assigned to either eplerenone (50 to 200 mg daily) or amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg daily) in a double-blind titration to effect design. After 24 weeks of therapy, reductions in clinic systolic BP were similar for both treatments (eplerenone, -20.5+/-1.1 mm Hg; amlodipine, -20.1+/-1.1 mm Hg). Reductions in clinic diastolic BP were modestly larger on amlodipine (-6.9+/-0.7 mm Hg) compared with eplerenone (-4.5+/-0.7 mm Hg) (P=0.014). Pulse pressure was also reduced similarly from baseline by the 2 treatment groups (eplerenone, -15.9 mm Hg versus amlodipine, -13.4 mm Hg, P=0.07). Changes from baseline in pulse wave velocity after 24 weeks of therapy were statistically similar for eplerenone and amlodipine. In patients with microalbuminuria at baseline (>30 mg albumin/g creatinine), eplerenone reduced the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio by 52% compared with a reduction of 10% by amlodipine (P=0.04). Thus, eplerenone was as effective as amlodipine in lowering systolic BP and pulse pressure as well as pulse wave velocity in older patients with widened pulse pressure hypertension. Furthermore, eplerenone reduced microalbuminuria to a greater extent than amlodipine in this older patient group.
Structures within the piriform cortex (PC) including the endopiriform nucleus (DEN) and pre-endopiriform nucleus (pEn) have been implicated to be involved in seizure genesis in models of temporal lobe epilepsy. We used stereological methods to examine the specificity and extent of neuron loss in the PC of pilocarpine-treated rats. Both 7 days and 2 months post-status epilepticus rats showed significant neuron loss in the pEn and DEN, layer III of the intermediate PC, and layers II and III of the caudal PC. Total losses in the PC were 40 and 46% in 7 days and 2 months post-status epilepticus rats, respectively (p<0.01). The numbers of parvalbumin (PV)- and cholecystokinin (CCK)-immunopositive neuron profiles significantly decreased, and somatostatin (SS)-immunopositive neuron profiles tended to decrease. A large decrease in the number of PV-immunopositive neuron profiles occurred in the pEn, adjoining parts of the DEN and deep layer III of the PC, portions of the DEN bordering the claustrum and agranular insular cortex, and layer III of the caudal PC. The regions with decreased numbers of PV-, CCK-, and SS-immunopositive neuron profiles overlapped with those where many Nissl-stained neurons were lost and many degenerating cell bodies were detected. These results suggest that the decreases in the numbers of PV/SS/CCK-immunopositive neurons are related to neuron loss rather than to a low rate of synthesis of their peptides or proteins.
Flecainide can "organise" atrial fibrillation into atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction, leading to cardiovascular compromise. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department is often complex and depends on several factors, including time of onset of atrial fibrillation and previously known cardiac disease. Current guidelines include flecainide as a possible treatment for chemical cardioversion and maintaining sinus rhythm in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.1 2 An important, under-recognised complication of flecainide is the transformation of rhythm from atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter. We present four such cases.
In this work we report the activity seen with combination therapy using sodium antimony gluconate in liposomes composed of egg phosphatidyl choline and stearylamine for elimination of Leishmania donovani parasites from the liver and spleen of BALB/c mice with established and chronic infections.
The search for molecular markers to improve diagnosis, individualize treatment and predict behavior of tumors has been the focus of several studies. This study aimed to analyze homeobox gene expression profile in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as well as to investigate whether some of these genes are relevant molecular markers of prognosis and/or tumor aggressiveness. Homeobox gene expression levels were assessed by microarrays and qRT-PCR in OSCC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous matched tissues (margin), as well as in OSCC cell lines. Analysis of microarray data revealed the expression of 147 homeobox genes, including one set of six at least 2-fold up-regulated, and another set of 34 at least 2-fold down-regulated homeobox genes in OSCC. After qRT-PCR assays, the three most up-regulated homeobox genes (HOXA5, HOXD10 and HOXD11) revealed higher and statistically significant expression levels in OSCC samples when compared to margins. Patients presenting lower expression of HOXA5 had poorer prognosis compared to those with higher expression (P=0.03). Additionally, the status of HOXA5, HOXD10 and HOXD11 expression levels in OSCC cell lines also showed a significant up-regulation when compared to normal oral keratinocytes. Results confirm the presence of three significantly upregulated (>4-fold) homeobox genes (HOXA5, HOXD10 and HOXD11) in OSCC that may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Moreover, since lower levels of HOXA5 predict poor prognosis, this gene may be a novel candidate for development of therapeutic strategies in OSCC.
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is caused by the cooperation of multiple oncogenic lesions. We used exome sequencing on 67 T-ALLs to gain insight into the mutational spectrum in these leukemias. We detected protein-altering mutations in 508 genes, with an average of 8.2 mutations in pediatric and 21.0 mutations in adult T-ALL. Using stringent filtering, we predict seven new oncogenic driver genes in T-ALL. We identify CNOT3 as a tumor suppressor mutated in 7 of 89 (7.9%) adult T-ALLs, and its knockdown causes tumors in a sensitized Drosophila melanogaster model. In addition, we identify mutations affecting the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL10 in 12 of 122 (9.8%) pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations of Arg98 in RPL10. Yeast and lymphoid cells expressing the RPL10 Arg98Ser mutant showed a ribosome biogenesis defect. Our data provide insights into the mutational landscape of pediatric versus adult T-ALL and identify the ribosome as a potential oncogenic factor.
Many individuals with multiple or large colorectal adenomas or early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) have no detectable germline mutations in the known cancer predisposition genes. Using whole-genome sequencing, supplemented by linkage and association analysis, we identified specific heterozygous POLE or POLD1 germline variants in several multiple-adenoma and/or CRC cases but in no controls. The variants associated with susceptibility, POLE p.Leu424Val and POLD1 p.Ser478Asn, have high penetrance, and POLD1 mutation was also associated with endometrial cancer predisposition. The mutations map to equivalent sites in the proofreading (exonuclease) domain of DNA polymerases ɛ and δ and are predicted to cause a defect in the correction of mispaired bases inserted during DNA replication. In agreement with this prediction, the tumors from mutation carriers were microsatellite stable but tended to acquire base substitution mutations, as confirmed by yeast functional assays. Further analysis of published data showed that the recently described group of hypermutant, microsatellite-stable CRCs is likely to be caused by somatic POLE mutations affecting the exonuclease domain.
The in vivo signal transduction pathway, responsible for isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy or remodeling, remains to be clarified. The purpose of this study was to examine c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NK-kappa B) DNA binding activity, which seem to be important in a signal transduction cascade upstream of the increased level of mRNA expression observed in isoproterenol-induced cardiac remodeling. Rats were continuously infused with saline and isoproterenol by intravenous injection (a short period; 0.5 microgram/kg/min) and an osmotic minipump (a long period; 0.5 or 3 mg/kg/day). Cardiac morphology was measured by echocardiography. JNK and ERK were measured by in gel kinase assay. AP-1 and NF-kappa B DNA binding activity was determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Echocardiogram showed that the thickness of the left ventricular anterior wall (AW) and left ventricular posterior wall (PW) increased at day 1 in low doses, and at day 1 in high doses. Isoproterenol significantly increased ERK and JNK activity at 15 min after intravenous infusion of 0.5 microgram/kg/min isoproterenol. At late phase about JNK and ERK activity, only a high dose of isoproterenol increased JNK. AP-1 DNA binding activities spurred by low or high doses of isoproterenol administration increased at 12 h, reached their peak of 24.1- and 37.1-fold (P < 0.01), respectively, at 24 h, and thereafter decreased. Although low doses of isoproterenol did not change the level of NF-kappa B DNA binding activities, high doses increased it to 10.9-fold (P < 0.01) at day 2. This study showed increased JNK, ERK, AP-1 and NF-kappa B DNA binding activities in isoproterenol-induced cardiac remodeling. AP-1 may contribute to the isoproterenol-induced cardiac remodeling, and JNK or NF-kappa B may also play some roles in it.
The neurotoxicity of the Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine is well recognized. Less recognized is laryngeal nerve paralysis induced by these chemotherapeutic agents. This potentially dangerous paralysis is usually reversible when the drug is withdrawn, but other causes of hoarseness in a cancer patient must be considered. I add two cases to 19 previously documented.
To examine the role of the cholinergic system in Tourette syndrome, we administered intramuscular physostigmine and scopolamine hydrobromide to 10 patients, evaluating both motor tics and involuntary vocalizations. Patients showed a consistent abatement of motor tics and exacerbation of vocal tics after scopolamine injection. The scopolamine effect was reversed by physostigmine. These data suggest that the cholinergic system plays a role in the pharmacologic pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome. The pharmacology of vocal and motor tics may differ, and cholinergic manipulation may benefit some patients.
Several halogenated anaesthetic agents have been associated with hepatotoxicity. We report a case of fulminant, fatal hepatic necrosis after uneventful isoflurane anaesthesia in a patient without previous liver disease, who may have been sensitised by previous exposure to enflurane. Although no anti-trifluoroacetyl antibodies could be detected in the patient's serum, isoflurane hepatotoxicity seems very likely to be the reason for fulminant hepatic failure in this patient.
The inhibitory activity of mangiferin (50 mg/kg/die and 100 mg/kg/die) on Cryptosporidium parvum was evaluated in a neonatal mouse model and its activity was compared with that of paromomycin (100 mg/kg/die). At 4 days of age, neonatal Swiss conventional outbred mice were experimentally infected by oral administration of 10(4) oocysts/animal of C. parvum and treated orally for 10 consecutive days, starting 7 days after the experimental infection. One group of mice was left untreated. To evaluate the efficacy of mangiferin, from euthanised mice, 3-mum-thick tissue sections of the intestine were stained with haematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid Schiff. Immunohistochemistry was also used by employing a monoclonal anti-C. parvum antibody. Oocysts were counted and results were expressed as mean oocysts number/intestine. Results obtained show that mangiferin at 100 mg/kg/die has a significant anticryptosporidial activity and that its activity is similar to that showed by the same dose (100 mg/kg/die) of paromomycin. However, both mangiferin and paromomycin were not able to completely inhibit intestinal colonization of C. parvum but only to reduce it. This reduction was calculated at over 80% for both mangiferin and paromomycin with respect to the untreated control. A significant activity was found also for mangiferin at 50 mg/kg/die only after the end of treatment.
An extended-release intramuscular formulation of naltrexone that provides sustained release of the drug over a 28-day period has been developed with the aim of improving treatment adherence in patients treated with naltrexone for alcohol dependence. Biodegradable polylactide-co-glycolide polymer microspheres containing 34% w/w naltrexone are reconstituted in an aqueous suspension just prior to intramuscular administration. Extended-release intramuscular naltrexone 380 mg administered once every 4 weeks, in combination with psychosocial therapy, demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo plus psychosocial therapy in reducing the heavy drinking event rate (primary endpoint) in adult patients with alcohol dependence in a 6-month well controlled trial. Among the subset of patients who abstained completely from drinking during the 7 days prior to the first dose of medication (n = 53; 8% of the total study population), those treated with extended-release intramuscular naltrexone 380 mg had greater reductions in the number of drinking days and the number of heavy drinking days compared with placebo recipients. Treatment with extended-release intramuscular naltrexone 380 mg once every 4 weeks for up to 18 months was generally well tolerated, with infrequent treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were nausea, injection site reaction and headache. The proportion of patients with clinically significant plasma transaminase elevations was not different between patients receiving extended-release intramuscular naltrexone and those receiving placebo.
Research from our laboratory has explored the role of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in cocaine reinforcement. These experiments were designed to determine the involvement of the HPA axis in extinction. Male Wistar rats were trained to self-administer cocaine [0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mg/kg/infusion (inf)] and food pellets (45 mg) under a multiple, alternating schedule of reinforcement. When self-administration was stable, saline was substituted for cocaine. Blood samples were taken at the end of the sessions following cocaine self-administration, the first exposure to saline substitution (first); and once the criteria for extinction were met (final). Plasma corticosterone was measured using radioimmunoassays. Although there was a significant increase in the number of infusions obtained during the first saline substitution test by rats trained with 0.5 mg/kg/inf of cocaine, there was a decrease in infusions received when 0.125 mg/kg/inf of cocaine was tested. Following repeated exposure to the extinction conditions, responding by rats trained to self-administer all three doses of cocaine was decreased to similar levels. In addition, there were significant differences in plasma corticosterone in rats trained with different doses of cocaine. Lever-pressing behavior and plasma corticosterone varied during extinction in relation to the training dose of cocaine and according to whether the rats had been exposed to single or repeated extinction testing. These data are discussed in terms of the potential difficulties involved in interpreting the effects of compounds intended to reduce drug reinforcement.
We treated a 13-year-old girl who developed myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-related crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) during propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment for Graves' disease. MPO-ANCA-related crescentic GN during PTU therapy has been described previously in only one recent report of 2 children. We report this case here and describe 15 (13 adult cases) more patients with MPO-ANCA-related GN associated with PTU found in a literature review. The mean age at onset was 41.3 years, and the length of PTU administration ranged from 2 weeks to 6 years (mean 3.5 years). Clinical signs and symptoms were hematuria (100%), proteinuria (100%), arthralgia (7 of 16 cases; 43.8%), fever (4 cases; 20.0%), purpura (2 cases; 12.5%), skin ulcer (1 case; 6.3%) and dyspnea (1 case; 6.3%). These patients were treated with steroid (15 cases; 93.8%), cyclophosphamide (8 cases; 50.0%), steroid pulse therapy (4 cases; 25.0%), or plasma exchange (1 case; 6.3%), or were not treated (1 case; 6.3%). Most patients revealed crescentic GN (15 cases; 93.8%) on renal biopsy, while one exhibited mesangial proliferative GN (6.3%). For 2 of the 16 patients (12.5%) irreversible renal dysfunction persisted and hemodialysis was started. Patients with Graves' disease treated with PTU should be observed carefully by urinalysis and monitoring of the serum creatinine level.
This study was designed to compare some behavioral and biochemical effects of chronic treatment with a range of antipsychotic drugs. Gene expression of enkephalin, chromogranin A, chromogranin B, and secretogranin II and their respective peptide products were studied with in situ hybridization and radioimmunoassays after daily oral administration of haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, or zotepine for 21 days. In behavioral tests, significant catalepsy was induced by haloperidol only. All four antipsychotic drugs increased hind paw retraction time but only haloperidol also increased forelimb retraction time. In the caudate putamen, haloperidol increased both enkephalin mRNA expression and enkephalin tissue levels. Neither of these parameters was altered by the other three drugs. In the prefrontal cortex, antipsychotic drugs generated a distinct pattern of gene expression in two regards. First, the dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist, haloperidol, did not significantly alter synaptic protein levels or their encoding mRNAs. Secondly, there was a differential change in tissue levels and mRNA expression since secretogranin II was not affected by any tested antipsychotic drug. This study shows that different types of antipsychotic drug induce distinct behavioural effects as well as differential changes in the biosynthesis of synaptic proteins and their encoding mRNAs. The data reinforce the notion that haloperidol can be classed as a typical antipsychotic drug whilst clozapine, zotepine, and risperidone reflect their atypical classification.
To investigate cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) gene expression in occurrence and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
The human liver arrayed library was spotted onto the nylon membranes to make cDNA array. Hybridization of cDNA array was performed with labeled probes synthesized from RNA isolated from HCC and adjacent liver tissues. Sprague-Dawley rats were administrated diethylnitrosamine (DENA) to induce HCC. CYP2E1 expression was detected by the method of RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis.
CYP2E1 was found by cDNA array hybridization to express differently between HCC and liver tissues. CYP2E1 only expressed in liver, but did not express in HCC tissues and expressed lowly in cirrhotic tissues. In the progression of cirrhosis and HCC, the expression level of CYP2E1 was gradually decreased and hardly detected until the late stage of HCC.
Using arrayed library to make cDNA arrays is an effective method to find differential expression genes. CYP2E1 is a unique gene expressing in liver but did not express in HCC. CYP2E1 expression descended along with the initiation and progression of HCC, which is noteworthy further investigations in its significance in the development of HCC.
Melittin, a water-soluble toxic peptide derived from bee venom of Apis mellifera was reported to have inhibitory effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its role in antimetastasis and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. By utilizing both HCC cell lines and an animal model based assay system, we found that Rac1, which has been shown to be involved in cancer cell metastasis, is highly expressed in aggressive HCC cell lines and its activity correlated with cell motility and cytoskeleton polymerization. In addition, Rac1-dependent activity and metastatic potential of aggressive HCC cells are remarkably high in both cellular and nude mouse models. We provide evidence here that melittin inhibits the viability and motility of HCC cells in vitro, which correlates with its suppression of Rac1-dependent activity, cell motility, and microfilament depolymerization. Furthermore, melittin suppresses both HCC metastasis and Rac1-dependent activity in nude mouse models. The specificity of the effect of melittin on Rac1 was confirmed in HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Melittin inhibits tumor cell metastasis by reducing cell motility and migration via the suppression of Rac1-dependent pathway, suggesting that melittin is a potential therapeutic agent for HCC.
Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP) is an alkaloid constituent of plants from the botanical genera Corydalis and Stephania and is contained in many traditional Chinese herbal preparations. In addition to its low-affinity antagonism of D2 dopamine (DA) receptors, we report that l-THP functions as a higher-affinity antagonist at D1 DA receptors and interacts with D3 DA receptors, suggesting that it may be effective for the treatment of drug addiction. Accordingly, l-THP has been reported to reduce heroin craving and relapse in recovering addicts.
This study investigated the effects of l-THP (3.75, 7.5, and 15.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on cocaine self-administration (SA) and cocaine-induced reinstatement.
Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine and food by pressing separate response levers during sessions consisting of a multiple schedule of alternating 30-min FR4 cocaine and 15-min FR4 food reinforcement. During the cocaine components of each session, the available cocaine dose varied such that rats had access to low and high dose ranges in varying sequence on alternating days. After SA, cocaine-reinforced responding was extinguished, and effects of l-THP on cocaine-induced reinstatement (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were examined.
l-THP produced a rightward and downward shift in the dose-response curve for cocaine SA and attenuated cocaine-induced reinstatement. l-THP also reduced food-reinforced responding and locomotor activity. However, reductions in cocaine SA were found at doses that failed to alter food-reinforced responding, and significant effects were not observed on food responding during reinstatement.
These findings suggest that l-THP is potentially useful for treating cocaine addiction.
Environmental exposure to arsenic is known to cause various cancers. There are some potential relationships between cell malignant transformation and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expressions. Metastasis, one of the major characteristics of malignantly transformed cells, contributes to the high mortality of cells. CXCR4 and its natural chemokine ligand C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12) play a critical role in metastasis. Therefore, identification of nutritional factors which are able to inhibit CXCR4 is important for protection from environmental arsenic-induced carcinogenesis and for abolishing metastasis of malignantly transformed cells. The present study demonstrates that apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), a natural dietary flavonoid, suppressed CXCR4 expression in arsenic-transformed Beas-2B cells (B-AsT) and several other types of transformed/cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Neither proteasome nor lysosome inhibitor had any effect in reducing the apigenin-induced down-regulation of CXCR4, indicating that apigenin-induced down-regulation of CXCR4 is not due to proteolytic degradation. The down-regulation of CXCR4 is mainly due to the inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. Apigenin also abolished migration and invasion of transformed cells induced by CXCL12. In a xenograft mouse model, apigenin down-regulated CXCR4 expression and suppressed tumor growth. Taken together, our results show that apigenin is a novel inhibitor of CXCR4 expression. This dietary flavonoid has the potential to suppress migration and invasion of transformed cells and prevent environmental arsenic-induced carcinogenesis.
In patients with unexplained pain after cholecystectomy, morphine often induces pain and may increase plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity because of exaggerated or prolonged rises in pressure within the biliary system. These anomalous effects of morphine may be mediated by activation of autonomic or related afferent nuclei. In this study, 16 patients with pain and increases in AST after morphine were further studied after pre-treatment with dexamethasone and hydrocortisone. Pre-treatment with dexamethasone decreased scores for pain and nausea and prevented or attenuated increases in plasma AST and glucose; these effects were not observed after pre-treatment with hydrocortisone. Serial changes in plasma concentrations of catecholamines were determined in 8 patients and showed that pre-treatment with dexamethasone, but not hydrocortisone, was associated with lower concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine with overall reductions of 53% and 67%, respectively. These observations are consistent with a role for sympatho-adrenomedullary activation in abdominal pain induced by morphine. The different effects of dexamethasone and hydrocortisone raise the possibility that sympatho-adrenomedullary activation after morphine is influenced by the interaction of cortisol with type I glucocorticoid receptors which have a low affinity for dexamethasone and a high affinity for cortisol.
