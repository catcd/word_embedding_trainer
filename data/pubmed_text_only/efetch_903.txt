Occupational exposure to vinyl chloride monomers is known to induce Raynaud's phenomenon, periportal fibrosis, liver angiosarcoma and scleroderma-like syndrome. We report the first case of occupational polymyositis in a 58-year-old man exposed to vinyl chloride. A dysimmune process was strongly suspected as having induced vinyl chloride disease. Our patient had an anti-histidyl-t-RNA-synthetase (Jo1) antibody, which has never to our knowledge been reported in this occupational disease.
Leptin and cholecystokinin (CCK) have a synergistic interaction in the suppression of food intake, and afford similar gastroprotective activity. The present study was designed to investigate the putative protective effects of CCK and leptin on acute colonic inflammation. Leptin or CCK-8s was injected to rats intraperitoneally immediately before and 6 h after the induction of colitis with acetic acid. CCK-A receptor antagonist (L-364,718) or CCK-B receptor antagonist (L-365,260) was injected intraperitoneally 15 min before leptin or CCK treatments. In a group of rats, vagal afferent fibers were denervated by topical application of capsaicin on the cervical vagi. Rats were decapitated at 24 h, and the distal 8 cm of the colon were removed for macroscopic scoring, determination of tissue wet weight index (WWI), histologic assessment and tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. All inflammation parameters were increased by acetic acid-induced colitis compared to control group. Leptin or CCK-8s treatment reduced these parameters in a similar manner, while co-administration of leptin and CCK was found to be more effective in reducing the macroscopic score and WWI. CCK-8s-induced reduction in the score and WWI was prevented by CCK-A, but not by CCK-B receptor antagonist, whereas neither antagonist altered the inhibitory effect of leptin on colitis-induced injury. On the other hand, perivagal capsaicin prevented the protective effects of both CCK-8s and leptin on colitis. Our results indicate that leptin and CCK have anti-inflammatory effects on acetic acid-induced colitis in rats, which appear to be mediated by capsaicin-sensitive vagal afferent fibers involving the reduction in colonic neutrophil infiltration.
Recent work indicates that PPARalpha is required for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)-induced postnatal lethality resulting from prenatal exposure. The present study tested the hypothesis that relatively modest activation of PPARalpha during prenatal development will cause postnatal lethality, similar to that observed with PFOA, a relatively low affinity PPARalpha agonist. Female wild-type and Pparalpha-null mice were mated overnight with males of the same genotype. The presence of a copulatory plug on the morning after mating was indicative of pregnancy and considered gestation day (GD) 0. Plugged female mice were fed either a control diet or one containing clofibrate (0.5%) or Wy-14,643 (0.005%) until GD18 or until parturition. Mice were examined on GD18 or on postnatal day (PND) 20 following the prenatal exposure period. Dietary administration of clofibrate or Wy-14,643 did not affect maternal weight or weight gain, the average number of implantations, the percentage of litter loss, the average number of live/dead fetuses, average crown-rump length, or the average fetal weight on GD18 in either genotype. An increase in relative maternal liver weight and elevated expression of PPARalpha target genes in maternal and fetal livers on GD18 were observed, indicative of PPARalpha-dependent changes in both the maternal and fetal compartments. However, no defects in postnatal development were observed by either clofibrate or Wy-14,643 in either genotype by PND20. These results demonstrate that relatively low level activation of PPARalpha by clofibrate or Wy-14,643 during prenatal development does not cause postnatal lethality.
Epidemiologic studies have linked dioxin exposure to increased mortality caused by ischemic heart disease. To test the hypothesis that dioxin exposure may constitute an environmental risk factor for atherosclerosis, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to 5 microg/kg of dioxin daily for 3 d, and measured various molecular and physiological markers of heart disease. Dioxin treatment led to an increase in the urinary excretion of vasoactive eicosanoids and an elevation in the mean tail-cuff blood pressure. In addition, dioxin exposure led to an increase in triglycerides, but not in high-density lipoproteins, in both Apoe(+/+) mice and in hyperlipidemic Apoe(-/- mice. Dioxin exposure also led to an increase in low-density lipoproteins in Apoe(-/-) mice. After treatment, dioxin was associated with low-density lipoprotein particles, which might serve as a vehicle to deliver the compound to atherosclerotic plaques. Dioxin treatment of vascular smooth-muscle cells taken from C57Bl/6J mice resulted in the deregulation of several genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Subchronic treatment of Apoe(-/-) mice with dioxin (150 ng/kg, three times weekly) for 7 or 26 wk caused a trend toward earlier onset and greater severity of atherosclerotic lesions compared to those of vehicle treated mice. These results suggest that dioxin may increase the incidence of ischemic heart disease by exacerbating its severity.
The authors examined an index of dopaminergic neurotransmission in recently abstinent cocaine-dependent patients.
CSF concentrations of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined in 30 recently abstinent cocaine-dependent patients and 69 healthy comparison subjects.
The cocaine-dependent patients had a significantly higher mean concentration of CSF HVA than did the healthy comparison group.
Recently abstinent cocaine-dependent patients may show dysregulation of the central dopaminergic system.
In traditional Chinese medicine, the flower of Pueraria lobata (Puerariae Flos) has been used in therapy to counteract the problems associated with alcohol drinking and liver injury. In this study, we investigated the hepatoprotective effects and its mechanisms of tectoridin, an isoflavone glycoside from the flower of P. lobata (Willd.) Ohwi. Ethanol (5g/kg) was given orally every 12h for a total of three doses. 1h after the last dose of ethanol, tectoridin (25, 50 and 100mg/kg) was given intragastrically five times in three consecutive days. The mice were sacrificed at 4h after tectoridin treatment. Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c and their target genes were evaluated by biochemical analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Mitochondria were isolated for the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) assay. Acute ethanol exposure resulted in the significant increase of the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and triglyceride (TG) levels and hepatic mitochondria dysfunction shown as the increase of MPT and the decrease of DeltaPsi(m). However, tectoridin treatment dramatically attenuated these effects. In addition, tectoridin remarkably alleviated the over-production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance. Furthermore, tectoridin inhibited the decrease of PPARalpha expression and its target genes, including medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and cytochrome P450 4A (CYP 4A) at mRNA and enzyme activity levels. These data showed that tectoridin protected against ethanol-induced liver steatosis mainly through modulating the disturbance of PPARalpha pathway and ameliorating mitochondrial function.
A 71-year-old woman with depression had been treated with an antidepressant (maprotiline) and antianxiety agents (clotiazepam and alprazolam). She had previously complained of ocular pain and blurred vision. However, thorough ocular examination was not performed at those times. On examination, visual acuity was no light perception OD and hand motion OS. Intraocular pressures were 33 mm Hg OU. Moderately dilated pupils, atrophic irises, shallow anterior chambers and closed angles were seen in both eyes. Despite treatment, her visual acuity decreased to no light perception bilaterally. Psychiatrists and ophthalmologists should be aware that antidepressants and antianxiety agents can precipitate angle closure glaucoma in susceptible eyes.
A 13-year old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had bilateral paresis of the upper extremities and aphasia 1 week after high dose methotrexate and triple intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, cytarabin, hydrocortisone). The stroke-like neurological symptoms disappeared on the third day. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensities of white matter on the second day. Despite resolution of the neurological symptoms, magnetic resonance images were still abnormal 3 years after the attack. Methotrexate has been considered to be responsible for ischemic damage to oligodendroglial cells, resulting in demyelination. The changes are occasionally prolonged without persistent neurologic symptoms.
In this review we present the effects of a well-known antianginal drug, prenylamine (PNL), in experimental models of acute myocardial damage induced by a beta-agonistic drug, isoproterenol (ISP), in several trials conducted in our laboratory in both rats (n = 204) and monkeys (n = 26). PNL significantly inhibited ISP-induced lesions, protecting the majority of animals studied. Studies dealing with the site of action of the drug, such as 45Ca, 3H-PNL and 3H-ISP trials, showed a clear membrane effect slowing down Ca transport. Correlation between ECG (inhibition of ST depression after ISP) and pathological findings in monkeys was also obtained in one of our experiments. These series of assays were useful in obtaining a more complete idea of activity and site of action of the drug. It seems that, in acute models, PNL acts as a calcium antagonistic drug rather than an adrenergic moderator.
Reinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with an unfavourable clinical course. Lamivudine/hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) combination treatment reduces reinfection rates. However, it is unclear at what time point lamivudine should be started and which HBIG doses are sufficient.
Twenty-one patients receiving combination treatment were studied. Lamivudine was started up to 16.5 months before OLT and continued thereafter. HBIG was started intraoperatively and continued according to anti-HBs-titers. Median follow-up after OLT was 20 months.
Eleven patients received lamivudine pretreatment for >2 (median 6) months due to initial HBV-DNA-positivity (median 749 pg/ml). After initial lamivudine response HBV-DNA increased in two of them to concentrations above 10 pg/ml prior to OLT. Both had developed mutations in the YMDD motif and suffered from HBV reinfection 13 and 75 days postoperatively. Individual HBIG consumption was highly variable (range 787-4,766 lU/month). Twenty-two percent of anti-HBs titers measured before HBIG administration were below 100 IU/l.
Combined reinfection prophylaxis with lamivudine and HBIG is effective in patients with controlled viral replication at the time of OLT. However, pretransplantation lamivudine resistance is a risk factor for reinfection. Low dose HBIG maintenance therapy individualized according to anti-HBs-titers appears to be tenable.
Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a potent immunosuppressant with a mechanism of action different from cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus.
In 11 European centers, first cadaveric renal allograft recipients were randomized to CsA (n=42) or sirolimus (n=41). Dosing of these agents was concentration-controlled and open-labeled. All patients received corticosteroids and azathioprine.
At 12 months, graft survival (98% sirolimus vs. 90% CsA), patient survival (100% vs. 98%), and incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (41% vs. 38%) were similar. Serum creatinine was lower with sirolimus, significantly (P< or =0.05) so at 3 and 4 months, and serum uric acid and magnesium were normal. Laboratory abnormalities reported significantly more often with sirolimus included hypertriglyceridemia (51% vs. 12%), hypercholesterolemia (44% vs. 14%), thrombocytopenia (37% vs. 0%), leukopenia (39% vs. 14%), and, of lesser importance, increased liver enzymes and hypokalemia. These abnormalities improved 2 months after transplantation when the sirolimus target trough level was lowered from 30 to 15 ng/ml. Occurrence of cytomegalovirus was comparable (14% vs. 12%); incidences of herpes simplex (24% vs. 10%, P=0.08) and pneumonia (17% vs. 2%, P=0.03) were higher with sirolimus. No gingival hyperplasia was seen with sirolimus, tremor was rare, and hypertension was less frequent (17% vs. 33%). Two malignancies were observed with CsA and none with sirolimus.
Results at 12 months suggest that sirolimus can be used as base therapy in the prophylaxis of acute renal transplant rejection, and has a safety profile that differs from CsA.
We have described a 22-year-old woman who manifested clinical seizures after treatment with lithium carbonate was initiated. Serial electroencephalograms showed both nonspecific activation and activation of an epileptiform discharge with serum levels of lithium carbonate maintained within the therapeutic range.
Ifosfamide is an important part of chemotherapeutic regimens used to treat a variety of malignancies. One potential side effect of the drug is encephalopathy, which may manifest itself as a variety of symptoms, ranging from agitation to seizures and coma. The goal of this review is to identify the prevalence of ifosfamide encephalopathy at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 1995 to 2003, and to identify risk factors associated with the condition.
A retrospective cohort study of all patients receiving ifosfamide at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, from late 1995 to early 2003 was performed. In sum, the authors reviewed chemotherapy administrations for a total of 237 individual patients. Patients were divided into control subjects and cases of encephalopathy.
A total of 237 patients received ifosfamide during the study period. Thirty-eight patients (16%) underwent chemotherapy rounds during which encephalopathy occurred. Serum albumin was significantly lower in the case population (3.3 g/dL) compared with the control population (3.7 g/dL). The odds ratio of hypoalbuminemia for the development of encephalopathy was calculated as 4.3 (CI, 2.26-8.3). The average creatinine values were in the normal range for both groups, although slightly higher in the case population with statistical significance. Age and ifosfamide dose were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The most common manifestation of encephalopathy was confusion. Methylene blue, which has been thought to reverse the condition, was administered in 26 cases.
The prevalence of ifosfamide encephalopathy during the study period was 16%. Albumin was significantly lower among those patients who experienced encephalopathy, whereas age, creatinine, and ifosfamide dose were not significantly different between the 2 groups.
Resveratrol and quercetin (RQ) in combination (1:1 ratio) previously inhibited growth in human leukemia cells. This study investigated the anticancer activity of the same mixture in HT-29 colon cancer cells. RQ decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by up to 2.25-fold and increased the antioxidant capacity by up to 3-fold in HT-29 cells (3.8-60 μg/mL), whereas IC50 values for viability were 18.13, 18.73, and 11.85 μg/mL, respectively. RQ also induced caspase-3-cleavage (2-fold) and increased PARP cleavage. Specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors are overexpressed in colon and other cancers and regulate genes required for cell proliferation survival and angiogenesis. RQ treatment decreased the expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 mRNA and this was accompanied by decreased protein expression. Moreover, the Sp-dependent antiapoptotic survival gene survivin was also significantly reduced, both at mRNA and protein levels. RQ decreased microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and induced zinc finger protein ZBTB10, an Sp-repressor, suggesting that interactions of RQ with the miR-27a-ZBTB10-axis play a role in Sp downregulation. This was confirmed by transfection of cells with the specific mimic for miR-27a, which partially reversed the effects of RQ. These findings are consistent with previous studies on botanical anticancer agents in colon cancer cells.
In patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease, the potential negative role of sulfonylurea drugs is under intensive investigation. We assessed the effects of treatment with glibenclamide or insulin on the extension of left ventricular myocardial dysfunction induced by acute ischemia. Nineteen consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease entered the study. Each patient was randomly assigned to either insulin or glibenclamide therapy. Treatment was crossed over after 12 weeks and maintained for another 12 weeks. At the end of each treatment, left ventricular myocardial function at rest and during dipyridamole infusion was studied by two-dimensional echocardiography under the same conditions of metabolic control. Glibenclamide or insulin treatment did not influence the rest values of left ventricular dimensions, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or wall motion score index (WMSI). Dipyridamole infusion, in patients receiving glibenclamide treatment, decreased LVEF (43 +/- 7 vs. 37 +/- 12%, P < 0.005) and increased WMSI (1.4 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.24, P < 0.001) compared with baseline values; during insulin treatment, LVEF (46 +/- 8 vs. 45 +/- 11%, NS) and WMSI (1.4 +/- 0.29 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.4, NS) did not change significantly. Peak stress LVEF was higher (45 +/- 11 vs. 37 +/- 12%, P < 0.001) and WMSI lower (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.24, P < 0.001) in patients receiving insulin. The results indicate that in patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, ischemic myocardial dysfunction induced by dipyridamole infusion is less severe during treatment with insulin than with glibenclamide. Restitution of a preconditioning mechanism in insulin-treated patients may be the potential beneficial mechanism.
An adult patient with severe tetanus was successfully treated with alternating long-term infusions of propofol (20-80 mg/h, 8 + 3 days) and midazolam (5-15 mg/h, 29 days) for sedation, and with vecuronium infusion (6-8 mg/h, 35 days) for muscle relaxation. In addition, continuous infusion of labetalol (10-20 mg/h, 39 days) was given to control arterial blood pressure. Blood samples were taken daily for assays of propofol, midazolam and vecuronium plasma concentrations. No accumulation of propofol and vecuronium could be detected. There was an increase in liver enzyme activity at the end of the first 8-day propofol infusion. During the 4-week midazolam infusion, there were two marked plasma concentration peaks at times when the infusion rate was fairly stable. These changes coincided with pulmonary infection (C-reactive protein elevated) and ciprofloxacin treatment. The patient awoke rapidly after the last propofol infusion. He was unable to recall anything about his stay in the intensive care unit.
Epileptogenesis in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is determined by several factors including abnormalities in the expression and function of ion channels. Here, we report a long-lasting deficit in gene expression of Kcnma1 coding for the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK, MaxiK) channel alpha-subunits after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. By using comparative real-time PCR, Taqman gene expression assays, and the delta-delta comparative threshold method we detected a significant reduction in Kcnma1 expression in microdissected dentate gyrus at different intervals after status epilepticus (24 h, 10 days, 1 month, and more than 2 months). BK channels are key regulators of neuronal excitability and transmitter release. Hence, defective Kcnma1 expression may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.
In agriculture, organophosphates are frequently used as insecticides and pesticides. These compounds decrease acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, thereby provoking an accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at synapses and resulting in the over-stimulation of acetylcholine receptors. Using trace paradigms, we investigated the effects of dimethoate, a widely used organophosphate insecticide, on the classical conditioning of eyelid responses, a hippocampal-dependent mouse model of associative learning. Mice were conditioned with a trace shock-SHOCK paradigm having first implanted stimulating electrodes in the supraorbitary nerve and recording electrodes in the ipsilateral orbicularis oculi muscle. When these mice were injected with dimethoate (5, 20, 50mg/kg/day) they were capable of acquiring associative learning, and the latency and amplitude of their unconditioned eyelid responses were unaffected by the administration of the pesticide. However, dimethoate administration led to the rapid extinction of conditioned responses, suggesting that this organophosphate accelerates the extinction of this form of associative learning. Analysis of the motor function of these mice using the rotarod performance test revealed that motor function and performance clearly deteriorated following dimethoate administration, with no improvements over the following 4 days. Together these findings indicate that dimethoate accelerates the extinction of acquired conditioned responses, affecting associative learning and memory, and it impairs motor function and performance in mice.
Human fetal kidney explants can be maintained during 5 days in Leibovitz's L15, a basic serum-free medium. Because culture conditions are minimal for growth and differentiation, DNA synthesis drastically decreases during the first 48 h, but stabilizes thereafter. The addition of insulin plus transferrin significantly restores this important cellular function in kidneys of fetuses younger than 16 wk. However, renal explants from older fetuses are more difficult to culture: they respond less to growth factors and are more prone to necrosis. The objective of this study was to verify the influence of tetracycline, an antibiotic with anti-collagenase potential, on cultured kidney explants aged 17 to 20 wk. The addition of 20 micrograms/ml tetracycline did not influence DNA synthesis nor the effectiveness of insulin plus transferrin on cell proliferation. Nor did it change the activities of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase, two enzymic markers of brush border differentiation. After 5 days in L15 alone, explants often showed necrosis and an important reduction in both weight and volume. Insulin plus transferrin significantly restored these parameters to control values observed at Day 0, but evidence of necrosis was still present. Tetracycline alone markedly reduced explant necrosis resulting in a significant increase in weight and volume. The effectiveness of insulin plus transferrin on explant morphometry was not improved when tetracycline was added as third factor. These results indicate that insulin plus transferrin restores explant mass through cell proliferation, whereas tetracycline does so possibly through a reduction in extracellular matrix degradation. The two effects are not additive in cultured mid-term fetal kidneys.
Oral tricyclic antidepressants, widely used as adjuncts in the treatment of chronic pain, block sodium channels in vitro and nerve conduction in vivo. However, toxicity of amitriptyline has been observed after neural application. We therefore investigated the mechanism and possible prevention of amitriptyline neurotoxicity. To assess dose-dependent neurotoxicity of amitriptyline, we incubated neuron cultures from adult rat dorsal root ganglia with amitriptyline and quantified neuronal survival. Additionally, we investigated accepted markers of apoptosis (mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic cytochrome c, and activated caspase-3) and co-incubated amitriptyline with an inhibitor of caspase activity, z-vad-fmk, to assess the effect on cell survival. We found a dose-dependent neurotoxic effect of amitriptyline. Neurons incubated with amitriptyline exhibited loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, and activation of caspase-3. Co-incubation with z-vad-fmk substantially improved neuronal survival in culture. In conclusion, amitriptyline-induced neurotoxicity is mediated by apoptosis and is attenuated by inhibition of caspase activity, suggesting that inhibition of apoptotic pathways may be efficient at alleviating local anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity. In vivo studies will have to corroborate whether the co-injection of anti-apoptotic drugs with local anesthetics decreases neurotoxic side effects.
Two patients who developed cholestatic liver disease after exposure to antibiotics are described. One patient who received clindamycin had liver biopsy findings of marked cholestasis, portal inflammation, bile duct injury and bile duct paucity (ductopenia). A second biopsy after clinical improvement showed resolution of cholestasis but persistence of duct paucity. Three years later, treatment with ampicillin caused another episode of cholestatic hepatitis with cholestasis and duct paucity on rebiopsy. The second patient, who developed cholestasis after receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, had marked duct paucity in the liver biopsy. This is the first description, to our knowledge, of ductopenia apparently caused by clindamycin. Cross-reactivity between clindamycin and ampicillin is also demonstrated in one patient. This report documents that duct paucity may occur within 10 days of onset of jaundice and appears to be confined to ducts less than 0.03 mm in diameter.
A 54-year-old women with quiescent acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) developed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was successfully treated with chlorambucil without any significant rise in urinary proto-porphyrins. The case is described and a review of chemotherapy use in AIP is presented.
A phase I study was designed to evaluate the toxicity of escalating doses of gemcitabine along with fixed-dose paclitaxel in patients heavily pretreated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. All patients had no prior therapy with the study drugs and possessed both adequate performance and end organ function. Eighteen patients were entered in the study. Characteristics included a median age of 66 years (range, 41 to 77) and stage IV disease in all patients; there were six patients with colon cancer, two with bladder cancer, three with non-small-cell lung cancer, two with esophageal cancer, three with pancreatic cancer, and two with cancer of unknown primary. Paclitaxel (150 mg/m2 over 3 hours) was given on day 1 and gemcitabine (800, 900, and 1,000 mg/m2 over 15 minutes) was given in three separate dose-escalating cohorts (1-3) on days 1 and 8. The treatment cycled every 21 days. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) proved to be neutropenia. All nonhematologic toxicities were mild and included gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), dermatologic (rash), and neurologic (paresthesias) disturbances along with transient elevations of liver function tests. The combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel seems to be well tolerated, and the recommended starting dose for a phase II study, in pretreated patients using a day 1/day 8 treatment schedule, should be 900 mg/m2 for gemcitabine (days 1 and 8) along with 150 mg/m2 for paclitaxel (day 1).
Tumor growth and metastasis depend on angiogenesis that requires the cofactor copper. Consistently, high levels of copper have been found in many types of human cancers, including prostate, breast, colon, and lung. Recent studies suggest that copper could be used as a novel selective target for cancer therapies. Clioquinol is capable of forming stable complexes with copper and currently used in clinics for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Most recently, it has been reported that clioquinol possesses antitumor effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. We report here that after binding to copper, clioquinol can inhibit the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity, repress androgen receptor (AR) protein expression, and induce apoptotic cell death in human prostate cancer LNCaP and C4-2B cells. In addition, clioquinol alone exhibits similar effects in prostate cancer cell lines with elevated copper at concentrations similar to those found in patients. Addition of dihydrotestosterone did not affect clioquinol-mediated proteasome inhibition in both prostate cancer cell lines. However, dihydrotestosterone partially inhibited clioquinol-induced AR suppression and apoptosis only in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Animal studies show that clioquinol treatment significantly inhibits the growth of human prostate tumor C4-2B xenografts (by 66%), associated with in vivo proteasome inhibition, AR protein repression, angiogenesis suppression, and apoptosis induction. Our study provides strong evidence that clioquinol is able to target tumor proteasome in vivo in a copper-dependent manner, resulting in formation of an active AR inhibitor and apoptosis inducer that is responsible for its observed antiprostate tumor effect.
We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer unresponsive to several chemotherapeutic and hormonal regimens. Because of progressive pulmonary metastases and a painful osteolytic metastasis in the sternum, treatment with docetaxel was initiated. She developed mesenteric venous thrombosis within 1 week after the first dose of docetaxel. Although docetaxel may be regarded as an important advancement in the chemotherapeutic treatment of several cancers, ongoing and future trials must assess its position in the standard chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. Well-documented adverse reactions, either common or rare, may contribute to a balanced risk-benefit profile of docetaxel.
From October 1995 to March 1997, a phase II trial of topotecan was carried out in chemotherapy-naive women with advanced, persistent, or recurrent uterine leiomyosarcomas. Thirty-six patients were entered. Median age was 53 years. Performance status was 0 (50%) in 18, 1 (36%) in 13, and 2 (14%) in 5. Most patients, 33 (92%), had undergone prior surgery, and 8 (22%) prior radiation therapy. Topotecan, 1.5 mg/m2. was administered intravenously daily for 5 days, every 3 weeks, until progression of disease or adverse affects prohibited further therapy. Patients received 1 to 13 courses with a median of 3 courses. The most frequent grade 4 adverse effects were neutropenia in 28 (78%), leukopenia in 8 (22%), thrombocytopenia in 3 (8%), and anemia in 3 (8%). Complete response was seen in 1 (3%), partial response in 3 (8%), stable disease in 12 (33%), and increasing tumor in 20 (56%). Thus topotecan at this dose and schedule does not appear to have major activity in uterine leiomyosarcomas.
Renal fibrosis acts as the common pathway leading to the development of end-stage renal disease. The present study investigated, in vivo and in vitro, the anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects, particularly on the epithelial to mesenchymal transition of renal tubular cells, exerted by honokiol, a phytochemical used in traditional medicine, and mechanisms underlying these effects.
Anti-fibrotic effects in vivo were assayed in a rat model of renal fibrosis [the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model]. A rat tubular epithelial cell line (NRK-52E) was stimulated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and treated with honokiol to explore possible mechanisms of these anti-fibrotic effects. Gene or protein expression was analysed by Northern or Western blotting. Transcriptional regulation was investigated using luciferase activity driven by a connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) promoter.
Honokiol slowed development of renal fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro. Honokiol treatment attenuated tubulointerstitial fibrosis and expression of pro-fibrotic factors in the UUO model. Honokiol also decreased expression of the mRNA for the chemokine CCL2 and for the intracellular adhesion molecule-1, as well as accumulation of type I (α1) collagen and fibronectin in UUO kidneys. Phosphorylation of Smad-2/3 induced by TGF-β1 and CTGF luciferase activity in renal tubular cells were also inhibited by honokiol.
Honokiol suppressed expression of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory factors and of extracellular matrix proteins. Honokiol may become a therapeutic agent to prevent renal fibrosis.
Multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2) is involved in the transport of antiepileptic drugs and is upregulated in the brain tissues of patients with epilepsy. Therefore, genetic variations in the MRP2 gene may affect individual drug responses to the antiepileptic agent carbamazepine.
Associations between MRP2 polymorphisms and the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of carbamazepine were analyzed using an integrated population genetics and molecular functional approach. In the initial case-control study, five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in the MRP2 gene were analyzed in 146 patients with epilepsy. Patients were divided into two groups: those who experienced ADRs of the central nervous system and those who did not. An independent replication study was performed using DNA samples from 279 patients.
A nonsynonymous polymorphism, c.1249G>A (p.V417I, rs2273697), showed a strong association with the neurological ADR caused by carbamazepine (P=0.005). Logistic regression analysis with multiple clinical variables indicated that the presence of A allele at the MRP2 c.1249G>A locus was an independent determinant of central nervous system ADR caused by carbamazepine. Moreover, the positive association of c.1249A was reproduced in the replication study (P=0.042, joint P value of the replication=0.001). The functional study using ATPase assay and FACScan flow cytometer indicated that carbamazepine was a substrate of MRP2 and that the 417I variation selectively reduced carbamazepine transport across the cell membrane.
These results strongly suggest that the A-allele of the MRP2 single nucleotide polymorphism c.1247G>A is associated with adverse neurological drug reactions to carbamazepine.
