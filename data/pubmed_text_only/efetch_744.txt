The intravenous rapid-injection of nitroglycerin in the resting conscious dog induced arterial hypotension followed by reflex tachycardia. The experiments were performed before and after cold vagal blockade. When vagus nerve was blocked hypotension was more pronounced than in control conditions, but the rise of heart rate was lower and occurred later. This result suggests that, in the conscious dog, hypotension induced reflex tachycardia is due to a decrease in vagal tone, as well as to an increase in sympathetic activity. It is conceivable that the decrease in vagal tone occurs earlier than the sympathetic activity increase. Therefore the short latency reflex inhibition of vagal tone, through early positive inotropic effects, probably plays a relevant role in buffering rapid decreases in arterial pressure.
WNDP (Wilson's disease protein) is a copper-transporting ATPase that plays an essential role in human physiology. Mutations in WNDP result in copper accumulation in tissues and cause a severe hepato-neurological disorder known as Wilson's disease. Several mutations were surmised to affect the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by WNDP; however, how the nucleotides bind to normal and mutated WNDP remains unknown. To aid such studies, we performed the molecular modelling of the spatial structure and dynamics of the ATP-binding domain of WNDP and its interactions with ATP. The three-dimensional models of this domain in two conformations were built using the X-ray structures of the Ca2+-ATPase in the E1 and E2 states. To study the functional aspects of the models, they were subjected to long-term molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit solvent; similar calculations were performed for the ATP-binding domain of Ca2+-ATPase. In both cases, we found large-scale motions that lead to significant changes of distances between several functionally important residues. The ATP docking revealed two possible modes of ATP binding: via adenosine buried in the cleft near residues H1069, R1151 and D1164, and via phosphate moiety 'anchored' by H-bonds with residues in the vicinity of catalytic D1027. Furthermore, interaction of ATP with both sites occurs if they are spatially close to each other. This may be achieved after relative domain motions of the 'closure' type observed in molecular dynamics simulations. The results provide a framework for analysis of disease mutations and for future mutagenesis studies.
Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine has been associated with severe and fatal cutaneous reactions as well as transient liver damage. We report the case of a patient who died of progressive hepatic failure caused by pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine administration. In addition, we summarize reports made to the Food and Drug Administration since 1982 that focus on hepatotoxic reactions to pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine. We suggest that fatal hepatic injury can occur after treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine and that physicians who prescribe the drug should be aware of this possibility.
A 37-year old patient, HIV-1-infected, consulted for progressive weakness and dyspnea on exertion, increasing over three months. Complete blood count showed pancytopenia, while the bone marrow revealed severe hypoplasia. Other investigations, including serology for CMV, vitamin levels, Coombs test, gastroscopy and colonoscopy were non contributing. A diagnosis of zidovudine-induced medullary aplasia was made; the clinical course was favourable after this drug was replaced by triple therapy. The authors discuss the differential diagnosis of cytopenias in the patient infected by HIV and they suggest a diagnostic approach.
In the present study we have investigated the effects of compounds which increase synaptic levels of noradrenaline on cocaine-induced seizures and lethality in mice. The noradrenaline uptake blocker desipramine (0.3, 3, 30 mg/kg i.p.; 1h pretreatment) and the alpha 2-antagonists idazoxan (0.05, 0.5, 5 mg/kg i.p.; 15 min) and RX811059A (0.01, 0.1, 1 mg/kg i.p.; 15 min) neither reduced nor increased the number of animals having convulsions in the 10 min following administration of cocaine (45, 60 mg/kg i.p.). None of these drugs increased lethality when assessed 10 minutes after 60 mg/kg cocaine and the alpha 2-antagonists did not protect against the lethal effects of a 90 mg/kg dose. On the other hand, desipramine significantly reduced the number of animals dying after this high dose of cocaine. These results suggest that noradrenergic mechanisms do not promote cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality - an important observation in light of the growing use of desipramine for initiation of abstinence in cocaine-dependent outpatients.
The major limiting factor in long-term administration of doxorubicin is the development of cumulative dose-dependent cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Although several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the exact cause of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, the role of the vascular endothelium-derived vasoactive mediators in the pathophysiology of this toxic effect is still unknown. Accordingly, the present study has been initiated to investigate whether the changes in plasma level of endothelin-1 and nitric oxide along with cardiac nitric oxide are associated with the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Doxorubicin was injected with a single dose of 5 mg/kg and every other day with a dose of 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, to have four cumulative doses of, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg/kg in five separate groups of male rats. An additional group receiving a single dose of 20 mg/kg and one receiving normal saline were also included in the study. Twenty-four hr after the last dose, the animals were sacrificed and the plasma levels of endothelin-1 and nitric oxide in addition to cardiac nitric oxide were determined. The results show that doxorubicin caused a statistically significant increase of 85%, 76% and 97% in plasma endothelin-1 at a cumulative dose levels of 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. However, the level of plasma nitric oxide remained unchanged. Furthermore, doxorubicin treatment resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase. In contrast, the increase in nitric oxide production in cardiac tissue by doxorubicin was not dose-dependent with the maximum increase (81%) at a cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg. It is worth mentioning that plasma endothelin-1 and cardiac nitric oxide were significantly increased at 24 hr after the single dose of 20 mg/kg doxorubicin. The increase of plasma endothelin-1 and cardiac nitric oxide with the cardiomyopathy enzymatic indices, may point to the conclusion that both endothelin-1 and cardiac nitric oxide are increased during the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Organophosphorus-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a syndrome induced by certain organophosphorus compounds (OPs) through a mechanism based on the inhibition and further modification (aging) of neuropathy target esterase (NTE). OECD guidelines for testing the capability of OPs to trigger OPIDP include two in vivo tests with hens. Activities of acetylcholinesterase and NTE found in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were inhibited by 10 different OPs with kinetics similar to those found with chicken brain enzymes (model system for in vivo and in vitro-ex vivo assays). NTE in SH-SY5Y cells inhibited by these OPs aged and reactivated similarly to that described for hen brain NTE ex vivo. In short, we have developed an alternative methodology for predicting the capability of OPs to induce OPIDP based on the inhibition kinetics of acetylcholinesterase and NTE and on the capability of OPs to age the inhibited NTE from SH-SY5Y cell line. The results obtained always agreed with the previously reported ex vivo results with hen brain. The developed methodology correctly predicted the neuropathic potential of the tested OPs in eight cases. The in vivo-in vitro discrepancies with two of the tested compounds can be explained on the basis of differences between in vivo and in vitro biotransformation.
In view of growing number of pathogenic microbial strain resistant to routine antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides become promising agents for the therapy of infectious diseases. We studied in vivo effects of melittin, an antimicrobial peptide expressed in a recombinant plasmid vector, on infection with urogenital pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. We obtained recombinant plasmid constructs, where melittin gene is under the control of tetracycline-dependent human cytomegalovirus promoter. Inhibition of experimental C. trachomatis, M. hominis, and M. gallisepticum infection after administration of recombinant plasmid vectors expressing melittin gene to BALB/c mice was demonstrated.
We report on an open-label, naturalistic study using risperidone to treat disruptive behaviors and self-injury in children with Down syndrome, severe intellectual disability, and comorbid autism spectrum disorders (DS+ASDs). We hypothesized that hyperactivity and disruptive behaviors would improve in response to risperidone treatment consistent with previous studies of children with ASD.
Subjects were children (mean age, 7.8 +/- 2.6 years), consisting of 20 males and three females identified through our outpatient Down Syndrome Clinic between 2000 and 2004.
Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist as the primary outcome measure, all five subscales showed significant improvement following risperidone treatment. The mean duration of treatment was 95.8 +/- 16.8 days, and mean total daily dose was 0.66 +/- 0.28 mg/day. The Hyperactivity, Stereotypy, and Lethargy subscale scores showed the most significant reduction (p < .001), followed by Irritability (p < .02), and Inappropriate Speech (p < .04). Children with disruptive behavior and self-injury showed the greatest improvement. Sleep quality improved for 88% of subjects with preexisting sleep disturbance. Subjects for whom a follow-up weight was available showed a mean weight increase of 2.8 +/- 1.5 kg during the treatment period.
These findings support our clinical impression of improvement on important target behaviors such as aggression, disruptiveness, self-injury, stereotypy, and social withdrawal. Low-dose risperidone appears to be well tolerated in children with DS+ASD, although concerns about weight gain and metabolic alterations may limit its usefulness over the long term in some children.
This study examined the role of hippocampal dopamine D2 receptors in the genesis of limbic seizures induced by muscarinic agonists in the rat. Pilocarpine, 600 mg/kg, elicited rapid and usually fatal convulsions. These were not affected by focal injections of saline (1 microliter) into both hippocampi. Pretreatment of the dorsal, but not the lateral hippocampus, with the D2 agonist trans-(+)-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-5-propyl-2H-pyrazolo-(3,4-g)quinol ine hydrochloride (LY 171555, 2 micrograms per side), did not alter the frequency of pilocarpine-induced convulsions, but significantly delayed their appearance and reduced their intensity. LY 171555 similarly increased the latency of seizures induced by focal hippocampal injection of carbachol (100 micrograms), without changing the frequency or the severity. The selective D2 antagonist raclopride, injected dorsally into both hippocampi dose-dependently facilitated motor seizures evoked by pilocarpine (100 mg/kg), the cholinomimetic at this dose being ineffective as a convulsant in saline-treated animals. Intrahippocampal administration of the D1 agonist 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SKF 38393, 2 micrograms per side) did not facilitate pilocarpine seizures and did not potentiate the proconvulsant action of raclopride. These data demonstrate that activation of the dopaminergic system, via D2 receptors in the dorsal hippocampus, is capable of protecting the animal against limbic motor seizures arising from excessive muscarinic stimulation of the hippocampus. Since the blockade of D2 receptors in the hippocampus markedly lowered the seizure threshold to pilocarpine, this would suggest that the dopaminergic input to the hippocampus is normally tonically active and functions physiologically to prevent epileptogenesis.
Currently available treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) are restricted to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which exhibit numerous side effects and are only temporarily effective. Thus novel, safe and more efficacious anti-inflammatory agents are needed for OA. Naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds, such as curcumin and resveratrol, are potent agents for modulating inflammation. Both compounds mediate their effects by targeting the NF-kappaB signalling pathway.
We have recently demonstrated that in chondrocytes resveratrol modulates the NF-kappaB pathway by inhibiting the proteasome, while curcumin modulates the activation of NF-kappaB by inhibiting upstream kinases (Akt). However, the combinational effects of these compounds in chondrocytes has not been studied and/or compared with their individual effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential synergistic effects of curcumin and resveratrol on IL-1beta-stimulated human chondrocytes in vitro using immunoblotting and electron microscopy.
Treatment with curcumin and resveratrol suppressed NF-kappaB-regulated gene products involved in inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor), inhibited apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and TNF-alpha receptor-associated factor 1) and prevented activation of caspase-3. IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activation was suppressed directly by cocktails of curcumin and resveratrol through inhibition of Ikappakappa and proteasome activation, inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, and inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. The modulatory effects of curcumin and resveratrol on IL-1beta-induced expression of cartilage specific matrix and proinflammatory enzymes were mediated in part by the cartilage-specific transcription factor Sox-9.
We propose that combining these natural compounds may be a useful strategy in OA therapy as compared with separate treatment with each individual compound.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are known to attenuate the effects of some antihypertensive agents. However, the effect these drugs have on leukocyte migration when combined with antihypertensive agents has not been studied. To investigate this effect, we treated spontaneously hypertensive rats with saline, diclofenac, enalapril, or diclofenac combined with enalapril and observed leukocyte-endothelium interaction. Blood pressure was increased by diclofenac, reduced by enalapril and reduced by the combination of the two. Diclofenac did not interfere with the blood pressure-lowering effect of enalapril. Internal spermatic fascia venules were observed using intravital microscopy. Diclofenac reduced rollers, whereas enalapril, alone or combined with diclofenac, had no significant effect on rollers. All treatments reduced adherent and migrated leukocytes and expression of endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Venular shear rate, venular diameters, number of circulating leukocytes, and post-leukotriene B4 expression of l-selectin and CD11/CD18 integrin in leukocytes were unaffected by any treatment. Expression of P-selectin was reduced by diclofenac and unaffected by enalapril, even when combined with diclofenac. Our data suggest that, although diclofenac does not interfere with the enalapril anti-hypertensive effect, enalapril interferes with the effect diclofenac has on leukocyte rolling and endothelial P-selectin expression. Involvement of reduced endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression might explain the lower numbers of adherent and migrated leukocytes. The anti-inflammatory properties of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug could therefore be attenuated in hypertensive patients receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.
To investigate the effects and mechanisms of Yishen Huoxue decoction (YHD) on chronic renal failure (CRF) rats induced by 5/6 nephrectomy.
The glomerulosclerosis model was established by 5/6 nephrectomy in rats. Experimental animals were allocated into the normal group, the model group, the YHD group and the benazepril group. Urine protein of 24 h (UP) at the 6th and 12th weekend after operation, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (SCr), albumin (Alb) and haemoglobin (HB) at the 12th weekend were measured, renal pathology changes were examined with light microscope, the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and fibronectin (Fn) were examined by immunohistochemistry and mRNA expressions of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by RT-PCR at the 12th weekend.
Compared with those in the normal group, the levels of UP, BUN and SCr, the area of glomerular mesangial matrix, the FN deposition, PCNA expression in glomeruli and tubular interstitium and mRNA expressions of CTGF and PAI-1 were all significantly higher in the model group (P < 0.05). All the above-mentioned indexes were lower in the YHD group than those in the model group (P < 0.05). PCNA positively expressed cells in glomeruli of the normal, model group, YHD group and benazepril group was 7.00 +/- 2.24,34.78 +/- 6.96,15.75 +/- 2.61 and 15.50 +/- 2.57 respectively, positively correlated to the expression of CTGF, PAI-1, FN and SCr level.
YHD could delay the progression of CRF in 5/6 nephrectomized rats, and the mechanisms were mainly related to the inhibition on renal cell proliferation and it induced over-expression of cytokines, and accumulation of extracellular matrix.
A case is reported of water intoxication and cardiac conduction disturbances occurring as a late complication of carbamazepine therapy for trigeminal neuralgia. These uncommon but potentially hazardous complications of therapy are reported because of the wide use of carbamazepine as the agent of choice for trigeminal neuralgia and as an anticonvulsant.
Three dialysis patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis developed confusion 4-14 days after commencement of treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs, despite the use of prophylactic pyridoxine. Full recovery of conscious state resulted within 1 week in all patients after stopping isoniazid. In 2 patients confusion recurred on rechallenge of the drug. The risk factors of isoniazid induced encephalopathy and the dosage of isoniazid in uraemic patients were discussed.
The ultrastructural appearance of the myocardium in a fatal case of paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity is reported, which includes swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, loss of myofibrils, and accumulation of lipofuscin as well as laminated myelinoid figures. Such changes are very similar to those seen in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and may suggest a pathogenetic final common pathway. While endomyocardial biopsy is a recognized means of monitoring anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, whether more liberal use of endomyocardial biopsy can prevent fatal cases of paclitaxel-induced cardiotoxicity needs to be further assessed.
Familial hyperproinsulinemia is characterized by the accumulation of proinsulin-like material (PLM) in the plasma of affected patients. This disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The accumulation of PLM is thought to be due to the impaired conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Although PLM has been suggested to have an amino acid substitution, it has been impossible to locate and identify a substituted amino acid, due to the difficulty in isolating sufficient amounts of PLM from plasma samples. Therefore, we analyzed leukocyte DNA from one member of a proinsulinemic family, and we found a point mutation that changed guanine to adenine in the insulin gene. This transition implies that a substitution of histidine for arginine has occurred at amino acid position 65. Furthermore, it indicates that arginine at 65 is essential for the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which disease can be incurred: a heritable disorder can result from a posttranslational processing abnormality caused by a point mutation.
Diabetes is an endocrine and metabolic disorder often associated with erectile dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy. Among other factors, penile erection is induced by activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei neurons produce NO and project to spinal cord areas implicated in penile reflexes. These nuclei have shown an increase of NOS in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. NOS-containing neurons are identical to the populations of neurons selectively stained for NADPH-diaphorase activity. Using this technique, we have evaluated changes of NOS in the lumbar spinal cord of diabetic rats with or without insulin treatment. Positive staining was found in motoneurons, dorsal horn neurons (layer II), neurons surrounding the ependimus (layer X) and neurons at the intermediolateral cell column (ILCC). Diabetic animals showed significant decrease in reactive area and increase of the histochemical reaction in motoneurons from the sexual dimorphic nuclei and in neurons of the ILCC. A marked decrease of the number of reactive neurons was also observed in layer II. Morphologic alterations were observed in neurons of layer X as an increase in the percentage of multipolar neurons and a decrease in the number and length of secondary processes. The alterations observed in these animals were absent in the insulin treated diabetic animals. These results show the plasticity of lumbar spinal cord neurons, suggesting a direct participation of NO synthesis in the physiopathology of the erection dysfunction in diabetes.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most unconcealed neurodegenerative disorder labelled with motor impairments. Two pesticides, manganese ethylene-1,2-bisdithiocarbamate (maneb) and 1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride (paraquat), together, are reported to increase the incidence of PD in humans and Parkinsonism in mice. Conversely, silymarin and melatonin, two naturally occurring antioxidants, rescue from maneb- and paraquat-induced Parkinsonism. The study examined silymarin- and melatonin-mediated changes in the expression of selected genes in maneb- and paraquat-induced Parkinsonism employing mouse discover chips microarrays. The mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.), daily, with silymarin (40 mg/kg) or melatonin (30 mg/kg) for 9 weeks along with vehicles. Subsets of animals were also treated with maneb (30 mg/kg; i.p.) and paraquat (10 mg/kg; i.p.), twice a week, for 9 weeks. Whilst the expression of genes in the striatum was determined by microarray, the expression of randomly selected transcripts was validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Combined maneb- and paraquat-treatment altered the expression of several genes associated with apoptosis, inflammation, cell cycle, cell-signalling, etc. pathways. Silymarin and melatonin significantly resisted the changes in the expression of a few genes related to apoptosis, inflammation, cell cycle, cell-signalling, etc. The expression patterns of seven randomly selected genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR, which were found to follow the similar trends, as observed with microarray. The results obtained from the study thus demonstrate that despite resemblances, silymarin and melatonin differentially offset maneb- and paraquat-induced changes in transcriptome.
Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a naturally occurring phytoalexin found in grapes and wine, and has been reported to exert a variety of important pharmacological effects. We have investigated the activity of resveratrol on proliferation and differentiation of the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4. The growth inhibitory properties of resveratrol appear to be due to its induction of apoptotic cell death, as determined by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, increased proportion of the subdiploid cell population and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)). Colorimetric assay for activity of caspase-3 showed an obvious increase in caspase-3 activity in cells after treatment with resveratrol. However, the expression levels of protein Bcl-2 and Bax show no significant change in response to resveratrol treatment. These results suggest that apoptosis of NB4 cells induced by resveratrol requires caspase-3 activation and is related to the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The combination of resveratrol and all-tran-retinoic acid (ATRA) induced 100% of the NB4 cells to become NBT-positive, whereas only a small part of cells became positive for NBT after a similar exposure to either resveratrol or ATRA alone. Thus, resveratrol may be useful in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia.
A case is reported of methotrexate leukoencephalopathy presenting as an intracerebral rim-enhancing mass lesion of CT scan. The implications of this rare presentation of methotrexate leukoencephalopathy for therapy are discussed.
This study was conducted to investigate whether hypertension induced by long-term in vivo administration of dexamethasone in rats could be prevented by the newly synthesized potent antiglucocorticoid drug RU 486. Subcutaneous implantation of 5 mg of dexamethasone pellets in Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in a rapid increase in the blood pressure that remained elevated during the 3 wk of experimental observation. RU 486 (50 mg) administered alone surprisingly showed slight elevation of blood pressure over untreated control animals. However, the blood pressure leveled off to control levels over the next 2 wk. Interestingly, a 50-mg RU 486 pellet implanted along with 5 mg of dexamethasone effectively prevented the dexamethasone-induced increase in blood pressure. RU 486 administered together with dexamethasone prevented dexamethasone-induced diuresis and urinary Na+ excretion. However, RU 486 was unable to reverse the weight loss or involution of thymus observed by long-term treatment with dexamethasone alone. No abnormalities were found in either kidneys or hearts in any of the treated groups under microscopic examination. These results suggest that RU 486 successfully prevented the hypertension produced by the long-term administration of dexamethasone in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
To estimate and stratify the risk of development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in well-defined at-risk subpopulations from a large single institution, and to perform a single-institution case series study of patients with biopsy-proven NSF.
Retrospective cohort of patients exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) at a single institution during an 8-year period (January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2006), and a case series study of patients with biopsy-proven NSF.
A primary, secondary, and tertiary health care center that treated more than 2.2 million outpatients and had 135 000 hospital admissions in 2007. Patients A total of 94 917 patients exposed to GBCAs; patients at risk for NSF (3779 patients on hemodialysis, 1694 patients with renal transplants, and 717 patients with liver transplants, a well-defined subgroup that includes patients at risk for reduced renal function); and 61 patients with a clinical diagnosis of NSF.
Risk estimate for NSF.
The risk of development of NSF is 1.0% for patients who undergo hemodialysis (8 of 827), 0.8% for patients with renal transplantation (4 of 527), and 0% for patients with liver transplantation at our institution (0 of 327).
Despite the limitations, this study, which reviewed a large number of patients who underwent intravascular GBCA injections, demonstrates a 77-fold higher risk of NSF among patients who undergo hemodialysis and a 69-fold higher risk in patients with renal transplantation. This increased risk is thought to be associated with poor clearance of most GBCAs.
The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effects of Danshen (DS, Salvia miltiorrhiza) on adriamycin (ADR)-induced cardiac and hepatic toxicity. Wistar rats were divided into six groups: control group, 10 animals received saline (i.p.); 15 animals received ADR (3 mg/kg, i.p.) three times weekly, for 2 weeks; 10 animals each received DS(1) (20 mg/kg, oral) and DS(2) (100 mg/kg, oral) for 30 days; 15 animals each received DS(1) + ADR and DS(2) + ADR. The ADR-induced cardiac and hepatic toxicity and protective action of DS were determined and quantitated with the use of hemodynamic measurements, biochemical analyses of serum, synthesis rates of DNA, RNA and protein, myocardial antioxidants, lipid peroxidation and histopathological procedure. Liver function was damaged. Nucleic acid as well as protein synthesis was inhibited, while lipid peroxidation was increased. Myocardial glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activity and superoxide dismutase activities (SOD) were decreased and histopathology revealed myocardial lesions indicative of ADR-induced cardiac and hepatic toxicity. In contrast, administration of DS before and concurrent with ADR significantly attenuated these effects. In conclusion, DS is potentially protective against ADR-induced cardiac and hepatic toxicity.
This is a case report of a 66-year-old female who had been taking coumadin for 4 weeks for deep vein thrombosis. She developed acute carpal tunnel syndrome following minor trauma to her wrist. After conservative therapy failed to relieve her symptoms she underwent release of her carpal tunnel with resolution of her symptoms. While there are many patients taking coumadin, its association with acute carpal tunnel syndrome is quite rare: we were only able to find only one other reported case in the literature. While one is tempted to treat these patients conservatively, operative therapy may be indicated.
