Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that narcolepsy with cataplexy is an autoimmune disease. We here report genome-wide association analyses for narcolepsy with replication and fine mapping across three ethnic groups (3,406 individuals of European ancestry, 2,414 Asians and 302 African Americans). We identify a SNP in the 3' untranslated region of P2RY11, the purinergic receptor subtype P2Y₁₁ gene, which is associated with narcolepsy (rs2305795, combined P = 6.1 × 10⁻¹⁰, odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39, n = 5689). The disease-associated allele is correlated with reduced expression of P2RY11 in CD8(+) T lymphocytes (339% reduced, P = 0.003) and natural killer (NK) cells (P = 0.031), but not in other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. The low expression variant is also associated with reduced P2RY11-mediated resistance to ATP-induced cell death in T lymphocytes (P = 0.0007) and natural killer cells (P = 0.001). These results identify P2RY11 as an important regulator of immune-cell survival, with possible implications in narcolepsy and other autoimmune diseases.
Glufosfamide is an alkylating agent consisting of iphosphoramide mustard conjugated to glucose that is currently included in clinical studies of pancreatic cancer. We studied the effects of glufosfamide, in combination with gemcitabine, on in vitro and in vivo models of pancreatic cancer. In proliferation assays, glufosfamide and gemcitabine inhibited the growth of MiaPaCa-2, H766t, and PANC-1 cells, but the combination of the two agents provided greater effects. Apoptosis of MiaPaCa-2 cells, measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, was enhanced by the combination of the two drugs, compared to single-agent treatment. Glufosfamide alone inhibited the growth of red fluorescent protein-expressing MiaPaCa-2 tumors in an orthotopic nude mouse model in a dose-dependent manner. Combining glufosfamide (30 mg/kg) with gemcitabine resulted in enhanced inhibition of tumor growth and significantly prolonged survival. Immunohistochemistry of excised tumors revealed that both glufosfamide and gemcitabine increased levels of apoptosis (measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining) and reduced proliferation (measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining). No effects on microvessel density were observed. These results support the use of the alkylating agent glufosfamide and the DNA synthesis inhibitor gemcitabine, rather than the use of either agent alone, to provide greater benefits and demonstrate that this combination treatment should be useful in the clinical treatment of pancreatic carcinoma.
We have previously identified an androgen-responsive gene in rat prostate that shares homology with the aci-reductone dioxygenase (ARD/ARD') family of metal-binding enzymes involved in methionine salvage. We found that the gene, aci-reductone dioxygenase 1 (ADI1), was downregulated in prostate cancer cells, whereas enforced expression of rat Adi1 in these cells caused apoptosis. Here we report the characterization of human ADI1 in prostate cancer. Androgens induced ADI1 expression in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, which was not blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that ADI1 is a primary androgen-responsive gene. In human benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens, epithelial cells expressed ADI1. Immunohistochemistry of prostate tumor tissue microarrays showed that benign regions expressed more ADI1 than tumors, suggesting a suppressive role for ADI1 in prostate cancer. Bacterial lysates containing recombinant ADI1 produced a five-fold increase in aci-reductone decay over controls, demonstrating that ADI1 has ARD activity. We generated point mutations at key residues in the metal-binding site of ADI1 to disrupt ARD function, and we found that these mutations did not affect intracellular localization, apoptosis, or colony formation suppression in human prostate cancer cells. Collectively, these observations argue that ADI1 may check prostate cancer progression through apoptosis and that this activity does not require metal binding.
Sildenafil (Viagra) has been developed as a drug to help male impotence. It has a direct effect on the vasculature of the corpus cavernosum. A case of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) following the illicit use of Viagra is reported. A discussion of drug-induced ICH is included.
Cadmium (Cd) inhalation can result in emphysema. Cd exposure of rat lung fibroblasts (RFL6) enhanced levels of metal scavenging thiols, e.g., metallothionein (MT) and glutathione (GSH), and the heavy chain of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), a key enzyme for GSH biosynthesis, concomitant with downregulation of lysyl oxidase (LO), a copper-dependent enzyme for crosslinking collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Cd downregulation of LO in treated cells was closely accompanied by suppression of synthesis of collagen, a major structure component of the lung ECM. Using rats intratracheally instilled with cadmium chloride (30 microg, once a week) as an animal model, we further demonstrated that although 2-week Cd instillation induced a non-significant change in the lung LO activity and collagen synthesis, 4- and 6-week Cd instillation resulted in a steady decrease in the lung LO and collagen expression. The lung MT and total GSH levels were both upregulated upon the long-term Cd exposure. Emphysematous lesions were generated in lungs of 6-week Cd-dosed rats. Increases of cellular thiols by transfection of cells with MT-II expression vectors or treatment of cells with GSH monoethyl ester, a GSH delivery system, markedly inhibited LO mRNA levels and catalytic activities in the cell model. Thus, Cd upregulation of cellular thiols may be a critical cellular event facilitating downregulation of LO, a potential mechanism for Cd-induced emphysema.
Beta-blockers are mainstay of current treatment of heart failure (HF). Beta-adrenergic receptors (AR) single nucleotide gene polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence the sensitivity and density of beta-AR. We assessed the relation between three common beta-AR SNPs and the response to carvedilol administration.
We studied 183 consecutive patients with chronic HF due to ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, a LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < or = 0.35, not previously treated with beta-blockers. Each patient underwent gated-SPECT radionuclide ventriculography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and invasive hemodynamic monitoring at baseline and after 12 months of carvedilol administration at maintenance dosages. The beta1-AR gene Arg389Gly and the beta2-AR gene Arg16Gly SNPs were not related to the response to carvedilol administration. Homozygotes for the Glu27Glu allele showed a greater increase in the LVEF, compared to the other patients (+13.0 +/- 12.2% versus +7.1 +/- 8.1% in the Gln27Gln homozygotes, and 8.3 +/- 11.4% units in the Gln27Glu heterozygotes; p = 0.022 by ANOVA). Glu27Glu homozygotes also showed a greater decline in the pulmonary wedge pressure both at rest and at peak exercise. Gln27Glu SNP was selected amongst the determinants of the LVEF response to carvedilol at multivariable analysis, in addition to the cause of cardiomyopathy, baseline systolic blood pressure and the dose of carvedilol administered.
Beta1-AR Arg389Gly and beta2-AR Arg16Gly SNPs are not related to the response to carvedilol therapy. In contrast, the Gln27Glu SNP is a determinant of the LVEF response to this agent in patients with chronic HF.
Community exposure to asbestos from contaminated vermiculite ore from Libby, Montana, occurred in many processing sites in the United States, including a densely populated urban residential neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota.
We examined exposed community residents who never worked at the plant or never lived with a plant worker for radiographic evidence of lung changes consistent with asbestos exposure.
We obtained posteroanterior chest radiographs to identify the prevalence of pleural abnormalities consistent with pneumoconiosis, as determined by consensus of two National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified B-reader radiologists. We estimated cumulative asbestos exposure (fibers per cubic centimeters × months) with air dispersion model data and activity-based modeled exposure estimates for vermiculite processing waste contact. We modeled associations between pleural abnormalities and asbestos exposure using multiple logistic regression to adjust for year of birth, sex, and potential occupational asbestos exposure.
Radiographs were obtained for 461 participants. The prevalence of pleural abnormalities by B-reader consensus was 10.8%. A history of direct contact with the waste and ever playing in the waste piles was associated with pleural abnormalities {odds ratio [OR] 2.78 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26, 6.10] and 2.17 (95% CI: 0.99, 4.78), respectively, when adjusted for background exposure}. The regression coefficients for log-transformed measures (fibers per cubic centimeters × months) of background exposure and activity-based exposure were 0.322 (95% CI: 0.078, 0.567) and 0.063 (95% CI: -0.013, 0.139), respectively, when adjusted for each other, and 0.283 (95% CI: 0.104, 0.463) for cumulative exposure from all sources.
These results support the hypothesis that community exposure to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite originating from Libby, Montana, is associated with measurable effects based on radiographic evidence.
Clinical efficacy of the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel is hampered by its variable biotransformation into the active metabolite. The variability in the clinical response to clopidogrel treatment has been attributed to genetic factors, but the specific genes and mechanisms underlying clopidogrel bioactivation remain unclear. Using in vitro metabolomic profiling techniques, we identified paraoxonase-1 (PON1) as the crucial enzyme for clopidogrel bioactivation, with its common Q192R polymorphism determining the rate of active metabolite formation. We tested the clinical relevance of the PON1 Q192R genotype in a population of individuals with coronary artery disease who underwent stent implantation and received clopidogrel therapy. PON1 QQ192 homozygous individuals showed a considerably higher risk than RR192 homozygous individuals of stent thrombosis, lower PON1 plasma activity, lower plasma concentrations of active metabolite and lower platelet inhibition. Thus, we identified PON1 as a key factor for the bioactivation and clinical activity of clopidogrel. These findings have therapeutic implications and may be exploited to prospectively assess the clinical efficacy of clopidogrel.
This study was performed to identify risk factors of ifosfamide-induced renal damage.
Renal function was assessed in 120 patients at a minimum of 3 months after completion of chemotherapy including ifosfamide. The cumulative ifosfamide dose ranged from 2 to 95 g/m2 (median, 30 g/m2). Ten patients had undergone unilateral nephrectomy; combination cytostatic treatment included cisplatin in 51 and methotrexate in 57. Sixty-eight patients had received gentamicin treatment. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the Schwartz formula. Proximal tubular function was assessed by the percent reabsorptions of glucose and 16 amino acids, the fractional excretion of sodium, and the fractional reabsorption of phosphate. In addition, the serum bicarbonate level was measured.
Proximal tubular dysfunction--with a predominance of renal amino acid (66.3%) and phosphate loss (38.3%)--was much more frequent than both glomerular impairment and acidosis. Seven patients were identified as having renal Fanconi's syndrome, and generalized tubulopathy was noted in another 15 patients. Ifosfamide-induced nephrotoxicity was dose-dependent, with a weak linear inverse correlation between cumulative ifosfamide dose and fractional phosphate reabsorption. Unilateral nephrectomy proved to be the single most important risk factor (odds ratio for the development of renal Fanconi's syndrome, 11.4), but cisplatin also significantly enhanced ifosfamide-mediated nephrotoxicity. Methotrexate, gentamicin, and patient age at primary diagnosis had no influence on renal function.
Ifosfamide chemotherapy should probably be restricted in patients after unilateral nephrectomy.
Reduced activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain--particularly complex I--may be implicated in the etiology of both Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, although these neurodegenerative diseases differ substantially as to their distinctive pattern of neuronal cell loss and the predominance of cerebral alpha-synuclein or tau protein pathology. To determine experimentally whether chronic generalized complex I inhibition has an effect on the distribution of alpha-synuclein or tau, we infused rats systemically with the plant-derived isoflavonoid rotenone. Rotenone-treated rats with a pronounced metabolic impairment had reduced locomotor activity, dystonic limb posture and postural instability. They lost neurons in the substantia nigra and in the striatum. Spherical deposits of alpha-synuclein were observed in a few cells, but cells with abnormal cytoplasmic accumulations of tau immunoreactivity were significantly more numerous in the striatum of severely lesioned rats. Abnormally high levels of tau immunoreactivity were found in the cytoplasm of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Ultrastructurally, tau-immunoreactive material consisted of straight 15-nm filaments decorated by antibodies against phosphorylated tau. Many tau+ cell bodies also stained positive for thioflavin S, nitrotyrosine and ubiquitin. Some cells with abnormal tau immunoreactivity contained activated caspase 3. Our data suggest that chronic respiratory chain dysfunction might trigger a form of neurodegeneration in which accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein predominates over deposits of alpha-synuclein.
Three 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1-ones structurally related with piracetam (=2-oxopyrrolidine-1-acetamide) have been synthesized and tested for their nootropic effects in the passive avoidance test in mice. Compounds (RS)-2, (R,R)-3, and (R,S)-3 were obtained in good yields in only two steps starting from methyl DL-phthaloylalanine. Compound (RS)-2 exhibited nootropic activity at lower doses than piracetam, used as reference drug, but it showed lower efficacy. Whereas diastereoisomers (R,R)-3 and (R,S)-3 were as potent as piracetam to revert amnesia induced by scopolamine, (R,S)-3 showed lower efficacy than (R,R)-3. Only (R,R)-3 showed myorelaxant effect at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg; other compounds did not exhibit any anticonvulsant, sedative, myorelaxant, or impaired motor-coordination effect in mice. These synthesized 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1-one derivatives constitute a new kind of nootropic compounds.
Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is a rare cause of hereditary ataxia in north European countries with unknown prevalence. Few cases are reported from these countries.
Through a systematic population based study of hereditary ataxia in southeast Norway subjects were classified and investigated.
To report a subject with ataxia due to vitamin E deficiency in Norway.
One patient with AVED was identified. The subject was a 45 years old woman with progressive ataxia from preschool age. When she was 12 years old Friedreich's ataxia was diagnosed after neurological examination. At the age of 45 re-evaluation and re-examination was performed and genetic analysis of the Frataxin gene was negative. At that time she had truncal and extremities ataxia, titubation of the head, pes cavus, inverted plantar response, loss of proprioceptive and vibration sense and a severe sensory neuropathy. Vitamin E in serum was undetectable and genetic analysis detected a compound heterozygous mutation, p.A120T and p.R134X, in the alpha-tocopherol transport protein gene on chromosome 8q13.
Vitamin E should always be assessed in progressive ataxia of genetic or unexplained causes and especially with a Friedreich's ataxia-like phenotype since treatment is available.
AVED is rare in Norway, but exists, and we here report the first genetically confirmed subject with ataxia due to vitamin E deficiency in Norway.
The ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) catalyzes export of cellular cholesterol from macrophages and hepatocytes. Here we identify an additional function of ABCG1 in the regulation of adiposity in screens of the Drosophila melanogaster and the New Zealand obese (NZO) mouse genomes. Insertion of modified transposable elements of the P-family upstream of CG17646, the Drosophila ortholog of Abcg1, generated lines of flies with increased triglyceride stores. In NZO mice, an Abcg1 variant was identified in a suggestive adiposity quantitative trait locus and was associated with higher expression of the gene in white adipose tissue. Targeted disruption of Abcg1 in mice resulted in reduced body weight gain (8.42+/-0.6 g in Abcg1-/- vs. 13.07+/-1.1 g in Abcg1+/+ mice) and adipose tissue mass gain (3.78+/-1.3 g in Abcg1-/- vs. 9.39+/-1.6 g in Abcg1+/+ mice) detected over a period of 12 wk. The reduction of adipose tissue mass in Abcg1-/- mice was associated with markedly decreased size of the adipocytes. In contrast to their wild-type littermates, male Abcg1-/- mice exhibited no high-fat diet-induced impairment of glucose tolerance and fatty liver. Furthermore, Abcg1-/- mice possess decreased food intake and elevated total energy expenditure (Abcg1-/- mice, 748.1+/-5.4 kJ/kg metabolic body mass; Abcg1+/+ mice, 684.3+/-5.0 kJ/kg metabolic body mass; P=0.011), body temperature (Abcg1-/- mice, 37.82+/-0.29 C; Abcg1+/+ mice, 36.83+/-0.24 C; P<0.05), and locomotor activity (Abcg1-/- mice, 3655+/-189 counts/12 h during dark phase; Abcg1+/+ mice, 2445+/-235 counts/12 h during dark phase; P<0.01). Our data indicate a previously unrecognized role of ABCG1 in the regulation of energy balance and triglyceride storage.
Cantú syndrome is characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, distinctive facial features, osteochondrodysplasia and cardiac defects. By using family-based exome sequencing, we identified a de novo mutation in ABCC9. Subsequently, we discovered novel dominant missense mutations in ABCC9 in 14 of the 16 individuals with Cantú syndrome examined. The ABCC9 protein is part of an ATP-dependent potassium (K(ATP)) channel that couples the metabolic state of a cell with its electrical activity. All mutations altered amino acids in or close to the transmembrane domains of ABCC9. Using electrophysiological measurements, we show that mutations in ABCC9 reduce the ATP-mediated potassium channel inhibition, resulting in channel opening. Moreover, similarities between the phenotype of individuals with Cantú syndrome and side effects from the K(ATP) channel agonist minoxidil indicate that the mutations in ABCC9 result in channel opening. Given the availability of ABCC9 antagonists, our findings may have direct implications for the treatment of individuals with Cantú syndrome.
Inhalation of 4500 mg o-xylene by rats was found to produce adaptational and pathologic changes in the liver by the end of the 1st week, reflected in an increase in relative liver weight, shortening of the hexobarbital sleeping time, an increase in the concentration of cytochrome P-450, with a decrease in the activities of aniline hydroxylase and of aminopyrine N-demethylase. Six weeks after the start of inhalations all the changes in the liver and in the mixed function oxydase system (MFO) were of an adaptational pattern characterized by an increase in relative liver weight as well as in cytochrome P-450 and b5 concentrations, a shortening of the hexobarbital sleeping time and an increase in the activity of aniline hydroxylase and of aminopyrine N-demethylase.
The case of a 36-year old woman who developed a paranoid psychosis while abusing diethylpropion is reported. It is suggested that the newer appetite-suppressing drugs have a bigger abuse potential than eas previously thought and may therefore be a hazard for a minority of susceptible subjects. The need to test separately for diethylpropion in cases of suspected drug-induced psychosis is emphasized.
Prolonged cannabis use has a significant impact on health and well-being. Genetic factors are known to influence cannabis dependence, but few specific genetic markers have been identified. ABCB1 polymorphisms are known to modify drug pharmacokinetics but have yet to be studied for their role in generating and maintaining cannabis dependence. The objective of this study is to determine if ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism may represent an independent genetic marker for cannabis dependence risk. An open bi-centric association study was conducted in two French Addiction Centres. Caucasian patients diagnosed with isolated cannabis dependence were compared with healthy age-matched controls for socio-demographic, clinical and genetic data using chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test. Independent association between ABCB1 C3435T SNP marker and cannabis dependence was evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Versus controls (n=40), patients with cannabis dependence (n=40) had a significantly higher 3435C allele frequency (62.5% versus 43.8% respectively, P=0.017) and CC genotype (50% versus 20%, P=0.005, OR=4.00 [1.50-10.60]). Multiple logistic regression analysis of the C3435T SNP and variables identified in univariate analyses indicated that the CC genotype was independently associated with cannabis dependence (P=0.045, OR=6.61 [1.05-46.58]). This is the first time a significant specific genetic marker has been shown in cannabis dependence. ABCB1 polymorphisms may alter Delta9THC distribution, its psychoactive effects and individual vulnerability to dependence. These results pave the way to a new pharmacogenetic hypothesis in cannabis dependence.
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and causes over 250,000 deaths each year. Overtreatment of indolent disease also results in significant morbidity. Common genetic alterations in prostate cancer include losses of NKX3.1 (8p21) and PTEN (10q23), gains of AR (the androgen receptor gene) and fusion of ETS family transcription factor genes with androgen-responsive promoters. Recurrent somatic base-pair substitutions are believed to be less contributory in prostate tumorigenesis but have not been systematically analyzed in large cohorts. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 112 prostate tumor and normal tissue pairs. New recurrent mutations were identified in multiple genes, including MED12 and FOXA1. SPOP was the most frequently mutated gene, with mutations involving the SPOP substrate-binding cleft in 6-15% of tumors across multiple independent cohorts. Prostate cancers with mutant SPOP lacked ETS family gene rearrangements and showed a distinct pattern of genomic alterations. Thus, SPOP mutations may define a new molecular subtype of prostate cancer.
Recognizing the similarities between Huntington's disease (HD) pathophysiology and the neurotoxicology of various metals, we hypothesized that they may exhibit disease-toxicant interactions revealing cellular pathways underlying neurodegeneration. Here, we utilize metals and the STHdh mouse striatal cell line model of HD to perform a gene-environment interaction screen. We report that striatal cells expressing mutant Huntingtin exhibit elevated sensitivity to cadmium toxicity and resistance to manganese toxicity. This neuroprotective gene-environment interaction with manganese is highly specific, as it does not occur with iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, cadmium, lead, or nickel ions. Analysis of the Akt cell stress signaling pathway showed diminished activation with manganese exposure and elevated activation after cadmium exposure in the mutant cells. Direct examination of intracellular manganese levels found that mutant cells have a significant impairment in manganese accumulation. Furthermore, YAC128Q mice, a HD model, showed decreased total striatal manganese levels following manganese exposure relative to wild-type mice. Thus, this disease-toxicant interaction screen has revealed that expression of mutant Huntingtin results in heightened sensitivity to cadmium neurotoxicity and a selective impairment of manganese accumulation.
The treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with a previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) remains a dilemma. The authors describe a case in which clozapine caused NMS in a schizophrenic man who had previously experienced NMS during treatment with various antipsychotics. To their knowledge, this is the first report of "classical" NMS caused by clozapine alone.
Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is often used as a treatment for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and preterm labor, resulting in the exposure of a significant number of neonates to this drug despite a lack of evidence suggesting that it is safe, or effective as a tocolytic. While there is evidence that MgSO4 may be neuroprotective in perinatal brain injury, recent reviews have suggested that the effects are dependent upon dose, and that higher doses may actually increase neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a lack of evidence investigating the neurotoxic effects of neonatal magnesium (Mg) exposure on the developing brain, specifically in terms of neurodevelopmental apoptosis, a cell-killing phenomenon known to be potentiated by other drugs with mechanisms of action at Mg-binding sites (i.e. NMDA receptor antagonists such as MK-801, ketamine, and PCP).
To investigate the effects of Mg exposure on the neonatal mouse brain at different postnatal ages to determine whether MgSO4 treatment causes significant cell death in the developing mouse brain.
C57Bl/6 mice were treated with four doses of MgSO4 (250 mg/kg) on postnatal days 3 (P3), 7 (P7) or 14 (P14). Caspase-3 immunohistochemistry, cupric silver staining, and electron microscopy techniques were used to examine Mg-treated brains for neurotoxic effects.
Qualitative evaluation using cupric silver staining revealed widespread damage throughout the brain in P7 animals. Results of electron microscopy confirmed that the cell death process was apoptotic in nature. Quantitative evaluation of damage to the cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum showed that Mg treatment caused significant brain damage in animals treated on P3 and P7, but not P14.
Administration of high doses of Mg may be detrimental to the fetal brain, particularly if exposure occurs during critical periods of neurodevelopment.
By analogy with the model of pristane-induced mouse plasmacytomas, we have wondered about the putative role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the human multiple myeloma (MM) cytokine network, involving interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) as essential myeloma cell growth factors and inducing cofactors respectively. We show that PGE2 is produced in short-term cultures of bone marrow cells of patients with MM, concomitantly with both IL-6 and IL-1. Indomethacin, a potent inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase and of PGE2 synthesis, significantly inhibits IL-6 production (but not IL-1 production) by 35% to 90% depending on the different MM patients studied and concurrently to that of PGE2. Exogenous PGE2 reverses this inhibition or even stimulates IL-6 production. An IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) also significantly inhibits PGE2, IL-6 production and myeloma cell growth. The inhibition of IL-6 production is reversed by adding exogenous PGE2. These results show that induction of IL-6 by IL-1 is related to PGE2 in the bone marrow of patients with MM. Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis (as obtained with indomethacin and the IL-1RA) might be helpful to inhibit myeloma cell proliferation by reducing IL-1-induced endogenous IL-6 production not only in vitro (as demonstrated here) but also in vivo.
A total of 23 patients with advanced malignancies received escalating doses of epirubicin (100-120 mg/m2) i.v. at 3-week intervals; 15 had received previous chemotherapy. In all, 46 courses of chemotherapy were given. Mucositis (grade II or III) occurred in 47% of courses at 120 mg/m2, but in only 15% of courses at 115 mg/m2. Myelotoxicity was manifest as leucopenia, with a median white blood count nadir of 1.9 (range, 0.8-7.0) x 10(9)/l. Nausea and vomiting were generally well controlled by prophylactic antiemetic therapy. Alopecia was WHO grade 0 in 2 patients, grade I in 1, grade II in 5 and grade III in 14. No renal or hepatic toxicity was noted, and there were no episodes of congestive cardiac failure. One fatal coronary thrombosis (proven at post-mortem examination) occurred 48 h after a dose of 115 mg/m2. Four patients developed thrombophlebitis at the injection site that was not dose-related; it occurred at doses between 100 and 120 mg/m2. Two patients who had been given chemotherapy in the past had complete responses (one penile carcinoma, one gastric carcinoma). Six patients had partial responses, including two with breast cancer, one with gastric cancer and three with sarcoma. Intermediate-dose epirubicin was well tolerated up to 120 mg/m2, when mucositis became a significant clinical problem. Preliminary data suggest promising activity in gastric cancer, breast cancer and a variety of sarcomas.
Kir6.2 is an inwardly rectifying potassium channel that is expressed in pancreatic beta-cells and cardiac and skeletal muscle. Expressed together with the high-affinity sulphonylurea receptor, it reconstitutes a sulphonylurea- and also ATP-sensitive potassium channel resembling the native beta-cell channel. The objective of this study was to search for mutations in the Kir6.2 gene that might be associated with NIDDM or related to altered insulin secretion, insulin action, or glucose metabolism in healthy subjects. Using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) on genomic DNA from 69 Danish NIDDM patients and 66 matched control subjects, we report the finding of three missense polymorphisms in otherwise conserved codons and three silent polymorphisms in the gene encoding Kir6.2: codon 23 (GAG/AAG), Glu-->Lys; codon 190 (GCT/GCC), Ala-->Ala; codon 267 (CTC/CTG), Leu-->Leu; codon 270 (CTG/GTG), Leu-->Val; codon 337 (ATC/GTC), Ile-->Val; codon 381 (AAG/AAA), Lys-->Lys. The codon 23 and codon 337 amino acid polymorphisms were always coupled. The allelic frequencies of the polymorphisms were similar in NIDDM patients and control subjects. The amino acid polymorphisms were not associated with altered insulin secretion after intravenous glucose or tolbutamide injections or with altered glucose effectiveness in a phenotype study of 346 young healthy subjects. However, carriers of the maximal load of amino acid variants, the compound homozygous codon 23/337 and heterozygous codon 270, had on average a 62% higher insulin sensitivity index (P = 0.006), compared with noncarriers. We conclude that a combination of common Kir6.2 amino acid variants may contribute to the genetic background behind the large variation of the insulin sensitivity index in the general population.
This study examined the reported psychological effects of different patterns of MDMA use in men and women, and how they are modified by use of other psychoactive substances. A semi-structured interview was conducted with 466 regular MDMA users, exploring the perceived acute, sub-acute and long-term subjective effects of this drug. Factor analysis established three main categories of acute effects of MDMA: (i) positive and (ii) negative effects on mental health, and (iii) physical effects. In terms of subacute effects, 83% of participants reported experiencing low mood and 80% reported impaired concentration between ecstasy-taking sessions. Factors affecting these effects included age, gender, extent of MDMA use and concomitant use of cocaine or amphetamine. The long-term effects most frequently reported included the development of tolerance to MDMA (59%), impaired ability to concentrate (38%), depression (37%) and 'feeling more open towards people' (31%). In terms of what might persuade users to stop using MDMA, their most prominent concern was the drug's long-term effects on mental health.
