The emergence of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin has prompted a search for new and novel therapeutic agents active against S. aureus. Lysostaphin, a peptidase produced by Staphylococcus simulans, specifically cleaves the glycine-glycine bonds unique to the interpeptide cross-bridge of the S. aureus cell wall. The effectiveness of various regimens of dosing with intravenous lysostaphin was compared to that of vancomycin in the rabbit model of aortic valve endocarditis caused by a clinical methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolate. All animals were treated for a total of 3 days. The most active regimen, lysostaphin given three times daily, produced sterile vegetations in 10 of 11 treated rabbits, with a mean reduction in vegetation bacterial counts of 8.5 log10 CFU/g compared to the counts in the untreated controls. In contrast, vancomycin given twice daily sterilized no vegetations and reduced vegetation bacterial counts by only 4.8 log10 CFU/g. Lysostaphin given once daily was less effective, reducing mean vegetation bacterial counts by only 3.6 log10 CFU/g, but the combination of lysostaphin once daily and vancomycin twice daily reduced the mean vegetation bacterial density by 7.5 log10 CFU/g, a result that was significantly better than that for either regimen alone (P < 0.05). Lysostaphin was well tolerated by the rabbits, with no evidence of immunological reactions following up to 9 weeks of intravenous administration. We conclude that lysostaphin given alone or in combination with vancomycin is more effective in the treatment of experimental methicillin-resistant S. aureus aortic valve endocarditis than vancomycin alone.
Regional specific relationships between oxidative stress and the development of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive or GST-P-negative lesions in rats, induced by fenofibrate (FF), a peroxisome proliferator, were examined using a two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis model in F344 rats. Animals were initiated with a single ip injection of 200 mg/kg N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and from 2 weeks later were fed a diet containing 3000 or 0 ppm FF for 28 weeks. Animals were subjected to a two-third partial hepatectomy at week 3 and sacrificed at week 28. The development of hepatocellular proliferative lesions, which were mainly attributed to GST-P-negative lesions, was significantly increased in the FF-treated groups. Immunohistochemically, GST-P-positive lesions were devoid of intracytoplasmic nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression, whereas GST-P-negative lesions expressed higher levels of cytoplasmic Nrf2. On the other hand, nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 was observed in some cells of GST-P-positive lesions that were negative for Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and in GST-P-negative lesions of the DEN-FF group that were positive for Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. The mRNA expression levels of Gpx2 or Gsta2, Nrf2-inducible enzymes, were increased in GST-P-positive tumors or GST-P-positive lesions, respectively. These results suggest that the activation of Nrf2, due to nuclear translocation, occurs in the GST-P-positive lesions. In addition, the development of continuous oxidative stress was identified by mRNA expression analyses as well as by measurements of GST activity and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. These results suggest that the relative inhibition of nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in GST-P-negative lesions aggravated the condition of oxidative stress in the liver of rats given FF, resulting in enhanced tumor promotion in FF-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
A wide range of industrial chemicals can induce respiratory allergic reactions. Hence, there is an urgent need for methods identifying and characterizing the biological action of chemicals in the lung. Here, we present an easy, reliable alternative method to measure lung function changes ex vivo after exposure to chemical allergens and compare this to invasive in vivo measurements after sensitization with the industrial chemicals trimellitic anhydride (TMA) and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). Female BALB/c mice were sensitized epicutaneously with the respiratory allergen TMA and the contact sensitizer DNCB. The early allergic response to TMA and DNCB was registered in vivo and ex vivo on day 21 after inhalational challenge with dry standardized aerosols or after exposure of precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) to dissolved allergen. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to increasing doses of methacholine (MCh) was measured on the next day in vivo and ex vivo. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed for immunological characterization of local inflammation. TMA-sensitized mice showed AHR to MCh in vivo (ED(50): 0.06 microg MCh vs. 0.21 microg MCh in controls) and in PCLS (EC(50): 0.24 microM MCh vs. 0.4 microM MCh). TMA-treated animals showed increased numbers of eosinophils (12.8 x 10(4) vs. 0.7 x 10(4)) and elevated eotaxin-2 concentrations (994 pg/ml vs. 167 pg/ml) in BAL fluid 24 h after allergen challenge. In contrast, none of these parameters differed after sensitization with DNCB. The present study suggests that the effects of low molecular weight allergens, like TMA and DNCB, on ex vivo lung functions tested in PCLS reflect the in vivo situation.
Methaemoglobin is haemoglobin with the iron oxidised to the ferric (Fe ) state from the normal (or reduced) ferrous (Fe++) state. Methaemoglobinaemia refers to the presence of greater than the normal physiological concentration of 1 to 2% methaemoglobin in erythrocytes. Methaemoglobin is incapable of transporting oxygen. It has an intense dark blue colour; thus, clinical cyanosis becomes apparent at a concentration of about 15%. The symptoms are manifestations of hypoxaemia with increasing concentrations of methaemoglobin. Concentrations in excess of 70% are rare, but are associated with a high incidence of mortality. Methaemoglobinaemia may be congenital but is most often acquired. Congenital methaemoglobinaemia is of two types. The first is haemoglobin M disease (several variants) which is due to the presence of amino acid substitutions in either the alpha or beta chains. The second type is due to a deficiency of the NADH-dependent methaemoglobin reductase enzyme. This deficiency has an autosomal dominant transmission, and both homozygous and heterozygous forms have been reported. The heterozygous form is not normally associated with clinical cyanosis, but such individuals are more susceptible to form methaemoglobin when exposed to inducing agents. A wide variety of chemicals including several drugs, e.g. the antimalarials chloroquine and primaquine, local anaesthetics such as lignocaine, benzocaine and prilocaine, glyceryl trinitrate, sulphonamides and phenacetin, have been reported to induce methaemoglobinaemia. An intense 'chocolate brown' coloured blood and central cyanosis unresponsive to the administration of 100% oxygen suggests the diagnosis. A simple bedside test using a drop of the patient's blood on filter paper helps to confirm the clinical suspicion. Methaemoglobin can be quantitated rapidly by a spectrophotometric method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Two hundred twenty-two patients with stage II or III breast cancer following regional therapy were treated with a combination of fluorouracil, doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adrimycin), cyclophosphamide, and BCG vaccine. At 54 months of study (median follow-up, 30 months), the estimated proportions remaining disease-free two and three years after surgery were 83%and 78%, respectively, in the chemotherapy group and 64% and 55%, respectively, in 151 historical control patients. Estimated two- and three-year survival rates were 93% and 89%, respectively, in the chemotherapy group and 84% and 58%, respectively, in the control patients. Congestive heart failure has developed in three patients, possibly related to the use of doxorubicin. Adjuvant chemotherapy with these drugs was effective in prolonging the disease-free interval and survival of patients irrespective of menopausal status, degree of nodal involvement, or stage of the disease.
Prostate cancer cells metastasize to the bone where their interaction with osteoclasts and osteoblasts can lead to alterations in the structure of the bone. We determined whether the systemic administration of the bisphosphonate, zoledronate, could prevent bone lysis and halt the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells injected into the tibia of nude mice. Zoledronate did not affect the in vitro proliferation of human prostate cancer PC-3MM2 cells. The in vivo administration of zoledronate produced significant bone preservation but did not inhibit the progressive growth of PC-3MM2 cells. The systemic administration of STI571 (imatinib mesylate, Gleevec), an inhibitor of phosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, in combination with paclitaxel, produced apoptosis of tumor cells and bone- and tumor-associated endothelial cells. The systemic administration of zoledronate with STI571 and paclitaxel produced a significant preservation of bone structure, a decrease in tumor incidence and weight, and a decrease in incidence of lymph node metastasis. This therapeutic activity was correlated with inhibition of osteoclast function, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, and induction of apoptosis in tumor-associated endothelial cells and tumor cells. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease that requires multimodality therapy. The present data recommend the combination of a bisphosphonate agent with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an anticycling drug for the treatment of prostate cancer bone metastasis.
Smoking exerts complex central and peripheral nervous system, behavioral, cardiovascular, and endocrine effects in humans and is a primary risk factor for various cancers. Nicotine, a major constituent of tobacco, is the compound that is responsible for the development and maintenance of tobacco dependence. The absorbed nicotine is rapidly and extensively metabolized to inactive cotinine by CYP2A6 in human livers, which has a major impact on nicotine clearance. Progress has been made in understanding the relationship between the inter-individual variability in nicotine metabolism and genetic polymorphisms of CYP2A6. Recent findings have increased our knowledge concerning ethnic differences in the allele frequencies of the CYP2A6 variants, nicotine metabolism, and cancer risk. In this review, the potential associations between the CYP2A6 polymorphisms and smoking behavior or the risk of cancer are also discussed.
A case is reported in which chemical meningism occurred after lumbar facet joint block with methylprednisolone acetate and bupivacaine. This complication was probably due to inadvertent dural puncture. The use of steroids in facet joint injections is questioned.
We investigated the effects that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure has on the prostate in rhesus monkey offspring. Dams received 0, 30 or 300 ng/kg TCDD subcutaneously on Day 20 of gestation, and then 5% of the initial dose was injected every 30 days until Day 90 after delivery. The offspring were maintained until reaching sexual maturity, and examined histopathologically. Dose-dependent decreases in glands of the prostate and widespread fibrosis were observed in offspring. It is noteworthy that 7 years from the final lactational TCDD exposure, inflammatory cell infiltration and disruption of glands of the prostate were still observed. Differential mRNA expression associated with fibrosis, inflammatory response and disruption of cell components were demonstrated by microarray analysis, with up-regulation of TGM4, TGFB1, COL1A1 and MMP2 confirmed. In conclusion, in utero and lactational exposure to TCDD induced dose-related prostatic fibrosis, indicating prostatic dysfunction and inducible semen quality reduction in second-generation rhesus monkeys.
After twelve months of low dose carbamazepine therapy (200 mg daily) for temporal lobe epilepsy, a 66-year-old woman presented to the hospital complaining of frequent episodes of sudden dizziness. Because Holter monitoring documented intermittent complete atrioventricular block, the patient was admitted to the hospital when the serum concentration of carbamazepine was 4 microg/mL. After discontinuation of carbamazepine, the patient returned to normal sinus rhythm. The present case suggests that complete atrioventricular block may occur long after initiation of carbamazepine therapy in an older woman even if the daily dosage or the serum concentration of carbamazepine is low.
Cysteine proteases like cathepsins are widely distributed proteolytic enzymes and form tight equimolar complexes with cystatins at their active sites. Among cystatins, CST1, encoding cystatin SN, is a member of the type 2 salivary cystatin family found in a variety of fluids and secretions, including plasma, tears, and saliva. CST1 was identified as an upregulated gene in gastric cancer tissues compared to noncancerous regions using our Affymetrix GeneChip microarray.
The upregulation of CST1 in gastric cancer was analyzed using RT-PCR (n=15), immnohistochemistry, and clinicopathological (n=77) analysis. CST1-siRNA was used for the suppression of CST1 gene expression and cathepsin proteolytic activity was assayed.
CST1 was upregulated in cancerous lesions of gastric cancer tissues compared to noncancerous regions and clinicopathological analysis showed a significant correlation between high expression of CST1 and pTNM stage (p=0.044). In CST1-siRNA transfected cells, cell proliferation was reduced and the proteolytic activity of cathepsins was increased.
CST1 might be highly involved in gastric tumorigenesis and regulate the proteolytic activity of cysteine proteases.
The hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) plays a major role in cancer progression. The role of this transcription factor in prostate cancer development and its transition to a metastatic and androgen refractory state remains to be elucidated. Previous reports have identified the existence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of the HIF-1alpha gene in renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). Studies in prostate cancer, however, are variable and limited in the number of cases assessed. Herein we further investigate these SNPs, specifically C1772T (which results in an amino acid change from proline 582 to serine) and G1790A (alanine 588 to threonine). The frequency of these polymorphisms was evaluated in a population of individuals with metastatic AIPC and compared to a set of healthy control subjects. The distribution of HIF-1alpha genotypes for C1772T in 196 AIPC patients was 161 C/C (82.1%), 29 C/T (14.8%), and 6 T/T (3.1%). The genotype distribution in 196 controls was 179 C/C (91.3%), 14 C/T (7.1%), and 3 T/T (1.5%). Our results demonstrate a significant difference in genotype distribution between AIPC patients and control subjects only for the C1772T polymorphism (p = 0.024). The association of the incidence of the polymorphism with overall survival was determined to be not statistically significant (p = 0.93) by the Mantel-Haenszel (log-rank) test. These results suggest that the C1772T polymorphism in HIF-1alpha may confer susceptibility to AIPC and contribute to the progression or metastasis of this disease.
A 35-year-old homosexual man, who had already received sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and steroid therapy because of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, was referred to our hospital. He was also diagnosed as having cytomegalovirus (CMV) co-infection, and started receiving intravenous gancyclovir for CMV infection on the 2nd day of admission into our hospital. He had to continue the steroid therapy because his respiratory condition did not improve. On the 10th hospitalization day, when 40 mg of prednisolone was administered, cardiopulmonary arrest suddenly occurred, and his laboratory data showed hyponatremia and hyperpotassemia. In spite of resuscitation, he died two days later. The postmortem examination revealed that he died of adrenal failure due to CMV infection. In general, CMV is thought to cause adrenalitis, but rarely leads to manifestations of adrenal insufficiency during the clinical course. It is important to be aware that grave adrenal failure due to CMV infection can develop even under steroid therapy.
One of the major challenges when testing drug candidates targeted at a specific pathway in whole animals is the discrimination between specific effects and unwanted, off-target effects. Here we used the zebrafish to define several developmental defects caused by impairment of Egf signaling, a major pathway of interest in tumor biology. We inactivated Egf signaling by genetically blocking Egf expression or using specific inhibitors of the Egf receptor function. We show that the combined occurrence of defects in cartilage formation, disturbance of blood flow in the trunk and a decrease of myelin basic protein expression represent good indicators for impairment of Egf signaling. Finally, we present a classification of known tyrosine kinase inhibitors according to their specificity for the Egf pathway. In conclusion, we show that developmental indicators can help to discriminate between specific effects on the target pathway from off-target effects in molecularly targeted drug screening experiments in whole animal systems.
An 11-year-old boy was diagnosed as having acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, L1) in 1987 and underwent treatment with an ALL high-risk protocol (prednisolone, vincristine (VCR), daunorubicin, 1-asparaginase), which resulted in complete remission. In 1990 he developed chronic hepatitis C and received interferon therapy. In December 1994, ALL recurred, and the patient was treated with VCR. He subsequently developed severe hemolysis (Hb 12.5 g/dl-->6.8 g/dl) with increases of indirect bilirubin, AST, and LDH. Furthermore, symptoms resembling a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH) and DIC developed. Upon incubation of the patient's red blood cells with VCR in vitro, extreme deformity of the cells was observed. These findings suggested that splenomegaly, due to liver cirrhosis which had developed rapidly from chronic hepatitis C while the patient was in an immunosuppressed state induced by anticancer drugs, had trapped the deformed red blood cells and resulted in severe hemolysis. The patient died on the 165th day after admission due to liver failure.
A 45-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of hyperthyroidism complicated by atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Laboratory data revealed pancytopenia, with a white blood cell count of 2,600/microliter, red blood cell count of 330 x 10(4)/microliter, and platelet count of 6.2 x 10(4)/microliter. The patient had normal transaminase levels, but tests for hepaplastin and cholinesterase showed values of 34% and 1.4 U/ml, respectively, indicating liver dysfunction. There was also decreased excretion of indocyanine green. After initiation of treatment with 30 mg thiamazole and 20 mg propranolol daily, the patient's thyroid function normalized and the other abnormal laboratory findings such as pancytopenia and liver dysfunction also disappeared. Pancytopenia is a rare complication of hyperthyroidism. In this case, various laboratory abnormalities were normalized by antithyroid therapy alone, indicating that the hyperthyroidism itself was closely related to the pathogenesis of pancytopenia and liver dysfunction.
Functional dyspepsia (FD) is often treated with serotonin agonists; however, the efficacy of such agents has recently been questioned. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing serotonin agonists with other types of prokinetics in patients with FD.
Included studies were RCTs that compared serotonin agonists, including cisapride and mosapride, with dopamine antagonists, including metoclopramide and domperidone, and an opiate agonist, trimebutine, in patients with FD. Studies were identified by searching the Medline database (January 1951 - January 2005) and Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2004), and by manual searches. The difference in the probability of patients' responses between the serotonin agonists and control agents was used as a summary statistic for the treatment effect. Meta-regression analysis was used to detect sources of heterogeneity.
Five studies were identified. In total, 467 subjects were assigned to a serotonin agonist arm, and 322 subjects were assigned to a control arm. In the overall analysis, the summary statistic was 0.019 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.055 to 0.093; P = 0.612), indicating that the patients' responses to serotonin agonists were similar to those to control agents. However, in the stratified meta-analysis of cisapride and mosapride, mosapride had a 6.7% greater probability of producing a response compared with control agents (summary statistic: 0.067; 95% CI: 0.010-0.124; P = 0.021), whereas no significant effect was observed with cisapride.
The data suggest that mosapride may be more effective than cisapride for the treatment of FD. Although FD is a chronic condition, efficacy was assessed over short periods in the studies used for the present meta-analysis. Long-term RCTs are needed to confirm the effect.
Restoration of blood flow to an ischemic brain region is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with consequent reperfusion injury. ROS cause lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA damage, all of which are deleterious to cells. So diminishing the production of free radicals and scavenging them may be a successful therapeutic strategy for the protection of brain tissue in cerebral stroke. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of sesamin (Sn) to reduce brain injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The middle cerebral artery (MCA) of adult male Wistar rat was occluded for 2h and reperfused for 22h. Sesamin is the most abundant lignan in sesame seed oil is a potent antioxidant. Sesamin (30 mg/kg) was given orally twice, 30 min before the onset of ischemia and 12h after reperfusion. The initial investigations revealed that sesamin reduced the neurological deficits in terms of behavior and reduced the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), and protein carbonyl (PC) in the different areas of the brain when compared with the MCAO group. A significantly depleted level of glutathione and its dependent enzymes (glutathione peroxidase [GPx] and glutathione reductase [GR]) in MCAO group were protected significantly in MCAO group treated with sesamin. The present study suggests that sesamin may be able to attenuate the ischemic cell death and plays a crucial role as a neuroprotectant in regulating levels of reactive oxygen species in the rat brain. Thus, sesamin may be a potential compound in stroke therapy.
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) including HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir may be associated with the clinical complications including accelerated atherosclerosis and pulmonary artery hypertension. The objective of this study was to determine whether capsaicin, a major ingredient of hot pepper with antioxidative property, could effectively inhibit ritonavir-induced oxidative injury in porcine pulmonary arteries.
Fresh porcine pulmonary artery rings were treated with ritonavir (15 microM), capsaicin (50 microM) or both for 24 hours and, then, subjected to myograph analysis in response to vasoactive drugs including thromboxane A2 analog U-46619, bradykinin, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP).
In response to U-46619 (3x10(-8) M), ritonavir-treated porcine pulmonary artery rings reduced the contraction by 15% compared with control rings. In response to bradykinin (10(-6) M), ritonavir-treated rings showed a significant reduction of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by 32% compared with untreated control vessels (P<0.05, n=5, Student t-test). However, ritonavir treatment did not change endothelium-independent vasorelaxation in response to SNP (10(-6) M). Capsaicin-treated vessel rings did not show any significant changes in response to U-46619, bradykinin, and SNP compared with untreated control vessels. More importantly, capsaicin co-cultured with ritonavir significantly blocked ritonavir-induced inhibition of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and contraction compared with ritonavir alone treatment in porcine pulmonary artery rings (P<0.05, n=5, Student t-test).
Capsaicin effectively inhibits the detrimental effects of HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir on vasomotor functions of porcine pulmonary arteries. These findings may suggest that capsaicin could have clinical applications to prevent vascular and pulmonary complications of HAART drugs in HIV patients.
Metformin is a commonly used anti-diabetic drug with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent hypoglycemic activities. Recent studies have revealed its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. In the present study, the anti-oxidative potential of metformin and its potential mechanisms were investigated in a mouse model with carbon tetrachloride (CCl₂)-induced severe oxidative liver injury. Our results showed that treatment with metformin significantly attenuated CCl₂-induced elevation of serum aminotransferases and hepatic histological abnormalities. The alleviated liver injury was associated with decreased hepatic contents of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, metformin treatment dose-dependently enhanced the activities of catalase (CAT) and decreased CCl₄-induced elevation of hepatic H₂O₂ levels, but it had no obvious effects on the protein level of CAT. We also found that metformin increased the level of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but treatment with AMPK activator AICAR had no obvious effects on CAT activity. A molecular docking analysis indicated that metformin might interact with CAT via hydrogen bonds. These data suggested that metformin effectively alleviated CCl₄-induced oxidative liver injury in mice and these hepatoprotective effects might be associated with CAT.
The expression of core 2 beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (C2GnT) is associated with development and progression of malignancy. Sequence analysis showed that the codon 152 of C2GnT has a polymorphism having GTT encoding valine or ATT encoding isoleucine. By examining the polymorphism in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia patients, we found that the C2GnT G allele was more frequently observed in the prostate cancer group (p=0.015) than the control group. Men with the GG genotype had a 3.60-fold increased risk of prostate cancer, and men with the AG genotype had a 1.58-fold increased risk of prostate cancer compared with those with the AA genotype. The G allele was found to have a gene dosage effect for prostate cancer risk. No such risk was associated for benign prostatic hyperplasia. These results demonstrate that C2GnT A/G polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility to prostate cancer in a Japanese population.
