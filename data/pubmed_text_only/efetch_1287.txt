Normal coronary vessels and an akinetic anterolateral wall segment were found in a 24-year-old patient on angiography 10 months after a clinically established myocardial infarction. As the patient had been on a high-dosage medication with ergotamine for two years and as all risk factors for coronary sclerosis as well as evidence of other cardiac diseases were lacking, it seems appropriate to assume that myocardial ischaemia had been caused by coronary spasms.
N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)- N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid (ICI D1694) is an analogue of the thymidylate synthase inhibitor, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB3717). CB3717 was found to be active in early clinical studies, but its use was limited by nephrotoxicity. ICI D1694 is a more potent antitumour agent than CB3717 and is also more water soluble. Previous studies have shown ICI D1694 to be non-toxic to the kidney following a single administration but its renal effects after chronic administration are unknown. To assess these effects, and further define the time course and dose relationship of CB3717-induced renal damage, an assay of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been developed which can be used in mice and hence in the screening of novel compounds. The 14C-inulin clearance assay developed was used to show a linear relationship between CB3717 dosage and renal damage (r = - 0.989) following a single bolus dose (50-200 mg kg-1), in mice. CB3717-induced renal damage is persistent (greater than 6 weeks) and renal scarring was noted. ICI D1694 has been shown to be non-nephrotoxic following weekly administration of 250 mg kg-1 for 6 weeks. Measurement of GFR has been shown to be a more sensitive indicator of impaired renal function than plasma urea and creatine concentration, and the measurement of plasma creatinine concentration in particular, appears to be without value in the screening of potential nephrotoxins in certain mouse strains.
In 35 initially normotensive patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis (including 27 patients with nephrotic syndrome; NS), blood pressure (BP), urinary sodium excretion, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone level (PA), urinary aldosterone excretion (Au and blood volume were measured before and during prednisolone treatment. In 7 patients (all with NS) steroid-induced hypertension has developed. The patients prone to develop hypertension were hypervolemic nephrotics with initial depression of PRA, PA, Au, and severe sodium retention. In these patients prednisolone did not produce diuresis of natriuresis nor did it decrease proteinuria. In normo- and hypovolemic patients prednisolone produced significant diuresis and natriuresis and failed to induce hypertension. Thus, two types of response to prednisolone could be observed in patients with NS.
Sodium channel beta-subunits modulate channel gating, assembly, and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems. We generated beta2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of sodium channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo. Measurements of [(3)H]saxitoxin (STX) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane sodium channels in beta2(-/-) neurons. The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels. In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of Na(v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures, but seemed normal in other neurological tests. Our observations show that beta2-subunits play an important role in the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability.
To evaluate the cardiotoxicity, general toxicity, and activity of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, in combination with docetaxel and trastuzumab, as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer. Thirty-one patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing breast cancer, who had not previously received chemotherapy for metastatic disease, received non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)), docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and trastuzumab (2 mg/kg/week) for up to eight cycles, followed by trastuzumab alone for up to 52 weeks. Cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below 45%, or a decrease in LVEF of at least 20% from baseline. Mean LVEF was maintained at baseline level also in the subset of patients who had received anthracycline previously. Cardiotoxicity developed in three patients during the treatment cycles, and in two further patients after the end of the study. The most common adverse events were haematological toxicity, alopecia, asthenia and fever. The best overall response rate was 65.5%. Median time to progression was 13.0 months. The combination of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, docetaxel and trastuzumab combines acceptable cardiac and general toxicity and promising activity as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer.
Doxorubicin causes a chronic cardiomyopathy. Although the exact pathogenesis is unknown, recent animal data suggest that somatically acquired alterations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction play an important role in its onset. In this study, skeletal and myocardial muscles were examined from human autopsies. Compared to controls (n = 8), doxorubicin-exposed hearts (n = 6) showed low absolute enzyme activity of mtDNA-encoded nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen dehydrogenase (NADH DH, 79% residual activity, p = 0.03) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX, 59% residual activity, p < 0.001), but not of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is encoded exclusively by nuclear DNA. NADH DH/SDH and COX/SDH ratios were 37% (p < 0.001) and 27% (p < 0.001) of controls. Expression of the mtDNA-encoded subunit II of COX was reduced (82%, p = 0.04), compared to its unchanged nucleus-encoded subunit IV. MtDNA-content was diminished (56%, p = 0.02), but the 'common' mtDNA-deletion was increased (9.2-fold, p = 0.004). Doxorubicin-exposed hearts harboured numerous additional mtDNA rearrangements lacking direct repeats. They contained elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) (p = 0.006, compared to controls), which correlated inversely with the COX/SDH ratio (r = -0.45, p = 0.02) and the mtDNA-content (r = -0.75, p = 0.002), and correlated positively with the levels of the 'common' deletion (r = 0.80, p < 0.001). Doxorubicin-exposed hearts also contained the highest levels of superoxide (p < 0.001, compared to controls), which correlated negatively with the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain activities, such as the COX/SDH ratio (r = -0.57, p = 0.02) and the NADH/SDH ratio (r = -0.52, p = 0.04), as well as with the mtDNA content (r = -0.69, p = 0.003), and correlated positively with the frequency of the 'common' deletion (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) and the MDA levels (r = 0.86, p < 0.001). Doxorubicin-exposed hearts contained electron-dense deposits within mitochondria. Hearts exposed to other anthracyclines (n = 6) or skeletal muscle (all groups) had no mitochondrial dysfunction. Doxorubicin, unlike other anthracyclines, augments lipid peroxidation, induces mtDNA mutations and decreases mtDNA content in human hearts. These lesions have an impact on mitochondrial function and could be of importance in the pathogenesis of clinical cardiomyopathy.
We studied the convulsant activity of sitafloxacin, a newly developed quinolone, and its interaction with anti-inflammatory drugs in mice. Intraventricular injections of sitafloxacin and levofloxacin induced convulsions dose-dependently in the mice. The value of the effective dose for producing convulsions in 50% of the mice (ED(50)) of sitafloxacin was 50.6 nmol/head, whereas that of levofloxacin was 76.7 nmol/head. The convulsant activity of these quinolones was not affected by concurrent administration with anti-inflammatory drugs. From these results obtained in a mouse model, it is suggested that sitafloxacin has weak convulsant activity and that the convulsant activity of sitafloxacin is not enhanced when it is administered with anti-inflammatory drugs.
Twenty-one individuals, aged 28 to 29 years, with documented thalidomide embryopathy were examined in Sweden. The most noteworthy ophthalmologic finding was the high prevalence of incomitant horizontal strabismus, primarily of the Duane syndrome type. Less frequently seen were cases of both marked abduction and adduction limitation similar to a gaze paresis with no observable fissure changes, as well as a few cases of isolated abduction weakness or inferior oblique under-action. There were many examples of aberrant lacrimation, facial nerve palsy, and ear anomalies combined with horizontal incomitant forms of strabismus. Ear and facial nerve palsies are known to occur with ingestion of thalidomide early in the sensitive period (approximately days 21 to 26 after conception).
Severe lithium intoxication and irreversible neurologic damage was observed in two patients during long-term treatment with lithium salts. In one case intoxication was caused by overdosage, in the other an acute febrile disorder was pathogenetically relevant. Both patients had previously tolerated treatment with lithium without problems thus leading to underestimation of the risk of intoxication. Besides medical control of treatment by assessment of serum levels patients should be particularly informed about early symptoms of intoxication and critical situations facilitating occurrence of an intoxication.
Manganese (Mn) is a naturally occurring element and an essential nutrient for humans and animals. However, exposure to high levels of Mn may cause neurotoxic effects. The pathological mechanisms associated with Mn neurotoxicity are poorly understood, but several reports have established it is mediated, at least in part, by oxidative stress.
The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that a decrease in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity mediates Mn-induced neurotoxicity.
Groups of 6 rats received 4 or 8 intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 25mg MnCl(2)/kg/day, every 48 h. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, brain AChE activity and the levels of F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs) and F(4)-neuroprostanes (F(4)-NPs) (biomarkers of oxidative stress), as well as prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) (biomarker of neuroinflammation) were analyzed.
The results showed that after either 4 or 8 Mn doses, brain AChE activity was significantly decreased (p<0.05), to 60 ± 16% and 55 ± 13% of control levels, respectively. Both treated groups exhibited clear signs of neurobehavioral toxicity, characterized by a significant (p<0.001) decrease in ambulation and rearings in open-field. Furthermore, Mn treatment caused a significant increase (p<0.05) in brain F(2)-IsoPs and PGE(2) levels, but only after 8 doses. In rats treated with 4 Mn doses, a significant increase (p<0.05) in brain F(4)-NPs levels was found. To evaluate cellular responses to oxidative stress, we assessed brain nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD, SOD2) protein expression levels. A significant increase in Mn-SOD protein expression (p<0.05) and a trend towards increased Nrf2 protein expression was noted in rat brains after 4 Mn doses vs. the control group, but the expression of these proteins was decreased after 8 Mn doses. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of Mn on AChE activity promotes increased levels of neuronal oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory biomarkers.
Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and it appears to be one of the most common childhood cancers in equatorial areas. Unprecedented gains have been made in the cure rates for BL during the past two decades and these reflect steady improvements in treatment protocols and a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. However, the life-threatening side effects associated with conventional treatment urge us to explore new strategies. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), a natural product that has improved the prognosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) from highly fatal to highly curable, has also been proven to be effective in treating BL cell lines through multiple pathways in our study. Our data indicates that ATO can inhibit the proliferation of BL cell lines through 1) arresting the cell cycle; 2) decreasing the respiratory function and transmembrane potential of mitochondrial; and 3) downregulating the expressions of Survivin, Bcl-2, MCL-1, and VEGF. We therefore suggest that dissecting the pharmaceutical mechanism of ATO at the molecular and cellular levels may be a good strategy to explore the value of traditional natural products in treating high malignant Burkitt lymphoma.
Eighty-nine new referral hypertensive out-patients and 46 new referral non-hypertensive chronically physically ill out-patients completed a mood rating scale at regular intervals for one year. The results showed a high prevalence of depression in both groups of patients, with no preponderance in the hypertensive group. Hypertensive patients with psychiatric histories had a higher prevalence of depression than the comparison patients. This was accounted for by a significant number of depressions occurring in methyl dopa treated patients with psychiatric histories.
Few data are available about the muscle status in renal transplant recipients. Moreover, the list of myotoxic drugs is growing longer and some of them are likely to be prescribed in renal transplant patients. These conditions may act as confounding factors in case reports of both cyclosporin and colchicine myopathies. Moreover no study has evaluated the frequency of myopathy in patients on both colchicine and cyclosporin. We conducted a retrospective study including all renal transplant recipients followed in our unit in whom colchicine was prescribed since January 1994. Clinical and biological data of patients on both colchicine and cyclosporin were analysed. Secondly case subjects were compared with matched controls not receiving colchicine but cyclosporin. Ten patients received colchicine in association with cyclosporin. Five patients (50%) experienced muscular symptoms and when performed, muscular histology showed vacuolar myopathy. All five patients improved after colchicine withdrawal. Cases with and without muscular symptoms did not differ in age, transplant duration, and serum creatinine level. Mean duration of colchicine therapy was 12.2 +/- 4.4 months in cases with muscular symptoms and 6.8 +/- 4.6 months in cases without muscular symptoms (P < 0.05). No control complained of either muscular pain nor weakness (P < 0.0005). Only one patient (3.3%) had elevated serum creatine phosphokinase concentration (P < 0.0005). We conclude that myopathy is very frequent in patient on both colchicine and cyclosporin. Muscular symptoms improve in all patients after colchicine withdrawal.
Addiction is a complex process that relies on the ability of an organism to integrate positive and negative properties of drugs of abuse. Therefore, studying the reinforcing as well as aversive components of drugs of abuse in a single model system will enable us to understand the role of final common mediators, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), in the addiction process. To this end, we analyzed mice with a mutation in the alpha and Delta isoforms of the CREB gene. Previously we have shown that CREB(alphaDelta) mutant mice in a mixed genetic background show attenuated signs of physical dependence, as measured by the classic signs of withdrawal. We have generated a uniform genetically stable F1 hybrid (129SvEv/C57BL/6) mouse line harboring the CREB mutation. We have found the functional activity of CREB in these F1 hybrid mice to be dramatically reduced compared with their wild-type littermates. These mice maintain a reduced withdrawal phenotype after chronic morphine. We are now poised to examine a number of complex behavioral phenotypes related to addiction in a well defined CREB-deficient mouse model. We demonstrate that the aversive properties of morphine are still present in CREB mutant mice despite a reduction of physical withdrawal. On the other hand, these mice do not respond to the reinforcing properties of morphine in a conditioned place preference paradigm. In contrast, CREB mutant mice demonstrate an enhanced response to the reinforcing properties of cocaine compared with their wild-type controls in both conditioned place preference and sensitization behaviors. These data may provide the first paradigm for differential vulnerability to various drugs of abuse.
The safety and efficacy of incremental doses of diltiazem in treating angina pectoris were assessed in 20 patients with functional class II to III exertional angina. During an initial single-blind dose titration phase, dilitiazem produced a dose-related improvement in anginal frequency and exercise capacity. Weekly anginal attacks were reduced to 7.5 +/- 8.9, 5.6 +/- 7.8 and 4.9 +/- 7.3 on diltiazem, 120, 240 and 360 mg per day, respectively, as compared with 11.9 +/- 8.7 on placebo (all p less than 0.001). Treadmill time was significantly enhanced by high dose (360 mg per day) as compared with moderate dose (240 mg per day) diltiazem: 473 +/- 149 versus 424 +/- 146 seconds (p less than 0.05). Time to ischemic ST segment depression was similarly changed: 344 +/- 132 versus 298 +/- 142 seconds (p less than 0.05) by high dose as compared with moderate dose diltiazem. During a subsequent double-blind phase, high dose diltiazem significantly reduced weekly anginal frequency when compared with placebo: 3.1 +/- 3.0 versus 9.3 +/- 7.1 (p less than 0.001); and increased treadmill exercise time: 508 +/- 158 versus 418 +/- 172 seconds on placebo (p less than 0.05). Subjective and objective benefits of high dose diltiazem were sustained during a follow-up period of 6 months without major drug side effects.
To define the role of rare variants in advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk, we sequenced the exons of 681 genes within all reported AMD loci and related pathways in 2,493 cases and controls. We first tested each gene for increased or decreased burden of rare variants in cases compared to controls. We found that 7.8% of AMD cases compared to 2.3% of controls are carriers of rare missense CFI variants (odds ratio (OR) = 3.6; P = 2 × 10(-8)). There was a predominance of dysfunctional variants in cases compared to controls. We then tested individual variants for association with disease. We observed significant association with rare missense alleles in genes other than CFI. Genotyping in 5,115 independent samples confirmed associations with AMD of an allele in C3 encoding p.Lys155Gln (replication P = 3.5 × 10(-5), OR = 2.8; joint P = 5.2 × 10(-9), OR = 3.8) and an allele in C9 encoding p.Pro167Ser (replication P = 2.4 × 10(-5), OR = 2.2; joint P = 6.5 × 10(-7), OR = 2.2). Finally, we show that the allele of C3 encoding Gln155 results in resistance to proteolytic inactivation by CFH and CFI. These results implicate loss of C3 protein regulation and excessive alternative complement activation in AMD pathogenesis, thus informing both the direction of effect and mechanistic underpinnings of this disorder.
The excitatory amino acids glutamate and cysteine are actively transported into neurons from the extracellular space by the high affinity glutamate transporter EAAC1. The astrocyte glutamate transporters, GLT1 and GLAST, are the primary mediators of glutamate clearance. EAAC1 has a limited role in this function. However, uptake of cysteine into neurons via EAAC1 contributes to neuronal antioxidant function by providing cysteine substrate for glutathione synthesis. Mice in which the EAAC1 gene has been deleted were seen to have enhanced susceptibility to neuronal oxidative stress and developed brain atrophy and cognitive function decline with aging. The aim of the current study was to evaluate if EAAC1 confers protection against ischemic events. Young adult CD-1 wild-type or EAAC1(-/-) mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and evaluated for neuronal death and zinc translocation. The intensity of TSQ fluorescence in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons in the EAAC1(-/-) mice was significantly higher than wild-type mice, indicating that the cortical neurons of EAAC1(-/-) mice contain higher cytoplasmic concentrations of labile (or free) zinc. Zinc translocation into cortical neurons was also enhanced in EAAC1(-/-) mice. Three days after ischemia, Fluoro-Jade B staining revealed that EAAC1(-/-) mice had more than twice as many degenerating neurons as wild-type mice. N-acetylcysteine, a membrane-permeant cysteine pro-drug, normalized basal zinc levels, reduced TSQ (+) neurons and reduced ischemic neuronal death in the EAAC1(-/-) mice when delivered in a pre-treatment fashion. Taken together, this study implicates EAAC1-dependent cysteine uptake as an endogenous source of enhancing antioxidant function and zinc homeostasis in neurons in the ischemic brain.
Through whole-genome sequencing of 2,230 Icelanders, we detected a rare nonsynonymous SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.55%) in the C3 gene encoding a p.Lys155Gln substitution in complement factor 3, which, following imputation into a set of Icelandic cases with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and controls, associated with disease (odds ratio (OR) = 3.45; P = 1.1 × 10(-7)). This signal is independent of the previously reported common SNPs in C3 encoding p.Pro314Leu and p.Arg102Gly that associate with AMD. The association of p.Lys155Gln was replicated in AMD case-control samples of European ancestry with OR = 4.22 and P = 1.6 × 10(-10), resulting in OR = 3.65 and P = 8.8 × 10(-16) for all studies combined. In vitro studies have suggested that the p.Lys155Gln substitution reduces C3b binding to complement factor H, potentially creating resistance to inhibition by this factor. This resistance to inhibition in turn is predicted to result in enhanced complement activation.
Oxidative stress and the formation of aminoglycoside-iron complexes through iron-dependent Fenton reaction have been proposed to be the major mechanisms in the development of GM-induced acute renal failure (ARF); however, the efficacy of the combination of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and desferrioxamine (DFX) in the prevention and the treatment of GM-induced ARF has not previously been investigated.
In the prevention protocol, adult male Wistar rats received gentamicin (GM) [70 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p), each 12 h for 7 days], NAC (20 mg/kg, sc, each 8 h for 7 days) and/or DFX (20 mg/kg, sc, at first, fourth and seventh days). In the treatment protocol animals received GM for 7 days. Additionally, animals received NAC and or DFX starting in the fourth day after GM administration. Parameters of renal function had been evaluated 24 h, 4 and 8 days after the beginning of GM administration in the prevention protocol and in Days 5 and 8 in the treatment protocol. At the end of experiment, lipid peroxidation (TBARS assay) and protein oxidation (protein carbonyls levels) formation were evaluated in kidney tissue as oxidative damage parameters.
In the prevention protocol, GM-induced ARF was prevented by the NAC and DFX association. Lipid peroxidation was attenuated by both antioxidant treatments, but the effects of NAC plus DFX were of greater magnitude. In the treatment protocol, plasma markers of renal injury were improved only in the NAC group, despite the similar antioxidant effect of both NAC, DFX and NAC plus DFX.
Although the combination of NAC and DFX was more effective in the prevention protocol, the use of NAC alone seemed to be superior to NAC-DFX combination, in the treatment of GM-induced ARF in adult male Wistar rats.
This study is to investigate the clinical therapeutic effects and safety of treating mild or moderate depression with somatic symptoms with electroacupuncture combined with Fluoxetine.
95 cases of mild or moderate depression with somatic symptoms were randomly divided into a Fluoxetine group, and an electroacupuncture plus Fluoxetine group. Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) was used for the assessment of clinical therapeutic effects and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) was used for assessment of adverse reactions.
The total effective rate was 77.27% in the Fluoxetine group and 78.26% in the electroacupuncture plus Fluoxetine group, showing no statistically significant difference between these two groups (P > 0.05). However, the treatment took effect after two weeks in the electroacupuncture plus Fluoxetine group but after four weeks in Fluoxetine group. During this time, a better therapeutic effect on depression with mild or moderate somatic symptoms was found in the electroacupuncture plus Fluoxetine group, which also had fewer adverse reactions than the Fluoxetine group.
Electroacupuncture combined with Fluoxetine takes effect faster for relieving the somatic symptoms with fewer adverse reactions. It is worth popularizing clinically.
Norcantharidin (NCTD), a potential anti-cancer drug, is the demethylated analog of cantharidin isolated from blister beetles. The present study investigated the effect of NCTD on tumor invasion and metastasis. A cytotoxicity assay of NCTD in CT26 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability. NCTD (50 microM)-treated CT26 cells not only showed an inhibited cell invasion of 65.6%, but also decreased the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. NCTD decreased the adhesive ability of CT26 cells in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 100 microM, NCTD showed a down-expression of several cadherin-catenin adhesion molecules, including Desmoglein, N-cadherin, and alpha- and beta-catenin, while there were no obvious changes in E-cadherin and gamma-catenin. Intraperitoneal injection of NCTD (2 mg/kg/day) in BALB/c mice reduced both the pulmonary metastatic capacity of CT26 cells and prolonged the survival day of the mice. These results demonstrated that it was effective in blocking both tumor invasion and metastasis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. While cigarette smoking is a major cause of COPD, only 15% of smokers develop the disease, indicating major genetic influences. The most widely recognized candidate gene in COPD is SERPINA1, although it has been suggested that SERPINA3 may also play a role. To detect cryptic genetic variants that might contribute to disease, we identified 15 SNP haplotype tags from high-density SNP maps of the two genes and evaluated these SNPs in the largest case-control genetic study of COPD conducted so far. For SERPINA1, six newly identified haplotypes with a common backbone of five SNPs were found to increase the risk of disease by six- to 50-fold, the highest risk of COPD reported to date. In contrast, no haplotype associations for SERPINA3 were identified.
Angiographic evidence of unusual vasomotor responses occurred in two patients after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. In these patients, right coronary arterial segments that appeared angiographically normal before the administration of nitroglycerin showed narrowing after nitroglycerin. Adjacent segments in each of these vessels, as well as the other coronary arteries, dilated as expected. Both patients remained asymptomatic. Repeated administration of nitroglycerin did not alter the anglographic appearance of these vessels. No reason for the localized reduction of coronary arterial diameter was apparent. The possibility that nitroglycerin was associated with these unusual changes is an additional argument against the routine administration of nitrates before coronary arteriography.
The present study analyzed serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) distribution among HDL and lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) in atherosclerotic patients, and compared PON1 biological functions in these fractions. Serum HDL and LPDS fractions were isolated from control healthy subjects, diabetic and hypercholesterolemic patients. PON1 activities and protein in HDL/LPDS, as well as its ability to protect against lipid peroxidation and to stimulate HDL/LPDS-mediated macrophage cholesterol efflux were measured. In LPDS from controls, PON1 protein and a significant paraoxonase activity were found, whereas arylesterase and lactonase activities were substantially reduced compared to HDL, by 78% and 88%, respectively. In diabetic patients, PON1 protein and paraoxonase activity in HDL were significantly decreased by 2.8- and 1.7-fold, respectively, compared with controls' HDL. In parallel, in these patient's LPDS, PON1 protein and paraoxonase activity were markedly increased by 3.7- and 1.7-fold, respectively, compared with controls' LPDS. PON1 in HDL (but not PON1 in LPDS) significantly decreased AAPH-induced lipid peroxides formation by 33%, and increased macrophage cholesterol efflux by 31%. We conclude that PON1 is less antiatherogenic when present in LPDS than in HDL. The abnormal serum PON1 distribution in diabetic patients, could be responsible for the accelerated atherosclerosis development in these patients.
This 44-year woman was admitted for weight loss and global intellectual slowing. She had mild chronic alcoholic neuropathy. She was discontinued alcoholic consumption for 6 months and was given disulfiram (1.5 g/day) since then. She developed over a 5-day period acute neuropathy, confusion and extrapyramidal symptoms with oculo-cephalogyric and dystonic movements and myoclonus. Electromyography revealed a severe polyneuropathy. After disulfiram withdrawal, confusion and extrapyramidal symptoms disappeared within a few days, but sensitivo-motor deficit improved more slowly. Nerve biopsy was suggestive of a pure axonal neuropathy.
