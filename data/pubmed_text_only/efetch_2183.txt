Iron deficiency is usually attributed to chronic blood loss or inadequate dietary intake. Here, we show that iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron therapy can be caused by germline mutations in TMPRSS6, which encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease produced by the liver that regulates the expression of the systemic iron regulatory hormone hepcidin. These findings demonstrate that TMPRSS6 is essential for normal systemic iron homeostasis in humans.
Bile acids play a critical role in liver injury and regeneration, but their role in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury is not known. We tested the effect of bile acid modulation on APAP hepatotoxicity using C57BL/6 mice, which were fed a normal diet, a 2% cholestyramine (CSA)-containing diet for bile acid depletion, or a 0.2% cholic acid (CA)-containing diet for 1 week before treatment with 400 mg/kg APAP. CSA-mediated bile acid depletion resulted in significantly higher liver injury and delayed regeneration after APAP treatment. In contrast, 0.2% CA supplementation in the diet resulted in a moderate delay in progression of liver injury and significantly higher liver regeneration after APAP treatment. Either CSA-mediated bile acid depletion or CA supplementation did not affect hepatic CYP2E1 levels or glutathione depletion after APAP treatment. CSA-fed mice exhibited significantly higher activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases and a significant decrease in intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15 mRNA after APAP treatment. In contrast, mice fed a 0.2% CA diet had significantly lower c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase activation and 12-fold higher fibroblast growth factor 15 mRNA in the intestines. Liver regeneration after APAP treatment was significantly faster in CA diet-fed mice after APAP administration secondary to rapid cyclin D1 induction. Taken together, these data indicate that bile acids play a critical role in both initiation and recovery of APAP-induced liver injury.
We studied the effects of human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) on scopolamine-induced amnesia for a passive avoidance response and on scopolamine-induced hyperactivity, in the mouse. The pre-training intraperitoneal administration of the cytokine significantly enhanced the amnesic effect of scopolamine (1.0 mg kg-1 i.p.). Similar effects were observed after repeated administration (2,500 IU/mouse i.p. for 10 days) of the cytokine. In this condition, the treatment with the pro-cholinergic drug acetylcarnitine completely blocked the pro-amnesic effect of IL-2. The cytokine did not affect plasma glucose concentrations, nor induced any change in footshock sensitivity. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-2 significantly enhanced the scopolamine-induced hyperactivity, whereas the cytokine alone was ineffective in modifying locomotor activity. Our results suggest an involvement of the cholinergic system in the neuromodulatory action of IL-2.
The recent discovery of the estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha, ERbeta) and the progesterone receptor (PR) in human prostate tissue offers new insights into the role of estrogens and their receptors in prostate cancer development and tumor progression. The differentiation compartment of the prostatic epithelium (secretory luminal cells) expresses high levels of ERbeta, while the ERalpha is restricted to the proliferation compartment (basal cells). In high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), ERalpha gene expression extends to luminal cells and thus may mediate cancerogenic effects of estrogens on the dysplastic epithelium. Conversely, the ERbeta is downregulated in HGPIN indicating that the chemopreventive effects of phytoestrogens mediated by the ERbeta are partially lost. Irrespective of grades and stages, prostate cancer retains high levels of the ERbeta which is partially lost in androgen-insensitive stages of the disease. In contrast with breast cancer, the presence of the ERalpha and the PR is a late event in prostate cancer progression. At least 30% of metastatic and androgen-insensitive tumors express high levels of the PR indicating that these tumors harbor a functional ERalpha. The antiestrogen Raloxifene has growth-inhibitory effects on androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells in vitro and induces the apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. These data provide a rational for clinical trials to study the efficiency of antiestrogens in the medical treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
Two patients presented with atrial fibrillation which was refractory to amiodarone but successfully treated with bepridil. A 76-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and atrial fibrillation received amiodarone for NSVT, which disappeared but atrial fibrillation was sustained. A month after receiving amiodarone, interstitial pneumonia occurred. Interstitial pneumonia was improved after amiodarone was discontinued, but NSVT occurred again. He received bepridil, when NSVT and atrial fibrillation disappeared. An 83-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy, NSVT, and atrial fibrillation received amiodarone for NSVT, which disappeared but atrial fibrillation was sustained. Five months after receiving amiodarone, interstitial pneumonia occurred. Interstitial pneumonia was improved after amiodarone was discontinued, but NSVT occurred again. He received bepridil, when NSVT and atrial fibrillation disappeared.
A low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide detailed information on carotid atherosclerotic plaque size and composition. The purpose of this study was to correlate HDL levels with carotid plaque burden and composition by MRI. Thirty-four patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) receiving simvastatin plus niacin or placebo for both drugs for three years were randomly selected to undergo MRI of carotid arteries. Atherosclerotic plaque wall volumes (WVs) and plaque components including lipid rich/necrotic core (LR/NC), calcium, fibrous tissue, and loose matrix were measured. Mean WV or atherosclerotic burden was significantly associated with total HDL-C levels (r = -0.39, P = 0.02), HDL(2) (r = -0.36, P = 0.03), HDL(3) (r = -0.34, P = 0.04), and LDL/HDL ratio (r = 0.42, P = 0.02). Plaque lipid composition or LR/NC was significantly associated with HDL(3) (r = -0.68, P = 0.02). Patients with low HDL levels (<or=35 mg/dL) had increased WV (97 +/- 23 vs. 81 +/- 19 mm(3), P = 0.05) compared with patients with HDL levels > 35 mg/dL. Among CAD patients, low HDL-C levels were significantly associated with increased carotid atherosclerotic plaque burden and lipid content by MRI.
Cardiac hypertrophy is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in a number of cardiovascular diseases. Consequently, the signaling pathways that inhibit cardiac hypertrophy are currently receiving much interest. Among them, nitric oxide (NO), signaling via cGMP and cGMP-dependent protein kinase I, has been recognized as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. The present study investigated the in-vivo effect of sildenafil as a phosphodiestrase-5A (PDE-5A) inhibitor on the hypertrophic response of rat heart to isoproterenol and the relation of this effect to the level of myocardial cGMP and integrity of the constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) activity.
The results showed that daily intraperitoneal administration of sildenafil per se for 10 days was without noticeable adverse effects on survival or myocardium. Conversely, daily subcutaneous administration of isoproterenol for 10 days caused significant myocardial hypertrophy, cell injury and decline in survival. When sildenafil was injected daily, one hour before isoproterenol, survival was significantly improved and the myocardium didn't show significant hypertrophy or cell injury. Interestingly, sildenafil was accompanied by significant rise in myocardial cGMP level, a parameter which was found in the present study to possess a significant negative correlation with cardiac hypertrophy and leak of cardiac troponin T into serum. At the same time, cGMP was found to possess a positive correlation with myocardial creatine kinase activity that reflects the efficiency of the energy utilization processes in the myocardium. However, in rats given Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) as a competitive inhibitor of cNOS, sildenafil failed to show any favorable effect on survival or the myocardial injury parameters used to assess isoproterenol-induced injury.
The present study suggests that increased cardiac cGMP level by sildenafil have a cardioprotective effect probably through acting as a post-receptor negative regulator of cardiac sympathetic responsiveness. Integrity of NOS function was an essential prerequisite for sildenafil's mediated cardioprotection encountered in the present study.
Hepatobiliary diseases result in the accumulation of bile acids (BAs) in the liver, systemic blood, and other tissues leading to an unfavorable prognosis. The BA profile was characterized by the calculation of indices that describe the composition, sulfation, and amidation of total and individual BAs. Comparison of the urinary BA profiles between healthy subjects and patients with hepatobiliary diseases demonstrated significantly higher absolute concentrations of individual and total BAs in patients. The percentage sulfation of some individual BAs were different between the two groups. The percentage amidation of overall and most individual BAs was higher in patients than controls. The percentage of primary BAs (CDCA and CA) was higher in patients, whereas the percentage of secondary BAs (DCA and LCA) was lower in patients. BA indices belonging to percentage amidation and percentage composition were better associated with the severity of the liver disease as determined by the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and disease compensation status compared with the absolute concentrations of individual and total BAs. In addition, BA indices corresponding to percentage amidation and percentage composition of certain BAs demonstrated the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve suggesting their utility as diagnostic biomarkers in clinic. Furthermore, significant increase in the risk of having liver diseases was associated with changes in BA indices.
Aberrant retinal expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leading to neovascularization is a central feature of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, two leading causes of vision loss. Oxidative stress is suggested to occur in retinal tissue during age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy and is suspected in the mechanism of VEGF expression in these diseases. Arsenite, a thiol-reactive oxidative stressor, induces VEGF expression by a HIF-1alpha-independent mechanism. Previously, we demonstrated that homocysteine, an endoplasmic reticulum stressor, increases VEGF transcription by a mechanism dependent upon activating transcription factor ATF4. Because ATF4 is expressed in response to oxidative stress, we hypothesized that ATF4 was also responsible for increased VEGF transcription in response to arsenite. We now show that arsenite increased steady state levels of VEGF mRNA and activated transcription from a VEGF promoter construct. Arsenite induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation, resulting in increased ATF4 protein levels. Inactivation or loss of ATF4 greatly diminished the VEGF response to arsenite treatment. Overexpression of ATF4 was sufficient to activate the VEGF promoter, and arsenite cooperated with exogenous ATF4 to further activate the promoter. A complex containing ATF4 binds a DNA element at +1767 bp relative to the VEGF transcription start site, and DNA binding activity is increased by arsenite treatment. In addition, the ability of a thiol antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, to inhibit the effect of arsenite on VEGF expression coincided with its ability to inhibit phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and ATF4 protein expression. Thus, arsenite-induced up-regulation of VEGF gene transcription occurs by an ATF4-dependent mechanism.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, the efficacy and safety of clobazam and diazepam were compared in 114 anxious outpatients. During the 4-week double-blind phase of the study, the mean daily dose was 59 mg for clobazam and 25 mg for diazepam. Results indicate statistically significant efficacy, measured by both patient and physician rating scales, for both active drugs compared to placebo. The incidence of sedation was similar for the two active treatment groups; dizziness was more frequent in the diazepam group.
Forty-one eyes in 21 cases of ethambutol optic neuropathy were investigated for the pattern visual evoked cortical potential (VECP) and the pattern electroretinogram (ERG). In 21 of the eyes the disappearance VECP responses were not detectable. In the other 20 eyes the peak latency and amplitude of the disappearance VECP were delayed and decreased significantly compared with normal eyes. The recovery of the peak latency of the disappearance VECP in ethambutol optic neuropathy was faster than that of the amplitude. Twelve eyes in six patients were studied by pattern reversal ERG. Though the mean peak latency of the pattern ERG was within normal limits, the mean amplitude was decreased significantly. Our investigations indicated that ethambutol optic neuropathy disturbed not only the optic nerve but also the retina.
The efficacy and tolerability of the combination of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were compared with that of amlodipine in reducing ambulatory blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine levels in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor. At the end of a 2-week washout period, 92 outpatients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure > or =95 and <110 mm Hg, associated with at least 1 additional risk factor, were randomly assigned to receive either valsartan 160 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg once daily (n=46) or amlodipine 10 mg alone once daily (n=46) for 12 weeks, according to a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point, parallel-group design. At the end of the washout period and after 6 and 12 weeks of active treatment, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed, and clinical blood pressure and heart rate and plasma norepinephrine levels were assessed (by high-performance liquid chromatography). Both the valsartan/HCTZ combination and amlodipine had a demonstrable antihypertensive effect, but the combination showed an antihypertensive effect significantly greater than that of amlodipine, as demonstrated by the 24-hour (P<.001), daytime (P<.001), and nighttime ambulatory blood pressure values (P<.01) and by the clinical blood pressure values at trough, which were all significantly lower. Although the trough-to-peak ratios were similar in both groups, the smoothness indexes pertaining to both systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly higher (P<.05 and P<.001, respectively) in patients receiving valsartan/HCTZ, suggesting the combination produces a more homogeneous anti-hypertensive effect. A significant increase in plasma norepinephrine levels was associated with amlodipine (+9% at 6 weeks, +15% at 12 weeks) but not with the valsartan/HCTZ combination. The valsartan/HCTZ combination was better tolerated than amlodipine, which was associated with a higher frequency of ankle edema. These results indicate that the combination of valsartan 160 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg provides more sustained and homogeneous control of blood pressure than does amlodipine 10 mg in high-risk hypertensive patients, without producing reflex sympathetic activation.
The renin-angiotensin system was evaluated by inhibition of converting enzyme (CEI) and by testing sensitivity to angiotensin II (AII) in sodium-depleted rats made hypertensive by methylprednisolone (MP), 20 mg/kg im. During a 2-wk period blood pressure rose 38 +/- 4 mmHg (P less than 0.001) in MP and 3 +/- 4 mmHg in controls. After pentobarbital anesthesia, intra-arterial pressure and dose-response curves to AII were determined, before and after SQ14225 (d-3-mercapto-2-methylpropranoyl-l-proline) (1 mg/kg iv). CEI reduced pressure significantly in both MP and controls, although the decrease was smaller in the former (P less than 0.05). Pressor responses to AII were nearly identical in MP and controls and were enhanced to a similar extent by CEI. Ganglionic blockade with pentolinium tartrate, given after CEI, did reduce the pressure in both groups to equal levels. Responses to AII after pentolinium were similar to those obtained after CEI alone. These results indicate that the renin component of glucocorticoid hypertension during sodium deficiency is smaller than that of the normotensive controls. No evidence of glucocorticoid-induced vascular hypersensitivity to AII was detected in this model of experimental hypertension.
Neuropeptide-expressing small diameter sensory neurones are thought to be vital in generating inflammatory hyperalgesic responses. Within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), both the levels of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the numbers of CGRP-immunoreactive (CGRP-IR) DRG neurones have been shown to increase in a number of acute adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain models. The aim of this study was to look specifically at changes in numbers of CGRP-IR DRG neurones in a chronic model of inflammatory joint pain following complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection into the rat knee. In this model, there were significant increases in the number of ipsilateral CGRP-IR small DRG neurones at days 1, 16 and 35 following intra-articular CFA, compared to saline-injected sham animals. This correlated with the behavioural readouts of hypersensitivity and knee joint inflammation at the same time points. There was also a significant increase in the number of ipsilateral CGRP-IR medium DRG neurones and contralateral CGRP-IR small DRG neurones at day 1. Following dosing of CFA-injected rats with rofecoxib (Vioxx) or paracetamol, there was a significant decrease in the number of ipsilateral CGRP-IR small and medium DRG neurones in rofecoxib- but not paracetamol-treated rats. These data also correlated with behavioural readouts where hypersensitivity and knee joint inflammation were significantly reduced by rofecoxib but not paracetamol treatment. In conclusion, these data show that changes in ipsilateral CGRP expression within small DRG neurones are consistent with behavioural readouts in both time course, rofecoxib and paracetamol studies in this model of chronic inflammatory pain.
Ketamine is an intravenous drug with special properties that make it the only agent that presently serves as anesthetic, sedative, amnesiac and analgesic. Although it is sometimes forgotten, ketamine is still considered a viable drug. Water soluble, stable and non-irritant when administered intravenously, ketamine has rapid onset after intravenous injection and provides acceptable anesthesia when administered in continuous infusion. There properties make ketamine useful for total intravenous anesthesia. Both propofol and midazolam are effective in reducing ketamine's adverse side effects. Administered in children by oral, nasal, rectal and intramuscular routes, ketamine allows for gentle anesthetic induction. It can also serve as an adjuvant in regional anesthesia to supplement analgesia. In adults ketamine is most often used for major surgery, particularly in the elderly or in high risk patients who are in shock, severely dehydrated or hemodynamically unstable, or in obstetric patients with hypovolemia or hemorrhage. It is probably the anesthetic of choice for patients with hyperreactive airways. Ketamine's strong analgesic effect at subanesthetic doses allows it to be used as an analgesic during postoperative intensive care or as an analgesic-plus-sedative for patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Interest in using ketamine at low doses for cancer and non-cancer patients with chronic pain has grown recently.
To find additional susceptibility loci for lung cancer, we tested promising associations from our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lung cancer in the Chinese population in an extended validation sample size of 7,436 individuals with lung cancer (cases) and 7,483 controls. We found genome-wide significant (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) evidence for three additional lung cancer susceptibility loci at 10p14 (rs1663689, close to GATA3, P = 2.84 × 10(-10)), 5q32 (rs2895680 in PPP2R2B-STK32A-DPYSL3, P = 6.60 × 10(-9)) and 20q13.2 (rs4809957 in CYP24A1, P = 1.20 × 10(-8)). We also found consistent associations for rs247008 at 5q31.1 (IL3-CSF2-P4HA2, P = 7.68 × 10(-8)) and rs9439519 at 1p36.32 (AJAP1-NPHP4, P = 3.65 × 10(-6)). Four of these loci showed evidence for interactions with smoking dose (P = 1.72 × 10(-10), P = 5.07 × 10(-3), P = 6.77 × 10(-3) and P = 4.49 × 10(-2) for rs2895680, rs4809957, rs247008 and rs9439519, respectively). These results advance our understanding of lung cancer susceptibility and highlight potential pathways that integrate genetic variants and smoking in the development of lung cancer.
In the presented case after 3 years and 3 months treatment with DIPROPHOS (betamethasone) a transient tertraplagy developed. Also disturbances in respiratory muscle and peripheral nerve function were present.
(1) Several classes of antidepressants are available. The main difference between these classes is in their short-term pharmacological effects, leading to different patterns of adverse effects. Some antidepressants, especially tricyclics, have positive risk-benefit balances in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. (2) Duloxetine, a compound chemically related to fluoxetine, appears to have a short-term mechanism of action similar to that of venlafaxine. In the European Union, duloxetine was first approved for female urinary stress incontinence. Another brand of duloxetine has since been marketed for depression and neuropathic pain in diabetic patients. (3) Duloxetine at a dose of 60 mg once a day showed moderate efficacy in 2 placebo-controlled trials. At this dose, however, there are no other comparative trials. It is therefore not possible to know whether duloxetine is as effective as other antidepressants. (4) Two placebo-controlled trials involving patients with pain due to diabetic neuropathy concluded that a dose of 60 mg/day had efficacy, although of doubtful clinical relevance. In the absence of comparative trials, however, we do not know if this efficacy is even equivalent to that of a tricyclic antidepressant used as an analgesic. (5) In fibromyalgia, a controversial clinical diagnosis, two double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving 207 and 354 patients failed to prove that duloxetine had tangible analgesic efficacy. It is therefore appropriate that this use is not mentioned in the "Indications" section of the summary of product characteristics (SPC). (6) The assessment of duloxetine in depression and neuropathic pain confirms existing data on its gastrointestinal, neuropsychological and hepatic adverse effects. In these trials, duloxetine increased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. (7) Duloxetine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP 1A2 and CYP 2D6, creating an important risk of interactions with other drugs. (8) In practice, duloxetine currently has no place in the treatment of depression or diabetic neuropathy. Its efficacy has not yet been demonstrated to be even equivalent to that of other available drugs, and it has too many adverse effects, given this degree of uncertainty.
Ventricular tachycardia developed after the abrupt withdrawal of clonidine in a patient with atrial septal defect of the ostium secundum type, renal insufficiency, and hypertension. Ventricular tachycardia was completely suppressed by intravenous phentolamine, which contrasted with the limited effectiveness of intravenous lignocaine and procainamide. Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate or inhaled amyl nitrate reduced the blood pressure to a level similar to that after phentolamine but had no effect on the ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia was probably produced by humoral or neural stimulation, or both, of upregulated myocardial alpha adrenoceptors.
To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of heart valve disease in patients having PD treated with pergolide.
Prospective observational study.
Patients were recruited at the Hôpital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris, France. Patients Ninety-six patients having PD treated with pergolide for longer than 3 months vs 50 control subjects. Intervention Standardized echocardiography performed by an investigator blinded to treatment status. Main Outcome Measure Moderate to severe regurgitation in at least 1 heart valve.
One hundred thirty-three echocardiograms (86 in the pergolide-treated group and 47 in the control group) were analyzed in the study. Moderate to severe regurgitation was found in 15 patients treated with pergolide (17.4%) and in 2 control subjects (4.3%) (odds ratio [OR], 4.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-22.1; P = .03). Moderate to severe regurgitation was associated with the cumulative dose of pergolide (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04-1.81 per 10-mg/kg increase; P =.03). Including the present study, the meta-analysis comprised 7 trials (394 patients treated with pergolide and 280 controls). The overall OR for moderate to severe regurgitation was 3.1 (95% CI, 1.7-5.6; P < .001) in the pergolide-treated group. Risk differences were correlated with the mean cumulative dose of pergolide (r = 0.90, P < .001).
Using an end point of moderate to severe heart valve regurgitation, we performed a meta-analysis of patients having Parkinson disease (PD) treated with pergolide mesylate vs control subjects by searching PubMed (January 1, 1966, to April 1, 2007) and the Cochrane databases to identify English-language prospective observational studies that reported echocardiographic data.
Heart valve disease is independently associated with the use of pergolide treatment in patients having PD and correlates with its cumulative dose. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00202657.
To determine whether tamoxifen or anastrozole prevents gynecomastia and breast pain caused by bicalutamide (150 mg) without compromising efficacy, safety, or sexual functioning.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in patients with localized, locally advanced, or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Patients (N = 114) were randomly assigned to either bicalutamide (150 mg/d) plus placebo or in combination with tamoxifen (20 mg/d) or anastrozole (1 mg/d) for 48 weeks. Gynecomastia, breast pain, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), sexual functioning, and serum levels of hormones were assessed.
Gynecomastia developed in 73% of patients in the bicalutamide group, 10% of patients in the bicalutamide-tamoxifen group, and 51% of patients in the bicalutamide-anastrozole group (P < .001); breast pain developed in 39%, 6%, and 27% of patients, respectively (P = .006). Baseline PSA level decreased by > or = 50% in 97%, 97%, and 83% of patients in the bicalutamide, bicalutamide-tamoxifen, and bicalutamide-anastrozole groups, respectively (P = .07); and adverse events were reported in 37%, 35%, and 69% of patients, respectively (P = .004). There were no major differences among treatments in sexual functioning parameters from baseline to month 6. Elevated testosterone levels occurred in each group; however, free testosterone levels remained unchanged in the bicalutamide-tamoxifen group because of increased sex hormone-binding globulin levels.
Anastrozole did not significantly reduce the incidence of bicalutamide-induced gynecomastia and breast pain. In contrast, tamoxifen was effective, without increasing adverse events, at least in the short-term follow-up. These data support the need for a larger study to determine any effect on mortality.
Perospirone is classified as a second-generation antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. Perospirone binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and dopamine D2 receptors. There are no reports of clinical comparisons of perospirone and risperidone in multicenter studies. To clarify the clinical traits of perospirone in the treatment of schizophrenia, the clinical efficacies and side-effects of perospirone and risperidone were compared in a randomized clinical multicenter trial.
Sixty-six schizophrenia patients were enrolled in the trial. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, positive, negative and general symptoms scores and Drug-Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) scores were investigated at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.
Significant reductions in the PANSS total and subscale scores were observed in both the perospirone and risperidone groups, with no significant between-group differences at 4 and 12 weeks. Risperidone improved the total scores and overall psychopathologic symptom total scores more effectively than perospirone at week 8. There were no significant differences in the DIEPSS scores at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks between the perospirone and risperidone groups. The numbers of patients who dropped out did not differ between the perospirone and risperidone groups.
Perospirone was as effective as risperidone against positive and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Both antipsychotic agents were equally well-tolerated.
Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, is prescribed for hypertension. Its molecular structure shares features with D-penicillamine, in that both agents contain a thiol group. In addition, captopril has immunosuppressant activity. Captopril was therefore considered a potential slow-acting drug for treating rheumatoid arthritis. In an open study 15 patients with active arthritis were treated with captopril and followed for 48 weeks. Two-thirds of the patients reported improved arthritis symptoms, and significant changes were seen in several clinical and biochemical measurements, notably Ritchie articular index, clinical score, plasma viscosity, and C-reactive protein. Side-effects were generally mild and included transient taste loss, rashes, and hypotension. Only 2 patients withdrew as a result of drug intolerance.
Occupational and environmental exposure to inorganic arsenic leads to development of cancer and represents a significant health hazard in more than 70 countries. The underlying mechanism for arsenic-induced carcinogenesis remains unclear. Laboratory studies suggest that arsenic is a poor mutagen but may cause epigenetic silencing of key tumor suppressor genes such as p16 through DNA hypermethylation. However, the evidence for an association between human arsenic exposure and abnormal DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes is lacking.
Paired case-control studies were conducted involving 40 individuals with high arsenic exposure and arsenicosis, 40 individuals with similarly high exposure to arsenic but without arsenicosis, and 40 individuals with normal exposure to arsenic. DNA methylation status of p16 was determined using methylation-specific PCR. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that DNA hypermethylation of p16 gene was significantly associated with high arsenic exposure (Odds Ratio = 10.0, P = 0.0019) independently of the development of arsenicosis (Odds Ratio = 2.0, P = 0.1343).
High exposure of arsenic in human is positively linked to DNA hypermethylation of p16 gene, suggesting that epigenetic silencing of key tumor suppressor may be an important mechanism by which arsenic promotes cancer initiation.
The omnipresent 6-kDa polypeptide relaxin (RLX) is emerging as a multifunctional endocrine and paracrine factor in a broad range of target tissues including cardiovascular tissues. To explore the pathophysiological roles of RLX in ischemic cardiovascular diseases, we studied the changes in RLX mRNA level in the myocardium and the effect of RLX supplements in rats with isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury. In ISO-treated rats, RLX levels in myocardia and plasma increased 3.7- and 6.9-fold, respectively (P<0.01), the mRNA level increased significantly in myocardia compared with controls. Co-administration of RLX (0.2 and 2.0 microg/kg/d) and ISO increased left-ventricular pressure development and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVDEP) (all P<0.01). Malondialdehyde content in myocardia and lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase activities in plasma in RLX-treated rats decreased markedly compared with that in ISO-treated alone rats (P<0.01 or P<0.05). In the high-dose RLX group, fibroblastic hyperplasia was relieved in myocardia, hydroxyproline level was lower, by 33% (P<0.05), and endothelin content in plasma was lower, by 31% (P<0.01) than in the ISO-alone group. Compared with control group, any indexes in sham rats treated with high-dose RLX were unaltered (all P>0.05). These results showed an up-regulation of myocardial RLX during ISO-induced myocardial ischemia injury and the protective effect of RLX on ISO-induced cardiac inhibition and fibrosis, which suggests that RLX could be an endogenous cardioprotective factor in ischemic heart diseases.
