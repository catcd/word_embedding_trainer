The efficacy, usefulness and side effects of RO 15-1788 (RO), a specific benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist, have been evaluated. Sixty-two patients (ASA I-III, mean age 72 +/- 9 yr) scheduled for urological surgery under regional anaesthesia and BZD sedation received placebo or RO in a randomized, double-blind fashion at the end of the procedure, following sedation with midazolam. When compared with placebo, RO improved alertness and collaboration for 15 min, and suppressed anterograde amnesia for 60 min. No major side effect was noted, although five patients became anxious after administration of RO. Two cases of a paradoxical reaction to midazolam were treated successfully by RO.
The records of 21 patients admitted to hospital from January 1985 to December 1988 for acute headache associated with cocaine intoxication were reviewed. Fifteen patients were identified who experienced headaches with migrainous features in the absence of neurological or systemic complications. None of them had a history of cocaine-unrelated headaches or a family history of migraine, and all had a favourable outcome. Three possible mechanisms of cocaine-related vascular headaches are discussed which depend on the interval between cocaine ingestion and development of the headache. We postulate that acute headaches following cocaine use may relate to the sympathomimetic or vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine, while headaches following cocaine withdrawal or exacerbated during a cocaine "binge" may relate to cocaine-induced alteration of the serotoninergic system.
Properdin deficiency is an inherited X-linked disorder causing increased susceptibility to meningococcal disease. Here, underlying genetic defects in the properdin gene were identified for the first time. Samples from individuals with type I deficiency, defined as complete absence of properdin in serum, and individuals with type II deficiency, characterized by low concentrations of properdin in serum, were analyzed by direct chromosome sequencing of overlapping PCR products. The complete gene, including 10 exons and 9 introns, covering 6460 bases of the region Xp11, was investigated by direct solid-phase sequencing. In the related individuals with type I deficiency a C to T mutation in exon 5 was identified, which gives rise to a stop codon TGA and thus a truncated gene product. In addition, point mutations were found in 4 introns and a silent mutation in exon 10. In the properdin gene from related individuals with type II deficiency two point mutations were found, one in intron 3 and one in exon 4. The latter mutation yields a substitution of arginine to tryptophan, which may affect folding, secretion, and/or turnover of the protein. The genetic and biochemical implications of these mutations are discussed.
Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system lower blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats, although plasma renin is not elevated. To test the hypothesis that the actions of angiotensin II within the kidney may contribute to the high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, we infused valsartan, a subtype 1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist, via the suprarenal artery into the right kidney of conscious, freely moving, unilaterally nephrectomized (left) spontaneously hypertensive rats (12 to 14 weeks old). Valsartan (0.3 mg/kg per day for 48 hours) lowered blood pressure (change in blood pressure, -7 +/- 3, -19 +/- 4, and -26 +/- 4 mm Hg, n = 11, at 12, 24, and 48 hours) after intrarenal administration but had no significant effect on blood pressure after intravenous administration (change in blood pressure, 1 +/- 5, -3 +/- 4, and 10 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 7, at 12, 24, and 48 hours). Infusion of vehicle (0.9% saline) intrarenally had no significant effect on blood pressure (change in blood pressure, 2 +/- 5, -1 +/- 6, and 0 +/- 7 mm Hg, n = 11, at 12, 24, and 48 hours). The maximum fall in blood pressure reached after intrarenal administration of this dose of valsartan was similar to the maximum fall induced after intravenous administration of higher doses (change in blood pressure, -14 +/- 5, -27 +/- 4, and -32 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 7, at 12, 24, and 48 hours after 3 mg/kg per day i.v.). Thus, endogenous angiotensin II acting within the kidney appears to play an important role in the maintenance of high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
Neuroleptic withdrawal reactions have significant clinical and medicolegal implications for individuals with developmental disabilities. Behavioral deterioration following neuroleptic taper can represent (a) relapse of a mental illness, (b) and anticholinergic rebound reaction, (c) tardive akathisia, and (d) possibly a supersensitivity psychosis. Such reactions may preclude the discontinuation of neuroleptic drug therapy, even in the absence of a drug-responsive psychiatric illness. In this report, the case histories of two individuals who experienced a thioridazine (Mellaril) withdrawal-induced behavioral deterioration were presented. Both reactions were characterized by anxiety and insomnia, and the patients' symptoms were relieved by uncontrolled treatment with clonidine (Catapres) therapy. Evidence for adrenergic hyperactivity as a mediating event was presented.
Squirrel monkeys, prepared with chronic arterial and venous catheters, responded (pressed a key) under fixed-ratio schedules of termination of a stimulus associated with electric shock or under fixed-ratio schedules of food presentation. Although there was no necessary correlation between schedule-controlled responding and cardiovascular changes, pronounced elevations in both heart rate and blood pressure occurred during and just after brief periods of fixed-ratio responding. These episodic increases in blood pressure and heart rate were as marked under schedules of food presentation as under schedules of stimulus-shock termination. Thus, these episodic changes appear to be more dependent upon the schedule-controlled behavior than upon the type of event maintaining the behavior. Pharmacological studies indicated that under the conditions of the behavioral experiments the squirrel monkey has a relatively high degree of cardiac sympathetic tone; however, blood pressure elevations produced by administration of 1-norepinephrine were associated with an increased parasympathetic tone and decreased heart rate. The reflex bradycardia induced by 1-norepinephrine was inhibited during periods of schedule-controlled responding, suggesting that environmental and behavioral factors can not only modulate the parameters of physiological variables but also modulate this basic cardiovascular control system.
Hot weather taxes cardiovascular function and is associated with increased deaths from heart disease. Cocaine can cause hypertension, tachycardia, coronary vasospasm, arrhythmias, and increased core temperature.
To determine the association between mortality from cocaine overdose and hot weather.
New York, NY.
Retrospective review of medical examiner cases from 1990 through 1995.
All fatal unintentional cocaine overdoses from 1990 through 1992 (n = 1382) and all hyperthermia deaths of cocaine users (n = 10) were used to identify a maximum daily temperature threshold above which mortality from cocaine intoxication increased. The study population consisted of all fatal unintentional cocaine overdoses from 1993 through 1995 (n = 2008) and 4 contemporaneous comparison groups that included fatal unintentional opiate overdoses (n = 793), all other fatal unintentional overdoses (n = 85), and a subset of homicides (n = 4638) and fatalities from motor vehicle crashes (n = 815).
The number of overdose deaths and the proportion of homicides and traffic fatalities with a positive cocaine toxicology test result on days with a maximum temperature above or below the temperature threshold.
A threshold temperature of 31.1 degrees C (88 degrees F) was identified, above which the mean daily number of fatal cocaine overdoses increased steadily. On days with a maximum daily temperature of 31.1 degrees C (88 degrees F) or higher ("hot days"), the mean daily number of cocaine overdose deaths was 2.34 (SD = 1.68), which was 33% higher than the mean on days with a maximum temperature of less than 31.1 degrees C (88 degrees F) (mean = 1.76 [SD=1.37] (P<.001). In contrast, the mean number of opiate overdose deaths per day was 0.81 (SD = 0.94) on hot days and 0.71 (SD = 0.86) on other days (P=.28). For other drug overdose deaths, the mean number of deaths per day was 0.08 (SD = 0.28) on hot days and 0.08 (SD = 0.28) on other days (P=.69). Among homicides, the proportion with a positive cocaine toxicology test result was 18.9% on hot days and 19.5% on other days (P=.69), and among traffic fatalities, the proportions with positive cocaine toxicology test results were 9.5% on hot days and 10.3% on other days (P=.91).
High ambient temperature is associated with a significant increase in mortality from cocaine overdose. Based on our comparison groups, the increase is not explained by changes in cocaine use among the general population. Although cocaine use is dangerous on all days, it appears to be even more dangerous on hot days.
Four inbred strains of mice (C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, AKR/J, and DBA/2J) were injected s.c. with 150 micrograms of dibenz[a,h]anthracene and followed for 9 months. Strains C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J were most susceptible to dibenz[a,h]anthracene-induced carcinogenesis with 80% and 53% incidence of tumors, respectively. Strains AKR/J and DBA/2J were much less sensitive with only one tumor observed out of a total of 60 treated mice. Dibenz[a,h]anthracene was shown to induce hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in the two sensitive strains, C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J, but not in the two resistant strains, AKR/J and DBA/2J. When 3-methylcholanthrene-treated liver microsomes from the four strains were studied for dibenz[a,h]anthracene metabolism in vitro, the two sensitive strains not only demonstrated a 3- to 4-fold greater overall rate of metabolism than the two resistant strains, but also showed a quantitative shift with a greater percentage of the total metabolites being the 3,4-diol of dibenz[a,h]anthracene. This diol is the presumed precursor to the apparent ultimate carcinogen, dibenz[a,h]anthracene 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide.
Acute hypoxic hypoxia causes no changes in the content of SH-groups and in the activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in erythrocytes and myocardium. Adrenaline myocarditis results in activation of the glutathionic enzymes as well as in decrease in the content of SH groups in the myocardium and their increase in the erythrocytes. Administration of vitamin E partially corregates the shifts caused by adrenaline myocarditis.
4,4'-Methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is the most important of the isocyanates used as intermediates in the chemical industry. Among the main types of damage after exposure to low levels of MDI are lung sensitization and asthma. Albumin adducts of MDI might be involved in the etiology of sensitization reactions. It is, therefore, necessary to have sensitive and specific methods for monitoring the isocyanate exposure of workers. To date, urinary metabolites or protein adducts have been used as biomarkers in workers exposed to MDI. However, with these methods it is not possible to determine whether the biomarkers result from exposure to MDI or to the parent aromatic amine 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA). This work presents a procedure for the determination of isocyanate-specific albumin adducts. In a long-term experiment, designed to determine the carcinogenic and toxic effects of MDI, rats were exposed chronically for 3 months, to 0.0 (control), 0.26, 0.70, and 2.06 mg MDI/m(3) as aerosols. Albumin was isolated from plasma, digested with Pronase E, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. MDI formed adducts with lysine: N(6)-[({4-[4-aminobenzyl]phenyl}amino)carbonyl]lysine (MDI-Lys) and N(6)-[({4-[4-(acetylamino)benzyl]phenyl}amino)carbonyl] lysine (AcMDI-Lys). For the quantitation of the adducts in vivo, isotope dilution mass spectrometry was used to measure the adducts in 2 mg of albumin. The adducts found in vivo (MDI-Lys and AcMDI-Lys) and the corresponding isotope labeled compounds (MDI-[(13)C(6)(15)N(2)]Lys and Ac[(2)H(4)]MDI-Lys) were synthesized and used for quantitation. The MDI-Lys levels increased from 0-24.8 pmol/mg albumin, and the AcMDI-Lys levels increased from 0-1.85 pmol/mg albumin. The mean ratio of MDI-Lys/AcMDI-Lys for each dose level was greater than >20. The albumin adducts correlate with other biomarkers measured in the same rats in the past: urinary metabolites and hemoglobin adducts released after mild base hydrolysis. This method will enable one to measure isocyanate-specific albumin adducts in workers. This new biomonitoring procedure will allow for the assessment of suspected exposure sources and may contribute to the identification of individuals who are particularly vulnerable for developing bronchial asthma and other respiratory diseases after exposure to isocyanates. In addition, it will help to improve the production of antigens for the analysis of antibodies in exposed workers.
Myocardial performance of streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-hypertensive rats was examined using the isolated working heart apparatus at various time periods after induction of the experimental diseases. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and plasma levels of glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as ventricular weight-to-body weight ratio, were also determined. In nondiabetic rats it was found that DOCA hypertension was associated with an increase in plasma cholesterol, a decrease in circulating insulin level, lower weight gain, and ventricular enlargement compared with control rats. Diabetic rats developed myocardial dysfunction in a time-dependent manner and exhibited hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, bradycardia, and ventricular enlargement. Compared with the normotensive diabetic animals, STZ-diabetic DOCA-hypertensive rats showed a similar magnitude of myocardial dysfunction and a greater degree of ventricular enlargement, but significantly less severe hyperglycemia. It is concluded that DOCA-induced hypertension does not aggravate the severity of myocardial dysfunction developed in STZ-diabetic rats. It is also suggested that DOCA may have an action on glucose metabolism either directly or via an effect on insulin secretion.
Clonidine may be useful in controlling tobacco withdrawal and in facilitating smoking cessation. This study was developed to test the efficacy of transdermal clonidine in promoting smoking cessation.
We conducted a five-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial of transdermal clonidine in conjunction with a minimal behavioral intervention for smoking cessation. The intervention was based on the American Lung Association's Freedom From Smoking program. Self report of not smoking was validated with exhaled air carbon monoxide of less than 8 ppm and salivary cotinine of less than 20 ng/mL. Transdermal clonidine therapy began 1 week before the target quit date: 0.1 mg/24 h for the first 4 days increasing to 0.2 mg/24 h for the next 3 days, if the lower dose was tolerated. The highest tolerated dose was then continued for 6 weeks after target quit day. Withdrawal symptoms were measured daily for the first 7 days after target quit day.
A total of 213 patients were enrolled (106 active drug and 107 placebo). During the study, 15.5% of patients had drug therapy discontinued due to adverse effects, 24.5% (26/106) taking active drug vs 8.4% (9/107) receiving placebo. There was a significant reduction in anxiety score from 3.0 to 2.4 (placebo vs active) and irritability score from 2.2 to 1.7 (placebo vs active) during the first week after cessation. There was no reduction in other withdrawal symptoms. The overall 12-week abstinence rate was 33.0% (35/106) in the active drug group vs 34.5% (37/107) in the placebo group (not significant).
This study demonstrated some reduction in early withdrawal symptoms with the use of a clonidine transdermal patch, but no increase in cessation rate, 6 weeks after medication had been discontinued.
The potential exposure of workers to both 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (2,4-TDI) and 2,6-TDI led to an investigation of the comparative respiratory sensitization potential of these two isomers. Separate groups of guinea pigs were either sham exposed or exposed to one of the isomers 3 h/day for 5 consecutive days (sensitization phase). The mean concentration during the sensitization phase ranged from 1. 29 to 1.40 ppm. The animals were then conventionally housed for 2 wk and challenged for 1 h on 3 subsequent weeks with either the same isomer or the alternate isomer. The first 2 wk of the challenge phase involved exposure to TDI vapor (18 to 46 ppb), whereas the third challenge was to an aerosol of TDI-guinea pig serum albumin (GPSA) conjugate (18 to 32 mg/m(3)). The endpoint used to detect both immediate-onset and delayed-onset hypersensitivity responses was respiratory rate. Body weights and clinical signs were also recorded. There were clear decrements in weight gain in response to the wk 1 exposure to either isomer of TDI, but no isomer-specific differences were observed. Clinical signs revealed irritation to the respiratory tract only during the sensitization phase. A single animal challenged with TDI-GPSA may have experienced a severe anaphylactic response during the challenge phase. The incidence of immediate-onset hypersensitivity responses resulting from challenge with TDI vapor was less robust and less consistent than that resulting from challenge with the TDI-GPSA conjugate. All groups sensitized with either isomer showed an increased incidence of responders. There was no apparent difference between the two isomers. The delayed-onset phase produced more spontaneous variability in spontaneous respiratory rates and was not amenable to analysis for response to TDI challenge. Thus, no isomer-dependent differences were observed.
Cardiac hypertrophy is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The hypertrophic process is mediated, in part, by oxidative stress-mediated signaling pathways. We hypothesized that isorhapontigenin (ISO), a new resveratrol analog, inhibits cardiac hypertrophy by blocking oxidative stress and oxidative stress-mediated signaling pathways. We treated cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II (Ang II) with or without ISO and found that ISO inhibited Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. These effects were associated with a decrease in the levels of reactive oxygen species and H2O2 and the content of intracellular malonaldehyde and an increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Ang II induced the phosphorylation of PKC, Erk1/2, JNK, and p38 in cardiomyocytes and such phosphorylation was inhibited by ISO. ISO also blocked the PKC-dependent PI3K-Akt-GSK3beta/p70S6K pathway. These effects lead to direct or indirect inhibition of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation. Our results revealed that pretreatment with ISO significantly inhibited Ang II-mediated NF-kappaB through affecting the degradation and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and the activity of IKKbeta and AP-1 activation by influencing the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. In addition, we also established the molecular link between activation of PKC and MAPKs and activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in cardiomyocytes. We also found that ISO treatment significantly attenuated heart weight/body weight ratio by approximately 25%, decreased posterior wall thickness and left ventricle diastolic and systolic diameters, and increased 10% fractional shortening in an aortic-banded rat model. Furthermore, treatment with ISO significantly decreased cardiac myocyte size and systolic blood pressure. These findings suggest that ISO prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy through an antioxidant mechanism involving inhibition of different intracellular signaling transduction pathways.
Eighteen chronic schizophrenic patients received subcutaneous doses of apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist, and of placebo in separate trials. A significant improvement in psychotic symptoms occurred after apomorphine compared to placebo. The results are interpreted as a consequence of presynaptic dopamine receptor activation by apomorphine with a subsequent decrease in dopamine-mediated neural transmission.
In order to estimate the role of the sympatho-adrenal system as a trigger in cardiovascular mortality risk after L-DOPA administration in patients with Parkinsons disease we performed the following experiments in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto-rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). L-DOPA was given orally in increasing doses (30, 100, 300 mg/kg b.w.). Haemodynamic parameters (BP, HR) were measured by tail cuff plethysmography and catecholamine concentrations in tissues assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Stressful situations were induced by experimental myocardial infarction. After administration of L-DOPA a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure in both WKY and SHR was observed with a prolongation in SHR. Significantly increased concentrations of dopamine in the hearts were measured in both strains. Noradrenaline stores in the heart of WKY were more filled than in the heart of SHR. Only in SHR high adrenaline concentration in the adrenal medulla were measured after L-DOPA administration. Circulating adrenaline concentrations were significantly enhanced after myocardial infarction in WKY and could be further elevated by pretreatment with L-DOPA. From the results obtained it is concluded that L-DOPA administration in WKY and SHR leads to exaggerate synthesis and massive release of catecholamines and in consequence to an enhanced cardiovascular mortality risk due to cardiotoxicity of catecholamines. It can be extrapolated that increased cardiovascular mortality risk seen in Parkinson patients treated with L-DOPA and benzerazide is probably associated with increased synthesis and release of catecholamines during stressful situations.
Awake regional anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in former preterm infants is suggested to avoid life-threatening respiratory complications known to occur after general anaesthesia. Caudal anaesthesia is becoming a more popular technique for this purpose. To prolong duration of anaesthesia and to reduce postoperative need for analgesics in these infants, caudal clonidine has been considered useful. We report a former preterm infant, who had two awake caudal anaesthetics for herniotomy within 3 weeks. The first was uneventful with bupivacaine 0.25% at 35 weeks postconceptional age. At 38 weeks, the baby suffered form intra- and postoperative apnoeas after inadvertent administration of bupivacaine 0.125% plus clonidine.
Clinical data on 3,911 patients were collected from 64 individual investigators to evaluate the safety of intravenous dipyridamole-thallium imaging as an alternative to exercise thallium imaging for the evaluation of coronary artery disease. There were two deaths because of myocardial infarctions, two nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and six cases of acute bronchospasm. Chest pain occurred in 770 patients (19.7%). Headache and dizziness were reported by 476 patients (12.2%) and 460 patients (11.8%), respectively. ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram were seen in 292 patients (7.5%). Use of parenteral aminophylline to treat adverse events associated with intravenous dipyridamole brought complete relief of symptoms in 439 of 454 patients (96.7%). There is a potential for increased risk for serious ischemic events in patients with a history of unstable angina who are administered intravenous dipyridamole. In patients with acutely unstable angina (i.e., continuing chest pain) or in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, use of intravenous dipyridamole in thallium scintigraphy should be avoided. There is also an increased risk for bronchospasm in patients with a history of asthma; acute bronchospasm can be relieved immediately by administration of aminophylline. These results demonstrate that intravenous dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy is a relatively safe, noninvasive technique for the evaluation of coronary artery disease.
A genetic variation located in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene (prothrombin 20210 G-->A) was recently described as a risk factor for venous thrombosis. We examined how the presence of this mutation affected the risk of myocardial infarction in a population-based case-control study. Furthermore, we studied the risk of myocardial infarction associated with the simultaneous presence of a coagulation defect (ie, the 20210 AG genotype of prothrombin or the factor V Leiden mutation) and Major cardiovascular risk factors.
Among 560 men with a first myocardial infarction before the age of 70 years, 1.8% were heterozygous carriers of the 20210 variant of the prothrombin gene. The control group consisted of 646 men who were frequency matched by age. In the latter group, the frequency of the 20210 AG genotype was 1.2%. The risk of myocardial infarction in the presence of the AG genotype was increased by 50% (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.6 to 3.8). The risk of myocardial infarction for carriership of factor V Leiden mutation was increased by 40% (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.2). When a coagulation defect was present (ie, the 20210 AG prothrombin genotype or the factor V Leiden mutation), the risk of myocardial infarction for carriers versus noncarriers was 1.4 (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.2). This risk was substantially increased when one of the major cardiovascular risk factors of smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or obesity also was present, with odds ratios varying between 3 and 6. These risks exceeded those of the single effects of the cardiovascular risk factors (ie, in the absence of the coagulation defect).
We conclude that in men the 20210 G-->A variant of prothrombin is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. The combined presence of major cardiovascular risk factors and carriership of a coagulation defect increases the risk considerably.
Atrial flutter developed in an 80-year-old woman after 10 days of treatment with maprotiline at therapeutic concentrations. This cardiac irregularity is extremely rare with the conventional antidepressants. Evidence is reviewed to suggest that the likely mechanism was reuptake blockade of noradrenergic amines stimulating reentrant excitation within the atria.
Changes in bile acid (BA) metabolism and gallbladder function are critical factors in the pathogenesis of gallstones. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) - often overweight and insulin resistant - are at risk for gallstone disease. The question arises whether HTG itself contributes to gallstone formation or whether gallstone disease only associates with this disorder. Triglycerides are formed in response to fluxes of non-esterified fatty acids and glucose. Hypertriglyceridemia results from either overproduction of triglycerides by the liver, impaired lipolysis or a combination of both. Hyperinsulinemia, as observed in the insulin resistant state, stimulates very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride synthesis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver X receptors (LXRs), farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) are the nuclear receptors involved in the regulation of lipogenesis. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is involved in the production of VLDL and its activation is also under control of transcription factors as FXR and Forkhead box-O1 (FoxO1). Triglyceride and BA metabolism are linked. There is an inverse relationship between bile acid fluxes and pool size and VLDL production and SHP (small heterodimer partner) and FXR are the link between BAs and TG metabolism. BAs are also ligands for FXR and G-protein-coupled receptors, such as TGR5. FXR activation by BAs suppresses the expression of MTP, transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c and other lipogenic genes. LXRs stimulate lipogenesis whereas FXRs inhibit the metabolic process. Synthesis of BAs from cholesterol occurs either via the classical pathway (7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol; CYP7A1) or via the alternate pathway (CYP39A1 or CYP7B1). BAs induce FXR, which inhibits CYP7A1 transcription by activation of SHP and inhibition of HNF4α transactivation. Bile composition (supersaturation with cholesterol), gallbladder dysmotility, inflammation, hypersecretion of mucin gel in the gallbladder and slow large intestinal motility and increased intestinal cholesterol absorption may contribute to the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. In HTG patients supersaturated bile may be related to the presence of obesity rather than to HTG itself. Contraction and relaxation of the gallbladder are regulated by neuronal, hormonal and paracrine factors. Postprandial gallbladder emptying is regulated by cholecystokinin (CCK). Poor postprandial gallbladder contraction may be due to the magnitude of the CCK response and to the amount of CCK receptors in the gallbladder smooth muscle cells. In the fasting state gallbladder motility is associated with the intestinal migrating motor complex (MMC) activity and with elevated plasma motilin levels. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF19), produced on arrival of bile acids in the ileum, is also important for gallbladder motility. Gallbladder motility is impaired in HTG patients compared to BMI matched controls. There is evidence that the gallbladder in HTG is less sensitive to CCK and that this sensitivity improves after reversal of high serum TG levels by use of TG lowering agents. In hypertriglyceridemia TG lowering therapy (fibrates or fish-oil) is essential to prevent cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis. Fibrates, however, also increase the risk for cholelithiasis by increasing biliary cholesterol saturation and by reduction of bile acid synthesis. On the other hand fish-oil decreases biliary cholesterol saturation. Fish-oil may increase bile acid synthesis by activation of 7alpha-hydroxylase and may inhibit VLDL production and secretion through activation of nuclear factors and increased apoB degradation. In HTG patients, gallbladder motility improves during bezafibrate as well as during fish-oil therapy. The question remains whether improvement of gallbladder motility and increased lithogenicity of bile by bezafibrate therapy counteract each other or still result in gallstone formation in HTG patients.
Acrolein is a highly reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, but the factors that control its reactions with nucleophilic groups on proteins remain poorly understood. Lipid peroxidation and threonine oxidation by myeloperoxidase are potential sources of acrolein during inflammation. Because both pathways are implicated in atherogenesis and high density lipoprotein (HDL) is anti-atherogenic, we investigated the possibility that acrolein might target the major protein of HDL, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), for modification. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that lysine 226, located near the center of helix 10 in apoA-I, was the major site modified by acrolein. Importantly, this region plays a critical role in the cellular interactions and ability of apoA-I to transport lipid. Indeed, we found that conversion of Lys-226 to N(epsilon)-(3-methylpyridinium)lysine by acrolein associated quantitatively with decreased cholesterol efflux from cells via the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 pathway. In the crystal structure of truncated apoA-I, Glu-234 lies adjacent to Lys-226, suggesting that negatively charged residues might direct the modification of specific lysine residues in proteins. Finally, immunohistochemical studies with a monoclonal antibody revealed co-localization of apoA-I with acrolein adducts in human atherosclerotic lesions. Our observations suggest that acrolein might interfere with normal reverse cholesterol transport by HDL by modifying specific sites in apoA-I. Thus, acrolein might contribute to atherogenesis by impairing cholesterol removal from the artery wall.
Maternal cocaine abuse in pregnancy is associated with complications such as intrauterine growth retardation, abruptio placentae, and preterm delivery.
We report what is, to our knowledge, the first published observation of fetal bilateral renal agenesis associated with a vascular disruption syndrome comprising upper limb reduction defect and a single umbilical artery following maternal cocaine abuse in early pregnancy.
This constellation in a fetus aborted at 18 weeks extends the spectrum of complications possibly associated with cocaine abuse in pregnancy.
Obesity is known to be a risk factor for colon carcinogenesis. Although there are several reports on the chemopreventive abilities of dietary flavonoids in chemically induced colon carcinogenesis, those have not been addressed in an obesity-associated carcinogenesis model. In the present study, the effects of 3 flavonoids (chrysin, quercetin and nobiletin) on modulation of the occurrence of putative preneoplastic lesions, aberrant crypt foci (ACF), and beta-catenin-accumulated crypts (BCACs) in the development of colon cancer were determined in male db/db mice with obesity and diabetic phenotypes. Male db/db mice were given 3 weekly intraperitoneal injections of azoxymethane (AOM) to induce the ACF and BCAC. Each flavonoid (100ppm), given in the diet throughout the experimental period, significantly reduced the numbers of ACF by 68-91% and BCAC by 64-71%, as well as proliferation activity in the lesions. Clinical chemistry results revealed that the serum levels of leptin and insulin in mice treated with AOM were greater than those in the untreated group. Interestingly, the most pronounced suppression of development of preneoplastic lesions and their proliferation were observed in the quercetin-fed group, in which the serum leptin level was lowered. Furthermore, quercetin-feeding decreased leptin mRNA expression and secretion in differentiated 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes. These results suggest that the present dietary flavonoids are able to suppress the early phase of colon carcinogenesis in obese mice, partly through inhibition of proliferation activity caused by serum growth factors. Furthermore, they indicate that certain flavonoids may be useful for prevention of colon carcinogenesis in obese humans.
