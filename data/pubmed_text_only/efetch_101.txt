Lorazepam, 4 mg, was evaluated in an 18-night sleep-laboratory study involving five insomniac subjects. Hypnotic effectiveness and effects on sleep stages and related parameters were assessed. Placebo was given on baseline nights 1 to 4, lorazepam on nights 5 to 11, and placebo was given again on withdrawal nights 12 to 18. Subjective and objective data clearly demonstrated that lorazepam was effective for both inducing and maintaining sleep. Sleep latency was reduced from a baseline value of 34.6 min to 17.9 min (P less than 0.01) and total wake time was reduced from 75.9 to 38.5 min (P less than 0.01). On the third and fifth nights of drug withdrawal total wake time rose above baseline levels (termed rebound insomnia) and sleep latency increased by 77% and 60% over baseline (P less than 0.01). Subjective estimates of daytime anxiety also increased above baseline (rebound anxiety) during the withdrawal period. All subjects experienced severe hangover and varying degrees of impaired functioning during the first 3 days on drug. Three subjects also experienced anterograde amnesia during the day after the first drug night. These side effects diminished in intensity over the course of the study. Our results suggest that while 4 mg lorazepam may be effective in inducing and maintaining sleep, this dose induces clinically significant side effects that are followed by consistent rebound phenomena after withdrawal.
We compared the effect of deliberate hypotension with PGE1 on PaO2 between pediatric and adult patients. Seven children, aged 3-9 yrs and 10 adults, aged 35-65 yrs who were scheduled for elective head and neck surgeries were studied. Anesthesia was maintained with enflurane, 50% N2O in oxygen and supplemental infusion of fentanyl. Ventilation was controlled to maintain PaCO2 at 35-40 mmHg. Hypotension was induced with continuous infusion of PGE1 and the systolic blood pressure was maintained at 70% of the presurgical value. Blood gases were measured three times, i.e. before, during, and after hypotension. The hypotension in adults caused a significant reduction in PaO2. In children, on the contrary, PaO2 was not affected by the hypotension. The results suggest that intrapulmonary shunting is smaller in children than in adults during PGE1-induced hypotension.
The induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is particularly important for the invasiveness of various cancer cells. Osthole, a natural coumarin derivative extracted from traditional Chinese medicines, is known to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells, but the effect of osthole on the invasiveness of tumor cells is largely unknown. This study determines whether and by what mechanism osthole inhibits invasion in CL1-5 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Herein, we found that osthole effectively inhibited the migratory and invasive abilities of CL1-5 cells. A zymographic assay showed that osthole inhibited the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 in CL1-5 cells. Inhibition of migration, invasion, and MMP2 and/or MMP-9 proteolytic activities was also observed in other lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H1299 and A549). We further found that osthole inhibited MMP-9 expression at the messenger RNA and protein levels. Moreover, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that osthole inhibited the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 by suppressing the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-κB in the MMP-9 promoter. Using reporter assays with point-mutated promoter constructs further confirmed that the inhibitory effect of osthole requires an NF-κB binding site on the MMP-9 promoter. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that osthole inhibited NF-κB activity by inhibiting IκB-α degradation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that osthole inhibits NF-κB-mediated MMP-9 expression, resulting in suppression of lung cancer cell invasion and migration, and osthole might be a potential agent for preventing the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer.
An uncontrollable bleeding of the urinary bladder was successfully treated using a 4% formalin strip tamponade with vesico-ureteral reflux and supportive therapy with thrombocyte concentrates and transfusions of fresh blood. Non-toxic side-effects of oxazaphosphorin derivates and modern methods of prophylaxis using a uroprotectic are presented. Previously the use of formalin together with vesicoureteral reflux was contraindicated; in this case it was successfully applied for the first time via the suprapubic route using a strip tamponade.
A randomized, open, controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of sodium stibogluconate plus allopurinol and sodium stibogluconate alone as treatment of patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. In phase 1 of the study, all 22 patients with severe disease had improvement of their lesions, but only two had clinical cure (both of these patients received sodium stibogluconate alone). In phase 2, which included 59 patients with moderate disease, the cure rate among sodium stibogluconate recipients was 75% (21 of 28) compared with 63.6% (14 of 22) among the sodium stibogluconate plus allopurinol recipients. The rates of clinical adverse events were similar among both groups. Thrombocytopenia was more frequent in the sodium stibogluconate plus allopurinol recipients, but the difference was not statistically significant. Eight patients (two sodium stibogluconate recipients and six sodium stibogluconate plus allopurinol recipients) withdrew from the study because of severe thrombocytopenia. In this study, the addition of allopurinol to sodium stibogluconate provided no clinical benefit as treatment of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.
The appearance of psychiatric symptoms is not rare in the course and treatment of Parkinson's disease. In particular, therapy with L-dopa or dopamine agonists leads to increased dream activity. As with sleep disturbances, this can be a warning signal of paranoid hallucinatory psychosis.However, isolated visual hallucinations before manifest psychosis in Parkinson's must generally be regarded as resulting from medication. They occur in up to 30% of Parkinson's patients and often involve visual and figurative hallucinations. Visual hallucinations most probably result from the combined effect on dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the CNS. Therapy consists in normalization of H(2)O and electrolyte levels, control of the accompanying medication, reduction of the evening doses of anti-Parkinson's medications, and serotonin antagonists such as clozapine.
The effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving tacrolimus was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996. Two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine, and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving nifedipine. The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients. Nifedipine significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum creatinine levels at 6 and 12 months. The observed positive impact of nifedipine on reducing the nephrotoxicity associated with tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat hypertension in this population.
Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia. The typical fluoxetine-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine-induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder. Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, dose reduction, or both. The authors suggest that fluoxetine-induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine-induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant-induced "jitteriness" may be identical.
Thirteen juvenile-onset diabetics with azotemic diabetic nephropathy (mean serum creatinine level, 6.8 mg/dl) being evaluated fro renal transplantation underwent cardiac catheterization with angiography. All were followed for development of acute renal failure. Twelve (92%) developed some evidence of acute renal failure. Two required potassium exchange resin therapy. Six required dialysis acutely. There were no deaths. All patients who received greater than 65 ml/m2 of iodinated contrast developed acute renal failure. No patient with a hemoglobin value greater than 9.9 g/dl required dialysis or potassium exchange resin. The single patients without acute renal failure received less than 50 ml/m2 of iodinated contrast and had the highest hemoglobin value (12.0 g/dl). No cardiac or angiographic variables were predictive of acute renal failure. In this group at high risk for acute renal failure, radiographic contrast procedures should only be done if the information to be obtained is weighed against the potential for injury.
A 25-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 0) who had no history indicating the toxemia of pregnancy developed hypertension and severe throbbing headache after the delivery of her first child by the cesarean section. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure ensued 5 days after the delivery, after which she did not fully regain her consciousness. Her head T2-weighted and FLAIR MRIs showed areas of multiple high intensities in the basal ganglia and cerebral white matter. Her cerebral MRA revealed the segmental stenosis and irregular wall of the major vessels, in particular of the right MCA trunk. Three weeks later, these abnormalities in the neuroimages disappeared and she was free of any symptoms. The history disclosed that obstetricians had used methylergometrine maleate for uterine contraction after delivery and then sumatriptan for her throbbing headache. We speculate that these vasoconstrictive agents might have induced the postpartum cerebral angiopathy. Postpartum cerebral angiopathy may be distinct from reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy in that the abnormalities are not restricted to the posterior lobes and that the vascular changes are apparent on neuroimagings. However, this entity might have a common underlying physiology, which is the abnormally elevated blood pressure that occurs in the setting of early postpartum period. Caution should be exercised when vasoconstrictives are to be used in postpartum period.
Three models of cardiac hypertrophy (aortic constriction, application of isoproterenol, daily injections of triiodothyronine) were characterized in haemodynamic and in metabolic terms. Heart function was evaluated in closed-chest rats after catheterization of the left ventricle with an ultraminiature catheter pressure transducer. Heart rate (HR), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dtmax) were measured. The metabolic parameters determined included the levels of cardiac cyclic AMP and the rates of the biosynthesis of myocardial adenine nucleotides. During the first 72 h after aortic constriction, HR was decreased, whereas LVSP and LV dP/dtmax were both elevated. Within 12 h after administration of isoproterenol, HR and LV dP/dtmax were markedly increased, while LVSP was depressed. In triiodothyronine-treated animals, all haemodynamic parameters were elevated during the first 72 h. Comparison with the time course of changes in metabolic parameters revealed that the rise in cardiac contractility measured as LV dP/dtmax occurred at about the same time as the increase in the content of myocardial cyclic AMP in the isoproterenol- and triiodothyronine-models. In hypertrophy due to aortic constriction, cardiac cyclic AMP was elevated only moderately, and this elevation did not correlate with the enhancement of contractility. Beta-receptor-blockade with propranolol prevented entirely the increase of myocardial adenine nucleotide biosynthesis in the isoproterenol- and triiodothyronine- but not in pressure-induced hypertrophy.
In this study we examined the effect of dopaminergic modulation on learning and memory. Parkinson's patients were tested 'on' versus 'off' dopaminergic medication, using a two-phase learning and transfer task. We found that dopaminergic medication was associated with impaired learning of an incrementally acquired concurrent discrimination task, while patients withdrawn from dopaminergic medication performed as well as controls. In addition, we found a dissociation of the effect of medication within a single two-phase task: patients tested 'on' medication were not impaired at the ability to generalize based on learned information. The deficit among medicated patients appeared to be related specifically to the concurrent, incremental, feedback-based nature of the task: such a deficit was not found in a version of the task in which demands for concurrent error-processing learning were reduced. Taken together with a growing body of evidence emphasizing a role for midbrain dopamine in error-correcting, feedback-based learning processes, the present results suggest a framework for understanding previously conflicting results regarding the effect of medication on learning and memory in Parkinson's disease.
The long term sequelae of hair cell destruction consequent from administration of the ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic, neomycin sulfate, were evaluated in histological and ultrastructural studies of cochlear morphology in cats. Complete hearing loss, as defined by an absence of brainstem evoked responses to click stimulation at 120 dB peak SPL, was induced by intramuscular injections of neomycin at 50 mg/kg body weight/day, and cochlear pathology was studied at 6 months and 1, 3 and 4 years following onset of profound deafness. In these long term ototoxicity cases the organ of Corti was collapsed and resorbed over the basal one-quarter to three-quarters of the cochlear spiral, depending on duration of deafness. Significant progressive reduction in the spiral ganglion cell population and sequential degenerative alterations in the remaining neurons were observed with increasing time elapsed after induced hearing loss. The sequence of pathological alterations in spiral ganglion neurons appeared to be: a) swelling, demyelination and degeneration of the peripheral dendrites; b) demyelination and shrinkage of the cell soma with preservation of the central axon; and c) demyelination of the central axon and degeneration of the cell perikaryon. In apical cochlear regions, severe degeneration of the spiral ganglion preceded the collapse of the tunnel of Corti and regional loss of pillar cells. Residual populations of spiral ganglion neurons were as low as 1-2% of the normal values in the most severely degenerated cochleae in the series. Light microscopic and ultrastructural studies revealed a selective survival advantage for the unmyelinated type II neurons over the myelinated type I neurons with these long survival periods. The prolonged time course and atrophic nature of these pathological alterations suggests that degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons progresses continuously following drug-induced insult to the cochlea. Some possible factors contributing to this long term progressive degeneration will be discussed.
A 56-year-old female patient on verapamil for hypertension experienced two episodes of jaundice, pruritus and upper abdominal pain with transaminase elevated up to six-fold and alkaline phosphatase up to four-fold when inadvertently re-challenged with the drug. Liver biopsy showed marked cholestasis. Verapamil can occasionally cause mixed cytotoxic-cholestatic liver injury.
Whereas muscular rigidity is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine. Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal CO2, intravenous administration of fentanyl (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. Such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. Microinjection of fentanyl (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation. It is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.
Administration of magnesium has been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study examined the effect of magnesium on posttraumatic regional induction of p53, a gene associated with induction of cell death. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g, n = 26) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and subjected to either lateral fluid percussion brain injury of moderate severity (2.4-2.6 atm; n = 22) or sham surgery (n = 4). At 15 min postinjury, animals randomly received an intravenous bolus of either 125 micromol magnesium chloride (n = 12) or saline vehicle (n = 10). Expression of p53 mRNA was not observed in any uninjured animal. By 6 h postinjury in vehicle-treated, brain-injured animals, p53 mRNA was induced in the cortex, dentate hilus, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, ipsilateral to the impact site. Posttraumatic magnesium treatment significantly reduced the number of labeled cells in the injured cortex (P < 0.05), but not in the hippocampus or thalamus. p53 mRNA expression returned to near baseline in all animals by 24 h postinjury. These data suggest that the neuroprotective effects of magnesium treatment may be related, in part, to a downregulation in expression of a gene associated with induction of cell death and further support the utility of magnesium as a pharmacotherapy for TBI.
Although the short-term safety (less than or equal to 6 months) of danazol has been established in a variety of settings, no information exists as to its long-term safety. We therefore investigated the long-term safety of danazol by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with hereditary angioedema treated with danazol for a continuous period of 6 months or longer. The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59.7 months. Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions. Menstrual abnormalities (79%), weight gain (60%), muscle cramps/myalgias (40%), and transaminase elevations (40%) were the most common adverse reactions. The drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients. No patient has died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug. We conclude that, despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions, danazol has proven to be remarkably safe over the long-term in this group of patients.
The aim of the present study was to investigate possible inter-relationships between connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and aldosterone in vascular and renal damage associated with hypertension.
Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated with two doses (100 and 30 mg/kg per day) of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone, or with antihypertensive therapy (HHR) (20 mg/kg per day hydralazine + 7 mg/kg per day hydrochlorothiazide + 0.15 mg/kg per day reserpine).
CTGF mRNA expression and protein levels in the aorta of SHR were upregulated (P < 0.05) compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats. Both doses of eplerenone similarly and significantly diminished CTGF upregulation, correlated with amelioration of aortic remodelling and endothelium-dependent relaxations. Only high-dose eplerenone and HHR significantly reduced arterial blood pressure. HHR treatment also diminished CTGF overexpression, suggesting a blood-pressure-mediated effect in CTGF regulation. This reduction, however, was lower (P < 0.05) than that produced by eplerenone (100 mg/kg per day). The direct effect of aldosterone on vascular smooth muscle cells was also studied. Incubation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells with aldosterone increased CTGF production in a dose-related manner, but was reduced (P < 0.05) by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone. Renal CTGF mRNA and protein levels were higher in SHR than in Wistar-Kyoto rats (P < 0.05), and were similarly diminished by all treatments (P < 0.05).
These data show that aldosterone and haemodynamic stress from elevated blood pressure levels regulate vascular and renal CTGF in SHR. The results suggest that aldosterone, through CTGF stimulation, could participate in vascular and renal structural alterations associated with hypertension, describing a novel mechanism of aldosterone in hypertensive target organ damage.
Dose-related blood dyscrasias during treatment with either chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol chiefly include erythroid suppression and may be recognized at an early stage by observation of reticulocytopenia and an increased serum iron concentration. Ferrokinetic studies show the typical features of sideroblastic anemia. Whilst chloramphenicol is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver, thiamphenicol is predominantly eliminated by the kidney in its unmodified form. Sensitization against both drugs has been described and may, following reexposure, lead to dangerous granulocytopenia. Potentially the most dangerous late complication after chloramphenicol treatment, i.e. aplastic anemia, has not thus far been observed in patients treated with thiamphenicol.
We compared the efficacy and safety of three doses of beraprost sodium, an epoprostenol analogue, with placebo in the treatment of intermittent claudication (Fontaine's stage II). One hundred sixty-four patients were randomized to receive either placebo, 20 micrograms beraprost sodium (BPS60 group), 40 micrograms beraprost sodium (BPS120 group), or 60 micrograms beraprost sodium (BPS180 group) three times daily administered orally in a double-blind manner for 12 weeks. Treadmill exercise tests were performed twice during an initial selection phase (D-28 and D0) at week 10 (at trough beraprost concentration) and week 12 (at peak beraprost concentration) of the treatment phase. At week 10, all groups showed an increase in pain-free walking distance, and this distance was greatest in the BPS60 and BPS120 groups (p = 0.055). At week 12, a similar pattern was observed, and the difference was significant between the groups (p = 0.023). The most frequent adverse events reported were gastrointestinal disorders, headaches, skin disorders, and flushes. Patients who received either 60 or 120 micrograms of beraprost sodium daily had an increased pain-free walking distance. Further studies are required to investigate why the highest dose used (180 micrograms daily) showed lower efficacy. Having both vasodilating and antiplatelet properties and being able to increase pain-free walking distance in the short term, beraprost sodium is a promising drug for the treatment of intermittent claudication.
We report an emergency medical services (EMS) case of self-limited torsade de pointes after administration of droperidol for nausea and vomiting in a patient with potential predisposing factors for the development of prolonged QT interval. Despite the reported association with torsade de pointes, many clinicians still consider droperidol to be a safe medication. Rare cardiac side effects may be avoided by reviewing risk factors for prolonged QT interval in individual patients prior to administering droperidol.
Enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) is reported to play a significant role in neurodegeneration and may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Bicuculline (4 mg/kg; ip), picrotoxin (8 mg/kg; ip) and electroshock (60 mA for 0.2 sec) significantly induced convulsions in male Laka mice. COX-inhibitors viz. nimesulide (2.5 mg/kg; ip) and rofecoxib (2 mg/kg, ip) administered 45 minutes prior to an epileptic challenge prolonged mean onset time of convulsions, decreased duration of clonus and decreased % mortality rate against bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced convulsions in mice. COX-2 inhibitors were ineffective towards maximal electroshock-induced convulsions. Nimesulide (1 mg/kg) and rofecoxib (1 mg/kg) also enhanced the effect of subprotective dose of muscimol against picrotoxin-induced convulsions. The result of the present study strongly suggests for a possible role of cyclooxygenase isoenzymes particularly, COX-2 in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and its GABAergic modulation.
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide. Environmental factors such as xenobiotic exposure and lifestyle and nutrition play a key role in its etiology. This study was designed to evaluate the age-related changes in the expression of major xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) in the rat liver and the mammary gland in the dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced breast cancer model. The influence of dietary lipids on the ontogeny of XMEs was also evaluated. mRNA and protein levels of phase I (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1) and phase II (NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 and GSTP1) enzymes were analyzed, as well as their regulation by AhR and Nrf2, respectively. Results showed differences in the phase I enzymes expression, whereas little changes were obtained in phase II. High corn oil and olive oil diets differentially influenced the expression of age-related changes, suggesting that the different susceptibility to xenobiotic exposure depending upon the age may be modulated by dietary factors.
Maspin, a member of the Serpin protease inhibitor family, is overexpressed in poorly differentiated colorectal tumors and more frequently found in tumors with microsatellite instability. Immunohistochemical nuclear Maspin staining is predominantly seen in tumor cells at the invasion front of such cancers, suggesting that this molecule is associated with local tumor cell infiltration and aggressiveness. In a retrospective study, we studied nuclear Maspin expression as a potential prognostic tool in a total of 172 primary stage III colon cancers by immunohistochemistry. Of those 172 patients, 76 were treated by surgery only, and 96 patients received additional adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy. Nuclear Maspin expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor for overall survival in our patient cohort (hazard ratio 2.08; 95% CI, 1.13-3.81; p = 0.018). However, patients with primary tumors expressing Maspin in the nucleus showed a significant treatment benefit from 5-FU chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.384; 95% CI, 0.188-0.784; p = 0.009) compared to adjuvantly treated patients whose tumors did not express this molecule. Nuclear Maspin expression is highly predictive of 5-FU chemotherapy response in patients with advanced stage colon cancer. Patients with negative immunohistochemical Maspin expression do not benefit from 5-FU treatment and may be candidates for an alternative (non-5-FU based) adjuvant therapy regime.
