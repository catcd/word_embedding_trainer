Dopamine (DA) replacement therapy with l-DOPA remains the standard pharmacotherapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately, chronic l-DOPA treatment is accompanied by development of motor fluctuations and l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). While serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonists acutely reduce these complications, their prophylactic and long-term effects are not well-delineated. To test this, male Sprague-Dawley rats received unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. In experiment 1, l-DOPA-primed rats were pre-treated with Vehicle (0.9% NaCl), various doses of the partial 5-HT(1A) agonist, buspirone (0.25, 1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg, ip) or buspirone (2.5 mg/kg, ip)+the 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg, ip) 5 min prior to l-DOPA (12 mg/kg+15 mg/kg benserazide, ip). Rats were tested for LID using the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) scale and motor performance using the forepaw adjusting steps test (FAS). In experiment 2, l-DOPA-naïve rats received co-administration of l-DOPA+buspirone (1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg, ip) for 2 weeks. AIMs and FAS were measured throughout. In l-DOPA-primed rats, buspirone dose-dependently reduced LID and improved l-DOPA-related motor performance due to action at the 5-HT(1A) receptor. In l-DOPA-naïve rats, buspirone delayed LID development while improving l-DOPA's anti-parkinsonian efficacy indicating the potential long-term benefits of 5-HT(1A) agonists for reduction of l-DOPA-related side effects.
The effect of Bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane (CEM) on myocardial response to ischemia was tested in rats. CEM was dermally applied for 3 days to F344/N male rats, at 0, 100, 400, or 600 mg/kg/d. Subsequently, left ventricular sections were prepared from each rat heart. Part of the sections from each heart were exposed to 90 minutes of simulated ischemia, followed by 90 minutes of reoxygenation. The rest of the sections were continuously oxygenated. Mitochondrial activity was assessed in the sections by the MTT colorimetric assay, reflecting dehydrogenases redox activity. Myocardial toxicity occurred in response to 400 and 600 mg/kg, characterized by myofiber vacuoles, necrosis, and mononuclear infiltrates. The latter dose was lethal. In sections from rats treated with 400 mg/kg CEM, redox activity was decreased by 21% (p<0.01) in oxygenated conditions and by 45% (p<0.01) in ischemia-reoxygenation, compared to controls. Hearts of rats treated with 100 mg/kg/d CEM showed normal histology. Their mitochondrial activity did not differ from that of untreated rat hearts in oxygenated conditions. However, in ischemia-reoxygenation, their redox activity was significantly lower (by 46%, p<0.01) than that of untreated rat hearts. These results demonstrate that subtoxic dosage of a cardiotoxic agent may cause occult cardiotoxicity, reflected by impaired response to ischemia.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) beta/delta-null mice exhibit exacerbated hepatotoxicity in response to administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). To determine whether ligand activation of the receptor protects against chemical toxicity in the liver, wild-type and PPARbeta/delta-null mice were administered CCl(4) with or without coadministration of the highly specific PPARbeta/delta ligand GW0742. Biomarkers of liver toxicity, including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha mRNA, were significantly higher in CCl(4)-treated PPARbeta/delta-null mice compared to wild-type mice. Hepatic expression of TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis receptor (TWEAKr) and S100 calcium-binding protein A6 (S100A6/calcyclin), genes involved in nuclear factor kappa B signaling, was higher in the CCl(4)-treated PPARbeta/delta-null mice compared to wild-type mice. GW0742 treatment resulted in reduced serum ALT concentration and lower expression of CCl(4)-induced TNF-alpha, S100A6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and TWEAKr in wild-type mice, and these effects were not observed in PPARbeta/delta-null mice. Expression of TNF-alpha was higher in PPARbeta/delta-null primary hepatocytes in response to interleukin-1beta treatment compared to wild-type hepatocytes, but GW0742 did not significantly modulate TNF-alpha expression in hepatocytes from either genotype. While PPARbeta/delta-null hepatic stellate exhibited higher rates of proliferation compared to wild-type cells, GW0742 did not affect alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in these cells. Combined, these findings demonstrate that ligand activation of PPARbeta/delta protects against chemically induced hepatotoxicity by downregulating expression of proinflammatory genes. Hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells do not appear to directly mediate the inhibitory effects of ligand activation of PPARbeta/delta in liver, suggesting the involvement of paracrine and autocrine events mediated by hepatic cells.
Females are born with a finite number of primordial follicles. 4-Vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) is a metabolite formed by epoxidation of 4-vinylcyclohexene (VCH) via its two monoepoxides 1,2- and 7,8-4-vinylcyclohexene monoepoxide (VCM). VCD specifically destroys small preantral (primordial and small primary) follicles in the rodent ovary. The phase I enzyme, cytochrome P450 isoform 2E1 (CYP2E1) is involved in ovarian metabolism of VCM to VCD. Further, microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) can detoxify VCD to an inactive tetrol (4-(1,2-dihydroxy)ethyl-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane). This study evaluated the effects of VCD-induced ovotoxicity on mEH in CYP2E1+/+ and -/- mice (129S(1)/SvImJ background strain) using a postnatal day 4 mouse whole ovary culture system. The hypothesis of our study is that there is a relationship between CYP2E1 and mEH gene expression in the mouse ovary. Relative to control, VCD exposure caused follicle loss (p < 0.05) in ovaries from both genotypes; however, after 15 days, this loss was greater (p < 0.05) in CYP2E1+/+ ovaries. In a time course (2-15 days), relative to control, VCD (5 microM) caused an increase (p < 0.05) in mEH mRNA by 0.5-fold (day 10) and 1.84-fold (day 15) in CYP2E1-/- but not +/+ ovaries. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) also destroys ovarian follicles but, unlike VCD, is bioactivated by mEH to an ovotoxic 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide metabolite. Incubation of ovaries in increasing concentrations of DMBA (0.5-1 microM, 15 days) resulted in greater (p < 0.05) follicle loss in CYP2E1-/-, relative to +/+ ovaries. With greater mEH (CYP2E1-/-), increased follicle loss with DMBA (bioactivation) and decreased follicle loss with VCD (detoxification) support that ovarian expression of CYP2E1 and mEH may be linked.
K-ras mutations occur frequently in colon cancer and contribute to autonomous growth. In the azoxymethane (AOM) model of colon cancer, in addition to K-ras mutations, we have shown that wild-type (WT) Ras can be activated by upstream pathways, including, e.g., signaling by ErbB receptors. Tumors with mutant or activated WT Ras had increased cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression. We have also shown that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevented AOM-induced colon cancer and suppressed Cox-2 induction. In this study, we examined the role of Ras in Cox-2 inhibition by UDCA. Rats were fed AIN-76A chow alone, or supplemented with 0.4% UDCA, and received 20 mg/kg AOM i.p. weekly x 2 weeks. At 40 weeks, rats were sacrificed, and tumors were harvested. K-ras mutations were assessed by primer-mediated RFLP, allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, and direct DNA sequencing. Ras was immunoprecipitated and defined as activated if [Ras - GTP/(Ras - GTP + Ras - GDP)] was >3 SD above normal colonocytes. Cox-2 mRNA was determined by reverse transcription-PCR, and protein expression was assessed by Western blotting and immunostaining. In the AOM alone group, Ras was activated by mutations in 8 of 30 (27%) tumors, and WT Ras was activated in 7 of 30 (23%) tumors. UDCA significantly suppressed the incidence of tumors with mutant Ras (1 of 31, 3.2%; P < 0.05) and totally abolished the development of tumors with activated WT Ras (0 of 10; P < 0.05). In the AOM alone group, Cox-2 was up-regulated >50-fold in tumors with normal Ras activity and further enhanced in tumors with mutant or signaling-activated Ras. UDCA significantly inhibited Cox-2 protein and mRNA levels in tumors with normal Ras activity. In summary, we have shown for the first time that UDCA suppressed the development of tumors with Ras mutations and blocked activation of WT Ras. Furthermore, UDCA inhibited Cox-2 induction by Ras-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
Assess the effectiveness and tolerability of a program of gradual dose titration with oxymorphone extended release (ER) for treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain in opioid-naive patients.
Open-label, nonrandomized 6-month study with a titration/stabilization period of <or=1 month followed by a 5-month maintenance period.
Multidisciplinary pain centers in the United States.
Adult opioid-naive patients with moderate to severe chronic pain.
Patients were gradually titrated from a 5-mg dose of oxymorphone ER (taken every 12 hours) to a stabilized dose that provided effective pain relief and was well tolerated.
Brief Pain Inventory Short Form questions 5 and 9, patient and physician global assessments of pain relief, adverse events (AEs), and discontinuations.
The majority (94/126; 75%) of patients were stabilized on a dose of oxymorphone ER that provided effective pain relief with tolerable AEs. Most (81/94; 86%) required <24 days to reach a stable dose. Sixteen percent of patients in the titration period and 17% of patients in the maintenance period discontinued because of AEs possibly or probably related to oxymorphone ER. Patients completing the entire 5-month maintenance period experienced effective pain relief with significant (>50%) reductions of pain interference with quality-of-life measures. There was minimal dose escalation over the 5 months and low use of rescue medication.
Oxymorphone ER provided effective pain relief from moderate to severe chronic pain in opioid-naive patients. Gradual titration was well tolerated, with a low rate of discontinuations caused by AEs.
To review the efficacy, cognitive outcome and safety profile in children treated with vigabatrin (VGB) for infantile spasms (IS) and partial epilepsies related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and other etiologies.
Retrospective review of children followed in the Pediatric Epilepsy Program of Massachusetts General Hospital for Children between May 2001 and March 2006 who were treated with VGB.
Eighty-four children were treated with VGB, 68 of them were treated for IS, and 59 were treated for partial seizures (PS). Etiology (TSC or other) was the only predictive factor for IS control with VGB (p < 0.0003). IS control was achieved in 73% of children with TSC and 27% of children with other etiologies (combined 56%). Partial onset seizures were controlled in 34% of all children, (17% seizure free,17%reduction in seizure frequency >50%) and no predictive factor was found. Shorter time from seizure onset to VGB treatment (p < 0.027) and longer total time on VGB (p < 0.045) was associated with better IQ-developmental quotient (DQ) outcome in children treated for IS, but not with IS control. Adverse events were seen in 13%. Electroretinogram and/or behavioral visual field (VF) testing was done in 52%. VGB was discontinued in one case due to abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) findings.
We confirm the efficacy of VGB in the treatment of IS and PS in an American population. VGB may improve cognitive outcome in the absence of complete IS control, but this finding is of uncertain clinical significance. VGB was well tolerated, and ophthalmologic side effects were uncommon.
Nephrotoxicity is one of the important side effects of antracycline antibiotics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an antioxidant agent, against nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin (DXR).
The rats were divided into control, CAPE alone, doxorubicin (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and doxorubicin plus CAPE (10 micromol/kg/day, i.p.) groups. At the end of the 10th day, kidney tissues were removed for light microscopy and analysis. The levels of tissues protein carbonyl content (PC), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were determined. Plasma oxidants and antioxidants were also measured.
The activities of CAT and GSH-Px were decreased as well as myeloperoxidase, NO, MDA and PC were increased in renal tissue of doxorubicin group compared with the other groups. Plasma GSH-Px activity was higher in doxorubicin plus CAPE group than the others and plasma MDA level was higher in doxorubicin group than the other groups. There were glomerular vacuolization, tubular desquamation, loss of brush border, and adhesion to Bowman's in the light microscopy in the kidneys of doxorubicin group. The tubules and brush border were almost normal and some of the glomerulus was filled with fine vacuoles in CAPE treated rats.
Doxorubicin caused renal injury and CAPE treatment prevented lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in renal tissue and partially preserved glomerulus and tubules.
A critical review of the published cases reports suggests that the muscle changes could be induced by Pentazocine by mechanisms other than local myotoxicity. The mechanism of myotoxicity in Pentazocine-myopathy remains uncertain and for this reason a tissue culture study was performed in order to investigate the close relationship between myopathy and Pentazocine. The effects of Pentazocine on the extent of myogenesis in human foetal muscle cultures were investigated. The phase contrast study, the light microscopy the quantitative assessment of myogenesis (the number of nuclei incorporated into myotubes were counted and expressed as a percentage of the total number of nuclei) showed a complete block of myogenesis in Pentazocine treated culture and a delayed fusion process was present in D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C)-Pentazocine-treated cultures. The present preliminary data, however, suggest that muscle stem cells could participate in the replacement of skeletal muscle by fibrous tissue in neuromuscular syndrome induced by Pentazocine.
A review of misonidazole pharmacokinetics in 83 consecutive patients treated for tumours other than glioma has shown that among patients not receiving enzyme-inducing agents the plasma elimination half life is lower in patients taking steroids. Such a difference is not seen if patients already taking enzyme inducers are given steroids. Five further patients with carcinoma of the lung, treated with radiation over a period of 3 weeks, have been studied in greater detail. Misonidazole, in oral dose of 1 gm-2, was given in conjunction with the first and last radiotherapy fractions, and dexamethasone, in a divided daily dose of 8 mg, was given throughout the radiation treatment, commencing after the first treatment. Misonidazole pharmacokinetics were studied at each administration. Following the dexamethasone treatment period there was a 25% reduction in misonidazole plasma elimination half life, a 24% reduction in plasma AUC0-00, and a 38% increase in 24 h urinary excretion (all changes being statistically significant--P less than 0.005). No changes were observed in the plasma AUC0-24 and urinary excretion of the major metabolite desmethylmisonidazole. Glomerular filtration rates in one patient, before and after treatment with dexamethasone, remained unchanged. These results suggest that the effect of dexamethasone on misonidazole kinetics is not related to an enhancement of demethylation.
The authors postulate mechanisms linking tricyclic antidepressants, QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, and sudden cardiac death. Case reports identify amitriptyline and maprotiline as the tricyclic antidepressants most likely to provoke torsade de pointes. Risk factors of family history of congenital long QT syndrome, age, female sex, metabolic and cardiovascular disease, metabolic inhibitors, hypokalemia, drug overdose, and co-prescription of drugs associated with QT interval prolongation were found in cases of torsade de pointes associated with tricyclic antidepressants. Clinicians should be cautious when prescribing tricyclic antidepressants with other drugs, such as thioridazine, that are capable of prolonging the QT interval.
To determine the optimal postoperative interval after which heparin therapy can be safely initiated, a rat model for experimental craniotomy and corticectomy was developed. In 50 rats (100 lesions), heparin therapy was initiated 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days after standardized bilateral frontal corticectomy and was continued for 7 days. Intraperitoneally administered heparin, 75 to 100 U/kg.h, was continuously given to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time in one of two ranges: therapeutic (1.5-3 times control) or supratherapeutic (> 3 times control). The size of intracranial hemorrhage was determined from coronal brain sections by automated image analysis. No significant hemorrhage was observed in control (saline infusion) animals or in rats receiving therapeutic doses of heparin beginning more than 24 hours after surgery. Small (10-50 mm3) and large (> 50 mm3) hemorrhages were frequent at all intervals up to 5 days in animals with supratherapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (P < 0.01). Judicious heparin therapy may be safely initiated at 48 hours after craniotomy and corticectomy in rats, whereas supratherapeutic anticoagulation is associated with intracranial hemorrhage at intervals of up to 5 days.
The generation, transmission (e.g. power lines, transformers, service wires, and electrical panels), and use (e.g. home appliances, such as electric blankets, shavers, and televisions) of electrical energy is associated with the production of weak electric and magnetic fields (EMF) which oscillate 50 (Europe) or 60 (USA) times per second (power-line frequency), falling in the extremely-low frequency (ELF) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Epidemiological reports suggest a possible association between exposure to ELF-EMF and an increased risk of cancer (e.g. childhood acute leukaemia). Benzene is an established human leukomogen. This xenobiotic, which is unlikely to be the ultimate carcinogen, is metabolized in the liver to its primary metabolite phenol, which is hydroxylated to hydroquinone (1,4-benzenediol) and 1,2,4-benzenetriol. In this in vitro approach, to test the genotoxic and / or co-genotoxic potency of ELF-EMF, the cytokinesis block micronucleus (MN) method with Jurkat cells has been used. A 50 Hz magnetic field (MF) of 5 mT field strength was applied for different length of time (from 1 to 24 h), either alone or with benzene, 1,4-benzenediol, or 1,2,4-benzenetriol. Our preliminary results show that, after 24 h exposure, the frequency of micronucleated cells in MF-exposed cultures is 1.9 fold higher than in sham-exposed (control) cultures. Benzene exposure does not show any cytogenetic activity, whereas 1,4-benzenediol or 1,2,4-benzenetriol alone significantly affect the number of MN in Jurkat cells, as compared to untreated cultures. Moreover, co-exposure to ELF-MF does not seem to affect the frequency of micronuclei induced by benzene, 1,4-benzenediol, or 1,2,4-benzenetriol.
Phenylpropanolamine is commonly found in appetite suppressants and cough or cold remedies. Case reports have linked the use of products containing phenylpropanolamine to hemorrhagic stroke, often after the first use of these products. To study the association, we designed a case-control study.
Men and women 18 to 49 years of age were recruited from 43 U.S. hospitals. Eligibility criteria included the occurrence of a subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage within 30 days before enrollment and the absence of a previously diagnosed brain lesion. Random-digit dialing identified two matched control subjects per patient.
There were 702 patients and 1376 control subjects. For women, the adjusted odds ratio was 16.58 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.51 to 182.21; P=0.02) for the association between the use of appetite suppressants containing phenylpropanolamine and the risk of a hemorrhagic stroke and 3.13 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 11.46; P=0.08) for the association with the first use of a product containing phenylpropanolamine. All first uses of phenylpropanolamine involved cough or cold remedies. For men and women combined, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.49 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.84 to 2.64; P=0.17) for the association between the use of a product containing phenylpropanolamine and the risk of a hemorrhagic stroke, 1.23 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 2.24; P=0.49) for the association with the use of cough or cold remedies that contained phenylpropanolamine, and 15.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.38 to 184.13; P=0.03) for the association with the use of appetite suppressants that contained phenylpropanolamine. An analysis in men showed no increased risk of a hemorrhagic stroke in association with the use of cough or cold remedies containing phenylpropanolamine. No men reported the use of appetite suppressants.
The results suggest that phenylpropanolamine in appetite suppressants, and possibly in cough and cold remedies, is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke in women.
Results in a series of 60 patients with recurrent or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder confirm that methotrexate is active as a single agent. Over-all, 43 per cent of the patients with measurable metastases and 28 per cent with recurrent primary tumors responded for an average of 6 months. Response rates in both groups were influenced by the stage of the primary tumor.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a long-term, recurrent condition that often takes a chronic course. It seems imperative that research should be focused on gaining a better understanding of what predicts recurrent MDD. As a major mediator of the stress response, corticotropin-releasing-hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) has been demonstrated to be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of MDD. In this study, we show a significant increase in the G-allele (rs242939) of the CRHR1 gene in the recurrent MDD group compared with the control group, and an overrepresentation of G-G-T hyplotype of the CRHR1 gene in recurrent MDD. We also demonstrate the interaction of the CRHR1 gene and negative life events in recurrent MDD. These results suggest that the CRHR1 gene could modify the susceptibility to developing recurrent MDD following negative life events in adulthood.
Deanol and placebo were administered to 10 parkinsonian patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias in a double-blind, crossover fashion. Deanol and placebo did not differ significantly in their effects on dyskinesias. The reported properties of deanol seem to be attributable to a placebo effect. There was no correlation with the results of the physostigmine test. Despite these disappointing results deanol remains intriguing, because in individual cases remarkable improvements on dyskinesias are reported.
Phenylbutazone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that was commonly prescribed for the treatment of arthritic conditions; it is no longer available for use in humans because of its numerous side effects, including aplastic anemia. We describe a horse trainer who developed gastric ulcers and renal insufficiency as a result of taking veterinary phenylbutazone. A review of the literature reveals a pattern of abuse by those who work with and around animals. When appropriate, patients who work around animals should be questioned about illicit phenylbutazone consumption.
Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent with insulin-sensitizing activities that was withdrawn from the market in 2000 due to its association with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. To address the suspected autoantibody production associated with troglitazone, we investigated autoantibodies in sera from patients with type II diabetes mellitus with troglitazone-induced liver dysfunction. Two female patients (47- and 70-year-old) ceased taking troglitazone (400 mg/day) after 23.5 and 16 weeks, respectively, due to increased serum ALT. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and amino acid sequence analyses, aldolase B was identified as an autoantigen that reacted with antibodies in sera from both patients. The titer of anti-aldolase B remained high for several weeks after stopping troglitazone administration. The mean reactivity of autoantibodies to aldolase B determined by ELISA with sera of patients with chronic hepatitis (n = 40) and liver cirrhosis (n = 40) was significantly higher (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) than with sera of healthy subjects (n = 80). These findings suggest that liver injury may cause the appearance of autoantibodies to aldolase B which may then aggravate the hepatitis. In addition, the anti-aldolase B titer might indicate the severity of liver dysfunction.
The tuberous sclerosis (TSC) genes, TSC1 and TSC2, encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively, and are putative tumor suppressor genes that were originally identified due to their involvement in the inherited autosomal dominant disorder tuberous sclerosis. It has been elucidated that the two proteins form an intracellular heterodimer participating in signaling pathway of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). Recent studies showed that mTOR pathway was frequently activated in blasts from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient and associated with proliferation, survival, and drug-resistance of these cells. These phenomena led us to hypothesize that TSC gene might be involved in acute leukemia (AL). In this study, we investigated the TSC1 and TSC2 mRNA expression in 104 newly diagnosed AL patients and 29 healthy controls using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) and explored the potential mechanisms of the aberrant expression through methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The results showed that the expression of TSC2 was downregulated in AL patients and the TSC2 promoter was hypermethylated which might be an important mechanism for the downregulation of TSC2 expression.
Fluoride inhibits photohemolysis induced by chloroaluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (AlPcS4) when it is added to dye-loaded human erythrocytes prior to light exposure (E. Ben-Hur, A. Freud, A. Canfi, and A. Livne, Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 59, 797-806, 1991). This is due to formation of a complex of F- with Al3+, leading to selective release and/or modified dye binding with some proteins so that the effective photochemical reaction is prevented. In this work we used F- as a probe to evaluate the involvement of the plasma membrane functions of Chinese hamster ovary cells in photocytotoxicity induced by chloroaluminum phthalocyanine (AlPc). Fluoride was found to protect against killing of cells photosensitized by AlPc but not AlPcS4. Plasma membrane damage induced by AlPc photosensitization was manifested by K+ leakage, membrane depolarization, inhibition of glucose and amino acid uptake, and Na+/K(+)-ATPase inactivation. The latter enzyme system was found to be the one most sensitive to inhibition by the combination of AlPc and PDT among the membrane functions studied, and was completely protected by F- in the dose range at which up to 95% of the cells are killed. Of the other membrane functions only glucose transport was slightly protected by F-. It is concluded that damage to the plasma membrane is involved in cell killing induced by AlPc photosensitization and that the plasma membrane enzyme Na+/K(+)-ATPase is a probable candidate as a critical target.
Four patients with akathisia as a result of neuroleptic administration were treated with amantadine. Although substantial improvement occurred initially, all four patients developed tolerance to this therapeutic effect within 1 week. An increase in dosage also had only a transient effect. The rapid development of tolerance significantly limits the usefulness of amantadine in the treatment of akathisia. One patient who suffered from akathisia and drug-induced parkinsonism experienced significant attenuation of both movement disorders in response to treatment with amantadine. Although she became tolerant to the effect of amantadine on her akathisia within the first week of treatment, her parkinsonism did not recur. The possibility that these two neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes are pharmacologically separable is discussed.
Sex differences in the potency of the antinociceptive effects of kappa opioids have been reported in various acute pain models with evidence suggesting that these sex differences are mediated by activity in the N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) system.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate sex differences in the antihyperalgesic actions of selected kappa and mixed-action opioids in a persistent pain model and determine if the NMDA system modulates these effects in a sexually dimorphic manner.
Using gonadally intact male and female F344 rats, hyperalgesia was induced by local administration of capsaicin in the tail, after which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus (45 degrees C water), and tail-withdrawal latency measured. Opioids were then administered systemically (s.c.) and locally (in the tail) alone, and in selected combinations with the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan.
When administered systemically and locally, the kappa opioids spiradoline, U69,593 and U50,488, and the mixed-action opioids butorphanol and nalbuphine, produced dose-dependent antihyperalgesic effects. Whereas the kappa opioids were generally more potent in males, sex differences were not observed with the mixed-action opioids. Peripheral receptor activity was confirmed for local administration of kappa opioids by the antagonism observed after local, but not intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), administration of the kappa antagonist nor-binaltorphamine (nor-BNI). Dextromethorphan was equally potent in attenuating the antihyperalgesia induced by kappa opioids in both males and females.
These findings demonstrate sex differences in kappa opioid activity in a persistent pain model. Although an NMDA antagonist blocked the effects of kappa opioids in this model, these effects were not sexually dimorphic as reported in most acute pain models.
The authors describe a patient with major affective disorder, unipolar depressed type, recurrent, psychosis who went into a catatonic stupor state while being treated with maprotiline hydrochloride and thiothixene. The article also deals with findings on electroencephalogram, response to treatment, a review of other similar case reports, and the clinical significance and relevance based upon which other clinicians can take some precautionary measures while prescribing this newer antidepressant, especially in combination with a neuroleptic.
Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone, supine and erect, and urinary aldosterone levels were measured in 18 patients on normal sodium diets and 11 patients on low sodium diets, all of whom also were on long-term levodopa therapy. Of the 230 hormone measurements, 185 were normal, 11 were high, and 34 were low. Most of the low levels were in 3 patients who had recently received fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension, and the renin-aldosterone systems might have been suppressed by it. In another phase of this study, 4 subjects were maintained on a constant diet for 6 wk, while the effect of gradually increasing dosages of levodopa on mineral balance and renin-aldosterone was determined. In 3 of the 4 patients there was a mild natriuretic effect of levodopa (previously demonstrated for acute levodopa therapy). There were no significant consistent changes in renin or aldosterone levels while levodopa was being administered. These studies indicate that levodopa does not usually suppress the elements of the renin-aldosterone system and that such a mechanism is unlikely to be the cause of orthostatic hypotension during the course of levodopa therapy. Since levodopa may induce natriuresis, in this situation unchanged lvels of renin and aldosterone may, however, represent an inappropriately low set of this hormonal system.
