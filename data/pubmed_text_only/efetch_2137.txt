B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells express several members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, such as CD40L, CD30L, and TRAIL. By using the cDNA microarray technology, B-CLL samples were found to overexpress receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) ligand (RANKL), as compared to normal CD19(+) B cells. These findings were validated at the protein level by Western blot and flow cytometry analyses. Moreover, unlike primary normal B cells, leukemic B-CLL cells showed surface expression of RANK, the cognate transmembrane receptor of RANKL. When added in vitro to B-CLL cultures, either alone or in association with chlorambucil or fludarabine, recombinant RANKL did not significantly modulate cell viability, and it minimally affected the IL-8 expression/release. On the other hand, treatment with RANK-Fc chimera potently upregulated the release of IL-8 in the B-CLL culture supernatants, suggesting involvement of reverse signaling through transmembrane RANKL in IL-8 induction. In turn, exposure of B-CLL cells to recombinant IL-8 significantly decreased spontaneous apoptosis as well as chlorambucil- and fludarabine-mediated cytoxicity in B-CLL cells. Since IL-8 has been implicated in progression of B-CLL disease, our findings suggest that, by upregulating IL-8, the RANKL/RANK system may contribute to the pathogenesis of B-CLL.
We report a case of abdominal pain with rigidity, mimicking an acute abdomen, caused by metoclopramide, a common anti-emetic drug. Extrapyramidal symptoms are commonly reported side-effects of this medication. They generally include involuntary movements of limbs, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus, etc. Abdominal rigidity due to this medication, resembling an acute abdomen, has not been reported previously. This case report illustrates the importance of considering medication side-effects when evaluating a patient with abdominal pain and rigidity.
We compared sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension with 3% isoflurane-induced hypotension with regard to brain tissue oxygen pressure (PtO(2)), middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow, and cerebral arteriovenous shunting. Eight dogs were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane. After a craniotomy, a probe was inserted into the left frontoparietal brain cortex to mea-sure tissue gases and pH. Blood flow was measured in a secondary branch of the MCA by a flowprobe. Measurements were made during baseline 1.5% isoflurane, during 1.5% isoflurane and SNP-induced hypotension or 3% isoflurane-induced hypotension to a mean pressure of 60-65 mm Hg, and during continued treatment with SNP or 3% isoflurane with blood pressure support to baseline levels with phenylephrine. Shunting was calculated from arterial, sagittal sinus, and tissue (indicating capillary) oxygen content. During hypotension with SNP, PtO(2) decreased 50%, and shunting increased 50%. During hypotension with 3% isoflurane, PtO(2) and shunting did not change. Blood pressure support increased PtO(2) and MCA flow during both SNP and 3% isoflurane treatment. These results show that SNP is a cerebrovasodilator but that hypotension will decrease PtO(2), probably because of an increase in arteriovenous shunting and a decrease in capillary perfusion.
We measured brain arteriovenous shunting and tissue oxygen pressure(PtO(2))during a 40% decrease in blood pressure induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP)or 3% isoflurane. Large-dose isoflurane maintainedPtO(2) with no change in shunting. SNP infusion decreasedPtO(2) 50%and increased shunting 50%. This suggests that SNP-induced hypotension decreases PtO(2) because of a decrease in capillary perfusion.
Four distinct MAP kinase signaling pathways involving 7 MEK enzymes have been identified. MEK1 and MEK2 are the prototype members of MEK family proteins. Several MEK inhibitors are in clinical trials. Trametinib is being evaluated by FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation. Selumetinib has been studied in combination with docetaxel in phase II randomized trial in previously treated patients with advanced lung cancer. Selumetinib group had better response rate and progression-free survival. This review also summarized new MEK inhibitors in clinical development, including pimasertib, refametinib, PD-0325901, TAK733, MEK162 (ARRY 438162), RO5126766, WX-554, RO4987655 (CH4987655), GDC-0973 (XL518), and AZD8330.
During 31 months of study, 808 patients with polymicrobial surgical infection were randomized for antibiotic therapy between a third-generation cephalosporin (moxalactam disodium [149], cefotaxime sodium [125], and cefoperazone sodium [141]) and the combination of gentamicin sulfate plus clindamycin (393). Results based on antibiotic therapy included the following: cure in 83% given cephalosporin, 73% with antibiotic combination; control but recurrent sepsis in 7% and 15%; and failure in 4% and 8%, respectively. Such data support the tenet that third-generation cephalosporins are at least equal, if not superior, to the combination of gentamicin plus clindamycin for treatment of polymicrobial surgical sepsis.
Agonist ligands for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma have been shown to induce terminal differentiation of normal preadipocytes and human liposarcoma cells in vitro. Because the differentiation status of liposarcoma is predictive of clinical outcomes, modulation of the differentiation status of a tumor may favorably impact clinical behavior. We have conducted a clinical trial for treatment of patients with advanced liposarcoma by using the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ligand troglitazone, in which extensive correlative laboratory studies of tumor differentiation were performed. We report here the results of three patients with intermediate to high-grade liposarcomas in whom troglitazone administration induced histologic and biochemical differentiation in vivo. Biopsies of tumors from each of these patients while on troglitazone demonstrated histologic evidence of extensive lipid accumulation by tumor cells and substantial increases in NMR-detectable tumor triglycerides compared with pretreatment biopsies. In addition, expression of several mRNA transcripts characteristic of differentiation in the adipocyte lineage was induced. There was also a marked reduction in immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation. Together, these data indicate that terminal adipocytic differentiation was induced in these malignant tumors by troglitazone. These results indicate that lineage-appropriate differentiation can be induced pharmacologically in a human solid tumor.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNB) has poor prognosis and moreover patients with TNB do not benefit from established targeted drugs with endocrine therapy or trastuzumab. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of candidate biomarkers in tumors from patients with TNB. Tissue microarrays were prepared from primary tumors from premenopausal breast cancer patients (500/564) randomized to adjuvant tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining included ER, PR, HER2, epidermal receptor growth factor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). EGFR and HER2 gene copy number was defined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All patients were included in the descriptive analysis, but only untreated patients in the survival analysis. TNB was diagnosed in 96 patients and correlated significantly to low age, Nottingham histological grade (NHG) III, high Ki67-index, T2 tumors, node negativity, EGFR positivity, increased EGFR gene copy number and high VEGFR2 expression. TNB was an independent prognostic factor for decreased 5-year breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) (HR 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.6), P = 0.01), but not for 10-year BCSS. High VEGFR2 expression was significantly correlated to decreased BCSS in TNB patients. TNB was associated with decreased BCSS and clinicopathological characteristics of an aggressive tumor type. High VEGFR2 expression, EGFR expression, and EGFR gene copy number were significantly correlated to TNB, supporting their role as putative candidate biomarkers for selection of targeted therapy in TNB.
Healthy colonocytes derive 60-70% of their energy supply from short-chain fatty acids, particularly butyrate. Butyrate has profound effects on differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells by regulating expression of various genes associated with these processes. We have previously shown that butyrate is transported across the luminal membrane of the colonic epithelium via a monocarboxylate transporter, MCT1. In this paper, using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation histochemistry, we have determined the profile of MCT1 protein and mRNA expression along the crypt to surface axis of healthy human colonic tissue. There is a gradient of MCT1 protein expression in the apical membrane of the cells along the crypt-surface axis rising to a peak in the surface epithelial cells. MCT1 mRNA is expressed along the crypt-surface axis and is most abundant in cells lining the crypt. Analysis of healthy colonic tissues and carcinomas using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting revealed a significant decline in the expression of MCT1 protein during transition from normality to malignancy. This was reflected in a corresponding reduction in MCT1 mRNA expression, as measured by Northern analysis. Carcinoma samples displaying reduced levels of MCT1 were found to express the high affinity glucose transporter, GLUT1, suggesting that there is a switch from butyrate to glucose as an energy source in colonic epithelia during transition to malignancy. The expression levels of MCT1 in association with GLUT1 could potentially be used as determinants of the malignant state of colonic tissue.
The oxazaphosphorines cyclophosphamide (CP) and ifosfamide (IF) are alkylating agents that require bioactivation via cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoenzymes including CYP2C9 enzymes. The present study investigated CYP2C9 in regard to its allelic variants in 23 tumor samples (10 breast tumors, 1 breast tumor cell line, 5 brain tumors, 7 glioma cell lines) with restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR). The mutant alleles of CYP2C9 were residue 144 (Arg (*1)/Cys (*2)), residue 358 (Tyr/Cys), residue 359 (Ile/Leu (*3)) and residue 417 (Gly/Asp). The frequencies of the CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles in the cancer samples examined were found to be 0.848, 0.152 and 0.043, respectively. No sample revealed a mutation at residue 358 or 417. Comparing breast with brain tumors, brain tumors seemed to reveal a higher incidence of heterozygotes (5/12 compared to 2/11) at residue 144 and, with regard to residue 359, a lower incidence of heterozygotes (0/12 compared to 2/11). In summary, our data indicate that in tumor material, as in healthy material, the same allelic variants of CYP2C9 occur. Compared to healthy tissue, tumor material seemed to reveal a higher incidence of the *2 allele, but a significant difference could not be established. Our results show that brain and breast tumor samples appeared to differ in their frequency of heterozygotes at residues 144 and 359. This might also have an impact on intratumoral oxazaphosphorine metabolism.
(+/-) and (+), but not (-) S9871 are new alpha 2-adrenoceptor selective antagonists. The effect of the racemic mixture and of the stereoisomers on cardiovascular and sedative responses to clonidine have been studied in rats and chickens, respectively. Blockade of central alpha 2-adrenoceptors was also measured as a recovery of the sympathoinhibitory effect induced by intravenous administration of B-HT 933 (azepexole). The potency profiles of these agents established in the central nervous system were confirmed in studies using the vas deferens in situ in the pithed rat. (+/-) and (+) S9871 blocked and antagonized some centrally mediated effects of clonidine such as the depressor response to both intravenous and intracerebroventricular administration. However, the return of arterial pressure to the control value, after intravenous administration of (-) S9871, does not result from an antagonistic action on alpha 2-adrenoceptors, since the depressor effects of clonidine were not blocked, but could be explained by alpha-agonistic properties of (-) S9871. (+/-) and (+) S9871 also blocked and antagonized the hypotensive and bradycardic action induced by intravenous administration of B-HT 933. The loss of the righting reflex induced by clonidine in the chicken was prevented by (+/-) and (+) S9871, as shown by a shift of the dose-response curve to clonidine to the right by both agents; on the contrary, (-) S9871 potentiated the sedation induced by clonidine. In the pithed rat, intravenously administered (+/-) and (+) S9871 fully antagonized the inhibitory effects of clonidine on the electrically induced contractions of the vas deferens. These observations are consistent with a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptors antagonistic effect of (+/-) and (+) S9871 at central and peripheral alpha 2-adrenoceptors.

Opioids occupy a position of unsurpassed clinical utility in the treatment of pain of many etiologies. However, recent reports in laboratory animals and humans have documented the occurrence of hyperalgesia when the administration of opioids is abruptly tapered or discontinued, a condition known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). In these studies we documented that rats administered morphine (40 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) for 6 days) via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps demonstrated thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia for several days after the cessation of morphine administration. Additional experiments using a rat model of incisional pain showed that that attributable to OIH were additive with the hyperalgesia and allodynia that resulted from incision. In our final experiments we observed that if naloxone is administered chronically before incision then discontinued (20 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) for 6 days), the hyperalgesia and allodynia that result from hind paw incision was markedly reduced. In contrast, naloxone 1 mg/kg administered acutely after hind paw incision increased hyperalgesia and allodynia. We conclude that the chronic administration of exogenous opioid receptor agonists and antagonists before incision can alter the hyperalgesia and allodynia observed in this pain model, perhaps by altering intrinsic opioidergic systems involved in setting thermal and mechanical nociceptive thresholds.
The chronic administration of opioids followed by abrupt cessation can lead to a state of hyperalgesia. In these studies we demonstrate that the hyperalgesia from opioid cessation and from hind paw incision are additive in rats. We suggest that failure to take into consideration preoperative opioid use can lead to excessive postoperative pain.
The objectives of the study was to determine whether salivary progesterone (P) or estriol (E3) concentration at 16-20 weeks' gestation predicts preterm birth or the response to 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17OHPC) and whether 17OHPC treatment affected the trajectory of salivary P and E3 as pregnancy progressed.
This was a secondary analysis of a clinical trial of 17OHPC to prevent preterm birth. Baseline saliva was assayed for P and E3. Weekly salivary samples were obtained from 40 women who received 17OHPC and 40 who received placebo in a multicenter randomized trial of 17OHPC to prevent recurrent preterm delivery.
Both low and high baseline saliva P and E3 were associated with a slightly increased risk of preterm birth. However, 17OHPC prevented preterm birth comparably, regardless of baseline salivary hormone concentrations. 17OHPC did not alter the trajectory of salivary P over pregnancy, but it significantly blunted the rise in salivary E3 as well as the rise in the E3/P ratio.
17OHPC flattened the trajectory of E3 in the second half of pregnancy, suggesting that the drug influences the fetoplacental unit.
Clopidogrel, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, was initially thought to be free of the side-effects of ticlopidine. We describe a man who developed aplastic anaemia after 5 months of treatment with clopidogrel. There were no other plausible causes. We suggest that his fatal aplastic anaemia might have been induced by clopidogrel.
Prophylactic administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (600mg orally twice daily), along with hydration, prevents contrast agent-associated nephrotoxicity (CAN) induced by a low dose of non-ionic, low-osmolality contrast dye. We tested whether a double dose of NAC is more effective to prevent CAN.
Two-hundred-twenty-four consecutive patients with chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine level > or =1.5mg/dl and/or creatinine clearance <60ml/min), referred to our institution for coronary and/or peripheral procedures, were randomly assigned to receive 0.45% saline intravenously and NAC at the standard dose (600mg orally twice daily; SD Group; n=110) or at a double dose (1200mg orally twice daily; DD Group; n=114) before and after a non-ionic, low-osmolality contrast dye administration. Increase of at least 0.5mg/dl of the creatinine concentration 48h after the procedure occurred in 12/109 patients (11%) in the SD Group and 4/114 patients (3.5%) in the DD Group (P=0.038; OR=0.29; 95% CI=0.09-0.94). In the subgroup with low (<140ml, or contrast ratio <=1) contrast dose, no significant difference in renal function deterioration occurred between the 2 groups. In the subgroup with high (> or =140ml, or contrast ratio >1) contrast dose, the event was significantly more frequent in the SD Group. Conclusions Double dose of NAC seems to be more effective than the standard dose in preventing CAN, especially with high volumes of non-ionic, low-osmolality contrast agent.
The authors report on a case of cardiotoxicity observed during a protocol including a 5-day continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil; anginal manifestations recurred during a second treatment course. Coronary angiography, thallium scintigraphy and methergine test were all normal. An attempt to prevent the recurrence of such manifestations using a calcium inhibitor and nitroderivatives was unsuccessful. In connection with this case, six other with anginal manifestation and four sudden deaths under the same protocol, a review of the relevant literature is included in the discussion on the factors that may favor cardiotoxicity and the different etiopathogenic hypothesis. The generally accepted hypothesis is a coronary spasm but a direct cardiotoxicity of 5-FU cannot be. The only therapeutic possibility appears to be the definitive halt of 5-FU after the onset of such manifestations.
Bilateral thumb burns on a young woman admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia led us to consider the diagnosis of crack lung despite the fact that the woman denied cocaine use. Cocaine was found on a urine toxicology study, and its use was subsequently confirmed by history. The patient was treated for crack lung with complete resolution of her symptoms and radiographic findings. Inspection of the hands for burns consistent with handling cocaine pipes should prompt a consideration of crack lung in patients with pulmonary infiltrates.
Atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, affecting 10-20% of children and 1-3% of adults. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the clinical and anti-inflammatory effect of bacterial and ribosomal immunotherapy with Immucytal (Pierre Fabre Médicament, France) in children with AEDS.
Seventeen children with allergic and non-allergic forms of AEDS (AAEDS and NAAEDS, respectively), graded moderate to severe (Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD] index of >25), received ribosomal immunotherapy (Immucytal) once daily according to the standard treatment regimen (4 consecutive days a week for 3 weeks, and then 4 consecutive days a month for 4 months). We assessed the clinical status of AEDS using the SCORAD index at baseline, and after 8 and 20 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, peripheral blood from patients was examined for the frequencies of CD4+ cells expressing interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-4 using flow cytometry.
There was a progressive and significant clinical improvement of AEDS, confirmed by a reduction of the SCORAD index over time in both AEDS forms (p < 0.01). Pooled data from the two groups showed that the mean baseline index of 43 was reduced to 17 after treatment. Overall, these data indicate a marked improvement in total clinical severity of AEDS (-62%). Flow cytometry analysis showed that frequencies of the two CD4+ T cell subsets did not differ significantly from the beginning to the end of the study in both forms of AEDS. However, the percentage of CD4+ cells expressing IL-4 in children with AAEDS tended to decrease by the end of treatment with ribosomal immunotherapy. Clinical and laboratory data confirmed that immunotherapy was well tolerated.
The results of this pilot investigation suggest that ribosomal immunotherapy may be beneficial in the management of AEDS in children, and that this could be at least partially explained by a role in restoring the type 2 helper-T cell imbalance seen in allergic patients. Placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials are recommended in order to confirm these findings.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are expressed on vascular tissue. To investigate the direct vasoprotective effects of PPARgamma and PPARalpha ligands, pioglitazone (3 mg/kg/day) and bezafibrate (10 mg/kg/day) were given by gavage to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 4 weeks. Streptozotocin (65 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased NADPH oxidase, vascular call adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and osteopontin mRNA levels in the aorta, as determined by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of osteopontin protein was also enhanced in the streptozotocin-injected rat aorta. Pioglitazone or bezafibrate attenuated the streptozotocin-induced increase in the expression of NADPH oxidase and VCAM-1 mRNA. The enhanced expression of osteopontin gene and protein induced by streptozotocin was suppressed by pioglitazone, whereas treatment with bezafibrate had no effect on the expression of osteopontin. We also demonstrated that pioglitazone or bezafibrate prevented the streptozotocin-induced increase in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene and protein content, by the means of RT-PCR and Western blotting. On the other hand, the treatment of pioglitazone or bezafibrate in the present study did not affect glucose tolerance, serum insulin or lipid level in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. These results suggest that the direct anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of PPARs ligands in the aorta of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were not likely to have been mediated by the normalization of glucose or lipid metabolism, but instead these salutary effects appear to have been associated with the inhibition of the expression of ACE. In addition, pioglitazone appeared to be more effective on the suppression of osteopontin expression compared with bezafibrate.
Cisplatin exerts an additional influence on myocardial ischemia induced by the cardiovascular effects of etoposide. Two cases of myocardial ischemia related to combination chemotherapy with methotrexate, etoposide and cisplatin are reported. While the major toxicity associated with systemic chemotherapy is hematologic, it is suggested that, in elderly patients with increased incidence of atherosclerotic disease, special attention be given to vascular complications of antineoplastic agents.
We determined the sequence specific efficacy of gefitinib and docetaxel treatment for bladder cancer. This combination was selected because it is currently under study in a phase II clinical trial.
In vitro antiproliferative effects of gefitinib, docetaxel and a combination were determined in the 4 bladder cancer cell lines 253J B-V, UM-UC-3, KU-7 and UM-UC-13 by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell cycle analysis was analyzed using flow cytometry and propidium iodide labeling. Epidermal growth factor receptor downstream signaling was assessed by Western blot analysis. In vivo nude mice were injected subcutaneously with 253J B-V cells and treated with placebo, gefitinib, docetaxel, docetaxel followed by gefitinib or gefitinib followed by docetaxel. Tumor kinetics were established.
Gefitinib demonstrated antiproliferative effect against 253J B-V cells (50% inhibitory concentration less than 0.5 muM) but no apoptotic effect in vitro, whereas docetaxel demonstrated antiproliferative and apoptotic effects. When gefitinib and docetaxel were combined, gefitinib enhanced the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of docetaxel only when gefitinib was administered following docetaxel pretreatment. Apoptosis increased from 45% to 66%. In vivo there were significant differences in tumor weight in mice treated with combination therapy vs gefitinib or docetaxel alone. Importantly improved efficacy was observed when docetaxel was followed by gefitinib administration compared with gefitinib followed by docetaxel (mean tumor weight 42 vs 93 mg, p = 0.022). Sequence specific efficacy was not observed in UM-UC-3, UM-UC-13 and KU-7 cells, which are resistant to gefitinib.
Docetaxel followed by gefitinib demonstrated sequence specific efficacy against gefitinib sensitive bladder cancer compared with gefitinib followed by docetaxel or either drug alone. Accordingly gefitinib administration concurrently or after chemotherapy might be the sequence of choice and it should be considered for future clinical trials.
We have previously reported that a C/A single nucleotide polymorphism at position -160 of the human E-cadherin gene promoter affects E-cadherin transcription. Although this single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with a number of human cancers, including prostate cancer, it is not known whether it has a role in race related prostate cancer. We hypothesized that allelic variation at this site may be associated with racial differences in the incidence and severity of prostate cancer.
We analyzed the genotypes of this single nucleotide polymorphism in a total of 135 prostate cancer samples from 86 white and 49 black American men, and in 237 samples from normal healthy controls, including 120 white and 117 black men, using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique.
Of normal controls black men had a higher frequency of the A allele and CA genotype than white men (26.5 and 39.3 vs 22.5 and 28.3, respectively). In white men A allele frequency was significantly higher in those with prostate cancer than in controls (p <0.05). White men carrying the A allele and AA genotype were at 1.99-fold (95% CI 1.29 to 3.08) and 3.04-fold (95% CI 1.26 to 7.32) higher risk for prostate cancer than carriers of the C allele and CC genotype. However, in black men the A allele was more frequent in controls than in patients with cancer and it was associated with a 2.4-fold decrease in prostate cancer risk (95% CI 0.22 to 0.81) compared to the C allele.
The A allele of the E-cadherin -160 single nucleotide polymorphism represents a prostate cancer risk factor in white but not in black men.
