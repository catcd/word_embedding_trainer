To develop a clinical decision model to compare the outcome of therapy with digoxin versus diltiazem for short-term control of ventricular response rate (VRR) in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.
Review of data from two studies that examined the percentages of response and frequency of adverse reactions in patients treated with intravenous digoxin or diltiazem to control VRR in atrial fibrillation or flutter. We constructed a clinical decision model and performed sensitivity analysis to determine if the model's predictions could be altered.
Large teaching, university hospitals.
Adults age 18 years or older treated with intravenous digoxin or intravenous diltiazem for atrial fibrillation or flutter (VRR > or = 120 beats/min). Patients with severe heart failure New York Heart Association class III or IV, a surgical procedure prior to the exacerbation, or an acute myocardial infarction were excluded.
We measured VRR control after 1 and 24 hours of therapy (VRR < 100 beats/min or decrease of > or = 20%) and assessed the likelihood that a patient would suffer an adverse drug reaction. Initial assumptions were that the probability digoxin would achieve VRR control was 0.10 (95% confidence interval 0.04-0.20) at 1 hour and 0.70 (95% CI 0.56-0.80) at 24 hours; the probability that diltiazem would achieve VRR control was 0.94 (95% CI 0.82-0.99) at 1 hour and 0.83 (95% CI 0.68-0.94) at 24 hours; and the probability of no serious adverse drug reaction would be 0.90 (95% CI 0.80-0.96) for digoxin and 0.96 (95% CI 0.86-0.98) for diltiazem.
Diltiazem was superior to digoxin with respect to the composite end point score at 1 hour (91.20 vs 17.29) and 24 hours (81.65 vs 66.43). Digoxin was superior to diltiazem at 24 hours only if the VRR was assumed to be at the highest 95% CI limit for digoxin and simultaneously at the lowest 95% CI for diltiazem (74.62 vs 68.63).
Clinical decision analysis suggests that intravenous diltiazem is superior to intravenous digoxin in controlling VRR in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter.
Although drug-induced allergic nephritis (DIAN) is one of the most common problems seen by nephrologists, its true frequency is probably underestimated. Diagnosis is often difficult and is typically only made in patients without another explanation for deteriorating renal function, and is often based solely on improvement after drug withdrawal. The diagnosis may be made more difficult due to lack of typical allergic symptoms, presence of other drugs, or confounding factors and equivocal noninvasive laboratory studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is renal biopsy, but it is only rarely performed during the acute phase of the reaction and is not without risk. It is important to keep a high index of suspicion with regard to DIAN since it is usually rapidly reversible. Failure to recognize it and discontinue the offending agents may result in unnecessary morbidity and occasionally, irreversible renal failure. In our patient, DIAN possibly was related to cefuroxime, but the patient did not experience associated allergic symptoms. The diagnosis was supported by the temporal course of renal deterioration during exposure to cefuroxime and improvement on its discontinuation; the pattern repeated with rechallenge. This is the first reported case of suspected DIAN due to cefuroxime.
The nature of hemolytic effect induced by ethylene glycol alkyl ethers was analyzed taking into account G-6-PDH activity, ATP, pyruvate and thiols levels in peripheral blood of rats treated with single doses of 2-ethoxyethanol and 2-butoxyethanol. In addition, the susceptibility to autoxidation of rat erythrocyte lipids was evaluated. A decrease of ATP level in a dose-dependent manner and an increase in protein- and nonprotein-bound sulfhydryl groups were observed. These results indicate that an acute hemolytic effect of ethylene glycol alkyl ethers is not associated with alterations in G-6-PDH activity and the susceptibility of erythrocyte lipids to autoxidation. Increases in protein- and nonprotein-bound sulfhydryl groups seem to indicate the selective hemolysis of the aged erythrocytes. The increase in pyruvate and thiol levels may protect erythrocytes against the appearance of oxidative stress.
o-Benzyl-p-chlorophenol was evaluated for its potential as a sensitizing agent for allergic contact hypersensitivity in mice. Female B6C3F1 mice were sensitized with 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0% o-benzyl-p-chlorophenol and challenged with 20.0% o-benzyl-p-chlorophenol. Doses of o-benzyl-p-chlorophenol were selected from assays for primary irritancy. Mice received 20 microliters by direct dermal application, for 5 days, to sites prepared by shaving, dermabrading and, in some mice, with intra dermal injection of Freund's complete adjuvant. The rest period was 7 days. Measurement of the contact hypersensitivity response in mice was by radioisotopic assay two days after challenge and mouse ear swelling test one and two days after challenge. Mice demonstrated statistically significant dose-dependent contact hypersensitivity response to o-benzyl-p-chlorophenol with or without adjuvant pretreatment.
5-Aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS-1) is the first rate controlling enzyme that controls cellular heme biosynthesis. Negative feedback regulation of ALAS-1 by the end product heme is well documented and provides the foundation for heme treatment of acute porphyrias, a group of diseases caused by genetic defects in the heme biosynthesis pathway and exacerbated by controlled up-regulation of ALAS-1. Heme is known to affect ALAS-1 activity by repressing gene transcription, accelerating mRNA degradation, and impeding pre-ALAS-1 mitochondrial translocation. In the current study, we examined the effect of heme on the rate of mature ALAS-1 protein turnover in human cells and tissues and explored the mediator involved in this new regulatory mechanism. We found that heme and other metalloporphyrins such as CoPP and CrPP decreased mitochondrial ALAS-1 protein through proteolysis. This degradative effect cannot be emulated by iron or free protoporphyrin, two major chemical components of the heme ring, and is independent of oxidative stress. Down-regulating the activity of mitochondrial LONP1, an ATP-dependent protease that controls the selective turnover of mitochondrial matrix proteins, with potent inhibitors and specific siRNA diminished the negative effect of heme on mitochondrial ALAS-1. Therefore, our data support the existence of a conserved heme feedback regulatory mechanism that functions on the mature form of ALAS-1 protein through the activity of a mitochondrial proteolytic system.
A 45-year-old woman was administered oral and intravenous diphenhydramine 25 mg for the treatment of an allergic reaction. Within 2 minutes she rapidly developed trismus, dysarthria, tremors of the upper extremities, left-sided weakness, and diminished consciousness. She was treated with intravenous diazepam and benztropine with good response. After approximately 12 hours the patient's condition was completely resolved except for minor subjective weakness of her left extremities. Her hospital stay was uneventful, and she was discharged after 4 days after refusing rechallenge with the drug. Several cases of acute dystonic reactions secondary to antihistamines have been reported in the literature, four of which involved diphenhydramine. Such reactions may occur after short- or long-term therapy. Most patients experienced rapidly developing trismus, facial dystonia, dysarthria, and occasionally, decreases in consciousness, motor incoordination, and weakness. Because of the widespread availability of diphenhydramine and other antihistamines to the general public, awareness of this effect is of great importance.
We examined the relationship between the expression of retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha) and upregulation of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in the retinoid-induced inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation. HCC cell lines showed a marked expression of RAR-alpha, whereas the expression levels of RAR-beta and RAR-gamma were relatively lower. An RAR-alpha agonist significantly inhibited the HCC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. The RAR-alpha expression closely related to the upregulation of IGFBP-3 as compared with RAR-beta or RAR-alpha expressions. RAR-alpha agonist would be beneficial to inhibit the growth of HCC.
Mutations in the homeobox gene PITX2 are responsible for a range of clinical phenotypes involving ocular and craniofacial development. Several mutations within the Pitx2 homeodomain region are specifically responsible for the development of the related autosomal-dominant disorders Rieger syndrome and iridogoniodysgenesis. To address the question of the structural effect of disease-causing mutations on the Pitx2 homeodomain, we used threading techniques to examine the tertiary structure of the Pitx2 wild-type and mutant homeodomain, using the crystal structure of Drosophila engrailed homeodomain bound with DNA as a template [Kissinger et al., 1990]. The threading analysis reveals that the wild-type Pitx2 homeodomain is indeed capable of forming the typical three-helical bundle-fold characteristic of homeodomain proteins. Energy calculations indicate that the homeodomain structure is stabilized primarily by hydrophobic interactions between residues at the helical interface. Point mutations responsible for the development of these genetic disorders were also examined; the results suggest that these mutations lead to the inability of Pitx2 to adopt its proper structure and bind to the regulatory sequences of its target gene(s), which in turn affects its metabolic role in the cell.

A 31-year-old female developed multiple episodes of grand mal seizures after combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine and bleomycin for germ cell ovarian cancer stage Ic. The clinicoradiologic features in this patient were consistent with posterior leukoencephalopathy, which is a rare complication of chemotherapy. Seizures were controlled by the anticonvulsive agent Dilantin (Pfizer, Khet Klongtoey, Bangkok) and she returned home without any permanent neurologic deficits. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 2 weeks later showed complete resolution of the abnormalities. This syndrome has been previously reported following cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Physicians should remain alert to the potential hazards of chemotherapy to the central nervous system. Risks and benefits should be seriously considered before starting treatment.
Through 30 years of widespread use, acetaminophen has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages. The potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular toxicities is very low. However, acetaminophen has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of anaphylaxis, including hypotension, in sensitive individuals. This article describes two critically ill patients in whom transient episodes of hypotension reproducibly developed after administration of acetaminophen. Other symptoms of allergic reactions were not clinically detectable. The hypotensive episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration. The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider acetaminophen in patients with hypotension of unknown origin.
Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was given to 12 patients with renovascular hypertension: To five of them as a single drug after discontinuing other medications, and to seven patients as a substitute for one of their previous medications. The drug proved effective in controlling hypertension in all patients. Flushing and palpitations occurred in two of them, one of whom also showed a rise in creatinine and mild hyperkalemia. Two patients who had developed side effects while on captopril (renal deterioration in one, and severe rash in the other) tolerated enalapril well. Enalapril effectively reduced the blood pressure in the one patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis without causing renal failure.
Numerous in vitro studies have found that clot formation may occur when blood is mixed directly with nonionic low-osmolality contrast media during angiographic procedures because of activation of hemostasis in the catheter; ionic contrast media, on the other hand, inhibit clot formation. Thirty patients were injected with low-osmolality contrast media--15 with ioxaglate, an ionic dimer, and 15 with iopamidol, a nonionic monomer. The inner wall of the angiographic catheter was studied with electron microscopy after selective catheterization of supraaortic vessels. Clot formation of various extent was observed in nine (60%) of the patients administered iopamidol. No coagulation process was found in the catheters of the patients administered ioxaglate. Results indicate that nonionic, low-osmolality contrast media may play a role in the formation of thromboembolisms.
Warfarin-associated fetal hemorrhage is a fatal event. We report the case of a 39-year-old woman who had been taking warfarin for 23 years since undergoing mitral valve replacement. Thereafter, when she was found to be pregnant, the medication was switched to heparin from 6 to 21 weeks of gestation. Following this, she was prescribed oral warfarin again (3.5 mg per day), with a strict control of prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR). At 23 weeks of gestation, fetal intracranial hemorrhage occurred because of maternal exposure to warfarin. Maternal PT/INR does not correlate well with the activity of warfarin in the fetus and currently, there is no direct way to prevent fetal intracranial hemorrhage. Hence, further research on the optimal coagulation therapy in pregnant women with valve replacement should be encouraged.
We are reporting a case of a 69 years old man developed acute renal failure due to interstitial nephritis during treatment with the drug clozapine, and that improve after to discontinuation of this drug. The clozapine is a new antipsychotic drug that may produce severes adverses reactions, like medullary toxicity. Recently 10 cases of clozapine-induced AIN have been reported. We want to associate to the cases publicated with a new case because it is a severe adverse reaction.
We previously demonstrated a good correlation between the increased relative liver weight caused by DDT and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of DDT or the total DDT (T-DDT) in plasma and liver of rats in a 7-day repeated dose study at 1000 ppm. To confirm the reliability of AUC for predicting toxic responses at different dose levels, we conducted a further 28-day repeated dose study of p,p'-DDT in male F344 rats at dietary levels of 50, 160, and 500 ppm. Concentrations of DDT and its metabolites in plasma, brain, liver, and fat for each dose group were measured at various time intervals during the study. The concentrations of DDT and T-DDT in plasma and liver were compared with their AUCs in relation to hepatotoxic responses including increased relative liver weight, microsomal enzyme induction (CYP2B1), and inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication. The coefficient (R(2)) values of each toxic response in correlation with AUCs were generally much higher than those with concentrations at any dose levels, although the R(2) values vary considerably among toxic parameters. These results have confirmed that the AUC of DDT or T-DDT in plasma or liver is a reliable marker for predicting hepatotoxicity caused by DDT in repeated dose studies.
Two elderly patients with mineralocorticoid excess state due to 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11beta-HSD2) impairment are described. Moreover, the role of the precursor-product ratios of the steroids reflecting 11beta-HSD2 activity was estimated in 5 patients, including 3 patients reported previously by us. Significant elevations of urinary cortisol/cortisone ratios were observed, whereas urinary tetrahydrocortisol (THF)+allo-THF/tetrahydrocortisone (THE) ratios were not elevated significantly. Furthermore, an even more distinct elevation of serum cortisol/cortisone ratio was evident in all instances of 5 patients, suggesting a significant clinical role of the serum cortisol/cortisone ratio in the diagnosis of 11beta-HSD2 impairment.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is treated frequently with stimulants in both children and adults. While tics are occasional complications of stimulant therapy, chorea is reported rarely. We describe an adult ADHD patient who developed chorea upon dose escalation of mixed amphetamine salts, which resolved on discontinuation of the drug.
We report a recurrent 680-kb deletion within chromosome 15q13.3 in ten individuals, from four unrelated families, with neurodevelopmental phenotypes including developmental delay, mental retardation and seizures. This deletion likely resulted from nonallelic homologous recombination between low-copy repeats on the normal and inverted region of chromosome 15q13.3. Although this deletion also affects OTUD7A, accumulated data suggest that haploinsufficiency of CHRNA7 is causative for the majority of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome.
In the present study, chronic treatment of atorvastatin was evaluated on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 +/- 25 g) were randomized into the following four groups: (1) control group, (2) isoproterenol-treated group, (3) atorvastatin-treated group, and (4) isoproterenol- and atorvastatin-treated group. Various serum and tissue parameters as well as histopathological studies were carried out in all groups. Isoproterenol administration produced severe myocardial damage and oxidative stress in rats. Atorvastatin treatment reduced myocardial infarction which has been reflected by improvement in serum parameters, ATPase activities and histopathological lesions. However, it could not reduce oxidative stress and hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol. Hence, it can be concluded that atorvastatin may protect myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol independent of its antioxidant properties.
Certain waterblooms of toxic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are a health threat because of their production of toxic peptides, termed microcystins, which cause liver damage in wild and domesticated animals. The most widely studied microcystin is microcystin-LR, a heptapeptide containing the two L-amino acids, leucine and arginine. The inhibition of protein phosphatase type 1 and type 2A activities by microcystin-LR is similar to that of the known protein phosphatase inhibitor and tumor promoter okadaic acid. We show in this report that microcystin-LR, applied below the acute toxicity level, dose-dependently increases the number and percentage area of positive foci for the placental form of glutathione S-transferase in rat liver, which was initiated with diethylnitrosamine. The result was obtained independently through two animal experiments. This observation indicates that microcystin-LR is a new liver tumor promoter mediated through inhibition of protein phosphatase type 1 and type 2A activities. This provides further evidence that the okadaic acid pathway is a general mechanism of tumor promotion in various organs, such as mouse skin, rat glandular stomach and rat liver.
Side effects associated with administration of repetitive intravenous dihydroergotamine (DHE) were prospectively studied in 72 patients with chronic daily headache who were hospitalized in a dedicated inpatient headache treatment program. All patients received 11 consecutive doses of DHE, starting with 0.25 mg and increasing by 0.25 mg up to a maximum dose of 1.25 mg, depending on side effects and/or headache relief. The adverse events were recorded after each dose administered. The great majority of patients (91.6%) reported at least one side effect. The most common were: nausea (72.2%), increase in previous headache (47.2%), lightheadedness (33.3%), "new" headache (27.8%), and leg cramps (23.6%). The overall number of side effect complaints did not increase proportionally with the strength of the dose of DHE administered. These complaints declined from the earlier to the later doses of DHE, except for leg cramps, which were more common with the later doses. Side effects determined the strength of subsequent doses of DHE in only 18.1% of patients. Only four patients had to have a decrease in dosage and none required termination of DHE due to side effects. Although repetitive intravenous DHE causes frequent side effects, they are usually mild and transient and decrease with subsequent doses, even at higher doses.
Sumatriptan, a 5-hydroxytryptamine1, (5-HT1) receptor agonist is an effective abortive agent for migraine headaches. A common side effect in 3% to 7.9% of patients is chest pain. Although most cases of chest pain are not thought to be of cardiac origin, its mechanism is not entirely understood. Rare examples of electrocardiogram changes consistent with transient ischemia have been reported. Isolated instances of angina, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and death have been temporally associated with sumatriptan administration. In most cases, it is unclear whether underlying cardiovascular disease existed or contributed to this adverse event. We report the history of a 56-year-old female patient with migraine who experienced a myocardial infarction shortly after using sumatriptan, despite having had a normal cardiovascular evaluation. As she had a normal cardiac catheterization after the event, we find it probable that sumatriptan induced coronary vasospasm and myocardial infarction.
Drug-induced cholestasis is a frequently observed side effect of drugs and is often caused by an unexpected interaction with the bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11). BSEP is the key membrane transporter responsible for the transport of bile acids from hepatocytes into bile. Here, we developed a pharmacophore model that describes the molecular features of compounds associated with BSEP inhibitory activity. To generate input and validation data sets, in vitro experiments with membrane vesicles overexpressing human BSEP were used to assess the effect of compounds (50 μM) on BSEP-mediated (3)H-taurocholic acid transport. The model contains two hydrogen bond acceptor/anionic features, two hydrogen bond acceptor vector features, four hydrophobic/aromatic features, and exclusion volumes. The pharmacophore was validated against a set of 59 compounds, including registered drugs. The model recognized 9 out of 12 inhibitors (75%), which could not be identified based on general parameters, such as molecular weight or SlogP, alone. Finally, the model was used to screen a virtual compound database. A number of compounds found via virtual screening were tested and displayed statistically significant BSEP inhibition, ranging from 13 ± 1% to 67 ± 7% of control (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we developed and validated a pharmacophore model that describes molecular features found in BSEP inhibitors. The model may be used as an in silico screening tool to identify potentially harmful drug candidates at an early stage in drug development.
Gene-environment associations are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility, with an association existing between smoking, HLA- DRB1 'shared epitope' alleles, PTPN22 and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP). Here, we test the hypothesis that a subset of the anti-CCP response, with specific autoimmunity to citrullinated alpha-enolase, accounts for an important portion of these associations. In 1,497 individuals from three RA cohorts, antibodies to the immunodominant citrullinated alpha-enolase CEP-1 epitope were detected in 43-63% of the anti-CCP-positive individuals, and this subset was preferentially linked to HLA-DRB1*04. In a case-control analysis of 1,000 affected individuals and 872 controls, the combined effect of shared epitope, PTPN22 and smoking showed the strongest association with the anti-CEP-1-positive subset (odds ratio (OR) of 37, compared to an OR of 2 for the corresponding anti-CEP-1-negative, anti-CCP-positive subset). We conclude that citrullinated alpha-enolase is a specific citrullinated autoantigen that links smoking to genetic risk factors in the development of RA.
Compartment syndrome can be a complication of warfarin treatment after a minor trauma. We report a case of an elderly woman who had an uncontrolled, high Internationalised Normalized Ratio (INR) level and had incurred a large haematoma on the left upper arm after a fall. After two days, the patient developed a massive oedema and clinical compartment syndrome. It is essential to be aware of symptoms and signs of compartment ischaemia, as early fasciotomy can prevent late complications such as muscle necrosis and contracture or at worst amputation. The patient should be hospitalized for observation for compartment syndrome and control of the INR level.
