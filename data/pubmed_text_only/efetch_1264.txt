Hyperinsulinism of infancy is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion resulting in severe hypoglycemia. To date, mutations in five different genes, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, ABCC8), the inward rectifying potassium channel (K(IR)6.2, KCNJ11), glucokinase (GCK), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1), and short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (SCHAD), have been implicated. Previous reports suggest that, in 40% of patients, no mutation can be identified in any of these genes, suggesting additional locus heterogeneity. However, previous studies did not screen all five genes using direct sequencing, the most sensitive technique available for mutation detection. We selected 15 hyperinsulinism of infancy patients and systematically sequenced the promoter and all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries of ABCC8 and KCNJ11. If no mutation was identified, the coding sequence and intron/exon boundaries of GCK, GLUD1, and SCHAD were sequenced. Seven novel mutations were found in the ABCC8 coding region, one mutation was found in the KCNJ11 coding region, and one novel mutation was found in each of the two promoter regions screened. Functional studies on beta-cells from six patients showed abnormal ATP-sensitive K+ channel function in five of the patients; the sixth had normal channel activity, and no mutations were found. Photolabeling studies using a reconstituted system showed that all missense mutations altered intracellular trafficking. Each of the promoter mutations decreased expression of a reporter gene by about 60% in a heterologous expression system. In four patients (27%), no mutations were identified. Thus, further genetic heterogeneity is suggested in this disorder. These patients represent a cohort that can be used for searching for mutations in other candidate genes.
Prolonged exposure to environmentally relevant amounts of CdCl2 results in cadmium accumulation in dopamine-rich brain regions, such as striatum. Exposure to these low levels of cadmium also diminishes cocaine-induced hyperactivity and conditioned reinforcement. The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of cadmium on amphetamine pharmacology. Direct application of cadmium (0.1-100 microM), within the concentrations reported in brain after chronic exposure, to preloaded rat striatal slices did not alter D-amphetamine-evoked [3H]dopamine release. To determine the effect of dietary cadmium exposure on amphetamines, rats received ad libitum access to diet containing CdCl2 (10 or 100 ppm) or to control diet for 30 days and then D-amphetamine-evoked [3H]dopamine release and methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity were measured. Dietary CdCl2 exposure produced a marked increase in cadmium blood and brain levels, approximate to environmental metal exposure. Dietary cadmium exposure was associated with decreased potency of D-amphetamine to evoke [3H]dopamine release. Cadmium-exposed rats were also less sensitive to the locomotor-activating effect of acute methamphetamine (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) injection. The present findings demonstrate that the presence of cadmium in brain is not sufficient for the inhibition of D-amphetamine-evoked dopamine release. This suggests that cadmium does not directly interfere with the mechanism of action for amphetamine pharmacology; rather, it suggests that long-term cadmium exposure induces a change in the number and/or function of striatal neurons.
The purpose of this study is to determine the characteristic clinical features, radiologic findings, and precipitating and prognostic factors in the patients with breast cancer and with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced leukoencephalopathy. We reviewed the medical records of six breast cancer patients who developed leukoencephalopathy after chemotherapy which included 5-FU and also evaluated thorough neurological examinations including mini-mental status examination, cerebrospinal fluid studies, brain images and brain biopsies. Six patients exhibited slowly progressing neurologic symptoms characterized by the impairment of cognitive function, abulia, ataxic gait, and/or akinetic mutism. None of the patients had any specific causes or etiologic factors for leukoencephalopathy. Brain MRI in all patients showed diffuse periventricular white matter changes in the T2-weighted MR image. Brain biopsy in Patient 1 showed fragmented axonal fiber and minimally deprived myelination with many scattered macrophages. Five patients who treated with steroids at the onset of neurological symptoms showed clinical improvement, regardless of their age, sex, the pathology and stage of breast cancer, or the total dosage of chemotherapeutic agents. We conclude that leukoencephalopathy in these cases could be attributable to 5-FU neurotoxicity and suggest that the administration of steroids might be the treatment of choice.
Tacrine, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor that has been used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, increases available acetylcholine (Ach) levels in the synaptic cleft thereby enhancing the activity of cholinergic pathways. However, excessive stimulation of nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction results in muscle deterioration. We tested whether reversible AChE inhibitors such as tacrine may induce similar effects. In the present study, tacrine administration (7.5 mg/kg twice daily) to rats produces a 20 and 30-fold increase in the number of degenerating cells in leg and diaphragm muscle, respectively, as compared to control. This myopathy is significantly decreased by co-administration of tacrine with the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME. These results show that tacrine can induce myopathy which may be mediated by increased NO production.
This phase II trial was planned to study the efficacy and toxicity of a fixed dose of cisplatin plus paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given over 1 hour with intrapatient dose escalation. Patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages IIB-IV); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status < or = 2; normal renal, liver, and bone marrow function; and evaluable residual disease after debulking surgery were accrued. Paclitaxel was given over 1-hour infusion and dose was escalated from 175 to 200 and 225 mg/m2 if nadir neutrophil counts were > or = 1000/microL, platelets were > or = 100,000/microL, and neurotoxicity was less than grade 2. Cisplatin was given after paclitaxel at a fixed dose of 80 mg/m2. Six courses at 3-week intervals were planned. From May 1995 to August 1996, 68 patients were entered. Paclitaxel could not be escalated in six patients, another six received up to 200 mg/m2, and 45 received 225 mg/m2. Three hundred seventy-five courses were given: 27.7% at 175 mg/m2, 19.2% at 200 mg/m2, and 53.1% at 225 mg/m2. All patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 67 were evaluable for response. Thirty-five patients had a complete clinical response (51.4%), 20 had a partial response (29.4%), six had stable disease (8.9%), and six progressed on therapy (8.9%). Overall response rate was 80.8 (95% confidence interval, 71.3% to 90.1%). Second-look laparotomy was performed in 32 patients, and 20 of them (62.5%) had a pathologic complete remission. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was seen in 26 patients (38%), but only one had fever. Severe thrombocytopenia was not seen. Peripheral neurotoxicity (grade 1, 39.7%; grade 2, 42.6%; and grade 3, 8.8%) was dose-limiting. It is too early to report on time to progression and survival, and these data are not yet available. This combination of cisplatin with escalating doses of paclitaxel is feasible and very active, but the high incidence of peripheral neurotoxicity may limit its use.
Previous research suggests that cocaine dysregulates dopamine D3 receptors. The present study examined the time course of changes in dopamine D3 receptor binding after terminating a cocaine self-administration regimen. [125I]-7-hydroxy-2-[N-propyl-N-(3'-iodo-2'-propenyl)-amino]-tetralin was used to label dopamine D3 receptors in rats that had undergone testing for cocaine-seeking behavior reinstated by a cocaine priming injection (15 mg/kg, i.p.; the behavior results have been previously published), and were killed 24 h after the test at time points that were either 2, 8, or 31-32 days after their last cocaine self-administration session. The results indicated a time-dependent increase in D3 receptor binding relative to controls that received saline yoked to the delivery of cocaine in an experimental animal. Specifically, there was no significant change in D3 receptor binding in cocaine-experienced rats killed at the 2- or 8-day time points relative to controls, but there was an increase in D3 receptor binding in the nucleus accumbens core and ventral caudate-putamen in rats killed at the 31- to 32-day time point. In a subsequent experiment, we replicated the increase in D3 receptor binding in rats that underwent a less extensive self-administration regimen, then were tested for cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, and then were killed 24 h later at a time point of 22 days after their last self-administration session. Furthermore, the increase in binding was attenuated by repeated 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin administration (1 mg/kg/day, s.c. for 14 days), a regimen that also reduces cocaine-seeking behavior in animals when tested in a nondrug state. Collectively, the findings suggest that regulatory responses of D3 receptors may be functionally related to changes in propensity for cocaine-seeking behavior.
Since publication of the results of the Gynecologic Oncology Group III study, the combination of cisplatin/paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has been widely adopted as standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. Further attempts to optimize first-line chemotherapy with platinum and taxanes include the substitution of cisplatin with carboplatin, individualization of the carboplatin dose by calculating it according to the area under the concentration-time curve, and reduction of paclitaxel infusion duration. These attempts have led to the initiation of several phase I/II trials evaluating the combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel. The promising results of these small studies have prompted the initiation of three phase III trials comparing carboplatin/paclitaxel with the standard combination of cisplatin/paclitaxel. The interim analysis after 15 months' accrual of the prospectively randomized German Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie (AGO) study is presented here. As of January 1997, 518 of 660 planned patients have been recruited. The interim analysis is based on data from 449 evaluable patients. The preliminary data indicate that hematologic toxicity occurred more frequently in arm A (carboplatin/paclitaxel), whereas nonhematologic toxicity occurred slightly more frequently in arm B (cisplatin/paclitaxel). Dose-intensity analysis did not reveal cumulative dose reductions or an increased need for colony-stimulating factors over subsequent courses in both arms. Forty-four patients with measurable disease following surgery completed chemotherapy and were evaluable for response, which remains blinded at this time and is reported for the group as a whole. So far, there have been 18 complete responses (41%) and 15 partial responses (34%), for an overall response rate of 75%. Retrospective comparison reveals no significant difference in response rates between patients in the cisplatin/paclitaxel arm of Gynecologic Oncology Group III and those in the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie study. Overall, this interim analysis did not reveal any reason for an early termination of this study. Accrual is ongoing and is expected to be completed this year.
Tamoxifen has been widely used for treatment, and more recently, for the prevention of breast cancer. Since breast carcinomas are composed of heterogeneous populations of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cells, we hypothesized that tamoxifen may suppress tumor growth by differentially affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. ER+ mammary tumors were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and when they became palpable, the animals were treated for 5, 10, or 20 days with tamoxifen, 1.0 mg/kg body weight. Tamoxifen induced a time-dependent decrease in proliferating (BrdU-labeled) cells, arrested the cells in G1/0 phase, and differentially decreased the cyclin E and cyclin D1 expression at mRNA and protein levels. In the same tumors, apoptotic cells increased during the first 10 days of treatment, but their number remained unchanged with extension of the treatment to 20 days. Thus, we provide data that tamoxifen may differentially affect cell proliferation and apoptosis in mammary tumors and that the expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E might also be considered potential intermediate biomarkers of response of mammary tumors to tamoxifen and possibly to other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).
Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; Princeton, NJ) is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits microtubular function and has shown efficacy in several solid tumors, mainly ovarian tumors, in which 20% to 40% response rates in previously treated patients were observed. We conducted a study to assess survival, response rate, and toxicity associated with paclitaxel treatment in patients with advanced ovarian cancer resistant to platinum therapy. Between September 1994 and November 1996, 38 patients were admitted for study and 37 were evaluable. All had disease progression or relapse within 1 year of receiving platinum-containing first-line chemotherapy. Mean age was 59 years (range, 30 to 75 years), all had bulky disease, and 18 showed increased carbohydrate antigen-125 at admission. They were treated every 3 weeks with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion, preceded by standard premedication. Response rate was 51.3%, with a median response duration of 10.0 months and a median survival rate of 16.8 months. Mild to moderate hematologic toxicity was observed with only one episode of grade 4 neutropenia, without fever. Gastrointestinal toxicity was moderate and peripheral neuropathy was mild, except for two patients who had concomitant pathologies or previous treatment, which might have caused some neuropathy. We concluded that paclitaxel given as a 3-hour infusion was easily administered for ambulatory treatment, with mild to moderate toxicity and promising results based on rate and duration of response as well as survival.
Advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urothelial tract is usually fatal despite high response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated marked single-agent activity in TCC, and combinations of carboplatin and paclitaxel have been well tolerated in other solid tumors. Methotrexate is also active in TCC. Due to unexpectedly severe myelosuppression and mucositis when methotrexate and paclitaxel were combined, we undertook a phase I trial of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and escalating doses of methotrexate with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and leucovorin support in advanced TCC to determine the feasibility of this combination. Nineteen previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic TCC were eligible. Median age was 62 years. In sequence, paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 (3-hour infusion), carboplatin dosed to an area under the concentration-time curve of 6 mg/mL x min, and methotrexate 10 mg/m2, increasing in 10-mg/m2 increments, were administered on day 1 every 21 days. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 300 microg/d or 480 microg/d (in patients <60 kg or >60 kg, respectively) was administered on days 2 through 11 and leucovorin 15 mg orally every 6 hours for 3 days. At this time, the methotrexate dose has been escalated to 50 mg/m2. There were no dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1. Sixty-eight cycles have been administered (range, one to eight cycles; median, three cycles). Significant hematologic toxicity including neutropenic sepsis (two episodes) occurred in subsequent cycles, but was infrequent. The major nonhematologic toxicity was neuropathy. Sixteen patients are evaluable for response. One patient has achieved a complete response, seven are partial responders, seven have stable disease, and one progressed on therapy. The overall response rate is 50% (95% confidence interval, 25% to 75%). The combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and methotrexate holds promise to be well tolerated and active in advanced TCC.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combination of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) and carboplatin in patients with endometrial cancer known to be resistant to standard therapy. Subjects were taken from three groups: (1) recurrent or persistent disease following surgery and/or radiation, (2) advanced disease at diagnosis, and (3) high-risk histology. The combination of carboplatin (pharmacologically dosed at an area under the concentration-time curve of 5) and paclitaxel (135 to 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours) was given intravenously every 4 weeks for eight courses. Data about response, overall and progression-free survival, and toxicity were collected. Response and toxicity were evaluated by physical examinations, x-ray films, and blood tests. Twenty patients have participated to date, including eight considered evaluable for response. Due to limited follow-up, survival and progression-free intervals are not yet assessable. Of patients with measurable disease, five of eight (63%) have had significant reduction in the size of evaluable tumor masses, constituting a partial response. Although two patients had clinical and radiographic complete responses, occult disease was found at surgery. There were no complete responders. Fifteen patients had grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, but none had neutropenic fever or hospitalization for sepsis. One patient was taken off study for grade 3 neuropathy. There was one possible treatment-related death. In this preliminary report, this combination is active against tumors of the endometrium, with acceptable levels of toxicity. Further follow-up will be required to determine the duration of response and whether progression-free and overall survival are influenced by treatment with these drugs.
Three patients with inflammatory or immunologically mediated disease manifested striking behavioral abnormalities in association with long-term alternate-day prednisone regimens. Of particular note was the fact that differences in the abnormalities depended on the day that the patients received their drug: the symptoms that appeared on a treatment day were opposite those present on a day of no therapy. These symptoms were reminiscent of rapid mood cycling in some patients with manic-depressive affective disorder. The phenomenon was dose related and markedly diminished in two patients as the dosage of corticosteroid was decreased, despite the fact that the alternate-day regimen was continued.
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a natural vitamin A derivative that has a profound effect on the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and death.
To investigate the tissue dynamic and cellular invasion effects of ATRA in choriocarcinoma (CCA), an aggressive trophoblastic tumour, by using a three-dimensional organotypic culture model system and cell invasion assay, respectively.
An organotypic culture model of two CCA cell lines, JAR and JEG, was established. The effects of 1 microM ATRA on proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis on this CCA model were assessed by morphological assessment of the mitotic and apoptotic figures as well as by Ki-67 and caspase-related M30 cytoDeath antibody immunohistochemistry and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay. The effect of ATRA on p53 and its regulated protein product, WAF1/Cip1, was also evaluated with DO7 and p21(WAF1) antibodies, respectively. Moreover, the effect of ATRA on cellular (CCA) invasion was also investigated with Cell Invasion Kit on the JEG cell line.
ATRA was found to induce marked apoptosis in organotypic cultures of both cell lines, as evidenced by increased M30-positive cells (p<0.0001) and increased TUNEL-positive cells (p<0.0001) in treated cultures; to decrease proliferation, as evidenced by decreased Ki-67-positive cells (p<0.0001); and to decrease p53-DO7 immunoreactivity (p<0.0001) and increase p21(WAF1) (p<0.0001) immunoreactivity. 1.5 microM ATRA was found to effectively inhibit JEG cell invasion in the cell invasion assay.
ATRA treatment was found to inhibit invasion and proliferation and enhance apoptosis, probably by the activation of caspases and induction of differentiation. ATRA and synthetic retinoids may be alternative agents for the treatment of CCA.
The potential for chemical weapons to be used in terrorism is a real possibility. Classes of chemical weapons include nerve agents, vesicants (blister agents), choking agents, incapacitating agents, riot control agents, blood agents, and toxic industrial chemicals. The nerve agents work by blocking the actions of acetylcholinesterase leading to a cholinergic syndrome. Nerve agents include sarin, tabun, VX, cyclosarin, and soman. The vesicants include sulfur mustard and lewisite. The vesicants produce blisters and also damage the upper airways. Choking agents include phosgene and chlorine gas. Choking agents cause pulmonary edema. Incapacitating agents include fentanyl and its derivatives and adamsite. Riot control agents include Mace and pepper spray. Blood agents include cyanide. The mechanism of toxicity for cyanide is blocking oxidative phosphorylation. Toxic industrial chemicals include agents such as formaldehyde, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia.
Although doxorubicin [adriamycin (ADM)] ototoxicity has not been detected to date, it has been reported that neurotoxicity in the central nervous system was induced by chemotherapy with ADM in patients receiving chronic cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment. ADM ototoxicity may be induced by combination therapy with CsA because extrusion of ADM from the inner ear by p-glycoprotein (p-gp), which acts as an extrusion pump and is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells of capillary blood vessels, might be inhibited by CsA. resulting in significant accumulation of ADM in the inner ear. ADM (10 mg/kg) was administered to FVB mice either with or without CsA (200 mg/kg). Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded before and after treatment. ABR changes were not observed in mice treated with either ADM or CsA alone. Threshold elevation, elongation of wave I-V latencies and interpeak latencies of waves I-II, I-III, I-IV and I-V were detected in mice treated with ADM in combination with CsA. These changes reached their peak values 3 weeks after treatment, and then recovered to pre-treatment levels. In normal mice, ADM is extruded by p-gp from the inner ear and auditory pathway, thus preventing hearing disorder. However, ADM ototoxicity was induced by combination therapy with CsA, indicating that CsA has an inhibitory action on p-gp function in the auditory pathway, including the inner ear. After organ transplantation, therefore, clinical administration of ADM in combination with CsA should be performed with caution.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 years' treatment of moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with finasteride.
Double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre, prospective randomized study.
Outpatient care in 28 centres across Canada.
Men aged 45 to 80, in good health, with moderate BPH and no evidence of prostate cancer. A total of 613 men were entered into the study; 472 completed the 2 years of treatment.
After 1 month of receiving a placebo (run-in period), patients were given either finasteride (5 mg/d) or a placebo for 2 years.
