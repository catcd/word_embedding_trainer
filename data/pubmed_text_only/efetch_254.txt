Clonidine is believed to reduce blood pressure by a neural action and animal experiments suggest that this consists in potentiation of baroreflexes. In 16 patients with essential hypertension we studied the effects of alterations in carotid sinus baroreceptor activity (neck chamber technique) on arterial blood pressure (catheter measurements) and heart rate, before and after intravenous administration of 150 microgram and 300 microgram of clonidine. The magnitude of the reflex responses was assessed by the slope of the linear regressions relating applied increase and decrease in tissue pressure at the carotid sinus (and therefore applied decrease and increase in carotid sinus transmural pressure) and resulting changes in mean arterial pressure and R-R interval. Clonidine caused a marked reduction in mean arterial pressure (-26 +/- 3 mm Hg) and a slight but significant reduction in heart rate (-5 +/- 1 b/min). There was no evidence for a potentiation of the baroreceptor influence on blood pressure, although a slight potentiation of the baroreceptor influence on heart rate was observed in few instances. We conclude that in man clonidine can exert a pronounced hypotensive effect without potentiating baroreceptor influence on blood pressure. Therefore this mechanism does not play a prominent role in the clinical antihypertensive action of the drug.
Treatment of Parkinson disease commonly includes levodopa and dopamine agonists; however, the interaction of these 2 drugs is poorly understood.
To examine the effects of a dopamine agonist on the motor response to levodopa.
Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial.
Ambulatory academic referral center. Patients Thirteen patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease taking levodopa and experiencing motor fluctuations and dyskinesia.
Eligible individuals were randomly assigned to receive pramipexole dihydrochloride or placebo for 4 weeks followed by a 2-hour intravenous levodopa infusion on consecutive days at 2 rates and with blinded assessments. They were then crossed over to the alternate oral therapy for 4 weeks followed by levodopa infusion and reassessment.
Change in finger-tapping speed, measured using the area under the curve (AUC) for finger taps per minute across time; peak finger-tapping speed; duration of response; time to "ON" (defined as a 10% increase in finger-tapping speed above baseline); walking speed; and dyskinesia AUC.
Pramipexole with levodopa infusion increased finger-tapping speed beyond the change in baseline by a mean (SE) of 170 (47.2) per minute x minutes (P = .006) and more than doubled the AUC for finger-tapping speed. Pramipexole increased peak finger-tapping speed by a mean (SE) of 18 (8.5) taps per minute (P = .02) and improved mean (SE) walking speed (15.9 [0.70] vs 18.9 [0.70] seconds, P = .004). Pramipexole prolonged duration of response after levodopa infusion and shortened time to ON. Pramipexole increased mean (SE) baseline dyskinesia scores (26.0 [5.85] vs 12.1 [5.85] points, P = .05) and peak dyskinesia scores with levodopa infusion.
Pramipexole augmented the motor response to levodopa beyond a simple additive effect and increased the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. When considering a combination of these therapies, an appropriate balance should be maintained regarding gain of motor function vs worsening of dyskinesia.

COX-2 is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. The prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are involved in inflammation and pain response in different tissues in the body. Accumulating evidence from epidemiologic studies, chemical carcinogen-induced rodent models and clinical trials indicate that COX-2 plays a role in human carcinogenesis and is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue. We examined whether sequence variants in the COX-2 gene are associated with prostate cancer risk. We analyzed a large population-based case-control study, cancer prostate in Sweden (CAPS) consisting of 1,378 cases and 782 controls. We evaluated 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire COX-2 gene in 94 subjects of the control group. Five SNPs had a minor allele frequency of more than 5% in our study population and these were genotyped in all case patients and control subjects and gene-specific haplotypes were constructed. A statistically significant difference in allele frequency between cases and controls was observed for 2 of the SNPs (+3100 T/G and +8365 C/T), with an odds ratio of 0.78 (95% CI=0.64-0.96) and 0.65 (95% CI=0.45-0.94) respectively. In the haplotype analysis, 1 haplotype carrying the variant allele from both +3100 T/G and +8365 C/T, with a population frequency of 3%, was also significantly associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer (p=0.036, global simulated p-value=0.046). This study supports the hypothesis that inflammation is involved in prostate carcinogenesis and that sequence variation within the COX-2 gene influence the risk of prostate cancer.
The involvement of GABA-A receptors in the control of nociception was studied using the tail-flick test in rats. Non-hypnotic doses of the barbiturates phenobarbital (5-50 mg/kg), pentobarbital (17-33 mg/kg), and thiopental (7.5-30 mg/kg), of the benzodiazepine midazolam (10 mg/kg) or of ethanol (0.4-1.6 g/kg) administered by the systemic route reduced the latency for the tail-flick response, thus inducing a 'hyperalgesic' state in the animals. In contrast, non-convulsant doses of the GABA-A antagonist picrotoxin (0.12-1.0 mg/kg) administered systemically induced an increase in the latency for the tail-flick response, therefore characterizing an 'antinociceptive' state. Previous picrotoxin (0.12 mg/kg) treatment abolished the hyperalgesic state induced by effective doses of the barbiturates, midazolam or ethanol. Since phenobarbital, midazolam and ethanol reproduced the described hyperalgesic effect of GABA-A-specific agonists (muscimol, THIP), which is specifically antagonized by the GABA-A antagonist picrotoxin, our results suggest that GABA-A receptors are tonically involved in the modulation of nociception in the rat central nervous system.
Mitoxantrone hydrochloride (Novantrone) is an anthracenedione that has been used as one of the latest in a long line of general immunosuppresive agents studied in multiple sclerosis (MS). We reviewed the clinical, laboratory, neuroimaging and echocardiography data of 18 patients from February 2001 to March 2004 out of a total number of 100 patients with definite MS. Fourteen patients were women (77.7%) and four were men. The mean age of the patients was 41.6 +/- 10 years old (confidence intervals 95%: 36.4-46.7 years old). The mean duration of disease was 10.5 +/- 6.3 years. Fourteen patients had the secondarily progressive form of MS, and four had the relapsing-remitting form. Mitoxantrone is an useful and clinically effective drug in MS and its major limitation is the potencial cardiotoxicity due to cumulative dose (140 mg).
A quantitative, cytochemical assay for measuring lysosomal enzymes in the peripheral nerves of mice has been developed. That the time course of lysosomal enzyme changes after misonidazole (MISO) treatment reflects the degree of neurotoxicity of this agent in the mouse, has been confirmed by the use of two known neurotoxic compounds: methyl mercury and acrylamide. This effect is specific to the peripheral nerves and was not found in liver, kidney, heart or cerebral cortex. Enzyme activities varied with mouse strain and sex, as did the response to MISO treatment. Of the mice studied, female C57 gave the greatest increase in beta-glucuronidase activity. With the MISO dose of 0.6 mg/g/dose the increased enzyme activity was independent of the route of administration and appeared to approach a plateau after 5 daily doses.
Decreased dilation of cerebral arterioles via an increase in oxidative stress may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes-induced complications leading to cognitive dysfunction and/or stroke. Our goal was to determine whether resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound present in red wine, has a protective effect on cerebral arterioles during type 1 diabetes (T1D). We measured the responses of cerebral arterioles in untreated and resveratrol-treated (10 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) nondiabetic and diabetic rats to endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS) nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent agonists and to a NOS-independent agonist. In addition, we harvested brain tissue from nondiabetic and diabetic rats to measure levels of superoxide under basal conditions. Furthermore, we used Western blot analysis to determine the protein expression of eNOS, nNOS, SOD-1, and SOD-2 in cerebral arterioles and/or brain tissue from untreated and resveratrol-treated nondiabetic and diabetic rats. We found that T1D impaired eNOS- and nNOS-dependent reactivity of cerebral arterioles but did not alter NOS-independent vasodilation. While resveratrol did not alter responses in nondiabetic rats, resveratrol prevented T1D-induced impairment in eNOS- and nNOS-dependent vasodilation. In addition, superoxide levels were higher in brain tissue from diabetic rats and resveratrol reversed this increase. Furthermore, eNOS and nNOS protein were increased in diabetic rats and resveratrol produced a further increased eNOS and nNOS proteins. SOD-1 and SOD-2 proteins were not altered by T1D, but resveratrol treatment produced a decrease in SOD-2 protein. Our findings suggest that resveratrol restores vascular function and oxidative stress in T1D. We suggest that our findings may implicate an important therapeutic potential for resveratrol in treating T1D-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction.
The activation pathway of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), including HGF activator (HGFA) and HGFA inhibitor-1, 2 (HAI-1, 2), has recently been clarified. The present study examined mRNA expressions of HGF, HGFA and HAI-1 following partial hepatectomy in normal and cirrhotic rats.
Liver cirrhosis was induced by intraperitoneal injections of dimethylnitrosamine. Two weeks after, the cirrhotic and normal rats underwent 70% hepatectomy and the liver regeneration rate, DNA synthesis of hepatocytes, plasma HGF level, and mRNA expressions of HGF, HGFA, and HAI-1 in the liver, spleen, and lung were examined at different times.
Liver regeneration in the cirrhotic rats was deteriorated with a later peak of hepatocellular DNA synthesis. Hepatic HGF mRNA and splenic HAI-1 mRNA were upregulated and liver HGFA mRNA was downregulated in the cirrhotic rats.
Insufficient HGF activation both by a reduced expression of hepatic HGFA and an increased expression of splenic HAI-1 may be one of the reasons for the impaired liver regeneration in cirrhosis.
Familial hyperproinsulinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma levels of proinsulin-like material. In two previously described kindreds this has been shown to be due to a structural abnormality in the proinsulin molecule. We have identified a third family with hyperproinsulinemia in which there appeared to be a different defect. The propositus, a 12-year-old girl, had borderline glucose intolerance and markedly elevated immunoreactive-insulin levels on oral glucose-tolerance testing. Gel filtration of plasma revealed that 66 per cent of circulating insulin immunoreactivity was accounted for by the proinsulin-like components. Two of four siblings, the father, and the paternal grandfather also had elevated fasting insulin immunoreactivity in the presence of normal plasma glucose concentrations and elevated levels of proinsulin-like material. In vitro tryptic digestion of plasma proinsulin-like material from an affected family member revealed that proinsulin was converted to insulin in a manner indistinguishable from that in the control. Similarly, proinsulin and insulin exhibited normal activity in a radioreceptor assay. These findings suggest that the proinsulin molecule in this family was normal and that hyperproinsulinemia was due to a defect in the conversion of proinsulin to insulin.
In experimental animals, procainamide causes hypotension and reductions in efferent vasoconstrictor sympathetic outflow that may result from ganglionic blockade or central nervous system sympathetic inhibition. To test the hypothesis that procainamide decreases sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in humans, we recorded postganglionic SNA in seven normal subjects in the baseline state and during infusions of procainamide HCl at 50 mg/min (loading) and 8 mg/min (maintenance). At the end of the loading infusion, mean arterial pressure (MAP) had decreased from 88.5 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- SEM) to 81.5 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), central venous pressure from 6.7 +/- 0.7 to 5.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), forearm vascular resistance (FVR) from 28 +/- 4.8 to 22.3 +/- 5.1 resistance units (p less than 0.05), and SNA from 259 +/- 47 to 94 +/- 26 units/min (p less than 0.05). These changes persisted during the maintenance infusion. Increased levels of SNA, FVR, and MAP provoked by the cold pressor test were reduced significantly by intravenous procainamide. In eight other subjects, intravenous procainamide HCl (15 mg/kg at 50 mg/min) caused dose-dependent inhibition of SNA that reversed as blood concentrations fell during drug washout. To determine if procainamide causes direct vasodilation, in nine subjects, graded infusions were delivered into the brachial artery at doses that produced no systemic effect. Ipsilateral FVR tended to increase during local intra-arterial infusion of procainamide. These data show that intravenous procainamide causes hypotension, vasodilation, and sympathetic withdrawal. Vasodilation does not result from a direct vasorelaxant effect of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition affecting millions of people around the world and is defined as pain that follows a lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system. This type of pain is difficult to treat, but the novel compounds pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin (Neurontin) have proven clinical efficacy. Unlike traditional analgesics such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or narcotics, these agents have no frank antiinflammatory actions and no effect on physiological pain. Although extensive preclinical studies have led to a number of suggestions, until recently their mechanism of action has not been clearly defined. Here, we describe studies on the analgesic effects of pregabalin in a mutant mouse containing a single-point mutation within the gene encoding a specific auxiliary subunit protein (alpha2-delta-1) of voltage-dependent calcium channels. The mice demonstrate normal pain phenotypes and typical responses to other analgesic drugs. We show that the mutation leads to a significant reduction in the binding affinity of pregabalin in the brain and spinal cord and the loss of its analgesic efficacy. These studies show conclusively that the analgesic actions of pregabalin are mediated through the alpha2-delta-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and establish this subunit as a therapeutic target for pain control.
Pulmonary hypertension and transient graft dysfunction may complicate the postoperative course of patients undergoing lung transplantation. We report the acute effect of inhaled nitric oxide (80 ppm) on hemodynamics and gas exchange in 6 patients (median age, 14 years; range, 5 to 21 years) after lung transplantation as well as the effect of extended treatment over 40 to 69 hours in 2 patients. In 5 patients with pulmonary hypertension nitric oxide lowered mean pulmonary artery pressure (from 38.4 +/- 1.6 to 29.4 +/- 3.1 mm Hg; p < 0.05), pulmonary vascular resistance index (from 9.3 +/- 1.4 to 6.4 +/- 1.3 Um2; p < 0.05), and intrapulmonary shunt fraction (from 28.6% +/- 8.3% to 21.0% +/- 5.7%; p < 0.05). There was a 28.4% +/- 7.2% reduction in transpulmonary pressure gradient with only minor accompanying effects on the systemic circulation. Mean arterial pressure decreased only 2.7% +/- 5% (from 76.4 +/- 2.2 to 74 +/- 2.3 mm Hg; p = not significant), and systemic vascular resistance index by 4.2% +/- 9.7% (from 21.7 +/- 3.1 to 20.6 +/- 3.6 Um2; p = not significant). Cardiac index was unchanged (from 3.5 +/- 0.8 to 3.6 +/- 0.7 L.min-1.m-2; p = not significant). Nitric oxide caused a sustained improvement in oxygenation and pulmonary artery pressure during extended therapy at doses of 10 ppm. There were no major side effects. However, transient methemoglobinemia (9%) developed in 1 patient after 10 hours of nitric oxide treatment. Nitric oxide may be useful in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and the impaired gas exchange that occurs after lung transplantation.
Using microchemical methods for detection of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (S) and its metabolite--5'-hydroxyindolilacetic acid (5'-HIAA) as well as the activity of neuromediator-utilising enzymes--MAO A and B and enzymes of acetylcholine metabolism--cholinacetyltranspherase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), we revealed that synthetic GABA-derivative compound diagram (250 mg/kg during 10 days) normalized functioning of dopaminergic and acetylcholinergic systems in sensormotor cortex and caudate nucleus of Wistar rats with haloperidol-induced (0.5 mg/kg during 30 days) bradykinesia. Measured by quantitative interpherometric method, a specific response of functionally different sensomotor cortex (layers III and V) neurons and caudate nucleus by such characteristics as cytoplasm and nuclei sizes, protein content and concentration was found. Control for rat's behavior in open field revealed that diagram restored emotional activity disturbed by haloperidol injections and improved the indices of the animals searching activity.
Gentamicin and standard-dose ibuprofen were administered to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis who developed renal failure and severe vestibulotoxicity. A contributing factor was possible suboptimal intravascular volume status. Because of the potential severity of this drug interaction, hydration status and renal and vestibular functions should be closely monitored in patients receiving ibuprofen and intravenous aminoglycosides concomitantly.
SAP97 gene encodes the synaptic scaffolding PDZ proteins that interact with the L: -alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptors. Because the disturbed glutamate neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, we investigated association between the SAP97 gene and schizophrenia. We genotyped 23 SNPs capturing the known common haplotype variations of the gene in a sample comprising 229 schizophrenic patients and 214 matched controls. In a single marker analysis, ten SNPs displayed nominally significant (P < 0.05) association with schizophrenia, although the P values of these SNPs were non-significant after the Bonferroni correction. We also compared haplotype estimates based on case--control genotypes and observed significant association of eight-two- and three- SNP haplotypes with schizophrenia following permutation-based correction. Further examination of the above series of SNPs or haplotypes in each gender revealed significant associations between some of these SNPs or haplotypes and the disorder only in males. The present findings suggest that the SAP97 gene may be a susceptibility factor in male schizophrenics and that the modification of the glutamate receptors-SAP97 signaling pathway could be involved in the disease pathophysiology.
The evidence base for the pharmacological treatment of bipolar II disorder is limited. In bipolar disorder, there is evidence for glutathione depletion and increased oxidative stress, as well as dysregulation of glutamate; N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has effects on both of these systems. Add-on NAC has been shown to have a significant benefit on depressive symptoms in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. In this report, we explore the effects of this compound in a subset of patients with bipolar II disorder from that trial.
Individuals were randomized to NAC or placebo in addition to treatment as usual, in a double-blind fashion. Mood and functional outcomes were assessed up to 24 weeks of treatment.
Fourteen individuals were available for this report, seven in each group. Six people achieved full remission of both depressive and manic symptoms in the NAC group; this was true for only two people in the placebo group (χ(2)=4.67, p=0.031).
Subgroup analyses in a small subsample of patients. Not all participants had elevated depression scores at baseline.
Notwithstanding all the limitations that subgroup analysis of trials carry, this data could serve as a hypothesis-generating stimulus for further clinical trials of pharmacologic treatment for bipolar II depression.
In the present study, the effects of o,p'-DDD on plasma levels of pregnenolone, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, deoxycortisol, corticosterone, cortisol, androstenedione and testosterone were studied in 6 patients with adrenal carcinoma (3 with Cushing's syndrome, 2 with adrenogenital syndrome, one without clinical manifestation) and 6 with Cushing's disease. Plasma levels of these steroids were decreased in all of the patients with adrenal carcinoma. The decrement of progesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone was greater than that of pregnenolone and 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone. These results indicate that o,p'-DDD inhibits both cholesterol cleavage enzyme and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase coupled with delta 5 to 4 isomerase system. Plasma levels of pregnenolone and 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone showed a twofold increase on the 7th day after consecutive administrations of o,p'-DDD in patients with Cushing's disease. Plasma levels of cortisol were decreased to normal one month after continuous o,p'-DDD treatment. Urinary 17-OHCS and 17-KS have been decreased out of proportion to the decrease in plasma cortisol in the first week of o,p'-DDD treatment. Such a disparity suggests that o,p'-DDD might affect the extra-adrenal metabolism of cortisol. However, no evidence was found for the inhibition of hepatic C17-20lyase and glucuronyl transferase. Regression of pulmonary metastases was observed in one case with Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal carcinoma, suggesting that o,p'-DDD causes necrosis of the metastatic adrenal carcinoma. A remission of the disease was obtained in one patient with Cushing's disease after 6 months of continuous o,p'-DDD treatment. The usefulness of o,p'-DDD for the treatment of adrenal carcinoma with metastases and Cushing's disease was confirmed.
This is a case presentation of an accidental contaminated needle stick injury from a patient known to be infected with both Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis B. The patient was managed with prophylactic hepatitis B immune globulin, hepatitis B vaccination and the HIV retroviral drug zidovudine (AZT). At one year after treatment the patient was not infected with HIV or hepatitis B, and there was adequate immunity generated after vaccination for hepatitis B.
The present study evaluates some azetidin-2-ones derivatives for their central nervous system (CNS) modulating activities. The compounds were chosen from a series (5a-o) which were previously synthesized and evaluated for hypolipidemic and antihyperglycemic activity based on the predictions made by the computer software "Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS)".
The test compounds were predicted to have a variety of biological activities but those with the best potential for CNS modulating activity were selected for evaluation of a particular CNS activity as 5a for anti-anxiety, 5b, 5n and 5j for nootropic activity and compound 5c anti-catatonic and anti-dyskinetic activities. Test compound 5a was evaluated for anti-anxiety activity in mirrored chamber model and for pentobarbitone induced sleep potentiation in mice. Test compounds 5b, 5n and 5j were evaluated for nootropic activity in mice by examining the effect on transfer latency on elevated plus maze (EPM) in mice and compound 5c was tested for anti-catatonic activity in perphenazine-induced catatonia and anti-dyskinetic effects in reserpine induced orofacial dyskinesia in rats, respectively.
The test compound 5a showed significant anxiolytic activity in the mirror chamber paradigm and showed potentiation of the pentobarbitone-induced hypnosis, which was comparable to diazepam. The nootropic activity of compounds 5b, 5n and 5j were found to be significant in elevated and maze test. The test compound 5c significantly prevented the perphenazine-induced catalepsy in a dose dependent manner. Potentiation of anti-catatonic effect of sub-effective dose of L-dopa and reversal of sulpiride-induced catalepsy was also observed by compound 5c. It indicated that the test compound might be showing anticatatonic effect by dopaminergic stimulation probably through D2 dopaminergic receptors. Compound 5c significantly reduced the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and jaw tremors induced by reserpine. It further supports the dopaminergic agonism by the test compound as reserpine induces oral dyskinetic features by depleting catecholamine (dopamine and nor- epinephrine).
It was concluded that azetidinones possess considerable CNS activities and can be further explored to find additional CNS active compounds.
We report on a case of reversible Pisa syndrome developed after treatment with galantamine in a patient with Alzheimer's disease without previous exposure to neuroleptic or other cholinesterase inhibitors. Complete and persistent resolution of the syndrome was achieved several weeks after botulinum toxin type-A injection.
Thymoxamine and deacetylthymoxamine antagonized the hypertensive response of pithed rats to noradrenaline and clonidine, probably by inhibiting vascular post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. N-demethyl-deacetylthymoxamine was inactive. Clonidine-induced reduction of tachycardia caused by electrical stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in pithed rats was antagonized by phentolamine but not by prazosin, thymoxamine, deacetylthymoxamine or N-demetyldeacetylthymoxamine. This suggests that prazosin and thymoxamine and its derivatives predominantly blocked alpha 1-adrenoceptors. In pentobarbitone-anaesthetized normotensive rats, prazosin, thymoxamine and deacetylthymoxamine decreased the hypotensive effect of clonidine, but had no significant effect on clonidine-induced bradycardia. These substances antagonized clonidine-induced hypotension in rats by the probable mechanism of inhibiting central alpha 1-adrenoceptors whose characteristics are similar to peripheral receptors. These data suggest that clonidine produced a hypotensive action in pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats via alpha 1-adrenoceptors and produced bradycardia via alpha 2-adrenoceptors.
It was shown that creatinphosphokinase activity of blood serum might be used as a criterion for evaluating the level of sparsely distributed damage in myocardium as a result of adrenaline administration. The protective effect of vitamin E under adrenaline-induced myocarditis was studied. The best effect was obtained after triple intramuscular injection of vitamin E before administration of pathological agent. Intravenous injection of the preparation has no benefits over that of intramuscular way of administration. Preventive action of vitamin E shows functioning itself in an increase of the quantity and activity of ubiquinone--the component of electron transport chain in mitochondria.
Nephrosis induced in rats by puromycin aminonucleoside treatment (PAN) results in the apical displacement of the glomerular filtration slit membrane by newly formed, intercellular occluding-type junctions. Similar changes can also be induced by acute kidney perfusion with protamine sulfate (PS). We have investigated the molecular nature of these altered junctions using an antibody to ZO-1, a protein found exclusively in tight junctions. Immunoblotting demonstrates ZO-1, a 225-kd band, in glomerular extracts of normal, PAN-, and PS-treated rats. By immunofluorescence, ZO-1 was localized at the base of podocytes outlining the capillary loops of glomeruli from all three experimental groups. At the electron microscope level, using immunoperoxidase or immunogold labeling, ZO-1 was concentrated along the cytoplasmic surfaces of the slit diaphragms of normal rats. In PAN or PS rats, it was concentrated along both the newly formed occluding-type junctions and the remaining slit diaphragms. When podocalyxin (the major membrane sialoprotein of the podocyte) was similarly localized, it was found exclusively apical to the displaced slit membrane. Based on morphology and the presence of ZO-1, the altered junctions seen in PAN and PS rats appear to represent bona fide tight junctions. Their rapid (15-minute) induction in PS-treated rats suggests that on neutralization of the cell surface charge by polycation perfusion, discontinuous tight junctions form from a preexisting pool of junctional proteins. These findings raise the possibility that glomerular hydraulic conductivity may be regulated in part by regulating the relative patency and width of the filtration slits through focal tight junction assembly.
Both aspirin and phenacetin derivatives were shown to be nephrotoxic when administered to rats as a single intravenous injection. Phenacetin derivatives tended to produce more severe renal damage and to be nephrotoxic in smaller doses than aspirin derivatives. With the exception of a single derivative, the renal lesions were confined to the proximal convoluted tubule, even after administration of compounds which under other conditions have induced renal papillary necrosis.
This study was undertaken to determine whether a single night's use of triazolam by normal healthy sleepers leads to withdrawal insomnia on the subsequent night, and whether there is a dose response relationship to this phenomenon. Thirty normal sleepers of both sexes were randomly assigned to three parallel treatment groups. All subjects were studied for five consecutive nights by means of pre- and post-sleep questionnaires and all night polysomnography. Multiple sleep latency tests were conducted on the days following the second, third, and fourth nights in the laboratory. All subjects received placebo capsules on the first, second, fourth, and fifth nights in the laboratory and either placebo, 0.25 mg triazolam or 0.5 mg triazolam according to their assigned group on the third night. Both doses of the drug increased subjective estimates of sleep duration, but no objective increase was found. Neither dose altered daytime measures of sleepiness. No changes were found in any of the sleep parameters on withdrawal of the 0.25 mg dose of triazolam. However, discontinuation of the 0.5 mg dose did lead to significant objective and subjective withdrawal effects. It was concluded that higher doses of triazolam could lead to withdrawal effects in normal sleepers even when this drug was used for only a single night.
Paraoxonase-1 (PON1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) associated enzyme, is involved in the metabolism and detoxification of insecticides and pesticides. Three polymorphisms within the PON1 gene affect the enzyme activity. Two of these (L55M and Q192R) are located at the coding region and the third (-107C/T) is in promoter region. We performed a case-control study in order to elucidate the possible contribution of variability within PON1 at three mentioned positions to the risk of MS in a South-East Iranian population. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of patients (N = 119) with MS and healthy controls (N = 201). Allelic polymorphisms at positions Q192R, L55M and -107C/T in the PON1 gene were studied by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)-PCR. It was observed that genotypes RR and QR + RR of Q192R locus significantly increased the risk of MS (OR = 2; 95% CI: 1.17-3.40, P = 0.0001 and OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.0-2.63; P = 0.05, respectively). The risk in patients with MM and LM + MM genotypes at the L55M locus was marginal (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 0.68-1.85; P = 0.34 and OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.68-1.85; P = 0.73 respectively). The CC genotype at -107C/T locus also increased the risk of metabolic syndrome, but was not significant. This association was somewhat stronger when combined genotypes at Q192R and L55M loci were analyzed (OR = 3.30; 95% CI: 1.34-8.24; P = 0.007). Our results, in this first study, provide evidence for association of PON1 gene polymorphisms with the risk for metabolic syndrome.
Amantadine suppressed severe levodopa-induced choreic dyskinesia, which developed at initiation of levodopa therapy, in two siblings manifesting dystonia with motor delay phenotype of GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency caused by compound heterozygous GCH1 mutations. Our finding suggests a beneficial effect of amantadine on this type of dyskinesia frequently observed in relatively severe dopamine-deficient metabolic disorders.
