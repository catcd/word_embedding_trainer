Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer for men in Europe, North America, and some parts of Africa. Initially, growth of prostate cancer is usually androgen-dependent, but often it becomes androgen-independent after androgen-deprivation therapy. Managing hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma remains a difficult challenge for clinicians. Retinoids, vitamin A and its synthetic analogs are one of the most studied class of chemopreventive drugs for PCa. Retinoids play a key role in several vital functions as vision and development, and also exert anti-proliferative actions. Anti-proliferative effects of retinoids rely on the regulation of many biological processes, including differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Retinoid actions are mediated by two classes of nuclear proteins called retinoic acid (RARalpha,beta and gamma and retinoic alpha,beta and gamma receptors, which are ligand-regulated transcription factors. Effects of both all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), the natural active derivative of vitamin A, and its synthetic derivatives, on prostate gland or prostate cell lines implicate retinoids in the regulation of prostate growth and suppression of PCa development. Deficient retinoid availability and action at the cellular level because of either decreased content or altered metabolism in PCa cells can play a key role in abnormal cellular differentiation pathways, and the loss of anti-proliferative effects. Here we review the in vitro and in vivo effects of retinoids in PCa.
The role of bacteria and nitric oxide (NO), formed by the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS), in a widespread systemic inflammatory microvascular response that follows indomethacin administration, has been investigated in the rat. Subcutaneous administration of indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1)) daily for 2 days produced an increase in microvascular leakage of radiolabelled albumin accompanied by expression of iNOS activity in the lung, liver, spleen and kidney, as well as in the jejunum, caecum, colon and ileum. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1), s.c.) reduced indomethacin-provoked microvascular leakage and the expression of iNOS activity in all the tissues studied. The widespread microvascular leakage and iNOS activity was also inhibited by pretreatment with ampicillin (200 mg kg(-1) day(-1), p.o.), metronidazole (200 mg kg(-1) day(-1), p.o.) or by polymyxin B (15 mg kg(-1) day(-1), s.c.). Administration of the highly selective iNOS inhibitor GW 273629 (3-[[2-(ethanimidoylamino)ethyl]sulphonyl]-L-alanine; five doses of 5 mg kg(-1), s.c. over 48 h) substantially inhibited the microvascular leakage in the affected organs. Such findings suggest the involvement of indigenous gut bacteria, lipopolysaccharide and iNOS expression following indomethacin-induced enteropathy in this widespread systemic inflammatory microvascular response.
The study investigates if alpha-lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity, if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade, and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection. We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid. Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. Alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. These findings suggest that alpha-lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials.
5-Fluorouracil is widely known to be toxic to the hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems. It also has cardiac toxicity, but this is perceived to be rare. During a 16-month period from January 1990 through April 1991, approximately 910 patients were treated with 5-fluorouracil. Five of these developed life-threatening toxicity consistent with coronary artery spasm for an incidence of .55%. The acute events occurred on the third or fourth day of the 5-day infusion and after the fourth intravenous bolus in the patient on bolus therapy. Each of the patients had ST elevation and ventricular arrhythmias, four had acute myocardial infarction, and two had cardiac arrests. In these cases and those previously reported, cardiac toxicity is consistent with drug- or metabolite-mediated increases in coronary vasomotor tone and spasm, leading to the full spectrum of signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia in susceptible individuals.
To evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including akathisia, with quetiapine in patients with bipolar mania.
Data were analyzed from four similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, 3- to 12-week studies. Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy (up to 800 mg/day) (n = 209) versus placebo (n = 198), with lithium or haloperidol monotherapy as respective active controls. Two studies evaluated quetiapine (up to 800 mg/day) in combination with a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex, QTP + Li/DVP) (n = 196) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer (PBO + Li/DVP) (n = 203). Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage.
The incidence of EPS-related adverse events, including akathisia, was no different with quetiapine monotherapy (12.9%) than with placebo (13.1%). Similarly, EPS-related adverse events with QTP + Li/DVP (21.4%) were no different than with PBO + Li/DVP (19.2%). Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with haloperidol (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with lithium (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS. The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy (3.3%) and placebo (6.1%), and with QTP + Li/DVP (3.6%) and PBO + Li/DVP (4.9%). Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.05) of tremor (18.4%) than quetiapine (5.6%); cerebellar tremor, which is a known adverse effect of lithium, may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy. Haloperidol induced a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.001) of akathisia (33.3% versus 5.9%), tremor (30.3% versus 7.8%), and extrapyramidal syndrome (35.4% versus 5.9%) than quetiapine. No significant differences were observed between quetiapine and placebo on SAS and BARS scores. Anticholinergic use was low and similar with quetiapine or placebo.
In bipolar mania, the incidence of EPS, including akathisia, with quetiapine therapy is similar to that with placebo.
Allopurinol, a hypouricemic agent, has been shown to present therapeutic effects in mania associated with hyperuricemia. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of risperidone as an adjunctive agent to lithium and haloperidol for the treatment of acute mania in hospitalized bipolar patients.
Eighty-two patients aged between 18 and 49 were eligible to participate, as they met the DSM-IV criteria for a current manic episode, on the basis of a clinical interview by two academician psychiatrists. In addition, a score of at least 20 points on the Young Mania Rating Scale was required representing at least a moderate-to-severe mania. Forty-one patients were randomly allocated to lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L) + haloperidol (10 mg/day) + allopurinol (300 mg/day) (group A) or lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L) + haloperidol (10 mg/day) + placebo (group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were assessed by a third-year resident of psychiatry at baseline and at 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days after the medication started. The mean decrease in the Young Mania Rating Scale score from baseline was used as the main outcome measure of response of mania to treatment. The extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS). Side effects were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist.
Young Mania Rating Scale scores improved with allopurinol. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of the group, the between-subjects factor (F = 5.22, df = 1, p = 0.008). The mean ESRS scores for the placebo group were higher than the allopurinol group. However, the differences were not significant over the trial. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant except for agitation that was more often in the placebo group.
The efficacy of allopurinol to obtain a greater improvement in patients with mania seems to support the purinergic dysfunction in mania.
We studied two patients with Meige syndrome who developed alpha-methyldopa-induced parkinsonism. Opposite responses of parkinsonian and dystonic symptoms to antiparkinson drugs in some cases suggest a functionally reciprocal relationship between these disorders.
Two potent cooked food mutagens, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo/4,5-f/quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo/4,5-f/quinoline (MeIQ), were examined in an initiation-promotion assay in the male wistar rat. Fourteen doses of 10 mg IQ or 10 mg MeIQ/kg b.wt. were given during initiation, followed by promotion with 500 p.p.m. phenobarbital sodium (PB) in the drinking water up to week 58. A small number of tumours of Zymbal's gland were seen in all groups treated with IQ or MeIQ, irrespective of PB-treatment. Though the promotional regimen failed to produce the expected number of liver tumours, it did induce a significant amount of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) activity. These results suggest that even short exposures to low doses of IQ or MeIQ produce persistent procarcinogenic lesions in the rat, and that secondary factors, e.g. promoters or high cell turnover, may over time develop these lesions into cancer.
To determine whether a diuretic can also reverse the clinical, systemic, renal and glomerular haemodynamic and pathological changes caused by nephrosclerosis.
Three groups of 20-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were investigated: control male SHR; a similar group, administered 50 mg/l NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 3 weeks; and SHR treated similarly with L-NAME but also with 80 mg/kg per day hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) by gavage for 3 weeks.
The mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate decreased as urinary volume increased in the SHR treated with HCTZ and L-NAME. A micropuncture study demonstrated increased glomerular capillary pressure (PG, 56 +/- 1 versus 68 +/- 3 mmHg) associated with increased efferent (2.1 +/- 0.2 versus 2.9 +/- 0.3 u) but no change in afferent arteriolar resistances compared with the SHR group treated with L-NAME only. In addition, HCTZ administration increased the juxtamedullary glomerular injury score (47 +/- 13 versus 114 +/- 29) associated with elevated urinary protein excretion (35 +/- 1 versus 53 +/- 13 mg/100 g body weight per 24 h) The afferent arteriolar injury score was not changed. The PG elevation was related not only to severe glomerulosclerosis but also to increased fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin deposition.
HCTZ administration exacerbated the changes in renal and micropuncture dynamics, proteinuria and histopathological nephrosclerosis produced by L-NAME in SHR.
Mitochondrial DNA from two genetically unrelated patients carrying the mutation at position 11778 that causes Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy has been transferred with mitochondria into human mtDNA-less rho0206 cells. As analyzed in several transmitochondrial cell lines thus obtained, the mutation, which is in the gene encoding subunit ND4 of the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (ND), did not affect the synthesis, size, or stability of ND4, nor its incorporation into the enzyme complex. However, NADH dehydrogenase-dependent respiration, as measured in digitonin-permeabilized cells, was specifically decreased by approximately 40% in cells carrying the mutation. This decrease, which was significant at the 99.99% confidence level, was correlated with a significantly reduced ability of the mutant cells to grow in a medium containing galactose instead of glucose, indicating a clear impairment in their oxidative phosphorylation capacity. On the contrary, no decrease in rotenone-sensitive NADH dehydrogenase activity, using a water-soluble ubiquinone analogue as electron acceptor, was detected in disrupted mitochondrial membranes. This is the first cellular model exhibiting in a foreign nuclear background mitochondrial DNA-linked biochemical defects underlying the optic neuropathy phenotype.
Cardiac toxicity significantly correlates with the lipophilicity of local anesthetics (LAs). Recently, the infusion of lipid emulsions has been shown to be a promising approach to treat LA-induced cardiac arrest. As the postulated mechanism of action, the so-called "lipid sink" effect may depend on the lipophilicity of LAs. In this study, we investigated whether lipid effects differ with regard to the administered LAs.
In the isolated rat heart, cardiac arrest was induced by administration of equipotent doses of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and mepivacaine, respectively, followed by cardiac perfusion with or without lipid emulsion (0.25 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Subsequently, the times from the start of perfusion to return of first heart activity and to recovery of heart rate and rate-pressure product (to 90% of baseline values) were assessed.
In all groups, lipid infusion had no effects on the time to the return of any cardiac activity. However, recovery times of heart rate and rate-pressure product (to 90% of baseline values) were significantly shorter with the administration of lipids in bupivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity, but not in ropivacaine- or mepivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity.
These data show that the effects of lipid infusion on LA-induced cardiac arrest are strongly dependent on the administered LAs itself. We conclude that lipophilicity of LAs has a marked impact on the efficacy of lipid infusions to treat cardiac arrest induced by these drugs.
Codeine often causes gastrointestinal cramping and pain. Treatment for such symptoms is usually symptomatic and supportive. Although naloxone is commonly used to treat other medical problems due to opiates, its use in treating such cramping has not been previously reported. The authors present four cases in which naloxone (Narcan) was used with success in relieving gastrointestinal side effects that were apparently due to codeine. It is suggested that patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and a history that strongly implicates codeine as the etiology be treated with naloxone.
Pulmonary fibrosis is a common consequence of numerous pulmonary diseases. The current therapeutic approaches for this condition are unsatisfactory. Feitai, a composite formula consisting of several herbs, is used in China as a folk remedy for treating patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. In this study, we extensively investigate the effects and mechanisms of Feitai on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. One hundred and twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, referred to as the saline-water, saline-Feitai, BLM-water, and BLM-Feitai groups. Following a single instillation of BLM (5 mg/kg) or saline, rats were orally administered Feitai at a dose of 3 g/kg body weight or sterilized distilled water once daily. Rats were killed at 7, 14, or 28 d post-BLM. Inflammatory cell count, protein concentration, and lactate dehydrogenase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured, and myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxide content in lung homogenates were analyzed. Treatment with Feitai inhibited lung fibrotic progression induced by BLM, as indicated by the decrease in lung hydroproline content and lung fibrosis score at 28 d post-BLM. This was accompanied by significant amelioration of BLM-induced body weight loss, lung edema, and inflammatory response during the development of lung injury in the acute phase. The results strongly indicate the beneficial effects of Feitai in protecting against BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, the inflammatory response and lipid peroxidation were inhibited by Feitai, suggesting that the effect of this formula on BLM-induced lung injury and fibrosis is associated with antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties.
Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare inherited autosomal syndrome caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRb) gene. Although RTH is generally a familiar disease, 15% of sporadic cases have been also reported. So far, about 80 different mutations of TRb gene have been identified in patients affected by RTH. All these mutations localize to the binding domain and most of them cluster within two "hot spots" (codons 310-349 and codons 429-460). Here we describe in a patient with RTH, a new mutation in codon 426 (T426I) of the TRb gene leading to a threonine to isoleucine substitution. This is a "de nova" mutation which localizes in the so-called "cold" region, outside the two known "hot spots". The patient had the hallmark of RTH: elevated FT3 and FT4, normal TSH, and clinical features of both hypo and hyperthyroidism. Moreover, several dysmorphisms were present including triangular face appearance, synophris, low set ears, micrognathia with malocclusion, large upper incisors and apparent lack of lower cuspids which have not previously described in RTH patients.
Acute rhabdomyolysis under treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ("statins") is a group-specific if rare side effect. Muscle toxicity of statins can be potentiated by medication influencing their metabolism. Here drug interactions on the level of the microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes play an important role. We report the first case of marked rhabdomyolysis with cholestatic hepatitis in a 73-year-old woman treated with simvastatin and chlorzoxazone. Withdrawal of the causal medication and conservative therapy with volume substitution and forced diuresis was followed by almost complete resolution of the symptoms with normalisation of the blood tests. Possible mechanisms involved in the drug interactions are discussed. Thorough knowledge of the enzyme systems involved in drug metabolism helps to predict possible adverse drug interactions and prevent toxic effects.
Regional values for cerebral blood flow, blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction, and oxygen utilization were measured, using PET, in 10 brain tumor patients before and after treatment with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone treatment decreased cerebral blood flow and blood volume and increased the fractional extraction of oxygen throughout the brain without affecting oxygen utilization. Dexamethasone probably causes direct vasoconstriction of cerebral blood vessels.
We sought to determine the incidence and severity of bleeding events in patients with stroke and cardiovascular diseases who were taking oral antithrombotic agents in Japan, where the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke is higher than in Western countries.
A prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted; 4009 patients who were taking oral antithrombotic agents for stroke and cardiovascular diseases were enrolled. The patients were classified into 4 groups according to their antithrombotic treatment: the single antiplatelet agent group (47.2%); the dual antiplatelet agent group (8.7%); the warfarin group (32.4%); and the warfarin plus antiplatelet agent group (11.7%). The primary end point was life-threatening or major bleeding according to the MATCH trial definition.
During a median follow-up of 19 months, there were 57 life-threatening and 51 major bleeding events, including 31 intracranial hemorrhages. The annual incidence of the primary end point was 1.21% in the single antiplatelet agent group, 2.00% in the dual antiplatelet agent group, 2.06% in the warfarin group, and 3.56% in the warfarin plus antiplatelet agent group (P<0.001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, adding an antiplatelet agent to warfarin increased the risk of the primary end point (relative risk=1.76; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.95), and adding another antiplatelet agent to single antiplatelet agent therapy increased the secondary end point of any bleeding, including minor events (relative risk=1.37; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.76).
The incidence of bleeding events during antithrombotic therapy in Japan was similar to that reported for Western countries, although the trials used different study designs. Dual antithrombotic therapy was independently related to an increased risk of bleeding events.
The antiplatelet agent sarpogrelate is a selective inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of sarpogrelate with those of aspirin in Japanese ischemic stroke patients.
In total, 1510 patients with recent cerebral infarction (1 week to 6 months after onset) were randomly assigned to receive either sarpogrelate (100 mg TID) or aspirin (81 mg/d). Mean follow-up period was 1.59 years. The primary efficacy end point was recurrence of cerebral infarction. Clusters of serious vascular events (stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or vascular event-related death) were selected as secondary end points. The aim of the primary efficacy analysis was to demonstrate the noninferiority of sarpogrelate with respect to aspirin, with the criterion that the upper limit of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio (sarpogrelate vs aspirin) for recurrence of cerebral infarction should not exceed 1.33.
Cerebral infarction recurred in 72 patients (6.09%/y) in the sarpogrelate group and in 58 (4.86%/y) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio=1.25; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.77; P=0.19). A serious vascular event occurred in 90 (7.61%/y) and in 85 (7.12%/y) patients, respectively (hazard ratio=1.07; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.44; P=0.65). The overall incidences of bleeding events were 89 (11.9%) and 131 (17.3%), respectively (P<0.01).
Sarpogrelate was not noninferior to aspirin for prevention of recurrence of cerebral infarction. Bleeding events were significantly fewer with sarpogrelate than aspirin. The effect of aspirin in Japanese patients was similar to that in Western studies.
The National Toxicology Program recently completed long-term ozone inhalation studies in B6C3F1 mice and F344/N rats. Mice and rats were exposed to 0, 0.5 or 1.0 p.p.m. ozone by inhalation for 24 or 30 months. There was an increased incidence of lung neoplasms in B6C3F1 mice. However, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in F344/N rats. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate benign and malignant lung neoplasms from B6C3F1 mice for mutations in the K-ras gene at codons 12, 13 and 61, (ii) determine if the frequency and spectra of K-ras mutations were unique for ozone-induced lung neoplasms, (iii) determine if specific K-ras mutations were associated with the size and morphological patterns of lung neoplasms or ozone exposure concentrations and (iv) screen lung neoplasms by immunohistochemical methods for the p53 protein. K-ras mutations were detected by single-strand conformation analysis and identified by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded neoplasms. K-ras mutations were detected in 73% of ozone-induced neoplasms, as compared with 33% of lung neoplasms from controls. The predominant mutations consisted of A-->T transversions at codon 61 (8/19) and G-->T transversions at codon 12 (7/19). Specific K-ras mutations in lung neoplasms were not associated with various morphological patterns. Our data suggests that ozone may cause direct and/or indirect DNA damage in the K-ras proto-oncogene of B6C3F1 mice.
In a group of 72 patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent a maximal symptom-limited predischarge exercise test in conjunction with radionuclide angiography, 25 (35%) showed greater than 1 mm asymptomatic ST-T-segment depression during exercise. All 25 patients underwent repeated exercise radionuclide angiography 2 days later, 2 h after oral intake of 120 mg diltiazem. Double product was not significantly different before and after diltiazem both at rest and during exercise. Maximal ST-T-segment depression after diltiazem was reduced from 2.4 +/- 0.9 mm to 0.8 +/- 0.6 mm (p less than 0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest was (before diltiazem) 52.1 +/- 8.9% and (after diltiazem) 55.1 +/- 12.3% (NS). During exercise, LVEF improved after diltiazem from 42.8 +/- 12.1% to 49.1 +/- 10.8% (p less than 0.05). Regional wall motion score (1 = normal, 2 = hypokinetic, 3 = akinetic, 4 = dyskinetic) at rest before diltiazem was 9.9 +/- 2.3 and, after diltiazem, was 9.0 +/- 1.9 (NS). During exercise, regional wall motion score improved after diltiazem from 5.9 +/- 1.3 to 4.2 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.02). We conclude that diltiazem has acute beneficial effects on asymptomatic ST-T-segment depression and on global and regional left ventricular function in post-infarction patients with silent ischemia.
Female BALB/c mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of 0, 2.5, 5.0 or 7.5 mg methyl mercury chloride per kg body weight and subjected to the dominant lethal assay at 6 different time intervals between exposure and mating. Cyclophosphamide (210 mg/kg body weight) was used as a positive control. The main observation appeared to be a statistically highly significant increase in especially pre- and early post-implantation foetal losses. This was most evident when all data (the 6 consecutive weeks of mating) were pooled.
