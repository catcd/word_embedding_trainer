Macroscopic T-wave alternans (TWA) is sometimes observed after sodium channel blocker administration in patients with Brugada syndrome (BS), but little is known about the association between occurrence of TWA and clinical characteristics in BS patients. We investigated the association between spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurrence and TWA after pilsicainide, a sodium channel blocker administration in BS patients.
We administered pilsicainide at a dose of 1 mg/kg to 77 BS patients (76 males and one female; mean age, 48.4 years) and examined the association between TWA after pilsicainide administration and clinical characteristics, including age, spontaneous VF, syncope, family history of sudden death, spontaneous coved ST elevation, late potentials (LP), induction of VF by programmed electrical stimulation, and SCN5A mutation. None of the patients had TWA before pilsicainide administration, but TWA became apparent in 17 (22.1%) of the patients after pilsicainide administration. Patients with TWA had a significantly higher incidence of spontaneous VF (52.9% vs 8.3%, P < 0.001) and syncope (58.8% vs 26.7%, P < 0.05) than did patients without TWA. Then, we focused on the association between spontaneous VF and clinical characteristics. Patients with spontaneous VF had a significantly higher incidence of TWA (64.3% vs 12.7%, P < 0.001) and LP positive (92.9% vs 56.5%, P < 0.01) than did patients without spontaneous VF. In multivariate analysis, TWA (P = 0.001) and LP (P = 0.047) appeared as the independent predictor for spontaneous VF.
TWA after pilsicainide administration is associated with a high risk of clinical VF in patients with BS.
Development of a preventive strategy against tubular damage associated with proteinuria is of great importance. Recently, free fatty acid (FFA) toxicities accompanying proteinuria were found to be a main cause of tubular damage, which was aggravated by insufficiency of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), suggesting the benefit of PPARα activation. However, an earlier study using a murine acute tubular injury model, FFA-overload nephropathy, demonstrated that high-dose treatment of PPARα agonist (0.5% clofibrate diet) aggravated the tubular damage as a consequence of excess serum accumulation of clofibrate metabolites due to decreased kidney elimination. To induce the renoprotective effects of PPARα agonists without drug accumulation, we tried a pretreatment study using low-dose clofibrate (0.1% clofibrate diet) using the same murine model. Low-dose clofibrate pretreatment prevented acute tubular injuries without accumulation of its metabolites. The tubular protective effects appeared to be associated with the counteraction of PPARα deterioration, resulting in the decrease of FFAs influx to the kidney, maintenance of fatty acid oxidation, diminution of intracellular accumulation of undigested FFAs, and attenuation of disease developmental factors including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and NFκB activation. These effects are common to other fibrates and dependent on PPARα function. Interestingly, however, clofibrate pretreatment also exerted PPARα-independent tubular toxicities in PPARα-null mice with FFA-overload nephropathy. The favorable properties of fibrates are evident when PPARα-dependent tubular protective effects outweigh their PPARα-independent tubular toxicities. This delicate balance seems to be easily affected by the drug dose. It will be important to establish the appropriate dosage of fibrates for treatment against kidney disease and to develop a novel PPARα activator that has a steady serum concentration regardless of kidney dysfunction.
Due to its extensive production and application, the toxicity of chloracetanilide herbicide alachlor[2-chloro-2',6'-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl)-acetanilide] should be evaluated to establish minimum effects. In this study, we have examined the in vitro effects of alachlor on human sperm motion using a computer-assisted sperm analyser (CASA). An evaluation of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and markers of apoptosis was also performed to investigate the mechanism by which alachlor modifies the sperm movement. After exposure up to 2 h to alachlor (0, 0.18, 0.37, 0.90 and 1.85 mM), the percentage of viable, motile spermatozoa and sperm velocities were concentration and/or time dependently decreased. The most sensitive parameters were progressive motility, mean average path velocity and mean straight velocity. Alachlor (1.85 mM) induced an increase in ROS production. A decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), an increase of both phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and DNA fragmentation, which were concentration and/or time dependent, were also observed. It is possible that toxic effects of alachlor result in an oxidative stress which could act as a mediator of apoptosis. Alachlor could also contribute to some hypofertility cases.
To report a case of dystonia as an adverse effect of gabapentin.
A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed with essential tremor and treated with propranolol 120 mg daily. The drug was withdrawn because of bradycardia, and gabapentin was prescribed 3 times a day at escalating doses to reach 2100 mg daily. The woman developed a dystonic reaction involving muscles of the neck and both arms that resolved rapidly after drug withdrawal. She was restarted on gabapentin with slow titration to 1800 mg daily, but the same dystonic reaction appeared, which led to definitive withdrawal of the drug. An objective causality assessment revealed that this adverse effect was highly probable.
There have been only a few previous reports of gabapentin-induced dystonia. Other movement disorders reported with gabapentin include myoclonus, ataxia, and choreoathetosis. Gabapentin has been used to treat dystonias with variable results.
Although gabapentin is widely used and well tolerated, it can cause dystonic reactions, which are reversible after drug withdrawal.
A possible association between treatment with methyldopa and the occurrence of renal stones was sought by retrospectively comparing 54 hypertensive patients with calculi detected by X-ray examination with a control group matched for age and sex. Treatment with methyldopa was equally frequent in both groups. There was a significant excess of methyldopa use in a subgroup of 16 patients with bilateral calculi, but the drug could be the primary cause of stone formation in, at most, four of these patients. If methyldopa does cause renal stones, it is probably an uncommon event, but precipitation of the drug from the urine may worsen a tendency to stone formation, which will lead to a higher incidence of bilateral calculi.
The QTc interval prolongation is not a perfect surrogate marker of the presence of an increased risk for arrhythmic events. In the search for alternative markers, we investigated the T-amplitude and QT interval adaptation to heart rate (HR) in patients with the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) and individuals with sotalol-induced QT prolongation.
Our investigation is based on the analysis of continuous 12-lead digital Holter recordings in: 49 LQT1 carriers, 25 LQT2 carriers, 37 healthy individuals off drugs and on 160 mg of sotalol, and 21 of them also on 320 mg of sotalol. The Holter recordings were used to investigate repolarization parameters and their HR dependency. A loss of HR dependency of the T-amplitude was found as a common feature in individuals with impaired I(kr) kinetics: LQT2 carriers and subjects on sotalol. The T-amplitude/RR slope was significantly (P < 0.05) flatter in LQT2 (0.31 +/- 0.27 microV/ms) than in both LQT1 (0.62 +/- 0.40 microV/ms) and healthy individuals (0.55 +/- 0.29 microV/ms). A dose-dependent reduction of the T-amplitude/RR slope was also observed in subjects on sotalol (160 mg dose: 0.26 +/- 0.19 microV/ms; 320 mg dose: 0.21 +/- 0.14 microV/ms). The QT/RR slope was less effective than T-amplitude/RR slope in differentiating between congenital and drug-induced repolarization delay.
Impaired adaptation of T-amplitude to changing HR is a common electrocardiographic feature associated with KCNH2 mutation and I(kr) blockade by sotalol. This ECG marker may play an important role in the future of the assessment of the penetrance of KCNH2 mutation and the identification of a drug effect on the I(kr) kinetics.
Quercetin has been shown to possess beneficial pharmacological properties in treatment of heart disease, but lack of stability and bioavailability limits its clinical use. In this study, we investigated for the first time the effect of a methylated form of quercetin, 3,3',4',5,7-pentamethylquercetin (PMQ), on myocardial protection in rats. Angiotensin II was delivered to Sprague-Dawley rats subcutaneously, while PMQ (5 mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage; blood pressure was monitored daily. The production of NADPH oxidase was measured, and cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis were detected. The results revealed that PMQ could downregulate the expression of the NADPH oxidase gene and reduce angiotensin II- induced cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis in rats. Therefore, we believe that PMQ showed beneficial effects on myocardium in angiotensin II-administered rats, and its potential to be used for treatment of cardiovascular disease deserves further attention.
Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Hepatic toxicity associated with flutamide has been reported with an incidence from less than 1% to about 5%. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid, has been widely used in the treatment of cholesterol gallstones and of several liver diseases, but few data are now available concerning its use in the management of drug-induced hepatitis. The case of a patient who presented severe hepatitis with jaundice following use of flutamide is reported. UDCA treatment was started on admission and, contemporaneously, flutamide was withdrawn. Clinical and biochemical improvement was progressively observed, and the patient was discharged six weeks after the admission. Since fatal flutamide-related hepatitis has been reported, monitoring of serum liver tests is advocated during flutamide administration, and the effectiveness of UDCA in the treatment of drug-induced hepatotoxicity requires further study.
After removal of an herniated intervertebral disc a 49-year-old man had recurrent pain in the lumbar region, treated with diclofenac and flupirtine. 4 months postoperatively he was referred to the author's hospital because of progressive rise in transaminase levels and in cholestasis parameters. Physical examination on admissions was unremarkable, except for jaundice.
Laboratory tests showed an increases in transaminases (GPT 769 U/l [normal: < 23 U/l], GOT 285 U/l [normal: < 19 U/l]) and in cholestasis-related values (gamma-GT 172 U/l [Norm 6-28 U/l], alkaline phosphatase 207 U/l [normal < 175 U/l], total bilirubin: 2.5 mg/dl [Norm < 1.1 mg/dl]). This corresponded to the histological finding of toxic damage to the liver parenchyma. Viral, autoimmune and metabolic causes had been excluded. DIAGNOSES, TREATMENT AND COURSE: The history as well as laboratory and histological findings indicated diclofenac-induced toxic hepatitis. The drug was discontinued and without any treatment all laboratory values returned to normal within 9 weeks.
Diclofenac, a frequently prescribed non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, is generally thought to be relatively safe. But it can produce toxic hepatitis which may be asymptomatic (but this patient was jaundiced) and may take an unforeseeable course. This should be taken account of by regularly monitoring liver functions.
A 23-year-old woman experienced six distinct episodes of severe combined neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. At least one of the episodes was accompanied by hemodialysis-requiring acute renal failure and fragmentation hemolysis (hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS]). In retrospect, all episodes were probably associated with the ingestion of quinine. Quinine-dependent antibodies to platelets, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and red blood cells (RBCs) were detected in the patient's serum. By a monoclonal antibody antigen capture assay, the patient's serum contained IgG antibodies, which in the presence, but not absence, of quinine reacted with platelet glycoprotein (GP) complexes Ib/IX and IIb/IIIa, but not Ia/IIa. By immunoprecipitation assay, the serum, after addition of quinine, reacted strongly with an 85-Kd neutrophil membrane protein and weakly with 130- and 60-Kd moieties. Serum adsorbed with RBCs in the presence of quinine continued to react with platelets and neutrophils, and serum that was absorbed with platelets continued to react with neutrophils and RBCs, indicating that the antigenic targets were different on platelets, neutrophils, and RBCs. Since platelets and endothelial cells share some antigens, we tested patient serum for antibodies to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC); no quinine-dependent antibodies to HUVEC were detected. However, her quinine-dependent antibodies not only bound to platelets and neutrophils, but also activated neutrophils. Thus, the patient's serum with quinine aggregated neutrophils, but neither agent alone caused activation. Moreover, the patient's serum with quinine (but not without) augmented the adherence of neutrophils to HUVEC. Treatment of the patient's serum with staphylococcal protein A removed the quinine neutrophil aggregation cofactor, suggesting it was due to IgG. In both neutrophil aggregation and adherence assays, decomplementation of the patient's serum markedly blunted its effect. Furthermore, the patient's serum failed to aggregate formalin-inactivated neutrophils, suggesting neutrophil activation, probably by activated complement, was necessary for aggregation and adhesivity to endothelium. We conclude that our patient's neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and anemia were due to quinine-dependent antibodies, and that these antibodies recognized epitopes that were different in the three target cell populations. We further suggest that HUS was likely secondary to the activation and adhesion of neutrophils to endothelium.
Myocardial infarction (MI) activates the renin-angiotensin system in the heart and increases local production of aldosterone. This hormone may increase reactive fibrosis in the myocardium favoring heart failure development. To elucidate the potential contribution of aldosterone to cardiac remodeling following MI, we evaluated the expression of mineralocorticoid receptors (MCR) in the left ventricle (LV) and kidney of rats after MI and captopril treatment. MI was induced by ligation of the coronary artery in Wistar rats, which were separated into (1) sham-operated group, (2) MI group, (3) MI-captopril treated group (cap, 50 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). One month later angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was assayed in the plasma, LV and kidney. Cardiac and renal angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were determined by ELISA and MCR mRNA expression and protein were measured by Taqman RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cardiac MCR mRNA and protein levels increased nearly by 80% after MI and Cap treatment normalized cardiac MCR protein and mRNA expression. Kidney MCR expression was not affected. ACE activity increased 34% in the plasma and 83% in the LV after MI. This increase was prevented by Cap. Ang II concentration increased 225% in the LV and 193% in kidney, which was partially attenuated by Cap. Our data demonstrate upregulation of MCR in the heart following MI what may facilitate the effects of aldosterone in the ventricular remodeling process. ACE inhibitors may reduce reactive fibrosis not only by decreasing Ang II production but also by attenuating the aldosterone-signaling pathway by decreasing the expression of MCR receptors.
Opioids can induce hyperalgesia in humans and in animals. Mechanisms of opiate-induced hyperalgesia and possibly of spinal antinociceptive tolerance may be linked to pronociceptive adaptations occurring at multiple levels of the nervous system including activation of descending facilitatory influences from the brainstem, spinal neuroplasticity, and changes in primary afferent fibers. Here, the role of NK-1 receptor expressing cells in the spinal dorsal horn in morphine-induced hyperalgesia and spinal antinociceptive tolerance was assessed by ablating these cells with intrathecal injection of SP-saporin (SP-SAP). Ablation of NK-1 receptor expressing cells prevented (a) morphine-induced thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity, (b) increased touch-evoked spinal FOS expression, (c) upregulation of spinal dynorphin content and (d) the rightward displacement of the spinal morphine antinociceptive dose-response curve (i.e., tolerance). Morphine-induced hyperalgesia and antinociceptive tolerance were also blocked by spinal administration of ondansetron, a serotonergic receptor antagonist. Thus, NK-1 receptor expressing neurons play a critical role in sustained morphine-induced neuroplastic changes which underlie spinal excitability reflected as thermal and tactile hypersensitivity to peripheral stimuli, and to reduced antinociceptive actions of spinal morphine (i.e., antinociceptive tolerance). Ablation of these cells likely eliminates the ascending limb of a spinal-bulbospinal loop that engages descending facilitation and elicits subsequent spinal neuroplasticity. The data may provide a basis for understanding mechanisms of prolonged pain which can occur in the absence of tissue injury.
Mesna is a sulfhydryl compound that reacts with the metabolites of cyclophosphamide that are excreted in the urine and may produce bladder wall irritation. Mesna is converted in the blood to a biochemically inactive compound that is reduced back to mesna in the kidneys. In this way it has the potential to protect the bladder mucosa without interfering with the antineoplastic effect of cyclophosphamide. Twenty-two patients who had developed hemorrhagic cystitis from cyclophosphamide were treated again with cyclophosphamide and mesna prophylaxis. A total of 68 cycles of cyclophosphamide were given with mesna, with a median of three cycles per patient. A recurrence of cystitis was prevented in all but one patient. Thus, mesna is effective in preventing recurrent cystitis in patients receiving further cyclophosphamide.
The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays an essential role in tumorigenesis, and the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1) has been suggested to export p53 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate p53 expression and subcellular localization as well as CRM1 expression using immunohistochemistry in our established bitransgenic mouse lung tumor model. In this model, expression of the mutant human Ki-rasG12C allele was regulated in a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible, lung-specific manner. Following treatment with curcumin, we found that although overall p53 expression levels were not significantly changed among the three groups, lung lesions in mice treated with DOX alone had the highest proportion of N>C (nucleus predominant) p53 staining (46±7%), followed by lung lesions in mice co-treated with DOX and curcumin (31±12%) and controls (17±4%). CRM1 expression was dramatically inhibited in lung lesions in mice treated with DOX (0±0) as compared to controls (90±17, P=0.001), and could be partially reversed after curcumin treatment (47±21, P=0.028, DOX vs. DOX+curcumin). Collectively, the results from this study demonstrated that p53 accumulated in the nucleus in lung lesions in mice expressing the mutant Ki-rasG12C transgene as a result of down-regulation of CRM1. Furthermore, these alterations could be partially reversed by curcumin treatment. p53 subcellular localization resulting from CRM1 alterations may play an important role in lung tumorigenesis.
The in vivo effect of inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) upon oedema volume and FAAH activity was evaluated in the carrageenan induced hind paw inflammation model in the mouse. Oedema was measured at two time points, 2 and 4 h, after intraplantar injection of carrageenan to anaesthetised mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 (0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg kg(-1)) 30 min prior to carrageenan administration, dose-dependently reduced oedema formation. At the 4 h time point, the ED(50) for URB597 was approximately 0.3 mg kg(-1). Indomethacin (5 mg kg(-1) i.p.) completely prevented the oedema response to carrageenan. The antioedema effects of indomethacin and URB597 were blocked by 3 mg kg(-1) i.p. of the CB(2) receptor antagonist SR144528. The effect of URB597 was not affected by pretreatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma antagonist bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (30 mg kg(-1) i.p.) or the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.), when oedema was assessed 4 h after carrageenan administration. The CB(1) receptor antagonists AM251 (3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and rimonabant (0.5 mg kg(-1) i.p.) gave inconsistent effects upon the antioedema effect of URB597. FAAH measurements were conducted ex vivo in the paws, spinal cords and brains of the mice. The activities of FAAH in the paws and spinal cords of the inflamed vehicle-treated mice were significantly lower than the corresponding activities in the noninflamed mice. PMSF treatment almost completely inhibited the FAAH activity in all three tissues, as did the highest dose of URB597 (3 mg kg(-1)) in spinal cord samples, whereas no obvious changes were seen ex vivo for the other treatments. In conclusion, the results show that in mice, treatment with indomethacin and URB597 produce SR144528-sensitive anti-inflammatory effects in the carrageenan model of acute inflammation.
Previous studies suggested that the onset of phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth depended on serum phenytoin concentration. Cytochrome P450 2C (CYP2C) plays an important role in phenytoin metabolism. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of CYP 2C influencing phenytoin metabolism were identified. The purpose of the present study was to see if CYP 2C polymorphisms might relate to the onset and severity of phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth. Twenty-eight epileptic patients taking phenytoin aged 15 to 75 (mean age: 42.2 years old, 20 males and 8 females) and 56 unrelated healthy subjects aged 30 to 48 (mean age: 36.8 years old, 48 males and 8 females) were examined for CYP 2C polymorphisms. All epileptic subjects were examined for the degree of gingival overgrowth, daily phenytoin dose and serum phenytoin concentration. The results indicated about 7% of the subjects including epileptic and healthy subjects examined were positive for CYP 2C9*3. However, the degree of gingival overgrowth did not directly correlate with CYP 2C polymorphisms. Nevertheless, the subjects with severer gingival overgrowth exhibited significantly higher serum phenytoin concentration, indicating that phenytoin metabolism is an important determinant for the severity of the disease. Additionally, CYP 2C9*3 carriers exhibited significantly higher serum drug concentration to drug dose. Therefore, we concluded although the gene analysis is not directly related to diagnose the disease itself, it can be utilized in estimating serum phenytoin concentration from drug dose, which in turn serves to predict the future development and clinical course of the disease.
Two women with connective tissue disease developed a characteristic steroid-induced myopathy. Reduced maximal transrespiratory pressures indicated reduced respiratory muscle strength. Gradual steroid dosage tapering resulted in prompt clinical improvement and marked increases in respiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory pressure increasing by 33 percent in one patient and by 70 percent in the other. This reversible steroid-induced respiratory muscle weakness may be of great significance in reconsidering long-term steroid therapy in patients with underlying lung disease.
Twenty-nine patients with gynaecological cancers who received over 400 mg of doxorubicin were monitored electrocardiographically to determine whether cardiac glycosides countered the adverse effects of high total doses of doxorubicin. Minor electrocardiographical changes were noted in five out of six patients who were not receiving a cardiac glycoside and four out of six who were receiving ouabain, and none of the 16 who were receiving digoxin. One other patient on digoxin stopped taking it and developed cardiomyopathy. One patient on ouabain also developed cardiomyopathy. So far nine patients on digoxin have received between 550 and 1000 mg/m2 of doxorubicin without ill effect. Cardiac glycosides are thought to prevent doxorubicin cardiomyopathy by competitively inhibiting doxorubicin at its receptor sites, but ouabain has a much shorter half life than doxorubicin and its metabolites and so is less effective than digoxin.
Dichloromethane sensitizes the myocardium to arrhythmia development in response to catecholamines. The effects of acute dichloromethane exposure (3.1, 6.2 or 12.4 mmol/kg) on cardiovascular actions of epinephrine (1 or 4 micrograms/kg iv) and norepinephrine (2 or 10 micrograms/kg iv) in the urethane-anaesthetized rat model was investigated. Hypertensive epinephrine effects as well as reflex bradycardia after epinephrine and norepinephrine injections were augmented in dichloromethane-exposed rats. Moreover we observed an enhanced negative dromotropic epinephrine action. The transient T-wave elevation after catecholamine injection was markedly increased in animals treated with 12.4 mmol/kg dichloromethane. The results show that dichloromethane exposure modifies cardiovascular actions after catecholamine administration. The release by dichloromethane of endogenous catecholamines could play a role in the manifestation of these effects.
The development of resistance to cisplatin during treatment of testicular cancer constitutes a major obstacle to the cure of testicular cancer. To resolve its mechanism will provide useful information for making clinical decisions. We found 4 and 15 gene expressions were, respectively, up-regulated and down-regulated in cisplatin-resistant testicular cancer NEC-8/DDP cells compared with their parental NEC-8 cells (about 2.5-fold) using cDNA microarray analysis. After screening, we selected the ENTPD6 among these 19 genes. ENTPD6 was less expressed in cancerous region compared with that in non-cancerous lesion. In addition, ENTPD6 expression in seminoma was higher than that in other testicular tumors. ENTPD6 expression was involved in cellular sensitivity to cisplatin through an interaction with E-cadherin. ENTPD6 is a promising molecular biomarker of cisplatin resistance in testicular cancer, and also a novel therapeutical target modulating cisplatin resistance in testicular cancer.
Cardiotoxicity and musculoskeletal toxicity can be life-threatening, and thus have strong impact on both the development and marketing of drugs. Because the conventional biomarkers such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) have low detection power, there has been increasing interest in developing biomarkers with higher detection power. The current study examined the usefulness of several promising biomarkers, cardiac and skeletal muscle troponins (cTnI, cTnT and sTnI), fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3) and myosin light chain 3 (MYL3), and compared the obtained data to AST, LDH and CK in rat models treated with various myotoxic and non-myotoxic compounds (isoproterenol, metaproterenol, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, allylamine, cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, aminoglutethimide, acetaminophen, methapyrilene, allylalcohol and α-naphthylisothiocyanate). These promising biomarkers were found to be superior to the conventional biomarkers, as they had a specific and abundant distribution within the heart and/or skeletal muscles; exhibited a positive correlation between the amplitude of increases and the degree of pathological alterations; had higher diagnostic accuracy for detecting pathological alterations; and had the additive effect of improving the diagnostic accuracy of conventional biomarkers. However, these promising biomarkers have several drawbacks including a rapid clearance, the fact that they are affected by renal dysfunction, and different reactivity to the mode of action of individual myotoxicants. In conclusion, the promising biomarkers cTnI, cTnT, FABP3, MYL3, and sTnI demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for cardiac and skeletal myotoxicity that was superior to those of conventional biomarkers, while we should pay attention to the drawbacks of these biomarkers when used in toxicity studies.
