Spontaneous or steroid-induced eosinophil apoptosis occurring in vitro has not been demonstrated in lung tissues in vivo. This study examines cell apoptosis in rat lungs using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After establishing sustained lung edema and eosinophilia by challenge with Sephadex beads intratracheally, budesonide treatment was started intratracheally. Sephadex alone increased the total number of apoptotic cells, which were not efficiently engulfed by macrophages or other cells, in vivo. Yet apoptotic tissue eosinophils were exceedingly rare (1 of 360 TEM-analyzed eosinophils). By contrast, approximately 20% of eosinophils in the airway lumen were apoptotic, and unengulfed. Budesonide promptly inhibited edema but 3 d of steroid treatment were required to reduce the established tissue eosinophilia. Not at any time point did budesonide induce eosinophil apoptosis (0 of 318 TEM-analyzed tissue eosinophils). We conclude that (1) eosinophil apoptosis can occur but is a rare event in vivo in respiratory tract tissues; (2) airway tissue eosinophils, rather than undergoing apoptosis, are eliminated by migration into airway lumen followed by apoptosis and mucociliary clearance; (3) anti-inflammatory steroid treatment may not increase eosinophil apoptosis in vivo nor may it affect the luminal entry of eosinophils; (4) steroids permit elimination of eosinophils into airway lumen and slowly resolve established lung eosinophilia.
Susceptibility to the arrhythmogenic action of ouabain was tested in rats with right ventricular hypertrophy, due to experimental chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, and in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats with left ventricular hypertrophy. As parameters of arrhythmogenicity the time-duration of infusion of a solution of ouabain (1 g/100 ml), at a rate of 0.7 mg/kg per minute, was measured until the appearance on the ECG of the first premature ventricular contraction, ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest. All three effects of digitalis toxicity (premature ventricular contraction, ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest) appeared significantly earlier both in rats with right ventricular hypertrophy, due to chronic experimental hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, and in SH rats with hypertrophy of the left ventricle, as compared to the infusion time of the same solution of ouabain needed to elicit the mentioned toxic effects in control rats without ventricular hypertrophy.
The immunological type of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT II) is a severe complication of heparin treatment and is associated with arterial and venous thrombosis. Only patients with absolute thrombocytopenia have prompted suspicion of HAT in clinical practice. We report on a 44-year-old male who developed thromboembolic episodes after coronary angiography such as reinfarction and thrombotic episodes of A. brachialis. Fibrinolytic therapy combined with i.v. unfractionated heparin treatment was the therapy of choice and was followed by severe further thromboembolic adverse effects. Besides an impaired fibrinolytic response and elevated antiphospholipid antibodies, we diagnosed HAT type II in HIPA and ELISA (Stago. Boehringer-Mannheim). This special patient had platelet counts within a normal range, when developing the thromboembolic episodes. It appears that the normal platelet count during the thromboembolic episodes reflect a relative thrombocytopenia. From a clinical point of view we recommend the use of a lab panel to exclude HAT type II in patients with thromboembolic episodes under therapy with fractionated or unfractionated heparin. Platelet counts within a normal range are not absolute exclusion criterion for HAT II.
Three weeks after completing a 4-pulse course of itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis, a 25-year-old woman patient developed severe liver crisis and required an emergency liver transplant. We report the case and discuss the use of itraconazole in onychomycosis and dermatomycoses.
Levosimendan is a new inodilator. Its mechanism of action includes calcium sensitization of contractile proteins and the opening of adenosine triphosphate-dependent K channels. The combination of positive inotropy with anti-ischemic effects of K-channel opening offers potential benefits in comparison with currently available intravenous inotropes, which are contraindicated in patients with ongoing myocardial ischemia. Levosimendan has been extensively studied in various animal models of heart failure, in which the drug has increased contractility without adverse effects on diastolic function. These results have been repeated in patients with heart failure, in whom levosimendan dose-dependently increases cardiac output and reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The active metabolite of levosimendan (OR-1896) significantly prolongs the duration of the hemodynamic effects of the therapeutic 24-hour levosimendan infusion. Levosimendan has been studied in two major trials with decompensated patients (LIDO and RUSSLAN), in which it showed outcome benefits in comparison with dobutamine and placebo, respectively. A third comparative study (CASINO) recently suggested mortality benefits with levosimendan over placebo and dobutamine. Currently, two large prospective trials (SURVIVE and REVIVE) in patients who are hospitalized because of worsening heart failure are underway. These trials will conclusively prove whether levosimendan should be added to the standard treatment in patients who are hospitalized because of cardiac decompensation.
Since electrophysiological correlates of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) are almost unknown, changes of striatal dopamine (DA) transmission and electrophysiological activity of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) were recorded before and after acute L-dopa administration in sham-operated and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats that were previously treated with vehicle or L-dopa for 10 days. Abnormal involuntary movements occurred only in the L-dopa-primed 6-OHDA-lesioned rats that showed after acute l-dopa administration a decrease in firing rate, the highest local field potential power in the theta/alpha band, a consequent oscillatory activity in the same frequency band at the single neuron level and an excessive increase in striatal DA release associated with the lowest level of DA metabolism. These results suggest that increased synchronised afferent activity may drive SNr oscillations in the same frequency band and is associated with abnormal involuntary movements, further suggesting the potential use of desynchronising drugs for managing LID in Parkinson's disease.
Vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) is genotoxic and cancerogen agent. Individual variations in response to the exposure have been noticed and the variations may be due to genetic differences in the removal of VCM-DNA adducts, such as polymorphism in genes NER pathway and BER pathway. This study explores the relationship between genetic polymorphism of seven genes within the NER pathway (XPA, XPD, XPC, XPG, XPF, and ERCC1) and BER pathway (APE1), and susceptibility to chromosomal damage after exposure to VCM. One hundred and eighty workers occupationally exposed to VCM and 43 unexposed controls were investigated. Chromosome damage in peripheral lymphocytes was measured by the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay. PCR-RFLP technique was applied to detect polymorphisms of the seven genes. The influence of genotype, age, gender, cumulative exposure dose, alcohol consumption, and smoking status on the frequencies of MN was determined using univariate and multiple Poisson regression analyses. We found XPA A23G variant workers had significantly higher MN frequencies than those from the wild-type homozygous counterparts (P = 0.01). Those with the variant XPD Lys751Gln genotype had marginally higher MN frequencies (P = 0.07). On the other hand, XPC PAT and XPF 5'-UTR T2063A variant workers had significantly lower MN frequencies compared with those from their wild-type homozygous counterparts (P = 0.04 and P = 0.004, respectively). Our findings suggest that XPC PAT, XPD Lys751Gln, XPA A23G and XPF 5'-UTR T2063A contribute to the level of chromosome damage in occupational exposure to VCM in Chinese population.
Thyroid dysfunction is a known complication of interferon treatment in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Other uncommon endocrine complications have been reported during the treatment of viral hepatitis with IFN-alpha, such as hypopituitarism. A 54-year-old female patient with chronic hepatitis C began treatment with pegylated (PEG)-IFN-alpha 2a 180 mug/week plus ribavirin 1,000 mg/day. At week 20 of treatment, her routine laboratory control showed low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free serum thyroxine. This was confirmed at week 24, and other laboratory values showed low levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated high intensity of the anterior pituitary gland and enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium. Hypophysitis with hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and secondary or central hypothyroidism was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical features, endocrinological assessment, immunological markers and imaging studies. Twenty-four weeks after stopping treatment, HCV RNA was negative by polymerase chain reaction and alanine aminotransferase values were below the upper limits of normal, and ACTH and thyroid values remained within the reference values. This is the first report of central hypothyroidism and hypophysitis during treatment with PEG-IFN-alpha plus ribavirin, and may be included in the potential list of side effects of the combination treatment.
Studies have shown that aberrant expression of miRNAs is involved in the initiation and progression of cancer, and several miRNAs have been characterized as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Restoring the expression of tumor suppressor genes by epigenetic therapy has great potential in cancer treatment and it has been shown that some miRNAs can be directly regulated from their own promoters by epigenetic alterations in cancer cells. However, the majority of miRNAs are located within intronic regions of transcription units and it was unclear if intronic miRNAs can also be epigenetically regulated. Here we show that the tumor suppressor miR-126, which is located within an intron of the EGFL7 gene, is downregulated in cancer cell lines and in primary bladder and prostate tumors. Mature miR-126 can be generated from three different transcripts of EGFL7 with each one having its own promoter. Interestingly, miR-126 and one of the transcripts of EGFL7 that has a CpG island promoter are concomitantly upregulated in cancer cell lines by inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. These findings suggest that epigenetic changes can control the expression of tumor suppressor intronic miRNAs by directly controlling their host genes. Thus, epigenetic therapy not only directly activates miRNAs from their own promoters, but also activates intronic miRNAs together with their host genes. This reveals an additional mechanism and anticancer effect of epigenetic therapy.
A patient developed a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) many years after therapeutic cerebral radiation and methotrexate treatment for leukemia. The differential radiologic and histologic diagnoses, as well as the possible co-oncogenic effects of radiation and methotrexate, are evaluated.
The present study compared the efficacy of preloading with colloid "Haemaccel" with vasoconstrictor (intravenous ephedrine sulphate) in preventing hypotension during propofol induction. This prospective, randomized study included 120 patients of Amercan Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II ageing 21 to 50 years of both gender coming for routine surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups with 40 patients in each. Group A (control) did not receive any study medication, group B received Haemaccel (10 ml/kg intravenously over 10-15 minutes) and group C received injection ephedrine (0.2 mg/kg iv) prior to induction of anaesthesia. Propofol (2.5 mg/kg iv) was used for induction of anaesthesia. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before induction (baseline) and then every minute for 5 minutes after administering propofol. Anaesthesia was continued with standard technique thereafter. Hypotension was defined as fall in systolic blood pressure more than 20% from the basal value. The incidence of hypotension in Haemaccel (23.1%) or ephedrine group (22.5%) was significantly less than the control group (67.5%, P<0.01). We conclude that though preloading with colloid (Haemaccel) or prior injection of sympathomimetic (ephedrine) are not fully efficacious in preventing hypotension caused by propofol induction, both decrease the incidence in significant number of patients with heart rate less than baseline value in the colloid group.
To describe a case of acute hemolysis associated temporally with administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) in a patient with AIDS, review the available literature on TMP/SMX-induced hemolytic anemia, and discuss possible drug- and disease-related factors that may have contributed to the episode of hemolysis.
A precipitous decrease in red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit occurred shortly after a black woman with AIDS received a single intravenous dose of TMP/SMX for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Following drug discontinuation and repeated transfusions, the patient's hematologic indices returned to baseline.
References were obtained using MEDLINE searches, the bibliographies of articles identified during the searches, review articles, and standard textbooks.
Of the two different mechanisms of TMP/SMX-induced hemolytic anemia, the reaction is most likely to occur via dose-related oxidative disruption of the erythrocyte membrane in subpopulations deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity. In the US, G6PD deficiency most frequently is encountered among blacks. The potential for hemolysis may be further increased in G6PD-deficient AIDS patients, who also appear to lack adequate intracellular glutathione, which is essential for protecting the erythrocyte membrane from oxidative damage. Although an assay for G6PD activity was not conducted, the case circumstances were consistent with TMP/SMX-induced hemolysis in a G6PD-deficient patient.
Black patients with AIDS who are receiving relatively high (greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/d) dosages of TMP/SMX should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia.
A case of bilateral profound sensori-neural hearing loss following systemic administration of chloramphenicol is reported because of its rarity. The hearing loss was gradually progressive, involving one ear; and with a repeat course of the drug, the other ear too was involved. An idiosyncratic or allergic response to previous exposure to the drug may be the cause of the toxicity. One should be careful in prescribing the drug repeatedly; when this is done, the patient must be carefully observed for possible toxic effects.
The present study was undertaken to clarify the epileptogenic activity induced by intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) of antibiotics effective in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in chronically electrode implanted rats. Teicoplanin (10-100 microg, i.c.v.) caused dose-related electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure characterized by an uninterrupted high voltage and wave complex. At the same time, the rats showed forelimb clonus, head nodding, jumping and severe convulsion. At a high dose (100 microg, i.c.v.), the drug caused a severe twisting immediately after the intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) followed by jumping and violent convulsion with a continuous rhythmic spike and wave complex in EEG. On the other hand, vancomycin (30-1000 microg, i.c.v.) caused no or almost no epileptogenic activity in terms of behavior and in EEG. However, at a high dose (1000 microg, i.c.v.), the drug caused an occasional spike from the hippocampus without showing any behavioral changes in the rats. Fosfomycin (30-1000 microg, i.c.v.), cefazolin (10-100 microg, i.c.v.) and penicillin G (30-300 microg, i.c.v.), used as reference drugs, caused dose-dependent epileptogenic activity in both EEG. From these findings, it was found that teicoplanin caused a potent epileptogenic activity, different to vancomycin. Therefore, it can be concluded that vancomycin may be safety on epileptogenic activity used for the clinical purpose of infections caused by MRSA.
Although delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) has been widely recognized as a serious complication of red blood cell transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), there is no consensus on its optimal management. Discontinuation of transfusion is recommended, whereas corticosteroids and immunoglobulins are considered to be beneficial. We report 2 children with sickle cell anemia who were diagnosed with DHTR and experienced a subsequent neurologic event in the course of treatment with corticosteroids. The role of corticosteroids as possible precipitating factors of neurologic complications is discussed. Pending a better understanding of the chain of events of DHTR, SCD children with DHTR should receive steroids with great caution.
Neoplastic conversion induced in rat liver by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was quantified by measuring preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions over a 34 week period in the beginning of which the carcinogen was given at three dose levels and two dose rates for the first 10 weeks, after which animals were maintained for 24 weeks with either no further exposure or were fed phenobarbital (PB) to promote neoplastic development of cells converted by DEN. DEN was injected s.c. in male F344 rats at weekly or biweekly intervals for total doses of 1, 2 or 4 mmol/kg body wt and then the rats were maintained on basal diet alone or diet containing 0.05% PB. At the end of exposure, DEN had produced a dose-related decrease in centrilobular glutamine synthetase-expressing (GS+) hepatocytes which is indicative of mild cytotoxicity. All doses induced foci that were gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive and iron storage-deficient. The multiplicity of foci in the middle dose exceeded that in the low dose by about a factor of two and, in the high dose, was > 10-fold greater. A few GS+ foci were found in the high dose group only. At 34 weeks, neoplasms were present in the middle and high dose groups. Administration of PB after DEN increased the multiplicity of foci in all dose groups, most substantially in the low dose group. The effect of PB on liver neoplasm yield was marginal in the low non-carcinogenic dose, whereas it enhanced the multiplicity in the weakly carcinogenic middle dose by approximately 10-fold. Four principal findings were made: (i) even at the low doses used, a mild cytotoxic response not evidenced by morphological changes in conventional histopathology was manifested in the GS+ centrilobular subpopulation of hepatocytes; (ii) the dose response over a 4-fold dose range of DEN alone and when followed by PB was non-linear; (iii) the precursor role of foci in the evolution of liver neoplasms was evident and was most conspicuous in the case of GS+ foci; and (iv) a high level of foci induction was required for the evolution of neoplasms, even with PB promotion. The finding of non-linearity with increasing doses of DEN raises questions about the assumption that effects of carcinogens at high doses can be quantitatively extrapolated to low doses.
Mercury is an immunotoxic metal that induces autoimmune disease in rodents. Highly susceptible mouse strains such as SJL/N, A.SW, B10.S (H-2s) develop multiple autoimmune manifestations after exposure to inorganic mercury, including lymphoproliferation, elevated levels of autoantibodies, overproduction of IgG and IgE, and circulating immune complexes in kidney and vasculature. A few studies have examined relationships between mercury exposures and adverse immunological reactions in humans, but there is little evidence of mercury-associated autoimmunity in humans.
To test the immunotoxic effects of mercury in humans, we studied communities in Amazonian Brazil with well-characterized exposures to mercury. Information was collected on diet, mercury exposures, demographic data, and medical history. Antinuclear and antinucleolar autoantibodies (ANA and ANoA) were measured by indirect immunofluorescence. Anti-fibrillarin autoantibodies (AFA) were measured by immunoblotting.
In a gold mining site, there was a high prevalence of ANA and ANoA: 40.8% with detectable ANoA at > or =1:10 serum dilution, and 54.1% with detectable ANA (of which 15% had also detectable ANoA). In a riverine town, where the population is exposed to methylmercury by fish consumption, both prevalence and levels of autoantibodies were lower: 18% with detectable ANoA and 10.7% with detectable ANA. In a reference site with lower mercury exposures, both prevalence and levels of autoantibodies were much lower: only 2.0% detectable ANoA, and only 7.1% with detectable ANA. In the gold mining population, we also examined serum for AFA in those subjects with detectable ANoA (> or =1:10). There was no evidence for mercury induction of this autoantibody.
This is the first study to report immunologic changes, indicative of autoimmune dysfunction in persons exposed to mercury, which may also reflect interactions with infectious disease and other factors.
To examine the dosing of memantine in patients with dementia admitted to an inpatient geriatric psychiatry ward and review the published literature regarding the pharmacologic and clinical need to dose adjust memantine.
A retrospective study was conducted involving patients, admitted over a 2-year-period, with a diagnosis of dementia and receiving memantine. Published clinical trials, pharmacokinetic studies, and clinical trial registry data were used to investigate relationships among dose, efficacy, and side effects.
Of the 70 patients comprising the study sample, 27% were not prescribed appropriate doses of memantine at the time of admission. Notably, 60% of those patients who should had memantine renally dose-adjusted were not prescribed the adjusted dose. Trial and pharmacokinetic data support the need to renally adjust memantine.
Appropriate dosing of memantine in patients with dementia is important in an effort to maximize the medication's safety and efficacy.
A 10-year-old boy with osteosarcoma and normal renal function manifested laboratory evidence of impending renal toxicity and extreme elevation of aspartate aminotrasferase and alanine aminotransferase within 2 hours after the completion of a 4-hour infusion of high-dose methotrexate (MTX) (12 g/m2), and went on to develop acute renal failure with life-threatening hyperkalemia 29 hours later. Although his renal function recovered completely with high-dose leucovorin, hemodialysis, charcoal hemoperfusion, and carboxypeptidase G2, we present this case to emphasize that signs of renal toxicity may be present as early as 2 hours after the completion of a 4-hour MTX infusion, and to suggest that monitoring for MTX toxicity should perhaps begin within a few hours after the completion of 4-hour MTX infusion.
Oxidative stress, altered glutathione levels, and hyperhomocysteinemia play critical roles in Alzheimer's disease. We studied the relationships between hyperhomocysteinemia, glutathione, and oxidative stress in TgCRND8 mice maintained in conditions of folate, B12, and B6 deficiency and the effect of S-adenosylmethionine supplementation. We found that hyperhomocysteinemia was correlated with increased reduced/oxidized brain glutathione ratio, with decreased glutathione S-transferase activity and increased lipid peroxidation. S-adenosylmethionine potentiated superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase activity and restored altered brain glutathione and erythrocytes lipid peroxidation. These results underline the importance of S-adenosylmethionine as neuroprotective compound, acting both on methylation and oxidation metabolism.
Gene expression profiling of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) joint tissue samples provides a unique insight into the gene signatures involved in disease development and progression. Fibroblast-like synovial (FLS) cells were obtained from RA, OA and control trauma joint tissues (non-RA, non-OA) and RNA was analyzed by Affymetrix microarray. Thirty-four genes specific to RA and OA FLS cells were identified (P<0.05). HOXD10, HOXD11, HOXD13, CCL8 and LIM homeobox 2 were highly and exclusively expressed in RA and CLU, sarcoglycan-gamma, GPR64, POU3F3, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-gamma and tripartite motif-containing 2 were expressed only in OA. The data also revealed expression heterogeneity for patients with the same disease. To address disease heterogeneity in RA FLS cells, we examined the effects of clinical disease parameters (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF)) and drug therapies (methotrexate/prednisone) on RA FLS cell gene expression. Eight specific and unique correlations were identified: human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQA2 with HAQ score; Clec12A with RF; MAB21L2, SIAT7E, HAPLN1 and BAIAP2L1 with CRP level; RGMB and OSAP with ESR. Signature RA FLS cell gene expression profiles may provide insights into disease pathogenesis and have utility in diagnosis, prognosis and drug responsiveness.
We report two cases of cytarabine (Ara-C) induced pericarditis. The first patient was a 61-year-old man with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with trilineage myelodysplasia (M2). Fever and pericardial effusion developed after treatment with low-dose Ara-C and etoposide (VP16) during the patient's second leukemic relapse. The second patient was a 65-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transformed into AML (M2). He achieved a complete remission after treatment with low-dose Ara-C and VP16. However, during consolidation chemotherapy consisting of oral cytarabine ocfosfate and VP16, fever and pericardial effusion developed. In both cases, pericardiocentesis revealed exudative effusion with many neutrophils. Neither bacterial nor fungal infection was demonstrated. Chest symptoms and fever were resolved by methylprednisolone pulse therapy and pericardial drainage. Both patients were given a diagnosis of pericarditis caused by allergic reaction to Ara-C. We also report on 6 other patients with Ara-C syndrome who have been encountered by our hospital.
Dicumarol is a naturally occurring anticoagulant derived from coumarin that induces cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in human pancreatic cancer cells (Cullen, J. J., Hinkhouse, M. M., Grady, M., Gaut, A. W., Liu, J., Zhang, Y., Weydert, C. J. D., Domann, F. E., and Oberley, L. W. (2003) Cancer Res. 63, 5513-5520). Although dicumarol has been used as an inhibitor of the two-electron reductase NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), dicumarol is also thought to affect quinone-mediated electron transfer reactions in the mitochondria, leading to the production of superoxide (O2*-) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). We hypothesized that mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species mediates the increased susceptibility of pancreatic cancer cells to dicumarol-induced metabolic oxidative stress. Dicumarol decreased clonogenic survival equally in both MDA-MB-468 NQO1(-) and MDA-MB-468 NQO1+ breast cancer cells. Dicumarol decreased clonogenic survival in the transformed fibroblast cell line IMRSV-90 compared with the IMR-90 cell line. Dicumarol, with the addition of mitochondrial electron transport chain blockers, decreased clonogenic cell survival in human pancreatic cancer cells and increased superoxide levels. Dicumarol with the mitochondrial electron transport chain blocker antimycin A decreased clonogenic survival and increased superoxide levels in cells with functional mitochondria but had little effect on cancer cells without functional mitochondria. Overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase and mitochondrial-targeted catalase with adenoviral vectors reversed the dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity and reversed fluorescence of the oxidation-sensitive probe. We conclude mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species mediates the increased susceptibility of cancer cells to dicumarol-induced cytotoxicity.
This study is to explore whether the protective effect of resveratrol on ischemia-reperfusion injury is correlated with the structural and functional association between M3 receptor (M3 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor) and Cx43 (connexin 43 gap junction proteins). Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were applied to investigate whether resveratrol has an effect on structural and functional association between M3 and Cx43. The effect of resveratrol on electrocardiogram Lead II ex vivo in rats, SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity and MDA (malondialdehyde) content was also observed in order to evaluate the protective effect of resveratrol on ischemia-reperfusion injury. Resveratrol could restore the structural and functional association between M3 receptor and Cx43 gap junction proteins that was partially destroyed under ischemia-reperfusion injury. The phosphorylation and spatial distribution disturbances in Cx43 expression caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury were also restored. Also, the QRS duration, SOD activity and MDA content were restored. Resveratrol could restore the structural and functional association between M3 receptor and Cx43 gap junction proteins.
