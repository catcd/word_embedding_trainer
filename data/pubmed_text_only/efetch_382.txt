Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motoneurons (MNs) in the spinal cord, brainstem and motor cortex, causing progressive paralysis and death. Nowadays, there is no effective therapy and most patients die 2-5 years after diagnosis. Sigma-1R is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in the CNS and specially enriched in MNs. Mutations on the Sigma-1R leading to frontotemporal lobar degeneration-ALS were recently described in human patients. We previously reported the therapeutic role of the selective sigma-1R agonist 2-(4-morpholi-nethyl)1-phenylcyclohexanecarboxylate (PRE-084) in SOD1G93A ALS mice, that promoted spinal MN preservation and extended animal survival by controlling NMDA receptor calcium influx. Resveratrol (RSV, trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol with promising neuroprotective effects. We recently found that RSV administration to SOD1G93A mice preserves spinal MN function and increases mice survival. These beneficial effects were associated to activation of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways, leading to the modulation of autophagy and an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. The main goal of this work was to assess the effect of combined RSV and PRE-084 administration in SOD1G93A ALS mice.
We determined the locomotor performance of the animals by rotarod test and evaluated spinal motoneuron function using electrophysiological tests.
RSV plus PRE-084 treatment from 8 weeks of age significantly improved locomotor performance and spinal MN function, accompanied by a significant reduction of MN degeneration and an extension of mice lifespan. In agreement with our previous findings, there was an induction of PKC-specific phosphorylation of the NMDA-NR1 subunit and an increased expression and activation of Sirt1 and AMPK in the ventral spinal cord of treated SOD1G93A animals.
Although combined PRE and RSV treatment significantly ameliorated SOD1G93A mice, it did not show a synergistic effect compared to RSV-only and PRE-084-only treated groups.
Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), an enzyme that cleaves inflammatory bioactive peptides, may play a protective role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, its low extracellular activity hinders the precise measurement of changes that take place during ALI/ARDS. The main objective of this study was to clarify the regulation of NEP activity and its expression during ALI/ARDS.
In a clinical study, we measured plasma NEP activity in patients who developed postoperative ALI/ARDS, using a HPLC fluorometric system. In an experimental study, we induced ALI by intratracheal instillation of hydrochloric acid (HCl) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice, and similarly measured NEP activity in plasma, lung tissue, and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We also studied the distribution and measured the amounts of NEP protein, using immuno-histochemical and immunoblot analyses, and measured the levels of NEP mRNA, using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, in the lungs of mice with ALI.
The plasma NEP activity was significantly lower in patients presenting with ALI/ARDS than in controls. Similarly, the NEP activity in plasma and lung tissue was markedly lower, and lung injuries more severe in LPS- than in HCl-treated mice. In contrast, the activity of NEP in the BALF of LPS-treated mice was increased. The intratracheal instillation of LPS decreased the gene expression of NEP in the lung. Immuno-histochemical and Western immunoblot studies in mice confirmed a) the presence of NEP in the alveolar wall, a critical target in ALI/ARDS, and b) a decrease in its expression in HCl- and LPS-induced ALI.
In this experimental and clinical study of ALI/ARDS, the activity of NEP was significantly decreased in plasma and increased in the alveolar air space.
Early adverse experiences resulting from maternal separation may lead to neuronal cell death and eventually cause memory impairment. Maternal separation has been used to create a valid animal model of early life stress and a depression-like syndrome. The phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitor, tadalafil (Cialis), is a widely prescribed agent for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the effects of tadalafil on apoptosis and cell proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of rat pups following maternal separation. Specifically, the immobility time in the forced swim test was increased in the maternal-separated rat pups, and tadalafil treatment decreased the immobility time. The rat pups in the maternal separation group had deceased memory function compared to the rat pups in the maternal care group, and tadalafil treatment increased memory function of the rat pups in the maternal separation group. Apoptotic cell death in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was significantly increased in the maternal-separated rat pups, and tadalafil treatment suppressed maternal separation-induced apoptosis. In contrast, cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus was significantly decreased in the maternal-separated rat pups, and taldalafil treatment increased cell proliferation. The present results suggest that tadalafil improves depressive symptoms and alleviates memory impairment by suppressing apoptotic neuronal cell death and enhancing cell proliferation in maternal-separated rat pups.
A 30 year old man with metastatic embryonal carcinoma became hypertensive during vinblastine, bleomycin, and cisplatin therapy. Three months after completion of therapy, accelerated hypertension occurred (blood pressure 210/140 mm Hg). Nitroprusside failed to control the hypertension, but captopril resulted in a prompt and sustained normalization of the blood pressure. The plasma renin activity was markedly elevated before therapy. Renal biopsy disclosed "onionskin" narrowing of the interlobular arteries and fibrin thrombosis of a majority of the afferent arterioles. A form of drug-induced renovascular hypertension is suggested.
Drug-induced liver disease (DILD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality and impair new drug development. Mounting evidence suggests that DILD is a complex, multifactorial disease in which no one factor is likely to be an absolute indicator of susceptibility. As an approach to better understand the multifactorial basis of DILD, we recently compared the hepatic proteomes of mice that were resistant (SJL) and susceptible (C57Bl/6) to APAP-induced liver disease (AILD) wherein we identified potential risk factors and mechanistic pathways responsible for DILD. In this study, we have uncovered additional potential risk factors by comparing hepatic mRNA expression profiles of the same two strains of mice with that of SJLxB6-F1 hybrid (F1) mice, which were found to be of intermediate susceptibility to AILD. Global hepatic gene expression profiling over a 24 h period following APAP treatment revealed elevated patterns in the mRNA expression of cytoprotective genes in resistant SJL mice as compared to susceptible B6 mice, while F1 mice had intermediate mRNA expression levels of these genes. One of these genes encoded for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 whose relative protein expression among the three strains of mice was found to parallel that of their mRNA levels, suggesting that this protein had a protective role against AILD. However, there was no difference in the susceptibility of HSP70 knockout (KO) mice to AILD as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. There were also protoxicant genes, such as osteopontin (OPN), with elevated mRNA expression levels in the B6 mice as compared to the SJL mice and with intermediate levels in the F1 mice, suggesting that they may play a role in exacerbating liver injury after APAP treatment. In support of this hypothesis, OPN KO mice were found to be more resistant to AILD than WT mice. Additionally, the results from both the proteomic and the genomic studies were compared. The two approaches were found to be complementary to each other and not simply overlapping. Our findings suggest that comparative gene expression analysis of susceptible and resistant mouse strains may lead to the identification of factors that could have a role in determining the susceptibility of individuals to DILD.
A series of 1,3-disubstituted 2,4(1H,3H)-quinazolinediones was prepared from the 3-substituted 2,4(1H,3H)-quinazolinediones by treatment with sodium hydride and the desired alkyl halide in xylene. These compounds showed varying degrees of vasodilation and antihypertensive activity without significant blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors. 1-[3-(N,N-Dimethylamino)propyl]-3-[3-(4-phenyl1-piperazinyl)propyl]-2,4(1H,3H)-quinazolinedione, which was selected for further studies, was more potent than papaverine in inducing vasodilation and induced a prolonged decrease in systolic blood pressure of hypertensive rats upon oral administration.
Musculoskeletal pains are often characterised by referred pain and hyperalgesia. The aim of the present study was to examine the sensitivity to pressure and pinprick at sites ipsi- and contralateral to capsaicin-induced pain in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the sensation to sub- and supra-pain threshold stimuli by pressure and pinprick were recorded before, during and after experimental muscle pain. It was found that pressure stimulation (120% of baseline pain threshold) delivered over the ipsilateral deep peroneal nerve between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones showed a significant increase in VAS scores during muscle pain. The referred pain did not overlap this hyperalgesic site. Ipsilateral test sites at the TA muscle, great toe and between the 3rd and 4th metatarsal bones did not show any changes in response to pressure stimulation during pain. In contrast, test sites at the ipsilateral ankle showed hypoalgesia to pressure during muscle pain. In the contralateral leg hypoalgesia to pressure was found at all sites during pain. The decreased sensitivity to pressure was confirmed with both sub- and supra-pressure pain-threshold stimuli. VAS scores to pinprick were either decreased or unchanged during pain compared to before pain. Naloxone administrated in a placebo-controlled manner had no effect on hypoalgesia to pressure or pinprick during muscle pain. Thus, the generalised decreased sensitivity may reflect activation of non-opioid endogenous pain inhibitory systems. The lack of change in sensitivity at some sites could indicate a competitive balance between excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. The deep peroneal nerve specifically innervates both the TA muscle and the only site of hyperalgesia indicating spatial summation of afferent activity from these structures.
Carvedilol (20 mg/kg, bid) or vehicle was given to rats surviving a myocardial infarction (MI) 24 h (n = 409). In rats with large MI, carvedilol partially preserved left ventricular (LV) function and intrinsic myocardial contractility and reactivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Carvedilol led to scar thickening, increased LV hypertrophy, and decreased cardiac fibrosis but did not prevent LV dilatation. Carvedilol reduced cardiac expression of interleukin-1beta but did not prevent cardiac fetal gene re-expression or modify cardiac oxidative stress. Despite these beneficial effects, carvedilol decreased survival (38.8%, versus vehicle, 50.6%) due to excessive early mortality. Thus, post-MI carvedilol has many beneficial effects, however, in this study it increased post-MI mortality, perhaps due to excessive hypotension.
Brugada syndrome is an arrhythmogenetic disease characterized by electrocardiographic ST segment elevation in right precordial leads, which is called "coved type", and an increased risk of sudden death as the result of ventricular fibrillation. We presented a case of Brugada syndrome with a convulsive seizure, during administration of a tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of a depressive state. A 43-year-old man with bipolar II disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of a depressive state. There was no medical history of heart failure. Nortriptyline was effective for his depressive as well as for obsessive symptoms. During the treatment, however, he presented a convulsive syncope. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed "coved type" ST segment elevation, and the patient consulted a cardiologist. Electrophysiological study revealed Brugada syndrome, and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed. An overdose of antidepressants has been reported to produce a Brugada-type ECG because of its Na channel antagonism. However, in the present case, the abnormal ECG findings occurred following a usual dosage of nortriptyline. Thus, it is suggested that Brugada syndrome is related to a susceptibility to antidepressants in the present case. Every psychiatrist managing antidepressant therapy should be aware of Brugada syndrome and this ECG pattern, which may be a marker of sudden death.
To elucidate the dose-effect relationship of neurotoxicity of allyl chloride (AC) in Donryu rats, 5 animals each were exposed to 10, 50 and 100 ppm AC for 8 h/d and 5 d/wk for a period of 34 wk. Nerve conduction velocities of the tail nerve in rats were determined before and after 4, 8, 12, 16, 22, 28 and 34 wk of exposure, and the width of landing foot-spread after 8, 12, 16, 28 and 34 wk. Animals subjected to 100 ppm AC showed significant (p less than 0.01) reduction of motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities and nerve action potentials (NAP) after 28 wk when clinical signs of neuropathy were observed, i.e., weakness of hindlimbs and significantly (p less than 0.01) extended landing foot-spreads. Motor distal latency was retarded in rats exposed to 100 ppm AC at the last period of exposure. In rats exposed to 50 and 100 ppm AC, no remarkable electrophysiological findings or abnormal clinical signs were observed except for depressed amplitude of NAP in 50 ppm-exposed rats when compared with those exposed to 10 ppm.
A dog that was treated with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine and fenbendazole developed transient aplastic anemia. The onset of bone marrow aplasia at 14 days after initiation of treatment and remission of it after cessation of treatment suggested that the aplasia was drug-induced. A hematologically normal dog treated with the same drug combination failed to develop hematologic dyscrasia. Because of the potential toxic effects of trimethoprim-sulfadiazine and/or fenbendazole, animals under treatment with this combination should be monitored by use of periodic CBC.
The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Terlipressin in the treatment of severe hypotension in cardiosurgical patients and to assess the differences between the groups of survivors and nonsurvivors.
The study population was 27 patients who developed hypotension after cardiac surgery.
All surviving patients developed refractory hypotension early after extracorporeal circulation. Of the 9 nonsurvivors, 3 also experienced postcardiotomy hypotension, while the remaining 6 developed severe hypotension during sepsis. Terlipressin given continuously significantly increased the mean arterial pressure and reduced the heart rate in both groups. Norepinephrine requirements decreased significantly among survivors only. The mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure levels remained unchanged or increased insignificantly, while several liver markers in the survivor group significantly increased.
Terlipressin given continuously is a potent vasopressor in patients with norepinephrine-resistant postcardiotomy hypotension; however, Terlipressin treatment failed in patients who developed refractory hypotension during sepsis. We cannot recommend this therapy in such patients as it proved to be hemodynamicaly ineffective and may even worsen the circulatory situation.
The optimal management of patients who have recurrent thromboembolism while being treated with oral anticoagulation therapy is unknown. This study reports managing such patients with extended duration low molecular weight heparin therapy.
This study was a retrospective review of the prospective databases of three tertiary care teaching hospitals over a 27-month period. All patients who had recurrent symptomatic thromboembolism while being treated with warfarin were identified. All patients were treated with low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin), 200 U/kg daily. Data were collected for recurrent venous thromboembolism, bleeding, and survival.
Eight hundred eighty-seven patients were managed for acute thromboembolism. In 32 patients, symptomatic, objectively documented thromboembolism recurred while they were taking warfarin; 63% of the patients with recurrence had cancer, compared with 30% of patients without recurrence. All recurrences were treated with dalteparin. In 3 patients (9% [95% confidence interval: 2% to 25%]), symptomatic recurrence developed while they were being treated with low molecular weight heparin. Nineteen patients (59%) died while receiving anticoagulation therapy; all deaths but 1 were due to malignancy, and none was due to pulmonary embolism or bleeding.
These results suggest that recurrent venous thromboembolism is more likely to develop in cancer patients while being treated with warfarin and that long-term therapy with low molecular weight heparin may be effective in managing warfarin-failure thromboembolic disease.
To determine the antenatal risk factors associated with neonatal lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV).
Women in preterm labor were randomized to magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), other tocolytic, or saline control. The surviving babies underwent head ultrasounds (HUS) (weeks of life 1, 2, and 4) and periodic developmental examinations (months 4, 8, 12, and 18).
Of 140 infants, 17.1% (24) had neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and 10.0% (14) had LSV (half of the latter (7 of 14) had both IVH and LSV). In a regression model in which other risk factors were controlled for, the association between antenatal exposures to tocolytic MgSO4 >or=50 g and LSV were significant (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 8.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5 to 45.0; p=0.01).
Based on our data and their analyses, we infer that antenatal exposure to high-dosage, tocolytic MgSO4 may be associated with LSV.
A case of retinoic acid embryopathy which was retrospectively diagnosed after delivery is presented. The affected fetus was exposed to the drug during the first month of pregnancy and second-trimester sonographic examination showed hydrocephalus and cardiac malformation. The diagnosis was made on the basis of autopsy findings and genetic enquiry.
A 26-yr-old woman with type 1 diabetes and severe symptomatic autonomic neuropathy was treated with the long-acting somatostatin analogue Sandostatin LAR for intractable diarrhea. Her diarrhea had previously been successfully managed with three daily injections of octreotide without adverse consequences. She was given a single dose of Sandostatin LAR and within 2 weeks reported the development of increasingly frequent and severe headaches. Three weeks after the injection, she was admitted to hospital with severe hypertension, which eventually resolved with the administration of antihypertensive agents. No other underlying cause of the hypertension was discovered. Rechallenge of the patient with octreotide resulted in a transient hypertensive episode, which lasted 3 h. Severe hypertension, therefore, seems to be a possible adverse effect of treatment of diabetic diarrhea with somatostatin analogues, which should be used with great caution in subjects with severe autonomic dysfunction.
Narcolepsy causes dramatic behavioral alterations in both humans and dogs, with excessive sleepiness and cataplexy triggered by emotional stimuli. Deficiencies in the hypocretin system are well established as the origin of the condition; both from studies in humans who lack the hypocretin ligand (HCRT) and in dogs with a mutation in hypocretin receptor 2 (HCRTR2). However, little is known about molecular alterations downstream of the hypocretin signals.
By using microarray technology we have screened the expression of 29760 genes in the brains of Doberman dogs with a heritable form of narcolepsy (homozygous for the canarc-1 [HCRTR-2-2] mutation), and their unaffected heterozygous siblings. We identified two neuropeptide precursor molecules, Tachykinin precursor 1 (TAC1) and Proenkephalin (PENK), that together with Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), showed reduced expression in narcoleptic brains. The difference was particularly pronounced in the amygdala, where mRNA levels of PENK were 6.2 fold lower in narcoleptic dogs than in heterozygous siblings, and TAC1 and SOCS2 showed 4.4 fold and 2.8 fold decrease in expression, respectively. The results obtained from microarray experiments were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Interestingly, it was previously shown that a single dose of amphetamine-like stimulants able to increase wakefulness in the dogs, also produce an increase in the expression of both TAC1 and PENK in mice.
These results suggest that TAC1, PENK and SOCS2 might be intimately connected with the excessive daytime sleepiness not only in dogs, but also in other species, possibly including humans.
Sympathetic hyperactivity and hypertension caused by chronic treatment with ouabain or sodium-rich artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) can be prevented by central administration of an angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker. In the present study, we assessed whether, in Wistar rats, chronic peripheral treatment with the AT(1) receptor blockers losartan and embusartan can exert sufficient central effects to prevent these central effects of ouabain and sodium. Losartan or embusartan (both at 100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) were given subcutaneously once daily. Ouabain (50 microg/day) was infused subcutaneously, and sodium-rich aCSF (1.2 M Na(+), 5 microl/h) was infused intracerebroventricularly, both by osmotic minipump for 13-14 days. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) at rest and in response to air stress and intracerebroventricularly injection of guanabenz (75 microg/7.5 microl), ANG II (30 ng/3 microl), and ouabain (0.5 microg/2 microl) were then measured. In control rats, chronic treatment with ouabain subcutaneously and hypertonic saline intracerebroventricularly both increased baseline MAP by 20-25 mmHg and enhanced twofold the pressor responses to air stress and depressor responses to the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist guanabenz. Simultaneous treatment with losartan or embusartan fully prevented hypertension, maintained normal responses to air stress and guanabenz, and attenuated pressor responses to acute intracerebroventricular injection of ANG II and ouabain. We concluded that peripheral administration of losartan as well as embusartan can cause sufficient central effects to prevent the sympathetic hyperactivity and hypertension induced by chronic peripheral ouabain and central sodium.
Five patients, four of them children, had acute liver disease after treatment with sodium valproate. Three died. The liver disease began 3-6 months after the start of treatment and was often associated with other side-effects of sodium valproate such as thrombocytopenia and hair loss.
It is the purpose of this paper to show a concept of non-invasive assessment of cardiomyopathy (CM) in cytostatic treatment, especially with Docorubicin (A). In a follow-up study during therapy with A 150 patients were examined by ECG (QRS-amplitude), by systolic time intervals (STI), preejection period versus left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET), normal value greater than or equal to 0.45, and PEP corrected to 0-frequency (PEPc), normal value greater than or equal to 147 ms, by echocardiography (UCG), shortening fractions (SF), normal value greater than 30%, and in 6 cases by micro-catheter with exercise test.
(1) ECG does not predict CM (2) 11 patients (7%) had abnormal SF in UCG, 5 having symptoms of CM. 6 patients without clinical signs of CM were examined by microcatheter, 5 having abnormal pressure or HbO2 in the pulmonary artery at exercise. So nearly all patients with abnormal SF had objective signs of latent or overt CM (3) PEP/LVET was abnormal in all patients with CM but false positive in 44% of all investigations, mostly by shortening of LVET. PEPc, also abnormal in all patients with CM, was false positive only in 12%.
UCG is the most specific non-invasive method for assessment of CM in cytostatic treatment. STI are less specific but highly sensitive to CM and therefore a useful screening method. PEPc allows better selection than PEP/LVET because of its higher specificity. STI- contrary to UCG- can easily be obtained outside cardiologic centers, i.e. in the oncologic department itself, so that UCG is needed only in about 15-20% in treatment of patients. Cardiotoxic treatment should be stopped, when all values are abnormal, even when patients are asymptomatic. Since we adopted this policy we did not loose any of our last 100 patients from CM.
Polycystic ovaries and menstrual disturbances seem to be common among women taking valproate for epilepsy. The purpose of the present study was to assess the frequency of valproate-related metabolic and endocrine disorders in different groups of women with epilepsy.
Seventy-two women with epilepsy and 52 control subjects from centers in three European countries (Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands) participated in the study. Thirty-seven of the women with epilepsy were taking valproate monotherapy and 35 carbamazepine monotherapy.
The frequency of polycystic ovaries or hyperandrogenism, or both, among valproate-treated women with epilepsy was 70% (26 of 37) compared with 19% (10 of 52) among control subjects (P <0.001). They were found in 79% (11 of 14) of obese and 65% (15 of 23) of lean women on valproate, and in 20% (7 of 35) of carbamazepine-treated women. The obese valproate-treated women with polycystic ovaries or hyperandrogenism, or both, had hyperinsulinemia and associated unfavorable changes in serum lipid levels consistent with insulin resistance.
Polycystic ovaries and related hyperandrogenism are frequently encountered in both obese and lean women taking valproate for epilepsy. The use of valproate is associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease in obese women.
The potential hazards of abrupt withdrawal of propranolol have been described in patients with angina pectoris; however, the effects of abrupt withdrawal from long-term therapy with verapamil have not previously been investigated. The comparative effects of withdrawal from long-term treatment with propranolol and verapamil were assessed in a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized crossover study of 20 patients received placebo for 2 weeks, then increasing doses of propranolol (60 to 320 mg/day) or verapamil (240 to 480 mg/day) for 3 weeks. Patients were then abruptly withdrawn from drug onto placebo for 1 week, followed by crossover to the other drug treatment and a second withdrawal period. All 20 patients were withdrawn from verapamil without evidence of a rebound increase in frequency of anginal attacks, blood pressure, heart rate, or rate-pressure product and without a rebound deterioration in exercise tolerance. In contrast, with propranolol withdrawal, 2 patients (with the highest baseline angina attack rate) had a severe exacerbation of their anginal syndrome and could not undergo formal exercise testing; the other 18 patients were withdrawn from propranolol without incident. Plasma catecholamines were increased during exercise compared with rest during all treatments; however, the levels of catecholamines during exercise were significantly higher with propranolol than with verapamil and placebo (p less than 0.05). Levels of exercise catecholamines returned to placebo baseline values after withdrawal of propranolol.
The aim of this study was to compare the properties of the nociceptive system in eight migraine without aura patients in the pain-free phase with 10 healthy controls, by evaluating the topography and the source of the CO2 laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) obtained by the right supraorbital skin, during and after capsaicin topical application. In healthy subjects the acute cutaneous pain induced by capsaicin reduced the amplitude of the vertex LEPs and induced a posterior shifting of the P2 wave dipolar source within the anterior cingulate cortex. These functional changes seemed significantly reduced in migraine patients, for a disturbed pattern of pain modulation at the cortical level, which may subtend the onset and persistence of migraine.
Mallory-Denk bodies (MDB) are hepatocyte inclusions containing cytokeratin 8 (CK8) which can develop, along with other steatohepatitis lesions, in patients treated with amiodarone, perhexiline maleate or 4,4'-diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol. These drugs accumulate lipids, whose subsequent peroxidation liberates reactive by-products, like malondialdehyde (MDA). The formation of MDB has been previously reproduced by 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine or griseofulvin administration which cross-link CK8 by tissue transglutaminase, thus forming an entangled network, from which MDB progressively arise. The present study depicts the mechanisms initiating MDB formation by steatohepatitis-inducing drugs. Short incubation of hepatocytes with amiodarone (50 microM), 4,4'-diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol (50 microM) or perhexiline maleate (25 microM) increased the pool of CK8 monomers and increased cell calcium to activate Ca(++)-dependent transglutaminases which cross-linked the CK8 monomers into CK8-containing oligomers. The present study also provides the first evidence that MDA might directly participate in MDB formation, as this reactive agent cross-linked purified CK8 or albumin in vitro, disrupted the cytokeratin network of isolated hepatocytes, and bridged CK8 molecules. In conclusion, steatohepatitis-inducing drugs increase cell calcium and activate tissue transglutaminase, which cross-links CK8 to form a molecular scaffold, from which MDB might secondarily arise. Malondialdehyde also cross-links CK8, albeit through a different mechanism, and might also contribute to MDB formation.
A HIV infected patient was treated for stage IVB Hodgkin's lymphoma by ABVD (doxorubicine, bleomycine, vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy and lopinavir-ritonavir based antiretroviral therapy inducing profound life-threatening neutropenia. Vinblastine and lopinavir-ritonavir interaction was managed with lopinavir-ritonavir interruption around chemotherapy administration, with complete remission and immunovirological success after six cycles. This unrecorded strategy is discussed.
Adefovir dipivoxil (adefovir) effectively inhibits both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. The development of adefovir resistance is both delayed and infrequent compared with lamivudine resistance. The aim of this study was to characterize the serologic, biochemical, and virologic response to adefovir, and to explore the factors affecting initial virologic response (IVR, defined as a decrease in serum HBV below 4 log10copies/mL after 6 month of treatment) and adefovir resistance in lamivudine resistant HBV-infected patients.
This study population comprised 76 patients with lamivudine-resistance who had received adefovir for more than 12 months between March 2004 and December 2006. The adefovir-resistant mutant was assayed at 6 months and 12 months during adefovir administration. Restriction-fragment mass polymorphism analysis was used for detecting YMDD and adefovir mutants.
After adefovir administration, an IVR was observed in 31% of the patients with lamivudine resistance. Factors associated with an IVR were HBeAg negativity (P=0.04) and the presence of liver cirrhosis (P=0.04). Age, sex, pretreatment levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, pretreatment HBV DNA levels, presence of precore mutation, and type of YMDD mutants were not related to an IVR during adefovir treatment. The prevalence of adefovir resistance was 5% and 13% at 6 months and 12 months after therapy, respectively. Mixed infection of the precore mutant was a risk factors for the emergence of adefovir resistance (P=0.01).
Lamivudine-resistant HBV patients exhibiting HBeAg negativity and liver cirrhosis were more likely to achieve an IVR after adefovir therapy. Adefovir resistance was associated with mixed infection of the precore mutant.
Cholecystokinin type B (CCK(B)) receptor agonists such as pentagastrin or CCK-4 have panic-like anxiogenic effects in humans. It has also been shown that CCK-4 can stimulate insulin release and thus C-peptide release from pancreatic islet cells. Combined, these mechanisms may provide a basis for a bioassay.
Our aim was to study if a pentagastrin bolus injection evokes insulin release (as measured by C-peptide) and if the levels of C-peptide correlate to the anxiogenic effect of pentagastrin.
Pentagastrin was given in bolus IV injections to healthy volunteers at increasing doses (0.003, 0.012, 0.05 and 0.2 microg/kg).
A significant increase in the plasma level of C-peptide was observed 2-4 min after the highest dose of pentagastrin. This increase was accompanied by a transient panic-like anxiety within 2 min following pentagastrin, measured using a state anxiety scale. Also, 0.05 microg/kg pentagastrin gave a minor but significant subjective discomfort at the same time interval. The basal plasma level of C-peptide preceding the pentagastrin injection showed a positive correlation to the intensity of the subsequent pentagastrin-induced panic-like anxiety as rated on the state anxiety scale. In addition, basal plasma levels of cortisol were positively correlated to the subsequent pentagastrin-induced increase in plasma C-peptide levels.
Our results imply a possible relationship between insulin/C-peptide release and sensitivity to psychotropic activation by CCK(B) receptor stimulation. Furthermore, we postulate that both basal and pentagastrin-induced plasma levels of C-peptide may possess characteristic phenotype properties for anxiety related traits.
A 62-year-old man with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was given sublingual nifedipine, 10 mg, during invasive hemodynamic monitoring. After 15 minutes, his left ventricular outflow gradient increased from 22 to 80 mm Hg while arterial pressure fell from 152/70 to 122/64 mm Hg. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased from 15 to 22 mm Hg. These adverse hemodynamic responses may have been a result of vasodilation of the peripheral circulation induced by nifedipine. Thus, some patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may develop serious hemodynamic compromise when treated with nifedipine.
