The genetic basis of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), also known as Job syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency associated with recurrent skin and pulmonary infections, is unknown. We hypothesized that HIES is due to a defect in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. We used a whole blood cytokine assay to compare inflammatory responses to stimulation with specific Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway agonists in four individuals with HIES and nine healthy controls. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-12 was not impaired in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, zymosan, lipoteichoic acid, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interferon (IFN)-gamma was reduced in HIES subjects in response to each of these stimuli. We sequenced several candidate genes from the TLR pathway in HIES individuals to determine whether any mutations were associated with this syndrome. No novel mutations or polymorphisms were found in the coding regions of TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, MyD88, or TRAF6. In summary, although HIES individuals had an IFN-gamma secretion defect, they also produced normal levels of several TLR-regulated proinflammatory cytokines. No unique mutations or polymorphisms were observed in several candidate genes from the TLR pathway. Our studies do not support a role for a defective TLR response in HIES individuals.
ABCA1 protects against atherosclerosis by facilitating cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells in the arterial wall to extracellular apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. In contrast to apoA-I, apoE is secreted by macrophages and can, like apoA-I, induce ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Yet, the combined effect of macrophage ABCA1 and apoE on lesion development is unexplored.
LDL receptor knockout (KO) mice were transplanted with bone marrow from ABCA1/apoE double KO (dKO) mice, their respective single KO's, and wild-type (WT) controls and were challenged with a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet for 9 weeks. In vitro cholesterol efflux experiments showed no differences between ABCA1 KO and dKO macrophages. The serum non-HDL/HDL ratio in dKO transplanted mice was 1.7-fold and 2.4-fold (p<0.01) increased compared to WT and ABCA1 KO transplanted mice, respectively. The atherosclerotic lesion area in dKO transplanted animals (650±94×10(3) µm(2)), however, was 1.9-fold (p<0.01) and 1.6-fold (p<0.01) increased compared to single knockouts (ABCA1 KO: 341±20×10(3) µm(2); apoE KO: 402±78×10(3) µm(2), respectively) and 3.1-fold increased (p<0.001) compared to WT (211±20×10(3) µm(2)). When normalized for serum cholesterol exposure, macrophage ABCA1 and apoE independently protected against atherosclerotic lesion development (p<0.001). Moreover, hepatic expression levels of TNFα and IL-6 were highly induced in dKO transplanted animals (3.0-fold; p<0.05, and 4.3-fold; p<0.001, respectively). In agreement, serum IL-6 levels were also enhanced in ABCA1 KO transplanted mice (p<0.05) and even further enhanced in dKO transplanted animals (3.1-fold as compared to ABCA1 KO transplanted animals; p<0.05).
Combined deletion of macrophage ABCA1 and apoE results in a defect in cholesterol efflux and, compared to ABCA1 KO transplanted mice, elevated serum total cholesterol levels. Importantly, these mice also suffer from enhanced systemic and hepatic inflammation, together resulting in the observed augmented atherosclerotic lesion development.
Desmoid tumors are mesenchymal nonmetastasizing neoplasms. Although rare in the general population, they are a common extracolonic manifestation of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Because of high tumor recurrence rates, surgery has been less than satisfactory in the treatment of desmoid tumors. In the current study, high doses of tamoxifen in combination with sulindac were used to treat severe desmoid tumors to avoid surgery.
Since 1992, 25 patients at Heinrich Heine University (Dusseldorf, Germany) were treated with a combination of tamoxifen and sulindac. In the current study, 17 patients with FAP-associated and 8 patients with sporadic desmoid tumors received 120 mg of tamoxifen and 300 mg of sulindac daily. Every 6 months, the protracted course of desmoid growth was measured by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Tumor responses were characterized as progressive disease, stable disease (SD), partial regression (PR), and complete regression (CR).
Of the group of patients who received tamoxifen and sulindac as a primary treatment, all three patients with sporadic desmoid tumors demonstrated cessation of growth, and 10 of the 13 patients with FAP-associated tumors achieved either a PR or CR. In the sporadic desmoid tumor group, eight of nine patients developed tumor recurrences after undergoing surgery at other institutions. Of these, two patients had SD and two patients had a PR to CR.
The patients with desmoid tumors who were managed conservatively with high-dose tamoxifen and sulindac had the best outcome. Desmoid tumor recurrence after surgery was high and in the FAP-associated tumor group, therapy with tamoxifen and sulindac was found to be less successful. Based on this experience, the authors recommended high-dose tamoxifen and sulindac as the primary treatment for patients with FAP-associated desmoid tumors. However, to our knowledge, the best approach after surgical intervention for patients with sporadic desmoid tumors remains to be determined.
Oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome is an X-linked male lethal condition encompassing cardiac septal defects, as well as ocular and dental anomalies. The gene mutated in OFCD syndrome, the BCL-6 corepressor (BCOR), is part of a transcriptional repression complex whose transcriptional targets remain largely unknown. We reviewed cases of OFCD syndrome and identified patients exhibiting defective lateralization including dextrocardia, asplenia and intestinal malrotation, suggesting that BCOR is required in normal laterality determination. To study the function of BCOR, we used morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) to knockdown expression of xtBcor in Xenopus tropicalis, thus creating an animal model for OFCD syndrome. The resulting tadpoles had cardiac and ocular features characteristic of OFCD syndrome. Reversed cardiac orientation and disorganized gut patterning were seen when MOs were injected into the left side of embryos, demonstrating a left-sided requirement for xtBcor in lateral determination in Xenopus. Ocular defects displayed no left-right bias and included anterior and posterior segment disorders such as microphthalmia and coloboma. Expression of xtPitx2c was shown to be downregulated when xtBcor was depleted. This identifies a pathway in which xtBcor is required for lateral specification, a process intrinsically linked to correct cardiac septal development.
Autoantibodies against specific human cytochrome P450s have been found in the sera of patients suffering from a variety of diseases, including those caused by drugs. In the cases of tienilic acid- and dihydralazine-induced hepatitis, patients have serum autoantibodies directed against cytochromes P450 2C9 and P450 1A2, respectively. In the present study, we have found that 25 of 56 (45%) patients diagnosed with halothane hepatitis have autoantibodies that react with human cytochrome P450 2E1 that was purified from a baculovirus expression system. The autoantibodies inhibited the activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 and appeared to be directed against mainly conformational epitopes. In addition, because cytochrome P450 2E1 became trifluoroacetylated when it oxidatively metabolized halothane, it is possible that the covalently altered form of cytochrome P450 2E1 may be able to bypass the immunologic tolerance that normally exists against cytochrome P450 2E1. A similar mechanism may explain the formation of autoantibodies that have been found against other cellular targets of the reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane.
In a 62-year-old female patient petechial haemorrhages of the right breast were observed after the 4th day of treatment with phenprocoumon. Within a few hours large cutaneous necroses developed. Histology showed lymphocytic vasculitis with vessel wall destruction and erythrocytic extravasates as well as necrobiotic changes of the middle and lower corium. High-dosage treatment with prednisolone was started after withdrawal of phenprocoumon. Progression of the necrosis to the left breast could be prevented. However, necrosis of the haemorrhagic area of the right breast could not be arrested. Aetiology and pathomechanisms of coumarin-induced necrosis have to date not been ascertained. Allergic precipitating mechanisms probably were of no importance in our patient.
The healing activity of the ethanol extracts of Piper betel, Emblica officinalis, Terminalia bellerica, and Terminalia chebula against the indomethacin-induced stomach ulceration has been studied and compared with that of misoprostol. Compared to autohealing, all the drugs accelerated the healing process, albeit to different extents. The relative healing activities of the extracts was P. betel>E. officinalis>T. bellerica~T. chebula, that correlated well with their in vivo antioxidant and mucin augmenting activities. The excellent healing activity of the extracts of P. betel and E. officinalis indicated a major role of mucin protection and regeneration in the healing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs mediated stomach ulceration.
Levetiracetam (Keppra) is a new generation antiepileptic drug characterized by a unique profile of activity in experimental models of epilepsy. It also has a distinct binding site in the brain, i.e. the synaptic vesicle protein type 2 (SV2A). Levetiracetam has been reported to have antiepileptogenic and disease-modifying properties. In the present study the effects of chronic treatment with levetiracetam were assessed in rats that sustained pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Hippocampal field potentials were recorded in vivo in anesthetized animals after 3-day washout period that followed 21-day treatment with different doses of levetiracetam (50, 150 or 300 mg/kg/day) administered via ALZET osmotic mini-pumps. Vehicle treated rats together with naive animals (not subjected to SE) were used as control groups. Chronic treatment with levetiracetam yielded clinically relevant plasma concentrations throughout the experiment with complete washout of the drug 3 days after treatment cessation. At this point in time post-SE rats chronically treated with vehicle developed clear signs of hippocampal hyperexcitability, i.e. increased amplitude of population spike (PS) recorded in the dentate gyrus and reduced paired-pulse inhibition in the CA1 area. Levetiracetam treatment dose-dependently counteracted these long-term effects of pilocarpine-induced SE. Furthermore, at the dose of 300 mg/kg/day levetiracetam restored these parameters back to control level. The present results indicate that chronic treatment with levetiracetam completely inhibits the development of hippocampal hyperexcitability following pilocarpine-induced SE.
Melatonin, the secretory product of the pineal gland, has potent antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of low-dose (10 mg/kg) vs high-dose (50 mg/kg) melatonin on early lipid peroxidation levels and ultrastructural changes in experimental blunt sciatic nerve injury (SNI). We believe this to be the first study to assess the dose-dependent neuroprotective effects of melatonin after a blunt peripheral nerve injury.
Rats were randomly allocated into 5 groups of 10 animals each. The SNI only rats underwent a nerve injury procedure. The SNI plus vehicle group received SNI and intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (diluted ethanol) as a placebo. The SNI plus low-dose or high-dose melatonin groups received intraperitoneal melatonin at doses of 10 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg, respectively. Controls had no operation, melatonin or vehicle injection. SNI was induced by clamping the sciatic nerve at the upper border of the quadratus femoris for 2 min.
Sciatic nerve samples were harvested 6 h after nerve injury and processed for biochemical and ultrastructural analysis. Trauma increased the lipid peroxidation of the sciatic nerve by 3.6-fold (153.85 +/- 18.73 in SNI only vs 41.73 +/- 2.23 in control rats, P < 0.01). Low (P = 0.02) and high (P < 0.01) doses of melatonin attenuated the nerve lipid peroxidation by 25% and 57.25%, respectively (65.76 +/- 2.47 in high-dose vs 115.08 +/- 7.03 in low-dose melatonin groups).
Although low-dose melatonin reduced trauma-induced myelin breakdown and axonal changes in the sciatic nerve, high-dose melatonin almost entirely neutralized any ultrastructural changes.
Our results suggest that melatonin, especially at a dose of 50 mg/kg, has a potent neuroprotective effect and can preserve peripheral neural fibers from lipid peroxidative damage after blunt trauma. With further investigations, we hope that these data may prove useful to clinicians who treat patients with nerve injuries.
Acute renal failure is a complication attributed to numerous medications. Few cases linked to the newer fluoroquinolones have been described. We report a case of acute interstitial nephritis confirmed by renal biopsy that developed in a patient within days of starting ciprofloxacin therapy. A review of the literature reveals common clinical manifestations of this rare adverse effect. Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication of ciprofloxacin use.
Because survival for patients with oral cancer has not improved over the past 25 years, new approaches for treatment are needed. Targeted molecular therapy against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has shown promise as an adjuvant therapy in preliminary studies in several solid tumors, including head and neck cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of paclitaxel and PKI166, a novel inhibitor of EGFR, against oral cavity cancer.
JMAR human oral cancer cells were pretreated for 1 h with PKI166 and then stimulated with epidermal growth factor. EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation measured by Western immunoblotting was inhibited by PKI166 in a dose-dependent fashion at all doses tested (0.01-1 micro M). Next, the induction of apoptosis in JMAR cells treated with paclitaxel (0.001 to 0.1 micro M) with or without PKI166 (0, 1, or 2 micro M) was determined using a propidium iodide assay. The addition of 2.0 micro M PKI166 significantly increased tumor cell death, shifting the amount of paclitaxel needed to induce apoptosis in 50% of cells from 0.1 to 0.001 micro M. These in vitro findings were confirmed using an orthotopic model of oral cancer. JMAR oral cancer cells were implanted into the tongues of nude mice. After lingual tumors developed, mice were randomized into four groups (n = 10): (a) oral PKI166 (100 mg/kg); (b) i.p. paclitaxel (200 micro g/wk); (c) PKI166 and paclitaxel; or (d) placebo. Mice treated with PKI166/paclitaxel demonstrated a significant increase in survival (P = 0.028). After necropsy, all tongue tumors were evaluated for apoptosis by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay. A greater apoptotic fraction of tumor cells was found in tumors of mice treated with paclitaxel and PKI166 as compared with the other treatment groups (136.4 versus 37.8; P = 0.016).
Combination therapy with paclitaxel and PKI166 prolongs survival in an orthotopic preclinical model of tongue cancer by increasing programmed cell death of oral cancer.
We presented a rare case of tetanic crisis in a 23-year old mentally retarded woman with epilepsy after treatment by oxcarbazepine, the new anticonvulsant agent. We reviewed laboratory, radiographic and medical examinations and recommend a proper treatment in such cases.
The laboratory tests revealed only severe hypocalcemia. We described the potential role of oxcarbazepine in the induction of activity of cytochrome P 450 system of hepar and increases of less active metabolism of vitamin D. Supplementation of vitamin D and calcium in patients taking antiepileptic drugs is in the same case crucial.
The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor selegiline has demonstrated antidepressant efficacy superior to placebo. A selegiline transdermal system (STS) has been developed with unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that allow inhibition of central nervous system MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes while substantially avoiding inhibition of intestinal and liver MAO-A enzyme. This novel transdermal system provides targeted MAO inhibition without clinically significant increases in sensitivity to dietary tyramine. We investigated the safety and efficacy of STS in patients with major depressive disorder.
365 outpatients 18 to 65 years old with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder were enrolled at 16 sites. A 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score of > or = 20 was required for entry. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either STS, 20 mg/20 cm(2), daily or placebo patch for up to 8 weeks. A tyramine-restricted diet was neither required nor advised. Efficacy, safety, and vital sign measures were obtained regularly.
289 patients were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least 1 on-therapy evaluation (STS, N = 145; placebo, N = 144). Although the effect size was modest, at endpoint, STS was statistically superior to placebo on the MADRS (p =.001) and HAM-D-28 (p =.039) ratings and showed a nonsignificant superiority on the HAM-D-17 (p =.069) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity ratings (p <.055). Side effect profiles were similar for STS and placebo with the exception of application-site reaction, which was observed in 31.5% of STS patients and 15.1% of placebo-treated patients (p =.001). No significant differences were observed in blood pressure measures between treatment groups.
Results from this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrate that STS may have a modest, but statistically significant, antidepressant benefit compared with placebo and a similar safety profile compared with placebo in the absence of a tyramine-restricted diet.
Membrane-bound receptors generate soluble ligand-binding domains either by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain or alternative mRNA splicing yielding a secreted protein. Mertk (Mer) is in a receptor tyrosine kinase family with Axl and Tyro-3, and all 3 receptors share the Gas6 ligand. Mer regulates macrophage activation, promotes apoptotic cell engulfment, and supports platelet aggregation and clot stability in vivo. We have found that the membrane-bound Mer protein is cleaved in the extracellular domain via a metalloproteinase. The cleavage results in the production of a soluble Mer protein released in a constitutive manner from cultured cells. Significant amounts of the soluble Mer protein were also detected in human plasma, suggesting its physiologic relevance. Cleavage of Mer was enhanced by treatment with LPS and PMA and was specifically inhibited by a tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme metalloproteinase inhibitor. As a decoy receptor for Gas6, soluble Mer prevented Gas6-mediated stimulation of membrane-bound Mer. The inhibition of Gas6 activity by soluble Mer led to defective macrophage-mediated engulfment of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, soluble Mer decreased platelet aggregation in vitro and prevented fatal collagen/epinephrine-induced thromboembolism in mice, suggesting a potential therapeutic use for soluble Mer in the treatment of clotting disorders.
Experimental "vascular" headache in humans may be used in characterizing new migraine drugs. The effects of sumatriptan on nitroglycerin-(NTG)-induced headache and arterial responses were therefore studied. Following a double-blind randomized crossover design, 10 healthy volunteers received sumatriptan 6 mg s.c. or placebo succeeded by 20 min NTG (0.12 microgram/kg/min) infusion. Headache was rated on a 10 points scale. Temporal and radial artery diameters and velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were measured with ultrasound. Sumatriptan reduced the NTG-induced headache, median score 1.5 versus 4 after placebo (p < 0.01) and decreased temporal and radial artery diameters 75 +/- 3 and 86 +/- 3% of baseline respectively (p < 0.05). Blood velocity in the MCA was unaffected. The NTG model may prove to be a valuable tool in the development of future migraine drugs. The results suggest that NTG headache in non-migraineurs may share mechanisms with migraine headache.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in clinical medicine. Their utility is, however, often limited by the adverse effects they produce in the gastrointestinal tract. Oxidative stress has been shown to occur in the small intestine in response to the oral administration of indomethacin, an NSAID commonly used in toxicity studies. In view of this, the effect of curcumin, an agent with anti-oxidant properties, was evaluated on indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage in a rat model. Rats were pretreated with various doses of curcumin (20 mg kg(-1), 40 mg kg(-1) and 80 mg kg(-1)) before administering indomethacin at 20 mg kg(-1). Various parameters of oxidative stress and the extent of small intestinal damage produced by indomethacin, with and without pretreatment with curcumin, were measured. Macroscopic ulceration was found to occur in the small intestine in response to indomethacin. The viability of enterocytes from indomethacin-treated animals was significantly lower than those from control animals. Drug-induced oxidative stress was also evident as seen by increases in the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl and in activities of pro-oxidant enzymes such as myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase in indomethacin-treated rats. Concomitant decreases were seen in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase in these animals. Pretreatment with curcumin was found to ameliorate these drug-induced changes. Thus, curcumin appears to hold promise as an agent that can potentially reduce NSAID-induced small intestinal damage.
We report the case of a 15-year-old male developing progressive myocardiopathy secondary to late anthracycline cardiotoxicity. At 2 years of age, the patient received chemotherapy with anthracyclines (adriamycin) at an accumulated dose of 510 mg/m2 due to the presence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma which subsided completely and he has been asymptomatic since then. A number of recurrent respiratory infections occurred as triggering factors of the condition, and the laboratory tests evidenced positive serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae suggesting a recent contact.
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by adrenergic induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardias and associated with sudden cardiac death. The human cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) was linked to CPVT. A 20-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of recurrent syncope after physical and emotional stress. Routine cardiac examinations including catheterization revealed no structural abnormality. Exercise on treadmill induced premature ventricular contraction in bigeminy and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia was induced during isoproterenol infusion. Beta-blocking drug was effective in suppressing the arrhythmias. We performed genetic screening by PCR-SSCP method followed by DNA sequencing, and a novel missense mutation R2401H in RyR2 located in FKBP12.6 binding region was identified. This mutation was not detected in 190 healthy controls. Since FKBP12.6 plays a critical role in Ca channel gating, the R2401H mutation can be expected to alter Ca-induced Ca release and E-C coupling resulting in CPVT. This is the first report of RyR2 mutation in CPVT patient from Asia including Japan.
Artemisia vulgaris L. is widely used in the Philippines for its anti-inflammatory properties. The plant was cultivated and mature leaves were collected and washed. The dried leaves were extracted with both distilled water and chloroform. NMR data were obtained using a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrophotometer. High and low-resolution mass spectra were obtained on a Finnigan MAT 96 high resolution gas chromatograph/mass spectrophotometer with a MAT ICIS operating system. The leaves yielded 2 sesquiterpene lactones and a novel aromatic compound. Two partition fractions from the aqueous extracts and four partition fractions from the chloroform extracts were tested on male Sprague-Dawley rats using both the in situ mesenteric circulation and the isolated perfused mesentery. In the isolated perfused rat mesentery, administration of 10% w/v solutions of water extract fractions FGN 63-1 and FGN 63-2 of A. vulgaris were highly effective in reversing the hypertensive action induced by norepinephrine, but they did not change the regional mesenteric pressures when given at baseline. In the intact rat, injection of 10 mg/ml of FGN 63-1 and chloroform extract FGN 64-2 did not significantly alter baseline blood pressures, but were able to reverse the increase in mean systolic and diastolic pressures induced by norepinephrine. The same fractions did not exert any significant effect on heart rate in either the normotensive or hypertensive states. The present data suggest that aqueous and chloroform extracts from leaves of A. vulgaris have anti-hypertensive actions but have no significant effects on cardiovascular hemodynamics under basal conditions.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, Nr1h4) is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. FXR is essential in maintaining bile acid (BA) homeostasis, and FXR(-/-) mice develop cholestasis, inflammation, and spontaneous liver tumors. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is well known to regulate liver growth, and STAT3 is feedback inhibited by its target gene, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). Strong activation of STAT3 was detected in FXR(-/-) mouse livers. However, the mechanism of STAT3 activation with FXR deficiency remains elusive. Wild-type (WT) and FXR(-/-) mice were used to detect STAT3 pathway activation in the liver. In vivo BA feeding or deprivation was used to determine the role of BAs in STAT3 activation, and in vitro molecular approaches were used to determine the direct transcriptional regulation of SOCS3 by FXR. STAT3 was activated in FXR(-/-) but not WT mice. BA feeding increased, but deprivation by cholestyramine reduced, serum inflammatory markers and STAT3 activation. Furthermore, the Socs3 gene was determined as a direct FXR target gene. The elevated BAs and inflammation, along with reduced SOCS3, collectively contribute to the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in the liver of FXR(-/-) mice. This study suggests that the constitutive activation of STAT3 may be a mechanism of liver carcinogenesis in FXR(-/-) mice.
The p21 RAS subfamily of small GTPases, including KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS, regulates cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, and other signaling networks, and is the most frequent target of activating mutations in cancer. Activating germline mutations of KRAS and HRAS cause severe developmental abnormalities leading to Noonan, cardio-facial-cutaneous, and Costello syndrome, but activating germline mutations of NRAS have not been reported. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is the most common genetic disease of lymphocyte apoptosis and causes autoimmunity as well as excessive lymphocyte accumulation, particularly of CD4(-), CD8(-) alphabeta T cells. Mutations in ALPS typically affect CD95 (Fas/APO-1)-mediated apoptosis, one of the extrinsic death pathways involving TNF receptor superfamily proteins, but certain ALPS individuals have no such mutations. We show here that the salient features of ALPS as well as a predisposition to hematological malignancies can be caused by a heterozygous germline Gly13Asp activating mutation of the NRAS oncogene that does not impair CD95-mediated apoptosis. The increase in active, GTP-bound NRAS augments RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, which markedly decreases the proapoptotic protein BIM and attenuates intrinsic, nonreceptor-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Thus, germline activating mutations in NRAS differ from other p21 Ras oncoproteins by causing selective immune abnormalities without general developmental defects. Our observations on the effects of NRAS activation indicate that RAS-inactivating drugs, such as farnesyltransferase inhibitors should be examined in human autoimmune and lymphocyte homeostasis disorders.
We conducted a dose-finding and feasibility study in which we administered a fixed dose 3-h infusion of paclitaxel and an escalating dose of cisplatin in Japanese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Chemotherapy consisted of fixed dose (210 mg/m(2)) paclitaxel given over 3 h on day 1 and an escalating dose of cisplatin on day 2, every 3-4 weeks. The dose of cisplatin was 40 mg/m(2) at level 1, 60 mg/m(2) at level 2 and 80 mg/m(2) at level 3.
Between October 1999 and February 2001, 24 patients were enrolled and 58 cycles were administered. The major hematological toxicities were leukopenia and neutropenia. Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 83.3%, 66.7% and 83.3% of patients at the dose levels of 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The major non-hematological toxicities consisted of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation and peripheral neuropathy. Grade 3 ALT elevation was observed in two of the 12 patients at level 3, but both recovered within 3 days. The peripheral neuropathy was sensory-dominant and frequent, and it was almost tolerable. The maximum tolerated dose was not identified even at the highest dose of paclitaxel (210 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (80 mg/m(2)) administered in the study. The recommended dose was determined to be paclitaxel 210 mg/m(2) on day 1 and cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) on day 2, every 3-4 weeks. Seven partial responses were observed in the 24 patients.
The combination of paclitaxel 210 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) was found to be a well-tolerated active regimen in Japanese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
We investigated whether cytolytic melittin peptides could inhibit HIV-1 infectivity when carried in a nanoparticle construct that might be used as a topical vaginal virucide. Free melittin and melittin-loaded nanoparticles were prepared and compared for cytotoxicity and their ability to inhibit infectivity by CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic HIV-1 strains.
TZM-bl reporter cells expressing luciferase under the control of the HIV-1 promoter were incubated with HIV-1 NLHX (CXCR4) or HIV-1 NLYU2 (CCR5) viral strains and different doses of soluble CD4 (positive control) or free melittin to determine infectivity and viability. Melittin-loaded nanoparticles were formulated and different doses tested against VK2 vaginal epithelial cells to determine cell viability. Based on VK2 viability, melittin nanoparticles were tested for prevention of CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic HIV-1 infectivity and viability of TZM-bl reporter cells. Low-speed centrifugation was used to compare the ability of blank non-melittin nanoparticles and melittin nanoparticles to capture CCR5 tropic HIV-1.
As expected, the soluble CD4 positive control inhibited CXCR4 (50% inhibitory concentration [IC₅₀] 3.7 μg/ml) and CCR5 (IC₅₀ 0.03 μg/ml) tropic HIV-1 infectivity. Free melittin doses <2 μM were not cytotoxic and were highly effective in reducing HIV-1 infectivity for both CXCR4 and CCR5 strains in TZM-bl reporter cells, while VK2 vaginal cell viability was adversely affected at all free melittin doses tested. However, VK2 cell viability was not affected at any dose of melittin-loaded nanoparticles. Melittin nanoparticles safely and significantly decreased CXCR4 (IC₅₀ 2.4 μM and IC₉₀ 6.9 μM) and CCR5 (IC₅₀ 3.6 μM and IC₉₀ 11.4 μM) strain infectivity of TZM-bl reporter cells. Furthermore, melittin nanoparticles captured more HIV-1 than blank nanoparticles.
These data illustrate the first proof-of-concept for therapeutic and safe nanoparticle-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. Future investigations appear warranted to explore the antiviral prophylactic potential of melittin nanoparticles to capture, disrupt and prevent initial infection with HIV-1 or potentially other enveloped viruses.
