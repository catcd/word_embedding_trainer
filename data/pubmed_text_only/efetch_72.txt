Stavudine is a promising antiretroviral agent, but its clinical efficacy has not been determined.
To evaluate the clinical effect of stavudine (2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine) monotherapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
Randomized, controlled, double-blind trial.
56 outpatient clinics in private practices, universities, and contract research organizations in the United States, France, and Italy.
822 HIV-infected adults who had 50 to 500 CD4+ cells/mm3 and had previously received at least 6 months of zidovudine treatment.
Monotherapy with peroral stavudine capsules or peroral zidovudine capsules.
The primary end point was clinical progression, which was defined as all occurrences of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining events or death.
Patients receiving stavudine reached clinical end points at a rate of 26 per 100 person-years, compared with 32 per 100 person-years for patients receiving zidovudine (relative risk, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.98]; P = 0.03). The risk for death alone was 26% lower in the stavudine group than in the zidovudine group, but the comparison was not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.74 [CI, 0.53 to 1.02]; P = 0.066). The benefit of stavudine therapy was seen in all CD4+ cell strata (< or = 100 cells/mm3, 101 to 300 cells/mm3, and > 300 cells/mm3) and clinical stages of HIV disease (asymptomatic, symptomatic, and AIDS). Four weeks after treatment began, CD4+ cell counts were 30 cells/mm3 higher in the stavudine group than in the zidovudine group; this difference was sustained for 96 weeks (P < 0.001). Nausea and vomiting were more common in patients receiving zidovudine (P < 0.01), and neuropathy occurred more frequently in those receiving stavudine (12% in the stavudine group compared with 4% in the zidovudine group; P < 0.001). Neuropathy resolved completely in many patients (63%) after interruption of stavudine treatment; these patients could resume stavudine therapy at a lower dose.
Stavudine was well tolerated and delayed progression of HIV disease in patients who had previously received 6 or more months of zidovudine treatment. Benefits were apparent in all CD4+ cell strata and clinical stages of HIV disease. Stavudine is an important agent to consider for trials of combination chemotherapy.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin E on oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle of glucocorticoid-treated rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (5 weeks of age) were fed a basal diet or a diet supplemented with vitamin E (5,000 mg DL-alpha-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet) for 10 d. The rats of both diet groups received subcutaneous injections of corticosterone (CTC) (0, 25, and 100 mg/kg body weight/d) during the final 4 d. Weights of the extensor digitorum longus and gastrocnemius (GAST) muscles were dose-dependently reduced by CTC. However, the muscle weight losses in rats fed the vitamin E diet were smaller than those in rats fed the basal diet. Protein carbonyl content in the GAST muscle, which was determined as an index of oxidatively modified protein, was increased by 100 mg of CTC, and the increment was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced by vitamin E supplement. Hyperglycemia was induced by 100 mg of CTC, but it was not affected by vitamin E. Lipid peroxide (TBARS) in plasma and in GAST muscle was elevated by 100 mg of CTC, and vitamin E significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed the formation of TBARS in the muscle. The change in TBARS paralleled that in protein carbonyl. These results show that CTC leads to oxidative stress in rat skeletal muscles and that vitamin E has roles in reducing the oxidative stress which causes muscle atrophy.
The effect of repeated (4 weeks) oral administration of 2,4-, 2,5- or 2,6-xylidine (at dose levels of 400--500 mg/kg/day) on the morphology and microsomal drug metabolising enzyme activity of the liver was studied in rats. All 3 isomers caused hepatomegaly which was considered to be due to proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Decreases in glycogen content and glucose-6-phosphatase activity were demonstrated histochemically. Biochemical investigations showed increases in microsomal protein and cytochrome P-450 content in rats dosed with 2,4- or 2,5-xylidine and in glucuronyltransferase activity in rats given 2,4-, 2,5- or 2,6-xylidine. Aniline hydroxylase activity was increased in all treated rats except males dosed with 2,6-xylidine. The results of the study indicate that all isomes of xylidine can be inducers of microsomal drug-metabolising enzyme activity, that they may be metabolised by oxidation and that the xylidine molecule may be eliminated as a conjugate with glucuronic acid.
Two infants with supraventricular tachycardia were given intravenous verapamil and subsequently suffered life threatening bradycardia and hypotension. As there were no predisposing factors, direct drug action is implicated and other reports of the adverse effects of verapamil are noted. Supraventricular tachycardia in neonates and young infants may be safely treated with digoxin and cardioversion, and intravenous verapamil should be avoided.
Substance abuse is a frequent co-morbid condition of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment with conventional psychostimulants in adult ADHD with co-morbid stimulant abuse may be problematic. In this study, we report the case of a patient with adult ADHD with co-morbid amphetamine abuse who was treated successfully with the non-stimulant alertness-promoting drug modafinil. The drug resolved both the inattention/hyperactivity symptoms as well as the amphetamine abuse. Modafinil may be a suitable candidate treatment for adults with ADHD and stimulant abuse.
A large body of clinical, genetic, and biochemical evidence indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key enzyme for prostanoid biosynthesis, contributes to the promotion of colorectal cancer. COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most abundant prostaglandin found in several gastrointestinal malignancies. Although PGE2 enhances intestinal adenoma growth in Apcmin mice, the mechanism(s) by which it accelerates tumor growth is not completely understood. Here we investigated how PGE2 promotes intestinal tumor growth and the signaling pathways responsible for its effects. We observed that PGE2 treatment leads to increased epithelial cell proliferation and induces COX-2 expression in intestinal adenomas. Furthermore, we show that PGE2 regulation of COX-2 expression is mediated by activation of a Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. One intriguing finding is that COX-2-derived PGE2 mimics the effects of constitutively active Ras through a self-amplifying loop that allows for a distinct growth advantage.
Patients suffering from schizophrenic psychoses sometimes insufficiently respond to antipsychotic monotherapy and then combination approaches are preferred. We aimed in validating the add-on of ziprasidone and risperidone to clozapine, and we performed a randomised head-to-head trial. Patients with partial response to clozapine were randomly attributed to augmentation with ziprasidone (n = 12) or risperidone (n = 12). Efficacy assessments included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). Furthermore, several safety and tolerability measures were obtained. After six weeks, both groups showed significant reductions of positive and negative symptoms. In addition, affective state, psychosocial functioning and clozapine side effects improved without significant differences between the groups. Both approaches were well tolerated. However, the ziprasidone group experienced a small elongation of the QTc interval and a reduction of extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients under clozapine-risperidone therapy developed a rise of serum prolactin levels. The clozapine augmentation with ziprasidone or risperidone resulted in significant psychopathological improvements. The side effects differed between the treatment groups. Further head-to-head comparisons of atypical antipsychotics as add-on to clozapine are necessary.
The nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II is a candidate pharmacological target for treating herpes virus infections and the novel catalytic inhibitors, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydroxyacridone (compound 1), and 1,3,7-trihydroxyacridone (2) are potential lead compounds [Bastow, K.F., Itoigawa, M., Furukawa, H., Kashiwada, Y., Bori, I.D., Ballas, L.M., Lee, K.-H., 1994. Antiproliferative actions of 7-substituted 1,3-dihydroxyacridones; possible involvement of DNA topoisomerase II and protein kinase C as biochemical targets. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2, 1403-1411; Vance, J.R., Bastow, K.F., 1999. Inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II catalytic activity by the antiviral agents 7-chloro,1,3-dihydroxyacridone and 1,3,7-trihydroxyacridone. Biochem. Pharmacol. 58, 703-708]. In this report, four new 1,3-dihydroxyacridone analogs with functional groups at either the 5-, 6- or 8-positions (compounds 3-6) were synthesized. Target compounds, three other analogs including compounds 1 and 2 and three anticancer drugs that inhibit DNA topoisomerase II (etoposide, amsacrine and aclarubicin) were then evaluated as selective inhibitors of herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication in cell culture and as enzyme inhibitors in vitro. Etoposide and amsacrine inhibited HSV but acted non-selectively. In general, the activities of 1,3-dihydroxyacridone derivatives as selective anti-HSV agents and as enzyme inhibitors varied inversely suggesting that DNA topoisomerase II probably is not the critical antiviral target. The 5-Cl congener (compound 3) was the most selective agent (about 26-fold under a stringent assay condition) but was not an enzyme inhibitor. Results of exploratory mechanistic studies with compounds 1 and 3 show that HSV replication was blocked at a stage after DNA and late protein synthesis. The acridone derivatives were also tested against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication but none of them were active.
Effects of purinergic agonists (alpha,beta-meATP and ATP) and cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis on bladder afferent nerve (BAN) activity were studied in an in vitro bladder-pelvic nerve preparation. Distension of the bladder induced spontaneous bladder contractions that were accompanied by multiunit afferent firing. Intravesical administration of 40 and 130 microM alpha,beta-meATP increased afferent firing from 27 +/- 3 to 53 +/- 6 and 61 +/- 2 spikes/s, respectively, but did not change the maximum amplitude of spontaneous bladder contractions. Electrical stimulation on the surface of the bladder elicited action potentials (AP) in BAN. alpha,beta-meATP decreased the voltage threshold from 9.0 +/- 1.2 to 3.5 +/- 0.5 V (0.15-ms pulse duration) and increased the area of the APs (82% at 80-V stimulus intensity). These effects were blocked by TNP-ATP (30 microM). ATP (2 mM) applied in the bath produced similar changes in BAN activity. These effects were blocked by bath application of PPADS (30 microM). Neither TNP-ATP nor PPADS affected BAN activity induced by distension of the bladder. Cystitis induced by pretreatment of the rats with cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg ip) increased afferent firing in response to isotonic bladder distension (10-40 cmH(2)O), decreased the threshold, and increased the area of evoked APs. The increase in afferent firing at 10 cmH(2)O intravesical pressure was reduced 52% by PPADS. These results indicate that purinergic agonists acting on P2X receptors and cystitis induced by cyclophosphamide can increase excitability of the BANs.
A urinary steroid profile from a patient with suspected 3 beta-HSD deficiency was prepared using capillary gas chromatography, employing only enzymatic deconjugation with Helix pomatia juice. In the chromatogram only very small peaks of dehydroepiandrosterone and 5-pregnenetriol were visible apart from other, for the diagnosis non-significant, peaks. However, after repeating the analysis including an additional solvolysis step, highly significant peaks of DHEA and 5-pregnenetriol became apparent, which suggests the necessity for a solvolysis step for a positive proof of 3 beta-HSD deficiency by urinary steroid profiling.
Painful diabetic neuropathy causes hyperalgesia and does not respond to commonly used analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids at doses below those producing disruptive side effects. In the present study, we examined the effect of P2X receptor antagonists, which are known to modulate the pain pathway, on mechanical hyperalgesia in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. The paw withdrawal frequency measured by von Frey filaments, began to significantly increase 5 days after STZ injection and was maintained for more than 14 days. Intrathecal administration of P2X receptor antagonists (PPADS and TNP-ATP) inhibited the mechanical allodynia in diabetic mice. The levels of P2X(2) and P2X(3) receptors mRNA were significantly increased in diabetic mice at 14 days after the intravenous injection of STZ. These results suggest that the upregulation of P2X(2), P2X(3) and/or P2X(2/3) receptor in DRG neurons is associated with mechanical allodynia in STZ-induced diabetic mice.
A major metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, causes behavioral activation that progresses to seizures when given intraventricularly to 2-week-old rats. The seizures are characterized by running, hopping, and vocalizing and are mixed with shorter-duration tonic episodes. Pretreatment with haloperidol, at a dose aimed at blocking stereotyped behavior, did not suppress these behaviors. In contrast, seizures were prevented by antiepileptic drugs, with the order of potency being diazepam greater than phenobarbital greater than phenytoin. We hypothesize that the long-lasting cocaine metabolite, benzoylecgonine, contributes to the infant cocaine intoxication syndrome.
The literature evidencing the role of iron in promoting a range of neoplasms in humans and animals prompted us to search for a possible association between chemically induced hemosiderosis and hemangiosarcomas in the liver of mice in selected studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP). Its historical control database was examined for studies in which treatment-related liver hemangiosarcoma was noted; 130 consecutive NTP studies in B6C3F1 mice from Technical Report (TR)-340 to TR-493 were evaluated. Three compounds (2-butoxyethanol, p-nitroaniline, and para-chloroaniline) were associated with a relatively high incidence of Kupffer cell pigmentation consisting of hemosiderin in both sexes; only the male mice developed a relatively low incidence of treatment-related hemangiosarcoma. With a fourth compound (o-nitroanisole), a relatively low incidence (16/50, high-dose males) of chemical-related hemosiderosis was noted, with no associated increase of hemangiosarcoma. Two chemicals (pentachlorophenol and tetrafluoroethylene) increased the incidence of liver hemangiosarcoma in male and female mice, with no increase in Kupffer cell pigmentation. The overall association between liver hemangiosarcoma and Kupffer cell pigmentation was highly significant (p < 0.001). The cause for hemosiderosis in all cases was the erythrocytic hemolytic effect of the compounds. The reason for the sex-increased susceptibility for development of hemangiosarcoma is unknown but may be due to a hormone-related, reduced antioxidative defensive capacity through modulation of the activities of antioxidative enzymes.
This study set out to evaluate the hearing changes that occur during intratympanic gentamicin therapy and to correlate them with the long-term effects of the treatment on the control of vertigo and on hearing.
This was a prospective study.
Tertiary medical center.
The 71 patients included in the study had been diagnosed with unilateral Ménière's Disease as defined within the 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, and had been refractory to medical treatment for at least 1 year.
Intratympanic injections of gentamicin at a concentration of 27 mg/ml were performed at weekly intervals until indications of vestibular hypofunction appeared in the treated ear. If there was a recurrence of the episodes of vertigo, an additional course of injections was performed.
The 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery criteria for reporting the treatment outcome for Ménière's Disease were used. During the period of gentamicin instillation, weekly audiograms were obtained. The results of the treatment were expressed in terms of control of vertigo and hearing level.
Vertigo was controlled by gentamicin instillation in 83.1% of the 71 patients. Two years after the treatment, hearing loss as a result of the gentamicin injections was observed in only 11 (15.5%) patients. The recurrence of spells of vertigo after having initially achieved complete control was noted in 17 (23.9%) patients. Hearing loss at the end of the treatment occurred in 32.4% of the patients, but it was transitory so that 3 months after ending the treatment it was 12.7% and after 2 years it was 15.5%. Those patients in whom no change in their level of hearing occurred during the treatment needed another course of injections and presented poorer overall control of vertigo.
Ending weekly intratympanic injections when clinical signs of vestibular deafferentation appear results in the control of vertigo in the majority of patients. The hearing changes detected during the treatment are transitory and are the only clinical sign that predicts the response to gentamicin instillation.
There are only a few data on the prevalence of drug-induced liver injury associated with fatal outcome. The aim of this study was to determine the nature and number of suspected adverse drug-induced liver disease associated with fatalities and/or liver transplantation since reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) started in Sweden.
All reports of suspected hepatic ADRs with fatal outcome received by the Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (SADRAC) from 1966 to 2002 were reviewed and causality assessed.
The SADRAC received 151 reports of suspected ADRs with fatal outcome from liver injury; 48 cases were either unlikely or excluded. Of the remaining 103 cases, 13 (13%) were highly probable, 48 (47%) probable and 42 (41%) possible. The median age of the 103 patients was 64 years (47-77 interquartile range (IQR)) and 59 (57%) were males. The majority of cases were classified as hepatocellular (75%), with only 15% cholestatic and 10% mixed. Halothane, paracetamol, flucloxacillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and diclofenac were the most common drugs associated with fatal outcome. Seventeen patients underwent liver transplantation, most commonly because of paracetamol and disulfiram toxicity.
A wide range of suspected ADRs are associated with fatalities. Antibiotics and analgesics are associated with the greatest number of reports of deaths.
Therapeutic use of D-penicillamine has been associated with a range of adverse effects. We present a patient with scleroderma, treated with D-penicillamine for 5 years, who developed severe renal failure due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with both crescents and subepithelial immune deposits on renal biopsy. Serological findings included perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and antihistone antibodies. She was treated with cyclophosphamide, prednisone, discontinuation of D-penicillamine, and hemodialysis. Therapy resulted in partial recovery of renal function. The clinical course of our patient is in keeping with D-penicillamine-induced chronic membranous nephropathy, followed by rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis. We discuss the effects of D-penicillamine in our patient, and review the literature on immune-mediated renal disease associated with the use of this drug.
Developments in the molecular biology and pharmacology of GLU(K5), a subtype of the kainate class of ionotropic glutamate receptors, have enabled insights into the roles of this subunit in synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, little is known about the possible functions of GLU(K5)-containing kainate receptors in pathological conditions. We report here that, in hippocampal slices, selective antagonists of GLU(K5)-containing kainate receptors prevented development of epileptiform activity--evoked by the muscarinic agonist, pilocarpine--and inhibited the activity when it was pre-established. In conscious rats, these GLU(K5) antagonists prevented and interrupted limbic seizures induced by intra-hippocampal pilocarpine perfusion, and attenuated accompanying rises in extracellular L-glutamate and GABA. This anticonvulsant activity occurred without overt side effects. GLU(K5) antagonism also prevented epileptiform activity induced by electrical stimulation, both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose that subtype-selective GLU(K5) kainate receptor antagonists offer a potential new therapy for epilepsy.
A 72-year-old female underwent off-pump coronary bypass grafting one month after heparin exposure. Immediately after protamine administration, she developed hypotension due to acute graft failure. Grafting to left anterior descending branch was revised under intra-aortic balloon pump insertion and she was transferred to intensive care unit under stable hemodynamic condition. However, she gradually developed low cardiac output syndrome and echocardiography showed new onset of myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography on the first postoperative day revealed diffuse serious coronary thrombosis involving all grafts and grafted native coronary arteries. Emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed for native vessels. Laboratory examination revealed severe progressive thrombocytopenia and she was clinically diagnosed as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). After cessation of all heparins and alternative anticoagulation with argatroban, thrombocytopenia was improved and some of occluded grafts were recanalized. She was discharged on the 51st postoperative day. Acute graft thrombosis, especially caused by HIT, is a serious complication, which sometimes results in mortality. This is a successful case treated by PCI followed by an alternative anticoagulation.
The absence of cortical responses to external stimuli is a dubious clinical sign during the first 1-2 days of brain injury. We previously showed that the amplitude of the somatic evoked potential (SEP) in the swine is diminished at the infarct site and perihematomal surround within the first 6 h of collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We now report that this depressed SEP persists during the subchronic (48 h) period of ICH in the swine not only within the injured primary somatosensory (SI) cortex, but also in the contralateral homotopic SI cortex. This impairment of sensory responsiveness was accompanied by increases in various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in different brain regions. By 24 h, a marked rise in MMP-9, an inflammatory marker, was detected in the white matter of the ipsilesional SI and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and in the contralesional SI gray matter, as compared to saline-injected controls. A subsequent increase in MMP-9 level was found in the ipsilesional SI and SII gray matter, and in the contralesional SI white matter by 48 h (P<0.05). By 7 days, significant levels of MMP-9 were detected only in the ipsilesional SI white and gray matter tissues. In contrast, the elevation of MMP-2, a marker of degeneration, was delayed until 7 days post-ICH in the ipsilesional SII gray matter. A significant rise in MMP-9 was also noted in CA1 of the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres during 1-2 days. Our MMP assay shows that the depressed cortical excitability seen in the contralateral SI cortex is a manifestation of the broad effect of a focal ICH that produces inflammatory and degenerative processes not only in the region adjacent to the focal ICH site, but also in remote regions that are functionally connected to the site of focal ICH.
Meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), a serotonin agonist and metabolite of the anti-depressant trazodone, was administered chronically to eight moderate to severely affected Alzheimer patients to determine whether it would produce improvement in behavioral symptoms complicating this illness. In doses up to 80 mg/day for 16 days, m-CPP was well tolerated and resulted in small but significant increases in anergy and depression-related symptoms compared with placebo. The effects of chronic m-CPP in this study contrast with the reported beneficial effects of the parent compound trazodone and selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer patients.
Statins are an established therapeutic modality for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Although they generally exhibit a good efficacy and tolerability profile, their reputation has been tarnished as a result of reports of myotoxicity and, more recently, observations of proteinuria. The increased incidence of proteinuria with rosuvastatin was of particular concern, and raised questions about the renoprotective actions of statins. Different hypotheses have been put forward to explain the mechanisms of statin-induced proteinuria. The multifarious effects of statins, independent of their effects on cholesterol-lowering, form the basis of such hypotheses. However, rosuvastatin-associated proteinuria is transient and reversible and even at the highest dose did not affect renal function after prolonged treatment. It would appear that clinically relevant proteinuria is not associated solely with rosuvastatin and might represent a minor class effect of statins with a fairly low incidence. However, definitive proof of this assertion will need to be provided by rigorous testing.
Costello syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising growth deficiency, mental retardation, curly hair, coarse facial features, nasal papillomata, low-set ears with large lobes, cardiac anomalies, redundant skin in palms and soles with prominent creases, dark skin, and propensity to certain solid tumors. HRAS mutations have been implicated in approximately 85% of the affected cases. The clinical overlap among Costello, Noonan, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes is now better understood given their common molecular background, such that all these syndromes constitute a class of disorders caused by deregulated RAS-MAPK signaling. We report on a novel KRAS gene mutation in a patient presenting the clinical features typical of Costello syndrome and the additional findings seen in Noonan syndrome. This description emphasizes that a subset of patients with Costello syndrome could harbor mutations in other genes involved in the RAS-MAPK signaling.
Streptomycin perfusion of the labyrinth is the logical choice of treatment for the third stage of Meniere's disease with intractable vertigo. The results of streptomycin perfusion of the labyrinth are comparable to those of other treatments, including endolymphatic shunt and vestibular nerve section. Refinements must be made in the process of selecting candidates for the operation. To study the factors influencing the results of streptomycin perfusion of the labyrinth, 144 patients who had streptomycin perfusion of the labyrinth and were followed for 1 year were studied using the 1972 AAOO classification of results. The findings of this study indicate that only a low dosage of streptomycin and a small volume of perfusate are required to obtain good results. Patients who have long lasting severe endolymphatic hydrops with poor hearing preoperatively are less likely to achieve good results.
Peripheral neuropathy is a rare complication of dapsone therapy. This neuropathy appears primarily to be of the motor type, and recovery occurs on discontinuation of the drug therapy. The patient in this report developed a marked motor deficit as well as a selective marked loss of vibration sense shortly after the initiation of a relatively low dose of dapsone. Recovery was rapid on cessation of the therapy. This patient was found to be a slow acetylator of isoniazid, and therefore is probably a slow acetylator of dapsone. The possible mechanisms of the neurotoxicity of dapsone and the role of altered metabolism are discussed.
We report a case of severe lingual edema and airway compromise associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are generally considered as safe drugs, angioedema may induce severe respiratory distress and death.
To define the role of vecuronium in the occurrence of bradyarrhythmia, haemodynamic changes after the induction of anaesthesia were studied in 96 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients were assigned to one of six groups according to different combinations of induction agents (etomidate 0.3 mg kg-1 or thiopentone 3 mg kg-1, with fentanyl 0.003 mg kg-1; etomidate 0.4-0.5 mg kg-1 or thiopentone 4-6 mg kg-1, without fentanyl) and neuromuscular blocking drugs (vecuronium 0.112 mg kg-1, pancuronium 0.112 mg kg-1 or suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1). Anaesthesia was maintained with enflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. After initial diverse changes, heart rate decreased in all groups. Thirty minutes after intubation, the reduction of heart rate showed statistically significant differences between the different combinations of drugs: fentanyl-etomidate-vecuronium (group I) (the largest reduction) greater than etomidate-vecuronium (II) = fentanyl-thiopentone-vecuronium (IV) greater than thiopentone-vecuronium (V) = fentanyl-thiopentone-suxamethonium (VI) = fentanyl-etomidate-pancuronium (III). Five patients in group I, two in group IV and one each in groups II and V had a heart rate slower than 45 beat min-1, whereas a similar value was never seen in groups III and VI. These results indicate that vecuronium has a bradycardic effect. This effect is more pronounced in association with etomidate than in association with thiopentone, and is augmented by the addition of fentanyl.
