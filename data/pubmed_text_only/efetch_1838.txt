The best-known adverse hematologic reaction of methimazole is agranulocytosis. Aplastic anemia is extremely rare. The prognosis within the entity of aplastic anemias is surprisingly good, despite the severe and prolonged course of the disease. The present article reports the case of a 74-yr-old female patient who exhibited aplastic anemia with severe clinical symptoms 8 weeks after the initiation of methimazole administration. The hemorrhagic symptoms were aggravated by a coumarin overdose. Supportive hemotherapy and antibiotic treatment were supplemented with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and high-dosage corticosteroids. The granulocyte count normalized on day 5 of treatment, the platelet count exceeded the critical value on day 11, and on day 25 the patient was discharged in remission.
Ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate), a hypolipidaemic drug which induces hepatomegaly and proliferation of peroxisomes in liver cells of rats and mice, was fed to 15 male F344 rats at a dietary concentration of 0.5% (v/w) for up to 28 months. Hepatocellular carcinomas developed in 10/11 (91%) rats killed between 24 and 28 months. Other tumours included carcinoma of the pancreas (2 rats), leiomyoma of the small intestine (1 rat) and a large dermatofibrosarcoma (1 rat). Clofibrate is the third hypolipidaemic peroxisome proliferator demonstrated to be hepatocarcinogenic in rats. These studies suggest that hypolipidaemic agents which are capable of producing a sustained hepatomegalic and peroxisome-proliferative effect also induce liver tumours.
Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil) are agents currently in clinical use for nonmalignant conditions. We report the use of PDE5 inhibitors as modulators of the antitumor immune response. In several mouse tumor models, PDE5 inhibition reverses tumor-induced immunosuppressive mechanisms and enables a measurable antitumor immune response to be generated that substantially delays tumor progression. In particular, sildenafil, down-regulates arginase 1 and nitric oxide synthase-2 expression, thereby reducing the suppressive machinery of CD11b+/Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) recruited by growing tumors. By removing these tumor escape mechanisms, sildenafil enhances intratumoral T cell infiltration and activation, reduces tumor outgrowth, and improves the antitumor efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy. Sildenafil also restores in vitro T cell proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiple myeloma and head and neck cancer patients. In light of the recent data that enzymes mediating MDSC-dependent immunosuppression in mice are active also in humans, these findings demonstrate a potentially novel use of PDE5 inhibitors as adjuncts to tumor-specific immune therapy.
To report a rare but severe reaction of refractory anaphylactic shock with ketoconazole treatment-associated hypotensive episodes in an elderly patient.
A 72-year-old woman received antifungal therapy for her almost completely occluded cornea infected with Candida albicans. She was initially prescribed oral ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily. She developed hypotension over the first 2 days of therapy (BP 136/82 mm Hg at baseline; 90/50 mm Hg on day 2). Severe hypotension (BP 90/49 mm Hg) unresponsive to fluid therapy or high-dose dopamine developed on day 4 of therapy. An invasive Swan-Ganz catheterization study showed a very low level of peripheral vascular resistance with high cardiac output index without clinical signs of infection. When laboratory tests showed a high level of plasma tryptase, anaphylactic redistribution shock was diagnosed. Her vital signs became more stable after treatment with hydrocortisone and epinephrine infusion. She was discharged in good condition after 24 hours of observation.
As of December 2004, refractory anaphylactic shock resulting from ketoconazole use had not been reported. The events of hypotension were strongly associated with the intake of ketoconazole. The hemodynamic results obtained with Swan-Ganz catheterization were compatible with anaphylactic shock. The Naranjo probability scale showed a probable association of the adverse event with ketoconazole.
Ketoconazole may cause severe anaphylactic shock even when taken orally. Invasive catheterization and elevated tryptase levels can provide important information in the management of anaphylactic shock.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome (type II) is associated with thromboembolic complications and a mortality rate up to 30%. We describe a patient who developed intracardiac and aortic Dacron prosthesis heparin-induced thrombosis after aortic root conservative surgery. Successive transoesophageal echocardiographies demonstrated a progressive regression of intracardiac thrombosis with oral anticoagulation by warfarin and antiplatelet therapy combining aspirin and clopidogrel.
As part of a series of short-term studies on peppermint oil constituents for their possible induction of the encephalopathy found with peppermint oil, 1,8-cineole and l-limonene were studied. Groups of 10 male Wistar rats were given 0, 500, or 1000 mg 1,8-cineole/kg body wt./day or 0, 800, or 1600 mg l-limonene/kg body wt./day for 28 days. 1,8-Cineole and l-limonene both induced accumulation of protein droplets containing alpha 2 mu-globulin in proximal tubular epithelial cells in male rats. These results suggest that both 1,8-cineole and l-limonene possibly belong to the group of chemicals characterized by their induction of excessive alpha 2 mu-globulin accumulation. Neither of the 2 substances induced encephalopathy.
To formally document the effectiveness of tegaserod as a prokinetic agent in intensive care patients.
The audit was designed in consultation with the Northern Territory Drug and Therapeutics Committee. Tegaserod was added to the feeding protocol and prokinetic algorithm in the ICU, and a prospective audit was performed of patients receiving the medication between May and September 2006.
Over the 5-month period, 40 patients received tegaserod after failing to respond to two doses of metoclopramide. Median daily volume of gastric aspirate was reduced from 1220mL in the 24 hours before tegaserod to 887.5mL in the first 24 hours after its introduction, and to 280mL in the second 24 hours (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). Tegaserod was an effective prokinetic agent in 85% (34) patients. Attributable diarrhoea occurred in 13% (5) patients, but did not require intervention.
Tegaserod is an effective alternative prokinetic agent for ICU patients with a safer side-effect profile. We believe it warrants further investigation.
In a cohort of 849 infants with an asthmatic sibling, the authors examined the relations of exposure to allergens (dust mite, cockroach, cat, and dog), nitrogen dioxide, and mold with symptoms of wheeze and persistent cough in the first year of life (1998-2000). Among infants whose mothers had physician-diagnosed asthma, neither dust mite allergen nor dog allergen was associated with either symptom. Exposure to cockroach allergen (Bla g 1 at >or=2 U/g) modestly increased the risk for wheeze (odds ratio (OR) = 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94, 3.71), and exposure to cat allergen modestly decreased the risk (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.35, 1.03). Among infants of mothers with no asthma history, exposure to gas stoves (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.15) and wood-burning stoves (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.91) increased the risk of persistent cough. Similarly, measured nitrogen dioxide concentration was associated with persistent cough (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.40). Persistent mold affected both infants of mothers with asthma (for wheeze, OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.27, 4.07; for cough, OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.22) and infants of mothers without asthma (for cough, OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.31). Reported exposure was confirmed by an association of measured fungi with wheeze (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.49). This appears to have been the first study to measure all of these home exposures (indoor allergens, nitrogen dioxide, fungi) and to prospectively measure the frequency of infant wheeze and persistent cough.
The significance of IgE antibodies to neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA)-induced anaphylactic reactions during anaesthesia is unclear. We investigated the relevance of IgE to rocuronium using an in vitro technique.
Serum samples from 61 patients with anaphylactic reactions during anaesthesia were investigated. On the basis of clinical history, allergy to NMBA was considered likely in 48 patients, further assessed using intradermal skin tests for several commonly used NMBAs, including rocuronium, vecuronium, and succinylcholine. To determine the presence of rocuronium IgE in human serum, a rocuronium-human serum albumin (rocHSA) conjugate was coupled to a solid phase and a radioallergosorbent test performed. The biological effects of patient serum NMBA-IgE on histamine release were investigated using in vitro sensitized basophils from healthy blood donors.
IgE to rocuronium was found in 23 of 48 serum samples (48%) with NMBA allergy, although only two of these were able to sensitize basophils to release histamine in response to rocHSA. IgE-responsiveness in the basophil test was only observed with conjugated rocHSA and not with unconjugated rocuronium or the other NMBAs evaluated. However, unconjugated rocuronium inhibited the histamine release induced by rocHSA. Correlation between skin-test reactivity to rocuronium and IgE to rocHSA was low (P>0.1). In contrast, striking correlation between IgE to rocuronium and skin-test reactivity to succinylcholine was found (P<0.001).
Our results indicate that NMBA-related anaphylaxis requires not only IgE NMBA reactivity, but also altered cellular reactivity in the patient. The latter may be demonstrable by testing basophils from the patient, a skin test with (steroidal) NMBA, or both.
The objective of this study was to evaluate a dual action prodrug concept wherein an unnatural myristic acid analogue is coupled via an ester moiety to the 5'-position of FLT or AZT. Subsequent intracellular cleavage of the prodrug ester would simultaneously release FLT or AZT that could inhibit reverse transcriptase (RT), and the myristic acid analogue that could inhibit myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT).
Cytotoxicity (2.2.15 cell culture), and anti-hepatitis B activity of 5'-O-myristoyl analogue prodrug derivatives of FLT and AZT (2-8) were evaluated in vitro using human liver hepatitis B virus (HBV) producing 2.2.15 cell lines.
The 5'-O-(12-methoxydodecanoyl) ester derivatives of AZT (2, EC(50) = 2. 7 +/- 0.3 microM; CC(50)= 727 +/- 19 microM) and FLT (4, EC(50)= 2.8 +/- 0.3 microM; CC(50)= 186 +/- 20 microM) were the most effective anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBV) compounds of this series in a replication assay. In the series of 5'-O-myristic acid analogue ester prodrug derivatives of FLT, the relative anti-HBV potency order was MeO(CH(2))(11)CO(2)- > N(3)(CH(2))(11)CO(2)- and Br(CH(2))(11)CO(2)- > EtS(CH(2))(n)CO(2)- (n = 10 or 11) > Me(CH(2))(12)CO(2)- (myristoyl).
The in vitro data suggest that the 5'-O-myristoyl analogue prodrug concept offers a potential drug design approach to design dual acting antiviral agents, with superior pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, reduced cytotoxicity and/or increased efficacy. In this regard, the 5'-O-(12-methoxydodecanoyl) prodrug ester of 3'-thia-3'-deoxythymidine (3TC) may offer the greatest potential for the treatment of HBV infection.
We evaluated whether verapamil (VERA) has a protective effect on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) induced by Isoproterenol (ISO) in rat.
Seventy two male adult rats were divided in four groups and treated accordingly during eight days: Control (CON), VERA (10 mg/kg), ISO (0.3 mg/kg) and VERA + ISO. It was measured in 10 animals from each group heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricle dry weight and ratio between left ventricular weight (LVW) and rat weight. Samples were taken from the left ventricle to be examined by light microscopy.
LVW of the CON group was 0.145 g, of VERA was 0.144 g, of ISO with 0.201 g, and of VERA + ISO was 0.148 g. The difference between ISO group and others was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The LVW/W ratio also showed similar result. The myocardial pattern induced by ISO was left hypertrophy and collagen content increase. In VERA + ISO group it was found a protective effect to hypertrophy (ISO group 97% vs VERA + ISO 87%; p < 0.001) and increased collagen content.
VERA prevents the deleterious effects of ISO in the myocardium. Probably this action is due to prevention the myocardial hypertrophy and proliferation of collagen tissue.
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared complication of warfarin therapy. The pathogenesis of this often-fatal complication remains obscure. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a major cause of spontaneous lobar hemorrhage in the elderly and is associated with specific alleles of the APOE gene.
To assess the role of CAA in warfarin-associated ICH.
Clinical characteristics and APOE genotype were compared between 41 patients with warfarin-related ICH (from a cohort of 59 consecutive patients aged > or = 65 years with supratentorial ICH on warfarin) and 66 randomly selected individuals aged > or = 65 years without ICH taking warfarin. In addition, all neuropathologic specimens from ICH patients were reviewed for the presence and severity of CAA.
Hemorrhages tended to be in the lobar regions of the brain, and most (76%) occurred with an international normalized ratio of < or = 3.0. The APOE epsilon2 allele was overrepresented among patients with warfarin-associated lobar hemorrhage (allele frequency 0.13 versus 0.04 in control subjects; p = 0.031). After controlling for other variables associated with ICH, carriers of the epsilon2 allele had an OR of 3.8 (95% CI, 1.0 to 14.6) for lobar ICH. CAA was pathologically diagnosed as the cause of lobar hemorrhage in 7 of 11 patients with available tissue samples.
CAA is an important cause of warfarin-associated lobar ICH in the elderly. Although diagnosis of CAA before hemorrhage is not yet possible, these data offer hope that future patients at high risk for hemorrhage may be identified before initiation of warfarin therapy.
To describe uncommon (previously unreported) types of adverse liver reactions to paracetamol.
In addition to describing patients, with uncommon types of liver reactions to paracetamol, admitted to our hospitals, we surveyed all the liver reactions to paracetamol reported to the Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee from 1973 to 1993.
The Swedish population of 8 million inhabitants.
Extensive medical evaluation.
We found one case with a cholestatic liver reaction and one with granulomatous hepatitis. The reactions were probably idiosyncratic and took several months to disappear.
In addition to the well-known dose-related toxic liver damage paracetamol may rarely cause non-dose-related severe, prolonged cholestasis or granulomatous hepatitis with cirrhosis.
A 19-year-old woman with multiple fractures and mild brain injury developed severe cerebral fat embolism syndrome after "damage control" orthopaedic surgery. Acetazolamide therapy to manage ocular trauma, in association with hyperchloraemia, caused a profound metabolic acidosis with appropriate compensatory hypocapnia. During ventilator weaning, unexpected brainstem coning followed increased sedation and brief normalisation of arterial carbon dioxide concentration. Autopsy found severe cerebral fat embolism and brain oedema. In patients with multiple trauma, cerebral fat embolism syndrome is difficult to diagnose, and may be more common after delayed fixation of long-bone fractures. Acetazolamide should be used with caution, as sudden restoration of normocapnia during compensated metabolic acidosis in patients with raised intracranial pressure may precipitate coning.
Concentrations of the hypoxic cell radiosensitizer misonidazole (MIS) and its O-demethylated metabolite Ro 05-9963 were determined in plasma (or blood), brain and tumour after injection of 1 g/kg MIS i.p. to control mice or mice pretreated with 4-6 daily injections of phenobarbitone or phenytoin. Analysis was by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Phenobarbitone and phenytoin did not alter the peak MIS concentration in plasma, brain or tumor. However, the apparent elimination half-life (t 1/2) for MIS was reduced by 20-67%, and the area under the curve (AUC) was decreased by 23-49% in plasma, brain and tumour. The decrease in MIS t 1/2 was associated with an initially increased Ro 05-9963 metabolite concentration. However, the AUC for total 2-nitromidazole (MIS + Ro 05-9963) in plasma, tumour and brain was reduced by 20-50%. Urinary excretion of MIS and its metabolites accounted for 15-42% of the injected dose, and was unaltered by pretreatment with phenobarbitone or phenytoin. Tumour/plasm and brain/plasma concentration ratios for MIS, and tumour/plasma ratios for Ro 05-9963 were very similar, but the brain/tumour ratios for Ro 05-9963 were considerably lower. Tissue/plasma ratios were unaltered by pretreatment with phenobarbitone or phenytoin. The acute LD50 for MIS was increased from 1.54 to 1.90 g/kg after phenobarbitone pretreatment and 1.78 g/kg after phenytoin pretreatment. In addition, pretreatment with either compound shortened the duration of the MIS-induced decrease in body temperature. These data suggest that pretreatment with microsomal-enzyme-inducing agents may reduce the toxicity of MIS without affecting the radiosensitization. The significance of these findings for the mechanism of MIS toxicity is also discussed.
To report a case of acute mesenteric ischemia associated with the use of oral propranolol.
A 59-year-old white man was admitted to the hospital with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. The patient was diagnosed as having hyperthyroidism. Therapy with propylthiouracil 100 mg 3 times daily and propranolol 20 mg twice daily was initiated on an outpatient basis. The following day, the patient was readmitted to our hospital with increased abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery occlusion. Antegrade aorta-mesenteric bypass surgery was performed for revascularization, and the patient was discharged 10 days after the surgery. The patient was well both clinically and endoscopically at a follow-up visit 8 months later.
Although mesenteric ischemia is a devastating illness of varied causes, drug-associated mesenteric ischemia is rarely seen. By decreasing cardiac output and selective vasodilatory receptor inhibition in the splanchnic circulation, propranolol can cause a decline in splanchnic blood flow. An objective causality assessment indicated that propranolol was the possible cause of the arterial occlusion.
Propranolol may rarely be associated with mesenteric ischemia. In cases of newly developed acute abdomen undergoing propranolol therapy, physicians should be aware of this rare and serious adverse reaction to this drug.
Recent work has demonstrated the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulation in toxic responses. In the present study, we used two rat models to investigate mRNA translation in the liver following xenobiotic-induced toxicity. By combining polysome profiling with genomic methodologies, we were able to assess global changes in hepatic mRNA translation. Dio3 (iodothyronine deiodinase type III) was identified as a gene that exhibited specific translational repression and had a functional role in a number of relevant canonical pathways. Western blot analysis indicated that this repression led to reduced D3 (the protein expressed by Dio3) levels, enhanced over time and with increased dose. Using Northern blotting techniques and qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR), we confirmed further that there was no reduction in Dio3 mRNA, suggesting that translational repression of Dio3 is an important determinant of the reduced D3 protein expression following liver damage. Finally, we show that drug-induced hepatotoxicity appears to cause localized disruptions in thyroid hormone levels in the liver and plasma. We suggest that this leads to reduced translation of Dio3 mRNA, which results in decreased D3 production. It may therefore be possible that this is an important mechanism by which the liver can, upon early signs of damage, act rapidly to maintain its own energy equilibrium, thereby avoiding global disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.
We determined the range of doses of kanamycin sulfate and ethacrynic acid that results in an ototoxic interaction in guinea pigs. In addition, we determined the time interval between the administration of the two drugs that is needed to produce this interaction. In all cases, the magnitude of the ototoxic lesion was determined by measuring the cochlea's ability to generate both the sensitivity and intensity functions of the ac cochlear potential. In addition, the cochlear pathologic conditions, as determined by counting the number of missing hair cells in the organ of Corti, was found to correlate highly with the ac cochlear potential data. The dosage range of ethacrynic acid during which the interaction occurs is very narrow, while the dose range of kanamycin is very large.
Genetic polymorphism G894T on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene has been associated with endothelial dysfunction in young smokers, but its role in the pathogenesis of MI is obscure. We examined the effect of G894T polymorphism on endothelial function, on markers of endothelial cells injury and activation such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) and on serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 1b (IL-1b), in young myocardial infarction (MI) survivors.
The study population consisted of 56 patients with a history of premature MI. The forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured by using strain-gauge plethysmography during reactive hyperemia and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin. G894T polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), while plasma vWF and serum IL1b and IL-6 levels were determined with ELISA.
There was no significant difference in resting FBF and in the responses to nitroglycerin between the genotypes. However, the presence of T allele (GT+TT, n=35) was associated with decreased FBF during reactive hyperemia (10.23+/-0.70 ml/100ml tissue/min) and decreased forearm vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia (54.28+/-4.81%) compared to GG (13.82+/-0.92 ml/100 ml tissue/min and 83.92+/-9.89% respectively, p<0.01 for both). Carriers of the T allele had also higher levels of vWF (79.66+/-5.56%) compared to GG (60.94+/-5.27% p<0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in IL-1b and IL-6 serum levels between the genotypes (p=ns for both).
The presence of 894T allele on eNOS gene is associated with impaired endothelial function and higher levels of von Willebrand factor in relatively young patients with myocardial infarction. This finding implies that genetic polymorphism G894T on eNOS may affect endothelial function in patients with a history of premature myocardial infarction.
To report a probable interaction between meropenem and valproic acid that resulted in the development of epileptic seizures.
A 21-year-old woman presented to our emergency department because of a new-onset, generalized tonic-clonic seizure and was admitted to the intensive care unit. Treatment with valproic acid 1000 mg as a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours was initiated. On day 6, the serum concentration of valproic acid was 52.5 microg/mL. On day 13, treatment with intravenous meropenem 1 g 3 times daily was started. On day 15, when the patient was afebrile, numerous myoclonic episodes occurred involving her arms and face; the serum concentration of valproic acid at that time was 42 mug/mL. The valproic acid dose was increased to 2880 mg. Two days later, a generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred despite the increased dosage, and the plasma concentration of valproic acid fell to 7 microg/mL. The valproic acid dose was increased the following day to 3600 mg; however, the serum concentrations remained <10 microg/mL. On day 19, based on the results of a blood culture and the suspicion of an interaction between meropenem and valproic acid, meropenem therapy was suspended. The serum concentration of valproic acid was 52.4 microg/mL on day 27. Three days later, the patient was asymptomatic and was discharged.
Coadministration of valproic acid and other drugs that are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system can lead to clinically relevant interactions by induction or inhibition of enzymes in shared metabolic pathways. In view of studies in experimental models, the interaction between carbapenem antibiotics and valproic acid is at least possible. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between acute seizures and a meropenem-valproic acid interaction in this patient.
This case report provides strong evidence for an interaction between valproic acid and meropenem. Clinicians should be aware of this potential interaction that may be associated with a serious adverse effect as the result of the decrease of the valproic acid serum concentrations.
Nuclear medicine studies found decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the cortex and deep gray matter of cocaine users. Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a non-radioactive technique, has not been applied to evaluate persistent rCBF abnormalities. Twenty-five abstinent cocaine users and 15 healthy subjects without a history of drug use were examined with perfusion MRI, using dynamic bolus-tracking, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), using 133Xe-calibrated 99mTc-HMPAO. After coregistration of SPECT with MRI, the relative rCBF (from perfusion MRI and SPECT) and absolute rCBF (from SPECT) were determined in 10 brain regions in each hemisphere. There was a statistically significant interaction between drug use and brain region on SPECT alone (relative and absolute rCBF), and on SPECT and perfusion MRI combined, but not on perfusion MRI alone. There also was a significant interaction among gender, drug use, and brain region. Compared to the control subjects, cocaine users showed increased rCBF in the frontal white matter (+8.6%, P=0.02) and in the globus pallidus (+6.3%, P=0.05), and decreased rCBF in the putamen (-3.9%, P=0.04) and the temporal cortex (-2.4%, P=0.02). SPECT and perfusion MRI detect a regional pattern of rCBF abnormalities in cocaine users that is consistent across the two methods. The hypoperfusion in the cortex and deep gray matter of the cocaine users is consistent with previous results. The increased rCBF in the white matter of cocaine users may be due to the presence of reactive glia.
Aberrant expression of Eph and ephrin proteins has well-established functions in oncogenesis and tumour progression. We describe EphA1 expression in 6 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, 18 controls and 125 CRC specimens. In addition, a well-characterised cohort of 53 paired normal colon and CRCs was also assessed. Expression of EphA1 mRNA was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and correlated with protein expression by flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Significant upregulation (2- to 10-fold) of EphA1 was seen in over 50% of cases (P=0.005) whereas many of the remainder showed downregulation of EphA1. Intriguingly, EphA1 over-expression was more prevalent in stage II compared to stage III CRCs (P=0.02). Low EphA1 expression significantly correlated with poor survival (P=0.02). Epigenetic silencing appeared to explain the loss of EphA1 expression as methylation of the EphA1 CpG island strongly correlated with low EphA1 expression (P<0.01). Furthermore, EphA1 re-expression could be induced by treatment with demethylating agents. Our findings identify EphA1 as a potential prognostic marker in CRC. Although therapies targeting high EphA1 expression seem plausible in CRC, the loss of expression in advanced disease suggests a potential risk that targeted therapy, by selecting for loss of expression, might contribute to disease progression.
To investigate the relationship between gene polymorphism of CYP2E1, CYP1A1, IL-4 and susceptibility of medicamentosa-like dermatitis induced by trichloroethylene (TCE).
35 patients with medicamentosa-like dermatitis induced by TCE were chosen as the patient group, and 35 healthy workers as control group. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TaqMan minor groove binding (MGB) probes was used to test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of CYP2E1, CYP1A1 and IL-4 in the patients with medicamentosa-like dermatitis as well as in the control. The genotypes and the frequency of genotype or allele were compared between the patients and control with statistical analysis.
The frequency of allele G within CYP1A1 gene (rs1048943) was significantly higher in TCE patients (37.1%) than that in control (P<0.05); the frequency of allele T within CYP2E1-1053 C/T was significantly higher in TCE patients (41.4%) than that in control (P<0.01); the frequency of T/T within IL-4-588 C/T (rs2243250) was significantly higher in TCE patients (75.0%) than that in control (P<0.01), and the frequency of allele T within IL-4-588 C/T (rs2243250) was also significantly higher in TCE patients (87.5%) than that in control (P<0.01).
The gene polymorphism of CYP2E1, CYP1A1, IL-4 is probably associated with hypersensitivity for the TCE patients with medicamentosa-like dermatitis, and could be one of the genetic factors related to the individual susceptibility to TCE exposure.
Clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) of the vagina and cervix in young women is associated with prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES). Parenchymal pulmonary metastases are known to occur following treatment of the primary tumor. Most recurrences present within 2 to 3 years of the initial diagnosis.
This is a case report of a solitary endobronchial clear cell adenocarcinoma occurring 15.3 years after the initial diagnosis of DES-induced CCA.
This case suggests that management of clear cell cancer survivors should involve long-term follow-up because of the potential for the appearance of a new focus of clear cell adenocarcinoma.
We report a case of ventricular chaotic arrhythmia after droperidol administration. A 49-year-old woman with chronic renal failure receiving hemodialysis, was scheduled for total hysterectomy under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with thiopental 200 mg, fentanyl 0.1 mg and vecuronium 5 mg for endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with 1% isoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Droperidol 10 mg was injected for neuroleptanalgesia. After two minutes, ventricular chaotic arrhythmia occurred. Lidocaine 80 mg was injected. General anesthesia was stopped. After two minutes, arrhythmia disappeared. Several reports suggest that patients with preexisting conduction defects or prolonged QTc interval may be at risk to develop ventricular arrhythmias after droperidol administration. Administration of droperidol may have exaggerated prolongation of QTc interval.
A female swimming instructor was seen with chronic bilateral shoulder pain and loss of range of motion. Intensive physical therapy significantly improved the range of motion but did not alleviate the pain. Osteopathic manipulative treatment produced no further improvement in pain or function. Results of laboratory tests were all within normal limits. Four months after the initial consultation, the patient, who was taking medication for tonic/clonic seizures, recalled that her symptoms began after her anticonvulsant medication was switched from hydantoin sodium to phenobarbital. Therefore, phenobarbital-induced fibromyalgia was diagnosed. In 4 months, pain had completely disappeared. The authors discuss several theories regarding the cause of fibromyalgia and the mechanism of action of phenobarbital, including its relationship to sleep disturbance, a probable contributor to pain and dysfunction in the patient described.
