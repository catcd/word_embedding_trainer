Theophylline has been shown to be a potent cardiovascular teratogen in animals, but there has been no evidence linking theophylline with congenital anomalies in infants. The cardiovascular anomalies in our three patients were aortic anomalies, double-outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and hypoplasia of the left ventricle. Some of these rare defects were also induced frequently in animal experiments with theophylline, which suggests that this drug can be a cardiovascular teratogen in a susceptible human fetus.
To examine the roles of endogenous K-ras 4A and K-ras 4B splice variants in tumorigenesis, murine lung carcinogenesis was induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), which causes a K-ras mutation (G12D) that jointly affects both isoforms. Compared with age-matched K-ras(tmDelta4A/-) mice (where tumours can express mutationally activated K-ras 4B only), tumour number and size were significantly higher in K-ras(+/-) mice (where tumours can also express mutationally activated K-ras 4A), and significantly lower in K-ras(tmDelta4A/tmDelta4A) mice (where tumours can express both wild-type and activated K-ras 4B). MNU induced significantly more, and larger, tumours in wild-type than K-ras(tmDelta4A/tmDelta4A) mice which differ in that only tumours in wild-type mice can express wild-type and activated K-ras 4A. Lung tumours in all genotypes were predominantly papillary adenomas, and tumours from K-ras(+/-) and K-ras(tmDelta4A/-) mice exhibited phospho-Erk1/2 and phospho-Akt staining. Hence (1) mutationally activated K-ras 4B is sufficient to activate the Raf/MEK/ERK(MAPK) and PI3-K/Akt pathways, and initiate lung tumorigenesis, (2) when expressed with activated K-ras 4B, mutationally activated K-ras 4A further promotes lung tumour formation and growth (both in the presence and absence of its wild-type isoform) but does not affect either tumour pathology or progression, and (3) wild-type K-ras 4B, either directly or indirectly, reduces tumour number and size.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are extensively involved in diverse biological processes. However, very little is known about the role of miRNAs in mediating the action of thyroid hormones (TH). Appropriate TH levels are known to be critically important for development, differentiation and maintenance of metabolic balance in mammals. We induced transient hypothyroidism in juvenile mice by short-term exposure to methimazole and perchlorate from post natal day (PND) 12 to 15. The expression of miRNAs in the liver was analyzed using Taqman Low Density Arrays (containing up to 600 rodent miRNAs). We found the expression of 40 miRNAs was significantly altered in the livers of hypothyroid mice compared to euthyroid controls. Among the miRNAs, miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b exhibited a massive increase in expression (50- to 500-fold). The regulation of TH on the expression of miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b was confirmed in various mouse models including: chronic hypothyroid, short-term hyperthyroid and short-term hypothyroid followed by TH supplementation. TH regulation of these miRNAs was also confirmed in mouse hepatocyte AML 12 cells. The expression of precursors of miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b were examined in AML 12 cells and shown to decrease after TH treatment, only pre-mir-206 and pre-mir-133b reached statistical significance. To identify the targets of these miRNAs, DNA microarrays were used to examine hepatic mRNA levels in the short-term hypothyroid mouse model relative to controls. We found transcripts from 92 known genes were significantly altered in these hypothyroid mice. Web-based target predication software (TargetScan and Microcosm) identified 14 of these transcripts as targets of miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b. The vast majority of these mRNA targets were significantly down-regulated in hypothyroid mice, corresponding with the up-regulation of miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b in hypothyroid mouse liver. To further investigate target genes, miR-206 was over-expressed in AML 12 cells. TH treatment of cells over-expressing miR-206 resulted in decreased miR-206 expression, and a significant increase in two predicted target genes, Mup1 and Gpd2. The results suggest that TH regulation of these genes may occur secondarily via miR-206. These studies provide new insight into the role of miRNAs in mediating TH regulation of gene expression.
The authors report a presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutation (L113P) in a family with six cases of dementia. The patients had personality changes and behavioral disorders, whereas spatial orientation and praxis were preserved late in the course of the illness. Neuroimaging features were consistent with the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. The authors conclude that PSEN1 mutations can be associated with clinical features of frontotemporal dementia.
Muscle pain associated with single-bolus administration of suxamethonium is reported to be one of the common complications of this technique. Since suxamethonium is the most commonly used relaxant in our department and priming with nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is also reported to be linked with complications, while the literature concerning this problem is very contradictory, we wondered if the so-called "self-taming" method represents an alternative to pretreatment with nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. One hundred thirty-two patients (69 male, 63 female) were randomly allocated to three groups. Anesthesia was induced with thiopentone 7 mg/kg body weight. Group 1 (n = 44) was pretreated with 2 mg pancuronium bromide 3 min prior to full relaxation with suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Group 2 (n = 43) received no pretreatment. Group 3 (n = 45) received 4 mg suxamethonium i.v. after induction. One minute later the remaining dose of suxamethonium was applied ("self-taming"). Muscle fasciculation and postoperative myalgia were verified by means of a score. Neuromuscular transmission was recorded on a monitor after controlled train-of-four stimulus and time of onset of neuromuscular blockade was measured. With regard to muscle fasciculation, postoperative pain, and onset of neuromuscular blockade, "self-taming" with suxamethonium yielded results identical to pretreatment with pancuronium bromide. It may therefore be considered as an alternative to pretreatment with nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.
Medical or surgical castration is effective in advanced prostate cancer but with profound side-effects, particularly on sexual function. Effective, less toxic therapies are needed. This study examined whether the addition of finasteride to high-dose bicalutamide enhanced disease control, as measured by additional decreases in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).
Forty-one patients with advanced prostate cancer received bicalutamide (150 mg/day). Finasteride (5 mg/day) was added at first PSA nadir. Serum PSA was measured every 2 weeks until disease progression. Questionnaires were administered to assess sexual function.
Median follow-up is 3.9 years. At the first PSA nadir, median decrease in PSA from baseline was 96.5%. Thirty of 41 patients (73%) achieved a second PSA nadir and median decrease of 98.5% from baseline. Median time to each nadir was 3.7 and 5.8 weeks, respectively. Median time to treatment failure was 21.3 months. Toxicities were minor, including gynecomastia. Seventeen of 29 (59%) and 12 of 24 (50%) men had normal sex drive at baseline and at second PSA nadir, respectively. One-third of men had spontaneous erection at both time points.
Finasteride provides additional intracellular androgen blockade when added to bicalutamide. Duration of control is comparable to castration, with preserved sexual function in some patients.
Since the approval of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke, great interest has been generated in cerebral fibrinolysis. Our purpose was to assess long-term outcome and hemorrhagic risk in patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke treated with intraarterial urokinase.
Twenty-six patients were treated within 6 hours of ictus; of these, 21 were followed up for an average of 23 months. Angiographic reperfusion was classified according to thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grades. The Rankin Scale (RS) and the modified Barthel Index (mod BI) were used as outcome measures (good outcome: RS = 0-2, mod BI = 16-20; poor outcome: RS = 3-5, mod BI < or = 15).
Ten of the 21 patients (average age, 48 years) had a good outcome; three (average age, 71 years) had a poor outcome; eight patients (average age, 78 years) died. Partial/complete (successful) recanalization was observed in 11 of 26 patients and minimal or no (unsuccessful) recanalization in 15. Recanalization favored a better outcome: nine of 21 had successful recanalization, with a good outcome in seven; 12 of 21 had unsuccessful reperfusion, with poor outcome/death in nine. Poor outcome was noted in five patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation occlusions, four of whom had unsuccessful recanalization and poor outcome or death. Hemorrhage occurred in 10 of the 26 patients, with clinical deterioration in three. The average dose of urokinase was higher in the hemorrhage group, and mortality was higher in patients who hemorrhaged.
Intraarterial thrombolysis is feasible in the setting of acute stroke. Successful reperfusion is associated with a better outcome, and the prevalence of hemorrhage does not exceed that which occurs in the natural history of embolic stroke. Poor outcome or death is associated with nonrecanalization, older age, hemorrhage, and ICA bifurcation occlusions.
In vivo magnetic resonance studies have found that cocaine dependence is associated with T2 signal hyperintensities and metabolite abnormalities in cerebral white matter (WM). Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that chronic cocaine use is primarily associated with frontal lobe deficits in regional cerebral blood flow and brain glucose metabolism levels; however, the effects of cocaine dependence, if any, on frontal WM microstructure are unknown. Thus, we sought to examine the effects of cocaine dependence on frontal WM integrity.
Diffusion tensor imaging was employed to examine the WM integrity of frontal regions at four levels: 10 mm above, 5 mm above, 0 mm above, and 5 mm below the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) plane. The fractional anisotropy (FA) of 12 cocaine-dependent patients and 13 age-similar control subjects was compared.
The cocaine-dependent patients had significantly reduced FA in the frontal WM at the AC-PC plane and a trend toward reduced FA at 5 mm below the AC-PC plane, suggestive of reduced WM integrity in these regions.
These findings were consistent with the hypothesis that cocaine dependence involves alterations in orbitofrontal connectivity, which may be involved in the decision-making deficits seen in this disorder.
Studies to assess the effects of inhaled ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) on embryonal and fetal development were conducted on groups of Fischer 344 rats, CF-1 mice, and New Zealand White rabbits. Rabbits and rats were exposed to vapor concentrations of 0, 3, 10, or 50 ppm for 6 hr/day on Days 6 through 18, or Days 6 through 15 of gestation, respectively; mice were exposed to 0, 10, or 50 ppm on Days 6 through 15 of gestation. Exposure of pregnant rabbits to 50 ppm produced significant increases in the incidence of malformations, minor variations, and resorptions, as well as a decrease in fetal body weight. Rats and mice exposed to 50 ppm showed no evidence of a teratogenic effect, although indications of slight fetotoxicity were observed in both species. Transient decreases in maternal body weight gain among rats, mice, and rabbits exposed to 50 ppm were the only consistent signs of maternal effects. No significant treatment-related effects on fetal development were observed in any of the species tested at 10 ppm of EGME or below.
Intrathecal baclofen therapy is increasingly used to alleviate medically intractable spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries, and generalized dystonia. Complications like overdose or withdrawal can occur and could be the result of pump malfunction (device-related) or refilling and programming mistakes (human errors). This report describes a case, with emphasis on electroencephalographic changes, of a 12-year old male on long-term intrathecal baclofen therapy who had sequential occurrence of both acute inadvertent baclofen overdose followed by withdrawal symptoms. During baclofen intoxication, electroencephalography documented periodic generalized epileptiform discharges, occasionally followed by intermittent electro-decremental responses on a background of diffuse delta slowing (1-2 Hz). During withdrawal, mild generalized slowing during wakefulness was observed along with the appearance of high-amplitude, sharply contoured delta activity resembling frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity in sleep. To our knowledge, this temporal profile of electroencephalographic features during baclofen intoxication followed by withdrawal has not been described before in pediatric patients. It is important for treating physicians to recognize the evolution of this electroencephalographic pattern in order to avoid misinterpretation of diagnosis and prognosis.
Several lines of evidence suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a radiosensitizing effect on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, but little is known about the underlying cellular mechanism. In this study, we found that the treatment with the NSAID nimesulide significantly increased the sensitivity of A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells to radiotherapy. The combined nimesulide-radiation treatment increased apoptosis, induced the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activated caspase-8, and induced cleavage of Bid. A pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, suppressed this increase in apoptosis and also suppressed the cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP, suggesting a caspase-dependent mechanism. In addition, z-IETD-fmk, a selective caspase-8 inhibitor, suppressed the nimesulide- and radiation-induced cleavage activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-8, and Bid, and suppressed the concomitant apoptosis, indicating that the nimesulide-induced increase in radiosensitivity was initiated by caspase-8. However, the caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk failed to suppress activation of the caspase-8/Bid pathway, indicating that caspase-3 activation occurred downstream of caspase-8 activation in our experiments. Marked antitumor effects, which were evaluated by measuring protracted tumor regression, were observed when nude mice were treated with a combination of nimesulide at a clinically achievable dose (0.5 mg/kg) and radiation therapy. Our results, demonstrating the radiosensitivity-increasing and tumor growth-inhibiting effects of nimesulide, suggest that nimesulide may be suitable as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy and selectivity of radiotherapy.
Involvement of the serotonergic system in tail tremor induced by repeated administration of nicotine was investigated in rats. Tail tremor induced by nicotine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) was suppressed by a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, N-¿2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl-]ethyl¿-N-(2-pyridinyl)cycloh exanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY-100635; 0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.), but not by a 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist, ketanserin (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.p). The 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists, buspirone (1-20 mg/kg, i.p.), gepirone (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.), tandospirone (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) and (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.01-0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), enhanced the tail tremor. The enhancement of tail tremor by buspirone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was blocked by WAY-100635 (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.). These findings suggest that nicotine-induced tail tremor is mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors and that 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of tremor.
This case study highlights the important contribution of nursing in obtaining an accurate health history. The case discussed herein initially appeared to be neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) secondary to a traumatic brain injury. The nursing staff, by reviewing the patient's health history with his family, discovered a history of polydipsia and long-standing lithium use. Lithium is implicated in drug-induced nephrogenic DI, and because the patient had not received lithium since being admitted to the hospital, his treatment changed to focus on nephrogenic DI. By combining information from the patient history, the physical examination, and radiologic and laboratory studies, the critical care team demonstrated that the patient had been self-treating his lithium-induced nephrogenic DI and developed neurogenic DI secondary to brain trauma. Thus successful treatment required that nephrogenic and neurogenic DI be treated concomitantly.
Two patients developed cirrhosis of the liver following therapy with perhexiline maleate. Liver failure and polyneuropathy caused death in one patient who had received 300 mg daily for three years. Cirrhosis was an unexpected finding in the other patient whose perhexiline dose was 200 mg daily for five years. Perhexiline should be prescribed cautiously and discontinued if liver function tests become abnormal. Monitoring of blood levels may lead to a reduction of toxicity.
The effects of oral administration of Hochu-ekki-to (HET; bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang in Chinese), a traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicine, on chronic contact hypersensitivity were investigated. HET suppressed ear swelling due to chronic contact hypersensitivity caused by repeated application of 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB). HET significantly suppressed not only increases in hapten-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG1 titer due to repeated application of TNCB, but also total IgE and IgG1 concentration in the serum. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) level in inflamed ear tissue was significantly increased by repeated application of TNCB, and this increase in IL-4 level in the ear was significantly suppressed by oral administration of HET. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-2, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-12 levels are not changed as much as IL4 by TNCB and HET did not alter these cytokines as much as IL-4. These results suggest that oral administration of HET suppresses chronic contact hypersensitivity, and it can be assumed that the suppression of serum Ig E and Ig G1 and IL-4 in inflamed ear.
To classify the headache syndromes under treatment with calcineurin inhibitors and to investigate whether the latter influence the nitric oxide production of human brain microvascular cells (HBMEC).
Single cases of cyclosporine-induced headaches have been reported. Since calcineurin inhibitors are known to influence the renal metabolism of NO, a key molecule in tension-type headache and migraine, we were interested whether calcineurin inhibitors might change NO metabolism in HBMEC as well.
Headache symptoms of 74 patients receiving cyclosporine and/or tacrolimus for organ transplantation were retrospectively assessed. Furthermore, the effect of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on nitric oxide production in human brain microvascular endothelial cells was investigated after incubation.
Only 18 of the 74 patients reported no headache 1-36 months after liver, lung, or bone-marrow transplantation, 28 reported a new headache, and 17 an increase in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing headache. The headache was generally classified as migraine without aura (IHS 1.1) or migraine-like headache (IHS 1.6). Furthermore, we found significantly increased NO production after co-incubation of calcineurin inhibitors with human brain microvascular endothelial cells.
The pathophysiological mechanism of these headaches may be connected with an endothelial dysfunction in terms of increased production of NO.
Melatonin is an indoleamine secreted by the pineal gland as well as a plant-derived product, and resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring polyphenol synthesized by a variety of plant species; both molecules act as a neuroprotector and antioxidant. Recent studies have demonstrated that RSV reduced the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and stroke, while melatonin supplementation was found to reduce the progression of the cognitive impairment in AD. The heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible and redox-regulated enzyme that provides tissue-specific antioxidant effects. We assessed whether the co-administration of melatonin and RSV shows synergistic effects in terms of their neuroprotective properties through HO-1. RSV significantly increased the expression levels of HO-1 protein in a concentration-dependent manner both in primary cortical neurons and in astrocytes, while melatonin per se did not. Melatonin + RSV showed a synergistic increase in the expression levels of HO-1 protein but not in the HO-1 mRNA level compared to either melatonin or RSV alone, which is mediated by the activation of PI3K-Akt pathway. Treatment of melatonin + RSV significantly attenuated the neurotoxicity induced by H(2) O(2) in primary cortical neurons and also in organotypic hippocampal slice culture. The blockade of HO-1 induction by shRNA attenuated HO-1 induction by melatonin + RSV and hindered the neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress induced by H(2) O(2) . The treatment of MG132 + RSV mimicked the effects of melatonin + RSV, and melatonin + RSV inhibited ubiquitination of HO-1. These data suggest that melatonin potentiates the neuroprotective effect of RSV against oxidative injury, by enhancing HO-1 induction through inhibiting ubiquitination-dependent proteasome pathway, which may provide an effective means to treat neurodegenerative disorders.
A young patient experienced marked sinus tachycardia while smoking marijuana and receiving therapeutic doses of nortriptyline. The authors discuss the potential synergistic effects of these drugs and recommend treatment with propranolol.
To determine whether (1) tailored nicotine patch therapy that is based on smoking rate can be carried out in a multisite oncology investigative group practice setting, (2) long-term use of bupropion reduces the rate of relapse to smoking in smokers who stop smoking with nicotine patch therapy, and (3) bupropion can initiate smoking abstinence among smokers who have failed to stop smoking after nicotine patch therapy.
Fourteen North Central Cancer Treatment Group sites recruited generally healthy adult smokers from the general population for nicotine patch therapy and based the patch dosage on smoking rates. At completion of nicotine patch therapy, nonsmoking participants were eligible to be assigned to bupropion or placebo for 6 months (for relapse prevention). and smoking participants were eligible to be assigned to bupropion or placebo for 8 weeks of treatment.
Of 578 subjects, 31% were abstinent from smoking at the end of nicotine patch therapy. Of those subjects not smoking at the end of nicotine patch therapy who entered the relapse prevention phase, 28% and 25% were not smoking at 6 months (the end of the medication phase) for bupropion and placebo, respectively (P =.73). For those still smoking at the end of nicotine patch therapy, 3.1% and 0.0% stopped smoking with bupropion or placebo, respectively (P =.12).
Tailored nicotine patch therapy for the general population of smokers can be provided in a multisite oncology investigative group setting. Bupropion did not reduce relapse to smoking in smokers who stopped smoking with nicotine patch therapy. Bupropion did not initiate abstinence among smokers who failed to stop smoking with nicotine patch therapy.
We investigated the effects of 7-hydroxy-fluphenazine and fluphenazine-sulfoxide, main metabolites of fluphenazine (FZ), on behavior of mice and rats. These metabolites inhibited open-field behavior and methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity, lowered body temperature, and elicited catalepsy in mice, as did FZ-2HCl, FZ-enanthate and FZ-decanoate. After intramuscular administration, the onset of action of FZ-enanthae, FZ-decanoate and their metabolites was somewhat delayed compared to findings with FZ-2HCl, and the duration of FZ-enanthate and FZ-decanoate lasted longer than that of FZ-2HCl and metabolites. FZ-metabolites decreased stereotypy induced by a high dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.) of apomorphine and yawning elicitedby a low dose (0.25 mg/kg i.p.) of apomorphine in rats. The results suggest that 7-hydroxy-FZ and FZ-sulfoxide exert their psychotropic actions by blocking pre- and postsynaptic dopamine receptors and that formation of active metabolite may affect theprolonged therapeutic action of depot-type preparations of FZ.
Acylfulvenes (AFs), a class of semisynthetic analogues of the sesquiterpene natural product illudin S, are cytotoxic toward cancer cells. The minor structural changes between illudin S and AFs translate to an improved therapeutic window in preclinical cell-based assays and xenograft models. AFs are, therefore, unique tools for addressing the chemical and biochemical basis of cytotoxic selectivity. AFs elicit cytotoxic responses by alkylation of biological targets, including DNA. While AFs are capable of direct alkylation, cytosolic reductive bioactivation to an electrophilic intermediate is correlated with enhanced cytotoxicity. Data obtained in this study illustrate chemical aspects of the process of AF activation. By tracking reaction mechanisms with stable isotope-labeled reagents, enzymatic versus chemical activation pathways for AF were compared for reactions involving the NADPH-dependent enzyme prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1) or sodium borohydride, respectively. These two processes resulted in isomeric products that appear to give rise to similar patterns of DNA modification. The chemically activated isomer has been newly isolated and chemically characterized in this study, including an assessment of its relative stereochemistry and stability at varying pH and under bioassay conditions. In mammalian cancer cells, this chemically activated analogue was shown to not rely on further cellular activation to significantly enhance cytotoxic potency, in contrast to the requirements of AF. On the basis of this study, we anticipate that the chemically activated form of AF will serve as a useful chemical probe for evaluating biomolecular interactions independent of enzyme-mediated activation.
The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of the immunosuppressant rapamycin (Rapamune, Sirolimus) on both resistance vessel responsiveness and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient 8-week-old male mice fed a normal rodent diet. Norepinephrine (NE)-induced vasoconstriction, acetylcholine (ACh)- and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced vasorelaxation of isolated mesenteric bed, and atherosclerotic lesions were evaluated. After 12 weeks of orally administered rapamycin (5 mg.kg-1.day-1, N = 9) and compared with untreated (control, N = 9) animals, rapamycin treatment did not modify either NE-induced vasoconstriction (maximal response: 114 +/- 4 vs 124 +/- 10 mmHg, respectively) or ACh- (maximal response: 51 +/- 8 vs 53 +/- 5%, respectively) and SNP-induced vasorelaxation (maximal response: 73 +/- 6 vs 74 +/- 6%, respectively) of the isolated vascular mesenteric bed. Despite increased total cholesterol in treated mice (982 +/- 59 vs 722 +/- 49 mg/dL, P < 0.01), lipid deposition on the aorta wall vessel was significantly less in rapamycin-treated animals (37 +/- 12 vs 68 +/- 8 microm(2) x 10(3)). These results indicate that orally administered rapamycin is effective in attenuating the progression of atherosclerotic plaque without affecting the responsiveness of resistance vessels, supporting the idea that this immunosuppressant agent might be of potential benefit against atherosclerosis in patients undergoing therapy.
Thyroid destruction leading to endemic myxoedematous cretinism is highly prevalent in central Africa, where iodine (I) and selenium (SE) deficiencies as well as thiocyanate (SCN) overload are combined. All three factors have been studied experimentally in the etiology of the disease, but they have never been studied in combination. In a model using rats, we have previously shown that combining I and SE deficiencies increases the sensitivity of the thyroid to necrosis after iodide overload, an event unlikely to occur in the African situation. To develop a model that would more closely fit with the epidemiological findings, we have determined whether an SCN overload would also result in thyroid necrosis as does the I overload. The combination of the three factors increased by 3.5 times the amount of necrotic cells, from 5.5 +/- 0.3% in the I-SE+ thyroids to 18.9 +/- 1.6% in the I-SE-SCN-overloaded ones. Methimazole administration prevented the SCN-induced necrosis. SE- thyroids evolved to fibrosis, whereas SE+ thyroids did not. TGFbeta was prominent in macrophages present in SE- glands. Thyroid destruction in central Africa might therefore originate from the interaction of three factors: I and SE deficiencies by increasing H(2)O(2) accumulation, SE deficiency by decreasing cell defense and promoting fibrosis, and SCN overload by triggering follicular cell necrosis.
Three cases managed with class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs but with subsequent aggravation of arrhythmias are reported herein. A 58-year-old man given 300 mg of flecainide for atrial flutter developed sinus arrest and transient ventricular fibrillation. A 42-year-old man with a postoperative condition of tetralogy of Fallot who received 300-mg doses of flecainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia had spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia. A 74-year-old man given 150 mg of propafenone for atrial tachycardia developed sustained ventricular tachycardia. The present cases illustrate that class Ic drugs may exacerbate ventricular arrhythmias, and their use may reveal concealed sinus node dysfunction. This may be due to marked slowing of conduction and prolonged ventricular refractoriness, which are characteristic of the class Ic drugs; also, it is probable that the patients' underlying cardiac conditions served as contributing factors.
Amsacrine is an aminoacridine that binds to DNA by intercalation. Because amsacrine interferes with DNA synthesis it has potent genotoxic and cytotoxic properties. To define its tumorigenic nature, amsacrine was studied in a 104-week carcinogenicity bioassay using Wistar rats. Treatment regimen consisted of 6 cycles of intravenous administration over 5 consecutive days followed by 23 days without drug to allow for recovery from cytotoxicity. Doses were 0.25, 1 and 3 mg/kg. At 3 mg/kg mortality was excessive reaching 100% of males by Week 90 and 96% of females at Week 104. Deaths were associated with either tumor induction or cytotoxicity. Multisystemic tumor development manifested in a dose-related fashion. The incidence of small intestinal adenocarcinomas was particularly striking owing to the rarity of these neoplasia in Wistar rats. Small intestinal adenocarcinomas that were well-differentiated presented as pedunculated masses or were sessile masses derived from flat mucosa. Mucin-secreting adenocarcinomas showed poorly-differentiated histologic pattern with absence of crypt or villus structures. We postulate that they are variants of the neoplasia derived from flat mucosa wherein the loss of histologic architecture is the sequela of protracted secretion and accumulation of mucin leading ultimately to extensive tumor remodeling. As amsacrine is primarily excreted in bile, direct exposure to this genotoxic agent was a probable factor in tumorigenesis like small intestinal carcinogens such as 1,2-dimethylhydrazine and azoxymethane.
