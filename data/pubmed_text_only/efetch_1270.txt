Baclofen, a derivate of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), is known to be a useful drug in spasticity treatment. To achieve a good therapeutic response higher oral dosages have to be administered related with central side effects. Intrathecal application of Baclofen in microgram range dosages is proved to be effective in spinal spasticity. The efficiency of intrathecal Baclofen in patients suffering from supraspinal spasticity is discussed controversially. We report on 9 patients with long-term intrathecal Baclofen treatment, all of them responding well presenting a marked reduced muscle tone. In most cases an improvement of motor performance and in two cases improved bladder function was observed. The therapeutical dosages administered to patients with supraspinal spasticity exceed those administered to patients with spinal spasticity by approximately 100% without provoking central side effects. Despite the risks connected with this method it has to be considered as treatment of choice in cases of severe supraspinal spasticity.
A 33-year-old male presented with end-stage renal failure. Renal biopsy showed severe interstitial fibrosis without glomerulopathy or vasculopathy. More than 10 years previously the patient had been successfully treated for recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma. The treatment included ifosfamide, a drug known to cause acute tubular dysfunction. Though a possible synergistic effect of previous radiation which was well within accepted tolerance limits cannot be excluded, it would appear that ifosfamide was almost certainly the major cause of the late onset chronic renal disease.
The possible onset of cardiotoxic manifestations during chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was evaluated in 1083 patients treated with the drug for various kinds of neoplasm. We recognized 17 cases of 5-FU cardiopathy (usually anginous crises but also myocardial infarction). The comprehensive incidence was 1.6%, with a significantly greater risk (4.5% vs 1.1%) for patients with a positive anamnesis of previous cardiopathy. On the contrary, age and combination with other antiblastic drugs had no affect on the appearance of cardiopathy. We conclude that 5-FU cardiopathy, although rare, has to be taken into account in oncologic practice, chiefly in those patients already affected with cardiac diseases.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a serious unmet medical need. Despite high remission rates with chemotherapy standard-of-care treatment, the disease eventually relapses in a major proportion of patients. Activating Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations are found in approximately 30% of patients with AML. Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has shown encouraging results in treating FLT3-mutated AML. Responses, however, are not sustained and acquired resistance has been a clinical challenge. Treatment options to overcome resistance are currently the focus of research. We report here the preclinical evaluation of AMG 925, a potent, selective, and bioavailable FLT3/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) dual kinase inhibitor. AMG 925 inhibited AML xenograft tumor growth by 96% to 99% without significant body weight loss. The antitumor activity of AMG 925 correlated with the inhibition of STAT5 and RB phosphorylation, the pharmacodynamic markers for inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4, respectively. In addition, AMG 925 was also found to inhibit FLT3 mutants (e.g., D835Y) that are resistant to the current FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., AC220 and sorafenib). CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that plays an essential central role in regulating cell proliferation in response to external growth signals. A critical role of the CDK4-RB pathway in cancer development has been well established. CDK4-specific inhibitors are being developed for treating RB-positive cancer. AMG 925, which combines inhibition of two kinases essential for proliferation and survival of FLT3-mutated AML cells, may improve and prolong clinical responses.
A patient with epilepsy controlled by carbamazepine developed a carbamazepine neurotoxic reaction after being given an increased dosage of diltiazem hydrochloride as adjunctive therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of diltiazem reduced the circulating carbamazepine concentration and resulted in an epileptic attack. Awareness of the interaction between diltiazem and carbamazepine and careful monitoring of carbamazepine blood levels is recommended to prevent the dangerous neurotoxic effect associated with this combination.
Bilateral optic atrophy developed in a 15-year-old patient receiving concomitant neuraxis radiation therapy and weekly vincristine sulfate for medulloblastoma. Other neurologic manifestations that have been associated with vincristine therapy, including inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, hypertension, confusion, and a severe peripheral neuropathy, were also observed. Neither increased intracranial pressure nor active tumor was identified. Recovery of visual function followed discontinuation of vincristine. Other neurotoxicities also reversed with drug withdrawal. Visual loss occurring in a patient receiving vincristine should alert the physician to the possibility that the process is drug related. This complication may be more likely in patients receiving concomitant or previous cranial radiation therapy. Other central neurotoxicities of vincristine may also be accentuated by neuraxis radiation. It is recommended that vincristine be discontinued in this situation if an aggressive search for a structural anatomic lesion in the optic mechanism is unrevealing, as the prognosis for recovery of visual function appears excellent.
The purpose of this paper is to understand the association between antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), patient characteristics, changes in seizure pattern and emergent psychiatric disorder, i.e. psychosis or affective disorder. To this end we carried out a retrospective casenote study on 89 patients who developed psychiatric symptoms during treatment with topiramate, vigabatrin or tiagabine. The psychiatric problem was either an affective or a psychotic disorder (not including affective psychoses). It was discovered that 99% of the patients suffered from complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. More than half were on polytherapy with two or more other AEDs. Nearly two-thirds had a previous psychiatric history. There was a strong association between the type of previous psychiatric illness and the type of emerging psychiatric problem, both for psychoses and for affective disorders. Patients on vigabatrin had an earlier onset of epilepsy and more neurological abnormalities than those on topiramate. Those patients on lower doses had a shorter interval between the start of the AED therapy and the onset of the psychiatric problem. A seizure-free period was observed in more than half of the patients before they developed the psychiatric symptoms, and of these more were likely to develop a psychosis rather than an affective disorder. There seemed to be an association of suppression of right-sided seizures and the onset of the psychiatric problem. The conclusions drawn were that patients with a previous history of psychosis or affective disorder tended to develop the same psychiatric problem with new AEDs. Those with a seizure-free period before the onset of the psychiatric problem were more likely to develop a psychosis than an affective disorder.
It is known that 5-HT(4) receptor agonists increase sAPPalpha levels in the cortex and hippocampus of mice as well as in a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As sAPPalpha is thought to have pro-mnesic properties, we assessed whether its increase induces cognitive improvement in a spatial memory task and whether it reverses a scopolamine-induced memory deficit. Mice treated or not treated with scopolamine were trained in the Morris water maze for 3 days. Before the probe test, they received an injection of either a 5-HT(4) receptor agonist (prucalopride or RS 67333), or an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil), or both drugs. As expected, scopolamine decreased performance, an effect that was not reversed by the drugs tested when injected alone. However, prucalopride (5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) acted synergistically with donepezil (0.75 mg kg(-1), s.c.) to counteract completely scopolamine-induced amnesia. Western blot analysis of tissue homogenates in the cortex and hippocampus shows that sAPPalpha levels did not differ between saline- and scopolamine-treated mice. Furthermore, a region-dependent drug action was observed since the scopolamine-treated mice display a tendency to increase sAPPalpha levels in the hippocampus after donepezil or in the cortex after prucalopride. Our results suggest that a combined treatment with a 5-HT(4) receptor agonist with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor has beneficial effects on memory in mice. Moreover, it seems to enhance sAPPalpha levels in two brain regions highly affected in AD. Thus, a drug polytherapy could be interesting not only to enhance cognitive performance and decrease drawbacks but also to get the best action in each brain region.
A high incidence (39%) of positive direct antiglobulin tests (DATs) has been reported in patients taking Unasyn [ampicillin sodium plus sulbactam sodium (a beta-lactamase inhibitor)]. Three of four patients, with positive DATs, receiving Unasyn or Timentin [ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium (also a beta-lactamase inhibitor)] developed a haemolytic anaemia (HA) associated with a positive DAT, which resolved when drug therapy was stopped. The patients' sera did not react with red blood cells (RBCs) in the presence of Unasyn or Timentin, but when drug-treated RBCs were tested, patients' sera and normal sera reacted equally by indirect antiglobulin test. Following incubation in normal sera, RBCs treated with Unasyn, Timentin, Augmentin (amoxicillin + clavulanate), sulbactam and clavulanate reacted with anti-human globulin and anti-human albumin (an index of non-specific adsorption); RBCs treated with ampicillin and amoxicillin were nonreactive. The beta-lactamase inhibitors sulbactam and clavulanate seem to cause nonimmunologic adsorption of protein onto RBCs in vitro. This may explain the high incidence of positive DATs detected in patients taking Unasyn, which contains sulbactam. It was not possible to prove that there was a direct association between the nonspecific uptake of protein onto drug-treated RBCs in vitro with the positive DATs or the HA.
Of a population of 100 Swedish thalidomide embryopathy cases, at least four met full criteria for DSM-III-R autistic disorder and ICD-10 childhood autism. Thalidomide embryopathy of the kind encountered in these cases affects fetal development early in pregnancy, probably on days 20 to 24 after conception. It is argued that the possible association of thalidomide embryopathy with autism may shed some light on the issue of which neural circuitries may be involved in autism pathogenesis.
Two patients with extrapyramidal side effects after the use of fluphenazine decanoate were evaluated by means of IBZM-SPECT. Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy 1.5 months after withdrawal still amounted to 83% and 50%. More attention should be focused on long term effects of neuroleptics.
It was the aim of this study to report an aborted cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes consistent with Brugada syndrome due to liquorice-induced hypokalemia.
Ventricular fibrillation was witnessed in a 50-year-old woman who was admitted to our emergency department with a history of liquorice ingestion, a herbal product. After stopping liquorice ingestion, the Brugada-like electrocardiographic pattern changed progressively with potassium replacement. A diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was made after the ajmaline challenge test. The patient was discharged with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and had an uneventful follow-up.
This report illustrates the importance of the investigation for herbal medications in the detailed history of a patient in the cases of electrolyte disturbances and the potential role of hypokalemia in the induction of malignant arrhythmia in Brugada syndrome.
Relapse to drug taking is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of cocaine abuse. Animal studies have determined that various drugs are able to reinstate extinguished drug-taking behavior.
This study was designed to determine whether there is specificity in the ability of drugs to lead to cocaine-seeking and to compare potency and efficacy of a variety of drug primes. Another objective was to compare the effect of drugs with a primary dopaminergic mechanism with those having a secondary effect on dopaminergic substrates.
Following acquisition of cocaine self-administration, the ability of injections of cocaine (5.0-20.0 mg/kg), amphetamine (0.30-3.0 mg/kg), methylphenidate (2.0-20.0 mg/kg), nicotine (0.0375-0.60 mg/kg), caffeine (1.25-20.0 mg/kg), morphine (0.10-10.0 mg/kg) or delta 9THC (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) to reinstate extinguished drug taking was measured. Tests were conducted in a single day and were comprised of three phases. The first phase consisted of a 60-min period of cocaine self-administration. During phase 2, the cocaine solution was replaced with saline and responding was extinguished during the next 3-h period. During phase 3, in which saline again was the only solution available for self-administration, responding was monitored for 3-8 h following an injection of a drug prime.
Reinstatement was produced by experimenter-administered injections of cocaine, amphetamine, methylphenidate and caffeine but not nicotine, morphine or delta 9THC. The potency and efficacy of cocaine, methylphenidate and caffeine were comparable, whereas amphetamine was more potent and efficacious. Cocaine seeking occurred primarily during the first hour following the injection.
These findings suggest that cocaine seeking is only produced following administration of specific drugs. It is suggested that effective drug primes are those that produce a discriminative stimulus that generalizes to the stimulus produced by the reinforcing effects of cocaine.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of calcium channel blockers on bupivacaine-induced acute toxicity. For each of the three tested calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil and bepridil) 6 groups of mice were treated by two different doses, i.e. 2 and 10 mg/kg/i.p., or an equal volume of saline for the control group (n = 20); 15 minutes later, all the animals were injected with a single 50 mg/kg/i.p. dose of bupivacaine. The convulsant activity, the time of latency to convulse and the mortality rate were assessed in each group. The local anesthetic-induced mortality was significantly increased by the three different calcium channel blockers. The convulsant activity of bupivacaine was not significantly modified but calcium channel blockers decreased the time of latency to obtain bupivacaine-induced convulsions; this effect was less pronounced with bepridil.
The effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a potential anti-tumor agent, was assessed both in vivo and in vitro against MBT-2 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in C3H/HeHa mice. Systemic administration of either single or multiple doses of TNF into tumor bearing animals resulted in partial tumor regression and had a consistent but transient anti-tumor effect. Compared to control, untreated tumor bearing animals, TNF-treated tumor bearing mice had significantly smaller tumor volumes and slower tumor growth rates over the period of 12 days following TNF inoculation. No significant difference in tumor volumes and tumor growth rates between controls and TNF-inoculated mice was observed from day 12 to day 21 after TNF treatment. Assessment of TNF cytotoxicity against in vitro MBT-2 cell line using 3[H]-thymidine proliferation assay showed significant sensitivity of MBT-2 cells to treatment with TNF. A "Variant" MBT-2 cell line was derived by sequential culturing of the original MBT-2 cells in the presence of progressively higher concentrations of TNF in culture medium. Although the significant growth suppression on the MBT-2 tumor appears to be transient, further studies are warranted which may elucidate the immunologic and biologic behavior of TNF and this transplantable animal tumor.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors promote liver regeneration. The objective of the present study was to examine the role of VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) signaling in hepatic tissue repair after acetaminophen (N-acetyl-para-aminophenol) (APAP)-induced liver injury. To do this, we treated VEGFR1 tyrosine kinase knockout (VEGFR1 TK(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice with APAP (300 mg/kg, ip). In WT mice, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the necrotic area peaked between 8 and 24 h and then declined. In VEGFR1 TK(-/-) mice, ALT levels remained high at 48 h and extensive hepatic necrosis and hemorrhage were observed, as well as high mortality. Downregulation of hepatic messenger RNA expression of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 was also noted in VEGFR1 TK(-/-) mice. VEGFR1 TK(-/-) mice displayed lower expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and of growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor, CD31, and basic fibroblast growth factor than WT. The hepatic microvasculature in VEGFR1 TK(-/-) was compromised as evidenced by impaired sinusoidal perfusion, suppressed endocytosis in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and the formation of large gaps in LSECs. In WT mice, immunofluorescence revealed that recruited VEGFR1(+) cells in the necrotic area were positive for CD11b. VEGFR1 TK(-/-) exhibited fewer VEGFR1(+) and VEGFR2(+) cells. These results suggest that VEGFR1 signaling facilitates liver recovery from APAP hepatotoxicity by preventing excessive hemorrhage and reconstituting the sinusoids through recruitment of VEGFR1-expressing macrophages to the injured area and also through affecting expression of genes including hepatotrophic and pro-angiogenic growth factors.
Cirsium arisanense Kitamura (Compositae) has been used for hundreds of years in Taiwan as a folk medicine for hepatoprotection. However, no scientific research has demonstrated this effect. In the present study, we extracted the phenol-containing aqueous components of C. arisanense roots (CaR) and leaves/stem (CaL), and then assessed their hepatoprotective activities in both human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep 3B cells and C57BL/6 mice strain. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that the components of CaR and CaL differed from those of the positive control silymarin. CaR exhibited a higher phenolic content and antioxidant capacity than CaL. Hep 3B cells treated with silymarin (0-200 microg/ml) demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in viability; however, both CaR and CaL did not exhibit any apparent cytotoxicity. Silymarin at 100 microg/ml, as well as CaR and CaL, not only protect Hep 3B cells from tacrine-induced hepatotoxicity but also decrease the expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Moreover, an animal experiment demonstrated that CaR, CaL, and silymarin have hepatoprotective effects in C57BL/6 mice injected with tacrine, and they significantly decrease the levels of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). These effects of CaR and silymarin, but not of CaL, may occur via an increase in the hepatic glutathione level and the elimination of the nitric oxide production. In conclusion, the phenol-containing aqueous components from C. arisanense have potential in hepatoprotection.
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most serious complication of oral anticoagulation. This study investigated the risk of ICH for phenprocoumon which is the most widely used oral anticoagulant in Germany.
We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 13.4 million insurants of 4 German statutory health insurances (SHIs) who were continuously enrolled for 6 months prior to cohort entry. Cases were patients hospitalized for ICH. Ten controls were matched to each case by SHI, birth year, and sex using incidence density sampling. Rate ratios (RR) of ICH for current phenprocoumon use as compared to non-use were estimated from odds ratios calculated by conditional logistic regression analyses considering multiple risk factors.
Analysis of the full cohort revealed a strong increase in incidence of ICH with increasing age. In the nested case-control study including 8138 cases of ICH and 81,373 matched controls, we observed an increased risk of ICH for current phenprocoumon exposure that varied with age. The phenprocoumon-associated risk of ICH was lower in older age groups with RRs from 4.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.44-7.21) for phenprocoumon users less than 55 years of age to 2.43 (95%CI, 1.81-3.27) for those older than 85 years. Our study confirmed known risk factors of ICH.
Phenprocoumon exposure was associated with an increased risk of ICH. The interaction of risk for phenprocoumon with age was unexpected and needs further study.
Renal tubular vacuolization (RTV), which has been shown to occur after the use of iodinated contrast material, may be one of the earliest signs of contrast medium-induced renal injury. In this study, the authors tested a method for preventing RTV with the administration of acetylcysteine, theophylline, or both, prior to contrast medium administration.
Eighty rats were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. The treatment group consisted of three subgroups, each of which received prophylactic acetylcysteine, theophylline, or both before injection of iohexol. The control group comprised five subgroups, each of which received acetylcysteine, theophylline, both, normal saline injection, or orally administered normal saline prior to iohexol injection.
The occurrence of RTV in the treatment groups was compared with that in the control subgroup that received normal saline and iohexol. All of the rats in that control subgroup (n = 10) and 97% of the rats in the treatment group (n = 30) developed RTV.
The administration of acetylcysteine, theophylline, or both prior to iohexol injection did not prevent RTV from occurring in rats.
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory disorders associated with decreased colonic contractility. Here we show that, in experimental colitis in rat induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, there is a decrease in contraction in response to carbamoylcholine and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(+2) (SERCA) pump inhibitor thapsigargin. However, the decrease in contractility may occur due to decrease in the SERCA pump levels or their inactivation. Therefore, we examined the protein and mRNA levels for SERCA2 isoform, which is predominant isoform in colonic smooth muscle. There was a decrease in the levels of SERCA2 protein and mRNA levels in inflamed colonic muscle. These findings suggest that decreased SERCA pump levels is responsible for a decrease in the Ca(+2) stores in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum that causes a decrease in the contractility in colonic smooth muscle leading to poor bowel movements.
The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) has been shown to be overexpressed in acute and chronic leukemias and in a variety of solid human malignancies, including cancers of the breast and lung. In our present study, we investigated the potential role of WT1 gene in human colon cancer. WT1 mRNA and protein expression was analyzed in a panel of human colon cancer cell lines and primary colon carcinomas by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. A mutational screen of WT1' zinc-finger region was carried out by sequence analysis. Finally, using peptide-stimulated cytotoxic T cells it was investigated whether WT1-expressing colon tumor cells are a potential target for antigen-specific immunotherapy. Medium to high abundant levels of WT1 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR in 10 of 12 (83%) colon cell lines and by quantitative, real-time RT-PCR in 13 of 15 (87%) primary tumors, whereas only very low levels of expression were found in 2 primary tumors. Interestingly, however, low levels of WT1 mRNA were also detected in all samples derived from normal colon mucosa. When RT-PCR products were examined by sequence analysis, both +KTS and -KTS splice isoforms but no zinc-finger mutations were found, suggesting that the wild-type form of the WT1 gene is expressed. To determine whether the WT1 protein can serve as a target antigen for immunotherapy, 2 HLA-A2.1-restricted WT1 peptides (Db126 and WH187) were used for the in vitro induction of WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The WH187-specific CTLs not only lysed target cells pulsed exogenously with cognate peptide but also WT1-expressing colon tumor cells in a HLA-restricted manner. These findings identify the WT1 protein as an attractive target for the development of antigen-specific immunotherapy in human colon cancer.
Reflecting their exceptional potential to advance a range of biomedical, aeronautic, and other industrial products, carbon nanotube (CNT) production and the potential for human exposure to aerosolized CNTs are increasing. CNTs have toxicologically significant structural and chemical similarities to asbestos (AB) and have repeatedly been shown to cause pulmonary inflammation, granuloma formation, and fibrosis after inhalation/instillation/aspiration exposure in rodents, a pattern of effects similar to those observed following exposure to AB. To determine the degree to which responses to single-walled CNTs (SWCNT) and AB are similar or different, the pulmonary response of C57BL/6 mice to repeated exposures to SWCNTs, crocidolite AB, and ultrafine carbon black (UFCB) were compared using high-throughput global high performance liquid chromatography fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (HPLC-FTICR-MS) proteomics, histopathology, and bronchoalveolar lavage cytokine analyses. Mice were exposed to material suspensions (40 micrograms per mouse) twice a week for 3 weeks by pharyngeal aspiration. Histologically, the incidence and severity of inflammatory and fibrotic responses were greatest in mice treated with SWCNTs. SWCNT treatment affected the greatest changes in abundance of identified lung tissue proteins. The trend in number of proteins affected (SWCNT [376] > AB [231] > UFCB [184]) followed the potency of these materials in three biochemical assays of inflammation (cytokines). SWCNT treatment uniquely affected the abundance of 109 proteins, but these proteins largely represent cellular processes affected by AB treatment as well, further evidence of broad similarity in the tissue-level response to AB and SWCNTs. Two high-sensitivity markers of inflammation, one (S100a9) observed in humans exposed to AB, were found and may be promising biomarkers of human response to SWCNT exposure.
Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are heterogeneous cancers. In 2004, the identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) somatic mutations provided the first glimpse of a clinically relevant NSCLC oncogene. Approximately 70% of NSCLCs with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 L858R) attain responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib, with improved response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and in some reports overall survival (OS) when compared with EGFR wildtype (WT) cases. Three randomized trials of gefitinib versus chemotherapy (IPASS, WJTOG3405, NEJ002) in stage IV NSCLC have consistently demonstrated better RR and PFS (hazard ratios of 0.48 [IPASS], 0.49 [WJTOG3405] and 0.30 [NEJ002]) for EGFR-mutated NSCLCs treated with gefitinib. Novel irreversible EGFR TKIs (afatinib, XL647, PF00299804) show similar activity in EGFR-mutated patients. A translocation involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene with EML4, identified in 2007, is the most recent oncogene found in NSCLC. Crizotinib (PF02341066), an ALK TKI, has shown impressive activity against ALK translocated NSCLC in an expanded cohort of a phase I trial (NCT00585195). Over 80 patients have been treated and the RR is ∼60% with the 6-month PFS rate exceeding 70%. A registration phase III trial of crizotinib versus second-line chemotherapy (pemetrexed/docetaxel) is underway (PROFILE 1007, NCT00932893). KRAS, EGFR mutations and ALK translocations are mutually exclusive and few EGFR WT NSCLCs respond to EGFR TKIs. The promising results of EGFR and ALK TKIs in molecular subgroups of NSCLCs herald a new age of drug and clinical trial development for patients with NSCLC.
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GlcNAc-TIII), a product of the human MGAT3 gene, was discovered as a glycosyltransferase activity in hen oviduct. GlcNAc-TIII transfers GlcNAc in beta4-linkage to the core Man of complex or hybrid N-glycans, and thereby alters not only the composition, but also the conformation of the N-glycan. The dramatic consequences of the addition of this bisecting GlcNAc residue are reflected in the altered binding of lectins that recognize Gal residues on N-glycans. Changes in GlcNAc-TIII expression correlate with hepatoma and leukemia in rodents and humans, and the bisecting GlcNAc on Asn 297 of human IgG antibodies enhances their effector functions. Overexpression of a cDNA encoding GlcNAc-TIII alters growth control and cell-cell interactions in cultured cells, and in transgenic mice. While mice lacking GlcNAc-TIII are viable and fertile, they exhibit retarded progression of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver tumors. Further biological functions of GlcNAc-TIII are expected to be uncovered as mice with a null mutation in the Mgat3 gene are challenged.
Interspecies uncertainty factors in ecological risk assessment provide conservative estimates of risk where limited or no toxicity data is available. We quantitatively examined the validity of interspecies uncertainty factors by comparing the responses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) to the energetic compound 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), a known neurotoxicant. Relative toxicity was measured through transcriptional, morphological, and behavioral end points in zebrafish and fathead minnow fry exposed for 96 h to RDX concentrations ranging from 0.9 to 27.7 mg/L. Spinal deformities and lethality occurred at 1.8 and 3.5 mg/L RDX respectively for fathead minnow and at 13.8 and 27.7 mg/L for zebrafish, indicating that zebrafish have an 8-fold greater tolerance for RDX than fathead minnow fry. The number and magnitude of differentially expressed transcripts increased with increasing RDX concentration for both species. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in functions related to neurological disease, oxidative-stress, acute-phase response, vitamin/mineral metabolism and skeletal/muscular disorders. Decreased expression of collagen-coding transcripts were associated with spinal deformity and likely involved in sensitivity to RDX. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation for species-specific sensitivity to RDX where zebrafish responded at lower concentrations with greater numbers of functions related to RDX tolerance than fathead minnow. While the 10-fold interspecies uncertainty factor does provide a reasonable cross-species estimate of toxicity in the present study, the observation that the responses between ZF and FHM are markedly different does initiate a call for concern regarding establishment of broad ecotoxicological conclusions based on model species such as zebrafish.
A 17-year-old man with mediastinal seminoma was treated with chemotherapy and mediastinal irradiation therapy. Then he received high-dose chemotherapy containing cyclophosphamide (CY) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. He suffered from CY-induced cardiomyopathy beginning six days after the administration of high-dose CY. The predictable factors associated with the onset of CY-induced cardiomyopathy are not precisely known. It is suggested that the history of mediastinal irradiation was responsible for the onset of cardiomyopathy.
