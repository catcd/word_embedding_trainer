Symptoms of brain dysfunction occurred in a 67-year-old woman with idiopathic parkinsonism on treatment with levodopa. The adverse effect reappeared in a more severe and prolonged form when she was treated one year later with levodopa in combination with the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor Ro-4-4602. The symptoms were associated with a markedly altered level of HMPG (a noradrenaline metabolite) in the cerebrospinal fluid.
Recent studies indicated that extensive culture of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can lead to malignant transformation, supporting the concept that tumor may originate from adult stem cells. Also, neoplastic transformation of BMSCs induced by virus and ionizing radiation were verified. However, the capacity for BMSCs to become mutated by chemical carcinogens and become precursors of cancer is still poorly understood. In this study, BMSCs were used to test the hypothesis that tumorigenesis can originate from the mutation of stem cells induced by chemical carcinogen. BMSCs were intermittently treated with 10(-6)M 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) from population doublings level (PDL) 3 until senescence occurred. Proliferation data demonstrated that BMSCs treated with 4-NQO bypassed the senescence phase and exhibited unlimited proliferation and anchorage independence. These cells underwent a malignant transformation that resulted in tumor formation in 12/12 immunodeficient mice that received the cells by tail vein injection. In contrast, spontaneous transformation of BMSCs was observed in 6/12 immunodeficient mice injected with BMSCs that had been cultured over PDL 30 in vitro. For both BMSCs treated with 4-NQO, and BMSCs maintained in long-term culture, their transformation into neoplastic cells was found to involve chromosomal abnormalities, increased telomerase activity, and reduced, or absent, expression of p53. Our results also indicate that BMSCs are susceptible to carcinogen-induced malignant transformation rather than spontaneous transformation. Therefore, carcinogen-induced BMSCs transformation models may be ideal for studying mechanisms associated with the promotion of tumor formation by chemical carcinogens.
Two adult patients living with AIDS presented with severe bone pain associated with tenofovir (TDF) use. Both were unable to walk without assistance and were severely restricted in their movement due to the bone pain. Both had mild renal impairment, Fanconi syndrome, and bone mineral density (BMD) loss. Bone pain and inability to walk were reversible with the cessation of TDF and supplementation with Vitamin D(3), calcium, and phosphate. These cases appear to be examples of the severity of BMD loss associated with TDF use and suggest not only attention to renal function with TDF use, but also monitoring of alkaline phosphatase (bone fraction) and plasma phosphorus as indicators of BMD loss.
After a hysterectomy, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, two courses of intra-peritoneal chemotherapy of Cisplatinum, Carmofur (HCFU, 600 mg/day [per os]) were given a patient who had ovarian granulosa cell tumor (malignant, stage Iai). Dizziness and loss of consciousness developed about 60 days after administration of HCFU, and leucoencephalopathy was diagnosed. A CT revealed a diffuse low density area in the white matter of the cerebrum. Myelin Basic Protein in the spinal fluid was found to amount to 9.8 mg/dl, which in norm. person is less than 4.0 mg/dl. Also, it showed parallel changes with the course of the clinical findings. HCFU easily dissolves to fat and changes to 5-FU without enzymes in the liver cell. Further HCFU also passes through Blood Brain Barrier to Produce 5-FU and its derivatives, in which the alpha-Fluoro-beta-Alanine is thought to be the culprit that brings on leucoencephalopathy. Even so, HCFU should be dosed when needed in spite of this risk. Other 5-FU modifiers also have been reported to produce the same effect in several cases.
Antimalarial agents are routinely used in the management of connective tissues diseases and various skin disorders. Ophthalmologic, neurological and digestive side effects of antimalarial agents are well known. However, cardiac toxicity is uncommon. We report a 49-year-old patient, treated with chloroquine for 21 years for a systemic lupus erythematosus and a discoid lupus, who presented a complete atrioventricular block that required implantation of a cardiac pacemaker in emergency. This patient did not have significant cardiovascular past medical history. Investigations excluded known causes of atrioventricular block and chloroquine toxicity was diagnosed. This case report illustrates the cardiotoxicity of synthetic antimalarial agents. A regular cardiovascular monitoring (especially with electrocardiogram) could be useful in patients receiving long-term treatment with antimalarial agents.
The negative impact of antipsychotic drugs on attention is expected to be greater in late-life schizophrenia because of the age-related changes in the dopamine receptor reserve. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between dopamine D2 receptor blockade by risperidone and the cognitive function in late-life schizophrenia. Subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder aged 50 or older who were receiving risperidone completed a [C]raclopride positron emission tomography scan to measure D2-binding potential in the striatum. The D2 receptor blockade by risperidone was calculated using age-corrected measures from healthy individuals and region of interest analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography data coregistered to the subjects' magnetic resonance imaging scans. Cognitive function was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests that included the Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS). Eleven subjects (mean +/- SD age, 64 +/- 8 years) participated in this study. The mean +/- SD D2 receptor blockade was 69% +/- 14% (range, 34%-80%). The age-corrected score on the attention subscale in the DRS was negatively correlated with the D2 receptor blockade. The DRS attention subscale score was lower in the subjects who experienced 74.9% or higher D2 blockade (median value, corresponding to a daily risperidone dose of >3.0 mg) than in those who did not. Although a causal attribution cannot be made in light of the cross-sectional nature of this study, the results suggest the critical importance of identifying the lowest effective dose of antipsychotic drugs in older patients with schizophrenia.
We investigated the effects of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol treatment of rats on various transport functions in isolated basolateral and canalicular liver plasma membrane vesicles. Both membrane subfractions were purified to a similar degree from control and cholestatic livers. Although moderate membrane lipid alterations were predominantly observed in basolateral vesicles, no change in basolateral Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity was found. Furthermore, while Na(+)-dependent taurocholate uptake was decreased by approximately 40% in basolateral vesicles, the maximal velocity of ATP-dependent taurocholate transport was decreased by 63% in canalicular membranes. In contrast, only minimal changes or no changes at all were observed for electrogenic taurocholate transport in "cholestatic" canalicular membranes and total microsomes, respectively. However, canalicular vesicles from cholestatic livers also exhibited marked reductions in ATP-dependent transport of S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione and in Na(+)-dependent uptake of adenosine, while in the same vesicles HCO3-/SO4- exchange and Na+/glycine cotransport activities were markedly stimulated. These data show that in addition to the previously demonstrated sinusoidal transport abnormalities ethinylestradiol-induced cholestasis is also associated with multiple canalicular membrane transport alterations in rat liver. Hence, functional transport alterations at both polar surface domains might ultimately be responsible for the inhibitory effects of estrogens on the organic anion excretory capacity and on bile formation in rat liver.
To find a more excellent large-dose isoproterenol (ISO) induced heart failure (HF) rat model.
166 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups, normal group (n=10), 85/85 mg/kg group (n=50), 85/340 mg/kg group (n=50) and 340/340 mg/kg group (n=56). HF was induced by two subcutaneous injections of homologous ISO on 2 consecutive days. We calculated death rate of each ISO group on different time points. And all the survival ISO rats were examined by echocardiography separately on 2 weeks, 3 weeks and 4 weeks. We defined the EF<45% rats as heart failure, and calculated EF<45% rate of three ISO groups. 4 weeks after the last injection, all of the rats were sacrificed. H&E and Masson staining were used to evaluate inflammatory infiltration and myocardial fibrosis, and immunohistochemistry was used to measure the levels of IL-1, IL-6 and IL-17. We also treated adult rat cardiac fibroblasts with IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, or PBS for 24 h, and real-time PCR was used to measure the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in treated fibroblasts.
Through 4-week observation, we found that the period within 2 days after the last injection was the most dangerous one for all the ISO rats, regardless of injection dose. Then, the death rate increased slowly. 4 weeks later, the death rates were respectively 30% in 85/85 mg/kg group, 60% in 85/340 mg/kg group, and 68% in 340/340 mg/kg group, and there were statistical differences among three experimental groups. Moreover, the EF<45% rate and cardiac fibrosis rate were 100% in 85/340 mg/kg group as same as 340/340 mg/kg group, and much higher than 85/85 mg/kg group. Furthermore, we also found that pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and IL-17) increased in 85/340 mg/kg group compared with normal group, and above cytokines could induce MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in cardiac fibroblasts.
85/340 mg/kg ISO induced HF rat model was superior to the other two dose ISO induced HF rat models. Pro-inflammatory cytokines might contribute to HF and myocardial fibrosis through promotion of MMPs expression in cardiac fibroblasts.
The effect of morphine and naloxone on acute cocaine toxicity was studied. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated intraperitoneally (ip) with saline, morphine sulfate 25 mg/kg, or naloxone 1.0 mg/kg 15 minutes prior to challenge by cocaine. After pretreatment, each group was challenged with one of three doses of cocaine (35, 50, or 75 mg/kg ip). Each of the nine drug combinations was tested on at least 10 animals. Animals were observed for behavior, seizures, and death. The animals pretreated with saline and challenged with cocaine (35, 50, or 75 mg/kg) had seizure incidences of 0%, 40%, and 100%, respectively, after increasing doses. Pretreatment with morphine resulted in cocaine-induced seizures of 20%, 80% and 100%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.05 with cocaine 35 and 50 mg/kg). Time to seizures in these groups did not differ significantly compared to the saline groups. Pretreatment with naloxone resulted in cocaine-induced seizures of 0%, 50%, and 60% (p less than or equal to 0.05 at the 75 mg/kg dose). The incidence of death was significantly increased by pretreatment with morphine in animals that received cocaine 50 or 75 mg/kg. The time to death was not significantly different compared to saline controls. The death rate in naloxone pretreated animals was not significantly different from the saline groups. In additional studies, high-dose naloxone pretreatment (10 mg/kg) also failed to provide protection from acute cocaine toxicity. In conclusion, cocaine toxicity is potentiated by morphine and does not appear to be altered by naloxone.
Androgens have a major role in the growth and the maintenance of both cancellous and cortical bone mass in men. Androgen receptor is expressed in osteoblasts, osteoclasts and bone marrow stromal cells. Androgens have been shown to regulate the expression and the activity of several cytokines and growth factors, and control the homeostasis in bones. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has a protective effect against osteoporosis in women after menopause through the intracrine mechanism in osteoblasts, which DHEA is converted to estrogen through the aromatase activity.
Although both lithium and triiodothyronine (T3) augmentation strategies may be rapid, safe, and effective ways of treating patients who fail to respond to tricyclics, little is known about the clinical or biochemical correlates of response. We examined clinical and endocrine variables which distinguished T3 and lithium responders from each other and from non-responders in a post-hoc analysis of two studies involving 51 subjects who had received these augmentation strategies under double-blind conditions. Lithium non-responders were more severely depressed and had more insomnia and weight loss than responders. T3 responders could be distinguished from lithium responders by greater weight loss. There were no reliable clinical differences between T3 responders and non-responders. Thyroid function tests did not differ between any of the treatment or response groups. Our findings suggest that clinical but not endocrine variables may distinguish responders to these two augmentation strategies.
Twenty-four evaluable patients with recurrent or advanced squamous carcinoma of the cervix were treated with ifosfamide (IFX) and mesna every 3 weeks. The initial dose of IFX was 1.5 g/m2 q.d. Days 1-5. Mesna was given by continuous infusion (1.5 g/m2/day Days 1-6). Seventy-four courses of treatment were given to 24 patients. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. The median survival was 26 weeks from initiation of chemotherapy. There were 4 complete responders (CR); there was 1 partial responder. The response rate was 20.8% (CI, 4-38%). One CR patient remains in clinical remission 30 months after initiation of therapy. The other 3 responders recurred after a disease-free interval of 8, 12, and 18 weeks. WBC below 3000/mm3 occurred in 19 patients and was life threatening (below 1000/mm3) in 5 patients. One patient had life-threatening hemorrhagic cystitis. Eleven patients developed CNS symptoms during treatment including somnolence, coma, and acute delirium.
Isoprenaline (isoproterenol) is a beta-adrenergic drug, used to increase the heart rate and, during electrophysiological study, to facilitate the induction of supraventricular (SVT) and ventricular tachycardias (VT). Decrease in heart rate during isoprenaline infusion is a rare phenomenon. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the incidence, the possible mechanisms, and the significance of a paradoxical bradycardia induced by isoprenaline infusion.
Electrophysiological study was performed for the evaluation of tachycardias (n = 551) or dizziness/syncope (n = 214) in 765 patients aged from 15 to 85 years. The study was negative in the basal state, and was repeated after isoprenaline infusion (2-4 microg/min).
In 714 patients, this perfusion increased the heart rate to 100-140 bpm. A bradycardia was noted in 51 patients (7%). Two bradyarrhythmias were noted: (1) sinus or junctional bradycardia (cycle length - 10%) occurred in 43 patients, aged 15-70 years, generally studied for unexplained syncope (n = 37); a young age (40+/-16 years), syncope (n = 37) and absence of heart disease (n = 27) were more frequent than that in patients without isoprenaline-induced sinus or junctional bradycardia; another arrhythmia (SVT or VT) was induced in seven patients with syncope, five with heart disease and two without; six young patients (<50 years) had no syncope and were studied for SVT or VT; (2) eight patients, aged 65+/-11 years, developed second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block which was supraHisian (n = 4) or infraHisian (n = 4); they were studied for exercise-related syncope; they had no signs of myocardial ischaemia and AV block was reproduced by ajmaline testing: isoprenaline revealed organic conduction disturbance.
The occurrence of paradoxical bradycardia was a rare finding during isoprenaline infusion (7%); sinus or junctional bradycardia was a sign of hypervagotonia, but was without clinical significance in 35% of these patients. The development of second-degree AV block was always pathological and associated with AV conduction disturbances, which occurred spontaneously during exercise. Isoprenaline infusion appeared to be a simple means to detect organic AV conduction disturbance in patients complaining of exercise or stress-related dizziness/syncope and unable to perform exercise test.
The effect of estradiol benzoate on the increase in activity induced by d-amphetamine (0.25 mg/kg) was studied in male rats. Both short latency and long latency effects were observed. Amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was increased 45 minutes after estradiol (50 micrograms/kg) administration, decreased one day later and again increased during the period 8-16 days after injection. At doses of 12.5 and 25 micrograms/kg, effects were smaller and not statistically significant, although they had a similar temporal pattern to the 50 micrograms/kg dose. The short-latency, presumably non-genomic, effect of EB was studied in more detail at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the administration of 50 micrograms/kg EB. An enhancement of the amphetamine-induced increase in locomotor activity reached its maximum 30 minutes after injection. The time factor was critical for the effects observed, and the results supported the view that estrogen may alter behavior mediated by dopaminergic pathways.
Promoter and 5' end methylation regulation of tumour suppressor genes is a common feature of many cancers. Such occurrences often lead to the silencing of these key genes and thus they may contribute to the development of cancer, including prostate cancer.
In order to identify methylation changes in prostate cancer, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using Agilent human CpG island arrays. Using computational and gene-specific validation approaches we have identified a large number of potential epigenetic biomarkers of prostate cancer. Further validation of candidate genes on a separate cohort of low and high grade prostate cancers by quantitative MethyLight analysis has allowed us to confirm DNA hypermethylation of HOXD3 and BMP7, two genes that may play a role in the development of high grade tumours. We also show that promoter hypermethylation is responsible for downregulated expression of these genes in the DU-145 PCa cell line.
This study identifies novel epigenetic biomarkers of prostate cancer and prostate cancer progression, and provides a global assessment of DNA methylation in prostate cancer.
Several drugs can cause immune hemolytic anemia. Here a patient who developed hemolytic anemia after treatment with teicoplanin is described.
Owing to a two-vessel disease, a 68-year-old white man underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. He was readmitted for superficial sternal wound infection and sternal instability. Rewiring was required and worsening anemia characterized the course after the reoperation. Drugs used in the second admission were gentamycin, teicoplanin, paracetamol, and codeine. They were considered as a possible cause of drug-induced hemolytic anemia.
The DAT was positive for complement and IgG. Autoanti-e was identified in the patient's undiluted serum sample. The eluate was reactive with all RBCs tested only after adding teicoplanin; when diluted 1:4, anti-e specificity was observed in the presence of teicoplanin.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of immune hemolytic anemia owing to teicoplanin.
Prasugrel, a thienopyridine ADP receptor antagonist, is an orally administered prodrug requiring in vivo metabolism to form the active metabolite that irreversibly inhibits platelet activation and aggregation mediated by the P2Y12[sub 12] receptor. A comprehensive nonclinical safety assessment including genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies supported the chronic use of prasugrel in patients with atherothrombotic disease. In addition, a special assessment of the potential for prasugrel to enhance tumor growth was undertaken to address regulatory concerns relating to increases in human cancers. Prasugrel demonstrated no evidence of genotoxicity and was not oncogenic in a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. In the 2-year mouse study, an increase in hepatocellular adenomas was considered secondary to enzyme induction and not relevant to human safety. Further, the absence of any increase in common background tumors at any other organ site in either rodent study indicated a lack of tumor promoting activity (apart from the CYP450 induction-related increase in mouse liver tumors). Cell culture studies with 3 human tumor cell lines (lung, colon, prostate) demonstrated that exposure of serum-starved cells to prasugrel's active and major circulating human metabolites does not increase cell proliferation relative to starved cells stimulated to proliferate by addition of 10% FBS. Prasugrel also did not increase tumor growth relative to vehicle controls in nude mice implanted with 3 human tumor cell lines. Thus, traditional genotoxicity and 2-year bioassays as well as specially designed tumor growth enhancement studies in human tumor cell lines and mouse xenograft models clearly demonstrated prasugrel's lack of tumorigenic potential.
Gemcitabine and paclitaxel are currently co-administered in clinical studies for bladder cancer as this drug combination may offer better tumor responses. However, the drugs may antagonize the cytotoxic capacity of each other due to cell cycle perturbations. In this study, we evaluated different application schedules to determine the efficacy of the combination and its potential interactions.
Bladder cancer cell lines were exposed to either gemcitabine or paclitaxel, in concentrations ranging from 1-1000 nM. The inhibition concentrations (IC) 20, 50 and 70 were assessed by MTT assay after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Then, the cytotoxic activity and apoptosis induction abilities of the combined agents using the IC20 concentration were analyzed by MTT and Annexin-V/PI staining, respectively. The effects on the cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometry of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and propidium iodide (PI).
Gemcitabine and paclitaxel dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation. Simultaneous application of gemcitabine/paclitaxel yielded superior cytotoxicity rates after 48 and 72 hours. Sequential treatment of cells showed similar results when gemcitabine was given 24 hours before paclitaxel. However, when paclitaxel was given before gemcitabine, the cell kill was less. Gemcitabine as well as paclitaxel have potent apoptosis inducing abilities. Cell cycle evaluation demonstrated a shift towards the S-phase after gemcitabine and a progressive G2/M block after paclitaxel treatment.
The combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel in vitro yields superior cytotoxic efficacy, if given simultaneously or with gemcitabine first. While in vitro cell models may not necessarily predict clinical outcome, they do provide a basis for rational scheduling of drugs in clinical trials.
Two cases of disulfiram-induced hepatitis are presented. Both cases had prompt recurrence of abnormal liver function tests after rechallenge with small doses of the drug. All cases of disulfiram-induced hepatotoxicity reported in the English literature are reviewed.
The role of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in mediating the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine (METH) was tested in mice lacking DAT. Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) content, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and free radical formation were assessed as markers of METH neurotoxicity in the striatum and/or hippocampus of wild-type, heterozygote, and homozygote (DAT -/-) mice. Four injections of METH (15 mg/kg, s.c.), each given 2 hr apart, produced 80 and 30% decreases in striatal DA and 5-HT levels, respectively, in wild-type animals 2 d after administration. In addition, GFAP mRNA and protein expression levels, extracellular DA levels, and free radical formation were increased markedly. Hippocampal 5-HT content was decreased significantly as well (43%). Conversely, no significant changes were observed in total DA content, GFAP expression, extracellular DA levels, or free radical formation in the striatum of DAT -/- mice after METH administration. However, modest decreases were observed in striatal and hippocampal 5-HT levels (10 and 17%, respectively). These observations demonstrate that DAT is required for, and DA is an essential mediator of, METH-induced striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity, whereas serotonergic deficits are only partially dependent on DAT.
A comparison of patients receiving combination chemotherapy with mitomycin C, mitozantrone and methotrexate (3M) with and without tamoxifen for treatment of primary breast cancer indicates an increased risk of anaemia (P < 0.0001) and thrombocytopenia (P < 0.001), but not leucopenia for patients receiving tamoxifen with their chemotherapy compared to those receiving the chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, 9 out of 94 patients receiving tamoxifen with 3M developed progressive anaemia, thrombocytopenia and abnormal renal function as early features of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, progressing on to various degrees of the haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This is only rarely seen with patients receiving mitomycin C alone at higher doses than used in the 3M combination and in the presence of active metastatic disease. This syndrome can be fatal and 1 of our 9 patients died. These observations indicate that there may be an interaction between tamoxifen and mitomycin C, causing an increased incidence of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and an increased risk of HUS. The combination of these two drugs should be avoided or carefully monitored.
The herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitril (DCBN) is a potent and tissue-specific toxicant to the olfactory mucosa (OM). The toxicity of DCBN is mediated by cytochrome P450 (P450)-catalyzed bioactivation; however, it is not known whether target-tissue metabolic activation is essential for toxicity. CYP2A5, expressed abundantly in both liver and OM, was previously found to be one of the P450 enzymes active in DCBN bioactivation in vitro. The aims of this study were to determine the role of CYP2A5 in DCBN toxicity in vivo, by comparing the extents of DCBN toxicity between Cyp2a5-null and wild-type (WT) mice, and to determine whether hepatic microsomal P450 enzymes (including CYP2A5) are essential for the DCBN toxicity, by comparing the extents of DCBN toxicity between liver-Cpr-null (LCN) mice, which have little P450 activity in hepatocytes, and WT mice. We show that the loss of CYP2A5 expression did not alter systemic clearance of DCBN (at 25 mg/kg); but it did inhibit DCBN-induced non-protein thiol depletion and cytotoxicity in the OM. Thus, CYP2A5 plays an essential role in mediating DCBN toxicity in the OM. In contrast to the results seen in the Cyp2a5-null mice, the rates of systemic DCBN clearance were substantially reduced, while the extents of DCBN-induced nasal toxicity were increased, rather than decreased, in the LCN mice, compared to WT mice. Therefore, hepatic P450 enzymes, although essential for DCBN clearance, are not necessary for DCBN-induced OM toxicity. Our findings form the basis for a mechanism-based approach to assessing the potential risks of DCBN nasal toxicity in humans.
Triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder which is characterized by alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, and achalasia. We report on a 14-year old girl with dysphagia, regurgitation, and vomiting since 5 years. At the age of five years an Addison crisis was diagnosed and cortisone substitution was initiated. In addition, the patient had episodes of conjunctivitis. Severe esophagitis and candida infection were diagnosed by esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and treated with omeprazole and fluconazole. The esophageal barium swallow was typical for achalasia. Medical treatment of achalasia with oral nifedipine resulted only in a partial and temporal improvement. But after seven balloon dilatations dysphagia and nocturnal coughing improved clearly and a remarkable gain of weight could be seen. Direct sequencing showed a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 11 of the AAAS gene leading to truncation at position 342 of the 546 amino acid protein.
Triple A syndrome has to be considered in patients with dysphagia. In our patient, the absence of tears since birth followed by adrenal insufficiency were early signs of the triple A syndrome. Balloon dilatation of the esophago-gastric junction is an effective treatment, which can avoid surgical interventions.
Exposure to fenvalerate was demonstrated to be toxic to the male reproductive system. Our previous data revealed that intracellular calcium plays an important role in regulating the above toxicity, through actions on both T-type calcium channels and endoplasmic reticulum calcium signals. The present study explored the effects of fenvalerate on the expression of calmodulin in mouse testis and GC-2spd(ts) cells, and its association with fenvalerate-induced male reproductive toxicity. Male mice were subjected to different doses (3.71, 18.56, 37.12, 92.81 mg/kg bw) of fenvalerate or vehicle control for 4 weeks. Expression of calmodulin was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis in mouse testis. Similar approaches were utilized in GC-2spd(ts) cells cultured with 5 μM fenvalerate at different time points. In the in vivo study, all mice survived through the entire 4 weeks. Administration of fenvalerate resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in testis weight/body weight, sperm motility, and increased head abnormality rate. By histological staining, mice treated with fenvalerate at higher doses showed dilated seminiferous tubules and disturbed arrangement of spermatogenic cells. Meanwhile, both mRNA and protein expression of calmodulin were significantly increased in the testes of mice exposed to fenvalerate compared to control mice. Moreover, in the in vitro study, 5 μM fenvalerate significantly increased the expression of calmodulin at the mRNA and protein levels in GC-2spd(ts) cells after 8 h of incubation and sustained these levels for at least 24 h. Collectively, these data suggested that enhanced expression of calmodulin correlates with male reproductive damage induced by fenvalerate.
Rats with hypercalcemia induced by injection of vitamin D2 had a decreased thyroid somatostatin content, whereas the somatostatin content in their pancreas was almost within the normal range. This suggests that somatostatin in different organs acts specifically on each particular organ as a local hormone or hormone-like substance.
Two-year rodent bioassays play a central role in evaluating the carcinogenic potential of both commercial products and environmental contaminants. The bioassays are expensive and time consuming, requiring years to complete and costing $2-4 million. In this study, we compare transcriptomic and metabonomic technologies for discovering biomarkers that can efficiently and economically identify chemical carcinogens without performing a standard two-year rodent bioassay. Animals were exposed subchronically to two chemicals (one genotoxic and one nongenotoxic) that were positive for lung and liver tumors in a standard two-year bioassay, two chemicals that were negative, and two control groups. Microarray analysis performed on liver and lung tissues identified multiple biomarkers in each tissue that could discriminate between carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic treatments. The discriminating biomarkers shared a common expression profile among carcinogenic treatments despite different genotoxicity categories and potential modes of action, suggesting that they reflect underlying cellular changes in the transition toward neoplasia. Statistical classification analysis exhibited 100% accuracy in both tissues when the number of genes was less than 5000. Additional genes reduced the predictive accuracy of the model. Serum samples were analyzed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and chemical-specific metabolites were removed from the spectra. The statistical classification analysis of the endogenous serum metabolites showed relatively low predictive accuracy with few metabolites in the model, but the accuracy increased to a maximum of 94% when all metabolites were added. These results suggest that individual endogenous metabolites are relatively poor biomarkers, but the metabolite profile as a whole is altered following carcinogen treatment.
