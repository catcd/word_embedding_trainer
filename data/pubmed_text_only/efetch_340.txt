Methyldopa is an antihypertensive medication which is available generically and under the trade name Aldomet that is widely prescribed in the adult population and infrequently used in children. Methyldopa causes an autoimmune hemolytic anemia in a small percentage of patients who take the drug. We report a case of methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia in a 15-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with near-syncope. The boy had been treated with intravenous methyldopa during a trauma admission seven weeks prior to presentation. Evaluation revealed a hemoglobin of three grams, 3+ Coombs' test with polyspecific anti-human globulin and monospecific IgG reagents, and a warm reacting autoantibody. Transfusion and corticosteroid therapy resulted in a complete recovery of the patient. Emergency physicians treating children must be aware of this syndrome in order to diagnose and treat it correctly. A brief review of autoimmune and drug-induced hemolytic anemias is provided.
To investigate the expression and effect of matrix metaloproteinases-9 in lung injury of rats with acute paraquat poisoning.
50 SD rats were randomly divided into control group and poisoned group. At 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 days after exposed to paraquat, five rats of each group were used to assess lung pathological changes, and the expression of MMP-9 mRNA in lungs was evaluated by RT-PCR.
(1) The expressions of MMP-9 protein and mRNA markedly increased at the first day of paraquat poison, reached the peak at the 7th day, decreased slowly afterwards. (2) The expressions of MMP-9 protein and mRNA markedly increased at 1, 3, 7 days. The protein expression of MMP-9 returned to baseline level at the 28th day, and mRNA expression of MMP-9 returned to baseline at the 14th day.
The expression of MMP-9 in lung fibroblasts is up-regulated in silicotic fibrosis model.
AF-DX 116 (see chemical name below) is a competitive antagonist of muscarine receptors in peripheral organs. In contrast to pirenzepine, its behaviour in functional experiments indicates selectivity for the M2 muscarinic subtype. In pithed rats AF-DX 116 inhibits vagally-induced bradycardia, an M2 response, (ED50 32 micrograms/kg i.v.) in preference to the M1-mediated pressor response to McN-A-343 (ED50 211 micrograms/kg i.v.). AF-DX 116 further discriminates among M2 receptors, showing a high affinity for the cardiac muscarine receptors. In isolated preparations, AF-DX 116 has a tenfold higher affinity for the muscarine receptors of the heart (pA2 7.33) than for those in smooth muscles (pA2 6.39-6.44). The same profile appears from animal studies, where the compound is a more potent antagonist of either endogenously or exogenously activated cardiac muscarine responses as compared to vascular, smooth muscle or secretory responses. In general, the ratios of potencies (ED50) observed in cardiac vs. other muscarine mediated functions ranged between 30 and 50. Atropine showed no discrimination, inhibiting all muscarine responses in the same range of doses. In the conscious dog intravenous AF-DX 116 increased basal heart rate, and completely reversed the reflex bradycardia induced by clonidine. Tachycardia was dose-related (ED50 79 micrograms/kg i.v.), and occurred independently of background sympathetic tone. AF-DX 116 clearly distinguishes between M1- and M2-mediated responses; it also emphasizes the long-recognized heterogeneity among the peripheral M2 subtypes. AF-DX 116, for its pronounced cardioselectivity, may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of sinus bradycardia.
Leishmaniasis is emerging as a common and serious opportunistic disease for patients with HIV infection. Almost all cases of HIV-Leishmania coinfection have been described in Mediterranean countries and they occur with various clinical presentations, ranging from typical visceral forms to asymptomatic or atypical cases, including cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Pentavalent antimony compounds have been the mainstays of antileishmanial therapy for half a century and new lipid formulations of amphotericin B seem reliable, but the most effective treatment remains unknown. We describe a patient who was HIV infected and an intravenous drug user, with an unusual disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis, after an initial visceral disease and after a 13-month maintenance treatment with liposomal amphotericin. The severe concurrent immunosuppression probably played an essential role in leading to this atypical cutaneous form, characterized by diffuse, nonulcerated, nonscabby maculopapular lesions.
In an open, randomised, controlled follow-up study the effectiveness of continuous azathioprine therapy of multiple sclerosis with a dosage of 2 mg/kg/day was tested against a control group that was not treated with cytostatics. In the treated group the disease progressed less rapidly than in the untreated group. Statistically significant differences were only seen in patients having an intermittent-progressive course. The effect of azathioprine on the course was not dependent on the period or severity of illness nor on the patient's sex. In chronically progressive disease and with an intermittent disease course no influence of azathioprine was observed.
The enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), effects repair of DNA after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury to cells in nerve and muscle tissue. However, its activation in severely damaged cells can lead to ATP depletion and death. We show that PARP expression is enhanced in damaged renal proximal tubules beginning at 6-12 h after I/R injury. Intraperitoneal administration of PARP inhibitors, benzamide or 3-amino benzamide, after I/R injury accelerates the recovery of normal renal function, as assessed by monitoring the levels of plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen during 6 days postischemia. PARP inhibition leads to increased cell proliferation at 1 day postinjury as assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen and improves the histopathological appearance of kidneys examined at 7 days postinjury. Furthermore, inhibition of PARP increases levels of ATP measured at 24 h postischemia compared with those in vehicle-treated animals. Our data indicate that PARP activation is a part of the cascade of molecular events that occurs after I/R injury in the kidney. Although caution is advised, transient inhibition of PARP postischemia may constitute a novel therapy for acute renal failure.
To present the efficacy and tolerability of a new oral dosage form of the calcium antagonist nitrendipine compared to nifedipine capsules in patients with hypertensive emergency.
Multicenter randomized double blind clinical study.
23 study centres (hospitals) in Germany.
161 patients between 20 and 70 years with acutely elevated blood pressure (systolic 200-250 mmHg, diastolic between 110-140 mmHg) with and without concomitant clinical symptoms.
Double blind treatment with 10 mg nifedipine or 5 mg nitrendipine. Nifedipine was administered as capsules, nitrendipine was given from a small plastic tube (vial), containing 1 ml alcoholic solution. Every patient received in addition to the test medication a placebo corresponding to the other product. Patients with insufficient treatment after 45 min were given either an additional capsule of 10 mg nifedipine or a further vial containing 5 mg nitrendipine according to their group and maintaining the double dummy procedure.
Blood pressure and heart rate were measured repeatedly during 4 h, before and 90 min after beginning of the treatment a 12 channel resting ECG was recorded. At 45 min after administration the blood pressure had fallen significantly from 216.0/117.4 mmHg to 170.0/93.3 mmHg under nifedipine and from 216.9/117.3 mmHg to 177.4/94.4 mmHg under nitrendipine. 61.6% of the nifedipine patients and 58.8% of the nitrendipine patients had already reached blood pressure values < 180/100 mmHg after 45 min and in both groups 83% of these patients were still in this limit at the end of the observation period after 4 h. Tolerability was very good in both groups.
The new dosage form of nitrendipine (vial with 1 ml of alcoholic solution) represents an alternative in the treatment of hypertensive emergency.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) that has an elevated risk of developing into colon cancer. In trials to develop new therapeutic alternatives for UC, it is important to fulfill modifying effects on pathogenic targets and to reach the colon in a high concentration. Thus, the current work has investigated a colon-specific delivery formula of resveratrol in targeting sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and apoptotic pathways to control pathogenesis and its progression to any expected neoplasm. This work was conducted on 40 Wister albino rats equally divided into 4 groups where group I served as the normal control group. The untreated oxazolone-induced colitis in group II exhibited significant increase in SphK1 activity as well as activity of both myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 with concomitant mild DNA fragmentation in colonic tissue. Colonic SphK1 activity showed significant positive correlation with the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological score in this group. Comparable with treatment by the native resveratrol formula, nRes (group III), treatment by the colon-specific delivery resveratrol formula, cRes (group IV) caused significant decrease in the activity of SphK1 and MPO with massive DNA fragmentation in colonic tissue and non significant change in caspase-3 activity. The lowest DAI and histopathological score have been recorded in the group treated by the colon-specific delivery resveratrol formula. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects of resveratrol could be attributed to its inhibitory effect on sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) providing a useful therapeutic tool to break the link between inflammation and carcinogenesis risk in ulcerative colitis.
We describe a patient with a liver abscess due to Entamoeba histolytica, in whom metronidazole therapy (total dose, 21 g over 14 days) was complicated by reversible deafness, tinnitus, and ataxia and who relapsed 5 months later with a splenic abscess. Two courses of tinidazole (the second in combination with percutaneous aspiration of the abscess) were required to achieve cure.
We present a case of 52 years old woman with cutaneous lupus erythematosus and methimazole induced bone marrow aplasia with agranulocytosis and liver damage.
Minocycline, a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline, displays beneficial activity in neuroprotective in models including, Parkinson disease, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease and stroke. The mechanisms by which minocycline inhibits apoptosis remain poorly understood. In the present report we have investigated the effects of minocycline on mitochondria, due to their crucial role in apoptotic pathways. In mitochondria isolated suspensions, minocycline failed to block superoxide-induced swelling but was effective in blocking mitochondrial swelling induced by calcium. This latter effect might be mediated through dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and blockade of mitochondrial calcium uptake. Consistently, minocycline fails to protect SH-SY5Y cell cultures against reactive oxygen species-mediated cell death, including malonate and 6-hydroxydopamine treatments, but it is effective against staurosporine-induced cytotoxicity. The effects of this antibiotic on mitochondrial respiratory chain complex were also analyzed. Minocycline did not modify complex IV activity, and only at the higher concentration tested (100 microM) inhibited complex II/III activity. Other members of the minocycline antibiotic family like tetracycline failed to induce these mitochondrial effects.
The anti-HIV therapeutic dideoxyinosine (ddI) has been reported to produce a painful, dose-limiting peripheral myelinopathy in HIV-infected patients after chronic administration. We have previously demonstrated ddI-induced myelinopathy in a non-HIV-infected rat model after 20 weeks of dosing, characterized by myelin splitting and intramyelin edema. The present study examined the time course needed to produce the ddI-induced neuropathy. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with vehicle or 415 mg/kg ddI twice daily for up to 20 weeks. Groups of treated (n = 6-8) and control (n = 3-5) animals were killed after 5, 10, 15, and 20 weeks of dosing and the distal end of the sciatic nerve was removed. The nerve was postfixed by immersion in neutral phosphate-buffered formalin, dehydrated in graded alcohols, and embedded in plastic embedding media. One-micrometer-thick sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue and basic fuchsin. Plasma levels of ddI on the day the animals were killed were greater than 10 microgram/ml within the first hour after dosing and fell rapidly to less than 1 microgram/ml (clinical range 1-2 microgram/ml) within 3 h after dosing. The abnormalities observed in the sciatic nerve were few, if any, after 5 or 10 weeks, but very prominent after 15 weeks of dosing. Four of the six ddI-treated rats exhibited abnormal morphology as evidenced by myelin splitting and ballooned myelin sheaths. Although abnormal morphology was present at 20 weeks of dosing, the effect was not as robust as at 15 weeks. This suggests that the nerve may partially recover from the effects of ddI with time.

Insulin resistance is the physiopathologic foundation of metabolic syndrome. TRB3 has been revealed to be involved in insulin resistance in the liver by interacting directly with Akt and blocking its activation. Our investigation aims at exploring the relationship between metabolic syndrome and TRB3 mRNA expression in adipose tissue of rats. Two groups were studied as follows: the control group (CONTROL, n = 12) was fed a standard rodent chow, and the experimental group (Fructose n = 9) was fed a high-fructose diet. Body weight and systolic blood pressure were measured per 4 weeks. At the end of 38 weeks, levels of tribbles mRNAs in adipose tissue were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Akt/phospho-Akt expression was assessed by Western blot. Results show that levels of TRB1-3 mRNAs were expressed in adipose tissue of rats of both groups, and tribbles mRNAs were TRB1 (CONTROL: 0.00515, Fructose: 0.00497), TRB2 (CONTROL: 0.02104, Fructose: 0.01988), and TRB3 (CONTROL: 0.00457, Fructose: 0.00822), respectively. Of the three, TRB3 mRNA alone significantly increased by 94% in adipose tissue of fructose-fed rats compared with those in adipose tissue of the controls (P<0.05), and there was significant positive correlation between TRB3 mRNA levels and HOMA-R in fructose group (r = 0.68, P<0.05). Western blot analysis showed that phospho-Akt (Ser-473) expression was significantly decreased in adipose tissue of fructose-fed rats compared with controls (P<0.001). The present study suggests that TRB3 may be involved in metabolic syndrome by inhibiting activation of Akt in adipose tissue.
The occurrence of a functional relationship between the release of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, two inducible pro-inflammatory biomarkers with important pro-angiogenic effects, has recently been inferred. While brain endothelial cells play an essential role as structural and functional components of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), increased BBB breakdown is thought to be linked to neuroinflammation. Chemopreventive mechanisms targeting both MMPs and COX-2 however remain poorly investigated. In this study, we evaluated the pharmacological targeting of Sirt1 by the diet-derived and antiinflammatory polyphenol resveratrol. Total RNA, cell lysates, and conditioned culture media from human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were analyzed using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and zymography respectively. Tissue scan microarray analysis of grade I-IV brain tumours cDNA revealed increased gene expression of Sirt-1 from grade I-III but surprisingly not in grade IV brain tumours. HBMEC were treated with a combination of resveratrol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a carcinogen known to increase MMP-9 and COX-2 through NF-κB. We found that resveratrol efficiently reversed the PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion and COX-2 expression. Gene silencing of Sirt1, a critical modulator of angiogenesis and putative target of resveratrol, did not lead to significant reversal of MMP-9 and COX-2 inhibition. Decreased resveratrol inhibitory potential of carcinogen-induced IκB phosphorylation in siSirt1-transfected HBMEC was however observed. Our results suggest that resveratrol may prevent BBB disruption during neuroinflammation by inhibiting MMP-9 and COX-2 and act as a pharmacological NF-κB signal transduction inhibitor independent of Sirt1.
Transgenic mice that overexpress cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selectively in podocytes are more susceptible to glomerular injury by adriamycin and puromycin (PAN). To investigate the potential roles of COX-2 metabolites, we studied mice with selective deletion of prostanoid receptors and generated conditionally immortalized podocyte lines from mice with either COX-2 deletion or overexpression. Podocytes that overexpressed COX-2 were virtually indistinguishable from wild-type podocytes but were significantly more sensitive to PAN-induced injury, produced more prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2), and had greater expression of prostaglandin E(2) receptor subtype 4 (EP(4)) and thromboxane receptor (TP). Treatment of COX-2-overexpressing podocytes with a TP antagonist reduced apoptosis, but treatment with an EP(4) antagonist did not. In contrast, podocytes from COX-2-knockout mice exhibited increased apoptosis, markedly decreased cell adhesion, and prominent stress fibers. In vivo, selective deletion of podocyte EP(4) did not alter the increased sensitivity to adriamycin-induced injury observed in mice overexpressing podocyte COX-2. In contrast, genetic deletion of TP in these mice prevented adriamycin-induced injury, with attenuated albuminuria and foot process effacement. These results suggest that basal COX-2 may be important for podocyte survival, but overexpression of podocyte COX-2 increases susceptibility to podocyte injury, which is mediated, in part, by activation of the thromboxane receptor.
The chronic administration of phenothiazines has come under increasing scrutiny recently, and the uncritical use of this form of treatment has been criticized. A case is presented illustrating the development of schizophrenia in a young adult following withdrawal from phenothiazines. As far as could be ascertained ther was no evidence of schizophrenia prior to withdrawal of phenothiazines. The possibility that withdrawal of phenothiazines may have aetiological significance in this case is discussed.
Combined exposures to maternal lead (Pb) and prenatal stress (PS) can act synergistically to enhance behavioral and neurochemical toxicity in offspring. Maternal Pb itself causes permanent dysfunction of the body's major stress system, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. The current study sought to determine the potential involvement of altered negative glucocorticoid feedback as a mechanistic basis of the effects in rats of maternal Pb (0, 50 or 150 ppm in drinking water beginning 2 mo prior to breeding), prenatal stress (PS; restraint on gestational days 16-17) and combined maternal Pb+PS in 8 mo old male and female offspring. Corticosterone changes were measured over 24 h following an i.p. injection stress containing vehicle or 100 or 300 microg/kg (females) or 100 or 150 microg/kg (males) dexamethasone (DEX). Both Pb and PS prolonged the time course of corticosterone reduction following vehicle injection stress. Pb effects were non-monotonic, with a greater impact at 50 vs. 150 ppm, particularly in males, where further enhancement occurred with PS. In accord with these findings, the efficacy of DEX in suppressing corticosterone was reduced by Pb and Pb+PS in both genders, with Pb efficacy enhanced by PS in females, over the first 6 h post-administration. A marked prolongation of DEX effects was found in males. Thus, Pb, PS and Pb+PS, sometimes additively, produced hypercortisolism in both genders, followed by hypocortisolism in males, consistent with HPA axis dysfunction. These findings may provide a plausible unifying biological mechanism for the reported links between Pb exposure and stress-associated diseases and disorders mediated via the HPA axis, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, schizophrenia and depression. They also suggest broadening of Pb screening programs to pregnant women in high stress environments.
Changes in heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure were measured after extubation in 60 ASA Grade I and II patients to assess the effects of diltiazem (0.2 mg kg-1), verapamil (0.05 mg kg-1) and metoprolol (0.02 mg kg-1) given as a bolus 2 min before tracheal extubation. All the haemodynamic variables measured increased significantly after extubation in the control and diltiazem groups when compared with the base-line recordings (P < 0.05). Metoprolol effectively blocked the increases in heart rate after extubation and the increase in blood pressure in this group was less when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Verapamil alleviated the increase in both heart rate and blood pressure. However, profound hypotension and bradycardia requiring therapy, occurred in the verapamil group. For this reason, careful observation is necessary when using verapamil and the routine use of this drug in patients with coronary artery disease requires further studies.
The antiarrhythmic effect of intravenous disopyramide phosphate was assessed in a multicentre open study of 141 patients admitted to coronary care units. Disopyramide was administered in a bolus dose of 2 mg/kg over 10 min with an optional second bolus of 1 mg/kg and infusion of 0.4 mg/kg hour. Atrial fibrillation was terminated in 57% of 56 patients, supraventricular tachycardia in 82% of 11 patients, ventricular tachycardia in 88% of 17 patients and premature ventricular contractions were controlled in 85% of 55 patients. Atrial flutter was terminated in only 2 of 17 patients (12%). Side effects occurred in 38% of the patients, the most frequent being those relating to anticholinergic properties of the drug (15%) or systemic hypotension (13%). Occasionally worsening of the arrhythmia (4%), QRS widening (3) or apparent hypertension (2%) were noted. It was concluded that intravenous disopyramide is an effective antiarrhythmic agent in the coronary care unit setting, but that side effects require close monitoring of dosage.
The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is limited by their toxicity. We evaluated the anti-inflammatory efficacy and safety of three novel modified NSAIDs, phospho-aspirin, phospho-ibuprofen and phospho-sulindac.
We determined the anti-inflammatory effects and gastrointestinal safety of the phospho-NSAIDs in the rat adjuvant arthritis model and studied their mechanism of action in cultured cells, Cytokines were measured with elisa and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by immunohistochemistry.
All three phospho-NSAIDs showed less gastrointestinal toxicity than their parent compounds and demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory effects, essentially reversing joint inflammation and oedema. They have a broad but not uniform effect on the expression of relevant cytokines, in general decreasing IL-6 and IL-1β and increasing IL-10 levels in rat plasma and cultured cells. Phospho-sulindac and phospho-ibuprofen but not phospho-aspirin suppressed PGE(2) production in vitro, whereas phospho-aspirin (in contrast to aspirin) showed the same effect in vivo. In joint tissues, phospho-aspirin inhibited NF-κB activation, and suppressed inflammation and bone resorption. Phospho-aspirin also inhibited Jurkat T cell proliferation. In general, phospho-aspirin had greater efficacy but different effects upon inflammatory mediators compared with aspirin. The chemical modification of the parent NSAIDs seems crucial for their safety and efficacy.
Phospho-aspirin, phospho-ibuprofen and phospho-sulindac were safer than their parent NSAIDs, were highly effective in rat adjuvant arthritis and inhibited many key mediators in the pathophysiology of RA. These novel compounds are promising candidate drugs for the treatment of RA and merit further evaluation.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The substituted benzamide, metoclopramide, is a dopamine receptor antagonist and is widely prescribed in the symptomatic treatment of nausea and vomiting, although it can cause adverse motor and non-motor side effects. The effects of metoclopramide on brain metabolism have not been investigated to date. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH To determine the effects of metoclopramide on brain function, cerebral perfusion changes after a single oral dose were assessed in healthy volunteers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion MRI was used to measure cerebral blood flow before and after metoclopramide. Blood haemodynamics in the vertebral and internal carotid arteries were evaluated using phase-contrast MRI. KEY RESULTS Metoclopramide altered haemodynamics in the carotid arteries and the cerebral perfusion. Perfusion increased bilaterally in the putamen, consistent with antagonism of dopamine D(2) receptors by metoclopramide and possibly related to its motor side effects. In contrast, reduced perfusion was observed in the insular cortices and anterior temporal lobes. In addition, functional connectivity between the insular cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was decreased. These cortical changes affecting neural circuits between high-order association areas may underlie certain neuropsychiatric conditions occasionally reported after metoclopramide administration. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The present results show the sensitivity of ASL to detect small changes in regional blood flow, closely related to brain function, after a single pharmacological challenge, highlighting the potential of this technique for human pharmacological studies.
Cocaine addiction appears to be associated with a drug-induced dysregulation of stressor responsiveness that may contribute to further cocaine use. The present study examined alterations in stressor-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in rats provided daily access to cocaine for self-administration (SA) under long-access conditions (1.0 mg/kg/infusion; 6 hx14 days). Cocaine self-administering rats displayed reduced basal plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels but showed an augmented restraint-induced percent increase response from baseline compared to saline self-administering controls when measured 24 days after SA testing. This augmented CORT response may have been attributable to impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated feedback regulation of HPA function, since cocaine self-administering rats were also less susceptible to dexamethasone (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.) suppression of plasma CORT levels. GR protein expression measured using Western blot analysis was significantly reduced in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (including the paraventricular nucleus [PVN]) but not in the pituitary gland, ventromedial hypothalamus, dorsal hippocampus, ventral subiculum, medial prefrontal cortex or amygdala in cocaine self-administering rats. Surprisingly, basal corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA or post-restraint increases in CRH mRNA measured at a single (90 min) time-point in the PVN using in situ hybridization did not differ between groups. The findings suggest that cocaine use produces persistent changes in individual responsiveness to stressors that may contribute to the addiction process.
Oncogenic fusion genes consisting of EML4 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are present in a subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancers, representing 2 to 7% of such tumors. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase.
After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy.
Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72%, with no median for the study reached. The drug resulted in grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects.
The inhibition of ALK in lung tumors with the ALK rearrangement resulted in tumor shrinkage or stable disease in most patients. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00585195.).
We previously reported that MEEK, a generic product of vancomycin hydrochloride (VCM), was less nephrotoxic than a conventional preparation (S-VCM) in normal rats at a nephrotoxic dose (400 mg/kg) of VCM.(1)) To infer the clinical significance of this finding, we compared the risk of nephrotoxicity of these two formulations in rats with chronic renal failure in this study. MEEK or S-VCM was given intravenously to two weeks post-5/6 nephrectomy rats, and the pharmacokinetic profile of VCM and pathological evaluation were compared. There were no differences at the daily clinical dose (40 mg/kg), but at the twice the daily clinical dose (80 mg/kg), the mean plasma concentration of VCM was higher after S-VCM administration than after MEEK and the CL(tot) and CL(r) decreased to approximately 60% of those after MEEK. The renal tissue concentration of VCM was 1.5-fold higher at 24hr after S-VCM administration than after MEEK. Pathologically, no marked differences between the findings were observed at 24hr after administration of each formulation. These findings suggest that MEEK reduces renal damage caused by VCM and prevents the iatrogenic aggravation of nephrotoxicity. These results hold out hope that MEEK will permit high-dose administration of VCM, while revealing clinical significance of the nephrotoxicity-reduction by MEEK.
In this study, the effect of the 80% ethanolic extract of corn bran (EECB) on inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells was investigated. The EECB inhibited LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner. Four hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HADs), including two free cinnamic acids, p-coumaric acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA), and their conjugate phenolic amides, p-dicoumaroyl-putrescine (DCP) and diferuloylputrescine (DFP), were found to be present in the EECB by LC-MS analysis, and DFP (378.66 μg/g) was the predominant phenolic compound, followed by DCP (7.83 μg/g)>CA (5.58 μg/g)>FA (1.84 μg/g). The four HADs significantly inhibited NO production and iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner. Among the four HADs tested, DFP showed the most potent inhibition on NO production and iNOS mRNA and protein expression, followed by DCP>FA ≥ CA. DFP also exhibited the strongest inhibition on LPS-induced iNOS and NF-κB luciferase activity, which was followed by DCP ≥ FA (CA)>CA (FA). Thus, these results suggest that phenolic amides in the corn bran may be a potential source of natural anti-inflammatory agents.
Transient left ventricular (LV) ballooning syndrome, or Takotsubo syndrome, is characterized by a reversible LV dysfunction. The pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated, but an excess of catecholamines seems to have an essential role. The case of a 27-year-old man who developed transient LV dysfunction resembling Takotsubo syndrome after self-injection of adrenaline is described. The present case may provide additional evidence to the hypothesis of excess sympathetic activation in LV ballooning syndrome.
