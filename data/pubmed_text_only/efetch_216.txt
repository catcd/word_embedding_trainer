Among the neurocognitive impairments reported as associated with prenatal cocaine exposure, slower response time, and less efficient learning in school-aged children are common to findings from several laboratories. This study presents performance data on a spatial working memory task in 75 prenatally cocaine exposed (CE) and 55 nondrug-exposed (NDE) 8- to 10-year-old children.
Children were administered a novel neuropsychological measure of immediate- and short-term memory for visuospatial information, the Groton Maze Learning Test (GMLT), a computer-based hidden maze learning test that consists of a "timed chase test" (a simple measure of visuomotor speed), eight learning trials followed by a delayed recall trial after an 8-minute delay and a reverse learning trial. Performance is expressed as correct moves per second and number of errors per trial.
Across all trials, the cocaine-exposed group showed significantly slower correct moves per second and made significantly more errors. There were no significant main effects for amounts of alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana exposure. After an 8-minute delay and compared to the eighth trial, cocaine-exposed children showed less consolidation in learning compared to nonexposed children. When asked to complete the maze in reverse, cocaine-exposed children showed a greater decrement in performance (decreased correct moves per second and increased errors) compared to the eighth learning trial.
Children exposed in utero to cocaine exhibit a possible impairment in procedural learning and diminished efficiency in creating and accessing an internal spatial map to master the hidden maze.
To evaluate the frequency and severity of occurrence of vincristine-associated neurotoxicity.
A retrospective case series study.
Hurlingham Oncology Clinic, Nairobi.
Thirty-eight patients treated for various neoplasms with vincristine containing chemotherapeutic regimens.
The frequency and degree of neurotoxicity when vincristine was given at the standard dose of 1.4 mg/m2.
Five patients (13.2%) developed peripheral neuropathy, one having had it even before vincristine was started. Therefore only four (10.5%) had it attributed to vincristine. Four of the patients who developed neuropathy (80%) were HIV-positive. Neuropathy grade 2 (severe) occurred in only two patients leading to discontinuation of the drug. All the neurotoxicity resolved after discontinuation of vincristine.
Vincristine induced neuropathy occurred but was rarely severe at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2. It appeared to be more frequent in HIV infected individuals, but controlled studies with bigger sample sizes are required to determine whether this may warrant routine capping of the dose at a maximum of 2 mg.
Four new antiretroviral medications, efavirenz, abacavir, adefovir dipivoxil, and amprenavir, are expected to be approved for use in 1998. All four drugs target the same viral enzymes, HIV reverse transcriptase and HIV protease, as agents in current use. Their introduction allows greater choices in the setting of intolerance to other drugs and enhances potency, hopefully leading to greater durability of combination regimens against the virus. Their primary use will be in antiretroviral naive patients or those with limited prior treatment. The dosage regimens and limitations are described for each drug.
A 75-year-old woman taking the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) presented with acute Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia and subsequently developed renal failure. A drug-dependent antibody specific for red blood cells (RBCs) could not be demonstrated by in vitro testing with DCF. However, her serum was found to contain an IgM antibody that reacted strongly with RBCs in the presence of urine from any of four subjects who had ingested DCF. The active substance in urine was isolated, subjected to high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis, and found to be a glucuronide conjugate of a known DCF metabolite, 4'-hydroxydiclofenac (4'-OH DCF). Negative results were obtained with four other DCF metabolites. Two 4'-OH DCF glucuronides were synthesized in vitro using a liver microsomal system. One promoted agglutination of normal RBCs by the patient's serum and was identified as the glucuronide ester of 4'-OH DCF by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Studies with a panel of RBCs showed that the patient's antibody reacted preferentially with the e antigen of the Rh system. Acute immune hemolytic anemia in this patient appears to have been caused by sensitization to DCF modified by 4' hydroxylation and glucuronidation. This is the first reported example of immune cytopenia caused by sensitivity to a glucuronide conjugate of a drug metabolite. Since glucuronidation is a common pathway of drug metabolism, studies of the frequency with which glucuronide derivatives of primary medications cause immune cytopenia seem warranted.
Recent data from the DAHANCA (Danish Head and Neck Cancer) 2 study implies a positive effect of high hemoglobin concentration in concert with misonidazole for the treatment of head and neck cancers by radiotherapy. We have therefore reviewed and updated our analysis of RTOG protocol 79-15, which included the effect of misonidazole plus radiotherapy in a presumably similar population. Despite additional follow-up and more sophisticated analysis, our analysis does not demonstrate an influence of hemoglobin concentration on any of the outcome measures we examined. Possible explanations for the difference in findings of RTOG 79-15 and DAHANCA 2 are discussed.

The cardiac toxicity of antimalarial agents is rare, it includes conduction disorders which can be complicated by third atrioventricular block and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We report two observations of patients who presented a complete heart block after several years of treatment by chloroquine.
Two patients followed for rheumatoid polyarthritis, treated by antimalarial agents for average 12 years and corticotherapy, presented a syncopal complete heart block which required an implantation of a pace maker. After having eliminated all the other underlying causes for complete heart block, the antimalarial agents were accused and were stopped. The clinical evolution after interruption of the treatment was favorable.
Our observations illustrate rare cardiac side effects observed in our two patients after long-term treatment by antimalarial agents. The diagnosis of antimalarial agents responsibility was retained on clinical and biological arguments after having eliminated the other causes. The insidious character of these complications imposes vigilance during the use of long-term treatment by antimalarial agents.
A 37-yr-old woman with RF-positive RA developed cholestatic hepatitis after 10 days of D-penicillamine therapy. This was discontinued immediately. The cholestasis persisted for the remaining 14 months of her life. Severe hypercholesterolemia developed with xanthelasmata and eventually pancytopenia, which was caused by a massive infiltration of the bone marrow by lipid-containing foam cells. The patient died of sepsis. Review of the literature shows intrahepatic cholestasis to be a rare and idiosyncratic complication of D-penicillamine therapy. To our knowledge, ours is the first documented case of persistent cholestatic icterus.
The aim was to explore efficacy of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors in attenuating increases in anorexia and ubiquitin proteasome pathway transcripts in cardiac cachexia, a potentially lethal condition that responds poorly to current treatments. Cardiac cachexia was rapidly induced with monocrotaline in Sprague-Dawley rats. Either soluble TNF receptor-1 or the general inhibitor of TNF production, pentoxifylline, was given to diminish TNF action on the first indication of cachexia. Animals were anesthetized with a ketamine-xylazine-acepromazine cocktail, and then skeletal muscles were removed for subsequent measurements including ubiquitin proteasome pathway transcripts and Western blots. Both soluble TNF receptor-1 and pentoxifylline attenuated losses in both body and skeletal muscle masses and also reduced increases in selected ubiquitin proteasome pathway transcripts. The action of soluble TNF receptor-1 was partly through reversal of reduced food consumption, while the effects of pentoxifylline were independent of food intake. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that attenuation of anorexia by soluble TNF receptor-1 treatment in monocrotaline-induced cardiac cachexia is responsible for attenuating increases in some ubiquitin proteasome pathway transcripts as well as preserving body mass and attenuating loss of skeletal muscle mass.
A 33-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis developed resistance to prednisolone-azathioprine treatment. A switch to cyclosporin A resulted in immediate remission which was maintained for more than one year. No significant side effect was encountered. Cyclosporin A may be an alternative treatment for patients with autoimmune hepatitis who are resistant to conventional treatment.
Gingerol (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae) is one of the most frequently and heavily consumed dietary condiments throughout the world. The oleoresin from rhizomes of ginger contains [6]-gingerol (1-[4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl]-5-hydroxy-3-decanone) and its homologs which are pungent ingredients that have been found to possess many interesting pharmacological and physiological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antihepatotoxic and cardiotonic effects. However, the effects of [6]-gingerol on metastatic processes in breast cancer cells are not currently well known. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects of [6]-gingerol on adhesion, invasion, motility, activity and the amount of MMP-2 or -9 in the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line. We cultured MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of various concentrations of [6]-gingerol (0, 2.5, 5 and 10 microM). [6]-Gingerol had no effect on cell adhesion up to 5 microM, but resulted in a 16% reduction at 10 microM. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with increasing concentrations of [6]-gingerol led to a concentration-dependent decrease in cell migration and motility. The activities of MMP-2 or MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 cells were decreased by treatment with [6]-gingerol and occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The amount of MMP-2 protein was decreased in a dose-dependent manner, although there was no change in the MMP-9 protein levels following treatment with [6]-gingerol. MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression were decreased by [6]-gingerol treatment. In conclusion, we have shown that [6]-gingerol inhibits cell adhesion, invasion, motility and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines.
Amphetamine-induced psychosis is most often associated with a high-dose multiple binge pattern of stimulant abuse. To simulate these conditions in rats, we used an escalating dose/binge administration paradigm. Animals were pretreated with escalating doses of amphetamine (1.0-8.0mg/kg) over four days, then exposed to nine daily binges (8.0mg/kg every 2h; four injections/day). Other animals received either multiple injections of saline, saline followed by acute amphetamine (8.0mg/kg) or single daily injections of amphetamine (8.0mg/kg) in parallel with the escalating dose/binge treatment. One hour after the last injection, all animals were decapitated and regional brain activation patterns were assessed using in situ hybridization with antisense probes for zif268. Acute amphetamine resulted in a significant elevation of zif268 messenger RNA in both the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum. However, whereas after single daily amphetamine treatment this index was no longer elevated above control levels in the dorsal striatum, multiple binge exposures were required for the nucleus accumbens to return to baseline. Agranular insular cortex and medial olfactory tubercle zif268 messenger RNA expression was also markedly increased after acute amphetamine treatment but, unlike the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, this increase was not significantly attenuated by either single daily injection or multiple binge treatment. Zif268 messenger RNA expression in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala also remained elevated above baseline after binge treatment. The possible relationships of these changes in zif268 messenger RNA regional expression patterns to the development of psychosis in high-dose stimulant abusers are discussed.
To determine whether the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) monotherapy in subjects of African origin is determined by genetic variants within the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene.
A total of 194 hypertensive patients of African ancestry were recruited from district clinics in Johannesburg, South Africa. Eighty patients received open-label ACEI (enalapril or lisinopril) monotherapy, and 114 open-label calcium antagonist (nifedipine) as a drug class comparator. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was performed at baseline (off medication) and after 2 months of therapy. DNA was analysed for functional variants (-217G-->A and -20A-->C) of the AGT gene. The impact of genotype on ABP responses to ACEI monotherapy or calcium antagonists; and on plasma aldosterone and renin levels after ACEI monotherapy was assessed.
Adjusting for baseline ABP and type of ACEI in the ACEI-treated group, the -217G-->A variant predicted ABP responses to ACEI (n = 77; P < 0.01), but not to nifedipine (n = 108). ACEI in patients with the AA genotype of the -217G-->A variant failed to elicit an antihypertensive response [change in ABP, mmHg: systolic blood pressure (SBP) +0.84 +/- 2.89, P = 0.78; diastolic blood pressure (DBP) -0.47 +/- 1.74, P = 0.79]. In contrast, those patients with at least one copy of the -217G allele developed a 7.23 +/- 1.55 and 5.38 +/- 1.12 mmHg decrease (P < 0.0001) in SBP and DBP, respectively, after ACEI administration. Similarly, the -20A-->C variant predicted ABP responses to ACEI monotherapy (P < 0.01) but not to nifedipine. Moreover, patients who were AA genotype for both variants failed to develop an antihypertensive response to ACEI (change in ABP, mmHg: SBP +1.06 +/- 3.05, P = 0.73; DBP -0.39 +/- 1.83, P = 0.83); whereas patients with at least one copy of both the -217G and the -20C allele developed substantial decreases in ABP (change in ABP, mmHg: SBP -14.08 +/- 3.72, P < 0.0001; DBP -9.62 +/- 2.74, P < 0.0001). Patients with at least one copy of the -217G allele demonstrated a significant reduction in the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (-0.098 +/- 0.035, P < 0.01), whereas in those patients who were -217AA genotype the ratio was unchanged (-0.03 +/- 0.16, P = 0.85).
Functional variants of the AGT gene contribute to the variability of antihypertensive responses to ACEI monotherapy in individuals of African ancestry, with genotype determining whether or not responses occur.
Arrhythmias and cardiac arrest have been reported during amphotericin B administration but no effective technique has been described to prevent them. I saw two patients with kala-azar resistant to sodium stibogluconate who developed cardiac arrest after amphotericin infusion (in spite of tolerating a test dose). Both had low levels of serum sodium, potassium and calcium. After these were corrected the amphotericin B was restarted and the course of treatment completed successfully. I suggest that prior to giving amphotericin B to patients with resistant kala-azar their electrolyte imbalance should be corrected.
Activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)alpha and its protective role in cardiovascular function has been reported but the exact mechanism(s) involved is not clear. As we have shown that PPARalpha ligands increased nitric oxide (NO) production and cardiovascular function is controlled by a balance between NO and free radicals, we hypothesize that PPARalpha activation tilts the balance between NO and free radicals and that this mechanism defines the protective effects of PPARalpha ligands on cardiovascular system. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was greater in PPARalpha knockout (KO) mice compared with its wild type (WT) litter mates (130+/-10 mmHg versus 107+/-4 mmHg). L-NAME (100mg/L p.o.), the inhibitor of NO production abolished the difference between PPARalpha KO and WT mice. In kidney homogenates, tissue lipid hydroperoxide generation was greater in KO mice (11.8+/-1.4 pM/mg versus 8.3+/-0.6 pM/mg protein). This was accompanied by a higher total NOS activity (46+/-6%, p<0.05) and a approximately 3 fold greater Ca2+-dependent NOS activity in kidney homogenates of untreated PPARalpha WT compared with the KO mice. Clofibrate, a PPARalpha ligand, increased NOS activity in WT but not KO mice. Bezafibrate (30 mg/kg) reduced SBP in conscious rats (19+/-4%, p<0.05), increased urinary NO excretion (4.06+/-0.53-7.07+/-1.59 microM/24 h; p<0.05) and reduced plasma 8-isoprostane level (45.8+/-15 microM versus 31.4+/-8 microM), and NADP(H) oxidase activity (16+/-5%). Implantation of DOCA pellet (20mg s.c.) in uninephrectomized mice placed on 1% NaCl drinking water increased SBP by a margin that was markedly greater in KO mice (193+/-13 mmHg versus 130+/-12 mmHg). In the rat, DOCA increased SBP and NAD(P)H oxidase activity and both effects were diminished by clofibrate. In addition, clofibrate reduced ET-1 production in DOCA/salt hypertensive rats. Thus, apart from inhibition of ET-1 production, PPARalpha activation exerts protective actions in hypertension via a mechanism that involves NO production and/or inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity.
Alcohol dependence is a heterogeneous disorder where several signalling systems play important roles. Recent studies implicate that the gut-brain hormone ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide, is a potential mediator of alcohol related behaviours. Ghrelin increases whereas a ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1A) antagonist decreases alcohol consumption as well as operant self-administration of alcohol in rodents that have consumed alcohol for twelve weeks. In the present study we aimed at investigating the effect of acute and repeated treatment with the GHS-R1A antagonist JMV2959 on alcohol intake in a group of rats following voluntarily alcohol consumption for two, five and eight months. After approximately ten months of voluntary alcohol consumption the expression of the GHS-R1A gene (Ghsr) as well as the degree of methylation of a CpG island found in Ghsr was examined in reward related brain areas. In a separate group of rats, we examined the effect of the JMV2959 on alcohol relapse using the alcohol deprivation paradigm. Acute JMV2959 treatment was found to decrease alcohol intake and the effect was more pronounced after five, compared to two months of alcohol exposure. In addition, repeated JMV2959 treatment decreased alcohol intake without inducing tolerance or rebound increase in alcohol intake after the treatment. The GHS-R1A antagonist prevented the alcohol deprivation effect in rats. There was a significant down-regulation of the Ghsr expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in high- compared to low-alcohol consuming rats after approximately ten months of voluntary alcohol consumption. Further analysis revealed a negative correlation between Ghsr expression in the VTA and alcohol intake. No differences in methylation degree were found between high- compared to low-alcohol consuming rats. These findings support previous studies showing that the ghrelin signalling system may constitute a potential target for development of novel treatment strategies for alcohol dependence.
Glucosamine-6-sulphatase (G6S), a lysosomal enzyme found in all cells, is involved in the catabolism of heparin, heparan sulphate, and keratan sulphate. Deficiency of G6S results in the accumulation of undegraded substrate and the lysosomal storage disorder mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (Sanfilippo D syndrome). Regional mapping by in situ hybridization of a 3H-labelled human G6S cDNA probe to human metaphase chromosomes indicated that the G6S gene is localized to chromosome 12 at q14. The localization of the G6S gene to chromosome 12 was confirmed using the G6S cDNA clone in Southern blot hybridization analysis of DNA from human x mouse hybrid cell lines.
In this analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of the angiotensin II receptor blocker olmesartan medoxomil in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) in hypertensive patients.
Data from seven randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 6- to 12-week efficacy trials of olmesartan 20 mg and 40 mg/day were analyzed to determine changes in trough seated SBP and PP within three cohorts: 1) total cohort (n = 1777); 2) subjects with a wide PP: that is, those with a baseline PP >55 mm Hg (n = 917); and 3) a subpopulation of patients with a wide PP and age > or = 65 years (n = 296). Statistical comparisons used least squares mean values.
In the total cohort, olmesartan 20 and 40 mg/day resulted in mean reductions in SBP of 15.1 and 17.6 mm Hg, respectively (P < .001 v placebo). In the wide PP cohort, olmesartan resulted in mean reductions in SBP of 17.7 and 22.0 mm Hg and mean reductions in PP of 7.4 Hg and 8.8 mm Hg for the groups receiving 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively (P < .001 v placebo). In the cohort with wide PP and age > or = 65 years, olmesartan 20 and 40 mg/day produced mean reductions in SBP of 21.8 and 22.5 mm Hg, and PP of 6.7 and 7.6 mm Hg, respectively (P < .05 v placebo).
Olmesartan significantly reduces SBP and PP, and these reductions are more pronounced in patients with a wide baseline PP. In patients with a wide baseline PP and age > or = 65 years, the population at greatest risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, olmesartan reduces PP to an extent similar to that in patients <65 years of age.
Antidepressants are heavily prescribed drugs and have been shown to affect inflammatory signals. We examined whether these have anti-inflammatory properties in animal models of septic shock and allergic asthma. We also analysed whether antidepressants act directly on peripheral cell types that participate in the inflammatory response in these diseases.
The antidepressants desipramine and fluoxetine were compared in vivo to the glucocorticoid prednisolone, an anti-inflammatory drug of reference. In a murine model of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced septic shock, animals received the drugs either before or after injection of LPS. Circulating levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and mortality rate were measured. In ovalbumin-sensitized rats, the effect of drug treatment on lung inflammation was assessed by counting leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavages. Bronchial hyperreactivity was measured using barometric plethysmography. In vitro production of TNF-alpha and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and presumably Secreted (RANTES) from activated monocytes and lung epithelial cells, respectively, was analysed by immunoassays. Reporter gene assays were used to measure the effect of antidepressants on the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 which are involved in the control of TNF-alpha and RANTES expression.
In the septic shock model, all three drugs given preventively markedly decreased circulating levels of TNF-alpha and mortality (50% mortality in fluoxetine treated group, 30% in desipramine and prednisolone treated groups versus 90% in controls). In the curative trial, antidepressants had no statistically significant effect, while prednisolone still decreased mortality (60% mortality versus 95% in controls). In ovalbumin-sensitized rats, the three drugs decreased lung inflammation, albeit to different degrees. Prednisolone and fluoxetine reduced the number of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils, while desipramine diminished only the number of macrophages and lymphocytes. However, antidepressants as opposed to prednisolone did not attenuate bronchial hyperreactivity. In vitro, desipramine and fluoxetine dose-dependently inhibited the release of TNF-alpha from LPS-treated monocytes. In lung epithelial cells, these compounds decreased TNF-alpha-induced RANTES expression as well as the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1.
Desipramine and fluoxetine reduce the inflammatory reaction in two animal models of human diseases. These antidepressants act directly on relevant peripheral cell types to decrease expression of inflammatory mediators probably by affecting their gene transcription. Clinical implications of these observations are discussed.
Aim of the following paper is to discuss about the possible etiopathogenetic mechanisms of inner ear damage induced by cocaine abuse. Unfortunately the data concerning this topic are very limited; the authors are then presenting a literature review, also discussing the clinical presentation and the possible therapeutical approach of a clinical case of bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss following i.v. injection of cocaine.
Case report.
A strictly audiological evaluation has been performed, in order to identify the cochlear lesion site(s) and to provide the best medical treatment.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of acute cocaine intoxication with sudden bilateral hearing loss. Further studies are required in order to understand the effects of these substances on the inner ear cells and metabolism.
In Japan, a nationwide prevention program against mother-to-infant infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) started in 1985. This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive mothers. These infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine. We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987. 93.4% pregnant women had the chance to be examined for HBsAg, and the positive rate was 1.4 to 1.5%. The HBeAg positive rate in HBsAg positive was 23 to 26%. The HBsAg positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3% and 2% respectively. Some problems may arise, because 27 to 30% of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas.
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the ameliorative role of α-eleostearic acid and punicic acid, isomers of conjugated linolenic (CLnA) acid, against oxidative stress induced DNA damage. Male albino rats were divided into six groups. Group 1 and 2 were normal control and sodium arsenite treated (Sa; 10 mg/kg BW) control respectively. Group 3-6 were orally treated with different doses of two fatty acids (0.5% and 1.0% of total lipid given for each isomer) along with sodium arsenite (Sa; 10 mg/kg BW). Comet assay of blood leukocytes showed that administration of CLnA reduced DNA damage significantly (P<0.05) which was determined by tail DNA percent and olive tail moment. Results showed that activity of antioxidant enzymes viz. catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in plasma, liver and erythrocyte lysate decreased and activity of nitric oxide synthase in plasma and liver increased significantly due to oxidative stress generated by sodium arsenite. Administration of CLnA isomers restored all the altered parameters and also reduced lipid peroxidation and leakage of transaminase enzymes from liver to blood due to liver injury. α-Eleostearic acid was more efficient antioxidant than punicic acid against oxidative DNA damage.
Two patients developed intracerebral hemorrhage within hours from first-time ingestion of phenylpropanolamine-containing medications. One patient had marked hypertension, presented with three intracerebral hematomas, and developed a fourth hemorrhage 10 days later. Angiogram in one patient revealed "beading" of intracranial arteries, an abnormality also detected in a third patient who developed severe headache, vomiting, and acute hypertension following a single dose of phenylpropanolamine. These cases and others reported in the literature strongly suggest an association between phenylpropanolamine ingestion and hemorrhagic stroke. Direct questioning of use of this medication in cases of unexplained intracranial hemorrhage in previously healthy young individuals may reveal an unsuspected high frequency of this association.
