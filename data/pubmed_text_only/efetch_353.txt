The aim of this work is to determine whether consuming tap water containing arsenic (20 microg/L) alters oxidative stress levels in female rats and changes vascular response. Whereas nitric oxide produces complete relaxation, arsenic (7 months of exposure) impairs the acetylcholine-induced endothelial relaxation in the rat aorta compared with control rats. Arsenic exposure results in a marked elevation in reactive oxygen species in blood, and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity, which is a sensitive biomarker for arsenic toxicity and oxidative stress, is significantly decreased in erythrocytes from 7-month-old rats. Diastolic blood pressure increases significantly in 7-month-old arsenic-treated versus control rats. The percentage of change in peripheral resistance increases. The results indicate that chronic environmental exposure to low levels of arsenic alters the release of vasoactive substances, causes changes in oxidative stress, and increases blood pressure in female rats.
We examined plasma arginine-vasopressin concentrations by radioimmunoassay in two brothers, aged 6 and 7.5 years, with familial central diabetes insipidus inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Plasma AVP was measured in relation to increasing plasma osmolality induced by water deprivation and hypertonic saline infusion. The brother with the more severe urinary concentrating defect had no detectable AVP when his plasma osmolality was as high as 306 mOsm/kg; the other brother had detectable but clearly subnormal AVP concentrations. The one brother tested had an apparently normal end-organ response to exogenous vasopressin. Chlorpropamide had a significant antidiuretic effect in the brother with detectable AVP levels, and a lesser effect in the other brother . Our findings suggest that intrafamilial variation in the severity of congenital DI is related to the degree of vasopressin deficiency.
This pharmaco-epidemiologic study was undertaken to determine if the combination of clozapine and valproate poses an increased risk of blood dyscrasias, liver function abnormalities, or other side effects and to develop dosing guidelines when the combination is utilized.
The charts of 55 patients receiving clozapine and valproate concurrently between May 8, 1989, and May 8, 1992, were reviewed to determine the indication for and length of time on each medication, abnormalities in liver function test results, blood cell dyscrasias, seizures, nausea, vomiting, sedation, sialorrhea, and enuresis. In addition, the efficacy of the combination was measured.
The combination of clozapine and valproate was efficacious and well tolerated in the majority of patients. Major adverse effects such as blood dyscrasias or seizures were not experienced by the study population. The side effect that led to discontinuation of the combination most frequently was sedation.
The combination of clozapine and valproate is safe and efficacious.
Oxidative stress has an important role in the pathogenesis of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced nephrotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the nephroprotective effects of fullerenol (FLR), an antioxidant agent, on DOX-induced nephrotoxicity. The investigation was carried out on adult female Sprague Dawley outbred rats with chemically induced breast cancer (1-methyl-1-nitrosourea; 50 mg/kg; ip). Rats were divided into the following groups: control healthy, control cancer, DOX alone (8 mg/kg, ip, cancer), DOX plus FLR as a pre-treatment (8 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, respectively, ip, cancer), and FLR alone (100 mg/kg, ip, cancer). At the end of the 2nd day after drug administration, blood and kidney tissues were taken for analysis. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase as serum enzymes, as well as level of malondialdehyde, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductases, catalase and superoxide dismutase, were determined. DOX caused nephrotoxicity, but FLR pre-treatment prevented oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and the disbalance of GSH/GSSG levels in kidney tissue caused by DOX. Our results confirm satisfactory nephroprotective efficacy of FLR in the acute phase of toxicity and encourage further studies regarding its use as a potential nephroprotector.
Vecuronium bromide (Norcuron, Organon, Inc., West Orange, NJ) is a common neuromuscular blocking agent used to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Cases have been reported in which prolonged use of vecuronium resulted in severe motor neuropathy, with or without myopathy. However, the time course of recovery, the functional prognosis, and the use of inpatient rehabilitation is not well-established. We are reporting the functional recovery of two cases with the diagnosis of severe vecuronium motor neuropathy and/or myopathy. The patients presented with pneumonia and meningococcemia, respectively, and received vecuronium during ventilatory support, which lead to quadriparesis. In one patient, vecuronium toxicity occurred while neuromuscular junction monitoring was in place. Significant improvement was noted during an average of 3 to 4 wk in a comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation program, documented by the improvement in total motor Functional Independence Measure scores for patient 1 (from 15 to 71) and for patient 2 (from 65 to 84). In addition, the distal compound motor amplitudes showed a 4-fold increase for the ulnar, a 7-fold increase for the median, an 11-fold increase for the peroneal, and a 3-fold increase for the tibial nerves on follow-up nerve conduction studies correlating with neurologic recovery. In summary, even when patients present with quadriparesis, the recovery after vecuronium toxicity appears to be favorable.
Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) mediates 17beta-estradiol (E2) actions through the transcription of E2-sensitive target genes. In addition, rapid non-genomic signaling (e.g., MAPK/ERK) occurs. It is now well accepted that these rapid membrane-initiated responses account for E2-related cancer. Beside many beneficial effects on human health, nutritional flavonoids exert protective and anticarcinogenic effects on E2-related cancer. The mechanism underlying these effects seems to be related to flavonoids antioxidant properties and/or to their ability to alter signal transduction protein kinases. In addition, an antiestrogenic activity has been proposed but not yet defined. However, the identification and characterization of the responsible mechanisms for flavonoid antitumoral effects is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the possibility that the antimitogenic effects of flavonoids are transduced by modulating ERalpha-mediated rapid signaling. The ability of two flavonoids, the flavanone naringenin and the flavanol quercetin, with respect of E2, to induce ERalpha activities has been studied in the human cervix epitheloid carcinoma cell line (HeLa) devoid of any estrogen receptors and rendered E2-sensitive by transient transfection with a human ERalpha expression vector. Our results indicate that flavonoids act as E2 mimetic on ERalpha transcriptional activity, whereas they impair the activation of rapid signaling pathways committed to E2-induced proliferation. The resulting decoupling of ERalpha signal transduction could be proposed as a new mechanism in the protective effects of flavonoids against E2-related cancer.
The purpose of this study was to report the efficacy of intravenous amiodarone alone or in combination with digoxin in neonates and small infants with life-threatening supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT).
We retrospectively analyzed 9 neonates and small infants with life-threatening or resistant SVT who were treated with intravenous amiodarone alone or in combination with digoxin.
This report consists of 8 patients with reentrant SVT and 1 with atrial flutter. On admission, 7 patients had a congestive heart failure and 3 of whom had cardiovascular collapse. Intravenous rapid bolus of adenosine caused a sustained sinus rhythm in 4 patients. These patients were given digoxin initially, but recurrence of persistent tachyarrhythmia necessitated the use of intravenous amiodarone in all these patients. Amiodarone was given initially to the other 4 patients in whom adenosine caused only temporary conversion to the sinus rhythm. It was effective in 2 patients. In the other 2, digoxin was added to therapy for tachycardia control. Amiodarone alone or in combination with digoxin effectively controlled reentrant SVT in all patients. This combined treatment caused ventricular rate control in patient with atrial flutter, and conversion to the stable sinus rhythm was achieved at approximately 8 months.
Intravenous amiodarone alone or in combination with digoxin was found to be safe and effective in controlling refractory and life-threatening SVT in neonates and small infants.
Halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1:1:1-trifluoroethane) is a volatile, nonflammable anaesthetic agent which has been widely used for the last 20 years. Halothane hepatitis has been a matter of continuing controversy, but now it seems to be generally accepted as a clinical entity. Characteristically the halothane hepatitis occurs after multiple exposures to halothane within short time. The pathogenesis of the liver cell damage is obscure. It is estimated that the incidence of halothane hepatitis is about one per 8000 halothane anaesthesias and the lethality about one per 40000. Prophylaxis consists of avoiding repeated halothane anaesthesias within short time and to avoid re-exposure to halothane if otherwise unexplained liver damage has occurred after halothane.
Ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa shows strong clinical efficacy against chronic hepatitis C, and is now established as the standard of care. However, the precise role of ribavirin is still being defined, suggesting that optimal ribavirin dose should be maintained over the whole treatment period. Ribavirin dosage varies by bodyweight for genotype 1 disease (1000mg/day in patients <or =75kg and 1200mg/day in patients >75kg), whereas 800mg/day is sufficient to ensure optimal response in all genotype 2/3 patients. Similarly, genotype 1 patients benefit from 48 weeks of therapy, while 24 weeks is sufficient for genotype 2/3 disease. Recent data suggest treatment success is dependent on cumulative ribavirin exposure, as patients who receive <60% of the planned dose have lower response rates, regardless of whether reductions are from temporary interruptions or premature cessation of therapy. All patients should be monitored for hemolytic anemia, as early diagnosis allows management through small dose reductions and stepwise return to the target dose, maximizing cumulative exposure. Despite these recent advances in our knowledge, many questions remain, such as whether the role of ribavirin will change or even be eliminated as new therapies are developed.
Little is known about the risks of cardiovascular disease associated with the use of smokeless tobacco, which produces blood nicotine levels similar to those caused by cigarette smoking.
Male Swedish construction industry employees (n = 135,036) who attended a health examination were followed by studying cause-specific mortality during a 12-year period. The study population comprised 6297 smokeless tobacco users, 14,983 smokers of fewer than 15 cigarettes per day, 13,518 smokers of 15 or more cigarettes per day, 17,437 ex-smokers, 50,255 "other" tobacco users, and 32,546 nonusers.
The age-adjusted relative risk of dying from cardiovascular disease was 1.4 for smokeless tobacco users and 1.9 for smokers of 15 or more cigarettes per day, compared with nonusers. Among men aged 35 through 54 years at the start of follow-up, the relative risk was 2.1 for smokeless tobacco users and 3.2 for smokers. When data were adjusted for body mass index, blood pressure, and history of heart symptoms, the results were essentially unchanged. Cancer mortality was not raised in smokeless tobacco users.
Both smokeless tobacco users and smokers face a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease than nonusers. Although the risk is lower for smokeless tobacco users than for smokers, the excess risk gives cause for preventive actions.
Two patients, a 69-year-old man and a 49-year-old woman, developed a bilateral decrease in visual acuity, the male patient within two months of starting to use amiodarone (Cordarone) and the female patient within ten months of starting to use ethambutol (Myambutol) and isoniazid. Optic neuropathy occurred in both patients and this was probably caused by the medications. After the medication had been withdrawn, the male patient's vision remained poor (1/300); 6 months later the female patient's vision had improved to 0.8 and 1.0. Before prescribing oculotoxic medications, physicians should know about the patient's visual acuity and any ocular diseases the patient may have. The patient must also be advised to contact their doctor immediately if visual complaints occur. Before and during treatment with ethambutol, ophthalmological examinations should be carried out regularly. In the event of complaints, iatrogenic optic neuropathy must be distinguished from an ischaemic optic neuropathy. The latter is usually associated with an acute unilateral decrease in visual acuity. Withdrawal of the medication is indicated for neuropathy. However, although the vision may improve it will not be completely restored.
The nature of the antagonism by anticholinergic compounds of nicotine-induced convulsion in mice has not been defined clearly. Although, because they do not compete effectively for agonist binding to brain tissue in-vitro, these compounds are thought to be non-competitive antagonists in the brain, pharmacological evidence is lacking. This study describes the anti-nicotinic properties of the clinically used anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs, benztropine, biperiden, caramiphen, ethopropazine, procyclidine and trihexyphenidyl. Nicotine-induced convulsion and arecoline-induced tremor in mice were effectively prevented by these drugs. The concentrations of benztropine, biperiden, caramiphen, ethopropazine, procyclidine and trihexyphenidyl affording 50% prevention of nicotine-induced convulsion (ED50 values) were 7.4, 4.6, 7.8, 4.9, 3.1 and 3.3 mg kg(-1), respectively. The classical muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine had potent anti-muscarinic effects but very weak anti-nicotinic activity. The classical nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine had potent anti-nicotinic activity but no anti-muscarinic effects. The pattern of shift of the dose-response curve for nicotine-induced convulsion in mice was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of the anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs. These drugs were found to increase the ED50 (0.49 mg kg(-1)) of nicotine-induced convulsion in a dose-related manner. The maximum effect of nicotine and the slope of nicotine dose-response curve were not significantly influenced by either low or high doses of benztropine, procyclidine or trihexylphenidyl, which suggests competitive action. Biperiden, caramiphen and ethopropazine, at low doses which significantly increased the ED50 of nicotine, did not affect the maximum effect of nicotine or the slope of the nicotine dose-response curve; at higher doses, however, they reduced the maximum effect and the slope, which suggests that these drugs have both competitive and non-competitive properties in antagonizing nicotine-induced convulsion in mice. The experiments demonstrate that the anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs and mecamylamine effectively antagonize nicotine-induced convulsion, but atropine does not; some of these drugs have competitive properties whereas others seem to have both competitive and non-competitive properties in antagonizing nicotine-induced convulsion in mice.
The restoration of functional connective tissue is a major goal of the wound healing process. The 72- and 92-kD gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) are extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are known to degrade type IV and V collagens and gelatin, and have a potential role in wound healing. The spatial and temporal gelatinolytic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were analyzed as a function of ulcer age, in homogenates of rat, indomethacin-induced, chronic gastric ulcers. The rats were sacrificed on 1, 3, 7, 12, 18, 24 and 28 days after subcutaneous indomethacin injections. Zymographic analyses revealed elevated activation of MMP-9 and latent and active MMP-2 in gastric ulcers, when compared to gastric tissue from non-indomethacin-treated rats. The intact tissue and tissue from ulcerous lesions contained MMP-2. The highest activity of MMP-2 was found in 3 day gastric ulcers and returned to the control level by day 24. MMP-9 was not present in the intact tissue and the highest gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 was also observed on the 3rd day after administration of indomethacin. The activity thereafter decreased and returned to the control level by day 24. In situ hybridization was used to evaluate which cells synthesize MMP-2 and MMP-9. MMP-2 was seen mostly in fibroblast-like cells in the submucosa and MMP-9 in macrophage-like cells in the mucosa on the margins of the ulcers. Thus, we conclude that these two MMPs seem to have different functions during the gastric ulcer injury/healing process. MMP-2 may participate in the physiological turnover of the gastric extracellular matrix, whereas MMP-9 may be important in the early phase of gastric ulcer formation and also in the healing process.
With an aging population, nonagenarians constitute an increasing percentage of patients with coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to determine the predictors and outcome of nonagenarians undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for symptomatic coronary artery disease.
From 2002 to 2007, a cohort of 171 consecutive nonagenarians underwent PCI and stent implantation in our center. Patients given bivalirudin (n = 79) during the procedure were compared to those given heparin (n = 92). In-hospital and 6-month rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularization were indexed. In-hospital bleedings were also indexed.
The mean age was 92.5 +/- 2.5 years. The population was 52% female. Nearly 30% of patients had diabetes mellitus and >25% had renal failure. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 45%+/- 14%. The clinical presentation was an acute MI in 59% of the cases. The in-hospital rates of death and bleedings were 4.1% and 17.5%, respectively. Clinical presentations as MI or cardiogenic shock were associated with high rates of in-hospital death: 19.3% and 30%, respectively. Bivalirudin use was associated with a 41.5% decrease in in-hospital bleedings. The 6-month incidence of MACE was 13.6% and was driven by death. Predictors of 6-month outcomes were clinical presentations as MI or cardiogenic shock, renal failure, and total stent length.
Nonagenarians represent a particular population with a high percentage of females and a high incidence of comorbidities. In this study, we highlighted that nonagenarians have logically a worse prognosis than is reported in younger patients, with especially high rates of in-hospital bleedings. Bivalirudin use was associated with an important decrease in in-hospital bleedings; thus, it should be systematically considered in such patients to improve early outcome.
In 15 patients with acute myocardial infarction intravenous pentazocine in a dose of either 30 or 60 mg. was followed by a significant increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure. In the group receiving the 60-mg. dose this change was associated with a significant increase in systemic arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance, and left ventricular minute work. Because of these circulatory effects intravenous pentazocine in a dose of 60 mg. would seem to be unsuitable for the relief of pain in myocardial infarction.
Prostaglandins are important mediators responsible for many changes that occur during the inflammatory response. Specifically, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), prostaglandins are key players in maintenance of blood flow and mucosal defense. In blood vessels, prostaglandins modulate and inhibit transmigration. In lymphatic vessels, on the other hand, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) have been shown to potently inhibit lymphatic contractility. Inhibition of lymphatic contractility could impair proper tissue fluid drainage during inflammation, consequently leading to the submucosal oedema observed in IBD. Alterations in production of PGE2 and PGI2 during inflammation could have severe implications on lymphatic and vascular functions within the small intestine. Using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced ileitis guinea pig and rat models, we assessed by quantitative PCR changes in mRNA transcript of enzymes and receptors involved in the production and actions of prostaglandins in mesenteric lymphatic and blood vessels as well as in the affected ileum. Furthermore, we also assessed lymphatic tissue levels of PGE2 and PGI2 during inflammation. We observed significant changes in lymphatic mRNA expression of COX-1, COX-2, MPGES-1, PGIS, EP4 and IP and increases in PGE2 and PGI2 in tissues of TNBS-treated animals. Changes in mRNA in blood vessels from TNBS-treated animals included differences in COX-1, COX-2, MPGES-1, PGIS, EP1, EP2 and IP expression. Prostaglandin metabolites are differentially regulated in both lymphatic and blood vessels during intestinal inflammation.
To test whether use of combined oral contraceptives containing third generation progestogens is associated with altered risk of venous thromboembolism.
Matched case-control study.
10 centres in Germany and United Kingdom.
Cases were 471 women aged 16-44 who had a venous thromboembolism. Controls were 1772 women (at least 3 controls per case) unaffected by venous thromboembolism who were matched with corresponding case for age and for hospital or community setting.
Odds ratios derived with stratified analyses and unconditional logistic regression to adjust for potential confounding variables.
Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for venous thromboembolism were: for any oral contraceptives versus no use, 4.0 (3.1 to 5.3); for second generation products (low dose ethinyl-oestradiol, no gestodene or desogestrel) versus no use, 3.2 (2.3 to 4.3); for third generation products (low dose ethinyloestradiol, gestodene or desogestrel) versus no use, 4.8 (3.4 to 6.7); for third generation products versus second generation products, 1.5 (1.1 to 2.1); for products containing gestodene versus second generation products, 1.5 (1.0 to 2.2); and for products containing desogestrel versus second generation products, 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2). Probability of death due to venous thromboembolism for women using third generation products is about 20 per million users per year, for women using second generation products it is about 14 per million users per year, and for non-users it is five per million per year.
Risk of venous thromboembolism was slightly increased in users of third generation oral contraceptives compared with users of second generation products.
Several authors have associated the cardiotoxicity of the tricyclic antidepressants with their capacity to potentiate the response to catecholamines. Trazodone is a psychotropic drug with a clinically proven antidepressant activity. It differes from the tricyclic antidepressants under several aspects (chemistry, pharmacology, mode and mechanism of action, etc.), including interactions with catecholamines. Contrary to the tricyclic antidepressants, it does not potentiate the response to catecholamines, but, instead, has an adrenolytic activity. We therefore decided to compare the cardiotoxicity of trazodone and of a tricyclic antidepressant, i.e. imipramine in the rat. The experiments were conducted on anaesthetized Long Evans rats, the drugs being administered by i.v. infusion until cardiac arrest occurred; ECG (lead II) and blood pressure (BP) were recorded at the same time. The primary effect of trazodone was its hypotensive action. ECG changes, consisting of a lengthening of the PR interval, were observed only when there was a marked drop in BP. The primary effect of imipramine, instead, consisted of disturbances in cardiac conduction. It is concluded that trazodone and imipramine produce different cardiovascular effects.
Aberrant signaling of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (MAP kinase) pathway driven by the mutant kinase BRAF(V600E), as a result of the BRAF(T1799A) mutation, plays a fundamental role in thyroid tumorigenesis. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of a BRAF(V600E)-selective inhibitor, PLX4032 (RG7204), for thyroid cancer by examining its effects on the MAP kinase signaling and proliferation of 10 thyroid cancer cell lines with wild-type BRAF or BRAF(T1799A) mutation. We found that PLX4032 could effectively inhibit the MAP kinase signaling, as reflected by the suppression of ERK phosphorylation, in cells harboring the BRAF(T1799A) mutation. PLX4032 also showed a potent and BRAF mutation-selective inhibition of cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. PLX4032 displayed low IC(50) values (0.115-1.156μM) in BRAF(V600E) mutant cells, in contrast with wild-type BRAF cells that showed resistance to the inhibitor with high IC(50) values (56.674-1349.788μM). Interestingly, cells with Ras mutations were also sensitive to PLX4032, albeit moderately. Thus, this study has confirmed that the BRAF(T1799A) mutation confers cancer cells sensitivity to PLX4032 and demonstrated its specific potential as an effective and BRAF(T1799A) mutation-selective therapeutic agent for thyroid cancer.
Comparatively little attention has been paid to the conjunctival toxicity of antibiotics administered at the time of cataract surgery. We have observed the effect of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime injection, using colour photography in a randomised single blind trial of 121 patients undergoing routine cataract surgery. Our results suggest that a hyperaemic eye is likely to occur about twice as often in patients injected with gentamicin (p less than 0.001). Gentamicin is associated with more pain postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Significant manifestations of gentamicin toxicity are conjunctival oedema and capillary closure. Cefuroxime has some theoretical advantages over gentamicin in its antibacterial spectrum.
Two cases of rapidly progressing coronary artery disease in the setting of chronic cocaine abuse are presented. One patient, a 39-year-old female, developed a significant left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis over a 10-month period and suffered an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The second patient, a 35-year-old male, developed significant progression of three vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) over 16 months and also suffered an MI temporally related to cocaine use. Though recent cocaine use is typically considered a risk factor for acute cardiac events, chronic use may contribute to the development or rapid progression of coronary artery disease in young patients.
The etiology of congenital heart defect (CHD) is commonly believed to involve the interaction of multiple environmental and genetic factors. This study aimed to explore the joint effects of the ABCB1 gene C3435T polymorphism and maternal periconceptional toxicants exposure on the CHD risk in a Han Chinese population.
An age and gender matched case-control study with standardized data collection involving 201 pairs was conducted. Periconceptional toxicants exposure was obtained through a structured questionnaire. A job exposure matrix (JEM) was used for toxicants exposure assessment. Genotyping of the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism was performed by sequencing. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the joint effects of the ABCB1 gene C3435T polymorphism and toxicants exposure on the risk of CHD. Placenta tissues and umbilical cords were collected to investigate the impact of C3435T polymorphism on the transcription and translation activities of ABCB1 gene.
MATERNAL PERICONCEPTIONAL EXPOSURES TO PHTHALATES (ADJUSTED OR: 1.6; 95%CI: 1.0-2.6) and alkylphenolic compounds (adjusted OR:1.8; 95%CI:1.1-3.0) were associated with a higher incidence of CHDs in general. More cases were carriers of the ABCB1 CC/CT genotypes (OR: 2.0, 95%CI: 1.1-3.5, P-value: 0.021). Children carrying the CC/CT genotype and periconceptionally exposed to phthalates and alkylphenolic compounds suffered almost 3.5-fold increased risk of having CHD than non-exposed children with TT genotype (adjusted OR: 3.5, 95%CI: 1.5-7.9, P-value: 0.003), and the OR changed to 4.4 for septal defects (adjusted OR: 4.4,95%CI:1.8-10.9,P-value:0.001). The ABCB1 mRNA expression of the TT genotype was significantly higher than that of the CC genotype (P = 0.03). Compared with TT genotype, lower P-glycoprotein expression was observed for the CC/CT genotypes.
The C3435T polymorphism in the ABCB1 gene of fetus increases the risks of CHD in a Han Chinese population when the mothers are exposed to phthalates and alkylphenolic compounds during the periconceptional period, particularly for septal defects.
Opioids, when administered in large doses, were reported to produce brain damage primarily in limbic system and association areas in animals. We recently found the result that intrathecal (IT) morphine after a short interval of aortic occlusion in the rodent model induced transient spastic paraparesis via opioid receptor-coupled effects in the spinal cord. Histopathological analysis revealed the possibility that IT morphine could induce degeneration of spinal ventral neurons even after a short lasting of spinal cord ischaemia in rats, and this degeneration was associated with the activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by elevation of glutamate release in cerebrospinal fluid after IT morphine. Therefore, we would like to emphasize that all anesthesiologists should be aware of the possibility of morphine-induced paraplegia after thoracic aortic surgery and that we should carefully select appropriate analgesic agents from the several available opioids for these patients.
