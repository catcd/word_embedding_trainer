It is well documented that perinatal transmission is the major cause of chronic HBV infection in China. However, the mechanisms of HBV perinatal transmission are not defined clearly. It is not known whether hepatitis B e antigen can cross the human placenta, and the rate of HBeAg decay in babies with and without HBV breakthrough has not been studied. In this study, HBV serological markers were investigated in 95 hepatitis B surface antigen positive pregnant women. These markers were also studied in the babies at birth and at the age of 6 months and 12 months. The data show that 7.4% (7/95) children were infected with HBV during the first year after birth despite receiving passive-active immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine. The surface gene fragment of HBV DNA was cloned and sequenced following PCR amplification in 7 cases of HBsAg positive babies and their mothers. All babies had the same sequences as their mothers, although two babies also had sequences that would produce an amino acid substitution within the "a" determinant. Furthermore, we measured HBeAg titers and HBV DNA levels by using Abbott AxSYM system and LightCycler-based real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR in 54 mother-infant pairs. Thirty-three mothers were HBeAg positive, and 21 mothers were HBeAg negative. Seventy percent (23/33) of neonates from HBeAg-positive mothers were HBeAg positive at birth compared with 0% (0/21) of neonates from HBeAg negative mothers. HBeAg was present at higher titer in the birth sera of the babies with HBV breakthrough than in babies without breakthrough. HBeAg was cleared from the serum in all 19 babies without breakthrough. In 17 of these 19 babies, the HBeAg was cleared within 6 months, and in two babies clearance took 12 months. The mean serum HBV DNA level in the mothers of the 4 infants with HBV breakthrough was significantly higher than in the mothers of babies who did not become infected. In conclusion, this data suggests that HBeAg can cross the human placenta, and disappears from serum within 6 months in most babies. HBV DNA levels in hepatitis B carrier mothers are associated with the failure of HBIG and vaccine immunization, and the additional influence of transmitted HBeAg cannot be excluded.
We evaluated the sensitivity of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in documenting effects of nimodipine in experimental focal cerebral ischemia. Twenty-five Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and were imaged at different intervals thereafter. Neuropathologic and neurologic data were correlated with MR imaging results. Compared with controls, nimodipine-treated rats showed a significantly smaller infarct size (p less than 0.001), as documented by MR imaging and confirmed by neuropathologic evaluations. A less intense signal on the T2 weighted sequence was found in nimodipine-treated rats in basal ganglia (p less than 0.001) and cortex (p less than 0.05). MR imaging may afford unprecedented diagnostic sensitivity in assessing pharmacologic efficacy in cerebral ischemia.
Although the potential anticancer effect of resveratrol (RSV) on pancreatic cancer has been reported, its mechanism was not fully understood. The role of vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) in cancer remains controversial. Herein, we aimed to examine whether the anticancer effect of RSV was related to the VEGF-B.
The effect of RSV on pancreatic cancer cell line (capan-2 cells) was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, Hoechst 33342 staining, and flow cytometry. The mRNA level of VEGF-B was measured by real-time PCR. VEGF-B expression was knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA).The protein levels of VEGF-B, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), and Bax were measured by Western blot.
Resveratrol treatment inhibited tumor growth, induced apoptosis, and up-regulated Bax expression in capan-2 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of VEGF-B were up-regulated after RSV treatment. However, VEGF-B siRNA treatment increased the apoptotic rate, and inhibited tumor activator GSK-3β, while Bax expression was not affected. The combination of RSV and VEGF-B siRNA showed significantly higher apoptotic rate in comparison with RSV or VEGF-B siRNA mono-treatment group.
Resveratrol plays dual roles in pancreatic cancer: as a tumor suppressor via the up-regulation of Bax; as a tumor activator via the up-regulation of VEGF-B; and the anticancer effect of RSV is much stronger than the cancer promotion effect. The combination of RSV with pharmacological inhibitor of VEGF-B might, therefore, be a promising modality for clinical pancreatic cancer therapy.
Dietary supplements have become very popular worldwide because they are believed to be safe with few side effects. Here, we report three cases of liver injury caused by Sennomotokounou, a Chinese dietary supplement for weight reduction. All patients developed acute hepatotoxicity and recovered spontaneously after withdrawal of dietary product. This product contains fenfluramine, n-nitroso-fenfluramine, and dried thyroid tissue powder. In Japan, the regulatory agency for drug and food safety received 120 reports of hepatotoxicity associated with Sennomotokounou between 2000 and 2002. Physicians should inquire about the use of dietary supplements whenever patients present with unexplained acute liver dysfunction.
Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant frequently used after solid-organ transplantation. Moderate and severe neurologic side effects have been reported in patients receiving tacrolimus. Cerebral neurotoxicity is a rare but fatal calcineurin inhibitor-related complication, especially in kidney and liver transplant recipients. Often a reduction or a change in immunosuppressive regimen is the only means of clinical management. Herein we report a case of a 31-year-old man who developed cerebellar atrophia while under immunosuppressive therapy 9 years after heart transplantation. His neurologic constitution ameliorated after an immunosuppressant switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus.
The role of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in the therapy of chronic heart failure (CHF) has not been clarified. There are no large placebo-controlled trials with these agents. The second Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly trial (ELITE-II) compared the ARB losartan with captopril in 3,152 patients >/=60 years old with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV and left ventricular ejection fraction </=40% and did not establish the efficacy of the ARB or its equivalent to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial was designed to determine whether addition of valsartan improved the outcomes of patients receiving standard therapy for heart failure, which in most cases included an ACE inhibitor.
A total of 5,010 patients with NYHA class II-IV CHF and ejection fraction <40% were assigned to receive 160 mg valsartan or placebo twice daily. The 2 coprimary end points were all-cause mortality and the composite of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure, resuscitated sudden death, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least 4 hours (with hospitalizations accounting for 94% of the nonfatal end points). Mortality was similar in the 2 groups, but the combined mortality and morbidity end point was 13.2% lower with valsartan (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.97; P.009), primarily because of a reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for CHF (13.8% v 18.2%). There were improvements in several secondary end points, including ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of CHF, and quality of life with valsartan. Of note is that analyses of subgroups defined according to background therapy at baseline showed highly significant interactions. For instance, the small subgroup of 366 patients (7%) who were not receiving ACE inhibitors had a 33% reduction in mortality and a 44% decrease in mortality and morbidity, whereas the morbidity and mortality benefit of valsartan observed in the overall trial was no longer significant in patients receiving background ACE inhibitor therapy (relative risk, 0.90; P.10). The larger subgroup of patients receiving both an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker at baseline had a statistically significant 42% increase in mortality with valsartan (P.009) and a trend toward an increase in the mortality and morbidity composite (P.10).
When added to standard therapy, valsartan has no overall effect on mortality and produces a modest (13.2%) reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, this benefit is much larger in patients not receiving concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy and statistically not significant in those who are taking ACE inhibitors. Somewhat troublesome is the finding of significant increase in mortality with valsartan in patients receiving both ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy.
Vitamin D has been used for topical treatment of psoriasis, and 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT), shown to be less calcemic, was developed for the topical treatment of psoriasis in Japan. Recently, we treated a psoriatic patient with diabetic nephropathy who developed severe hypercalcemia with exacerbation of chronic renal failure by the use of topical OCT. Analysis of the reported cases demonstrated that both the severity of psoriasis and renal dysfunction are critical factors in the induction of hypercalcemia in the topical treatment of psoriasis. Therefore, we must pay attention to the severity of psoriasis, especially when complicated by renal function impairment. Regular monitoring of Ca and renal function is essential to avoid life-threatening hypercalcemia from the topical treatment with vitamin D analogues.
Chlorpyrifos (CPF), one of the most widely-used organophosphorus (OP) insecticides in agriculture, is degraded in the field to its oxon form, chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO), which can represent a significant contaminant in exposures to adults and children. CPO is also responsible for the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition associated with CPF exposures; CPF is converted by liver CYP450 enzymes to CPO, which binds to and inhibits AChE and other serine active-site esterases, lipases and proteases. Young children represent a particularly susceptible population for exposure to CPF and CPO, in part because levels of the plasma enzyme, paraoxonase (PON1), which hydrolyzes CPO, are very low during early development. While a number of studies have demonstrated developmental neurotoxicity associated with CPF exposure, including effects at or below the threshold levels for AChE inhibition, it is unclear whether these effects were due directly to CPF or to its active metabolite, CPO. PON1 knockout (PON1-/-) mice, which lack PON1, represent a highly sensitive mouse model for toxicity associated with exposure to CPF or CPO. To examine the neurobehavioral consequences of CPO exposure during postnatal development, PON1-/- mice were exposed daily from PND 4 to PND 21 to CPO at 0.15, 0.18, or 0.25 mg/kg/d. A neurobehavioral test battery did not reveal significant effects of CPO on early reflex development, motor coordination, pre-pulse inhibition of startle, startle amplitude, open field behavior, or learning and memory in the contextual fear conditioning, Morris water maze, or water radial-arm maze tests. However, body weight gain and startle latency were significantly affected by exposure to 0.25 mg/kg/d CPO. Additionally, from PNDs 15-20 the mice exposed repeatedly to CPO at all three doses exhibited a dose-related transient hyperkinesis in the 20-min period following CPO administration, suggesting possible effects on catecholaminergic neurotransmission. Our previous study demonstrated wide-ranging effects of neonatal CPO exposure on gene expression in the brain and on brain AChE inhibition, and modulation of both of these effects by the PON1(Q192R) polymorphism. The current study indicates that the neurobehavioral consequences of these effects are more elusive, and suggests that alternative neurobehavioral tests might be warranted, such as tests of social interactions, age-dependent effects on learning and memory, or tests designed specifically to assess dopaminergic or noradrenergic function.
Nephrotic syndrome has long been treated in China with two herbs, Astragalus mongholicus and Angelica sinensis, which may have antifibrotic effects.
Rats with chronic puromycin-induced nephrosis were treated with Astragalus and Angelica 3 mL/d (n = 7) or enalapril 10 mg/kg/d (n = 7). Normal control rats (n = 7) received saline rather than puromycin, and an untreated control group (n = 7) received puromycin but no treatment. After 12 weeks, stained sections of the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium were evaluated for injury. Immunohistochemistry staining measured extracellular matrix components, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1), osteopontin, ED-1-positive cells, and alpha-actin. TGFbeta1 mRNA was assessed by in situ hybridization. Renin, ACE activity, angiotensin, and aldosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay or colorimetry. In the untreated rats, chronic renal injury progressed to marked fibrosis at 12 weeks. Astragalus and Angelica significantly reduced deterioration of renal function and histologic damage. Expressions of type III and IV collagen, fibronectin, and laminin also decreased significantly. This anti-fibrotic effect was similar to that of enalapril. The herbs had no effect on the renin-angiotensin system but did reduce the number of ED-1-positive, and alpha-actin positive cells and expression of osteopontin compared to untreated controls. The combination of Astragalus and Angelica retarded the progression of renal fibrosis and deterioration of renal function with comparable effects of enalapril. These effects were not caused by blocking the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, but associated with suppression of the overexpression of TGFbeta1 and osteopontin, reduction of infiltrating macrophages, and less activation of renal intrinsic cells [corrected].
8-Hydroxyguanine is a mutagenic base lesion produced by reactive oxygen species. The hOGG1 gene encodes a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase that can suppress the mutagenic effects of 8-hydroxyguanine by catalyzing its removal from oxidized DNA. A population-based (245 cases and 222 controls) and family-based (159 hereditary prostate cancer families) association study was performed to test the hypothesis that sequence variants of hOGG1 increase susceptibility to prostate cancer. We found that the genotype frequency of two sequence variants (11657A/G and Ser326Cys) was significantly different between cases and controls. The association with 11657A/G is confirmed and strengthened by our family-based association study. These results suggest that sequence variants in this gene are associated with prostate cancer risk, presumably through defective DNA repair function of hOGG1.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether pravastatin's prevention of aortic atherosclerosis via attenuation of IL-6 action depends on modulation of STAT3 activity. Male apoE knockout (apoE-/-) mice fed on a diet containing 1.25% cholesterol (wt/wt) were divided into pravastatin group provided with pravastatin (80 mg kg(-1) per day) and atherosclerosis group. After eight weeks, pravastatin significantly prevented atherosclerotic lesion and reduced levels of IL-6 in serum and lesion, and significantly decreased expressions of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and increased suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expressions in lesions. Our results suggested that pravastatin's aortic atherosclerosis preventing action via attenuation of IL-6 action may partially depend on modulation of STAT3 activity.
Effects of amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug that is effective in suppressing severe ventricular arrhythmias that are refractory to other antiarrhythmic drugs, were evaluated in 2 dogs with cardiac disease. One dog was a Doberman Pinscher with cardiomyopathy that developed severe thrombocytopenia after receiving amiodarone for 7 months. The second was a Giant Schnauzer with acquired mitral valve degeneration that developed regenerative anemia after receiving amiodarone for 5 months. Results of direct Coombs' tests were positive in both dogs. Adverse effects of amiodarone are numerous; in dogs, the most common adverse effects are anorexia and hepatotoxicosis. Frequent CBC and serum biochemical analyses should be performed when amiodarone is administered with the intent of continuing the drug indefinitely.
Central neurological diseases caused by beta-lactamins are usually associated with excessive dosages in patients with renal failure. Two case reports of convulsive encephalopathy in patients treated with ceftazidime, show the absolute necessity of adapted posology, in case of renal dysfunction. In one case, we could follow plasma levels of ceftazidime during hemodialysis, and calculated the pharmacokinetic parameters. We conclude that extra renal epuration is an efficient technique in case of acute ceftazidime intoxication.
Vinorelbine is currently one of the most active chemotherapeutic agents. However, it is also a moderate vesicant that is well known to cause venous irritation and phlebitis. We conducted this study to identify clinical risk factors related to the incidence of venous irritation caused by peripheral vinorelbine infusion.
Medical records were used to investigate retrospectively a total of 201 cases of non-small cell lung cancer treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen containing vinorelbine. Venous irritation was evaluated in every course and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0. Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), chemotherapeutic regimen, dose of vinorelbine and prior chemotherapy were used as clinical variables.
A total of 928 vinorelbine infusions were administered to the 201 patients, among whom venous irritation occurred in 63 (31%). The incidence of venous irritation was 28% in the normal BMI (<25) group and 45% in the high BMI (25 or more) group and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.037). There were no significant correlations between the incidence of venous irritation and the clinical variables except BMI. In the multivariate analysis BMI was also a significant independent variable that correlated with increased risk of venous irritation (P = 0.017).
Care is required when using vinorelbine to treat patients with a high BMI, especially with regard to the development of venous irritation.
S100B, a 21-kD Ca(2+) binding protein expressed in Schwann cells and astroglia, has often been reported as a promising biomarker for ischemic stroke. In addition to ischemic stroke, the peripheral S100B level may also be useful as a biomarker for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the kinetics and characterization of peripheral S100B in patients or experimental animal models with ICH have not been carefully examined. The present study investigated the kinetics and characteristics of the serum S100B level in a rat collagenase-induced ICH model. The serum S100B kinetics and the time-course of brain edema and hematoma formation were examined. Then, the correlations between the elevated serum S100B level and brain edema or hematoma formation were investigated. A transient elevation of serum S100B that peaked at 6 h after ICH induction was observed. The single measurement of serum S100B at 6 h after ICH induction was significantly correlated with brain edema formation and the maximal extent of the hematoma volumes. These results suggest the significance of serum S100B as a biomarker of brain damage resulting from ICH.
In practice, lower dose acitretin therapy (25 mg/d) seems to be better tolerated and associated with fewer abnormalities found after laboratory testing. Here we revisit the original phase 3 trials for acitretin to evaluate the evidence for low-dose therapy producing fewer adverse effects than the 50 mg/d dosage.
We retrospectively analyzed pooled data from 2 large pivotal trials, each including a randomized, placebo-controlled, 8-week double-blind phase followed by a 16-week open-label phase.
Multicenter pivotal trial of subjects in referral centers and private practice.
Subjects with severe psoriasis requiring systemic therapy were recruited according to inclusion/exclusion criteria.
During the double-blind phase, subjects received placebo or one of several fixed acitretin doses. Dose adjustment was allowed during the open-label phase, during which high-dose treatment was defined as a mean dosage of 50 mg/d and low-dose treatment was defined as a mean dosage of 25 mg/d.
The frequency of anomalies found after laboratory testing and clinical adverse events were the outcomes of interest.
Common adverse effects (dry skin, alopecia, rhinitis, etc) were 2 to 3 times more frequent in subjects receiving 50-mg/d acitretin than in those receiving 25 mg/d. Increases in hepatic enzymes and triglycerides in subjects receiving low-dose therapy were minimal compared with levels in those receiving high-dose therapy.
We have shown low-dose therapy (25 mg/d) to be an effective strategy for substantially reducing acitretin-associated adverse effects. Many adverse effects associated with acitretin therapy are dose dependent and can limit the usefulness of this potentially beneficial therapy.
The morphologic changes in the walls of hollow viscera caused by contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells were studied from autopsy and surgical specimens. The specimens studied included: esophageal spasm (corkscrew and nutcracker esophagus), contraction of the lower esophageal sphincter with marked esophageal dilatation, gaseous distension of the stomach, contraction of the gastric pylorus, bladder and anal sphincter, physiological segmental constriction of the small and large intestines, constriction and distension of the gallbladder, urinary bladder and bronchi, and postpartum contraction of the uterus. In contrast to distension, the constriction of hollow viscera shows marked reduction of the external circumference and diameter with thickening of the wall, contraction of smooth muscle cells, thickening of muscle bundles, remodeling of wall structure, and narrowing or obliteration of the lumen. Morphologic evidence of contraction of smooth muscle cells is demonstrated by varying degrees of typical lengthwise shortening of the cells and squeezing and folding of the nuclei depending on the degree of cytoplasmic contraction of the smooth muscle cells. Using these same classic morphologic signs, we have attempted to study constriction and distension of arteries and arterioles. We can demonstrate contraction of smooth muscle cells and remodeling of arterial and arteriolar walls in patients with spastic coronary artery thrombosis, cocaine-induced coronary artery thrombosis, acute constriction of mesenteric arteries with lacerations of arterial wall, and dissecting hemorrhages induced by large doses of intravenous infusion of vasoconstrictors for hemorrhagic shock, and in patients with sustained, accelerated, or malignant hypertension.
Four cases of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) associated with minocycline therapy are described. All subjects were young women being treated for acne. The durations of therapy from the onset of minocycline treatment until the diagnosis of BIH was made were 25 days, 4 weeks, 4 months and 18 months. Headache was severe in all cases. Two had intermittent visual obscurations. Papilloedema was present in each case. CT brain scans did not show any focal abnormalities other than the presence of small ventricles. Cessation of minocycline reversed the disease process though the resolution was much slower in the patient with the longest history of minocycline intake. One subject still had persisting lower nasal quadrantic field loss 6 months after cessation of minocycline. In each case the diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension related to minocycline was not made by the primary referring doctor, indicating the need for increased awareness of this cause of headache.
The effect of hyperphosphataemia on serum calcium regulation in renal failure has not been well studied in a setting in which hypercalcaemia is not parathyroid hormone (PTH) mediated. In azotemic rats with a normal serum calcium concentration, an increased dietary phosphate burden affects serum calcium regulation because of its effects on skeletal resistance to PTH, calcitriol production, and possibly intestinal calcium absorption. Our goal was to determine how hyperphosphataemia affected the development of hypercalcaemia during calcitriol-induced hypercalcaemia and PTH suppression in azotemic rats with established hyperparathyroidism.
Rats underwent a two-stage 5/6 nephrectomy or corresponding sham operations. After surgery, rats were given a high phosphate diet (P 1.2%) for 4 weeks to exacerbate hyperparathyroidism and were then changed to a normal diet (P 0.6%) for 2 weeks to normalize serum calcium values in the azotemic rats. At week 7, rats were divided into five groups and sacrificed after receiving three intraperitoneal doses of calcitriol (CTR, 500 pmol/100 g) or vehicle at 24 h intervals. The five groups and dietary phosphate content were: group 1, normal renal function (NRF)+0.6% P+vehicle; group 2, NRF+0.6% P+CTR; group 3, renal failure (RF)+0.6% P+vehicle; group 4, RF+1.2% P+CTR; and group 5, RF+0.6% P+CTR. Both the 0.6% and 1.2% phosphate diets contained 0.6% calcium.
Serum creatinine values were increased (P<0.05) in 5/6 nephrectomized rats (groups 3, 4 and 5), as were serum calcium values (P<0.05) in CTR-treated rats (groups 2, 4 and 5) and serum phosphate values (P<0.05) in CTR-treated azotemic rats (groups 4 and 5). Serum PTH values were suppressed (P<0.05) in CTR-treated hypercalcemic rats (groups 2, 4 and 5) and increased (P<0.05) in azotemic rats not given CTR (group 3). In the azotemic groups (groups 3, 4 and 5), an inverse correlation was present between serum calcium and phosphate in each group, despite a wide variation in serum calcium values. The slope of the inverse relationship between serum calcium and phosphate was steeper in CTR-treated azotemic rats on a 1.2% phosphate (group 4) diet than on a 0.6% phosphate (group 5) diet (P=0.02). Thus, for a similar increase in the serum phosphate concentration, serum calcium values decreased more in group 4 than in group 5. The independent effect of dietary phosphate on serum calcium values was also confirmed by analysis of covariance. Finally, the serum calcium concentration was shown to be greater for any given serum phosphate value in CTR-treated rats than in those not on CTR.
In azotemic rats with calcitriol-induced hypercalcaemia, the magnitude of hypercalcaemia is affected by: (i) the serum phosphate concentration; and (ii) differences in dietary phosphate content. Calcitriol administration also acts to shift upwards the relationship between serum calcium and phosphate so that a higher serum calcium concentration can be maintained for any given serum phosphate value.
Advanced glycosylation end products (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) axis is involved in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and is critical in the pathogenesis of diabetic atherosclerosis. We investigated the protective role of resveratrol against the AGE-induced impairment on macrophage lipid homeostasis. In THP-1-derived macrophages, RAGE was dose-dependently induced by AGE and played a key role in the AGE-induced cholesterol accumulation. Resveratrol markedly reduced RAGE expression via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma but not PPARalpha or AMP-activated protein kinase. Importantly, pretreatment with resveratrol significantly ameliorated AGE-induced up-regulation of scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) and down-regulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A1 and ABCG1 and thus effectively prevented the cholesterol accumulation in macrophages as shown by cellular cholesterol analysis and oil red O staining. Moreover, blockade of PPARgamma abolished all these effects of resveratrol. Collectively, our results indicate that resveratrol prevents the impairment of AGE on macrophage lipid homeostasis partially by suppressing RAGE via PPARgamma activation, which might provide new insight into the protective role of resveratrol against diabetic atherosclerosis.
The ability to modulate arousal is a critical skill with wide-ranging implications for development. In this study, the authors examined arousal regulation as a function of levels of prenatal cocaine exposure in 107 infants at 4 months of age using a "still-face" procedure. Facial expressions were coded. A greater percentage of heavily cocaine-exposed infants, compared with those who were unexposed to cocaine, showed less enjoyment during en face play with their mothers and continued to show negative expressions during the resumption of play following a period when the interaction was interrupted. This finding was independent of other substance exposure, neonatal medical condition, environmental risk, maternal contingent responsivity, and concurrent maternal sensitivity and vocalizations.
Lidocaine is a local anesthetic possessing both lipophilic and hydrophilic properties. It also acts as a surfactant. Thus, the disruption of membranes, resulting in necrosis, is one of possible mechanisms for lidocaine-induced cytotoxicity. However, lidocaine is reported to induce apoptosis. Therefore, in order to compare two mechanisms for cell death induced by lidocaine, the effects of millimolar lidocaine were examined on rat thymocytes by a flow cytometer with appropriate fluorescent probes. Lidocaine decreased the population of living cells with phosphatidylserine-exposed membranes, one of markers for early stage of apoptosis, and increased the population of dead cells without increasing that of cells with hypodiploidal DNA. Lidocaine at millimolar concentrations may deteriorate the membranes of such apoptotic living cells rather than those of intact living cells, resulting in necrosis. It is suggested that the process of apoptosis is not completed in the presence of millimolar lidocaine.
Nocardial brain abscess is a rare but severe complication in patients with malignancy. Nocardia exalbida was isolated in Japan and characterized within the genus Nocardia. We present the first report of N. exalbida brain abscess in a 63-year-old male patient with follicular lymphoma. He developed abnormal neurological findings during follicular lymphoma treatment, brain CT revealed ring-enhancing, multiloculated lesions, and N. exalbida was detected by aspiration of the lesion. He was successfully treated with trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and meropenem without craniotomy or repeat aspirations. It should be noted that such an infection can occur in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy against malignant lymphoma.
