The extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are key proteins mediating mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling downstream of RAS: phosphorylation of ERK1/2 leads to nuclear uptake and modulation of multiple targets. Here, we show that reduced dosage of ERF, which encodes an inhibitory ETS transcription factor directly bound by ERK1/2 (refs. 2,3,4,5,6,7), causes complex craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures) in humans and mice. Features of this newly recognized clinical disorder include multiple-suture synostosis, craniofacial dysmorphism, Chiari malformation and language delay. Mice with functional Erf levels reduced to ∼30% of normal exhibit postnatal multiple-suture synostosis; by contrast, embryonic calvarial development appears mildly delayed. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and high-throughput sequencing, we find that ERF binds preferentially to elements away from promoters that contain RUNX or AP-1 motifs. This work identifies ERF as a novel regulator of osteogenic stimulation by RAS-ERK signaling, potentially by competing with activating ETS factors in multifactor transcriptional complexes.
Aberrant Wnt signaling can drive cancer development. In many cancer types, the genetic basis of Wnt pathway activation remains incompletely understood. Here, we report recurrent somatic mutations of the Drosophila melanogaster tumor suppressor-related gene FAT1 in glioblastoma (20.5%), colorectal cancer (7.7%), and head and neck cancer (6.7%). FAT1 encodes a cadherin-like protein, which we found is able to potently suppress cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo by binding β-catenin and antagonizing its nuclear localization. Inactivation of FAT1 via mutation therefore promotes Wnt signaling and tumorigenesis and affects patient survival. Taken together, these data strongly point to FAT1 as a tumor suppressor gene driving loss of chromosome 4q35, a prevalent region of deletion in cancer. Loss of FAT1 function is a frequent event during oncogenesis. These findings address two outstanding issues in cancer biology: the basis of Wnt activation in non-colorectal tumors and the identity of a 4q35 tumor suppressor.
Tracheobronchial foreign body (TFB) aspiration is a life-threatening emergency for children. Knowing how to reduce the incidence of complications and mortality during the management of TFB is critically important.
Pediatric patients with TFB, who were treated in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Medical College Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, were included in this analysis during 1985 to 2007. One thousand four hundred twenty-eight patient records with TFB were retrospectively reviewed. This study mainly reported location and type of foreign body, complications, anesthesia methods, and outcome.
Among the 1428 patients, 1424 (99.72%) underwent successful removal of a foreign body by bronchoscopy. First-attempt removal was successful in 1347 whose bronchoscopy was done under general anesthesia combined with topical anesthesia and in 65 cases with inhaled anesthesia by ether combined with topical anesthesia, respectively. Second-attempt removal was successful in 12 patients whose bronchoscopy was done under inhaled anesthesia by ether combined with topical anesthesia. Foreign bodies were located in the trachea in 75 cases (5.25%), right bronchial tree in 780 patients (54.62%), left bronchial tree in 567 cases (39.71%), and bilateral bronchial tree in 6 cases (0.42%). Types of foreign body included peanuts (1244 cases, 87.12%), beans (93 cases, 6.51%), and others (91 cases, 6.37%). Tracheotomy was performed in 4 patients. Three patients (0.21%) died in this study. Four patients developed toxicity from tetracaine during topical anesthesia.
Bronchoscopy under general anesthesia augmented with topical anesthesia is a very safe and effective procedure for patient with TFB. Surgeons and anesthetists must be aware of the risk of tetracaine toxicity and other complications.
Mutations in the human adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are thought to initiate colorectal tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor function of APC is attributed primarily to its ability to regulate the WNT pathway by targeting the destruction of beta-catenin. We report here a novel role for APC in regulating degradation of the transcriptional co-repressor C-terminal-binding protein-1 (CtBP1) through a proteasome-dependent process. Further, CtBP1 suppresses the expression of intestinal retinol dehydrogenases, which are required for retinoic acid production and intestinal differentiation. In support of a role for CtBP1 in initiation of colorectal cancer, adenomas taken from individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis contain high levels of CtBP1 protein in comparison with matched, uninvolved tissue. The relationship between APC and CtBP1 is conserved between humans and zebrafish and provides a mechanistic model explaining APC control of intestinal retinoic acid biosynthesis.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a useful biomarker of the inflammatory potential of biomaterials in vitro. In this study we investigate the effects of soluble extracts from 3 selected root canal sealers (AH26, Sealapex, and N2 Universal) on COX-2 mRNA expression in cultured murine macrophage cells. Root canal sealers and the addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) both produced significant increases in COX-2 mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, both Sealapex and N2 Universal produced a synergistic 6- to 8-fold increase in COX-2 mRNA expression, whereas AH26 did not demonstrate synergy with LPS. These results suggest that LPS and certain root canal sealers have a synergistic effect on the inflammatory responses of macrophages. Under the conditions of this in vitro study, the results suggest that one potential mechanism of periapical inflammatory reactions might be the synergistic effects of certain root canal sealers on LPS-induced COX-2 expression by macrophage cells.
We studied the effect of metal mixture (MM), comprising As, Cd, and Pb, in developing female rat skeleton from gestation day 5 until postnatal day 60 (P-60). MM resulted in synergistic inhibition in viability and differentiation of osteoblasts in vitro, likely induced by reactive oxygen species. MM, administered at their most frequently occurring concentrations present in the groundwater of India, i.e., As: 0.38 ppm, Pb: 0.22 ppm, and Cd: 0.098 ppm or 10× of the ratio to developing rats, exhibited a synergistic decrease in ex vivo mineralization of bone marrow stromal (osteoprogenitor) cells. MM group showed a dose-dependent attenuation in weight and axial lengths and shortening of tibias at P-60. Furthermore, the growth plate was shortened, which was associated with shorter proliferative and hypertrophic zones, decreased parathyroid hormone-related protein and Indian hedgehog expression in the chondrocytes, reduced primary and secondary spongiosa, and hypomineralized osteoids-a major characteristic of osteomalacia. In addition, compared with the control, MM-treated rats were clearly osteopenic based on bone mineral density, microarchitecture, biomechanical strength, and particularly the biochemical profile, that suggested high turnover bone loss. Finally, in comparison to the control, the fracture-healing ability of MM group was delayed and accompanied by inferior quality of the healed bone. Together, these data demonstrated that the mixture of As, Cd, and Pb induced synergistic toxicity to developing skeleton, thereby diminishing modeling-directed bone accrual, inducing osteopenia and dampening fracture healing.
Salidroside is proven to be a neuroprotective agent of natural origin, and its analog, 2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)ethyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-pyranoside (named SalA-4g), has been synthesized in our lab. In this study, we showed that SalA-4g promoted neuronal survival and inhibited neuronal apoptosis in primary hippocampal neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and in rats subjected to ischemia by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), respectively, and that SalA-4g was more neuroprotective than salidroside. We further found that SalA-4g elevated glucose uptake in OGD-injured primary hippocampal neurons and increased the expression and recruitment of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) in ischemic brain. Signaling analysis revealed that SalA-4g triggered the phosphorylation of CREB, and increased the expression of PKA RII in primary hippocampal neurons exposed to OGD injury, while inhibition of PKA/CREB by H-89 alleviated the elevation in glucose uptake and GLUT3 expression, and blocked the protective effects of SalA-4g. Moreover, SalA-4g was noted to inhibit intracellular Ca(2+) influx and calpain1 activation in OGD-injured primary hippocampal neurons. Our results suggest that SalA-4g neuroprotection might be mediated by increased glucose uptake and elevated GLUT3 expression through calpain1/PKA/CREB pathway.
p-Dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) is widely used as a moth repellent and a space deodorant. In mice pretreated with DL-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; 2 mmol/kg or higher doses, i.p.), an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, administration of p-DCB (100-400 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in dose-dependent hepatotoxicity as judged by increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities and liver calcium concentrations and by histological examination of the liver, p-DCB alone (up to 1200 mg/kg) resulted in no hepatotoxicity. Administration of GSH monoethyl ester, which is known as a useful means for increasing organ GSH levels, protected against the hepatotoxicity caused by p-DCB in combination with BSO. Treatment with inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenases, carbon disulfide, metyrapone and piperonyl butoxide also prevented the hepatotoxicity. These results suggest that p-DCB is activated by a cytochrome P-450-dependent metabolic reaction and that the hepatotoxicity is caused by inadequate rates of detoxification of the resulting metabolite in mice depleted of hepatic GSH by BSO treatment. The liver injury was preceded by an extensive depletion of hepatic GSH but not accompanied by significant changes in hepatic contents of lipid peroxides and protein thiols.
The high incidence of esophageal cancer in the north of Iran has been associated to the consumption of opium and exposure to nitrosamines. Diethylnitrosamine has an established potential of producing experimental cancer in the esophagus and liver.
To evaluate by histopathology the effect of oral administration of morphine and diethylnitrosamine during 23 weeks on the hepatic and esophageal carcinogenesis on 176 rats.
We divided the rats into the following groups: Morph: morphine; Den: diethylnitrosamine; Den+morph: Den and morphine in the same solution; Den/morph: Den and morphine in different solutions and days.
Morphine did not promote neoplasias. The highest neoplastic incidents were found: a) in the esophagus, Den in relation to Den/morph and Den+morph (71.1%, 55.8%, and 50.0%); b) in the liver, Den and Den/morph in relation to Den+morph (73.8%, 81.4%, and 40.9%); c) higher incident of hepatic neoplasia than esophageal in Den/morph (81.4% and 55.8%). Different doses of diethylnitrosamine were ingested among the groups Den, Den/morph, and Den+morph, respectively 2.9, 2.8, and 2.3 mg/kg/day.
These results show that the morphine did not promote esophageal carcinogenesis and may have stimulated the hepatic metabolism of the first pass of the carcinogen.
Despite the great interest in nanoparticles (NPs) safety, no comprehensive test paradigm has been developed. Oxidative stress has been implicated as an explanation behind the toxicity of NPs. It is reported that sulphoraphane (SFN) present in cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli has potential to protect cells from oxidative damage and inflammation. However, protective role of SFN in nanotoxicity is not explored. We investigated the protective effect of SFN against the toxic response of copper oxide (CuO) NPs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (BALB 3T3). Results showed that CuO NPs induced dose-dependent (5-15 µg/ml) cytotoxicity in BALB 3T3 cells demonstrated by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. CuO NPs were also found to induce oxidative stress in dose-dependent manner indicated by induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) and depletion of glutathione and glutathione reductase. Co-treatment of BALB 3T3 cells with SFN (6 µM) significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity, ROS generation and oxidative stress caused by CuO NPs. Moreover, we found that co-treatment of another antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) (2 mM) also significantly attenuated glutathione depletion caused by CuO NPs but protection from the loss of cell viability due to CuO NPs exposure was not significant. We believe this is the first report showing that SFN significantly protected the BALB 3T3 cells from CuO NPs toxicity, which is mediated through generation of oxidants and depletion of antioxidants. Consequently, protective mechanism of SFN against CuO NPs toxicity was different from NAC that should be further investigated.
Sedation is often required to achieve immobilisation of small children during radiotherapy to avoid irradiation of normal tissues during the course of treatment. At the University College Hospital, Ibadan radiotherapists provide sedation for such patients with administration of parenteral and/or oral promethazine, diazepam, chlorpromazine and paraldehyde. This retrospective review of 84 children aged 1 month to 6 years who received sedation for radiotherapy over a period of twenty-one to twenty-eight days showed that 48% had complications. These included injection cellulitis (85.3%), injection abscess (4.87%), paresis of the lower limb (7.3%), aspiration pneumonia (2.4%). Anaesthetists in developing countries should be encouraged to extend their expertise in caring and resuscitation of sedated or unconscious patients to the radiotherapy unit. This will allow for the use of a wider variety of sedative agents and better monitoring as well as minimise or eradicate complications.
The authors present the case of a patient that demonstrates the long-standing use of megestrol acetate, a progesterone agonist, and its association with multiple intracranial meningioma presentation. Discontinuation of megestrol acetate led to shrinkage of multiple tumors and to the complete resolution of one tumor. Histological examination demonstrated that the largest tumor had high (by > 25% of tumor cell nuclei) progesterone-positive expression, including progesterone receptor (PR) isoform B, compared with low expression of PR isoform A; there was no evidence of estrogen receptor expression and only unaccentuated collagen expression. This is the first clinical report illustrating a causal relationship between exogenous hormones and modulation of meningioma biology in situ.
Oxidative stress, reactive oxygen (ROS), and nitrogen (RNS) species have been known to be involved in a multitude of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Both ROS and RNS have very short half-lives, thereby making their identification very difficult as a specific cause of neurodegeneration. Recently, we have developed a high performance liquid chromatography/electrochemical detection (HPLC/EC) method to identify 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), an in vitro and in vivo biomarker of peroxynitrite production, in cell cultures and brain to evaluate if an agent-driven neurotoxicity is produced by the generation of peroxynitrite. We show that a single or multiple injections of methamphetamine (METH) produced a significant increase in the formation of 3-NT in the striatum. This formation of 3-NT correlated with the striatal dopamine depletion caused by METH administration. We also show that PC12 cells treated with METH has significantly increased formation of 3-NT and dopamine depletion. Furthermore, we report that pretreatment with antioxidants such as selenium and melatonin can completely protect against the formation of 3-NT and depletion of striatal dopamine. We also report that pretreatment with peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts such as 5, 10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methyl-4'-pyridyl)porphyrinato iron III (FeTMPyP) and 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-sulfonatophenyl) porphinato iron III (FETPPS) significantly protect against METH-induced 3-NT formation and striatal dopamine depletion. We used two different approaches, pharmacological manipulation and transgenic animal models, in order to further investigate the role of peroxynitrite. We show that a selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), significantly protect against the formation of 3-NT as well as striatal dopamine depletion. Similar results were observed with nNOS knockout and copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD)-overexpressed transgenic mice models. Finally, using the protein data bank crystal structure of tyrosine hydroxylase, we postulate the possible nitration of specific tyrosine moiety in the enzyme that can be responsible for dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Together, these data clearly support the hypothesis that the reactive nitrogen species, peroxynitrite, plays a major role in METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and that selective antioxidants and peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts can protect against METH-induced neurotoxicity. These antioxidants and decomposition catalysts may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of psychostimulant addictions.
Zidovudine (3'-Azido-2', 3'-dideoxythymidine, AZT, ZDV) is routinely used as one of the component of antiretroviral therapy to prevent transmission of the HIV infection from mother to child. The drug, when given during pregnancy can give rise to myriad toxicities as reported in previous studies on human, animal and in-vitro experiments. The present study was an attempt to explore the Zidovudine teratogenesis in F1 and F2 generation of mice following initial maternal exposure to Zidovudine during pregnancy, through delivery and lactation. The F1 generation actually would have got the exposure during embryonic development and infant stages. Pregnant Swiss mice were treated orally with ZDV 50 mg/kg/day or distilled water (control), from day eighth of gestation, through delivery and continued for first ten days of lactation. The F1 generation litters were raised and mated to produce F2 generation mice. An interesting phenotype of "healthy" and "sick" was noted in F2 generation but not in the F1 generation. In F2 generation 35% died on different postnatal day during 120 days of follow up period. Chromosomal study from bone marrow of F1 and F2 showed various chromosomal aberrations. Lipodystrophy and hepatotoxicity was observed in "sick" mice. The study generated a hypothesis of recessive mutation and concludes that Zidovudine is a transplacental genotoxic agent. The result of present study therefore suggests the need to study the effect of zidovudine in human subjects for a longer period of time to rule out similar genotoxic effect.
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a potent immunosuppressive agent and might inhibit chronic rejection, at least in primates. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is high in renal transplant (RT) patients. To date, it has not been demonstrated whether MMF has any effect upon HCV viremia.
Fourteen long-term HCV(+) RT patients with chronic allograft dysfunction whose maintenance immunosuppression was based on cyclosporine, were given MMF therapy either in place of azathioprine (n=11) or in addition to baseline therapy (n=3). HCV viremia levels were measured by the Amplicor HCV-Monitor RT-PCR assay (Roche Diagnostic Systems) on two separate occasions before the introduction of MMF, and 1 year after changing to MMF or at the last follow-up visit.
MMF therapy was associated with a significant rise in HCV viremia, i.e., 5.8+/-0.5 vs. 5.2+/-0.7 log copies/ml (P=0.01), although there were no significant changes in liver enzymes. The increase in HCV viremia was not related to HCV genotypes either. At the patient level, HCV RNA concentrations changed in only seven patients (group B), i.e. >1 log copies/ml, whereas it remained stable in the others (group A). Before conversion, the only significant difference between group A and B was the level of HCV RNA, i.e., 5.5+/-0.4 log copies/ml in group A and 4.9+/-0.7 log copies/ml in group B (P=0.05).
Our study suggests that MMF should be used with caution in stable HCV RT patients whose maintenance immunosuppressive therapy is based on cyclosporine, at least in the case of patients with a low HCV RNA titer.
Piperacillin is being used with increasing frequency as an important antibiotic for the treatment of severe and life-threatening infections. Many of these patients may have multiple possible causes of leukopenia and/or anemia. An awareness of the potential for piperacillin to cause the rapid onset of leukopenia and/or anemia may have important therapeutic implications, especially in severely ill patients.
The use of zidovudine (AZT) for the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) induces a DNA-depleting mitochondrial myopathy, which is histologically characterized by the presence of muscle fibers with "ragged-red"-like features, red-rimmed or empty cracks, granular degeneration, and rods (AZT fibers). Because dysfunctioning muscle mitochondria may lead to defects of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, we examined the degree of neutral fat accumulation and muscle carnitine levels in the muscle biopsy specimens from 21 patients with AZT-induced myopathic symptoms of varying severity. Six patients with no AZT fibers had normal endomyofibrillar lipid deposits and muscle carnitine levels; 7 patients with fewer than 5 AZT fibers per field had a mild (+) to moderate (++) increase in lipid droplets, and reduced muscle carnitine levels (3 patients); and 8 patients with more than 5 AZT fibers had severe muscle changes, a ++ to marked ( ) increase in lipid droplets, and reduced muscle carnitine levels (6 patients). Serial sections showed lipid globules often within "cracks" or vacuoles of the abnormal muscle fibers. We conclude that the muscle mitochondrial impairment caused by AZT results in (1) accumulation of lipid within the muscle fibers owing to poor utilization of long-chain fatty acids, (2) reduction of muscle carnitine levels probably due to decreased carnitine uptake by the muscle, and (3) depletion of energy stores within the muscle fibers. The findings may have potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of AZT-induced myopathic symptoms using oral carnitine supplementation.
Mercury exposure in both humans and mice is associated with features of systemic autoimmunity. Murine HgCl₂-induced autoimmunity (mHgIA) requires MHC Class II, CD4⁺ T-cells, co-stimulatory molecules, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), similar to spontaneous models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). β₂-microglobulin (B2m) is required for functional MHC Class I molecules and the neonatal F(c) receptor (F(c)Rn). Deficiency of B2m in lupus-prone strains is consistently associated with reduced IgG levels, but with variable effects on other manifestations. Herein, we examined the role of B2m in mHgIA and show that in the absence of B2m, mercury-exposed mice failed to exhibit hypergammaglobulinemia, had reduced anti-nucleolar autoantibodies (ANoA), and had a lower incidence of immune complex deposits in splenic blood vessels, whereas IgG anti-chromatin autoantibodies and renal immune deposits were largely unaffected. Subclass analysis of the IgG anti-chromatin, however, revealed a significant reduction in the IgG₁ subtype. Examination of IFNγ, IL-4, and IL-2 in exposed skin, draining lymph nodes, and spleen following mercury exposure showed reduced IL-4 in the spleen and skin in B2m-deficient mice, consistent with the lower IgG₁ anti-chromatin levels, and reduced IFNγ expression in the skin. These findings demonstrate how a single genetic alteration can partially but significantly modify the clinical manifestations of systemic autoimmunity induced by exposure to xenobiotics.
Aldosterone-producing adenoma, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma are well known but are not common diseases, and few surgeons have experience in adrenalectomy. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has been increasingly performed in Japan, and the number of procedures exceeded 1,000 in 2009. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy comprised less than 20% of all adrenalectomies reported in the USA in 2006. The actual numbers of open and laparoscopic adrenalectomies in Japan are not reported. Single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy has recently been performed. Surgical treatment is the gold standard for adrenocortical carcinoma. Open adrenalectomy is recommended when malignant adrenal tumor is suspected. Adjuvant treatment with mitotane should be administered when indicated for adrenocortical carcinoma. Combination therapy with mitotane and chemotherapy was reported to be beneficial in patients with advanced and metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma. The diagnostic procedures for aldosterone-producing adenoma are still controversial. Plasma metanephrine measurement for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and gene diagnoses for hereditary pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma syndrome are promising. National surveys of pheochromocytoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia have been carried out and they clarified the current status of these diseases in Japan.
We aimed to investigate specific roles of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in the deterioration of endothelial function during the progression of diabetes and the potential therapeutic effects of MAPK inhibitors and agonists in the amelioration of endothelial function. Protein expression and phosphorylation of p38, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) were assessed in mesenteric arteries of 3- (3M) and 9-month-old (9M) male diabetic and control mice. The expression of p38, JNK, and Erk was comparable in all groups of mice, but the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK was increased in 3M and further increased in 9M diabetic mice, whereas the phosphorylation of Erk was substantially reduced in 9M diabetic mice. NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production was significantly increased in vessels of two ages of diabetic mice. Inhibition of either p38 with SB203580 or JNK with SP600125 reduced superoxide production and improved shear stress-induced dilation (SSID) in 3M, but not in 9M, diabetic mice. Treating the vessels of 9M diabetic mice with resveratrol increased Erk phosphorylation and shear stress-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and activity, but resveratrol alone did not improve SSID. Administration of resveratrol and SB203580 or resveratrol and SP600125 together significantly improved SSID in vessels of 9M diabetic mice. The improved response was prevented by U0126, an Erk inhibitor. Thus, p38/JNK-dependent increase in oxidative stress diminished nitric oxide-mediated dilation in vessels of 3M diabetic mice. Oxidative stress and impaired Erk-dependent activation of eNOS exacerbates endothelial dysfunction in the advanced stage of diabetes.
A series of 22 stilbene derivatives based on resveratrol were synthesized incorporating acetoxy-, benzyloxy-, carboxy-, chloro-, hydroxy- and methoxy functional groups. We examined the cytotoxicity of these 22 stilbenes in human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Only four compounds were cytotoxic namely 4'-hydroxy-3-methoxystilbene (15), 3'-acetoxy-4-chlorostilbene (19), 4'-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxystilbene or pterostilbene (3) and 3,5-dibenzyloxy-4'-hydroxystilbene (28) with IC(50)s of 78 µM, 38 µM, 67 µM and 19.5 µM respectively. Further apoptosis assessment on the most potent compound, 28, confirmed that the cells underwent apoptosis based on phosphatidylserine externalization and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Importantly, we observed a concentration-dependent activation of caspase-9 as early as 2 hr with resultant caspase-3 cleavage in 28-induced apoptosis. Additionally, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study proposed a possible mechanism of action for compound 28. Taken together, our data suggests that the pro-apoptotic effects of 28 involve the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway characterized by an early activation of caspase-9.
Transient lesions at the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) have been reported after withdrawal of specific antiepileptic drugs (AED), though the pathophysiology of the lesions remains unclear. We examined and treated a schizophrenic patient who developed a transient SCC lesion after withdrawal of the AED, carbamazepine. Interestingly, the SCC lesion was accompanied by the onset of diabetes insipidus, a state of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) insufficiency. Because carbamazepine is shown to potentiate the effect of AVP, our case suggests that an insufficiency of AVP followed by withdrawal of AED could contribute to the pathogenesis of a transient SCC lesion.
Previous studies have shown that thymoquinone (TQ) exerts protective effects in some models of pesticide-induced immunotoxicity. However, no data exist regarding its possible modulatory effect during imidacloprid (IC)-induced toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of TQ on IC-induced immunotoxicity. Sixty adult male albino rats were divided into three groups of twenty animals each. The control group was given distilled water orally, while the IC-treated group was orally administered 0.01 LD(50 )(0.21 mg/kg body weight) of IC insecticide daily for 28 days. The animals in the third group (IC/TQ group) received the same IC dose as the IC-treated group for 28 days in addition to an intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection of TQ (1 mg/kg) once every 7 days. We found that IC induced significant increases (P < 0.05) in total leukocyte counts, total immunoglobulins (Igs) (especially IgGs), the hemagglutination of antibodies, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) compared to the control group. In contrast, significant decreases (P < 0.05) in phagocytic activity, chemokine expression and chemotaxis were observed in the IC-treated group, as were severe histopathological lesions in the liver, spleen and thymus. Notably, TQ supplementation ameliorated the biochemical, histopathological, and immunological changes induced by IC by increasing phagocytic activity, chemokinesis, chemotaxis, immunoglobulin levels, and the hemagglutination of antibodies, as well as by decreasing hepatic enzymes and serum MDA levels. Taken together, our data reveal the benefits of TQ supplementation for ameliorating IC toxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and enhancing immune efficiency.
The aim of these studies was to examine whether amphetamine-induced sensitization in rats could be used as an animal model to study the basis of certain abnormalities seen in schizophrenia. Specifically, these experiments examined whether rats subjected to a sensitizing regimen of amphetamine would show the sensorimotor gating and greater amphetamine-induced displacement of radio-raclopride binding deficit that is observed in schizophrenia. In the first experiment, animals were divided into two groups with each rat receiving an intraperitoneal injection of amphetamine (AMPH) or saline (SAL) (1 ml/kg) three times per week for 3 weeks for a total of nine injections. AMPH dose was increased weekly from 1 mg/kg in the first week to 3 mg/kg in the third. Twenty-two days after the last injection, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response was tested. In addition, rats were tested for the effects of a challenge dose of 0.5 mg/kg AMPH on locomotor activity and [3H]raclopride (RAC) binding potential (BP) in the striatum. The tests for PPI confirmed that sensorimotor gating was disrupted in the AMPH-induced sensitized-state rats at baseline. The AMPH-sensitized rats also exhibited higher locomotor response to AMPH and a lower binding of striatal [3H]raclopride when challenged with the drug. The results were replicated and even more pronounced in rats that were treated with AMPH for 5 weeks, with doses ranging from 1mg/kg in the first week to 5 mg/kg in the fifth. These sensorimotor gating deficits and neurochemical (greater AMPH-induced displacement of radio-raclopride binding) abnormalities show similarities with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and suggest that the AMPH-sensitized-state rats could be used to model certain aspects of schizophrenia.
Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in a range of plant products, may exert a variety of pharmacological activities. In this study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo, and we found that the pretreatment with resveratrol can effectively protect mice against LPS-induced ALI. Mice were pretreated with 1 mg/kg resveratrol for 3 days before challenging with a dose of 15 mg/kg LPS. The histological result showed that resveratrol can suppress the edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and alveolar structure damage of lungs in ALI mice, and a decrease in the lung W/D ratio was also observed in mice with resveratrol pretreatment. Additionally, resveratrol markedly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and MIP-1α and prevented the release of nitric oxide (NO) through inhibiting the expression of inducible NO synthase in lung tissues. Furthermore, the pretreatment with resveratrol suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in lung tissues, which may be partly responsible for its effect on the ALI. In conclusion, the results presented here may suggest resveratrol as a potential therapeutic agent for treating ALI in the future.
Acute pericarditis has been described as an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as a consequence of IBD treatment, specifically sulfasalazine and mesalamine. Until now, there have been no reported cases of constrictive pericarditis associated with IBD or its treatment. A 37-year-old woman with a 24-year history of chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) presented with a 3-month history of fevers, palpitations, dyspnea, syncope, and retrosternal chest pain. Two weeks before symptoms, she had initiated oral mesalamine for an ongoing CUC flare. Physical examination suggested constrictive pericarditis. An echocardiogram revealed a thickened pericardium with a nearly circumferential fibrinous effusion, with Doppler confirming diastolic compromise. The patient proceeded to radical pericardectomy. Pathological examination showed grossly hemorrhagic acute and chronic pericarditis, with cultures and cytology negative. To date, only 104 cases of IBD with acute pericarditis have been reported, with fewer than 10 cases of mesalamine-induced acute pericarditis reported. This is the first reported case of constrictive pericarditis related to IBD or its treatment. Although our patient may have had IBD-associated constrictive pericarditis, her mesalamine use raises the possibility of a drug-induced constrictive pericarditis.
